FT  29 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mozambique begins to rebuild
its cashew revenues - The prospects for the country's second biggest export
earner following the ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN REVIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOZAMBIQUE, once the world's leading cashew nut producer, has begun to
rebuild its industry following last year's ceasefire in the civil war. The
objective is to match again the output of India and Brazil, which have
occupied first and second places since 1977, when fighting began seriously
to disrupt production in the former Portuguese colony.
Cashew is Mozambique's second biggest value export crop after prawns, an
industry less affected by the war, which Britain is helping to modernise
through the refitting of trawlers and building of a new jetty at Angoche on
the Indian Ocean coast.
Cotton and sugar also earn hard currency for Mozambique, but hydro-electric
power exports to South Africa from the Cahora Bassa dam had to be stopped
during the war years, which also saw a big drop in revenues for rail transit
between Indian ocean ports and land-locked states. In the absence of oil or
big mineral discoveries Mozambique is reliant on aid for most of its foreign
exchange inflows. So it needs all the nuts it can gather to promote greater
economic independence. Fortunately demand for cashew is high and the
Mozambique variety attracts an average price for all grades of Dollars 3.20
per kilogram of kernal.
Mr Juliano Saranga, the Frelimo government's secretary of state for cashew,
returned in early April from a meeting of the African Development Bank in
Abidjan, the Ivory Coast's capital, with an agreement for an additional
Dollars 20m of funding for a further five-year rehabilitation and
development programme.
The minister believes output from existing trees, which are expected to
yield only 35,000 tonnes during the October - March 1992-93 season, could be
doubled within three years with improved husbandry. That would still be well
below the record year of 1972 when Mozambique's 216,000 tonnes were more
than four times Indian output.
He points out that the smallholders in coastal regions who fled during the
war were returning to neglected trees, sometimes in areas where there were
no roads to distribute the pesticides to combat mildew.
The fall in output to 35,000 tonnes from 54,000 tonnes in the 1991-2 season
 -a year when Brazil came first with 190,000 and India produced 140,000
tonnes - was party caused by natural variations in yield, he explained. But
the main problem in all areas was collection. Traders - who buy nuts from
smallholders at a minimum price set by the government and then sell them on
at unregulated prices to wholesalers for delivery and sale again to the
processing factories - could not afford to borrow money at the ruling 45 per
cent interest rate. As a consequence smallholders increasingly bartered
their nuts locally or included them in their own cooking in place of
groundnuts.
The ADB money, along with that received from the the World Bank, which also
has a long-term cashew support programme in Mozambique, is being used to
provide extension workers, develop tree nurseries, introduce improved
Brazilian grafts, modernise factories and to make a detailed survey of
trees.
Mr Saranga is convinced that the future lies with providing support for the
smallholders and not large, state-funded orchards that were abandoned 10
years ago. Smallholders, usually families cultivating about 10 trees
intercropped with maize, cassava and cow peas and producing nuts in October
and March, now account for 90 per cent of the harvest.
The state role is also being eliminated in processing as buyers or joint
venture operators are sought for remaining state factories. Four factories
are now privately owned - two by the Anglo American Corporation and two by
Portuguese concerns. Two of the remaining state factories are in the process
of privatisation and investors are also sought for new factories so that all
nuts can be processed within Mozambique.
Two years ago, after 15 years of handling the total crop from tree to
roasted kernel, Mozambique had to revert to exporting raw nuts to India for
cracking and roasting because of inadequate local capacity. About a third of
the current October-March season crops will be exported to India in raw
form.

GOLD slipped around Dollars 3 a troy ounce on the London bullion market as
Comex opened and took profits early. Dealers said that the market was
pushing lower purely on the back of technical factors, and they did not rule
out a rebound. However, the further gold drifted from Dollars 380, then the
less likely it would be that option-related buying would come into the
market and boost prices. ALUMINIUM continued to be underpinned on the LME by
speculation that a big trading operation was being played out ahead of an
announcement on production cuts. But no-one could pin down the possible
source of such news. London COCOA ended near the day's lows, depressed by
both the strength of sterling and a downside correction after the recent
climb to a three-month peak. COFFEE was range-bound in both London and New
York. London's September contract was stuck between solid support at Dollars
900 and resistance around Dollars 940 a tonne. New York traders said they
were continuing to assess news that Latin American producers intended to
retain 15 per cent of their production from October 1 in an effort to
bolster prices.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Palladium reaches 39-month high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICE of palladium, a platinum group metal used mainly in consumer
electrical goods and as a dental alloy, reached Dollars 132.15 a troy ounce
in London yesterday - its highest level for 39 months.
Traders say palladium is gaining ground because of very strong physical
demand from Japan, almost certainly from the electrical sector, and from US
electrical goods producers.
Supply shortages have pushed the rate for leasing palladium to 11 per cent,
the highest for over two years and well above the cost of money. High lease
rates add to the pressure on physical supply because they encourage
consumers to buy instead of lease the metal.
Mr Neil Carson, marketing director, platinum, for Johnson Matthey, the
world's biggest platinum marketing group, pointed out that the Russians, who
contribute about half the world's palladium, held the key to future prices.
'The Russians usually increase sales when the price rises but this time
there has been no sign of them doing that,' he said. Palladium was a
by-product of Russian nickel production and the country had little use for
it, so it must be assumed that Russia had ample stocks.
Mr Carson pointed out that electrical industry consumers, who accounted for
47 per cent of western world demand for the metal last year, 'capped' the
palladium price when it reached between Dollars 150 and Dollars 200 an ounce
by substituting other materials, though this was not easy and was expensive.
The electrical industry bought 1.83m of the 3.9m ounces of palladium used in
the western world last year, for use mainly in multi-layer ceramic
capacitors found in products such as computers, video recorders and electric
windows in cars, Johnson Matthey estimated in its recent market review.
Demand for palladium in the western world was 70,000 ounces higher than
supply last year, it suggested. Demand rose to 3.9m ounces, boosted by
higher use in automotive catalysts (which now account for about 10 per cent
of the palladium market) while supply fell to 3.83m ounces, mainly because
of lower Russian sales.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Continuing battle for grain
sales forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHRONIC financial difficulties faced by China and Russia will continue
to dog the international grain markets in 1993-94, according to the latest
report from the International Wheat Council.
The two countries are the main outlets for grain exporters, who are likely
to compete vigorously for sales, the IWC suggests.
China is reported to have had buying teams in the big exporting countries,
'but no new sales were apparent', says the report. 'Reported foreign
exchange shortages have supplemented China's usual aggressive pursuit of
lower prices.'
Russia, which has amassed large debts for earlier shipments, 'will depend on
new financing initiatives to meet its import needs in 1993-94'.
World wheat trade fell by 4m tonnes to 103m tonnes in the year to the end of
June. Chinese imports were halved, while those to the former Soviet Union
fell by less than expected. However, these declines were offset by increased
imports to India, Africa and eastern Europe, while demand for
weather-damaged wheat for animal feed was strong.
Next year demand growth in many developing countries - such as Indonesia,
Malaysia and the Philippines - will continue to underpin world wheat trade,
the report predicts.
The IWC is forecasting wheat production for 1993-94 at 560m tonnes, slightly
below last year but still the third biggest on record.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Speculation over interest rate cut fuels
French prices surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE stood tall in a strong European government bond market yesterday as
rate cut enthusiasm held sway and drove prices forward.
However, the yield spread between 10-year French and German government bonds
remained slightly wider, at eight basis points, as Germany also benefited
from encouraging inflation data.
On the Matif, French government bond futures for September shot ahead by
more than half a point during official trading. They broke through 120
before late profit-taking took the contract back to 119.92, still a gain of
60 basis points on the day.
Some economists are starting to feel the value in the French market is
beginning to dry up. Although Ms Marie Owens Thomsen of Midland Global
Markets takes that line, she believes France still has room for three more
25-basis point cuts in its intervention rate - the rate that sets the floor
for official rates - independently of any German move.
Part of yesterday's rise sprang from a technical correction after falls on
Friday. However, there was also a boost from signals coming out of Germany:
if Germany can cut rates it will give the Banque de France much greater room
for manoeuvre.
Interest in the French market was fuelled by a press report arguing that
France might quit the European exchange rate mechanism if Germany refused to
ease monetary policy. Economists said the report was refuted by French
officials and had no impact on prices. However, it did encourage fierce
debate.
GERMAN debt prices picked up in reaction to comments from the Bundesbank and
reassuring economic data.
The comments came from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank,
who indicated in a radio interview he would be keen for German interest
rates to fall.
Also, the market was surprised by the latest consumer prices data, which
showed inflation rising at 0.1 per cent against 0.3 per cent a month ago.
September bunds bounced 0.33 per cent to 95.67.
However, there was a growing consensus that the Bundesbank will leave its
discount rate unchanged at 7.25 per cent when it meets on Thursday for its
fortnightly council meeting. Most economists are now looking ahead to the
following meeting on July 15. That meeting comes just befores the G7 meeting
in Tokyo, and just after the German cabinet's budget proposals.
'The Bundesbank is looking for the right pre-conditions to cut rates. We
need something astonishing and the inflation change is not it,' said one
economist.
UK government bonds rose sharply as a stronger pound prompted continued
overseas buying of gilts. A survey of dealers and analysts in the weekend
press found that almost half of the specialists interviewed believed
sterling would become the strongest currency in Europe over the next three
months.
The well-timed research sent the pound jumping sharply in early trade to hit
DM2.54. That strength gave a renewed incentive to the overseas investors,
particularly those from the Far East, who have been switching out of 10-year
French bonds and into the UK equivalent.
Long-dated gilts performed most strongly as investors held stock ahead of
tomorrow's auction of Pounds 3.25bn of 8 per cent 10-year gilts.
In the futures market, the September gilts contract was up half a percentage
point before profit-taking took it back to close  9/32 higher at 107 5/32 .
IN the high-yielding European government bond markets, Spain and Italy were
overshadowed by political worries.
The struggle by Mr Carlo Ciampi, the Italian prime minister, to force
employers and trade unions to agree on a new wage bargaining system lay
behind weakness in Italian government bonds. Alone in Europe, the government
bond futures market was weaker with the September contract falling 28 basis
points to 102.32.
However, Spanish bonds for September clawed back some of Friday's losses in
spite of enduring concern over prime minister Mr Felipe Gonzales' ability to
form a coalition government. September bonds traded in Barcelona bounced
0.60 point to 92.90 after a 1.25 point slide on Friday.
Portuguese bonds rose after the Bank of Portugal cut its intervention rate
by half a point to 11.5 per cent.
OVERNIGHT demand from foreign investors, the lack of supply pressures, and
expectations that Friday's employment report for June will be weak pushed US
Treasury bond yields to historic lows yesterday.
In late trade, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  13/16 at 105
13/16 , yielding 6.669 per cent, the lowest yield in the 16 years that the
Treasury has been selling the issue on a regular basis. At the short end,
the two-year note was only slightly firmer, however, up 1/16 at 100 1/8 , to
yield 4.043 per cent.
Prices opened firmer in the wake of demand from overseas markets -
particularly London - believed to have been a follow-through from heavy
buying on Friday, when bond yields closed at an all-time low.
The influence of foreign trading aside, the market in New York was otherwise
supported by two factors: expectations that Friday's jobs data will be
weaker than originally forecast, and the lack of fresh supply in coming
weeks.

FT  29 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Strong overseas demand for first
sterling deal from Osaka Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO sterling deals, for Sweden and Osaka Gas, were the main focus of
attention in a lively session yesterday. Weekend newspaper reports boosted
positive sentiment on the pound, which followed through into the gilt and
Eurosterling bond markets.
The Osaka Gas deal, which was widely marketed last week, caught investor
interest, partly because it was its first issue in the sterling bond market.
Dealers said the deal was rapidly sold out.
According to the lead manager, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, demand for sterling
paper from overseas meant that the deal was heavily oversubscribed. However,
placement was concentrated among UK investors, as Osaka Gas designed the
issue to expand its investor base in the UK.
The company raises a large proportion of its debt in the Eurobond market,
and has already tapped the French franc, dollar, Euroyen and D-Mark sectors.
The Pounds 150m, 10-year issue was priced to yield 40 basis points over the
comparable gilt, which dealers said was an attractive level for a
utility-rated AA2 by Moody's and AA- by Standard and Poor's. By the end of
the day, the spread had tightened to 38 basis points over the gilt yield.
Mr Yasuo Ryoki, senior assistant manager of the finance department at Osaka
Gas, said the deal had been swapped into fixed-rate yen at a level that was
'very competitive' with the Japanese long-term prime rate.
He said his company would launch a small Euroyen deal today.
Sweden's Pounds 350m seven-year issue met a slightly less enthusiastic
response, though it also benefited from demand for sterling bonds, and from
improving sentiment on Sweden's credit-worthiness.
Last year, when the Swedish kronor was devalued amid currency turmoil and
the country's economy was widely perceived to be in severe difficulty,
spreads on Sweden's Eurobonds widened dramatically.
They have, however, improved steadily since the start of this year. For
example, Sweden's recent Ecu500m, seven-year deal, launched at 5 basis
points over the comparable Ecu OAT, is now trading at 14 basis points below.
While some of Sweden's debt fell prey to asset-swappers last year, this deal
represents floating-rate funding of around Libor flat, according to dealers.
Dealers said the seven-year maturity was attractive, since there had been a
lack of paper in that area of the yield curve this year. According to
co-lead manager JP Morgan, there has been Pounds 5.8bn of five-year paper,
Pounds 4bn of 10-year paper, and just Pounds 600m of seven-year paper to
date.
Nevertheless, the pricing of the deal was perceived as slightly aggressive
at a launch spread of 33 basis points over the 9 per cent gilt due 2000.
In the dollar market, Tokyo Electric Power Company launched a large Dollars
1bn, 10-year issue via Goldman Sachs. Dealers reported strong demand from
eastern Asia but said European investors had been distracted by speculation
about European interest rates and currencies, and were not currently
focusing on the dollar sector.
Goldman took the lion's share of the deal, which was launched at 36 basis
points over the 10-year US Treasury.
In the D-Mark sector, Turkey launched a DM500m deal, increased to DM750m,
via DG Bank. The deal was priced at 220 basis points over the comparable
Bund.
Peugeot Finance International has announced a Pounds 100m Euro commercial
paper programme, with a multi-currency option. The programme is rated A1 by
Standard &amp; Poor's.

FT  29 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: CBOT may lose main stock
index contract
</HEADLINE>

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Chicago Board of Trade may lose the right to trade its biggest stock
index futures contract, the Major Market Index.
The CBOT's cross-town rival, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, is negotiating
to add the product to its own cache of stock index futures products. The New
York Futures Exchange is also lobbying to obtain rights to trade MMI
futures.
The CBOT trades MMI futures under licence from the American Stock Exchange,
which invented the 20-stock high capitalisation index in 1983. The Amex
trades options on the instrument, which is designed to track the movements
of the closely-watched Dow Jones Industrial Average.
The CBOT's agreement with the Amex expires in October. It is understood that
the Amex is considering a more profitable venue for the futures contract,
and this could possibly end 10 years of co-operation with the CBOT.
Although the CBOT's MMI futures traded in excess of 10,000 contracts per day
before the 1987 stock market crash, daily volume has since fallen to about
800 contracts. Fewer than 25 CBOT members are committed to trading the index
futures.
The CME is thought to be a strong contender for the MMI, because it has
several hundred traders dealing in its successful S&amp;P 500 stock index
futures pit. CME traders say the MMI would provide spreading opportunities
with the broad-based S&amp;P 500 futures.
Ms Kathy Fitzpatrick, Amex spokeswoman, confirmed the Amex was talking with
the CME about the MMI futures licence, but said no decision has been made.
Mr Fred Grede, the CBOT's vice-president for administration, said the
exchange was in negotiations with the Amex to retain the MMI contract. He
expected a decision during July.

FT  29 JUN 93 / International Company News: Corning bids Dollars 370m for
Damon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CORNING INC, the US high-technology group, yesterday launched a rival
Dollars 370m bid for Damon Corporation, a medical testing laboratory group
which last week agreed to be acquired for Dollars 258m by National Health
Laboratories.
Corning already runs one of the largest clinical lab businesses in the US,
called MetPath, and the takeover of Damon would put it in contention for the
leadership of the sector with first-ranked SmithKline Beecham.
Corning's cash tender offer, which values Damon at Dollars 23 a share
compared to NHL's Dollars 16 a share, was regarded on Wall Street as a
probable knock-out blow, since a much higher offer from NHL would
substantially dilute its 1993 earnings. There was no immediate reaction from
Damon.
The offer was welcomed by the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, Damon's
largest shareholder, with 9.6 per cent. Last week it said it would try to
block the NHL bid because it was 'well below' fair value.
Mr James Houghton, chairman of Corning, said the takeover would be excellent
for Corning financially, since it was expected to have a neutral impact on
earnings in the first year and contribute significantly to earnings
thereafter.
Analysts said the bid would be good for Corning in that it would strengthen
the company's position in several local markets, and that it would keep
assets out of competitors' hands.

LTV, the US steel company at the centre of one of the longest and most
contentious US bankruptcies, is coming back to the stock market, writes
Nikki Tait. The New York Stock Exchange has approved trading of LTV's new
common stock and its series A warrants on a 'when-issued' basis. The return
marks the end of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy process which began in 1986.

THE situation at Northwest Airlines, the heavily-indebted US carrier which
is expected to file for bankruptcy protection if it cannot secure
significant labour concessions, remained unresolved late yesterday, writes
Nikki Tait. The company said directors of Northwest's parent company were
briefed on the status of talks with the airline's pilots, which had
continued over the weekend, and were in favour of reaching 'a voluntary

GUINNESS, the brewing group, has underwritten an investment of N750m
(Dollars 27m) in Guinness Nigeria, writes Paul Adams in Lagos.
The investment is the largest made in Guinness Nigeria. Nigeria is the
third-largest market for Guinness, after Ireland and the UK. In 1992, the
company increased pre-tax profits by 40 per cent to N238m.
Guinness Nigeria will issue irredeemable convertible loan stock structured
by First City Merchant Bank in Lagos. It will not be eligible for repayment
and the interest rate will be linked to the yield on Guinness Nigeria's
shares.
The loan stock will be raised in foreign currency but denominated in naira,
which allows the company a fixed rate of exchange at the date of issue.
Most of Guinness's costs are for imported capital goods and spare parts.
Last year, Guinness Nigeria raised N150m on the local stock market just
before it lost 80 per cent of its foreign exchange value in the March 1992
devaluation.
The proposed new investment has important implications for the future
ownership of the company. Foreign equity ownership is limited to 40 per
cent. Guinness holds 25 per cent and Unilever 15 per cent.

DEBENTURE holders of Unigesco, the holding company of Mr Bertin Nadeau, the
Montreal entrepreneur, have cleared the way for the sale of his 26 per cent
controlling stake in Univa, Canada's second biggest food distributor.
The stake is changing hands for almost CDollars 200m (USDollars 156m). Mr
Nadeau has controlled Univa since 1986 through the heavily indebted
Unigesco, his own holding company.
Unigesco faces a CDollars 45m debenture maturity this month. Last week, the
debenture-holders approved the sale of 26 per cent of Univa plus a general
restructuring of Unigesco's borrowings.
The buyer of 22.5 per cent of Unigesco was the Caisse de Depot, the Quebec
public pension fund manager.
The balance of the stake was taken up by the Ontario Teachers Pension Board
in exchange for a CDollars 25m Unigesco debenture.

FT  29 JUN 93 / International Company News: Anheuser-Busch takes 5% stake in
Chinese brewer

<TEXT>
TSINGTAO Brewery, China's largest beer exporter, will today become the first
Chinese registered company to issue shares in Hong Kong, via an offer of 'H'
shares to raise HKDollars 889m (USDollars 115m).
The proceeds include the HKDollars 126m purchase of a 5 per cent stake by
Anheuser-Busch, the largest US brewer, which is buying 45m shares as a
strategic investment to expand its presence in China.
Faced with a mature market at home and a patchy diversification record,
Anheuser has been emphasising plans to expand geographically. Since the
start of the year, it has struck deals in Italy, Japan and Mexico - in the
last case, by buying a 17.7 per cent interest in Grupo Modelo, the leading
local producer.
Analysts believe that Tsingtao's internationally-recognised brand name and
its access to the Chinese market will ensure that the issue is massively
oversubscribed.
Denway Investment, the Hong Kong holding company for a Chinese car
manufac-turing business, set the record for oversubscription in February,
when its HKDollars 402m public offer attracted HKDollars 240bn from
investors.
The recent weakness of the Chinese currency has dampened demand for shares
in Chinese companies but as a major exporter, Tsingtao will be comparatively
unaffected.
It is the first of nine state companies selected by China's Securities
Committee for flotation in Hong Kong and the Chinese government will be
anxious to attract a positive response for the issue.
Tsingtao is offering 317.6m new shares at HKDollars 2.80 per share,
representing 35 per cent of its enlarged issued share capital.
A further 11 per cent of Tsingtao's shares are earmarked for Chinese
investors, in the form of 'A' shares, to be traded on the Shanghai stock
exchange. This was scaled down, as a result of the lacklustre performance of
the Chinese stock markets, and the government's desire to see savings
channelled into bonds.
Tsingtao's profits are forecast to rise to Yn193m (Dollars 33m) this year
from Yn44m in 1992. However, there is unlikely to be any significant further
growth until 1995, when its fourth brewery will be completed.
Three other state companies, Shanghai Petrochemical, Guangzhou Shipyard and
Beijing Renmin Machinery, are also due to launch offers within the next
month.

FT  29 JUN 93 / International Company News: Primerica backs investment
veteran against Merrill - Robert Greenhill has been snapped up to strengthen
the group's weak link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR SANFORD Weill's delight was undisguised when he announced last week that
Mr Robert Greenhill, the former president of Morgan Stanley, had agreed to
be chairman and chief executive of Smith Barney Shearson.
Mr Weill, chairman of the financial services group Primerica, had created
Smith Barney Shearson in March when he bought the stockbroking and asset
management business of Shearson Lehman from American Express, and merged it
with Primerica's Smith Barney securities unit.
The Dollars 1bn merger created a brokerage house to rival almost any on Wall
Street. Yet the new operation, for all its strengths in retail stockbroking
and asset management, lacked a presence in one crucial area - investment
banking. When Smith Barney, a purely retail firm, merged with Shearson
Lehman, the latter's investment banking operation had stayed with American
Express.
At the time of the Shearson acquisition, Mr Weill appeared content to
concentrate on retail stockbroking. Yet, the unexpected availability of Mr
Greenhill, who suddenly stepped down as Morgan Stanley president in March
having missed out in the race to be chairman, clearly revived his interest
in turning Smith Barney Shearson into an investment banking powerhouse as
well.
In the 56-year-old Mr Greenhill Mr Weill has landed not only a close friend
and adviser (the two are neighbours in Connecticut), but one of Wall
Street's premier investment bankers.
In his 31-year career at Morgan Stanley, Mr Greenhill created the firm's
mergers department and later ran its investment banking business for 13
years.
During the 1980s he worked on some of the biggest corporate deals of the
era, servicing a roster of blue-chip clients that included IBM, General
Motors and RJR Nabisco.
The former Morgan Stanley banker now has the job of building up Smith Barney
Shearson's investment banking muscle to the point where the firm can wrestle
with the only integrated brokerage and investment banking firm on Wall
Street of a comparable size - Merrill Lynch.
It is a formidable task. The two firms are in the same league when it comes
to retail broking; Merrill has 12,700 brokers, who generated brokerage
commissions of Dollars 714m in the first quarter of this year; Smith Barney
Shearson has 11,600 brokers, who brought in a combined Dollars 576m of
commissions over the three months.
Merrill also has the lead in asset management, with about Dollars 500bn of
US customer assets under its control, compared with Dollars 310bn for Smith
Barney Shearson.
It is in the investment banking arena, however, that Merrill dwarfs the
Primerica unit. In the first quarter, Merrill's revenues from investment
banking totalled Dollars 445m, whereas Smith Barney Shearson's combined
revenues were only Dollars 121m.
Mr Greenhill's job is to close that gap.
There is plenty of logic behind the move into investment banking. At the
best integrated securities firms, the retail stockbroking and investment
banking businesses have a truly symbiotic relationship - the brokers need
the investment bankers to create products (corporate stocks and bonds) that
they can sell, while the investment bankers need the brokers' network of
investors to sell their products.
If Smith Barney Shearson chose not to develop an investment banking
operation, the distribution capabilities of its retail broking business
would go to waste.
As Mr Weill put it last week: 'We're going to build . . . a great investment
banking and brokerage company. It would be very hard to be terrific in one
part and not terrific in another part.'
Or, as Mr John Keefe, an independent securities industry analyst, says:
'With all that new sales capacity which came with Shearson, they needed a
bigger investment banking presence.'
Mr Weill's ambition to build an integrated securities house, however, is not
easily achieved. Merrill remains the only firm successfully to run large
broking and investment banking businesses side by side. The last one that
tried, Shearson Lehman, failed miserably, and the attempt ended in American
Express selling Shearson's broking business to Primerica.
Smith Barney Shearson could run into one of the problems that bedeviled
Shearson Lehman - the inability of two different business cultures to mix.
At Shearson Lehman, the blue-blooded, relationship-oriented world of
investment banking clashed with the more free-wheeling, sales-oriented world
of retail stockbroking, and the result was a lot of unhappy executives, not
much synergy, and disappointing earnings.
The culture clash issue is real. Mr Greenhill is a characteristically
cultivated and reserved Morgan Stanley banker, while his new colleagues at
Smith Barney Shearson (especially the firm's president-to-be, retail chief
Mr Joseph Plumeri) are motivational managers used to handling an army of
hard-selling brokers. Mr Greenhill, however, is not unnerved by the prospect
of working alongside an entirely new breed of Wall Street professional: 'It
should be a lot of fun,' he says.
Throughout his business career, the Primerica chairman has generally had a
good sense of timing, but some analysts question Mr Weill's decision to push
Smith Barney Shearson into investment banking at a time when the business is
enjoying an unprecedented boom. Some fear the current strength of the market
may cause Smith Barney Shearson to expand too much, too quickly.
Although he applauds the hiring of Mr Greenhill, industry analyst Mr Keefe
says: 'My concern is how much the industry can stand . . . especially when
the business gets tough again. This is a difficult environment from which to
judge the future because it's so active and so profitable.'
Although Smith Barney Shearson plans to shed about 1,200 support staff
following the merger of the two firms, it will soon start hiring investment
bankers. Fortunately, several years of industry consolidations mean there is
a large pool of unemployed bankers waiting to return to Wall Street.
Mr Weill will also be hoping that Mr Greenhill brings some of his old Morgan
Stanley clients with him to Smith Barney Shearson. 'It's a free country, and
clients will do business with whom clients want to do business.'
The new Smith Barney Shearson chairman does not lack an incentive to work
hard. Three days after he agreed to take the job, Mr Greenhill spent Dollars
35m of his own money on Primerica stock. The day after, the stock price
climbed 7 per cent on the news of his hiring, adding Dollars 2.4m to the
value of his holding.
The price rise added considerably more to Mr Weill's substantially bigger
stake in Primerica - another reason for last week's smiles.

<TEXT>
EASTERN Sugar, a joint venture between Tate &amp; Lyle, the UK-based sugar and
sweeteners group, and Generale Sucriere of France, has bought a 51 per cent
stake in Juhocukor, a Slovakian beet sugar refiner.
Eastern Sugar already holds a 34.6 per cent stake in Kabai Cukorgyar, a
Hungarian sugar beet processor.
The joint venture will invest 441m Slovakian crowns (Dollars 14.8m) in
Juhocukor over four years, partly in cash and partly through a technology
deal. This will include subscribing to an increase in share capital, taking
Eastern Sugar's stake to 66 per cent.
The remaining shares in Juhocukor are held by investment funds and
individuals.
Juhocukor produces 30,000 tonnes of sugar a year, compared to consumption in
the Slovak Republic of up to 200,000 tonnes a year. The country produces
about 150,000 tonnes and imports the balance from the Czech Republic.
Generale Sucriere is a subsidiary of Saint-Louis, the French food and paper
group.

record oil group sell-off

<TEXT>
THE Argentine government has sold Dollars 3.04bn of stock in the state oil
and gas company YPF in one of the world's largest privatisations. It is the
biggest single equity offering from the developing world.
With the initial public offering heavily over-subscribed, the government was
able to increase the number of shares available from 125m to 160m, or to 45
per cent of the company. The stock was priced at Dollars 19, at the upper
end of the previously-announced range of Dollars 17 to Dollars 20.
Argentina's success will be seen as proof of its acceptance by international
financial markets, and as a vital fillip to its economic reform programme.
The government will use the proceeds from the privatisation to pay off debts
owed to pensioners, thus giving the ruling party's fortunes a lift in the
run-up to October's Congressional elections.
Brokers said demand for YPF was especially high in the US, with its original
allotment of over Dollars 1bn more than four times over-subscribed. In
Argentina, caution turned into enthusiasm as those willing to invest more
than Dollars 10,000 reportedly bid more than 10 times their allotment.
The privatisation will be concluded when the government sells a second part
of the company to employees and pensioners.
The sale marks the first time a large Latin America country has given up
control of its state oil company, traditionally seen in the region as a
symbol of nationalism and self-sufficiency.
Mexico and Chile, pioneers of economic reform in Latin America, have held on
to their largest state companies, Petroleos Mexicanos and Codelco
respectively.
The transaction was co-ordinated by CS First Boston and Merrill Lynch.

<TEXT>
INCO, the international nickel producer, is severing the bulk of its gold
interests by disposing of its entire 62 per cent stake in TVX Gold of
Toronto.
Inco yesterday raised about CDollars 386m, before commissions, by selling
its 81m TVX shares at a price of CDollars 4.65 each to an underwriting
syndicate led by Wood Gundy and Burns Fry of Toronto.
An official at Burns Fry said the shares were re-sold to outside investors
within an hour of being put on the market yesterday morning. About 40 per
cent were distributed in the US and Europe. The US tranche was privately
placed with institutional investors.
Until last week, Inco gave no indication that it was interested in selling
the TVX stake. But depressed world nickel prices have increased pressure to
raise cash by disposing of peripheral assets.
Inco suffered a USDollars 22.6m loss in the first three months of this year
and has long-term debt of close to Dollars 1bn. It is expected to post a
CDollars 300m gain from the TVX sale, which is due to close next month.
TVX has interests in six gold and silver mines in North and South America.
Their production totalled a record 406,000 ounces of gold and gold
equivalent in 1992.
Alcoa, North America's largest aluminium producer, is to cut its US primary
aluminium production by 268,000 metric tonnes within the next three weeks
and lay off 750 workers at five locations in a dramatic effort to reduce
world aluminium overcapacity, writes Laurie Morse in Chicago. The cuts
represent nearly 25 per cent of its 1.3m tonnes US smelting capacity.
Analysts lauded Alcoa's action as a means of boosting flagging aluminium
prices, but said reductions of at least 600,000 tonnes are needed before
world aluminium supply and demand return to balance. The states of the
former Soviet Union have flooded world markets with primary aluminium in the
last two years. London Metals Exchange stocks have risen to nearly 2m tonnes
since 1990, and hundreds of thousands more tons sit in unregistered
positions.
Mr. Paul O'Neill, Alcoa's chairman, said the plant shutdowns and job losses
were the direct result of a 'lack of any mechanism to deal with the economic
consequences of the dissolution of the former Soviet Union'.

LTV, the US steel company at the centre of one of the longest and most
contentious US bankruptcies is coming back to the stock market, writes Nikki
Tait in New York.
The company said yesterday the New York Stock Exchange had approved trading
of LTV's new common stock and its series A warrants on a 'when issued'
basis.
The return marks the end of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy process which began in
July 1986. LTV finally had a plan of reorganisation confirmed by the
bankruptcy court on May 27.

FT  29 JUN 93 / International Company News: Norwegian shipowner wins control
of Investa

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANDERS Wilhelmsen, the privately-owned Norwegian shipowner, has acquired
control of Investa, the unlisted Norwegian investment group, for NKr350m
(Dollars 48.8m) from a group of 34 financial creditors.
Investa collapsed last August under the weight of NKr3.4bn in debt, of which
NKr2.8bn was in unsecured loans in the form of debt notes and commercial
paper.
The deal brings Wilco, Wilhelmsen's main subsidiary, an 87.8 per cent stake
in Investa and an 90.2 per cent stake in the Norwegian Golar Nor group,
which owns the Petrojarl oil and gas production testing vessel.
Mr Endre Ording Sund, chief executive of Anders Wilhelmsen, said yesterday
his company planned to develop Golar Nor, which has had six owners in the
past eight years. Mr Sund said several companies had expressed interest in
becoming a joint partner.
The deal also gives the group 80 per cent of the shares of Nydalen Company,
an Oslo bourse-listed real estate company, which has about 500,000 sq m of
property in Norway. Wilhelmsen will also secure control of Nydalen's board.
Wilhelmsen also gets a 47 per cent stake in Euronav, the French shipowner,
in which it will gain a seat on the board.
The deal also brings Wilhelmsen a 7.5 per cent stake in Vard, the Norwegian
cruise and ferry group. Mr Sund said his company intended to be a long-term
investor in Vard, whose shares he feels are considerably under-priced.
Yesterday, Vard's shares closed on the Oslo bourse NKr1.25 lower at
NKr16.25.
Wilhelmsen already holds 50 per cent of Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, the
world's second-biggest cruise group and Vard's main competitor.
Mr Sund said his company was likely to gain full control of Investa and of
Golar Nor and end expects soon to enter talks with minority creditors.

FT  29 JUN 93 / International Company News: Expedient exit from an awkward
situation - Plans to allow Italian banks to take stakes in industrial
concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Italy's proposal to let banks take stakes in industry looks
ominously like a case of expediency over invention. The growing crisis at
Ferruzzi and other heavily indebted companies suggests the authorities may
have no choice but to amend strict rules banning stakes in industrial
concerns.
With many big companies in difficulties in the recession, the banks are
facing a collective debt crisis. The borrowings of the 10 biggest companies
either in voluntary liquidation or in talks with their bankers total more
than L50,000bn (Dollars 32.5bn). 'Italy's banks have painted themselves into
a corner and they need to find a way out,' says one analyst.
The exit was proposed last month by none other than the Bank of Italy. It
has suggested letting banks take up to 15 per cent of industrial companies.
The proposal, marking one of the biggest changes to the landmark 1936
banking law, has won cabinet approval and looks set to become law.
'Allowing Italian banks take stakes in industry is like letting the
pyromaniacs into the match factory. Their track record on lending is so
appalling that I dread the consequences,' says one observer.
Mr Antonio Fazio, the new central bank governor, sees things differently.
The change has been presented as a step towards new European Community
banking rules and the German universal banking model.
Supporters say the German system has stimulated growth by giving companies
access to long-term capital. It has helped to isolate the corporate sector
from economic instability by giving companies well-informed core investors
more interested in long-term development than short-term profits. They hope
the reform will transfer the German experience to Italy.
Many banking analysts are more cynical about the reasons for the reform.
Italian banks are facing a unprecedented crisis as soaring credit growth in
the 1980s has left many companies in difficulty servicing their debts today.
Lending accelerated even faster after 1990, when the Bank of Italy removed
its credits ceilings. The increase was boosted by competition in the
fragmented banking sector. In the booming 1980s, industrialists could easily
play off one bank against another to obtain bigger loans or tighter spreads.
Ferruzzi, which borrowed more than L30,000bn, is the largest of a string of
big companies in crisis as a result. Others include the Aga Khan's Ciga
hotels chain, which has stopped paying interest on borrowings of more than
L1,000bn, Arvedi (steel) and Cameli (shipping and industry). The usual
remedy would be a rescheduling, with repayments pushed back to give
borrowers more time. But in many present cases, the ratio of companies'
debts to earnings is so high that even medium-term recovery prospects look
slim.
With little hope of quick repayment, changing the rules to allow the banks
to swap some of their debts for equity is the obvious expedient. Borrowers
pay less interest, while lenders can offset the loss of income against hopes
of a potential windfall when they sell their shares once the companies
return to health. Some of the biggest industrial stakes held by German banks
stem from rescue packages.
Easing Italy's troubled privatisation programme is the other reason for the
reform. Recession has hampered disposals by cutting profits at many of the
companies for sale, making them less attractive. And potential purchasers,
suffering lower earnings themselves, have become more wary of big
acquisitions.
Flotations, the alternative to takeovers, are restricted by the limited
liquidity of the Milan bourse. The government's room for manoeuvre is
further restricted by the dangers of giving private investors too big an
incentive to buy privatisation shares. The risk is that savings may be
diverted away from short-term government bonds, bought mainly by private
investors, which are the main instrument to fund the huge budget deficit.
Allowing big banks to take stakes in newly-privatised companies promises to
ease disposals and avoid embarrassing flops. Banks could be temporary
shareholders pending an economic upturn, when investor demand and rising
stock prices would allow them to sell the shares to longer-term investors.
But the Bank of Italy's plan has already led to a chorus of criticism. The
main objection has been the role of the banks, dominated by the public
sector, in privatisation. 'Rather than privatising, Italy will just be
re-nationalising its public-sector companies by selling stakes to
state-owned banks,' says one critic.
Allowing state-controlled banks to take stakes in privatised companies could
also be counter-productive. A number of big banks are also on the
privatisation list. Lumbering them with unattractive holdings in
newly-privatised industrial companies would compromise their own sale
prospects.
Opponents also point to the banks' poor record on lending, which hardly
recommends them as future investors in industry. Significantly, bank shares
fell after the reform was announced.
However, looming problems with bad debts to industry and the banks' need to
improve their capital ratios suggests they may not be in a position to take
up the new opportunities, even when offered.
Although debt-for-equity deals look increasingly likely for severe cases,
such as Ferruzzi, the number of banks volunteering to buy industrial
holdings looks slim. Many are chasing new capital to lift their ratios after
the lending boom and are unwilling to plough money into equity stakes.
Banks could finance new positions by selling some of their bond portfolios.
But that, too, is unlikely as bond yields are much higher than those on
share dividends, meaning that banks' profits would be reduced.

operations

PACIFIC DUNLOP, the diversified Australian industrial group, has acquired
the Australian and New Zealand operations of Plumrose, the foods company,
from Denmark's East Asiatic Company (EAC) for ADollars 225m (USDollars
151m).
EAC also announced that the planned sale of its Plumrose companies in the UK
and the US to the Danish slaughterhouse group, Vestjyske Slagterier (VJS),
would proceed.
VJS and EAC are also co-operating in the development of the Plumrose
operationsin Germany with a view to a future sale to VJS.
EAC publishes no separate sales and profits figures for the Australian and
New Zealand groups, but the performance in 1992 was said in the group's
annual report to be 'very satisfactory'.
The sale of the Plumrose operations, as well as the disposal earlier this
year of the EAC container shipping line to the Danish AP Moller group, will
help strengthen the group's finances.
In 1992, the group made a loss of DKr1.18bn (Dollars 180m). Equity capital
fell to DKr2.55bn from Dkr3.82bn on assets which were down to DKr14.66bn
from DKr15.70bn.

FT  29 JUN 93 / International Company News: Montedison's L1,679bn loss stuns
investors
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MONTEDISON, the Italian chemicals group controlled by the troubled Ferruzzi
Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company, yesterday stunned shareholders by
announcing that group losses for 1992 were L1,679bn (Dollars 1.1bn).
Last night, Ferfin announced a revised group loss of L1,667bn for 1992,
compared with the previously-disclosed L1,519bn deficit.
The rise from Montedison's previously-announced L1,244bn loss was caused by
a newly-discovered L320bn loss at a little-known subsidiary, Financing and
Investments NV, controlled by the group's Montedison International Holding
subsidiary. Mr Carlo Sama, the outgoing managing director, told the annual
meeting it was not clear when, where or how the loss had been incurred, nor
how big the final liability would be. He implied the loss, which had only
just been discovered, went back some time. Price Waterhouse, Montedison's
accountants, are continuing investigations.
The company was unable to explain why the mysterious additional loss had
resulted in different adjustments to parent company and group results. While
parent company losses were revised upwards by L320bn to L724bn, group losses
were raised by L435bn.
The difference triggered speculation that other parts of Montedison might
have been involved and the parent company figure excluded minority
interests.
Montedison's revised accounts also included a new L500m provision in
connection with allegations against Mr Giuseppe Garofano, a former Ferruzzi
and Montedison executive, in Italy's political corruption scandal. Mr
Garofano disappeared earlier this year after magistrates called on him to
explain a L250m donation to the Christian Democrat party. He claimed the
money had been a personal contribution.
Mr Sama said that although group operating earnings had improved, Montedison
lost L655.9bn at parent company level in the first five months.
Shareholders approved the appointment of a new, smaller board, with Mr Guido
Rossi as chairman and Mr Enrico Bondi as managing director. As expected, Mr
Arturo Ferruzzi, son of the late Mr Serafino Ferruzzi, the group's founder,
stepped down as chairman.
The new board reflected the wishes of the five Italian creditor banks which
have taken effective control of the Ferruzzi empire. The Ferruzzi family
retains some representation on the board, reduced to five from 22 members.
Mrs Alessandra Ferruzzi, youngest of the founder's three daughters and wife
of Mr Sama, has a seat, as does Mr Ariberto Mignoli, the Ferruzzis' lawyer.
Mr Sama is stepping down as deputy chairman and managing director.
Shares in Ferfin and Montedison were suspended yesterday pending the
announcement of the revised losses.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH A significant contribution from the Walport acquisitions in the second
half, Novo Group turned in Pounds 1.8m pre-tax for the year to March 31,
compared with Pounds 728,000 adjusted for FRS 3.
Novo provides storage and logistic services to the visual entertainment
industry. Walport is regarded as the world leader in the distribution of
rented video products to the merchant marine industry, and had begun to
penetrate the airline market.
Turnover rose to Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 12.8m) and operating profit to Pounds
2.31m (Pounds 1.69m) of which Walport contributed Pounds 480,000.
Net interest charges were cut to Pounds 401,000 (Pounds 612,000). Earnings
per share, after a sharply higher tax charge and on increased capital under
the rights issue, were 3.82p (2.95p).
The proposed final dividend is 1p for a total of 1.3p (nil).
Trading in the current year was in line with budget, said Mr Michael
Woolley, chief executive. There were particularly good performances from
some divisions. Although prices remained under pressure, margins had been
maintained through controlling costs and overheads.
Mr Elie Housman is giving up the chairmanship and Mr Richard Wevill will
take over immediately. M Serge Desvignes comes in as a non-executive
director; he is managing director of Com2i, a French investment fund holding
5 per cent of Novo.

FT  29 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Wellcome boost for global ambitions -
Robert Fleming's plans for investment banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN A medium sized, low-key merchant bank says it wants to become a
world-class operator in investment banking, it raises eyebrows.
There is no shortage of British talent in that arena and both the US and
continental Europe offer their fair share of competitors as well.
But Mr John Manser, chief executive of Robert Fleming, argued that the group
had earned a place on the world stage since its role last year as global
co-ordinator of the Dollars 4.5bn (Pounds 3bn) offering of Wellcome shares
on behalf of Wellcome Trust.
'We showed when we did the Wellcome flotation what we were capable of,' Mr
Manser said.
Since the Wellcome deal a year ago, Fleming, known mostly in its capacity as
an asset management house and as a blue-chip adviser on merchant banking
matters, said its profile in investment banking had been rising.
Mr Manser said the company was now being asked to participate in so-called
beauty parades for state privatisation activities, including that of the
government's third stake in British Telecommunications.
'But no one at this time would say we are a leading corporate finance
house,' he acknowledged.
He added that the firm's chief priority was its own profitability. The
results for the 12 months to March 31 1993 made it the second most
profitable UK merchant bank with pre-tax profits of Pounds 101m, trailing
only SG Warburg.
The company did not provide details about the exact source of the profits
except to say generally that asset management, merchant banking and
corporate finance contributed.
Meanwhile, some of Fleming's competitors suggested that its desire to be
world-class in corporate finance might conflict with its aim of maintaining
profitability.
Mr Manser became coy when asked just how profitable the Wellcome advisory
role was, for instance, and would only say that it earned money.
Mr Bill Harrison, recently recruited from Lehman Brothers International to
be chief executive of investment banking, said: 'Profitability is very
important but on the other hand, we are building a business.' However,
Fleming had ruled out pursuing the sort of 'loss leader' business which
other firms had sought in breaking into the corporate finance arena.
He added that the business was likely to be the recipient of the greatest
increase in Fleming resources internally. The division had seen a 10 per
cent expansion in staff in the past year.
In building a corporate finance franchise, Mr Harrison cited the firm's
strengths in Asia where its Jardine Fleming joint venture had a commanding
market share in several sectors.
Among the recent deals driven by its Asian connections were the arrangement
for the purchase of about 100m shares in Trafalgar House by Hong Kong Land
and the subsequent Pounds 200m rights offer by Trafalgar House itself.
While assets under management worldwide had increased smartly in the past
year, Mr Manser acknowledged that Fleming Asset Management, the UK-based arm
of the firm, had had a tough time after several years of mediocre
performance in its UK balanced pension fund pools.
However, the firm was still winning mandates for specialist equity fund
management, he said, and it had taken steps to improve performance for
pooled accounts, the staple product of the UK pension fund industry.
'We have been successful in every category except UK pension funds,' Mr
Manser said. 'But to be absolutely big is not something we see as absolutely
important.'

FT  29 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Jones &amp; Shipman considers cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JONES &amp; SHIPMAN, the Leicester-based machine tool builder, said yesterday it
was in discussions with a trade investor and other financial institutions on
a possible issue of new equity for cash.
Shares in J&amp;S, one of the UK's three publicly-quoted machine tool builders,
rose 1p to 32p after the announcement, valuing the company at about Pounds
3.8m.
Because of the discussions, publication of results for the year to March 31,
due tomorrow is not expected until September.
J&amp;S said the aim of the issue would be to finance completion of the
previously announced rationalisation programme and to increase working
capital.
The programme, which involves halving the workforce to about 250 and
outsourcing the machining of components, was announced last July.
J&amp;S had originally hoped to finance the rationalisation out of existing
resources, but said yesterday it had been impeded by market conditions and
other factors, including its inability to sell property as advantageously as
had been expected.
The company said the precise amount of the issue had yet to be fixed, but
was likely to be 'reasonably substantial'.
The discussions include Close Brothers, the company's merchant banker,
Albert E Sharp, its broker, and institutional shareholders.
J&amp;S said trading conditions in the second half of last year remained
difficult, albeit better than in the first half.
In spite of these difficulties, the trading loss for 1992-93 was said to be
'much reduced' compared with the previous Pounds 3.04m deficit on turnover
of Pounds 15.9m.

FT  29 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Northern Elect lifts dividend by 15.6%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Electric set a new high in dividend increases for the regional
electricity companies yesterday by raising its pay-out by 15.6 per cent,
though it balanced this by announcing a Pounds 10 rebate for its domestic
customers.
The rise at the Newcastle-based utility came on the back of a 13.4 per cent
growth in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 98.2m to Pounds 111.4m, for the year
ended March 31.
Mr David Morris, chairman, said: 'Our excellent results reflect the success
of our post-flotation business strategy, demonstrating consistency and
performance.' He said the dividend increase to 21.45p (18.55p), with a final
of 15.15p, was 'consistent with our underlying financial performance.'
The increase in profits, which fed through to a rise of 16.3 per cent to
69.3p (59.6p) in earnings per share, reflected the resilience of the
north-east, according to Mr Morris. The electricity distribution business,
particularly to domestic and commercial customers, contributed an operating
profit of Pounds 102.9m (Pounds 90.8m). The Pounds 10 rebate will bring the
total price reductions given to domestic customers to close on 7 per cent
this year.
Sales volume in the supply business rose by 16 per cent, but operating
profit remained low at Pounds 3.7m (Pounds 4.1m) because of the tight
margins. But Northern aims to develop this side of the business as it opens
the way to the unregulated market for large customers where much future
growth will come. Northern already supplies 400 large customers outside its
home market.
Its other unregulated businesses traded at an overall profit during the
period, though appliance retailing suffered from a difficult market and only
made a small return, not including restructuring costs.
Profits were also helped by further cost reductions of 3 per cent, including
a 9 per cent reduction in staff numbers. Gearing was reduced to 9 per cent.
COMMENT
The dividend increase sent a flurry of excitement through the sector,
helping Northern's shares to gain 6p to 514p. The strength of the underlying
result, for example on cost reductions, also helped dispel Northern's image
as one of the less well-managed RECs. If there is a worry, it is Northern's
active pursuit of the high risk supply market where small mistakes can be
extremely costly. But management took some trouble to say that it was
strongly hedged against unwelcome price movements. Dividend cover is strong
at over three times. BZW has Northern on a prospective yield of 6 per cent,
assuming a dividend increase of 14.5 per cent next year, which is close to
the sector average.

FT  29 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Universal electronic accountant - The
growing fortunes and share price of QSP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOTS the Chemist, Nottingham-based and laced with Midlands' caution, is in
the early stages of installing accounting software from Quality Software
Products.
QSP, based in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, came to the market in March at 380p.
The shares are now priced at 587p.
The jump indicates the faith the City has in the company's products, and in
particular in its new accounting software designed for the tomorrow's
computing world of clients and servers, for which read computer networks.
Boots, however, with millions of transactions a day to track, is not
installing the wonderproduct Universal On Line Accounting System (Universal
Olas). It is taking Olas, its well-proven predecessor, which runs on IBM
mainframe computers.
'Boots will move to Universal Olas only when it is tried and tested' said Mr
Philip Matthews, Boots' director of finance.
The innate conservatism of finance directors faced with deciding whether to
trust their company's business data to an innovative computer system may be
the greatest obstacle QSP has to overcome in establishing Universal Olas as
a important contender in the accounting systems market.
Universal Olas is important because it can run on any hardware opening up
the prospect of greatly increased sales.
Last week it cleared the first barrier, selling the Universal Olas general
ledger module to a Swiss Bank's London subsidiary for a six figure sum.
Conversion work to move it to the bank's choice of hardware and database is
expected to take 12 weeks.
Here is the wonder of Universal Olas. Written for IBM workstations and the
Oracle database, it is being converted to Sun workstations and the Sybase
database in a matter of weeks. Mr Al-Noor Ramji, Swiss Bank's head of
technology said: 'It is looking good. If QSP meets all the dates it
promised, I'll say nice things.'
Much will depend on the consistency with which QSP can roll out the rest of
the modules to complete the accounting suite. Software to process accounts
payable and accounts receivable is due in the fourth quarter of the year and
Mr Mordain was confident it would be on time: 'There have been no hitches
and it gets easier as we go on.'
That a UK company should be in contention to supply large scale packaged
accounting software to blue chip customers is, in itself, remarkable. In
earlier years companies either wrote their own software or used packages
from US software suppliers like MSA or McCormack &amp; Dodge. Today, these
software houses are no more, absorbed into Dun &amp; Bradstreet Software.
Meanwhile companies like QSP, which had developed accounting packages
operating on-line rather than batch mode and providing management
information in addition to juggling the numbers, were beginning to thrive.
Olas was chosen, for example, by Pearl Assurance, for its new headquarters
and data centre in Peterborough. Mr Tony Richards, the general manager for
finance, found when he arrived in 1991 an organisation starved of
information.
The company was using a standard US-developed accounting package. It was
taking the computer output and employing armies of accountants to rejig the
information manually.
The Olas system was installed on the same IBM mainframe computer as the
software it was replacing and went live after six weeks of parallel
operation. Mr Richards said: 'A number of organisations, including Boots,
have come to see what we have achieved and been impressed'.
Despite the regard in which Olas is held, QSP has its critics. One is Mr
Richard Holway, author of the Holway Report which each year analyses the
financial performance of the UK's computing services companies.
He is concerned that almost alone among UK software houses, QSP capitalises
its research and development costs. 'The latest accounts show a net book
value of Pounds 7.1m. You should be aware that this is Pounds 3m greater
than the total profits (Pounds 4.2m) earned by QSP over the past four
years.'
He is also concerned about the apparent slow down in sales of ordinary Olas
in the past year.
Some analysts, in addition, are becoming concerned that QSP's share price
may be inflated. It has been boosted by a new enthusiasm for high technology
stocks including Microfocus, the UK's most successful software products
company now trading at Pounds 21.53 and Tadpole Technology, a hardware
maker, which came to the market at 65p and is now trading at 323p.
Mr Mordain agreed the market was taking an enthusiastic view of the shares
in advance of the profits the company expected to make in 1994.
'1993 will not be our year. We are still completing development of the new
products. 1994 will be when it all happens, when we will not be poised
between old and new software.'
Analysts are looking for up to Pounds 3.5m in pre-tax profits in 1994. A
share price of about 520p might more realistically balance the risk with the
potential.

FT  29 JUN 93 / UK Company News: European Motor back in black with Pounds
3.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN MOTOR Holdings, the fast-growing motor group which has been
transformed by Mr Richard Palmer, the former Western Motors managing
director, returned to profit last year largely reflecting recent
acquisitions.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.4m in the year to March 31 included a Pounds
2.6m contribution from Wilcomatic, the leading UK supplier of automated
vehicle washing machines which was acquired for Pounds 18.4m in May last
year, and Pounds 1m from the Mill Garages motor dealership group which was
acquired for Pounds 2.7m in July 1992.
The pre-tax result came on turnover of Pounds 117.1m and compared with a
Pounds 1.5m deficit on sales of Pounds 23.9m for the previous 12 months.
Operating profits of Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 600,000 loss) from continuing
operations included Pounds 2.9m (Pounds 300,000) from the motor retail
division of which Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 300,000) was generated by existing
motor dealerships with the remaining Pounds 1.4m coming from dealership
acquisitions.
Losses on the discontinued Cargo Control Equipment business were partly
offset by receipts from the settlement of claims against KPMG Peat Marwick
related to businesses acquired and disposed of in earlier years. KPMG denied
liability.
Net interest costs grew to Pounds 700,000 (Pounds 500,000) reflecting a
slight increase in year-end net borrowings to Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 5.1m),
equivalent to gearing of 34 per cent.
Commenting on the results Mr Palmer, chief executive, said substantial
progress had been made during the year to improve financial performance and
consolidate the acquisitions.
He added: 'We expect to continue to improve the levels of profitability
within our existing businesses and to expand through organic growth, better
utilisation of resources and by acquisition.'
Earnings of 7.3p compared with previous losses of 17.6p. Dividends were
resumed at the interim stage and a final of 2p makes a 3.5p total.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH ALL divisions sufferering from weak demand, profits of Hewetson, which
serves the construction industry, fell by 32 per cent to Pounds 503,000
pre-tax for the year to end-March. The total dividend is cut from 2.6p to
1.25p.
Turnover of continuing operations dropped from Pounds 32.4m to Pounds 28.6m
and operating profits by 33 per cent to Pounds 783,000 as a result of
general pressure on prices and rent increases.
Earnings worked through at 1.36p (2.99p) and there is a final dividend of
0.75p.
Directors said that with low gearing - down from 48 per cent to 18 per cent
 -and a low cost base Hewetson was 'now firmly placed to grow organically
and to benefit from any opportunities that an improved economy may provide.'
Thomas Lowe Joinery, a manufacturer of staircases and other joinery
products, has been acquired from Tarmac for a maximum Pounds 110,000.

Pounds 713,000 pre-tax for the year to March 31, against Pounds 405,000.
The improvement was achieved substantially through restructuring. Several
business disposals and acquisitions have been made, providing a clearer
strategic focus.
Mr Rob Campbell, chief executive, said the group was well structured for
further progress. However, 'we are not experiencing any improvement in
demand in the markets in which we operate'.
Activities of the group cover stationery, housewares, cabinet furniture, and
paper recycling.
Sales in 1992-93 fell to Pounds 15.1m (Pounds 17.1m) because of discontinued
activities.
Mr Campbell said stationery had an excellent year following the integration
of Ivy into the Royston factory. Housewares benefited from the Coffee
Connections acquisition last September, but low demand made it a poor year
for furniture and substantial cost cutting took place.
Earnings per share were 2.88p (1.98p) and the final dividend is 0.25p for a
total of 0.5p (nil).

FT  29 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Alba bucks recessionary trends with sharp
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALBA continued to buck recessionary trends in the year to March 31. Pre-tax
profits rose 15 per cent from Pounds 5.06m to Pounds 5.84m, though the
audio, television and domestic appliances group pointed out that under FRS 3
accounting standards, the pre-tax increase was 62 per cent to Pounds 5.05m.
Mr John Harris, chairman, said that, in the white and brown goods sector,
the recession had started not as late as 1990 but in 1988. He ascribed the
group's success since then to having 'the right recipe'. 'We know what our
customers really want and at what price point they want it.'
The group's products are sold under three brand-names - Alba, Bush and
Hinari - and frequently by mail order. Mr Harris said that Alba Radio, which
mainly sells audio equipment, had market leadership in major audio (audio
systems which plug into the mains) in both quantity of goods sold and in
value. It also has leadership in 14-inch televisions.
Bush makes slightly more upmarket and larger televisions which Mr Harris
expected to show a sharper sales upturn, now that 'the recovery is in
place'. He added that, in general, the rise in television sales was pleasing
in a year with no sales-boosting events like the Olympics or the World Cup.
Hinari Domestic makes the UK's best-selling toaster and is the fifth largest
seller of microwave ovens, 'ahead of some multi-nationals'.
Group turnover totalled Pounds 113.4m (Pounds 111m), with continuing
operations yielding Pounds 110.2m (Pounds 104.7m). Interest payable fell
sharply to Pounds 467,000 (Pounds 1.15m), because of lower rates and the
reduction of borrowings to Pounds 9.1m (Pounds 11.6m) excluding leases.
The dividend is lifted to 4.85p (4.75p) for the year with a 3.85p (3.75p)
final. Under FRS 3, earnings per share were more than doubled at 8.32p
(3.36p) - otherwise they were up 23 per cent to 9.55p (7.79p).

FT  29 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Airtours loss at Pounds 16m after abortive
bid costs hit Pounds 9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRTOURS, the acquisitive holiday company, yesterday announced a first-half
pre-tax loss of Pounds 15.9m, including Pounds 8.99m spent on the failed bid
for its rival Owners Abroad.
The comparative deficit was Pounds 5.6m.
The results for the six months ended March 31 1993 also included a Pounds
2.2m loss from Pickfords Travel, the travel agency chain purchased last
year.
Travel companies are usually in the red in the first half because they have
already begun to pay some of their summer season costs.
Costs of the Owners Abroad bid, which were slightly below expectations,
included a Pounds 3.9m loss on the Owners Abroad shares incurred during the
attempted takeover.
The other Pounds 5.1m consisted of underwriting commissions and professional
fees.
Turnover increased 45 per cent to Pounds 147.3m.
Losses per share came to 15.27p (4.29p) but the interim dividend is raised
to 1p (0.55p).
Mr David Crossland, chairman, said he stood by his forecast made during the
Owners bid that the dividend for the full year would be lifted by not less
than 20 per cent.
He said that Airtours summer 1993 bookings were up 23 per cent in a market
which was growing overall by 6 per cent.
COMMENT
However disappointed Airtours might have been in failing to capture Owners
earlier this year, it has come out ahead in market share. Owners has always
said it was more interested in profit than market share. Nevertheless, it
must be galling to see Mr Crossland claim second place to Thomson with 15.2
per cent of 1993 summer business, compared with 13.8 per cent for Owners. Mr
Crossland needs to show progress in integrating Pickfords, Hogg Robinson and
Aspro before he makes further acquisitions, although he has not lost
interest in continental Europe. Expected profits of Pounds 45m, before the
cost of the bid, and earnings of 30p put the shares on a multiple of 11.
Given that Mr Crossland claims a pre-tax profit per passenger of Pounds
21.60 on the tour operating side, compared with Pounds 12-Pounds 13 for
Thomson and Owners, that might look mean. But few can forget how volatile
the travel business has been in the past, and it will take several seasons
of stability to change that. There is also the additional cloud of the OFT
inquiry. If Airtours still looks in such fine shape when that passes, its
attractions might become more obvious.

FT  29 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Widney shares suspended for purchase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Widney, the maker of windows and water treatment, power
transmission and electronic equipment, were suspended at 7p yesterday after
it announced it was making an acquisition.
At the same time it reported increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 417,000 for
the six months to April 3, against Pounds 155,000 restated for FRS 3.
Turnover was Pounds 9.88m (Pounds 9.69m). Losses per share were 0.91p
(0.43p).
The consideration involves an initial payment of Pounds 3.2m satisfied by
shares and a further profit-related payment to a maximum Pounds 800,000.
The vendors are placing shares worth Pounds 1.76m and Widney is raising a
further Pounds 3.8m in a placing to cover acquisition costs and for working
capital. Both are subject to open offers to existing shareholders.
After the purchase, the company intends seeking approval for cancelling part
of the share premium account equal to the debit balance on the profit and
loss account allowing proposals for clearance of the arrears of the
preference dividends.

FT  29 JUN 93 / UK Company News: GPT gets payphone boost from Venezuela
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPT, the UK telecom-munications manufacturing subsidiary of GEC and Siemens,
has won a Pounds 9m payphones contract from Venezuela, taking payphone
orders from Latin America to more than Pounds 30m in the past year.
Latin America, a rapidly growing market for GPT's payphones division, is
expected to help lift the division's sales from Pounds 82m last year to more
than Pounds 90m this year.
With the latest order GPT will have supplied more than 80,000 phones to the
continent.
The Venezuela contract, awarded by the country's privatised telephone
company against strong competition from Japanese suppliers, is for
additional payphones - card and multi-payment variants - together with a
national cashless calling systems and the expansion of the existing payphone
management system.
It follows a Pounds 12.5m contract won last October, as part of Venezuela's
programme of upgrading its public phone network.
GPT manufactures its new generation of 'intelligent' payphones, which accept
credit cards and smart cards with microcomputers embedded within them, at
its plant in Chorley, Lancashire.
GPT now supplies payphones and associated management systems to 60
countries.

FT  29 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Securiguard climbs to Pounds 3.53m -
Rentokil offer 'completely fails to recognise' future prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECURIGUARD, the security and cleaning company facing a hostile Pounds 59.2m
bid from Rentokil, yesterday announced sharply higher interim profits and
said the offer price of 270p a share 'completely fails to recognise' its
future prospects.
Pre-tax profits grew 36 per cent, from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 3.53m, in the
six months to May 16, slightly ahead of expectations. The company made no
full-year profit forecast, but said it intended to recommend a 22 per cent
rise in total dividends for the year.
The shares, which have traded above the offer price since the bid was
launched last month, yesterday closed unchanged at 309p. Rentokil, which
wants to add Securiguard's guarding and cleaning activities to its own
business services, has until midnight next Tuesday to decide whether to
raise or declare its bid final.
Mr Alan Baldwin, chairman of Securiguard, said he last week received a
second letter from Rentokil offering talks. 'But there's nothing to discuss.
I think Rentokil has got to rethink. (The offer) is way, way away from where
it should be,' he said.
Rentokil said the company would look at the interim figures in detail before
deciding its next move.
Securiguard's profits were lifted by a higher than expected contribution
from its communications division, which mainly involves the City Link parcel
delivery service. Trading profits more than doubled to Pounds 1.03m even
though turnover was only 17 per cent higher.
Mr Baldwin said the division was helped by volume increases and previous
investment. He said profits growth was 'very sustainable'.
Group turnover increased 8 per cent to Pounds 95.8m while trading profit
increased 20 per cent to Pounds 4.08m. Net borrowings remained stable at
'about Pounds 10m', according to Mr Baldwin, while interest costs fell
slightly to Pounds 549,000 (Pounds 792,000).
The security division increased trading profits 12 per cent to Pounds 1.84m.
New contracts were won worth Pounds 6.5m a year and the company said it was
soon to start work on its first German contract.
The personnel division, which has been hit by losses at its HeMan
construction services subsidiary, incurred losses of Pounds 426,000 (Pounds
511,000). Mr Baldwin said HeMan's markets had improved, but it was too early
to say if the division would break even this year.
Earnings increased 36 per cent to 11.7p (8.6p). The interim dividend is
increased from 3.5p to 4.5p. Securiguard said it intended to recommend full
year dividends of 'at least' 11.5p - a 22 per cent increase.

FT  29 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Berkeley beats housing rivals with 25%
increase to Pounds 15.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERKELEY GROUP, the Surrey-based housebuilder, underscored its ability to
outperform its rivals yesterday when it reported a 25 per cent increase in
profits.
The pre-tax line jumped to Pounds 15.8m in the year to April 30 compared
with Pounds 12.6m last time - comfortably ahead of the Pounds 15m minimum
forecast at the time of the 1-for-4 rights issue which raised Pounds 44.1m
in March.
Turnover rose 44 per cent to Pounds 182m (Pounds 126m), mainly reflecting
the 1,226 units sold last year as against 858 in the preceding period.
Earnings per share increased to 16p from an adjusted 13.1p and the group
plans to pay an increased final dividend of 4.35p (3.5p), making a total of
6p (5p).
Mr Tony Pidgley, chief executive, emphasised that the results were achieved
despite the extremely volatile domestic housing market, particularly in the
wake of the UK's withdrawal from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in
September when prices fell sharply again and margins were under intense
pressure.
Mr Graham Roper, chairman, said the slight strengthening in the market in
the new year had little beneficial effect on sales prices, but did help the
group meet its targets in terms of sales volumes and unit numbers.
Operating profits increased to Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 11.2m) including a
Pounds 4.5m full year contribution from St George, a joint venture between
Berkeley and Speyhawk until Speyhawk sold its 50 per cent stake to Berkeley
in September 1991. St George builds mainly lower priced social housing in
London.
Net interest receipts totalled Pounds 359,000 compared to net interest costs
of Pounds 733,000 in the previous year.
At the end of April the group had net cash of Pounds 3.8m excluding the
rights issue proceeds, compared with net borrowings of Pounds 2.5m.
Berkeley has also been steadily increasing its investment in commercial
property at a time when prices have been at basement levels. Berkeley
Eastoak Investments, its joint venture with Saad Investments of the Middle
East, has so far spent almost Pounds 120m building up its portfolio and aims
to invest a total of Pounds 200m.
COMMENT
Tony Pidgley has consistently managed to stay one jump ahead of the property
market. The decision in 1989 to liquidate land holdings and work in progress
has paid off handsomely. It has enabled the group to follow a buy-build
policy throughout the recession and to acquire quality land at reasonable
prices. Currently the group has 'control' over 5,000 plots, including 3,000
with detailed planning permission, and expects to increase the number of
houses built this year by about 25 per cent. Pre-tax profits this year could
reach Pounds 25m, producing earnings of 21.8p and a prospective p/e of 18.5.
At 404p the stock is not a bargain but the group deserves its high rating.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Northern Telecom shares fall 20%
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NORTHERN Telecom's shares lost about a fifth of their value on the New York
and Toronto stock exchanges yesterday after the surprise announcement that
the Canadian telephone equipment maker expects to post a second-quarter
loss.
The shares of Northern's parent company, BCE of Montreal, were also hit.
The announcement, made after North American markets closed on Friday,
included a prediction of 'significantly' lower earnings for 1993.
Northern's share price fell CDollars 10.25 to close at CDollars 37.13 in
Toronto. BCE, which owns 53 per cent of Northern, fell CDollars 1.50 to
close at CDollars 44.
Northern said that it had been hit by lower-than-expected sales of public
switches in Europe and North America, and a squeeze on margins. The
computerised switches are among its most profitable products.
Analysts said yesterday that Northern appeared to be the victim of changing
spending patterns among North America's regional telephone companies.
Although overall capital spending had remained roughly unchanged, the
emphasis had shifted from switching equipment - Northern's strength - to
transmission products and cellular technology, where its exposure was
relatively small. 'Their product mix isn't quite right,' said Mr George
Podrasky, analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago.
Northern also announced the replacement of its chairman, Dr Paul Stern, by
Mr Bradford Butler, a former chairman of Procter &amp; Gamble, and a
long-serving Northern director.
Dr Stern, who stepped aside as chief executive earlier this year, has been
given credit for expanding Northern's international business, but criticised
for neglecting customer service, especially of the regional phone companies.
Analysts yesterday cut their 1993 earnings estimates to between USDollars 1
and Dollars 1.50 a share, from the Dollars 2.20 per share previously
expected.
Earnings in 1992 were Dollars 2.17 a share. Northern's second-quarter
earnings last year were USDollars 72.3m (Pounds 48.5m).

FT  29 JUN 93 / Brent Walker breaches agreement with bankers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRENT WALKER, the property, pubs and betting shop group, has breached and
will continue to breach some of the terms of the refinancing which it agreed
with its bankers in March last year. It is now finalising a new business
plan to put to lenders, which are owed more than Pounds 1.3bn.
Sir Keith Bright, who took over as chairman in January said it was
'essential that a solution to the company's financial problems be found' so
that the core businesses could expand.
The group, once headed by Mr George Walker, yesterday reported a Pounds
427.4m pre-tax loss for 1992, against a Pounds 407.3m loss in 1991. The 1992
accounts, showing a deficit on net assets of Pounds 557.9m, up from Pounds
455.9m at the end of 1991, have been qualified by the group's auditors on a
going concern basis. Brent Walker is not performing in line with the
business plan written before Mr Walker left the group in May 1991 and
rejigged in October that year.
As well as breaching covenants, Sir Keith said the group's disposal
programme of non-core assets 'has not developed in the way anticipated'. He
blamed weakness in the property market.
Operating profits of Pounds 49.5m, up from Pounds 45.6m, were below the
level agreed in the original plan. Mr John Leach, finance director, said an
earlier end to the UK recession had been envisaged.
The Pubmaster chain of pubs and the William Hill betting shops, the group's
two core businesses, had performed well given the trading background and the
uncertainty surrounding the company.
Interest charges totalled Pounds 204.4m, down from Pounds 235.8m in 1991.
However, only Pounds 65m of interest was paid in cash, with most of the rest
being converted into preference shares.
William Hill, which is ring-fenced from Brent Walker, is still suffering the
burden of interest rates fixed at 17 per cent at the time of its acquisition
for Pounds 685m in 1989. This will end when the William Hill bank syndicate
is refinanced in March 1994.
There were exceptional costs of Pounds 246m, largely relating to further
property write downs, but also Pounds 4.5m of costs for the refinancing. The
pub estate was written down by Pounds 210.1m, following similar reductions
by other pub owners.
Brent Walker said the William Hill properties, in the books at Pounds 701.1m
would be worth 'significantly less' on an open market basis, but no
provision had been made since the directors did not regard this as
permanent.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Creditors back plan for Heron
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERON, the property and trading group led by Mr Gerald Ronson (above), won
the support of creditors for its Pounds 1.4bn debt restructuring plan at a
meeting in London yesterday.
There are two further meetings, in the Netherlands and the Netherlands
Antilles, to consider the proposals, but these are expected to follow the
lead of yesterday's vote.
Of those voting, more than 80 per cent by value, and 75 per cent by number,
accepted the proposals. The minimum required was 75 per cent by value and 50
per cent by number.
Heron is also understood to have concluded the restructuring of its US
assets, another condition for the refinancing to go ahead. The schemes need
ratification by the courts in the three jurisdictions, but completion of the
refinancing is expected by the end of July.
At yesterday's meeting Mr Gerald Ronson said that the group could now see
'signs of improvement in the sectors in which our trading businesses
operate'. More than Pounds 150m of property sales had been completed or
agreed in principle at values above those in the group's business plan.
One financier said after the meeting that the disposals would have been
those properties which were easiest to sell. Later sales would be more
critical. 'It is those difficult sales at the margin which make the
difference between the scheme working or not.'
The meeting proved less heated than many had expected.
About 20 creditors attended and of them only one raised questions from the
floor. That was Mr Simon Shane of First Eastern Developments, a Bermudan
property consultant, who spoke through his legal representative.
Mr Gary Klesch, a bond dealer who claimed to represent 10 per cent of the
group's bondholders and had opposed the proposals, did not attend.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Airtours reacts to OFT inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRTOURS, the holiday company, will suggest to the Office of Fair Trading
that tied travel agency chains be required to display notices alerting
customers that staff will probably recommend the parent tour operator's
holidays.
The OFT wrote to travel companies and trade organisations earlier this month
saying it was conducting informal inquiries into links between large
operators and travel agents. Companies have been asked to make submissions
by July 11.
Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said its submission would say that
customers have a right to know whether a travel agent is owned by a tour
operator.
He added that it would be impractical to prohibit the payment of incentives
and commissions to travel agent counter staff by tour operators. He said
staff at Pickfords Travel, the travel agency chain which the group purchased
last year, were paid a pre-tax commission of Pounds 3 for every Airtours
holiday sold. Staff can build up points towards a holiday as an alternative
to the cash payments.
Mr Crossland said the payment of incentives had been happening for decades
and had nothing to do with the recent trend towards vertical integration in
the industry. He recalled that as a travel agency employee in the early
1960s, he had received a holiday on the Costa Brava.
He did not think the OFT would order tour operators to sell their travel
agency chains as it had approved Airtours' purchase of Pickfords.
Airtours, which yesterday announced a half-year pre-tax loss of Pounds 15.9m
after the Pounds 9m cost of its failed bid for Owners Abroad, has bought
Cardiff-based Aspro Travel, the UK's seventh largest tour operator. The
Pounds 20m acquisition follows the purchase of the Hogg Robinson travel
agency chain earlier this month.
He said the purchase of Aspro would strengthen Airtours in Wales, Northern
Ireland and the south-west of England. Aspro's programmes to the eastern
Mediterranean would complement Airtours' strength in the western
Mediterranean and the Canary Islands.
Airtours would retain the Aspro brand name. Its airline, Inter Auropean
Airways would, however, be integrated into the Airtours flight division and
its eight aircraft repainted in the Airtours livery.
Mr Crossland said the enlarged group would have 18 aircraft operating this
summer. This would be reduced to between 14 and 16 by next summer.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Chips are down in the Japanese market: How computer makers
are coping with rapid change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAPID changes in the computer industry are forcing Japanese manufacturers to
recognise even they cannot make everything on their own.
A growth in cross-border activity - illustrated by Fujitsu's recent decision
to use Siemens Nixdorf technology in some of its mainframes - comes as the
Japanese makers brace themselves for unprecedented change in their domestic
market.
Customers are shifting from powerful, expensive mainframe computers to
networks of personal computers that are smaller and cheaper, but in many
cases just as effective - a trend known in the industry as downsizing.
Downsizing has already forced western computer makers to restructure. But
until recently, Japanese manufacturers could watch with detached sympathy as
western competitors suffered from falls in demand for mainframes.
Japanese PC manufacturers used to keep a tight grip on the domestic market
through their proprietary systems. Prices stayed high because the difficulty
of processing the Japanese language helped to limit outside competition.
The spread of software that overcomes the language barrier and the move to
open systems are eroding this advantage by allowing competition from cheaper
US models.
'During the bubble years of economic expansion, both users and suppliers
said downsizing would never happen in Japan,' says Mr Koichiro Chiwata, an
analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo. PC prices were still very high, nobody
in Japan had much experience of downsizing and there were fears about the
security of switching to PCs and workstations.
Japanese computer makers also knew their customers were locked into
proprietary systems, in which huge sums were invest- ed, making it difficult
to switch to cheaper and open systems.
'Of the top 100 companies in Japan, 98 are Fujitsu's customers. They have
built complicated information and communication systems (on Fujitsu's
mainframes) and this won't be transferred to new systems that quickly,' says
Mr Takashi Sekizawa, president of Fujitsu.
However, the forces of change which swept through the west have begun to
filter into Japan.
In the past year PC prices have fallen dramatically, due to low-priced units
from overseas. 'The period when only mainframes and terminals existed is
over,' admits Mr Sekizawa. 'Customers now have a wide range of choice in
information technology.
'They will be looking to integrate new systems with their existing systems
so mainframes won't disappear in five to 10 years, but their importance will
decrease.'
Fujitsu, which has more than 40 per cent of Japan's high-end and
medium-sized mainframe market, has seen its orders for the large machines
dwindle from 37 per cent of overall orders in 1988 to 26 per cent in 1992.
In the year to March, Fujitsu's revenues from its mainframe operations were
flat. Mr Phua Lee-Kerk, an analyst at Barings Securities, estimates that NEC
and Hitachi saw their mainframe sales shrink by 4 per cent and 14 per cent
respectively.
The sharp downturn in mainframe sales is in part due to the economic
slowdown in Japan, but the outlook beyond the current slump is no less grim:
The industry is unlikely to see renewed investment in advanced information
systems on the scale previously made by financial institutions, says Mr
Shigeru Yoshinaka, at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities in Tokyo.
The Japanese computer industry is no longer as protected as it used to be
from the forces that led users in western markets to shift from large
mainframe computers to PC networks.
The situation is forcing a review of strategy by Japanese manufacturers, who
have poured billions of dollars into the development of mainframes -
traditionally a high margin business.
Japanese companies regard retreat from a business as a sign of defeat.
Nevertheless, the grim prospects have already led Toshiba, Mitsubishi
Electric and Oki to opt out of the mainframe business, leaving four
principal players - Fujitsu, IBM Japan, Hitachi and NEC.
Fujitsu hopes to retain its edge in mainframes by meeting customers' needs
for faster, more reliable and cheaper products. But this may mean mainframes
will not be as profitable, says Mr Tadao Yoshihara, general manager of the
computer systems group at Fujitsu.
Even the strongest players in the mainframe market see the need to shift to
other businesses, particularly software and services - which many have begun
to charge for. The move has caused an uproar: in Japan 'service' means
'free' and customers were used to being provided with services without
charge.
Another area which Fujitsu believes is promising is the servicing of
multi-vendor systems, which are beginning to spread.
Fujitsu wants to increase the proportion of revenue it derives from software
and services from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. It is well placed to benefit
from expanding that side of the business. With IBM Japan, it commands 55 per
cent of the mainframe market.
Their financial strength places them at an advantage over specialist
software and service companies, which do not have the same resources.
'Japanese software houses have sent their staff to customers like temporary
staff,' says Mr Chiwata. 'But this means that the company is left without
any know-how.'
As Mr Yoshihara puts it, the key to survival in the mainframe market is 'to
see the impact of downsizing and create a system that incorporates its
benefits'. The large computer makers which move quickly to take the
initiative are best placed to win in the end.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Accounting change leaves BR over Pounds 100m better off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL is braced for a hostile reaction to an accounting move that
will benefit its profit-and-loss account by more than Pounds 100m when it
publishes its annual results tomorrow.
Critics are likely to claim the figures have been massaged in an effort to
stimulate private sector interest in railway privatisation, due to start
next year.
BR will defend itself by saying the move is a delayed response to a
long-standing government directive requiring its accounts to conform with
normal commercial practice.
The move will boost operating profits by nearly Pounds 90m for InterCity,
one of the most attractive parts of the railway to private-sector train
operators.
In the year to March 1992, InterCity originally reported a profit of just
Pounds 2m. That is now understood to have been restated to show a profit of
Pounds 91m.
In the latest year, ending March 1993, InterCity was expected to have
suffered heavily from recession. Now it is expected to be substantially in
profit.
Overall, BR has been left Pounds 120m better off by the move, reducing last
year's pre-tax losses of Pounds 145m to a loss of just Pounds 25m. In the
year just ended, the effect is expected to reduce losses of Pounds
250m-Pounds 300m to a loss of about Pounds 170m.
BR says the change was ordered by the Department of Transport in December
1989 to give a more accurate picture of business performance, and has taken
until now to introduce.
The main effect is to alter the way BR accounts for infrastructure renewals
such as track replacement or resignalling. Previously, these were counted as
costs in the year in which they were incurred, and were charged to the
profit-and-loss account.
Under the new policy, infrastructure spending will be counted as capital
investment and charged to the balance sheet. The only cost charged against
the profit-and-loss account will be an annual one for depreciation
calculated over the asset's lifetime.
A further boost will come from a change in the treatment of grants for
capital investment. Instead of being written off in the year in which they
are received, they will be released to the profit-and-loss account over the
lifetime of the investment, partly offsetting the depreciation charge.
BR said InterCity was a particularly big beneficiary of the accounting
change because it was the division that had invested most.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Mayhew apologises for remark on grenade blast: Comment on
explosion was 'expression of relief'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, last night apologised
for an apparent gaffe which had threatened fresh embarrassment for prime
minister John Major's increasingly accident-prone administration.
In a letter to Mr Kevin McNamara, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Sir
Patrick said he 'much regretted' any distress caused by his remark about a
grenade explosion in Belfast on Saturday that injured nearly 30 people.
This had been made as 'an expression of relief' that no one had been killed
in the incident, the Northern Ireland secretary said, adding: 'I saw at once
that it could have caused offence.'
Sir Patrick had angered Mr McNamara and Ulster Unionist MPs after joking
that 'nobody was dead' after the explosion during a loyalist parade in the
Shankill area of Belfast.
Mr McNamara later condemned Sir Patrick for making 'flippant and unfeeling'
remarks and wrote demanding an apology. The row followed the decision by the
BBC in Ulster to broadcast a recording of remarks by Sir Patrick made when
visiting the opera in Castleward, county Down, with the prime minister on
Saturday night.
The scene had been planned as a delicate public relations exercise, designed
to demonstrate that there was more to Belfast than bombs or dole queues. Mr
John Major's party had swooped in army helicopters into the elegant grounds
of Castleward to see Donizetti's Lucia Di Lammermoor.
Faced with a barrage of press questions on recent explosions, Mr Major
insisted as he strode across the grass: 'We have only come for the opera. I
have no comment to make.'
Sir Patrick, however, after saying he would not comment until briefed, said:
'Well, nobody is dead yet. At the end of this opera, everybody is dead.'
As the faces of his hovering press officers froze, Sir Patrick quickly added
that it was no joking matter. He went on to express his outrage to the
waiting cameras.
Sir Patrick's aside was seen as insensitive by local politicians - and
highlighted the precarious task faced by Northern Ireland secretaries, who
rarely win a loyal following among the province's politicians.
Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, said Sir
Patrick's remarks had been 'absolutely disgraceful.'
Mr McNamara last night accepted Sir Patrick's expressions of regret, saying:
'He dropped a clanger. He has apologised which is more than most members of
this government do when clangers are dropped. There the matter rests.'

FT  29 JUN 93 / Scottish peat profits bogged down by wet spell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONTHS OF diluvial conditions in the peat bogs of Scotland followed by a
long spell of wretched gardening weather in the suburbs of England caused
shares in a leading maker of potting compost to fall 15 per cent yesterday.
As the sun shone and temperatures soared, Mr Tom Sinclair, chairman of
William Sinclair Holdings, reflected sadly on a combination of events which
obliged the company to issue a profits warning to the stock exchange.
Last summer was so squelchy in the company's peat bogs in Scotland that it
could not cut the usual amount of peat for making into compost.
The reduced harvest would have been just about sufficient, but in February
and March the weather was so wet the company's machines became bogged down
in the mire.
'They've had double the normal rainfall in that part of Scotland in the past
12 months - 55 inches,' Mr Sinclair said.
To meet demand, the company had to buy in peat from other suppliers. But
then came the miserable weather that affected most of Britain in May and
early June which meant gardeners could not get to their flower and vegetable
beds to dig in the annual injection of compost.
'You have to put it in during May and early June,' says Mr Sinclair. 'After
that it's too late. In England and Wales we've had the wettest May for seven
years.'
Sales of J. Arthur Bowers compost, William Sinclair's brand, were sluggish
in the crucial weeks as gardeners deserted the garden centres. Turnover in
the entire British gardening market has been down 8 or 9 per cent this year,
Mr Sinclair says.
William Sinclair does not extract peat from picturesque, environmentally
sensitive areas of the Highlands and Islands but from diggings close to
former coal mines in the prosaic landscapes around Lanark and Falkirk in
central Scotland.
It has not been affected by controversy over the extraction of peat from
sites of special scientific interest which has created difficulties for
Fisons in Yorkshire and aroused the ire of the Prince of Wales.
William Sinclair, based in Lincoln, told the stock exchange yesterday that
because of 'cold and wet weather conditions' affecting its horticultural
division, pre-tax profits for the year to June 30 would be 15 to 20 per cent
below last year's Pounds 4.6m. He said the pet, aquatic and household
products division had shown solid growth and the board intended to maintain
its dividend of 7p per share. William Sinclair's shares fell 36p yesterday
to close at 196p.

FT  29 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Tate &amp; Lyle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tate &amp; Lyle's investment in the Slovak Republic represents a small lump in
its corporate sugarbowl. But the move illustrates how food manufacturers in
mature economies are becoming increasingly reliant on developing markets for
growth. Tate's big presence in Anglo-Saxon markets precludes further
acquisitions in sugar and starch. Eastern Europe and the Pacific Rim are
therefore assuming ever greater importance. The shift of focus inevitably
raises Tate's risk profile, suggesting its earnings stream may be less
highly rated. A forward multiple of 11 already places Tate below the market
average.
The immediate worries are understandable. But European and US food markets
will experience little volume growth in coming years. Western companies
which can successfully exploit developing markets should, if anything,
command a premium rating. Comparatively small investments will bring
disproportionate returns. Not only will they allow companies to service fast
growing domestic demand. If trade is liberalised, low cost plants in
countries such as Hungary or Mexico will be ideally positioned for export
growth. The prizes will go to companies that can successfully manage the
risks in developing markets. Nestle, Coca-Cola and Unilever lead the way.
Tate, which also has to wrestle with what is essentially a commodity
business, still has some way to go to establish its credentials.

FT  29 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese government bond market is caught between political uncertainty
and favourable economic fundamentals. Having retreated since the grip of the
Liberal Democratic Party was called into question, real yields of around 4.4
per cent at the longer maturities are back close to the five-year average.
Yet even on the rose-tinted view of recovery favoured by the authorities,
inflation is unlikely to rise much above the current 1 per cent. Since the
Japanese currency has now resumed its upward march, the chances are that a
strong yen will add to the cyclical pain. That points to the kind of
sluggish recovery in which bonds flourish.
If political deadlock prevents a further fiscal stimulus this year, the Bank
of Japan might respond with another cut in interest rates. That is unlikely
to bring inflationary pressure while domestic demand remains so weak.
As elsewhere, investors may move to longer maturities in search of income as
short-term rates are cut. Given Japan's relatively comfortable government
finances, bond yields could again fall below 4 per cent.
Political reform may even prove favourable in the longer term.
Liberalisation of agricultural markets and greater import penetration
favoured by some of the break-away parties might result in lower consumer
prices, for example. Given the respectable showing of the LDP in Tokyo's
local elections, it would not do to take anything as bold for granted. But
there is nothing in the emerging political chemistry which should spread
gloom across the bond market.

FT  29 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Rentokil/Securiguard
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rentokil's bid for Securiguard has reached the delicate stage following the
latter's interim figures yesterday. Securiguard's 36 per cent rise in
first-half earnings and promise of a 22 per cent dividend increase looks
designed to prise out more cash. Rentokil has to be careful. It cannot
afford to lose its first contested bid, but nor, assuming it will need more
than just bolt-on acquisitions from now on, can it be seen to be a soft
touch.
If the sole criterion was to avoid earnings dilution in the first year,
Rentokil could afford to increase its bid to well over 350p from its initial
270p. But that would smack of desperation and implies a price out of line
with Securiguard's underlying growth prospects. There must be doubts about
the sustainability of the 135 per cent first-half growth in its
communications business. The personnel division is still losing money and
prison services have not made any yet at all.
Rentokil faces an uphill struggle in bringing Securiguard's margins of
between 5 and 6 per cent in cleaning and security closer to its own norm of
around 25 per cent. To generate the requisite growth, the acquisition must
also open the possibility of increased volume. Security, a new activity for
Rentokil, might unlock some opportunities but success is far from certain.
At least the stability of Securiguard's share price suggests yesterday's
figures will not force Rentokil to put a substantial increase on the table.

FT  29 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Thorp's weak glow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
From electricity too cheap to meter to nuclear power stations which fail to
find private buyers, atomic accountancy has a pretty shabby record. So it is
right to greet British Nuclear Fuels' claim that the Thorp reprocessing
plant will be a moneyspinner with scepticism. All the more so since it
refuses to disclose the details of its calculations or contracts.
Accountancy of deferred costs and contingent liabilities is a notoriously
slippery subject - as firms such as British and Commonwealth have found out
to their great cost. Far more information is needed to form a judgment on
Thorp.
BNF's public case for preferring Thorp to the alternative of storing fuel
assumes that the capital costs of the plant are excluded since they are
already spent. Yet even when the capital costs are, in effect, written off,
the government is hardly rushing to apply market tests to the reprocessing
plant.
If Thorp is such a good deal, why are private companies not to be invited to
tender for the project to recoup some of the money already spent? Why are so
many in the electricity industry privately sceptical about Thorp? Why has
Scottish Nuclear opted for dry storage of spent fuel once its existing
contract with BNF expires?
The worry must be that Thorp is not all that BNF cracks it up to be. BNF's
cost-plus contracts are also under threat with Nuclear Electric and Scottish
Nuclear trying to turn existing contracts into fixed-price deals. Other
customers may follow suit. If they do, will the contingent risks lie with
the government or BNF? Until such issues are resolved, there is no case for
starting Thorp. If a suitably robust market solution is not found, there may
never be.

FT  29 JUN 93 / High noon on the high street: Can UK superstores beat off a
sharp challenge from discounters while improving profitability?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At Castle Bromwich in the West Midlands, shoppers face a choice that will
confront increasing numbers of UK consumers in the 1990s. On one side of a
car park is a Safeway superstore, offering almost 20,000 high-quality
products, many at premium prices; on the other is a branch of Aldi, a German
discount retailer, offering 600 of the most popular products at rock-bottom
prices.
The UK's 'big three' food retailers, which stress quality, choice and
convenience more than price, have bounced through the recession with
ever-growing profits. Continuing a 10-year trend, Sainsbury's pre-tax profit
rose 17 per cent to Pounds 733m last year; Argyll, owner of Safeway, was up
9 per cent to Pounds 417m; and Tesco gained 7 per cent to Pounds 581m.
But the strength of their results has led to allegations from MPs and
consumer groups that operators of superstores - large supermarkets of more
than 20,000 square feet - are using their market power to overcharge
consumers and make excessive profits. There are also fears in the City of
London that the superstores' ability to sustain the profits growth of the
past decade could be undermined by the rapid expansion of the price-led
discount retailers.
A study by McKinsey, the management consultancy, warns that UK retailers
risk a sharp decline in profitability unless they use increases in
efficiency to provide lower prices to consumers. It says the UK faces
similar market conditions to those in the US, including increasing price
sensitivity among consumers and competition from discount outlets.
Critics say the benefits of recent efficiency improvements have not been
passed on to consumers. Rather, superstore operators have used these
improvements and the 'screwing down' of prices paid to farmers and other
food producers to double their profit margins in the past decade.
The big three's operating margins - broadly a measure of how many pence they
make on each Pounds 1 customers spend, after subtracting operating costs -
have increased to 7 or 8 per cent, while margins for leading grocers in the
US and continental Europe have been held at 2 or 3 per cent. That, claim the
critics, means the UK's biggest grocers could cut their prices by up to 6p
in the Pounds 1 and still perform as well as their overseas counterparts.
Although Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, rejected a
recent call from Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, for an
investigation of the big supermarkets' pricing policies, profits and
treatment of suppliers, he added that he would keep the matter under review.
But are the allegations of overcharging accurate?
Taking profits as a proportion of sales, there is no doubt that the big UK
retailers make a better return than their continental European rivals, with
operating margins three or four times as high.
UK grocers, however, say they have held their price increases below the
overall rate of inflation over the past decade and have increased operating
margins by improving efficiency and reducing costs.
They point to a series of measures that have improved their performance:
The big grocers have shifted towards trading from large superstores, where
there are greater economies of scale in labour, sales and distribution
costs.
They have reduced rental costs by investing more in freehold, rather than
leasehold, property.
The superstore operators have also increased their sales of high-margin
goods, such as fresh and prepared foods.
They have cut costs by centralising distribution and investing heavily in
technology, such as laser scanners at check-outs linked to computers that
automatically monitor stocks and re-order goods.
'UK food retailing systems are the envy of Europe,' says Mr John Beaumont,
chief executive of the Institute of Grocery Distribution, an industry
research and advisory body.
But what most sets the UK's big three apart from continental European
competitors is the importance they attach to own-label products, which
account for more than 50 per cent of sales by value at Sainsbury, Safeway
and Tesco.
In many UK and overseas chains, own-label has usually meant poor-quality
imitations of branded goods. The top UK grocers have improved the quality of
own-label products so much they can compete directly against proprietary
brands. Because they do not have to bear the same distribution, advertising
and promotion costs as brand manufacturers, retailers can sell own-label
goods at 15 per cent below branded equivalents and still achieve a similar
cash profit, says Mr David Webster, Argyll's deputy chairman.
Own-label is also set to be a powerful weapon in any war against the
discounters. Sainsbury has recently given presentations comparing favourably
the quality and price of its own-label products with manufacturers' branded
products at Kwik Save, the largest discount food chain.
But does this mean the big three are now making bigger operating margins
than they need to and so overcharging customers?
The grocers answer that the high investment needed to expand in the UK
compared with continental Europe means their operating profits have to be
higher if they are to achieve similar returns on their investments.
Taking profits as a proportion of capital employed in the business,
Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway argue their return is not out of line with that
of most continental European grocers.
Some of the higher investment was through choice: the superstores decided to
invest in freehold property and build to a very high standard. However, some
of the higher spending was forced on them by higher land and construction
costs in the UK than in Belgium, France or Germany, for example.
In these conditions, says Mr Roger Ramsden, manager of the consumer and
retail practice at the Boston Consulting Group, the management consultancy,
UK grocers would achieve a lower return on capital than their European
counterparts if they reduced their operating margins. This would discourage
investors from putting money into UK grocers.
'The end result would simply be a less effective food retailing sector,' he
says.
Some industry analysts, however, challenge the grocers' arguments that it is
mainly efficiency that is allowing them to boost operating margins.
Mr Robert Clark, director of Corporate Intelligence, a retail market
research group, believes it is partly because their gross margins - the
difference between the price customers pay for goods and the amount the
goods cost the retailer - are higher than those overseas. Gross margins are
not a subject UK food retailers like to dwell on, and accounting differences
between the UK and continental Europe make it difficult to draw comparisons
from the published accounts.
But Mr Clark says his research shows that UK gross margins average 27 per
cent, outstripping most European food retailers by several percentage
points.
Research is inconclusive on whether UK consumers pay more for their food
than people in continental Europe. Fluctuating exchange rates and the
difficulty of comparing like products with like mean price comparisons
between different countries can be misleading.
However, one reasonably authoritative survey carried out for the Financial
Times in January by Nielsen, the market research company, found UK retail
prices for a range of common European brands were 17 per cent lower than the
average for 14 European countries. UK prices were the cheapest in every
product category except alcoholic drinks, which are heavily taxed in the UK.
But the results of this survey were influenced by the devaluation of
sterling last September.
Superstore operators say their real achievement has been to keep prices
competitive overall, while transforming the eating habits of the nation  -
introducing many products unknown in the UK 10 years ago - and offering
customers unprecedented standards of quality and service.
'We don't have 835 superstores in the UK because of some fantasy on the part
of the retailers that said we ought to have them. People like shopping in
them,' says Mr Beaumont.
There are now fears in the industry and in the City, however, that the rise
of the discounters may put an end to the seemingly inexorable expansion and
profits growth of the superstores.
The number of cut-price grocery chains in the UK has risen from two in 1990
to 14, with European discounters - including Germany's Aldi, Denmark's Netto
and France's Ed - joining new UK entrants.
Discounters make money by concentrating not on margins but on shifting large
volumes of goods. Margins, prices and costs are all kept as low as possible.
The format may prove very attractive to the post-recession consumers of the
1990s.
Most forecasts see discounters increasing their share of the food market
from about 9 per cent now, to 15 per cent by 1995 and to more than 20 per
cent by the end of the decade.
To achieve that market share, they must grab sales from their competitors.
But most observers believe it is the so-called middle market - including
both independent grocers and weaker chains such as Gateway, Waitrose and the
co-operative retailers - which will suffer the most. They argue there will
still be enough customers for whom quality, choice and convenience are as
important as price, and this will ensure that the big three will not lose
many sales.
However, anecdotal evidence suggests that some superstores are already being
hit by discounters which have opened nearby.
Institutional investors, which paid out Pounds 2.2bn in rights issues in
1991 alone to fund expansion by superstore operators, are growing nervous
that the returns on those investments may be lower than projected. Food
retailing shares have underperformed the stock market by 10 per cent since
January.
Tesco is seen as the most vulnerable. It has a younger customer base, which
has been hit harder than those of its rivals by the recession and which may
be more susceptible to the charms of the dis-counters.
There are also fears that the growth of the discounters will foster a new
price sensitivity among consumers that will force all retailers, including
the big three, to sharpen their prices.
'It is hard to see how the margin growth of the last few years can continue
at the same rate,' says Mr Nick Bubb, retailing analyst with Morgan Stanley,
the US investment bank.
Food retailing shares have also been depressed by another nagging fear: that
the the food market is becoming saturated. There is only a certain number of
superstores that can be built before they start to 'cannibalise' each
other's sales.
The big three each say they have identified 100 or more suitable sites for
superstores, enough to keep them going for several years. Mr Bill Myers,
food retailing analyst at institutional brokers Henderson Crosthwaite, found
in a recent demographic survey of the UK that the highest proportion of food
retailing floor space held by the big three in any town in the country was
45 per cent. In many areas, it was less than 10 per cent. This suggested
there was still considerable room for expansion.
But the large grocers say that cannibalisation of sales is already
occurring, and each has indicated it may need to diversify or move offshore.
Tesco has bought 94 supermarkets in northern France; Sainsbury has the Shaws
chain in the US; while Argyll is developing the Lo-Cost discount format
alongside Safeway.
Retailers are fond of demonstrating the rapidly-changing nature of their
industry by citing Asda, the pioneer of superstore retailing in the UK. It
began the 1980s as one of the UK's most successful grocers, with the highest
margins, but ended the decade in severe financial difficulties after moving
away from its traditional low-price policy and over-spending on expansion.
However dominant the big three grocers might seem to be, observers suggest
they must walk a tightrope on their pricing and spending - and watch the
discounters like hawks - if they are to avoid a similar fate.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When is the Prince of Wales going to recruit somebody who really knows about
business to advise him?
Matthew Butler, the new assistant private secretary responsible for the
Prince's interests in industry and commerce, doesn't sound much different
from his predecessors.
He is the latest in a line of bright young things who have been seconded to
the Prince's private office because they supposedly knew something about
business. Lord Hanson lent the Prince a youthful Rupert Fairfax for a couple
of years, and Fairfax was followed by Guy Salter, a former personal
assistant to Sir Ralph Halpern in the days when he was running Burton. Both
were well connected public school boys in their twenties.
Butler, like Hugh Merrill who is returning to British Telecom, is little
more than a high-powered pr man, having done stints looking after the public
outpourings of the Industrial Society, Vickers and most recently Allied
Dunbar, the financial services firm.
But at least he went to a northern grammar school and has been found by a
professional firm of head hunters.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Observer: Money doesn't talk
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Campbell's monumental biography of Sir Edward Heath will be published
on Thursday and has already been criticised, notably by Lord Jenkins of
Hillhead, for being far too long. On one subject, however, it is remarkably
brief: money.
Campbell writes that when Heath became party leader in 1965 'it seems that
his personal finances were discreetly managed for him and his money well
invested.
'The Tory party has ways of ensuring that its leader is not financially
embarrassed.' Apart from adding that the main reason Heath could afford to
sail was that he was unmarried, that's about it.
Clearly the party's backers of the 1960s were more discreet than those of 20
years later.

It is hard to know who was more gloomy about Russia's prospects - Vladimir
Bukovsky, one of Russia's most famed dissidents, or Vasily Aksyonov, the
emigre writer. 'The more often I come to this country the less hope I have
of its revival,' moaned Bukovsky to a meeting of Russian scholars yesterday.
Aksyonov opined that Russia's renaissance was impossible without the West's
assistance.
Neither of these two distinguished writers, who quit Russia because of their
anti-communist beliefs, saw much to celebrate on their return. Bukovsky said
that his country's revival was impossible while it was still being led by
former communists, or 'kleptocrats' as he prefers to call them.
This sort of talk clearly upset Sergei Stankevich, one of President
Yeltsin's aides, who angrily insisted that Russia would revive, would not
need Western assistance to do so, and would find its own 'Euro-Asiatic way'
to a glorious future.

Sticking out like a sore thumb as the only big agency broker left in London,
James Capel can sometimes sound a trifle pompous about the merits of its
independence.
But it looks as if the realities of life (and the profit and loss account)
are beginning to tell and it has recruited two Warburgs men to start making
markets in the Pounds 19bn investment trust sector. Previously it has
managed to argue the case for making an exception for options, convertibles,
continental Europe and, er, HSBC stock. The longer and more diverse the

FT  29 JUN 93 / Observer: Time for a new bruiser
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When the going gets tough, the messenger often gets used for target
practice. President Bill Clinton was quick to replace his spin doctor when
he ran into trouble and now there is talk that Gus O'Donnell, John Major's
helpful press secretary and personal confidant, might be on the way out.
A couple of weeks ago he was being blamed for everything that was going
wrong. Now he is being accused of threatening to jump from the sinking ship
of state. Yesterday he was trying to brush off the speculation about his
future and said that he expected to remain in his post 'for some time'.
However, one can understand why he might change jobs sooner rather than
later.
O'Donnell has long made it clear that he does not regard his current job as
the apex of his career. Unlike his predecessor, Sir Bernard Ingham,
O'Donnell has another career waiting. He is a successful economist, although
his work on forecasting the balance of payments may have raised a few
eyebrows. He could still be a contender for the top job at the Treasury. But
given that he has turned 40 and has a young family, there is every reason to
suggest he may return to the quiet Treasury life before the next general
election, or even sooner if the right job arose.
Who might replace him? Jean Caines and Adrian Moorey, chief flacks at the
DTI and Home Office respectively, have been mentioned, as has Romola
Christopherson at Health. All have good political antennae and a rapport
with lobby journalists that would bring echoes of the professional
abrasiveness of Sir Bernard.
Indeed, there are plenty of Tory MPs who would like nothing better than to
see the lobby correspondents roughed up a bit by an old pro like Sir
Bernard.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Abolishing the gas monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS is one of Britain's more blatant monopolies. It has the
exclusive right to sell gas to the vast majority of British households, it
dominates the market for industrial gas, and it controls access to the
country's main gas pipeline system.
By the end of next month, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to decide
whether British Gas's domestic monopoly is in the public interest. It will
also, in practice, consider the case, rejected at privatisation, for
breaking up the company. The first of these questions is discussed today,
the second will be examined in a subsequent editorial.
The case for abolishing the domestic monopoly is compelling. Competition
would provide customers with choice, give British Gas a greater incentive to
cut costs and lead to greater innovation. Electricity companies, for
example, have expressed interest in entering the market and providing
customers with joint gas and electricity packages - a move which could cut
substantially administrative, customer service and billing costs. The
introduction of competition would also bring nearer the day when regulation,
which has been a source of such conflict in the gas industry, could be
relaxed.
Security of supply
British Gas, however, is opposed to releasing its monopoly grip. It has a
number of arguments. One is that security of gas supplies is better assured
in a centrally-controlled system where one entity is responsible for keeping
gas flowing. Another is that British Gas would be unable to maintain its
social obligations if exposed to competition. These obligations include
requirements to supply anyone who pays the bill and to charge all domestic
customers the same unit price for gas wherever they live and however much
gas they use.
British Gas argues that such obligations are only possible because a third
of its 18m customers bail out the other two-thirds to the tune of Pounds
250m a year. In a competitive market, rivals would simply cherry-pick the
most profitable business, leaving British Gas with all the obligations.
To anyone who has followed British Gas's long rearguard action against
reduction of its monopoly, these are familiar arguments. They are concerns
which need to be addressed but they are not reasons to hold back
competition, so long as competition takes place on a level playing field.
The experience of the multiple-supplier electricity system, which operates
on much finer margins than gas because it cannot store power, shows that
security of supply is possible in a competitive market. Similarly,
experience in the telecommunications industry shows it is possible to
maintain social obligations while introducing competition.
Ponderous giant
One way of preserving them would be to require rivals to contribute to
British Gas's 'social costs' in proportion to their market shares. But it is
also important to ask whether it is really necessary for one group of gas
consumers to subsidise another. In the longer term, the best approach would
be to phase such subsidies out.
A further argument used to defend British Gas's monopoly is that customers
have not done badly since the company was privatised in 1986. Gas prices
have fallen by 20 per cent in real terms, while surveys show customers are
satisfied.
British Gas has indeed improved its operations under the discipline of
private-sector ownership and regulatory pressure, but this is no reason for
complacency. The company remains a ponderous giant, slow to respond to
change and to bring down costs, particularly when compared to the
electricity industry where competitive pressures are sharper.
British Gas's management has set its sights on becoming a dynamic
international, entrepreneurial company. It is still some way from achieving
this transformation and so long as it remains protected from competition it
will lack the best possible spur to do so. The company is right to argue for
the interests of its shareholders with the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, but properly handled, the abolition of the domestic monopoly
need hold no terrors for British Gas.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Steady as she grows
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT CLINTON'S new communications director, David Gergen, had a rule
for the Reagan White House: keep it simple, even when it is not. The
American economy has been hard to decipher in recent months, but the simple
message is one of steady growth. If Mr Clinton has difficulties getting that
across, few of his OECD colleagues will sympathise.
The prospects for the US economy are still sturdy. Consumer price inflation
has now averaged 3.5 per cent for the first five months of 1993, with
worrying early figures appearing to be more blip than trend. The numbers for
domestic output have also wandered, but the basic improvement is worthy, if
dull. The economy looks likely to achieve 2.5 to 3 per cent growth this
year. The pace is certainly slower than in previous postwar recoveries and
job growth, too, has been lower. But it is a better performance than in any
other major industrial country. Can Mr Clinton realistically hope for more?
There are three factors which are keeping US growth forecasts sober: shaky
consumer confidence at home, the dismal state of major economies abroad, and
realism about what the economy can sustain without inflation. In the short
term, at least, none of these is likely to go away.
When news of the recovery seemed finally to be confirmed at the start of the
year, observers expected fewer mood swings from US consumers and companies.
Buying and hiring has stayed cautious, however, largely through uncertainty
about federal tax increases and healthcare reform. Things will become a
little clearer if a deficit package is finally passed in the coming weeks.
But to the extent that the implications hurt America's biggest spenders, few
would expect the added clarity to boost sales.
New pessimism
If he cannot expect much consuming zeal at home, prospects are bleaker in
Europe. Indeed, the contrast in fortunes now seems even starker than first
thought. The dollar's recent rise against the D-Mark is a sign of the new
pessimism. It is difficult to believe that a differential of 4.5 percentage
points between US and German short-term rates can be sustained much longer.
The Japanese picture is only a little better, with or without current
political uncertainties. The Japanese fiscal stimulus and the somewhat
managed climb of the yen will eventually improve conditions for US exports.
But the continued sluggishness of the Japanese economy and the effects of
appreciation are likely to make the trade picture worse before it gets
better. None of Mr Kantor's protests in Tokyo can change the fact the US and
Japan are at different points in the economic cycle, and will be for a while
yet.
Less hesitant
The president may be disappointed that he cannot offer Americans a recovery
like the heady upturn of the mid-1980s. He should not be. Inflationary fears
have been easy to ignite in recent months, partly because there may be
limited room for manoeuvre in the US economy. Alan Greenspan understands
this well. The Federal Reserve recently reduced its own estimate of US
capital stock growth over the 1980s, from 2.4 per cent per annum on average
to 1.7 per cent. This means that there is less spare capacity in the economy
than previously thought. As important, it means that Mr Greenspan will be
less hesitant to raise interest rates if inflationary pressures look
worrying. He must move in that direction sooner rather than later if
long-term rates are to stay down.
So what can Mr Clinton hope for? The answer is an investment-led recovery,
like that of the past few quarters. It will not be fuelled by government
cash, since Congress has axed most of his public investment plans. And
capital may not flow from Japan as easily as it once did, though Mr Clinton
can hardly lament that if he is consistent in his war on the trade
imbalance. Further cutting the federal deficit - which frees up domestic
funds for private investment - would do most to give the recovery stamina.
But little can be done to make it dramatic, or produce speedier job growth.
It should, however, be a more sustainable recovery than any in recent
memory. Even the most embattled president ought to find that a source of
relief.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Personal View: Now is the time to spend - Japan must boost
demand-led growth and open its markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAWRENCE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US and Japan are committed to strengthening and renewing their
partnership by adopting a new economic frame-work. This approach re-cognises
that strategic continuity in the relationship will require economic
discontinuity - a fundamental change in Japan in the way economic
integration is promoted and its benefits shared.
The US is concerned with two enduring features of Japan's relationship with
the world economy. Japan has an imbalance problem - a chronic external
surplus rooted in macroeconomic forces. And it has a penetration problem - a
peculiar resistance to foreign goods, services and investment that cannot be
explained by benign factors like geography, a modest endowment of natural
resources, or the competitiveness of its producers.
Excessive current account surpluses are always a global problem, because
they invite pressures for protection. In today's global economic environment
where demand is limited, with America and Europe consolidating their fiscal
positions and the world suffering below-par growth, Japan's growing external
surpluses are particularly significant.
What the world needs from Japan now is a sustained period of domestic
demand-led growth, making Japan a net provider of, rather than a net drain
on, jobs elsewhere.
The extra demand that would be created by a return of the Japanese current
account surplus to its historically average level of 1 1/2 per cent of gross
national product would be enough to create more than Dollars 60bn in
additional exports from the rest of the world, which would translate into an
extra 1m-2m jobs.
A reduction in the surplus of this magnitude is a prudent and realistic
objective for the Japanese government. Indeed, a more ambitious objective of
reducing the surplus from its 1990 level of 1.2 per cent of GNP was embraced
by the Japanese government in 1991.
Fiscal expansion to spur domestic demand and reduce the current account
surplus is consistent with Japan's long-run and short-run objectives:
Japan still has by far the largest fiscal cushion in the Group of Seven
leading industrial nations. Even after the last two stimulus packages, Japan
has a structural general government surplus, and the net stock of
outstanding public debt is negligible in relation to GNP unlike the rest of
the G7. Inflation is under control and excess capacity is growing.
Consumption-led growth fuelled by fiscal policy measures will not lead to
asset price bubbles. The bubble economy in the late 1980s was not caused by
too much growth in domestic demand; witness relatively stable inflation. It
was caused by excessive liquidity and savings, which were the consequence of
excessively tight fiscal policy and loose monetary policy.
Increased infrastructure spending is a better way to prepare for the
challenge of an ageing society than the prodigious accumulation of
low-yielding financial assets.
Right now, the world needs Japanese demand much more than it needs Japanese
savings. The barrier to increased investment in the industrialised and the
developing world is low capacity utilisation and low investment demand, not
an inadequate supply of capital.
Credibility is like capital. Accumulating credibility for fiscal rectitude
is not particularly valuable unless you are occasionally prepared to spend
some of it. If there was ever a time in Japan, that time is now.
Japan has frustrated foreign businessmen even in years when its surplus was
relatively low. Because of its low level of import penetration, the market
share of imported manufacturing goods in Japan is only half what it is in
the US or the European Community.
Some people misinterpret these statistics as evidence that Japan is more
competitive than its competitors. That may be tempting, but it is not
compelling. In a broad range of high-tech manufactured goods, US
manufacturers outstrip Japanese producers in third markets, but cannot get a
foot in the door in Japan.
Japan's closed market and the hostility it engenders is a significant threat
to the multilateral trading system. As long as Japanese trade barriers keep
foreign products out and Japan continues to run large surpluses, it is
difficult to mobilise support for reducing trade barriers in other
countries.
In line with its commitment to multilateralism, America's goal in the
ongoing negotiations on a new economic framework is to open Japanese markets
for the benefit of producers from all countries. Trade barrier reduction is
sought solely on a most favoured nation basis.
The focus of the new framework is on results, not because of any desire to
cut special deals for US producers unable to make it on their own, but to
ensure that market outcomes are allowed to prevail. Contrary to some
suggestions, the US is not proposing hair trigger retaliation based on
single market share targets for uncompetitive US producers. But the ultimate
test of any trade agreement is the changes it brings about. And it is
difficult to see any other way than by looking at benchmarks to monitor
progress.
The US government is not seeking to manage trade. That would be wrong -
damaging to its own interests and to the whole trading system. But it is
right to try to unmanage trade.
Removing discrimination by the government in procurement is not managing
trade. Expanding opportunities for foreign producers in markets where they
face anticompetitive business practices abetted by the government is not
managing trade. Increasing the number of operating licences granted to
foreign companies in regulated industries is not managing trade.
The lesson of trade negotiations with Japan is that exceptional measures are
sometimes necessary. There are areas where the liberalisation of formal
trade barriers has not been accompanied by improved performance by
competitive foreign producers, thus further deterring those companies from
investing in Japan. This chicken and egg problem may require a temporary
jolt, to give foreign companies the opportunities they would enjoy in fully
competitive markets.
The US-Japan economic partnership over the past 45 years has been as
productive as any economic alliance in history. Both countries must do their
part to ensure equal success in the future.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Letter: Grading as a tool for marketers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES R ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Gary Mead ('More than just ABC', June 24) is, of course, correct in
writing that the old system of socio-economic grades is inadequate for
today's marketers. The 56m or so Britons cannot be sensibly divided into six
categories for most marketing purposes.
But there is nothing new in this. As long as I can remember people have been
making this accusation, and it has always been true. Nevertheless,
socio-economic grade has been one of the factors helping marketers to define
their targets, along with sex, age, region and (sometimes) psychological
measurements.
All of these have two different functions. In the first place they are used
to help media planners decide which advertising media should be used. In the
second, they help creative people to decide what kind of message should be
used.
The former task is actually best performed by the use of a single-source
survey, such as BMRB's Target Group Index. This tells you directly the best
way to reach your target through the media. And if it turns out that this is
through a combination of the FT and The Independent, you already know some
important things about your market. Added to this should be specific study
of prospects in the market, certainly including qualitative research.
As the contributors to Gary Mead's article were suggesting, generalisations
are dangerous. But this is just as true if they are based on an attitudinal
segmentation of seven groups, as on a socio-economic segmentation of six.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Letter: Industry must get into melee of education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr NEIL A DOWNIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Dixon's article, 'Self-imposed stranglehold on recovery' (June
23), makes the important point that what matters most in the wealth of
nations is knowhow, but that Britain's universities are all about the
'know-why'. An example might be the ratio of technical staff in
manufacturing - scientists are a fraction of 1 per cent. Even in my own very
high technology field - semiconductor manufacturing equipment - the number
of people who need to know why are far outnumbered by those who need to know
how.
Part of the reason for Britain's emphasis on know-why is cultural, but part
is also due to the small role industrialists, and particularly
manufacturers, have taken in directing policy in education and science.
At least in science and technology education and R&amp;D, the time may now be
right for manufacturers to involve themselves. The new white paper,
Realising Our Potential - the first government paper on this for many years
 -is all about encouraging manufacturing industry to participate. New
mechanisms will be set up, such as Technology Foresight, led by the Office
of Science and Technology, while existing mechanisms such as the CASE
(Collaborative Awards in Science and Engineering) and the Teaching Company
Scheme will be extended. The future wealth of this nation depends upon
industry getting into the melee of education and science policy rather than
whingeing from the sidelines.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Letter: No basis for French accusations about Attali's
downfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof RICHARD PORTES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Roland Dumas, former foreign minister of France, accuses the
'Anglo-Saxon establishment' of bringing about the downfall of Jacques Attali
('Attali quits as EBRD chief 'in bank's interest'', June 26). Je regrette -
only Mr Attali himself is responsible. The 'Anglo-Saxon' press - yourselves
in the lead, to your credit - merely brought the facts to light. Indeed, you
missed some, such as Mr Attali's responsibility for losing to the World Bank
Prof Michael Bruno, former governor of the Bank of Israel, who had accepted
appointment as European Bank for Reconstruction and Development chief
economist and then withdrew.
All this is very sad, for EBRD and Mr Attali. For some time, I strongly
defended both, Mr Attali because he brought excellent people to the bank and
because he was an eloquent public voice for eastern Europe and the right
western policies for dealing with the region. Your own editorial columns
have strongly endorsed, for example, his views on opening western markets to
the east. Those who saw no need for the bank ignored the historic importance
of its mission and the unique profile of its activities. And with an African
Development Bank, an Asian Development Bank, and an Inter-American
Development Bank, what was anomalous or superfluous about the EBRD?
Last autumn it was the 'Anglo-Saxon' conspiracy behind the troubles of the
exchange rate mechanism and the franc. From Raymond Barre to Pierre
Beregovoy and President Mitterrand's chef de cabinet, we heard the absurd
story of Wall Street and the City of London leading the speculative attacks,
inspired by Washington and the UK Treasury. Then Le Figaro defended Mr
Attali against the Anglo-Saxons after your initial revelations. Now Mr Dumas
expresses what will doubtless become conventional wisdom in Paris.
In retrospect, perhaps the University of London was wrong in awarding Mr
Dumas an honorary degree, at a time when I sat on the relevant committee. It
is even more unfortunate that the Anglo-French relationship, whose cause we
believed he had served, has been weakened by foolish, thoughtless, entirely
unsupported utterances of this kind. Mr Dumas should instead have criticised
the arrogance of power and the indiscretions to which it led in the
government in which he himself participated.
The bank will survive. Under good leadership, it has an important part to
play in the economic transformation of eastern Europe and the creation of a
dynamic, integrated European economy.
Anglo-French friendship will also prosper - indeed, we are told that
relations at the official level have dramatically improved since March. I
sincerely hope so, since, like many others in the UK, I am francophile and
francophone. But to promote that friendship we must vigorously protest
instant falsifications of history by our 'friends'.
As for yourselves, Sir, you are entitled to say: 'Nous ne regrettons rien.'

FT  29 JUN 93 / Sad about Uncle Sam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you have been a knee-jerk pro-American all your life, the weekend attack
on Baghdad may have come as a disappointment. It did to me, and I suspect it
has to oth-ers.
It has certainly broken the tripartisan consensus that, until this week,
prevailed in Britain. The Labour opposition, which rejoiced at President
Bill Clinton's victory last November, is in a twist over his policy in Iraq.
This may not surprise Conservatives who regard Labour and the Liberal
Democrats as inherently anti-American. Yet in yesterday's brief debate one
Conservative backbencher warned of adverse Arab reactions, while another
noted the contrast between the robust intervention in Iraq and the lack of
anything like it in Bosnia.
Mr John Major's immediate expression of support for the US strike will be
applauded by most Tory MPs. Like Mr David Howell, chairman of the foreign
affairs committee, they view state-sponsored terrorism as such an overriding
threat that almost anything done in the name of preventing it is
justifiable. My guess is that the prime minister's endorsement of US policy
will not do him much good outside that circle.
I have been a fellow-traveller with the United States ever since I became
politically conscious: a supporter of its role in Vietnam at a time when the
then young and unheard-of Bill Clinton was declaring his opposition to that
tragic venture, an opponent of the ugly anti-Americanism that has marred
much post-1945 debate in Europe, an admirer of former president George
Bush's skill in assembling a 26-nation coalition to prosecute the Gulf war,
a citizen of the developed world who was initially pleased to see the same
president dispatch a contingent of his troops to rescue starving Somalis
from the grip of thugs and warlords.
In short, I have followed the stars and stripes. This has been the
traditional stance of those of us who were brought up to value the Atlantic
alliance. In this century American blood has been spilled, twice, to rescue
Europe from German domination. Yankee treasure was poured into the effort
that protected us from the Soviet Union for 45 years. It defeated the odious
and threatening Communist empire. If it were not for the United States, we
Europeans would not be free today. So why murmur and fidget now?
Sunday morning's raid is the proximate cause, not the whole explanation. The
unilateral firing of 23 Tomahawk cruise missiles was, in the most moderate
language of which I am capable, an inappropriate response to a failed
assassination attempt. There was no immediate necessity for the action.
There would have been if, say, an Iraqi aircraft had attacked a US warship.
That would trigger the self-defence provisions of article 51 of the UN
charter. A punitive raid, authorised by the Security Council, may yet be
necessary if Iraq is to be forced to comply with the ceasefire agreement by
which it is still bound. President Saddam Hussein remains anathema to most
of us; legitimate attempts to bring him down can only be applauded.
The botched Bush bomb plot was no such thing. It would have been better to
await the outcome of the current trial of 11 Iraqis and 3 Kuwaitis in
Kuwait. The defendants are charged with conspiring to kill Mr Bush. Prove
their guilt, and then go after their masters. Better yet, approach the UN
Security Council before, not after, giving the order to launch the missiles.
That said, the raid itself could be written down as one incident in the
incompleted war against President Saddam.
Viewing events from the eastern side of the Atlantic, it is, however,
natural to suspect that a weak president was seeking to strengthen his
political position at home by showing bravura abroad. The foreign secretary,
Mr Douglas Hurd, disagrees. Yet the noise from Washington yesterday was of
Mr Clinton receiving praise from Congress and the electorate. A common
US-based observation was that the president, who has never worn a uniform,
has at last won the admiration of his previously sceptical generals. Who
knows, he may also have earned the respect of foreign governments in advance
of the forthcoming meeting in Tokyo of heads of government of the Group of
Seven leading industrial nations.
This, too, might be dismissed as no more than a jaundiced interpretation of
the US political scene.
The deeper cause of our unease, of the shifting around in our seats, is that
President Clinton, whose understandable desire not to be distracted by
international affairs is well known, appears to believe that technical
mastery is a foreign policy. The use of missiles and high-flying aircraft is
'surgical'; if there is 'collateral damage' - that is, if civilians are
killed - the lives lost are not American. Policies that involve a serious
risk to US forces are not contemplated.
Three decisions he has taken bear this out. In Somalia, the US contingent
sent in by president Bush has handed responsibility to the UN, which has
been supported by US air strikes. In Bosnia the Clinton proposal was to
attack Serbian supply lines, from the air, and lift the embargo on sales of
arms so that the Moslems may defend themselves. This long-distance plan was
better than anything the Europeans have come up with, but it was opposed by
France and Britain, which have troops on the ground, and Russia, which has
historic links with Serbia. President Clinton proved unable, or unwilling,
to overcome their objections.
He might have done so, had he been forceful enough. The British government
was afraid that the Americans would insist on their strategy; had the US
been adamant the foreign office would have advised acquiescence. Chancellor
Kohl was willing, as he indicated at the recent European Council meeting in
Copenhagen. In sum, a strong president with a clear conception of global
strategy based on enforceable principles, might have led an alliance that
could check Serbian expansionism.
President Clinton has the brains for such a task but it is apparent that his
reading of history dictates other priorities. He will do what can be done by
electronic means, as he has in Iraq. He has yet to demonstrate that he knows
of any framework of decision-making that might replace the certainties of
the cold-war era. Uncle Sam will continue to look after us, but not
everywhere, not every time, not predictably, not at any price.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Letter: Identity no substitute for mission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I want to take issue with Mr Ahlstrom's letter ('Mission in need of
more than written message', June 18) linking mission and corporate identity.
He states that companies, particularly those with little physical presence
such as 'City organisations', need a clear 'corporate identity' to help
communicate their missions. 'The company must not only sound as though it
knows where it is going, it must also look it.'
Research at the Ashridge Strategic Management Centre has led us to a rather
different conclusion. If an organisation has a mission, if the people in the
organisation have a sense of mission about what they are trying to do and
how they are going about doing it, that mission will be plain for all to
see. Mission statements and corporate identities will be redundant.
If the people do not have a sense of mission, no amount of corporate
identity can compensate. Using a clear corporate identity to mask the lack
of a shared sense of mission will not work.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KARL LUDVIGSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The solution to the problem of funding General Motors' Saturn
Corporation ('Saturn profit poses funding dilemma - A milestone in the
history of GM's innovative sports car', June 24) is all too obvious: issue a
tranche of shares in the company to the public and institutions. Saturn was
founded by GM as a stand-alone company capable of directing its own destiny.
Now that it is turning the corner GM should be willing to allow outside
investors to participate so that Saturn can realise its full business
potential - thereby benefiting GM as well.
Such a strategy would enhance Saturn's stand-alone authority and
responsibility and help accelerate its long-overdue export programme. The
global fame of this pioneering project is not yet being significantly
exploited in markets outside North America.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Arts: Velcro tap-dancing - June in Buffalo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The city of Buffalo, at the western edge of New York state, has a
distinguished recent history as a centre for new music. Morton Feldman
taught at the university, and established short summer courses for composers
that now go on as 'June in Buffalo'. Student composers come from around the
US and beyond, to learn from senior colleagues - David Felder (Feldman's
successor), Donald Erb, Bernard Rands and Charles Wuorinen this year - and
to have the rare chance of working with an ensemble of highly skilled
musicians. One part-concert conducted by Harvey Sollberger was exemplary.
Badly composed music didn't work; good pieces - his own hair-raising 'The
Advancing Moment', or a string nonet by Jason Uenchi - did.
Erb was a particularly heartening, if also a monitory presence. He played
tapes of his two most recent orchestral pieces, 'Ritual Observances' and his
Violin Concerto, and talked freely about his musical loves (Mozart,
romanticism, jazz) and methods - about how 'Ritual Observances' grew as a
four-movement symphony out of motivic cells from the interrupted 'Lacrimosa'
that was Mozart's last creative effort, or how the concerto was similarly
rivetted on a four-note pattern. But he is no Webern. The thrust, the
boldness, the freedom and the colour are all American: his own description
of himself as an abstract expressionist was close to the mark. Now how, he
wondered, were these eager students he was talking to going to get on in a
world increasingly set on instant gratification? Where was the place for the
robust individual in, as he put it, the age of sleaze?
One answer is simple: safe in the ivory tower. The problem that faces such
events as 'June in Buffalo' is that, while ostensibly helping to train the
next generation of composers, their real function is to bring on the next
generation of professors of composition. This is sad for the world outside,
but probably not so damaging to those within university composition
departments if, as at Buffalo, there is room for the oddball not only among
students but on the staff.
Paul Elwood, a member of the Buffalo faculty, presented himself as 'velcro
tap-dance soloist' in his 'Edgard Varese in the Gobi Desert', a piece that
managed to be funny, touching and atmospheric. Velcro tap-dancing creates
noise when the velcro-soled shoe lifts off the carpet ground: with
amplification the expert soloist is able, through executing hectic stomps
and slow turns in Tai Chi style, to create vicious tears and exquisitely
protracted squeezings. These were accompanied by piano and percussion
sextet, the latter doubling as chanters, clappers and bird-whistlers in what
was a deeply serious dada ceremony, by no means unfitting for the composer
held in homage. One wonders what size Varese took in shoes.
The principal concert was devoted to just two 20-minute orchestral pieces,
Felder's percussion concerto 'Between' and Wuorinen's 'Bamboula Squared',
for orchestra with tape interventions suggesting some hybrid of honky-tonk
piano, cymbalum and a few dozen stretched rubber bands. It was a typically
spry piece, with late Stravinsky in the background. Felder's music (a duet
for flautist and computer, descending from piccolo screams to the cool dark
of the bass flute, was also played during the festival) is more in the
Carter area, though with an unashamed, zestful seize on simple intervals.
Both pieces gave the Buffalo Philharmonic difficulties, but the eventual
performances were compelling and often beautiful. Now the orchestra ought to
take these works into their regular season, and develop the relationships
formed with the two composers. But that is not the way we are going.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Arts: Antiquarian booksellers gather in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blowing the dust off the image of the old books trade is a major reason why
82 leading international dealers are gathering until Wednesday in the
Mutualite, on Paris's Left Bank, for their sixth biennial fair.
Placed under the 'haut patronage' of the country's most eminent bibliophile,
President Francois Mitterrand, this year's Foire Internationale du Livre
Ancien is the biggest ever, with 24 dealers from abroad, including five from
the US and three from London - Bernard Quaritch, B J Shapero and Sims Reed.
Professionals in the antiquarian books business regard Paris as the capital
of their trade. The city has many more top dealers than London, the French
tradition of book collecting is two centuries old and there is an abundance
of raw material which is not siphoned off by auction houses as happens in
Britain.
This year's president of the quaintly-named SLAM, which runs the fair
(Syndicat National de la Librairie Ancienne et Moderne) is dealer Dominique
Courvoisier, whose bookshop is near the Luxembourg Gardens, on the Left Bank
 -the historic heart of the Paris book trade. This year, he said, with
European frontiers open, dealers are particularly anxious to present a wide
range of their best books (there are some 20,000 on show) to create a good
image with the public, convince them that books are affordable and generally
break down their inhibitions about visiting bookshops.
According to Courvoisier, the days when the well-heeled collector patronised
a single dealer are over. Nowadays, the increasing scarcity of books and
bigger and better cataloguing mean that most collectors prefer to shop
around. The Paris fair is expected to attract French, Italian, Belgian and
German collectors, although Courvoisier says it is impossible to predict
precisely who will turn up or what will sell.
Courvoisier is asking FFr75,000 (about Pounds 8,900) for a very rare beauty
and hygiene manual for ladies printed in Lyons in 1531. Only a handful of
copies has survived 400 years' anxious consultation by women wanting to
whiten their teeth with powdered stag's horn or erase their wrinkles with a
mixture of white lilies and pale honey: for similar reasons of destruction
through regular use, very old books of cooking recipes are extremely rare.
Not all the books at the fair are either so rare, so expensive or, indeed,
so ancient. Paris dealers, Didier Lecointre and Denis Ozanne are among a
handful of specialists in the world who handle illustrated 20th century
books on art and architecture.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Arts: Boris Christoff - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bulgarian bass Boris Christoff has died in Rome at the age of 74. An
imposing presence, a voice of granite, he strode the operatic stage with an
authority that made him the ideal exponent of the roles of kings, tsars and
elder statesmen. In the Russian repertory and Italian operas, especially
those of Verdi, there was nobody to equal him in the decades immediately
after the Second World War.
After studying as a student of law, which he never liked, he was heard by
the King of Bulgaria and given funds to study in Rome with the baritone,
Riccardo Stracciari. The war years interrupted his vocal tuition and he was
eventually held in a German camp for displaced persons, but in 1946 he made
his stage debut as Colline in Puccini's La Boheme at Reggio Calabria, an
appearance from which he was never to look back. A bass voice as
well-focused, as authoritative as his comes once a generation, if that.
His first performance of Musorgsky's Boris Godunov came in 1949 at Covent
Garden. This was to be one of his two most celebrated portrayals, the other
being Philip II in Verdi's Don Carlos (seen, most famously, in Visconti's
1958 production at the Royal Opera House). In both roles his personal
magnetism was enormous, melodramatic almost in the Musorgsky, although his
ability to balance the implacable outward strength of these two characters
with a sensitive feel for their inner weaknesses made them rounded portraits
in the fullest sense.
It was as Boris Godunov that he made his American debut in 1956 in San
Francisco. By this time his career had taken in most of the world's leading
opera-houses in a repertoire that extended to the main Verdi bass roles,
Wagner's King Mark, Hagen and Gurnemanz, Beethoven's Rocco, and many other
parts in Russian operas. If most were dominating characters, that fitted his
personality. One commentator remarked that he 'laughs like Mephistopheles
and orders a drink with the tone of voice of Boris the Tsar'. Opera
managements are said to have crossed him at their peril.
The voice itself served him without fault or failing throughout his long
career. Even in concert during the 1980s, it had lost none of its rock-hard
steadiness. Recordings have captured its quality to fine effect and will
display for posterity the range of his artistic sympathies. His Philip II,
in particular, sings with quiet contemplation as well as a fearsome roar,
while showing a detailed understanding of the words. His complete set of
Musorgsky's songs is the work of a devoted song recitalist.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Arts: Harolyn Blackwell - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Looks do matter, and the way they are used matters more. On Friday, the
young soprano Harolyn Blackwell (best known in the UK from Glyndebourne
performances, notably as Clara in Porgy and Bess) made an immediate
impression of dignity and glamour as she arrived on the Wigmore Hall
platform. She is slim, black, erect, and she wore a scarlet bare-shouldered
gown that matched her earrings and lipstick. Her physical relaxation while
singing was perfect - neck and shoulders never disturbed by any quick intake
of breath - and she created an image of utterly classical repose.
In some ways, she is a classical singer. Her vowels and consonants are
perfectly married, her utterance is always precise, and she enters notes
cleanly. Her phrasing is so finely judged that you soon sense her
intelligence, but she never becomes precious or excessively contrived.
She does not, however, sound all that she looks. Her voice is not only
small, it is also lightweight. She has no chest register to speak of, and
her attack is restricted. Though she can swell a note gorgeously - the final
note of Norina's scena from Pasquale was a beautiful crescendo - she can
seldom ever take a note by force, and she lacks the brio to make Norina's
'Conosco' aria bounce. It is a pretty voice that often reveals real
loveliness, but it usually has a tremulous kind of vibrato that robs her
singing of the kind of repose that makes her appearance so appealing.
No doubt she was nervous on Friday, but a singer with her experience should
not be alarmed by the Wigmore Hall. Yet twice, a hairline crack appeared
during a sudden vocal ascent, and raised a question about the basic firmness
of her breathing. Her singing of a group of Rakhmaninov songs also suggested
that she had learnt the Russian words by rote, with recurrent
mispronunciations.
But none of these flaws spoilt the amiable and touching feeling she created
in everything she sang. Essentially, she is a Romantic, reflective and
sensitive. Even when she cannot lay forth Purcell songs with the calm
command you feel she intends, she remains eloquent at every point,
especially in recitative. Rakhmaninov is nearer the heart of her style, and
here she revealed more variety of colour. Likewise Strauss, who suits her
yet better.
She closed with Genius Child, a recent song-cycle written for her by Ricky
Ian Gordon (b. 1956). The poems (by Langston Hughes) have no great
importance, but Gordon has a real feeling for words, and for lyrical
singing. His style here derives chiefly from Britten and Copland. I think
the music has wider contrasts than Blackwell is able to reveal, but she was
at her most assured in it. In the falling iambs of Prayer (strong shades of
Britten's Hymn to Saint Cecilia), the voice was at its best - fluent,
communicative, moving affectingly between shadow and light. The spirituals
she sang as her first two encores were no less fine.

It is hard to imagine what history will make of the hysteria which took such
a hold towards the end of the 20th century that otherwise quite intelligent
people came to believe the world to be full of 'Satanists' systematically
sexually abusing children. Organisations as dignified and sensible as
Channel 4 became the conduits for claims which (as some of us noted at the
time) appeared quite ludicrous. Now, with the medical profession identifying
'False Memory Syndrome', the similarities between this scare and others such
as McCarthyism and old witch hunts are becoming apparent. In Viewpoint 93
the exposure continues with a programme by Anthony Thomas, famous for 'Death
Of A Princess' (10.40 ITV). Channel 4's culture series Rear Window (9.00) is
devoted to Sabu, the Indian child discovered by Alexander Korda and brought
to Britain to make such movies as 'The Jungle Book', 'The Thief Of Baghdad'
and of course 'Elephant Boy'. BBC2's Adultery series takes in the case of
Lady Sarah Moon who distributed her husband's wine cellar to village
doorsteps and cut the arms off his suits (9.50 BBC2).

FT  29 JUN 93 / Arts: Master pourer of thick paint - The work of Ian
Davenport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Those who hold, as so many do, that painting is dead, mean only that for
them painting is now all but irrelevant within the context of current
avant-garde preoccupation. And for them that is the only context that
matters. Neither the actual qualities vested in the work itself, nor the
profundity of the personal and general truths that it might propose, are to
be summoned up in its justification, but only the degree to which it is
currently engage, innovative, idea-led. Ask not: what is it? Ask only: where
does it lead, what does it say?
There are exceptions, of course, for painters of a certain provenance, who
make the right noises, strike the correct attitudes. But how curious it is
that so often they turn out to be rather more old-fashioned and
backward-looking than their more conventional peers, for all the seriousness
and originality of their supposed enquiry. There is no truth like an old
truth, and when a way or principle of painting comes round a second time, it
comes not full of truth and grace - oh that it had such virtues in the first
place - but as mere pastiche and decoration.
Ian Davenport is now 27. A product of the Goldsmiths' College, he was taken
up on graduation, launched on his international gallery career, nominated
for the Turner Prize. And I must say at once, on the evidence of this his
second major West End show, that he is a better painter, qua painter, than I
had supposed, master of a refined if limited technique. His use of
commercial household paints may give his future restorers nightmares, but
for the moment what he does with them he does very well.
The trouble is that, that said, what comes to mind is Gulley Jimson's
remark, when asked by his patron, Lady Beeder, what he thought of her own
modest effort, that it is 'rather like farting Annie Laurie through the
key-hole - all very clever, but is it worth the trouble?' Davenport, like
Jackson Pollock and Morris Louis before him, is a pourer, more Louis than
Pollock. But here is nothing of those great, expansive sweeps and rushes of
thin, seductive colour that so characterised the effortless 1960s. Davenport
is much more methodical than that, his systems and processes clearly laid
out, his angles set, his paint thick.
Richard Shone, in his catalogue note, tells us how it is done. 'A small
scaffold is placed next to the canvas which is positioned at a slight angle
to the vertical. The paint is poured from a vessel with an adjustable head
to regulate the breadth of each pour. Strict time is kept between the
sequence of pours allowing the paint to find its way down and off the canvas
. . . Variations in timing establish the overall tempo of each work.
Decisions include ground colour, width of run, gauging of overlap, where to
begin each pour, choice of colours . . . Broad pours give a firmer, more
solid structure . . . slender pours are more fragile . . . and wayward . .
.'
This is all fairly conventional stuff - the process that declares itself,
the image that discovers itself, the therapy that indulges itself. Painting
these days, so the rubric has it, has to be about something, and this is
painting about painting, about the disciplined accident, contrived
intuition, the automatic gesture. This is no mere response to experience, or
feeling, or the thing seen, you understand: this is serious study and
investigation.
And what we have at the end of it is a set of large, uniform canvases on
which variegated stripes of thick pigment run from top to bottom, one
overlaid upon another, now hidden, now peeping out, now fully on the
surface. The colour is arbitrary and uninflected, so this can hardly be
painting about colour. And it would be hard to say that it is about the
handling of the paint, for there is no handling, the paint all too evidently
left to shift for itself. The surface is as dull, or interesting, as
commercial paint can make it. It is, as I have said, all very clever.
Quite where this leaves Davenport, other than going through the motions, is
hard to say. The systematic engagement in the making of art is by now an
established and honourable position. I only wish he were less mechanical and
worthy in his approach to it, and the work less formulaic and predictable,
more open perhaps to the opportunities for development and exploration -
delicate, subtle and fleeting as they are - that even now chance puts in his
way.
Seven British Painters is a summer gallery show from stock that shows the
strength of figure-based painting in this country in the generation that has
now reached later-middle, indeed in certain cases manifest old age. But age
is not the point. Rather it is that at its best, work of this kind has no
less claim to be considered engage, advanced, experimental and, if you like,
truly avant-garde, than anything of Davenport and his contemporaries.
The artists are Bacon, Freud, Andrews, Auerbach, Kossoff, Kitaj and Hockney.
Two or three substantial works by each artist are shown, some early, some
more recent. There are things to recommend of each of them, but the earlier
the more intriguing, and the less familiar the better. A Bacon study for a
Pope of 1957, a highly wrought, deathly pale and sleeping nude by Freud of
1950, a Kitaj conversation-piece of 1974 are all remarkable.
My own particular favourite in this company is the Michael Andrews of 1962,
his first version of 'The Colony Room' in Soho, with the writer, Bruce
Bernard, in conversation with Francis Bacon and the formidable proprietress,
Muriel Belcher, with Lucian Freud staring fixedly out at us, from the centre
of the canvas. Unqualified by any photographic reference, it reminds us just
how vigorous a painter of the figure composition, in the good old-fashioned
sense, Andrews once was.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Business and the Law: Long arm of American law - A US
anti-trust case with worldwide implications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A long-awaited US Supreme Court decision in an insurance anti-trust case was
delivered yesterday but it has failed to provide the hoped-for guidance to
foreign governments and businesses on the extra-territorial reach of US
regulatory law.
The case involved complaints filed by 19 US states alleging the defendants -
four US primary insurers, two US trade associations, a US reinsurance broker
and Lloyd's of London reinsurers - had violated the Sherman Act, America's
main piece of anti-trust legislation. The defendants were accused of a
conspiracy over a three-year period from 1984 to 1987 aimed at forcing
certain other US primary insurers to change the terms of their standard
commercial general liability insurance polices to conform with policies the
defendants wanted to sell.
The US district court dismissed the actions holding that the defendants were
entitled to anti-trust immunity under the terms of the McCarran-Ferguson Act
which exempts from federal regulation 'the business of insurance' except 'to
the extent that such business is not regulated by state law'.
The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district court decision,
ruling that although the conduct involved was clearly 'the business of
insurance' the foreign reinsurers at Lloyd's did not fall within the
exemption because their activities could not be 'regulated by state law',
and that the US insurers had forfeited their exemption because they had
conspired with the non-exempt British insurers.
The circuit court also rejected the district court's conclusion that the
principle of international comity barred it from exercising jurisdiction
under the Sherman Act in relation to the claims against the London
reinsurers.
The principle of international comity provides that where two countries'
jurisdictions are in conflict, each country must examine its own and the
other country's interest in exercising jurisdiction and defer where the
other county's interest is clearly greater.
At one level the case was extremely important to US businesses nearly all of
which are required to carry commercial general liability insurance. At
another, however, the case had just as much significance for European
businesses and governments. In deciding whether the US courts had
jurisdiction over the involvement of Lloyd's underwriters in the alleged
anti-competitive conduct, it was hoped the Supreme Court would address the
vexed question of the appropriate extra-territorial reach of US anti-trust
laws.
Yesterday the court concluded that the Sherman Act did apply to the conduct
complained of and that the US courts did have jurisdiction over the Lloyd's
reinsurers.
But by confining its decision to the particular facts of this case and
ruling that there was no conflict between US and British jurisdiction
(because Britain does not regulate the kind of conduct complained of) the
court failed to provide the fundamental statement of the law on the
extra-territorial application of US anti-trust laws which businesses and
governments on both sides of the Atlantic had been hoping for.
According to Mr Gary Born, a partner with US law firm Wilmer Cutler &amp;
Pickering, the extra-territorial application of US laws has long produced
significant diplomatic frictions between the US and its trading partners.
This is not only true of anti-trust laws but also of export controls and
securities laws as well.
The extra-territorial application of US laws has also aroused substantial
concern in the international business community, he says.
'Extra-territorial applications of national laws often create substantial
uncertainty and the risk of conflicting legal requirements. This chills
international commerce and investment and can sometimes impose considerable
injustice on private parties caught between national legal regimes.'
For almost 200 years up to the second world war US courts relied on what
became known as a 'presumption of territoriality' to determine the reach of
federal legislation. Unless there was a clear indication from Congress that
a statute should apply outside US territory, federal legislation would be
presumed to apply only to conduct within US territory.
After the war, the basic rule changed. In the Aluminum Co of America (Alcoa)
case of 1945, the Supreme Court adopted what became known as an 'effects
test' for determining the extra-territorial application of the US anti-trust
laws. Abandoning strict adherence to the presumption of territoriality, the
court said the anti-trust laws would in future apply not merely to
anti-competitive conduct on US territory but also to conduct outside US
borders that has 'effects' in US territory or on US commerce.
This remained the law until 1976 when, in a case called Timberlane, the 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals placed a restriction on the Alcoa 'effects test'
which had been heavily criticised because it allowed expansive
extra-territorial application of US law.
The court tempered the effects doctrine by adding a so-called 'rule of
reason' which equated broadly with principles of international comity. The
rule of reason provided that US law would not be applied extra-territorially
to foreign conduct if the balance of foreign interests in exercising
jurisdiction outweighed US interests.
Given the history of the extra-territorial application of US regulatory
statutes since 1945, most observers would until recently have expected the
court to follow Timberlane or adopt some modification of the Alcoa effects
test in the present case. But in 1991 the court resurrected the presumption
of territoriality in three cases, the most significant being the Aramco
case, in which the court ruled that US anti-discrimination laws did not
extend to discrimination against workers outside the US.
That decision left the precise extent of the extra-territorial application
of US laws uncertain and business and governments were looking to the court
in the present case to clarify the position.
'The court's decision on the extra-territoriality is unsatisfactory and very
disappointing, ' says Mr Born.
First, the court refused to address directly the question whether the
Timberlane rule of reason or principles of international comity restrain the
extra-territorial reach of US anti-trust laws. That will perpetuate the
uncertainty which confronts international businesses and their legal
advisers, he says.
Second, the court said that assuming that principles of comity do apply in
the anti-trust sphere, comity only applied where a direct legal conflict
between US and foreign laws existed. That is an exceedingly narrow and
probably unsound view, Mr Born says.
Few foreign states and businesses will be happy with the court's unanimous
conclusion that the anti-trust laws have extra-territorial application. The
only conceivable silver lining, Mr Born says, is that Justice Souter's
majority opinion can be read to suggest that the anti-trust laws apply
extra-territorially only where foreign conduct 'was meant to produce and did
in fact produce some substantial effect in the US'. That standard, if
rigorously enforced in the lower courts, could provide limits to the
extra-territorial reach of US law that some foreign observers might find
acceptable.
In general, he adds, the court's opinion is badly out of step with
contemporary understanding of what comity requires. 'It is a result which
will cause no little distress to both international businesses and the
international legal community.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
James Capel has chosen another area to begin making markets - investment
trusts. It has recruited two traders, who have both recently left SG
Warburg, a leading broker in the sector, from September.
A well known figure in the market for many years, Bill Cornish (pictured far
right), 46, built up the investment trust team at jobbers Akroyd and
Smithers, which was bought by Warburgs in 1985. He let Warburg this March.
David Cockbill (above left) is a former colleague of Cornish. He had joined
Akroyd in 1979, and made markets in the sector between 1984 and 1992.
Unlike Warburg, which claims to make markets in all the 500 plus bits of
paper (including warrants and so on) associated with the sector, Capel will
'certainly not cover the whole world of investment trusts' according to Bob
Benton, managing director of James Capel. Benton says he has not decided how
much capital to allocate to the operation.

FT  29 JUN 93 / People: Old hands at James Fisher's helm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
James Fisher, which controls one of Britain's biggest short-sea shipping
fleets, has brought a couple of the shipping industry's elder statesmen out
of lay-up to help guide it through current harsh trading conditions.
Sir David Hardy, 62, a former finance director of Ocean Transport, and Sir
David Thomson, 53, a former joint managing director of the family-owned Ben
Line, have been appointed non-executive directors of James Fisher and Sons.
The Cumbria-based group, which is still controlled by descendants of the
founding families, has a fleet of around 30 ships and has port operations in
Newhaven, Heysham, Barrow and Whitehaven.
In addition to its own fleet the firm manages another 30 vessels, including
the British Nuclear Fuels fleet, and has a reputation for running safe and
dependable ships. However, this expertise has not insulated it from the
downturn in the industry and its pre-tax profits have fallen from Pounds
4.3m in 1989 to Pounds 1.5m in 1992. Last year it cut its dividend.
John Hornby, Fisher's chairman and managing director, says that he had
wanted directors who had shipping experience but did not work for the
competition. 'We are at the specialist end of a very small industry,' says
Mr Hornby, who doesn't believe that non-execs drawn from the general
business world would be much help.
Sir David Hardy, who sits on the board of Hanson and numerous other
companies, resigned from Ocean Transport more than a decade ago, and Sir
David Thomson quit Ben Line in 1989 after 28 years with the company.
The latter's appointment is particularly appropriate since he is understood
to have left Ben Line after a disagreement over the future direction of what
used to be one of the great names of the British shipping industry. Since he
left, Ben Line has withdrawn from mainline shipping. Meanwhile his brother,
William Thomson, also left Ben Line and is now running Edinburgh Tankers.
Three Fisher directors - Mike Shields, Mike Tyrell and Terry Blyth - are
stepping down from the board but will remain as executive directors.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Business and the Law: Tobacco warning rules clarified -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice last week clarified in two cases the scope of
discretionary powers available to European Community states when fixing
health warnings on cigarette packets and other tobacco products.
The first case related to British rules on the size of health warnings and
their compatibility with EC law. Under the terms of the tobacco products
directive, all cigarette packets for sale in the Community must carry health
warnings which cover at least 4 per cent of the surface of the packet.
Under the UK's rules, brought into force to give effect to the directive,
health warnings must cover 6 per cent of the surface of a packet. Cigarettes
imported from other EC states are deemed to comply with UK law if the health
warnings comply with the requirements adopted by the exporting country in
implementing the directive.
The court was asked for a preliminary ruling on whether UK regulations were
compatible with the directive. It said the directive laid down common rules
for the labelling of tobacco products in the Community. Some rules gave
states no discretion to impose stricter requirements; others allowed a
degree of discretion. Such discretion was allowed in relation to health
warnings. The directive set down a minimum surface area. EC member states
were entitled to increase the area to be covered.
The court accepted that its decision, which was contrary to the earlier
opinion of the advocate general, might lead to less favourable treatment for
national products compared with imports, but it ruled that this was an
unfortunate consequence of setting out only minimum requirements on the size
of health warnings in the directive.
The second case involved Italian rules on health warnings. The Italian rules
require manufacturers to put two health warnings on cigarette packets and
require warnings covering at least 4 per cent of the surface for other
tobacco products. The court said there was no discretion under the directive
to require more than one health warning.
The court said that as far as other tobacco products were concerned the
directive set out different conditions than those for cigarettes. Health
warnings simply had to be printed so that they were clearly legible and
easily seen. There was no discretion for EC member states to impose more
stringent requirements for warnings on other tobacco products.
C-11/92: R v Secretary of State for Health, ex parte Gallagher, Imperial
Tobacco and Rothmans International Tobacco (UK); C-222/91: Ministero delle
Finanze &amp; Ministero dell Sanita v Philip Morris Belgium and others, ECJ 5CH,
22 June 1993.
Danish public procurement contract breached EC law
Nearly four years after the case was first lodged with the European Court,
judgment was given last week on the public procurement contract for the
construction of the bridge across the Grand Belt, which divides Denmark in
two.
The court found the contract was flawed in two respects. First, by insisting
that construction companies were to use as high a percentage of Danish
materials as possible, the state-owned company in charge of the project was
found to be in breach of EC law.
The court said despite the removal of the clause in question, the tendering
process had been tainted and that its removal at the last stage of the
operation prior to signature was not sufficient to validate the breach.
Second, the court found the successful tender had not been made in
conformity with the tender offer conditions. The fact that the company in
charge of operations had even considered that tender breached the
fundamental principle of equal treatment.
The court said it was irrelevant that the EC directive on public procurement
did not specifically mention the right to equal treatment for tenderers, as
the obligation to respect the principle corresponded with the directive's
very essence.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ron Calver, 48, general manager of Norwich Union's UK life operations, is to
leave the company after 10 years in that position.
Calver's duties will be covered by Phillip Scott, general manager (finance)
and chief actuary, who took on the office vacated by the last NU director
who took early retirement, Hugh Scurfield.
Norwich Union's directors have their work cut out for them. In 1992, its
board recorded a pre-tax loss of Pounds 18m, but took comfort from the fact
that the loss was significantly smaller than that recorded in the two prior
years. Also, it has made progress in improving its regulatory capital.
Meanwhile, NU, renowned for flexing its muscle as an institutional
shareholder on matters such as directors' pay, is mum on how much it will
pay to Calver for his early retirement. Scurfield received Pounds 146,000
for loss of office last year.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Business and the Law: Mareva injunction ruling defines SIB's
powers - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's Securities and Investments Board does not have to give
cross-undertakings in damages in relation to Mareva injunctions granted to
support claims for restitution and compensation, the High Court has ruled.
Mareva injunctions are granted to prevent defendants removing their assets
from the jurisdiction of UK courts in order to avoid a judgment.
The ruling in SIB's action against Mr Ian Lloyd-Wright, an offshore
investment salesman, is widely seen as a significant definition of SIB's
powers. It is the first occasion the issue has been fully argued in court.
SIB has been granted a number of injunctions restraining the movement of Mr
Lloyd-Wright's assets, including one enforcing a worldwide Mareva.
Mr Justice Morritt said the Mareva was a remedy provided by statute for the
benefit of the public at large or those who had suffered from infringements
of the Financial Services Act. It was as much a matter of law enforcement as
the granting of an interlocutory injunction, so a cross-undertaking in
damages was not required.

FT  29 JUN 93 / People: Davison departs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'disappointed' Gerald Davison, the motor trade veteran who first made a
name for himself knocking Honda's UK sales network into place as director of
operations in the early 1980s, has departed as chairman of motor distributor
Keep Trust.
The move follows Keep's sale by its Dublin-based parent group Fitzwilton to
dealer T Cowie for Pounds 40m.
Davison took on the Keep job in 1990 on the basis that it would be built up
and floated at an appropriate time - 'so its disposal has been something of
a disappointment.'
Early warning that Fitzwilton was deciding to step out of motor business -
its Pounds 500m turnover is provided largely by cash and carry, light
manufacturing and luxury goods sales - came at the end of last year.
At that time it sold off its Norfolk Finance car leasing subsidiary -
chairman Gerald Davison - to US giant AT &amp; T.
Davison, 50, who briefly stepped out of the motor trade in the mid-1980s to
run Jersey's Evening Post publishing group, says he will being looking for
'another challenge' in the motor industry - but he will not do so until he
has finished the final polishing of his second book on Chinese art.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Technology: Is there a doctor on the screen? - The use of
telemedicine in remote communities is only now being fully explored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When George Walker, a physician at the Dodge County Hospital in rural
Georgia, sees a patient with a difficult case, he has an option not open to
most other country doctors. Instead of sending his patient to a distant,
more sophisticated medical centre, he and the patient can sit in front of a
video camera for a teleconference-style consultation with a specialist 130
miles away at the Medical College of Georgia.
Dodge County Hospital and the MCG are participating in an experiment with
telemedicine - the application of telecommunications technology to the
practice of medicine.
Although the technology has been known for years and is largely 'off the
shelf', according to Jay Sanders, chief of the MCG's Telemedicine Centre,
its use for a variety of medical purposes is only now being fully explored.
But experts say it could be an important answer to the question of how to
raise the quality of healthcare in rural and other under-served areas, while
at the same time reducing its cost. 'We really see a great future for this,'
says Dina Puskin, director of the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy in
Washington.
According to the US Health Resources and Services Administration, 35m
Americans live in medically under-served areas. These areas fail to meet the
criterion of one primary-care physician per 3,500 people or one per 3,000
people in high-need locations. Prisons and mental hospitals, where transport
of patients can be costly and difficult, are also prime targets for
telemedicine.
Puskin, who is also on the White House task force for healthcare reform led
by Hillary Rodham Clinton, cautions, however, that while the federal
government provides some funds for pilot projects in telemedicine, more
experience would have to be gained before the system could be applied
throughout the country.
Georgia's Dollars 350,000 (Pounds 230,000) pilot programme, which began in
September 1991 with state and private funding, is the most sophisticated use
of telecommunications for healthcare in the US. It includes teleconferencing
and upgraded medical devices such as an electronic stethoscope that
magnifies the heartbeat or the sound of lungs breathing. Other diagnostic
tools such as X-rays and ultrasound images can be transmitted to
high-resolution monitors for study.
The MCG is even working with the Georgia Institute of Technology to develop
an electronic hand that will simulate a physical examination. The patient's
doctor would don a glove to perform an examination, while the specialist,
miles away, would place his hand in a sensory generator and feel the same
texture, force and temperature.
The speed and accuracy of digital transmission has helped boost
telemedicine's possibilities, including conferring with specialists during
surgery. Walker believes that for a rural physician and his patients
'communication is the major thing' that telemedicine offers. 'Patients love
it,' he says, because they are reassured they are being cared for properly
and relieved they do not have to travel far from their families and friends
for treatment. Walker adds that, for him, conferring with specialists has
'been a valuable educational tool'.
At least 11 other states either have telemedicine programmes or are about to
begin them. Many of these are relatively limited pilot projects, but the
information from this wider number of experiments should help answer some of
the questions about telemedicine.
The primary one is cost. Sanders says it requires a maximum investment of
about Dollars 300,000 in equipment for a hospital to establish a
telemedicine hook-up. By his calculation, if telemedicine keeps one patient
per day at the rural hospital instead of having him or her referred to
another institution, the hospital's net cash flow increases by Dollars
150,000 per year, making it possible to offset the investment in a
relatively short time.
But Puskin points out that expensive obstacles can exist. Some rural areas
may not yet have adequate telecommunication lines and creating such
infrastructure is costly. She also says: 'The financial equations will look
better when the cost of equipment comes down - and the prices are coming
down.'
Another question for telemedicine is whether physicians will accept and use
it. Sanders notes that doctors as a group have been relatively slow to use
computers. And experts agree that there is little point in small community
hospitals' investing in expensive technology if their doctors will not use
it.
But some doctors have balked with good reason. They have been forced to
fight for reimbursement from insurance plans that refuse to recognise their
telemedicine services. The insurers generally have been willing to cover
radiology and pathology services because the transmitted images involved in
those consultations are regarded as the same as looking at the real thing.
Other types of consultations do not, however, meet an insurance requirement
for the 'laying on of hands' and have been ruled out.
While the American Medical Association has weighed in on the side of
telemedicine to win doctor reimbursement, the issue is not yet resolved. But
'it will be' and in the doctors' favour, says Ted Hartman, who directed a
telemedicine programme in Texas and is now an executive with insurer Blue
Cross Blue Shield of Texas. 'It has to be because that's the way health care
will be delivered.'
Once reimbursement is approved by the federal Medicare programme, which
insures healthcare for the elderly, private insurers 'will fall into line,'
predicts Hartman.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Visitors to this year's Wimbledon tennis championships can avoid some of the
frustration involved in watching one match while hearing the roar of an
excited crowd from the adjacent court.
The Inquiry Tennis Information Service will allow them to keep up with
events around the grounds using a multimedia system combining television
coverage, latest scores, match schedules and player profiles.
Designed by IBM in conjunction with Wimbledon officials and the BBC to give
commentators instant access to statistics and historical information,
Inquiry has this year been extended to the public.
A touch-screen terminal allows spectators to watch up to three live matches
in windows on the screen. It also displays data including aces, double
faults, forehand and backhand winners, net points earned and total points.
Historical information can be called up, too, showing players' track records
and world rankings.
Other options include a rundown on matches in progress with scores from all
courts and a match schedule. Visitors can use this to plan their day by
entering either the name of the player they want to watch or the courts to
which they have access. Souvenir hunters can take away a print-out profiling
and picturing their favourite players.
Further layers of sophistication being considered include a sound system
which could pinpoint the ball to within 10mm and monitor players' accuracy
in hitting just short of the service-line and baseline.
John Taylor, an IBM consultant in charge of the Wimbledon project, admits
that the public is still slightly reluctant to use the system but says it
has already found popularity among commentators, players and coaches who use
it to analyse match play and assess competitors' strengths and weaknesses.
The Inquiry service available to commentators and players uses software from
the Spanish company Micro Systems Lagiscta. US sports specialists
Information &amp; Display Systems developed the software for the public system.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Technology: Human limits on information age - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOES the age of information technology need a new economics? Yes, according
to Michael Rothschild, a US high-tech management guru. The invention of
microprocessors and fibre-optics capable, respectively, of processing and
transmitting ever-increasing volumes of information means that the old
metaphors we use to understand the economy are no longer appropriate.
During the industrial age it made sense to describe the economy as an engine
and think of workers as cogs in a huge machine. In order to make the economy
or a company work, all that was necessary was to press the right combination
of buttons or pull the right levers.
But this mechanistic mind-set has outlived its usefulness, Rothschild argued
in a lecture earlier this month at the Institute of Economic Affairs, the
London free-market think-tank.
It is not just the central planners of the old Soviet bloc who have
discovered this. Increasingly, managers of hierarchical organisations and
politicians in the capitalist world are finding that their old techniques do
not produce the predictable results they once did.
The explanation, according to Rothschild, is that the explosion of
information means that it is no longer possible or desirable to control
companies or economies mechanistically. His alternative approach, dubbed
bionomics, is to view the economy as an ecosystem. Both are 'vast
decentralised information networks that no one planned and no one controls -
enormously vibrant and always changing'.
There are interesting parallels. The methods used for encoding information
in DNA are similar to computer programming language. The food chain in
biology is analogous to the value chain in the economy, with part of an
organisation's products being consumed by other organisations and part
returning in the form of profits to enable the organisation to 'reproduce'
and grow.
There are also parallels between the Darwinian process of evolution through
specialisation and natural selection, and the way the economy mutates. Most
importantly, the key to success in both biology and economics is learning
through experience. This leads to the conclusion that managers and
politicians should not seek to control behaviour through bureaucratic
systems but to find ways to enable their organisations to learn faster from
experience.
There is much appeal in this analogy. But whether it amounts to a new
economics is doubtful. Adam Smith, back in the 18th century, explained how
competitive markets resulted in the survival of the fittest.
This century, the Austrian economist Friedrich von Hayek stressed that free
markets fostered experimentation, learning and dynamism because individuals
were able to respond to information generated at a local level.
Moreover, Rothschild is perhaps a little too gung-ho about microprocessors,
fibre-optics and other gizmos of the information age. These new technologies
clearly have a part in improving productivity, but they are not the whole
picture.
What matters is not so much crude information as judgment. Modern executives
are already bombarded with junk mail, junk faxes and junk phone calls.
However fast computers are able to process information, there will still be
a constraint on how much information humans can digest.
Similarly, what matters is not so much cheap channels of communication as
developing long-term relationships with suppliers, customers, employees and
other stakeholders. The performance of Japanese and German economies has
shown the value of such long-term relationships as compared with
Anglo-American short-termism. However cheap it becomes to transmit
information, there will still be constraints on the number of high-quality
relationships humans can maintain.
Information technology can generate wealth, but only within the limits of
human psychology.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
What does a Franco-Polish joint venture in waste disposal have in common
with a British-Belgian marketing alliance in translation services?
The answer is that the entrepreneurs behind both initiatives were
participants in the 1992 Euroleaders programme, an annual three- to
four-week project funded by the European Commission which provides practical
help and training to 20-25 innovative companies.
Euroleaders was designed to equip small and medium-sized businesses with the
skills to operate on the European stage. But as Giles Trentham, managing
director of the London-based translation company Wordbank, says, it is often
the cross-border contacts developed on the course which can be most
valuable.
Inspired by his experience, Trentham has established the Euroleaders club, a
network of alumni which holds its first reunion in London this weekend. His
vision is of a 250-strong group in five to 10 years' time.
The two tangible examples of co-operation are Wordbank's own alliance, to
promote its translation service to international companies based in Belgium,
and the Franco-Polish venture aimed at converting rubbish into fertiliser.
The latter requires about Pounds 500,000, expected to come from local
government sources in Poland and the EC.
The 1993 Euroleaders programme, sponsored by PA Consulting, KPMG, Publicis,
Ceran and the Financial Times, attracted more than 1,000 applicants. Two
sessions have already been completed in Belgium and Italy, with preparation
of a business plan on the agenda for the final meeting in Brussels in
September.
EC officials hope to run two programmes in 1994.
Information on the programme can be obtained from the Euroleaders
Secretariat, EBN, Avenue de Tervuren 188A, Brussels B-1150. Details on the
club from Giles Trentham, 101 Talbot Road, London W11 2AT.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Joining the extended
family - The varying fortunes of the German Mittelstand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Falken Registraturen is a typical example of the Mittelstand, the small and
medium-sized companies that formed the backbone of western Germany's postwar
economic success. It employs 240 people and sells paper products, ranging
from files and envelopes to notepads and office material.
But Falken, managed by 30-year-old Gunther Becker, is located in the state
of Brandenburg, in the tough business community of what was East Germany.
And against all the odds, the company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Wilhelm
Becker Papiergrosshandlung, a trading house in the Rheinland, is surviving.
Equally surprising is that Becker had no experience in running a paper
factory, let alone operating in an eastern German environment.
'Everybody warned me about the effect 40 years of state planning had had on
the labour force. But here, my staff is committed and motivated. They work
hard. They want the plant to be a success. Indeed, it is they who have
taught me everything I now know about making paper products,' Becker says.
Since taking over the plant two years ago, the parent company has invested
about DM50m (Pounds 20m), mostly on new equipment - which has raised
productivity to 80 per cent of western German levels - and on
infrastructure. As a result, Falken has already captured about 20 per cent
of the eastern German market, and about 15 per cent of the western German
market, largely through direct sales contracts to companies. 'We can even
talk about small profits, of between 1 and 3 per cent on our current
turnover of DM42m,' Becker says.
Like many of the Mittelstand in eastern Germany, Falken's future is
dependent on several factors: support from the mother company in western
Germany, investment grants and tax breaks, and confidence that the
Mittelstand will eventually flourish, not next year, nor even in five years,
but in 10 years. 'These grants are reduced and phased out over time,' Becker
says. 'So anyone coming to eastern Germany must remember that this is a long
haul. You have to think in the very long term. There are no quick fixes.'
Yet there were no quick solutions to rebuilding the Mittelstand in western
Germany after 1945, except that, unlike eastern Germany of today, western
Germany had one big advantage: the tradition of small, family-run
enterprises was still intact.
'In the eastern states, because of several decades of central planning, you
do not have the memory, the habit, or the continuity of an
entrepreneurial/enterprise culture. You do not have the families which make
up the Mittelstand in western Germany,' explains Wolf-Dietrich von Bothmer
from Deutsche Bank's branch in Dresden. Hence the importance of investment
from the west.
Another difficulty for the Mittelstand in eastern Germany is the loss of
markets in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, caused by Bonn's
decision to introduce monetary union in 1991. Before unification, more than
50 per cent of eastern Germany's output was exported eastwards. Today, such
exports hardly exist.
'When the Mittelstand in western Germany re-emerged after 1945, these
companies could anchor themselves to an expanding industrial base,' says
Richard Reid, an economist at Union Bank of Switzerland in Frankfurt.
'Eastern Germany does not have that advantage.'
That said, green-field plants - such as Opel's car manufacturing operation
at Eisenach or the large recycling plant that Enso Gutzeil, the Finnish
paper manufacturer, will build near Leipzig - should eventually fill the
gap.
The importance of local customers is underlined by Heiner Holzemann, manager
of a chemical and gas containers plant in Furstenwalde, Brandenburg, owned
by the west German Kramer group.
'When we bought the plant from the Treuhand (the agency charged with
restructuring and privatising eastern German industry), we made a decision
to concentrate on the local region first, otherwise transport costs would
swallow up our turnover.' The plant employs 421 people and had a turnover of
DM59m in 1992.
But Holzemann knows he has to look further afield 'otherwise we would reach
a saturation point at a very early stage. Being so close to the Polish
border, we are in an ideal location. This firm had contacts with the region
before 1989. We are now beginning to re-establish them. Don't forget that
Russians will be building gas pipelines. There will be a need for our liquid
and gas containers. We have to look to the long term'.
Despite the energy and commitment of managers like Holzemann, eastern
Germany's Mittelstand continues to be inhibited by poor infrastructure, the
high level of risk and uncompetitive practices. 'The infrastructure is
improving,' Holzemann says. 'When we first came here, there were no phones,
no decent meeting rooms, no accounts. You have to start from scratch.'
A bigger worry perhaps is the east's competitiveness. Reid points out that
partnership between industry, the banks, the states, and the unions has been
slow to emerge. Had such a partnership existed immediately after unification
in 1990, eastern Germany's labour costs might have provided one of the
engines for recovery. But the decision by IG Metall, the country's powerful
engineering union, and the employers to equalise eastern and western wages
by 1995 has meant that in the short term at least the five new states are no
sanctuary for low labour costs.
Deutsche Bank, which, through two of its holdings, Deutsche
Industrie-Holding and Deutsche Beteiligungsgesellschaft, has invested DM146m
in the Mittelstand in eastern Germany, has added its critical voice to
industrial policy in the region. It deplores the degree of subsidies given
to those enterprises still managed by the Treuhand.
'It will slow up the competitiveness of eastern German industry and the
Mittelstand,' says George Krupp, a Deutsche Bank board member. He argues
that plans to establish a Treuhand-managed industrial core of companies that
cannot yet be privatised will act as a brake on the development of the
Mittelstand. Some Mittelstand managers even complain of dumping. 'Sometimes
I feel that if we do not win an order it is because Treuhand-owned firms can
offer far cheaper prices,' says Peter Streckmann, technical director of the
Kramer plant.
Yet managers like Becker and Holzemann are still prepared to buckle down and
compete in eastern Germany. 'I suppose we are here because we believe in
unification and want it to succeed,' Becker says. 'It has to, hasn't it?'

FT  29 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Western firms get leaner
and fitter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Not surprisingly, in the country's worst recession since the second world
war, Germany's Mittelstand companies are suffering. But according to the
head of Germany's largest independent venture capital firm, they are not
necessarily doing as badly as their bigger, stock-market quoted competitors.
'It is my impression that 50 per cent of the Mittelstand has not felt the
impact of the recession at all,' says Thomas Schlytter-Henrichsen, joint
managing director of the German arm of 3i, the UK venture capital firm. 'In
fact many companies have record order-books.'
Germany has 15,000 companies with turnovers of between DM20 and DM200m and
only 665 quoted companies. The Mittelstand employs 75 per cent of the
workforce and generates 50 per cent of non-state sector GNP.
According to Schlytter-Henrichsen the outlook is mixed. Suppliers of
components to the big German car manufacturers are suffering as their
customers wage war on costs. Manufacturers are demanding price cuts of as
much as 30 per cent, insisting on a simplification of component supplies,
and cutting the number of suppliers they are prepared to do business with.
In the machine-tool sector, a traditional stronghold of German manufacturing
industry, companies are under intense competitive pressure from lower-cost
Japanese rivals - and an overall slump in world demand for capital goods.
It has been suggested that Baden-Wurttemberg, a state in the south-west of
Germany where there is a large concentration of family businesses in both
stricken sectors, will be the German 'crisis-region' of the 1990s.
But according to Schlytter-Henrichsen, the gloom is far from universal,
especially in service-sector companies and those involved in the
construction industry, either directly or as suppliers. Here, profits are
continuing to rise from last year's record levels.
A survey* of 201 Mittelstand companies published recently by 3i shows 30 per
cent of companies expect profits to climb again this year and another 32 per
cent anticipate levels similar to last year.
An overwhelming majority - 81 per cent - plans to rationalise as a way of
dealing with mounting costs. The companies think this preferable to setting
up plants in countries with lower wage costs.
This rationalisation will not necessarily be at the expense of the workforce
 -60 per cent plan to keep staff numbers at current levels or to expand. And
45 per cent intend to maintain capital investment at the same high level as
last year.
'This is the big difference between the way German medium-sized companies
and UK companies of similar size have reacted to recession,'
Schlytter-Henrichsen says. 'German companies are still investing - albeit at
a lower level - whereas in the UK investment ground to a halt.
'Many Mittelstand companies are taking advantage of the downturn to push
through rationalisation measures which they could not have contemplated in
better times,' he says. 'Profits may go down this year but not dramatically
so - and when the upturn comes, the companies will emerge leaner, fitter and
more competitive than ever before.'

FT  29 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Howard outlines blueprint for
police
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE white paper on police reform published yesterday sets out a Home Office
blueprint intended to forge a new partnership between Britain's police force
and the community against crime.
Unveiling wide-ranging plans for what he called 'a police service for the
21st century', Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, said they would enable
the police to better focus on a clear set of priorities while revitalising
community support for their activities.
The plans include the recruitment of more special constables, the
strengthening of local police authorities, greater flexibility to fix local
policing budgets and the regular publication of performance targets and
results for individual forces.
Mr Howard said there were four main elements to his proposals, all of which
he would like to see in place by April 1995.
To strengthen links with the public he is setting a new target to raise the
number of special constables in England and Wales from the present total of
nearly 20,000 to 30,000.
Local police authorities, which will be smaller, will develop local policing
plans in consultation with the public and have to publish their performance
to compare with other forces. To make police authorities better reflect
local interests the government says they will have 16 members, comprising
eight local councillors, three magistrates and five local people appointed
by the home secretary, who will also appoint a paid chairman.
In collaboration with the chief constable, police authorities will set their
own budgets, allowing the Home Office to relinquish detailed controls on
staffing and capital expenditure.
Authorities will decide on the best mix of police officers, civilian staff,
equipment and other resources. Central government grants will, however, be
cash-limited.
The home secretary will set out the main objectives for the police service,
providing a national framework for assessing police performance.
Mr Howard, who said he wanted to see less 'paper pushing', also announced a
review of administration procedures.
He said he wanted the Home Office to retain responsibility for the
Metropolitan Police, in spite of the suggestion by Mr Kenneth Clarke, his
predecessor, that the capital might get its own independent police body.
But he said he would no longer rely solely on advice from Home Office
officials and would establish a new body to set the Metropolitan Police
budget, monitor its performance and publish annual performance results.
The home secretary said he accepted that it might be desirable eventually to
reduce the number of police forces operating in England and Wales from 43,
but added that amalgamations should only take place after progress had been
made on his other reforms.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Iraq bombing wrecks cross-party
consensus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR mounted a fierce attack on the government's backing for the US
bombing of Baghdad at the weekend, challenging its basis in international
law and saying that it should never have taken place.
The cross-party consensus between the two front benches on the government's
approach to Iraq, which survived through the Gulf war, broke down yesterday
as Mr George Robertson, Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, condemned the US
strike as 'dubious in legality, questionable in morality, haphazard in its
military impact and potentially devastating in diplomacy'.
The fracturing of opinion at Westminster was underlined by the fact that a
couple of Tory backbenchers joined opposition MPs in expressing fears about
what the attack meant for the future role of the United Nations and for
relations with moderate Arab regimes.
But Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, insisted that the response to
the alleged plot to assassinate former US president Mr George Bush was
justified and proportionate. It had to be seen in the context of Iraq's
pattern of attempted defiance and obstruction of the international community
and its sponsoring of state terrorism.
Downing Street also emphasised that Mr John Major's response to news of the
impending attack had been to emphasise that it should be limited and
directed at those specifically implicated.
'Only through firmness can Iraq be persuaded to conform to the standards of
behaviour required of it by the international community,' he said.
Mr Hurd conceded the risk - raised by Mr Cyril Townsend, a leading figure in
the Conservative Middle East Council - that the attack would strengthen the
position of Islamic extremists. However, he believed that, as on previous
occasions, Arab critics in the coalition would feel safer and more satisfied
that the US had been prepared to show leadership.
The main charge from the opposition was that the attack had damaged the UN
and hopes of a post-cold war world order, since it could not properly be
based on article 51 of the United Nations charter.
Sir David Steel, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, said the
article was intended for use when there had been an attack on a UN member,
until the Security Council could act to restore peace.
But Mr Hurd argued that it allowed force to be used in self-defence against
threats to a country's nationals, and that Iraq's support for state
terrorism meant there was a constant threat of further attacks.
He urged the other parties not to adopt the rule that specific mandates had
to be sought from the United Nations when member nations were acting in
self-defence, since this would lead to a 'dangerous state of paralysis'.
Responding to MPs' concern about the three Britons held in prison in Iraq,
Mr Hurd insisted that the government was doing all it could to secure their
release.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Oil companies look west to a wild
frontier - A guarded optimism revealed by the latest batch of exploration
licences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN MR Tim Eggar, energy minister, awarded the latest batch of oil
exploration licences recently, he confirmed the trend for many companies to
look for oil in some of the less traditional areas around UK waters.
As the North Sea and the southern gas basin to the east of the country
approach maturity - which means they have been so heavily explored,
companies do not expect to make important discoveries there - the oil
industry is focusing more of its exploration work in waters to the west and
the south.
This has seen companies planning to explore west of Shetland, closer to
shore in the Irish channel, in Cardigan Bay and even in the south-western
approaches.
Mr Eggar is enthusiastic about this trend. 'I think we are on the verge of
proving up a major new oil province which is significant for the future of
the industry and UK oil production,' he said last week.
The government has particularly strong hopes for the west-of-Shetland area,
since several discoveries have been made there. 'It is yet more evidence
that the UK continental shelf continues to yield great benefits for the
economy,' Mr Eggar said.
But Mr Eggar is probably more enthusiastic than some in the oil industry,
who point to the enormous difficulties to be overcome before discoveries in
these 'frontier' waters can be turned into commercial production.
Mr Richard Hardman, exploration director at Amerada Hess which has made a
discovery of around 200m barrels of oil west of Shetland, says he is
optimistic but cautious. 'It's good to know there are big structures there
and large potential reserves, but there is a huge challenge to find the
technology and get it out at a reasonable cost.'
If companies can find sizeable amounts of oil to exploit, these new
provinces could prove extremely lucrative.
The proposed changes to Petroleum Revenue Taxes abolish tax on new fields,
whereas the rate for existing fields is 50 per cent. This gives an added
incentive to explore frontier waters.
Many of these 'new' areas have been explored before - the Clair field which
is estimated to contain 3bn barrels of oil was discovered in the region west
of Shetland 20 years ago. The field has never been exploited because of
complex geological problems associated with it and the lack of technology
for extracting the oil.
Improvements in technology for appraising and exploiting oil discoveries
could make some of these more marginal areas viable for the first time.
Nevertheless, it could be well into the next century before oil starts
flowing from the west of Shetland region, although the waters of Cardigan
Bay and the Irish channel could yield oil sooner.
However, companies hoping to find oil in Cardigan Bay must work within
strict environmental conditions. The area is one of great natural beauty and
has a resident population of bottlenose dolphins.
Environmentalists are threatening to challenge at an EC level the
government's award of licences in sensitive areas such as Cardigan Bay. They
say the licences could infringe EC environmental directives.
The drawbacks in the west-of-Shetland waters are more prosaic. The operating
conditions are among the harshest in the world because of the depth of the
water and the bad weather.
The water west of Shetland can be up to 6,000 ft deep, whereas the deepest
producing platform in the North Sea is in water 600 ft deep. The weather is
bad and companies are unable to gather seismic data needed for evaluating
oil discoveries in winter as they can in the North Sea. In addition, the
lack of infrastructure adds to the cost of development and production.
British Petroleum made an important discovery of between 250m and 500m
barrels of oil west of Shetland in March, which could cost Pounds 2bn to
develop.
'You might be able to use a floating production system to extract the oil
and then collect it in tankers,' said Ms Caroline Noble, industry analyst at
Wood MacKenzie in Edinburgh. 'But the weather is so bad, you probably
wouldn't be able to use it all year round.'
BP is conducting its largest-ever offshore seismic programme in waters west
of Shetland at a cost of Pounds 9.4m in order to gather more data on its
discovery and hopes to drill another well before the end of the year.
Mr Hardman points out that Amerada drilled 15 wells in this area before it
made a discovery. It lies in only 410 ft of water and should be easier to
exploit, but Mr Hardman is still cautious.
He was encouraged by the fast flow of oil from one well at a rate of 8,000
barrels a day. But Amerada plans to drill a couple more wells before it
decides whether the discovery can be exploited commercially - that decision
will be taken in 1995.
A group of companies is looking again at the Clair discovery in the hope of
establishing a development programme for that towards the end of the decade.
But the complexity of the field means that only 150m barrels from the 3bn in
place could be extracted.
In spite of the enormous challenges to be overcome in these areas, the
industry remains keen to search for oil which could be flowing well into the
21st century.

LABOUR yesterday attacked Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, as
'insincere and two-faced' over his plans to shake up the welfare state.
Shadow social security secretary Mr Donald Dewar said the end result of the
review of benefits would be 'a cut-price safety net with gaping holes
through lack of funding'.
Mr Dewar warned that Mr Lilley was looking to an American model, with more
restricted benefits.

On the fourth day of the committee stage, peers rejected by 207 to 30 a move
by Labour's Lord Bruce to exclude from EC competence 'a contribution to
education and training of quality and to the flowering of the cultures of

THE government is considering taking steps against the suppliers of the
Army's SA80 rifle, recently condemned by MPs on the cross-party defence
committee as 'verging on the shoddy', Viscount Cranborne, a junior defence
minister, said yesterday, Alison Smith writes.
'The question of liability is still under discussion,' he said, adding that
action against the company was a possibility.
The rifle, of which some 332,000 have been supplied or ordered, is made by
Royal Ordnance, which was sold to British Aerospace in 1987.
The defence committee's report listed 32 problems with the SA80, which came
into service in 1985.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories accused of double standards
on company links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR Research Department, the union-funded research organisation,
yesterday accused the government of double standards in dealing with
breaches of company law by companies with links to the Conservative party.
Focusing on the case of Hartley Investment Trust, an investment company
which has a senior Conservative MP on its board of directors, the
organisation asked whether there was 'one law for Tory MPs and another for
other company directors'. The authorities had failed over several years to
prosecute Hartley's directors in spite of the company's 'chequered' history
in breaking company law, it said.
According to the organisation, Hartley is so far 14 months late in filing
its accounts for the year to March 1991 at Companies House and five months
late in filing its 1992 accounts. Hartley filed its first three sets of
accounts on time but since 1987 accounts had been 'consistently' filed late,
the organisation said.
It said Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the powerful 1922 committee of
Conservative backbenchers, had been a Hartley director since January 1989.
Noting that Hartley gave more than Pounds 266,000 to the Conservatives or
Scottish Conservatives in the six years to 1990, the organisation reprinted
a direct-mailed letter from Mr Alan Lewis, the Hartley chairman, soliciting
donations for the 1987 election campaign.
'My purpose in writing to you is to seek your assistance . . . to raise
substantial funds to meet a special requirement of the Conservative party,'
the letter said.
'The funds raised will be directed at specific aspects of election
organisation and political campaigning by providing the constituencies with
modern technology and advanced management systems.'
Sir Marcus said yesterday he was satisfied Companies House was aware there
was 'a very good reason' for the delay in filing the accounts.
The company did not dispute it had filed the accounts late but said it had
acted 'in all propriety'.
Mr Lewis said the company had asked Peat Marwick, its auditor, to 'move
forward as quickly as possible to resolve these accounts'.
MPs last night approved new rules which will require them from next year to
make more detailed declarations of their outside interests such as company
directorships and membership of the Lloyd's of London insurance market.
Among the extra information MPs will now be expected to provide are details
of the Lloyd's syndicates to which they belong. In addition, MPs paid by
consultants will in future be required to list all clients to which they
have given services or advice, as well as the name of the consultancy.
In a short debate in the Commons Mr Tony Newton, leader of the House, said
he believed it would be right for MPs to accept the 'useful' improvements
proposed by the Commons committee on members' interests.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, the Labour party deputy leader, said she took the
'very strong' view that MPs owed the public its 'right of scrutiny' of
information on outside interests that ought properly to be available to
them.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: BR pressed over rolling stock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MacGregor, transport secretary, yesterday urged British Rail to
decide 'as quickly as possible' where new orders for rolling stock should be
placed.
BR is in the process of inviting tenders for supplying new rolling stock
financed by Pounds 150m of government money, Mr MacGregor told the Commons.
The Pounds 150m was made available for leasing new rolling stock or trains.
Mr Hugh Bayley (Lab York) called for a contract to be placed with Asea Brown
Boveri.
He said: 'This is the last surviving company in Britain that actually
manufactures railway body shells, and unless we get orders quickly it will
close.'
Mr Bayley warned that closure would mean importing railway body shells 'at
huge cost to the balance of payments'.
He said 532 jobs had been lost at ABB's plant in York due to a lack of
orders arising from the government's proposals for privatising BR.
Mr MacGregor replied that the redundancies were largely due to the
recession, rationalisation and the switching of priorities, and had nothing
to do with the planned privatisation of the network.
He said there had been a 'huge improvement' in productivity since ABB
entered the private sector so that it now had improved opportunities for
securing overseas orders.
Sir Roger Moate (C Faversham) suggested that the Pounds 150m should be seen
as the first stage in a continuing ordering programme.
Mr MacGregor refused to predict the outcome of negotiations over the level
of public expenditure in future years, and added that he hoped
private-sector finance would be available for the leasing market.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Unions cool on Scargill threat to
Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ARTHUR SCARGILL, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, was
isolated by trade unionists yesterday after threatening that Labour's
attempts to reform its links with the union movement could lead to the
setting up of a new political party.
Speaking at his union's annual conference in Scarborough, Mr Scargill said
that if the Labour leader persisted with attempts to diminish the role and
influence of trade unions in the party there was 'a real risk that trade
unions - or some of them - may decide it is time to conceive a new party
which will give the same unequivocal commitment in parliament to our class
that the Tory Party gives to its own.'
Trade unions, he said, should be seeking to strengthen, not weaken the
influence and effectiveness of trade unions inside the Labour party.
Other trade unions - even those opposed to the reforms proposed by Mr John
Smith, Labour leader - quickly distanced themselves from Mr Scargill's
remarks.
His proposals were not taken seriously either by the Labour leadership, with
one official dismissing him as 'an isolated individual.'
The schism has historical parallels - the Miners Federation eschewed links
with the Labour Representation Committee, the precursor to the Labour party,
for almost a decade after its formation in 1900. The miners' union then
sponsored its own MPs.
But yesterday other trade unions reiterated their commitment to the existing
Labour party. A spokesman for the GMB union, whose leader Mr John Edmunds
has been critical of Mr Smith's leadership, said Mr Scargill's remarks were
'unhelpful' and divisive.
Nupe, the public service union, said it was happy that its views were voiced
through Labour's ruling National Executive Committee. 'I think that we would
probably want to distance ourselves from it (Mr Scargill's speech) at the
moment,' said a spokesman.
A spokesman for RMT, the transport union, said there would have to be
'massive changes' for it to abandon the existing Labour party. Mr Jimmy
Knapp, RMT general secretary, told the union's annual conference yesterday
that he supported Labour's existing shadow cabinet, 'warts and all'. The
Trades Union Congress said yesterday it was opposed to any takeover of
privatised pits by Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate. The TUC also said it
would be mounting a campaign of 'political and social pressure' to draw
attention to action in the US by the United Mine Workers of America and
Canada. UMWA is striking in the US against the Hanson subsidiary, Peabody,
over job security.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Scargill claims British Coal's pits
need not be closed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR SCARGILL yesterday claimed that all of British Coal's pits could remain
open for the next 20 years if the money spent on redundancies and colliery
closures had been invested in the industry.
The National Union of Mineworkers' president said care and maintenance costs
at pits where production has ended, coupled with payment of wages to miners
'prevented' from cutting coal, has cost Pounds 450m since last October.
'If this sum together with Pounds 1bn earmarked by Michael Heseltine for
redundancies had been made available to the coal industry to preserve rather
than destroy jobs, it would ensure that all of British Coal's 51 pits remain
open for the next 20 years,' Mr Scargill said.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Action considered over problem
rifle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is considering taking steps against the suppliers of the
Army's SA80 rifle, recently condemned by MPs on the cross-party defence
committee as 'verging on the shoddy', Viscount Cranborne, a junior defence
minister, said yesterday.
'The question of liability is still under discussion,' he said, adding that
action against the company was a possibil-ity.
The rifle, of which some 332,000 have been supplied or ordered, is made by
Royal Ordnance, which was sold to British Aerospace in 1987.
The defence committee's report listed 32 problems with the SA80, which came
into service in 1985. These included: poor performance in desert conditions;
most left-handed soldiers could not fire it; trigger mechanisms tended to
stick; firing pins broke; bayonets snapped off; and the cleaning kit was
'inadequate'.
Lord Cranborne told peers: 'There were defects in the rifle as originally
supplied - a greater number of defects than we would like to accept.'
But he insisted that, in spite of these, 'by the time it was in service in
the Gulf, properly cleaned, it was clear that its performance was at least
equal to other rifles in use'.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pits 'could have been kept open'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ARTHUR Scargill yesterday claimed that all of British Coal's pits could
remain open for the next 20 years if the money spent on redundancies and
colliery closures had been invested in the industry.
The National Union of Mineworkers' president said care and maintenance costs
at pits where production has ended, coupled with payment of wages to miners
'prevented' from cutting coal, has cost Pounds 450m since last October.
'If this sum together with Pounds 1bn earmarked by Michael Heseltine for
redundancies had been made available to the coal industry to preserve rather
than destroy jobs, it would ensure that all of British Coal's 51 pits remain
open for the next 20 years,' Mr Scargill told the NUM's annual conference in
Scarborough.
He attacked the TUC and the Labour leadership for 'refusing' to support
direct action against pit closures.
'We have won the argument hands-down and yet this government has remained
impervious to logic.''
Mr Scargill told delegates it was 'vitally important' that the NUM continued
to fight to re-open closed pits and to win back the thousands of jobs lost
in recent weeks.
He told the conference the NUM has paid Pounds 5.5m in severance pay to its
own staff and members because of the pit closure programme.
'While British Coal has received money from the government and the EC to
fully fund its severance arrangements, the NUM has not received a penny.'
The European Commission has said the NUM should get a refund from the
government out of European funds for the mining industry, he said.
Mr Scargill later confirmed the union was set to move its headquarters from
Sheffield to the Yorkshire area offices in Barnsley because of a cutback in
staff caused by the pit closure programme.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CENTRAL spending on the Citizen's Charter was Pounds 2.14m last year, the
government said in the Commons yesterday.
Mr William Waldegrave, the Citizen's Charter minister, gave the 1992-93
figures in a question time clash with Mr Tony Banks (Lab Newham NW).
Mr Waldegrave said the spending was Pounds 1.6m in 1991-92. Other costs were
reflected under individual public services' figures, he added.
So far 32 Charters have been produced with one planned this year for further
and higher education students.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major upbeat on return of Heseltine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prime minister 'hopes and expects' that Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, will resume his political career after he recovers from
last week's heart attack, Downing Street said, Ralph Atkins writes.
Mr John Major's optimism appeared to rule out the appointment of a
replacement at the Department of Trade and Industry. Mr Tim Sainsbury, the
industry minister, will continue to stand in for Mr Heseltine at cabinet
meetings.
However no timetable has yet been set for Mr Heseltine's return to the
political mainstream and Downing Street said it may be some while. The
expectation at Westminster is that Mr Heseltine will convalesce until the
Conservative's annual conference begins in October.
Consultants at the Harley Street clinic where Mr Heseltine is staying
yesterday also expressed confidence that he was making a good recovery. A
statement said: 'Mr Heseltine spent a quiet weekend and continues to make
good progress.' Further tests are likely be carried out on Mr Heseltine
later this week.

FT  29 JUN 93 / BT restricts access to pornographic phone lines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALLERS to pornographic 0898 phonelines will soon need a personal
identification number (PIN) to listen in, British Telecommunications said
yesterday.
The Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone
Information Services also plans to restrict the advertising of adult
services to 'top-shelf' publications.
The measures reflect growing concern about children calling the adult lines,
often as a result of advertisements in newspapers or magazines.
Adult phone lines are produced and managed by independent operators using
lines leased from BT. Premium-rate charges are 48p a minute at peak time and
36p off-peak, of which 28p goes to the operator.
The PIN requirement will be introduced in July next year, when direct access
to all adult services on lines with the prefixes 0898, 0338 and 08364 will
be blocked.
Customers who wish to access them will be issued with a security PIN. Their
calls will be billed to their BT account, regardless of where they make the
call. It will not be possible to call the lines from public phoneboxes or
old-style dial phones without a Pounds 9.95 tone-pad, which simulates the
tones of a modern touchphone.
BT said that its market research showed that more than 90 per cent of
customers supported an opt-in for adult services. It already offers
customers the opportunity to bar premium-rate calls on their phones.
More than 700,000 calls a week are made to recorded and live adult phone
lines. One in seven of all complaints received by the ICSTIS watchdog last
year concerned such lines.
Information and entertainment services on 0891 numbers will not be affected.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Reuters 'warned of RSI danger'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REUTERS news agency, the employer of a journalist who lost his job after
developing repetitive strain injury (RSI), had been warned beforehand of the
health risks of new computer technology, the High Court was told yesterday.
Yet Reuters did nothing about the problem until Mr Rafiq Mughal began
suffering from RSI, the court heard.
Mr Mughal is suing his former employer for compensation in a test case that
could have widespread implications for other journalists and users of
computer keyboards. Reuters denies liability.
Mr Mughal was employed by Reuters between September 1987 and December 1989
and developed RSI when he became chief sub-editor on the equities desk, Mr
John Foy, his counsel, said.
Mr Mughal, whose action is backed by the National Union of Journalists, had
spent all his working time using a computer keyboard, and his case was that
this had caused him to suffer injury.
He has not worked for the past four years and says he has lost more than
Pounds 85,000 in salary. He is claiming compensation for pain and suffering
as well as loss of earnings.
A central issue was the extent to which Mr Mughal's keyboard work caused his
injury, Mr Foy said.
The case continues.

FT  29 JUN 93 / MP urges refit work for Swan Hunter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT's promise last week to Rosyth naval dockyard of 12 years'
work on warship refits yesterday prompted a call for a guaranteed programme
of work for Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership.
Mr Nick Brown, Labour MP for Newcastle East, last night tabled Commons
questions urging the award to Swan Hunter of a core programme of refits.
Mr Brown said the promise to the Scottish yard of warship work until 2005
had signalled a 'substantial change in what we understood the marketplace to
be'. He added: 'If it's ideologically sound for Devonport and Rosyth to have
core programmes promised, then it must be right for Tyneside.'
Mr Brown said he was not calling for a large programme for Swan Hunter, but
for a 'statement of faith' in it from the government. Three refits are due
to be offered for tender this year or early next year, he said. Awarding
these now to Swan Hunter would be a lifeline, he added.
Reacting to Mr Brown's call, the Ministry of Defence said that last week's
announcement for Rosyth and Devonport was made to confirm the future of the
two dockyards. 'We are running the defence of the realm, not a business of
trying to ensure the future of warship yards,' the department said.

FT  29 JUN 93 / 100-channel TV mooted: Digital broadcasting technology set
to transform viewing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK could have as many as 100 television channels without the need for
cable or satellite by using digital technology, the Independent Television
Commission said yesterday.
Such a large number would only be possible, however, if digital broadcasts
from existing transmitters replaced the PAL broadcasts of the four
television channels. PAL is the present analogue broadcasting system used in
the UK.
Introducing a discussion document on digital television yesterday, Mr Peter
Rogers, ITC deputy chief executive, warned that a notice period of at least
10 years would be needed before existing PAL transmissions could be
discontinued.
'Black boxes' would be needed to convert the digital signal and the
commission accepts that it is unrealistic suddenly to tell viewers they will
need a box if they want to continue watching.
Because of the complexity of the issues, the commission favours a gradual
introduction of digital technology with a combination of simulcast - the
retransmission in digital form of the existing channels - plus new services.
In some areas of the country, as many as 20 extra channels of television
could be provided digitally over existing channels in addition to the four
PAL channels - BBC1, BBC2, ITV and Channel 4. However, mainly because of
congestion of PAL frequencies this would be much lower in some of the most
lucrative television areas in the south and south-east.
In some areas there would not be enough spare capacity to simulcast the four
national channels in digital.
'It would be very difficult to go ahead without at least a European standard
in place (for the black box),' Mr Rogers said yesterday.
Yesterday's document states the enormous potential in digital technology for
transforming television.
The commission suggests that the move to terrestrial digital broadcasting
could allow many more viewing options such as channels which concentrate on
comedy in peak time, and others which concentrate on current affairs.
Several channels could be devoted to a football match and viewers could
choose which camera angle to watch from. Channels could be set aside for
more regional news.
The commission will publish a paper on the future of Channel 5 next month
and digital use will be one of the options.
The first full use of digital in Europe is likely to be by FilmNet, the
satellite company broadcasting pay-television to the Benelux countries.

FT  29 JUN 93 / BBC's support services face market testing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC will today tell staff that it is moving to a system of market
testing in non-programme making areas such as the management of buildings,
training and transport services.
The aim is to ensure value for money in the corporation's support services
and that the maximum amount of funds goes to programme making.
Market testing, which will become a continual process, will be carried out
by individual BBC departments. It will involve competitive tenders being
sought for work at present done in-house and the possibility of entire areas
of work going to outside contractors.
Mr Michael Starks, controller of BBC services, said yesterday that he
expected the main impact to come from the non-programme-related service
departments reassessing the demand for what they offer following the
introduction of theProducer Choice policy last April. Under this policy
programme producers are able to buy in services from outside the
corporation.
Producers who now have to pay for everything at full cost are trying to
reduce what they pay in overheads.
Mr Starks confirmed that competitive tendering would be used and that
further contracting out of services was a possibility. One area likely to
receive a close look will be buildings management.
Mr Starks insisted that the market-testing exercise was not designed to
reduce the size of the BBC. 'It is about demonstrable value for money for
the licence-payer,' he said.
The result of both a decline in demand for support services at the BBC and
market testing will almost inevitably lead to fewer staff jobs at the
corporation.
BBC staff will also be told that the corporation will help to protect the
terms and conditions of staff whose work goes to private operators in line
with the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations.

FT  29 JUN 93 / High-tech future for rustic town
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SMALL town of Kington in Hereford &amp; Worcester is to become the
'high-tech' rural community of the future.
It has been selected for a national pilot scheme to study the impact that
state-of-the-art technology can have on the economic and social fabric of
small towns and villages.
The Kington Connected Community project will be sponsored by the government
and private and public-sector partners.
It will be monitored over a 12-month period by the Henley Centre, the social
and economic research company.
Kington, close to the Welsh border, has a population of 2,200 and serves an
agricultural area of 150 square miles.
During the next few months it will receive communications and computer
equipment worth more than Pounds 250,000, as well as financial support to
establish a 'telecentre' and provide training for business and computing
skills.
The Department of Trade and Industry, British Telecommunications, Apple
Computer and the Rural Development Commission are the lead partners in the
pilot scheme, which was awarded to Kington after competitive bids from a
number of other towns.
Kington will be equipped with a 'telecentre' and a 'town area network'. The
'telecentre' will contain about 15 Apple computers, plus high-speed data
links, teleconferencing facilities, and software for a wide range of
established and start-up businesses.
Kington's businesses, schools, clubs, tourist information office and shops
will be offered equipment linked to a local telecommunications network. This
will be upgraded by a connection to BT's ISDN2 service to give enhanced
data-transfer capacity.
Projects planned range from providing a common administrative back-up system
for five local primary schools to the provision of a single stock-control
system for a chain of three sports shops run from the town.
Mr Miles Swinburne, a local construction manager who helped put together
Kington's bid, said: 'People can see the writing on the wall for communities
like ours, and they want to use modern communications to do something about
it.'
The aim, he said, was to protect existing community activities and attract
new businesses to the town.
'We don't only want 'teleworkers' who want to work from the country, but
small high-tech companies run by people brought up in the area but who have
been sucked into the south-east because of the perception of remoteness and
inadequate communications,' he said.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Axing Thorp could cost Pounds 5bn, Eggar warns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPENSATION to power utilities could amount to Pounds 5bn if the UK
abandoned Thorp, the controversial nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield,
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, told MPs yesterday.
But as the government threw its weight behind the Pounds 2.8bn plant in
yesterday's House of Commons debate, it also announced a further round of
public consultation on Thorp, delaying a final decision on its future until
late autumn.
The government's assessment could be complicated by the publication
yesterday of a long-awaited report from a government advisory committee
which argues that British Nuclear Fuels has not adequately explained its
plans to store foreign waste in the UK permanently.
The Radioactive Waste Management Advisory committee said there were many
questions still to be answered about BNF's proposed policy of
'substitution'. Under this plan, bulky low-level and intermediate-level
waste produced by Thorp will be stored permanently in Britain while BNF
would return to customers a smaller amount of high-level waste equivalent in
terms of radioactivity.
'The profitability of Thorp would be considerably enhanced if substitution
were to be accepted,' the report says.
If the government followed the committee's recommendations, that could add
months more to a debate about licensing the plant.
BNF's plant, which environmentalists have dubbed Britain's biggest white
elephant, is waiting for a licence from the Department of the Environment to
start operation. The company has warned that further delay could force it to
shed staff to help cut costs of Pounds 2.4m a week.
Mr Eggar attacked a Liberal Democrat proposal yesterday for a fuller public
inquiry into Thorp, saying it would lead to 'a loss of confidence' by
overseas investors who have funded much of the plant's construction. A
number of Thorp's customers had 'shown interest' in signing additional
contracts beyond the initial 10 years, he suggested.
Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, said there was
growing concern about proliferation of uranium and plutonium produced by
reprocessing.
The government's proposed 10-week consultation will begin in late July with
the publication of a report setting out the case for the plant. The
attorney-general told the government last month it ran the risk of a
judicial review prompted by legal action from pressure groups if it did not
consider the wider issues.
Mr Chris Smith, a Labour frontbench environment spokesman, yesterday accused
the government of prejudging its own consultation. Ministers were saying 'we
have made up our mind but we are going to consult because legally we have to
be seen to do so', he said.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said yesterday that the public
consultation, the second on the plant, would look at the wider economic and
political justification for it, but environmental factors had been
adequately addressed by the pollution inspectorate's report on the first
public consultation.
Thorp is designed to extract reusable uranium and plutonium from used or
spent nuclear fuel, leaving less true waste. BNF's contracts allow it return
all reprocessed material to foreign customers.
The committee is concerned that BNF has not yet agreed the details of
substitution with its foreign customers, mainly Japanese and German nuclear
power utilities.
It adds that substitution could be threatened if the nuclear industry's
proposal to build an underground store for radioactive waste deep under
Sellafield is delayed.
BNF said last night: 'We are considering the government's statement.' It
intends to reply today.

FT  29 JUN 93 / City watchdogs oppose disclosure moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECURITIES and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, has joined
forces with the two self-regulating bodies for the life insurance industry
to oppose tough disclosure rules proposed by the Office of Fair Trading.
SIB, Lautro, the organisation for the life insurance industry, and Fimbra,
the body for independent financial advisers, are urging the Treasury to
reject the recommendation that independent financial advisers be required to
disclose the amount of commission they will earn from prospective customers.
They are also opposing the Office of Fair Trading's proposal that life
insurers spell out projected surrender values year-by-year on policies.
The move underlines the retreat by Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, who six
months ago said he favoured requiring life insurance companies to tell
prospective customers more about the products they buy.
But two weeks ago Mr Large told the Commons Treasury and Civil Service
committee that he opposed the disclosure rules and favoured those proposed
by his predecessor, Sir David Walker. The Office of Fair Trading has already
said that Sir David's proposed rules contained seriously anti-competitive
elements that should be changed.
The OFT has submitted a report to the Treasury, which is still considering
the subject of disclosure for the sale of life insurance products.
The three regulatory organisations, however, have apparently accepted the
OFT's view that companies should be required to disclose their own charges
in illustrating returns for prospective customers rather than be allowed to
use industry average costs.
But the three oppose the OFT recommendation for 'differential pricing'. That
means that low-cost sales outlets such as building societies could charge
less for a life insurance policy sold by a direct sales agent of the same
insurance provider.

THE British Medical Association yesterday decided to relax its opposition to
general-practitioner fundholding, the most controversial aspect of the
government's National Health Service reforms.
While the association continues to believe that fund-holding has led to the
development of a two-tier health service, its annual representative meeting
in Torquay yesterday voted 189 to 140 for a motion declaring that 'given the
present reality' the association should no longer assert its opposition to
the scheme.
Twenty-five per cent of general practitioners are now in fundholding
practices and this is likely to rise to around 40 per cent next year. In
these circumstances the association would have been able to maintain
entrenched opposition only at the expense of dividing its own membership.
Fundholders have budgets from which they purchase hospital and other care on
behalf of their patients. There have been allegations that hospitals have
sometimes given preference to fundholders' patients on financial rather than
clinical grounds. Even some supporters of the scheme accept that it can
distort local health spending priorities.
But Dr John Rae, a member of the association's council who moved the
successful motion, told the conference that fundholding had become a reality
and by 'stating implausible opposition' the association implied that it
would not talk about the scheme. Fundholding affected all GPs, he said, and
the association had to be involved in negotiations on the issues it raised
for all its members.
While the decision will be welcomed by the government, it does not indicate
a collapse of the association's hostility to the health reforms. There is a
growing feeling in the association that the warnings it sounded when the
reforms were introduced in 1991 are being proved correct.
Dr Jeremy Lee-Potter, chairman of the association's council, said in his
opening speech to the conference: 'We did not believe that the government
would make enough money available to solve the widespread problems that were
bound to appear. The government has not provided enough money and the
problems have appeared.'
Large industrial organisations, he said, now recognised that structures
based on co-operation and teamwork were best, adding that the co-operation
in the health service was being lost by the commercial competition at the
heart of the reforms.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Cuts in sick pay considered by employers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY one in five companies are considering cuts in pay for employees who
are off work because of sickness, according to a survey of personnel
managers in 500 organisations published today.
The survey, conducted by the magazine Personnel Today, found that banking,
finance and public-sector organisations are most likely to be considering
cutting sick-pay schemes, with 26 per cent in those sectors saying that they
might reduce benefits within the next two years.
A Confederation of British Industry study earlier this year concluded that
UK employers lost Pounds 13bn a year through sickness absence. It found that
a full-time manual worker takes an average of 10 days' sick leave a year and
non-manual workers take five to six days.
The Institute of Personnel Management said yesterday that larger companies
typically paid up to six months' salary to employees who were certified as
long-term sick, with more generous schemes paying for a year's absence from
work.
However, rather than considering cutting these long-term schemes, many
employers were examining ways of controlling the number of short-term
absences within their companies, said the institute. Some organisations were
setting targets of, for example, eight days or less sick leave a year for
individuals, and were then docking pay on a sliding scale for time taken off
beyond that point.
The magazine's survey found that 9 per cent of organisations had already
made cuts in sick-pay schemes, most of them in the public sector.
Some local authorities, in particular, have suffered from high rates of
absenteeism and the Audit Commission has recently focused on the ways local
government can tighten up on the amount of sick leave taken by workers.
The magazine reports that 'company sick pay did look to be under threat
earlier this year when two major employers announced plans to slash schemes.
Electrical goods manufacturer Hoover introduced two-year contracts with no
sick-pay entitlement. High-street bank Barclays planned to cut the length of
sick pay for most staff but eventually restricted the cuts to new staff.'

FT  29 JUN 93 / Body Shop claims 'libel' cut profits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A TELEVISION programme that questioned the commitment to animal welfare of
The Body Shop, the natural toiletries and cosmetics group, cost the company
Pounds 463,000, the High Court was told yesterday.
Mr Gordon Roddick, The Body Shop chairman, and Mrs Anita Roddick, managing
director, are suing Channel 4 and Fulcrum Productions for libel over the
programme broadcast in the Dispatches series last year.
Cross-examined by Mr Richard Rampton QC, for the defendants, Mr Roddick said
pre-tax profits for the first six months of the 1992-93 financial year were
Pounds 930,000 lower than the previous year. He said the company was
claiming that Pounds 463,000 in lost profits - including Pounds 360,000 from
that period - was attributable to the programme.
The defendants deny libel. The hearing was adjourned until today.

MR GEORGE WALKER, the former chairman of Brent Walker, was told yesterday he
cannot proceed with his appeal against bankruptcy unless he puts up Pounds
18,000 in advance to cover part of his opponent's legal costs should the
move fail.
The Court of Appeal granted the 'security for costs' order to Mr Raymond
Hocking of accountants Stoy Hayward who obtained the bankruptcy ruling
against Mr Walker in April.
The order was made because Mr Walker failed to honour his obligations to
creditors under the voluntary arrangement supervised by Mr Hocking.

FT  29 JUN 93 / High loan scheme take-up expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER BANKING CORRESPONDENT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS EXPECT the reformed version of the government's Loan Guarantee Scheme
to attract greater involvement from both borrowers and lenders when it is
launched this week.
The British Bankers' Association yesterday said the scheme, which extends
the maximum loan for existing businesses from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds
250,000, would probably be attractive to companies trying to obtain debt to
trade into recovery.
Sir Nicholas Goodison, president of the association, said banks were
expecting 'some lively business' from the revised scheme, under which the
government guarantees banks against defaults on loans by small businesses.
Banks have been criticised for lending too little under the 12-year-old
scheme, although they argue that they have only responded to a lack of
demand. Banks are only allowed to use the scheme if they have exhausted
alternatives.
Mr Stuart White, chairman of the association's small-business committee,
said it was hard to predict the level of demand for the revised scheme.
However, he said the changes would make it particularly relevant for
companies emerging from recession.
Mr White said the scheme was likely to 'come into its own perfectly well'
for companies whose equity capital had been reduced by trading in recession
and were now seeking loan capital in order to finance increased orders.
Banks have yet to disclose the terms on which they will offer fixed-rate
loans when the revised scheme comes into effect on Thursday. The revisions
announced in the last Budget include the introduction of fixed-rate finance.
The altered scheme prohibits loans being offered to 'local service'
businesses such as small retailers, although 23 per cent of the Pounds 1.2bn
lent so far has gone to such enterprises.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Power chiefs take large pay rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHIEF executives of National Power and PowerGen, the generating
companies, received substantial pay awards last year, according to accounts
released yesterday.
Mr John Baker, who runs National Power, had his basic pay increased from
Pounds 246,250 to Pounds 267,750. In addition he received a Pounds 64,260
performance-related bonus. Including other benefits and pensions his package
totalled Pounds 393,803, an increase of 6.2 per cent on the previous year.
Mr Baker was also granted a further 93,525 share options at 264p a share.
The annual report says that Mr Baker's bonus followed a year in which the
total return to shareholders including capital gains and dividends, was 84
per cent. National Power shares closed at 368p last night, up from 242p a
year ago.
Mr Ed Wallis of PowerGen received a 10.2 per cent rise in his basic pay to
Pounds 312,802, and his total package including benefits and pensions rose
to Pounds 362,476.
The average rise for National Power employees from January 1 was 3.95 per
cent for a 15-month period. PowerGen workers last year got a flat 5.5 per
cent increase, while for this year they have accepted a 2.5 per cent rise
plus one-off lump sums related to productivity.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Iraq exports advice 'deficient'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIVIL SERVANTS across three Whitehall departments secretly justified the
export of machine tools to Iraq in breach of the government's own publicly
declared guidelines, the Scott inquiry heard yesterday.
Documents shown to the inquiry showed that the officials told ministers that
exports to Iraq did not breach the guidelines.
An internal memo written for Mr David Mellor, then the junior Foreign Office
minister, by Mr William Patey, a Foreign Office official who was chairman of
the Whitehall Inter-departmental Committee, argued that if existing export
licences for machine tools were revoked, the government could face legal
action from the companies concerned.
Yesterday Mr Patey admitted to the inquiry that the Foreign Office had never
taken legal advice on the issue.
The memo added that the machinery was 'not technically defence-related' and
that not to carry out the contracts would mean Britain's foreign competitors
stepping in.
Mr Patey told the inquiry that advice given by civil servants to ministers
on the export of UK machine tools in January 1988 was 'deficient' in that it
glossed over the extent to which they might have contravened declared
policy. 'The advice could have been clearer . . . It could have been better
put,' he said.
It emerged yesterday that the memo was written after the Foreign Office had
apparently spent two months ignoring specific information it had received
from SIS (MI6) that Iraq was building up its indigenous arms manufacturing
capability after signing contracts with Matrix Churchill and other UK
British machine tool companies.
The government's guidelines restricted the export of defence-related
equipment that could significantly enhance the capability of both Iraq and
Iran to exacerbate the Gulf conflict.
Documents referred to yesterday show the selective use that was made within
Whitehall of additional information made available to government officials.
This was that one of the machine tool companies, Matrix Churchill, was being
encouraged to trade with Iraq as a way of providing intelligence.
The bulk of these documents were released after the collapse in November of
the controversial trial of three former Matrix Churchill executives which
led to the setting up of Lord Justice Scott's inquiry.
The executives had been arrested for breaching export controls. However it
emerged during the trial that they had been deliberately encouraged by
officials to conceal that they knew the machine tools were being put to a
military use.
The inquiry continues tomorrow, with evidence from Mr David James, chairman
of Eagle Trust, and Mr Robin Fellgett, a Treasury official.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Regional differences give new lease of life to commercial
property: There are wide variations in how the market is responding to the
upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS EVIDENCE mounts that the commercial property market may have turned the
corner, wide variations are appearing in the behaviour of different sectors
and regions.
Differences arise also in the behaviour of the two factors that underpin
property values: rents and investment yields. So far, the improvement in
values results entirely from a fall in yields of other investments as
investors return to the property market. Rents are still falling, albeit at
a slowing rate, reflecting the weakness of tenant demand.
Yet some trends are gradually emerging.
Property in London and the south-east, the first markets to move into
recession, may be showing the strongest signs of improvement. The
north-south divide, whereby northern property has markedly outperformed that
in the south during the recession, is being reversed.
Mr Tim Stevenson of Chesterton, property advisers, said there were signs of
'a ripple effect' - changes in London are spreading gradually through the
rest of the country.
The effect is partly attributed to the metropolitan bias of decisionmakers,
but it also reflects the disproportionate fall in rents seen in London,
where office costs have fallen by more than half - compared with falls of 5
per cent in the midlands and the north.
That has removed much of the incentive for companies to move out of London -
and had a knock-on effect on rental values outside London. Relocation has
slowed from its peak in 1991, when 36 organisations and 13,867 office jobs
moved out of central London. Only nine moves are scheduled for this year and
only five for the period 1994-96.
There is more to the regional pattern of the property recovery than the
'ripple effect', though. While in London and the south-east, surplus
property will continue to restrain rent increases for some time, elsewhere
that is not the case.
In north-east England, the 1980s boom never developed to a point where the
market became glutted with new property. Mr Mark Finch of Sanderson Townend
&amp; Gilbert, surveyors, said that had put the market in a stronger position
should demand recover. He added: 'There is less available space, so if there
is a gradual recovery it has a more marked effect.'
Moreover, the smaller decline in rents outside the south-east makes it
easier for expanding companies to move into new space. In oversupplied
markets such as London offices, companies are often locked into their
existing leases because they cannot find another tenant to take their place.
The different segments of the market are developing in their own ways. In
the north-east, for instance, retail property is generally performing well,
but there is a mood of despondency about industrial property. 'The knock-on
effect of the Swan Hunter receivership will put back recovery across the
north-east,' Mr Finch said.
In north-west England, it is the office market that is still under pressure,
with industrial property over the worst, according to Lambert Smith Hampton,
surveyors. In the south-west, there has been a marked increase in inquiries
for industrial property, but concern about unemployment is depressing retail
property, according to Chesterton.
Looking at the country as a whole, however, there is a consensus that retail
property will lead the recovery. Investors certainly think that way: in
1992, 87 per cent of institutional net investment went into the retail
sector, according to the Investment Property Databank, a research group.
According to Hillier Parker, the chartered surveyors that published a report
last week saying that property values were starting to edge upwards, the
proportion of empty property in the retail sector is less than 2 per cent,
compared with nearly 6 per cent for the property market as a whole.
There is little consensus about industrial property. In the past year, the
office market has posted a worse performance than industrial property, with
rent declines of 17 per cent and 8 per cent respectively, according to
Hillier Parker. Retail rents, by contrast, fell on average by 3.4 per cent.
Some analysts expect industrial property to perform better than offices
because the effects of the devaluation of sterling will benefit exporters.
The biggest influence for users of offices may be the attempts of many
service industries to cut their payrolls and raise productivity.
But it is the office sector, not the industrial sector, that has seen an
improvement in yields. Some agents, such as Mr John Heawood of DTZ Debenham
Thorpe, who chairs the Society of Business and Industrial Agents, believe
that the strength of the industrial market compared with the provincial
office market is exaggerated. 'In general, the recovery is patchy,' he said.
Mr Heawood's caution about tenant demand is echoed by several regional
agents, who are pointing to a weak and fragmented recovery. The enthusiasm
for property shown by investors is not yet matched by a revival in the
letting market.

</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US has warned Japan that their economic relationship could become
increasingly fraught, straining their security alliance, unless Japan
responds to Washington's proposals for a framework for further detailed
trade talks.
A senior US administration official, speaking after two days of talks in
Tokyo ended without agreement, indicated that the US would start to take a
firmer approach, and warned Japan that the entire relationship was at stake.
He said: 'The relationship as it stands is corroded. The corrosive effects
of limited market access and the corrosive effects of Japan's large current
account surplus will exacerbate an already difficult bilateral
relationship.'
The official was reflecting mounting frustration with Japan's refusal to
accept numerical measures of the openness of its market.
He said the issue was not whether the US would threaten to use sanctions in
particular areas: 'The real issue is the long-term quality of the
relationship.'
It is almost certain that the US and Japan will not meet the original goals
set by President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa at their
April summit.
Two days of negotiations in Tokyo ended last night with the US team
exhausted and Japan vehemently opposed to targets for opening the Japanese
market.
The two sides have little disagreement over the five baskets of issues which
the US has proposed for discussion, covering areas such as trade in vehicle
parts and supercomputers as well as macro-economic imbalances.
But Japan is opposed to a specific target for a swift reduction of the
current account surplus. The difference between the two sides on this issue
is mainly one of how quickly the surplus is reduced.

FT  29 JUN 93 / World Trade News: State sector leads Singapore in the
scramble for China - The focus is on infrastructure projects management and
on advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINGAPORE is both winning and losing the race to invest in China. The island
is successfully carving out a niche for itself as China's leading adviser in
many areas. It is managing multi-million dollar infrastructure projects and
advising China on economic and financial matters.
But so far it has bitten off only a small slice of the China investment
cake.
According to official Chinese figures, Singapore companies became involved
in more than 700 projects in China in 1992, with a total value of USDollars
997m (Pounds 664m).
The figures are small compared with those of Hong Kong and Taiwan. Last year
alone Taiwan is estimated to have invested Dollars 5bn in China.
Singapore's economic success has been built on the twin pillars of foreign
multinationals and efficiently run, powerful, state companies. Singapore's
private sector, grown fat on profits at home, has only recently started to
expand overseas.
It is the Singapore government rather than the private sector which is
leading the rush to China. Two recent deals demonstrate the Singapore
approach:
In mid-May the Singapore authorities and China signed a provisional
agreement to develop a 70 sq km industrial township in Suzhou, near
Shanghai. Called 'Singapore II' by the Singaporean press, the township will
be built with Singapore's integrated planning approach.
Chinese officials will be seconded to Singapore government departments and
taught the island republic's planning methods. Singapore managers will
oversee work on the project, organising a expected Dollars 20bn of
investments in the new town.
Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's senior minister, played a key role in the
Suzhou deal. Mr Lee says Singapore will not only build up goodwill through
the project, it will also make the connections (guanxi)so necessary to
winning further contracts.
'If we transfer this asset over seven to 10 years, it will be useful to them
and in the process we will get to know them well at different levels. . .
That's the trade-off,' says Mr Lee.
Last December two state-controlled Singapore companies, Singapore
Technologies Industrial and Jurong Environmental Engineering, entered into
agreements with the Chinese authorities to help develop and market a 5,000ha
commercial, industrial and residential complex in Fujian province.
The first phase of the scheme will cost about Dollars 185m. Again the hope
is that in the course of the project, Singapore companies will win lucrative
contracts.
Similar deals have been signed for a variety of other schemes, involving
airport planning, road construction, and property development.
China has been tapping Singapore expertise in other fields. More than 200
Chinese delegations have visited Singapore in the past year.
In some respects Singapore represents a model for China's planners. It is an
open and successful market economy within a tightly controlled, centralised
political system.
Mr Goh Keng Swee, a former Singapore finance minister, has been acting as an
economic adviser to China since 1985. Mr Goh played a central role in
Singapore's planning process in the 1960s and 1970s, setting up the island
republic's Economic Development Board, the Monetary Authority of Singapore
and other key institutions.
Bankers say it is clear that the MAS is playing an important role advising
China's central bank, the People's Bank of China.
The Singapore government is investing in companies with close China
connections. It recently took a 12.5 per cent stake in New China Hong Kong
Group, a company based in the colony, said to have close links with the
Chinese leadership.
Mr Lee and other Singapore leaders say the government cannot always be
expected to take the lead in establishing China contacts. They chastise
Singapore's business community for its paucity of overseas investment.
'No one wants to go abroad. . . We have got to shake Singaporeans up, make
them adventurous, or we will be losers.' says Mr Lee.
Mr Lee himself is blamed for fostering a risk-averse culture in Singapore.
Critics say that by building up an over-regulated, carefully controlled
society, the entrepreneur - so evident in Taiwan and Hong Kong - has been
squeezed out of Singapore.
Some elderly Singaporean businessmen have retained close China links, based
on family and dialect groups.
'Most of the young Singaporeans are no good at China business,' says an
older Singapore trader with close connections in Shanghai. 'They expect
things to work just as they do at home. They are arrogant and don't
understand the way things are done.'

<TEXT>
GENERAL Dynamics of the US may dispute the award of a contract last week to
Arianespace of Europe to launch Indonesia's Palapa C-1 satellite system in
1995.
The award of the contract, worth an estimated Dollars 160m (Pounds 107m), by
the private Indonesian company Satelindo, took industry officials by
surprise. It will be the first Indonesian satellite not launched by a US
company.
Dr Clifton R Wharton, US deputy secretary of state, visiting Jakarta, said
yesterday that General Dynamics had met an Indonesian government minister to
discuss the case. The US government backed General Dynamics' bid.
Dr Wharton stopped short of accusing Arianespace of using unfair means to
win the deal but said Washington was discussing with Indonesia the need for
business 'transparency'.
Although Satelindo is a private company, the US may be able to place
pressure on the Indonesian government to change the contract, which remains
unsigned.

FT  29 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Textile industry attacks 'cynical' tariff
plan
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US textile industry, a key and unwilling participant in the Uruguay
Round, is denouncing a reported European Community proposal to cut US and
European textile tariffs to zero as a 'cynical and transparent attempt to
divert blame for the impasse in the negotiations to the US', writes Nancy
Dunne in Washington.
Mr Carlos Moore, executive director of the American Textile Manufacturers
Institute, said the EC was reported to be backing elimination of textile
tariffs in both the US and Europe and a 50 per cent cut in all apparel
tariffs. 'This is a ploy, because we have spoken with our counterparts in
Europe and they oppose what the EC has put on the table,' Mr Moore said.
A phasing out of textile tariffs would go well beyond the already steep cuts
reportedly backed by Mrs Carla Hills, the former US trade representative,
who 'agreed on some body of tariff cuts by 50 per cent', he said, adding
that industry officials had concluded the EC wanted to cut US textile
tariffs to divert production from the developing countries to America.
'Our industry and the European industry are already making an enormous
contribution to trade liberalisation by honouring demands by developing
countries to phase out the quotas,' Mr Moore said. Mr Arthur Dunkel, the
Gatt director-general, has proposed eliminating quotas over 10 years; Mr
Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, has indicated US support for a
longer quota phase-out - perhaps as long as 15 years.
In Washington, trade lobbyists have been speculating that once Congress
gives President Bill Clinton a renewal of his Gatt fast-track negotiating
authority - due to pass this week - Mr Kantor will feel considerably less
constrained about making concessions on textiles.
However, the Senate finance committee last week sent a letter to Mr Clinton
restating Congress' negotiating objective for the round. This included a
request to negotiate tariff cuts only 'where our private sector favours such
an action and significant trading partners concur'.
Mr Moore seemed confident Mr Kantor would not call on the industry to make
additional contributions to the round's success.
'Kantor is very concerned about the damage to this economy if an enormous
number of textile and apparel jobs are lost. I don't think he finds enormous
employment benefits in reducing low tariffs in Europe to zero,' he said.
'It could cost us more than 1m jobs. Does the US gain 1m jobs in
semiconductors and pharmaceuticals? Not hardly.'

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
US textiles and clothing imports have taken the sector trade deficit to a
high of Dollars 9bn (Pounds 6bn) for the first four months of 1993, writes
Daniel Green. It now accounts for almost a quarter of the total US trade
deficit.
Between January and April the US imported Dollars 12.5bn worth of textiles
and clothing, an increase of almost 8 per cent over the 1992 period. In
April, when the overall trade deficit fell, the textiles and clothing
deficit rose 13 per cent.
Mr Henry Truslow, president of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute,
blames Far Eastern countries which 'continue to close their markets to our
goods'. He also warned US Gatt negotiators that 'the most perilous threat to
our industry is the Dunkel draft' - the latest plan to conclude the Uruguay
Round.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Attack deepens Baghdad mood of pessimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BAGHDAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OUTSIDE one of the Baghdad houses flattened by stray US cruise missiles in
the weekend attack on Iraq's intelligence agency, rubble was yesterday being
used to fill a crater about 10 metres deep, while scraps of the culpable
missile were carefully placed on a table outside for all to see.
Predictably the focus for the Iraqi government and its people is the
civilian damage and casualties caused in the up-market Mansour district. At
least three missiles careered off target in the residential area, killing
six and wounding many others.
The air strike came as a surprise to most Iraqis but according to one of the
few remaining western ambassadors in Baghdad, this was not the case for the
Iraqi government.
US reconnaissance aircraft had been observed over the capital for two days
before the attack. The Iraqi regime had also expected some kind of reprisal
to be linked to the alleged plot to assassinate Mr George Bush on a visit to
Kuwait in April. Although the Iraqis deny any involvement in the
Kuwaiti-uncovered conspiracy, they realised early on what the accusations
might lead to, the ambassador said.
The intelligence agency headquarters itself has been sealed off but the view
from nearby suggests that at least two of the main buildings are beyond
repair.
One side of the central 10-storey block of offices is on the verge of
collapse, the floors forming a concertina. Next door, a six-storey building
has had most of its roof blown away. But a nearby newly-built
telecommunications tower remains intact.
Sensitivity of the site is underlined by the heavy military presence
surrounding the buildings. Iraq's secret service, or Mukhabarat, is one of
the most feared instruments of President Saddam Hussein's power.
After demonstrations and a state funeral for the civilian dead, yesterday
was calm as people got on with surviving under burdensome economic
sanctions.
But talk of western double standards compared to the situation in the former
Yugoslavia is common. And some say that Mr Clinton is using Iraq to show
that he does possess some muscle when it comes to foreign policy. But
hopelessness and apathy prevail. 'The people's feelings are dead. They've
suffered too much,' one Iraqi explained.
Foreign diplomats go further. They say that since Mr Clinton took power they
have noticed greater pessimism and despair among the Iraqis. Many had hoped
in vain for an easing of sanctions.
Apart from this, there is one factor which the Iraqis find more difficult to
swallow than anything else: George Bush still seems to be an influential
factor in the future prospects of the country.
A potent, and sarcastic, symbol of this recognition can be seen at the
entrance of the luxurious al-Rasheed hotel. The hotel lobby was hit by a
cruise missile during a US attack on a nuclear installation in January
during the last few days of Mr Bush's presidency. As part of the hotel's
rehabilitation programme the Iraqis have painted on the gleaming tiles
outside the front door a snarling portrait of the former US president which
is trodden on daily by hundreds of Iraqis and other hotel guests.
Such 'therapy', however, is unlikely to heal the increasing likelihood that
Iraq will remain a pariah state for a long time to come.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S constitutional negotiators are today expected to decide
whether to grant the right-wing Conservative party's demand for Afrikaner
self-determination. Police kept up pressure on the right yesterday by
arresting 21 people in connection with last Friday's armed siege of the
constitutional conference centre.
If the 26-party negotiating forum rejects the Conservative party's demand
for a separate Afrikaner homeland - or at least a highly autonomous
Afrikaner state within a federal South Africa - the party may quit
constitutional negotiations permanently. The decision to pull out could be
taken today or later in the week when the 208-delegate Negotiating Forum
meets.
Such a decision could prove a turning point in South African politics. The
heavily armed and well organised white right has made clear that it would
fight for an Afrikaner homeland, if it cannot achieve their demands through
negotiation.
Last night right-wingers were threatening retaliation after police said they
had arrested 21 members of right wing groups. They refused to name those
detained, but said more arrests - up to 300 - could be expected.
However the African National Congress condemned the action as insufficient.
It demanded the arrest of the protest leaders: Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg,
Conservative party leader, Mr Eugene Terreblanche, head of the Afrikaner
Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement), and Gen Constand
Viljoen, Afrikaner Volksfront leader.
Police said Mr Terreblanche - who openly led his men in the destruction on
Friday - was not being sought. They said it was difficult to identify his
role, despite the fact that hundreds of witnesses watched him lead the way
as an AWB armoured car drove through the glass front of the conference
centre.
The government and the ANC are clearly keen to prevent a Conservative party
walkout from the talks, fearing right-wing radicals could jeopardise a
future constitution. Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC leader, said in a television
interview: 'We are prepared to concede enough powers to regions to exercise
some form of self-rule' but he stressed that the ANC could not accept a
racist state.

FT  29 JUN 93 / South Africa and EC begin reconciliation: The shaping of
post-sanctions relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS South Africa moves into the post-sanctions era, aid, trade and political
relations are being shaped with a crucial partner - the European Community.
At a conference under way in Brussels both the European Commission and the
South African government are laying out their stalls.
Notwithstanding the tortuous progress of constitutional negotiations,
Community officials accept that a new South Africa is emerging, and they are
determined to be an important player in the post-apartheid process.
There is already a substantial base of trade and investment relations to
build on. Figures from the department of customs and excise show that in
1992 38.5 per cent, R46bn (Pounds 9.5bn) of a total R119.4bn visible trade,
was with Europe. This compares with 34 per cent in 1985, before sanctions
were implemented in earnest.
European countries also account for most of the foreign investment in South
Africa. The most recent available figures from the Reserve Bank (end 1988)
show that of the cumulative R70bn foreign investment in the country by
individuals and corporations, about 50 per cent came from Europe.
The EC is also a significant donor to South Africa. The 1993 EC aid budget
to South Africa is Ecu90m (Pounds 70.7m), its largest budget in Africa.
Diplomatic links between South Africa and the EC are less developed. There
is no formal diplomatic treaty and the EC is not formally present in
Pretoria other than to administer its aid programme. Upgrading these links
is important to South Africa, however, as the imprimatur of full diplomatic
relations will improve the climate for trade and investment.
Recent years have seen increasing efforts at diversification, mostly
eastwards, of South Africa's trading links. Thus 20 per cent of South
Africa's total trade in 1992 was with Asia, compared with 14.7 per cent in
1985. Taiwan has risen from nowhere to be one of South Africa's top 10
trading partners.
Among South Africa's priorities in talks with Brussels will be what sort of
trade preferences it should seek from the EC, which could affect 20 per cent
of exports, most notably those from labour-intensive agriculture.
The extent of preferences will depend on what sort of trading status South
Africa is granted. Although a per capita annual income of about Dollars
2,300 ranks it as an upper middle-income developing country, other
indicators - such as infant mortality, literacy, and reliance on a few
commodity exports - are associated more with developing countries.
At the conference yesterday Mr Chris Stals, governor of the South African
Reserve (central) Bank, said South Africa should consider seeking developing
country status. 'I do not think that will decrease our credibility, but it
will help us to develop the country much faster,' he said.
His remarks, which were made in a personal capacity, echo the view on this
issue held among others by Mr Nelson Mandela, African National Congress
president.
At recent Gatt discussions in Geneva, however, Japan and the US gave notice
that they would not support South Africa being given developing country
status. It was advised to seek 'economy in transition' status, such as has
been given to various east European countries, which affords similar
benefits granted to developing countries, but on a less permanent basis.
Given this background, South Africa will probably try to negotiate some
specially tailored package of preferences with the EC rather than try to
join the Lome Convention, a trade concession deal between a grouping of
developing countries and industrialised countries.
The latter route would cause all sorts of complications, as Lome's existing
80 members, all of whom are smaller and less developed than South Africa,
would understandably oppose granting benefits to South Africa which, to some
extent, would come at their expense. Included in this group are all of South
Africa's neighbours.
The EC has already made clear that its policy towards South Africa will be
premised on viewing South Africa as part of the southern Africa region.
Although there are growing ties between South Africa and its neighbours, the
issue of how to integrate it into regional structures, such as the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) and the Preferential Trade Area (PTA)
is fraught with excessive expectations of what South Africa can do for the
rest of the region and fears that it will dominate the others. South Africa
accounts for about 75 per cent of regional gross domestic product.
Although the shape of future South Africa/EC relations lies mostly in the
hands of Brussels - where the extent of any concessions will be decided -
their success will be determined in Pretoria. For South Africa's future will
ultimately turn on whether its politicians can create a favourable climate
for investment. If they fail in that, the rest will count for little.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Japanese parties promise more of the same: Recent political
upheavals may prove to be just cosmetic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S socialist opposition parties, rather than the ruling Liberal
Democratic party, could emerge as the big losers from the country's
political turmoil. The main gainers will be a new breed of conservative
parties, chief among them the recently formed Japan New party, which will
draw away independent voters in urban areas who have reluctantly voted
socialist in the past.
The emergence of modernising conservative parties, in part formed by splits
in the LDP's ranks, may put a cap on the ruling party's vote in urban areas,
but LDP support will not collapse.
Those are the main messages of closely watched Tokyo metropolitan elections
over the weekend, which suggest the 18-months old JNP could hold the balance
of power after the general election due on July 18.
The JNP, which ran 22 candidates in the Tokyo assembly elections, won 20
seats, an increase of 18. The Social Democratic party, the main opposition
party, lost 18 of its 32 seats, while the LDP increased its standing by two
seats to 44.
The question is: will the JNP be more than just a passing fashion ?
Its articulate founder, the 55-year old Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, says he aims
for a 'power shift' in Japanese politics. He admits the new party will be
stifled if it does not succeed quickly. He explains: 'We have a year. If our
party does not make a secure footing within a power shift our popularity
will drop.'
Yet even if the JNP retains its popularity it is difficult to predict its
influence on Japanese policy, largely because Mr Hosokawa has refrained from
specific commitments. His aristocratic background is far from revolutionary.
His family have been lords of a feudal clan for more than 600 years. When he
entered politics in 1971 his haughtiness won him the nickname Lord Hosokawa.
He served in senior positions for the LDP before becoming governor of his
native Kumamoto prefecture in 1983. He resigned in 1991 when it seemed the
LDP would support him to become governor of Tokyo. The LDP did not deliver
and the subsequent launch of the JNP is widely thought to reflect his
personal bitterness rather than fundamental policy disagreements with the
LDP. Indeed, he recently told an magazine interviewer that Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, prime minister, was someone with whom he could form a coalition
government.
Nor is Mr Hosokawa entirely free from hints of scandal. He has admitted
accepting political donations from the Sagawa Kyubin transport group, which
has become a byword for political corruption in Japan.
In spite of this, Mr Hosokawa has managed to create a clean image for the
JNP which attracts younger voters.
The JNP's success has not just exposed the socialist's vulnerability and the
limits to the LDP's support in urban areas. It also poses a dilemma for Mr
Tsutomu Hata, the leader of Shinseito, the 44-strong group which defected
from the LDP last week in the name of political reform.
Mr Hata moved swiftly to ally with the Social Democratic party. But JNP's
success has made the socialist opposition seem weak and backward-looking,
qualities which the reformists in Shinseito want to avoid association with.
Mr Hata's alliance with the ailing socialists seems to many voters to smack
of old-fashioned opportunism rather than radical reformism.
For all the recent upheaval, which started with Mr Miyazawa's defeat in a
no-confidence motion, one thing has not changed: even the reformers are so
afraid of antagonising special interest groups that they refrain from
proposing clear and potentially controversial policies. There has been a
huge upheaval in party labels, but not in policies.
As a senior Finance Ministry official explained: 'The extent of the change
has been overestimated. The parties are changing but unless this produces
different policies for the government there will be little change and at the
moment no one is offering any new policies.'

FT  29 JUN 93 / Action to cut surplus 'would stoke up inflation'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANY ATTEMPT to meet demands from Washington for a rapid reduction in Japan's
current account surplus would be unsustainable, as it would stoke up
inflation in Japan, a senior Bank of Japan official warned yesterday.
The official warned that a large part of the current account surplus was
structural and so would not be rapidly reduced by higher growth in Japan to
suck in imports.
An attempt to cut this structural surplus by using macro-economic policies
would simply fuel inflation, the BoJ official explained.
His comments imply that the Bank of Japan would probably tighten monetary by
raising interest rates if it thought public spending was being relaxed too
far to meet US demands for higher growth.
His comments came after Mr Lawrence Summers, the US treasury undersecretary
for international affairs, called in a speech to Japanese business leaders
on Friday for Japan to cut the surplus to about 1.5 per cent of gross
national product (GNP) over the next three years.
The surplus is expected to reach about Dollars 150bn (Pounds 102bn) this
year, 3.5 per cent of gross national product.
The Bank of Japan official said: 'If we stimulate the economy to cut the
surplus to 1.5 per cent of GNP in the short run that would have a very
adverse impact on prices. So we have to be very careful.'
He added: 'A rapid reduction in the surplus would be in no one's interests.'
The official said a large part of the surplus was structural, in that it
reflected the high level of saving for retirement pensions, as Japanese
society is ageing rapidly.
The remainder was cyclical, a reflection of the slowdown in Japan's economy
and its demand for imports.
Mr Summers argued that the goal of cutting the current account surplus to
1.5 per cent of GNP was acceptable because that was the average level of
Japan's surplus over the past 20 years.
The BoJ official said that over the past decade the average level of the
surplus had been higher because of higher savings for retirement.
As a result of this the structural component of the surplus had risen, he
said.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Debt stalks Indonesia donors: The problems of a leading aid
recipient
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA'S international donors, who began their annual three-day meeting
in Paris yesterday, might be forgiven for withholding their pens for a
moment before signing away an expected Dollars 5bn in aid. While Indonesia
has a strong record of economic growth, the pace of liberalisation has
slowed and new impediments to prosperity have emerged.
Among the world's largest recipients of aid, the country has been lauded by
the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank as their star pupil. Moving
from an oil-based economy in the early 1980s, Indonesia has used its cheap
labour and abundant natural resources to develop an array of
labour-intensive export industries.
The growth in non-oil exports, which last year totalled Dollars 21.9bn
(Pounds 14.6bn), has averaged 18 per cent over the past five years, with 26
per cent annual growth in manufactures, such as textiles, shoes and timber
products. Donors expect manufacturing to rise from 16 per cent of gross
domestic product now to 23 per cent by the year 2000.
The government has also reined back a current account deficit of Dollars
4.3bn in 1991-92 to an estimated Dollars 2.9bn in 1992-93. Public and
private foreign debt grew nearly 9 per cent last year to about Dollars 87bn
 -resulting in a 31 per cent debt service ratio - but as one donor executive
explains, 'next year will see a considerable slowing in Indonesia's absolute
debt'.
Concerns surround the domestic banking sector, however, and there is a fear
that many of Indonesia's conglomerates are concealing a midden of debt in
their accounts.
Unlikely to be participating in Indonesia's export-drive this year are more
than 300 businessmen on whom the government slapped a six-month travel ban
last week. Government officials say the businessmen are each at least Rp250m
(Pounds 80,000)in default to the state banks and state companies.
They add that the ban is coincidental with the leaking of an alleged list of
the state banks' worst corporate debtors compiled by the monetary
authorities. The list, not yet verified by government officials, shows 26
companies - many politically well-connected, including three led by
relatives of President Suharto - not servicing loans totalling Rp6,900bn.
If accurate, the list would confirm the worst estimates of the banking
sector's non-performing loans. The sector's assets total about Rp130,000bn,
split almost evenly between state and private banks. The government line is
that non-performing loans total about Rp8,000bn, of which Rp3,500bn are
considered unrecoverable.
A World Bank report last month, however, stated that 'loan portfolio quality
has deteriorated sharply since 1990, with conservative estimates that
classified (non-performing) loans represented about 15 per cent of all bank
loans in late 1992' or closer to Rp20,000bn.
The travel ban may be a welcome sign of the government's determination to
right the sector's wrongs. It would also go some way to placating donors
frustrated by the government's apparent reluctance in the past two years to
maintain the pace of economic liberalisation.
A deregulation package earlier this month disappointed economists, making
marginal reductions in the level of tariffs and opening up minor sectors to
foreign investors.
As the World Bank report made clear, with more than 9,200 categories,
Indonesia's tariff system remains too complex and 'non-tariff barriers and
effective rates of protection are high'.
Donors believe there is increasing collusion between importers and customs
officials to evade tariffs. There has been a decline in imports undergoing
pre-shipment inspection (to which all shipments above a value of Dollars
5,000 are subject) from 67 per cent five years ago to just 47 per cent last
year.
Not only is the government losing revenue, but economists argue tariffs and
import controls are stifling potential export industries. For instance,
processed food, despite Indonesia's broad agricultural base, constituted
less than 2 per cent of non-oil exports in the last seven years.
The industry's competitiveness has been damaged by government control of the
import and retail price of sugar, a key input in food processing, which has
kept the domestic price more than 30 per cent above the world market.
Removing tariffs, however, would damage the interests of many politically
well-connected companies. And while the donors would like the pace of reform
to quicken, too many demands will rile government ministers.
Two decades of funding has left donors financially exposed, a fact which
gives Jakarta almost as much leverage over its benefactors as vice versa.

<TEXT>
ERITREA, Africa's newest independent state, stunned the opening session of
an Organisation of African Unity summit yesterday by declaring that the OAU
had been an utter failure for 30 years, Reuter reports from Cairo.
'The sad fact remains that the OAU has become a nominal organisation that
has failed to deliver on its pronounced objectives and commitments,'
Eritrean President Isayas Afewerki told a hushed conference hall.
'Although the OAU has often championed the lofty ideals of unity,
co-operation, economic development, human rights and other worthy
objectives, it has failed to seriously work towards their concrete
realisation.
'Thirty years after the foundation of this organisation, our continent
remains affected by growing poverty and backwardness.
'The African continent is today a marginalised actor in global politics and
the world economic order,' he said.
'Africa is not a place where its citizens can walk with raised heads but a
continent scorned by all its partners, a continent that seems to produce
endlessly the wrong manuals for economic development, democratisation and
political management,' Mr Afewerki declared.

INDIA and China yesterday agreed to open an additional border trading post
at Shipkilah in the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, and agreed
further confidence-building measures, such as increased transparency about
the location of military positions, in order to maintain peace.
The agreement was announced by Mr J N Dixit, the Indian foreign secretary,
on the concluding day of the India-China joint working group talks between
him and Mr Tang Jiaxuan, Chinese vice foreign minister, and senior officials
from the defence ministries of both countries.
At a news conference in New Delhi, Mr Dixit admitted that India and China
had 'a difference of views' on the signing of the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty. When India voiced concern about the supply of Chinese missiles to
Pakistan, the Chinese delegation held that Beijing's policy of arms sales
was not directed against India, and said the quantity of arms supplied to
Islamabad had been 'small'.
Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, will visit China in the
first week of September for further bilateral talks.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Tokyo stock market rose 1.2 per cent yesterday and the yen strengthened
against the dollar, following Tokyo council elections at the weekend. In the
polls the ruling Liberal Democratic party held its own in the face of
predictions that it could lose power in a general election on July 18,
writes Charles Leadbeater in Tokyo.
The dollar finished the day in Tokyo at Y106, down Y0.35, while the Nikkei
average rose 227.19 points to close at 19,886.76, largely in response to the
LDP's solid showing.
The Japan New party, which was the main gainer in the Tokyo poll, announced
it would be fielding up to 70 candidates in the general election. The party
is aiming to hold the balance of power in a hung parliament.
The LDP's weakness, in spite of its Tokyo showing, was underlined by the
party's announcement that it would field 282 candidates, the smallest ever
team in a lower house election.
The list means it is almost certain that the party will not win the 275
seats it held before the lower house of the parliament was dissolved 10 days
ago and 48 LDP lower house members defected to set up rival parties or to
run as independents.

THE US and North Korea have agreed to reopen high-level talks in Geneva on
July 14 on nuclear and other issues, according to South Korean officials, AP
reports from Seoul.
This would follow a visit by President Bill Clinton to Seoul on July 10-11.
The Geneva talks have been called to follow up on earlier high-level contact
during which Pyongyang reversed an earlier decision and agreed to remain a
signatory to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty.
The North did not say anything then, however, about reopening its facilities
to international inspections. The North allowed four inspections in 1992 but
refused to accommodate a demand to inspect two facilities suspected of being
nuclear waste dumps.
Mr Han Sung-joo, South Korean foreign minister, said on Sunday the North's
nuclear issues would top the agenda in the talks between Mr Clinton and
South Korean President Kim Young-sam.
North Korea, a hard-line Marxist state, is suspected of developing nuclear
weapons, despite its denials.

GUATEMALAN President Ramiro de Leon Carpio yesterday removed General Roberto
Perussina, his hardline defence minister, after just three weeks in office
and replaced him with a moderate, writes Edward Orlebar in Guatemala City.
The new minister, General Mario Enriquez Morales, opposed the coup attempt
last month by the now-deposed President Jorge Serrano and the subsequent bid
by former vice-president Gustavo Espina to assume office. Gen Enriquez has
been a senior negotiator in two-year-old peace talks with left-wing
guerrillas.
Mr de Leon said he had made the move to consolidate democracy and as a sign
of his promised restructuring of the executive branch of government. The
president appears to be using his popular support - and a constituency
within the military - to affirm civilian authority over the armed forces.

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN INDEPENDENT commission finished work at the weekend on a list of US
military bases to be closed to bring the Pentagon's facilities into line
with its force structure.
The commission proposes shutting some of the US's largest and oldest naval
bases, such as the Charleston naval station and shipyard in South Carolina
and the Alameda naval air station and Mare Island shipyard in San Francisco
bay.
The commission was originally established because Congress found it so
difficult to shut any of the country's military bases - one of the main
mechanisms through which US government money is pumped into the
constituencies of powerful legislators.
The commission, supposedly more hard-hearted and less emotional than
Congress, has spent weeks mulling over an original list of base closures
submitted by the Pentagon. But individual members of the commission -
chaired by Mr James Courter, a former congressman - often found the process
tough.
The list of bases to be closed must now be approved by President Bill
Clinton and Congress, but the commission's recommendations cannot be
tinkered with. The US has already shut more than 700 military installations
overseas, mostly in Europe.
The US Navy will undergo the most radical changes as a result of the
proposed base closures. The shutdown of most of the Charleston facilities
will leave it concentrated in one big shipyard on each coast  - San Diego in
California and Norfolk in Virginia.
The commission agreed for the most part with the Navy's own recommendations,
after considering and rejecting the possibility of closing Norfolk instead
of Charleston.
Both Norfolk and San Diego will, however, lose jobs with the closure of
training and aircraft maintenance depots.
Studies show that communities have in the past often been able to create
more jobs than they lost by converting bases to civil airports or industrial
parks.

A E STALEY, the US subsidiary of Britain's Tate &amp; Lyle, has locked out
workers at its Decatur, Illinois, corn-milling plant, where a contract
dispute with about 800 members of the Allied Industrial Workers' Union has
been continuing since September, write Maggie Urry in London and Nikki Tait
in New York.
Tate said that management 'has been forced to begin a lockout of hourly
employees' after 'environmental problems arising from the union's in-plant
strategy'. The company alleged that workers had been putting waste from the
process into the drainage system, causing problems for the local sewerage
authority.
'That's just an accusation,' retorted the AIW. It claims that, with regular
employees working to rule, management failed to maintain environmental
standards.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Court questions redrawing of voting districts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Supreme Court yesterday called into question the redrawing of
congressional electoral boundaries so as to ensure greater representation
for minorities.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the 5-4 majority, said 'racial
classifications of any sort pose the risk of lasting harm to our society'.
Racial gerrymandering, even for remedial purposes, demanded close judicial
scrutiny, she said.
The court, which earlier this year had ruled that the creation of minority
districts did not violate the 1965 Voting Rights Act, sent back to the lower
federal courts a challenge brought by five white voters in North Carolina
who claimed they had suffered discrimination as a result of redrawing of
electoral districts by the state legislature in 1991.
Justice O'Connor did not uphold this claim per se, but advised that such
reapportionment should not be so 'irrational that it can be understood only
as an effort to segregate voters. . . because of their race'. One of the two
new North Carolina districts has a bizarre 160-mile elongated shape.
Last year's elections saw contests in more than 20 new districts nationwide
with black or Hispanic majorities. As a result 13 new black and six new
Hispanic members of congress were returned, bringing total representation to
a record 38 blacks and 17 Hispanics in the House. Both new North Carolina
seats elected blacks.
The fine division on this case underlines how evenly the court is now
balanced.
Of the three pivotal moderates, Justice Anthony Kennedy joined Justice
O'Connor in the conservative majority while Justice David Souter was among
the dissenters. So was Justice Byron White, who retires this summer and who
is due to be replaced, pending Senate confirmation, by Judge Ruth Bader
Ginsburg, President Bill Clinton's nominee.

A E STALEY, the US subsidiary of Britain's Tate &amp; Lyle, has locked out
workers at its Decatur, Illinois, corn-milling plant, where a contract
dispute with about 800 members of the Allied Industrial Workers' Union has
been continuing since September.

'That's just an accusation,' retorted the AIW. It claims that, with regular

The lockout brings to a head a simmering dispute over a new contract at the
plant, which the AIW rejects and which management has attempted to impose
unilaterally.
An earlier lockout at the plant ended within 24 hours, but this time both
sides were expecting a long fight. Tate said production was being maintained
by salaried staff, although there was speculation that it planned to bring
in temporary replacement workers. The union, meanwhile, plans a series of
demonstrations, and is renewing calls for a boycott of Tate's Domino brand
sugar.
The Staley dispute has attracted widespread attention, partly because it is
near Peoria, where unions and management at Caterpillar fought a furious
labour battle last year. Over the weekend workers formed a chain between
Staley and Caterpillar plants.

FT  29 JUN 93 / US agency stiffens guidelines for AZT: Wellcome's shares hit
by recommendation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADDITIONAL guidelines for the use of AZT, the most widely used drug to treat
HIV and Aids, have been submitted by the US National Institutes of Health.
The influential agency recommended that doctors and patients not showing
symptoms (asymptomatic) should decide between them whether to start using
the therapy. Previously it had advised all patients with HIV to take the
drug as soon as white blood cells in the immune system, called CD4 cells,
fell to about half the normal level.
Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases and a leading Aids researcher, said: 'The option of not
treating is a viable option.' He added that the drug remained the first line
of defence against the disease.
The recommendations follow an Anglo-French study presented at the annual
Aids conference this month, suggesting the drug, Wellcome's second
best-selling medicine, might be of limited use in asymptomatic patients.
Dr Trevor Jones, Wellcome's research and development officer, said: 'I would
have preferred that they just continued to endorse the existing guidelines
rather than add these caveats, but it does confirm the utility of the drug
in asymptomatic patients.' Wellcome estimated between 10 per cent and 15 per
cent of those on AZT were asymptomatic.
The drug had sales of Pounds 131m in the six months to February 1993. AZT's
worldwide sales were Pounds 213m in 1991-92, representing 12.5 per cent of
group turnover.
Wellcome's shares fell 10p to 688p yesterday on the news. The fall was
exacerbated by concerns over a court case involving AZT's patents which
started yesterday between Wellcome and two US generics companies, Barr
Laboratories and Novopharm.
The American companies argue the drug was co-developed for treating Aids by
US government scientists, and that the British group should not hold
exclusive rights. They want to supply the drug at far lower prices than
Wellcome.
The patents are due to expire in 2005.
UK-based analysts said the company's shares were likely to remain volatile
during the six- to eight-week trial, which is being held before a jury in
New Bern, North Carolina.
'Based on the science, Wellcome should win,' said Mr Paul Woodhouse, analyst
at Smith New Court. 'But it is in front of a jury and Aids and AZT are
emotive issues.
'If Wellcome loses, the inevitable appeal will be held in front of a judge,
and sanity should prevail.'

US President Bill Clinton will meet Argentina's President Carlos Menem today

Since Mr Menem abandoned Argentina's century-old anti-Americanism when he
came to power four years ago, his new alliance with Washington has brought
important advantages.
US support in international financial organisations accelerated Argentine
economic reforms. This in turn has encouraged US inward investment: the US

6bn) privatisation programme.
The government's successful adoption of market policies, its willingness to
abandon strategic weapons projects and submit to international nuclear and
missile technology safeguards are genuinely appreciated in Washington.
The US is anxious to encourage Argentina as an example of good behaviour for
other developing countries. The Clinton administration has regularly
mentioned Argentina - along with Chile and Venezuela - as being prime
candidates for accession to the North American Free Trade Agreement which
may be ratified this year between the US, Canada and Mexico.
Argentina's Foreign Ministry is euphoric over the warmth of relations with
Washington. One official said: 'Mexico has entered the North American orbit
and therefore has lost value as a Latin interlocutor. The US needs a valid
interlocutor and it has made its choice. Argentina is democratic, the
economy is booming and (we) have enormous influence in the hemisphere.'
Some observers in Buenos Aires think this may be going too far. Mr Carlos
Escude, a former government adviser, warned: 'The US has taken the substance
of Menem's policies seriously. Many of his policies cannot be easily
reversed. But we must keep clear that Argentina is not an important country
for the US. Not only are we distant, but we have a competing economy and
have less to offer than Mexico, Brazil or Venezuela.'
Washington has already disabused Buenos Aires of any illusions that it can
expect big trade privileges. Last week, the US announced countervailing
duties on Argentine steel exports and said it was increasing its exports of
subsidised grains - a market in which Argentina competes with the US.
Trade will figure high on the agenda and inevitably, dialogue will be
one-sided. The US will demand passage of patent and intellectual property
legislation and removal of non-tariff trade barriers.
Argentina will ask the US to stop exporting subsidised grains. Agricultural
exports account for 70 per cent of Argentina's export revenues. It will also
ask for better access to US markets for manufactured and agricultural
products like leather.
The Argentine president will also repeat demands that Washington keep its
promises to sell two squadrons of second-hand A4 Skyhawk fighter bombers.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Now private is preferred in Peru: Fujimori's pension reform
and state sector sell-off prove popular
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE advertising slogan for Peru's new private pension funds, which started
operating last Monday, runs: 'The future is in good hands - your own.'
It neatly summarises the philosophy of Peru's liberalising government of
President Alberto Fujimori. After decades of state control and
protectionism, the pendulum has swung dramatically the other way.
Privatisation and foreign investment is touted as the panacea for all
economic ills - , even those of Peru's traditionally militant leftist
workers who are still unionised largely support the move.
Acceptance of the private sector as the dynamo of the economy has been
assisted by widespread popular disgust at long-standing inefficiency and
corruption in almost all state-run activities.
Opinion polls show a steady 50 to 60 per cent support for privatisation,
while almost a third of workers say they expect to transfer their state
pension to the new, private pension funds, AFPs, closely modelled on the
successful Chilean experience. In setting up the AFPs, with a minimum of red
tape and political opposition, Peru is again in the Latin American vanguard.
About 300,000 retired workers depend on the Peruvian state for their
pensions. They receive the equivalent of a wretched Dollars 90 a month from
their lifetime's contributions - and their plight worsens each year. The
new, voluntary scheme aims to provide both a better retirement pension on an
individual capitalisation basis and boost Peru's underdeveloped capital
markets.
About 2m Peruvians affiliated to IPSS, the state social security scheme, are
now free to transfer their contributions to privately-managed funds. The
state will issue a bond to each contributor who chooses to opt out, its
value simply calculated on the basis of age and recent earnings.
Workers who switch will contribute 10 per cent of monthly earnings,
compensated by a one-time wage increase. Older workers will do better, say
experts, to stick with the IPSS system which, the government guarantees,
will continue to pay out for their lifetimes.
Five AFPs have been authorised by the newly-designated regulatory body and
three more are being vetted. International insurance and banking concerns
such as Aetna, Citibank, and the well-established Chilean AFPs Habitat and
Provida, are participating.
The level of interest suggests there are profits to be made in AFPs -
although Mr Enrique Diaz, the AFP's technical superintendent says start-up
costs for an AFP are high (up to Dollars 8m, including publicity) and could
take four years to recover. Between 800,000 and 1.2m Peruvians are expected
to affiliate to AFPs in the first year, generating anything between Dollars
150m and Dollars 350m in capital.
It is not yet clear where funds will be invested. In the early months, the
lion's share is likely to go into term deposits in the Peruvian banking
system. The Central Reserve Bank, in association with the AFP
superintendency, has the last word on investments but it seems private funds
will at first be permitted to place only a tiny percentage in Lima's stock
market.
'But the percentages established and the permitted instruments will be under
constant revision,' says Mr Diaz. 'The idea is to be very dynamic and
respond as new instruments appear.'
Mr Diaz hopes the central bank and, later, the government will issue bonds.
But the medium-term expectation is that the existence of AFPs will encourage
Peruvian companies to raise capital via primary bond and stock issues, thus
providing much-needed medium and long-term finance for industry.
Meanwhile, if all goes to plan, a substantial portion of Peru's big public
sector companies will also be privatised this year. Privatisation is moving
farther and faster in Peru than in any other Latin American country. Copri,
the government privatisation office, is estimating the treasury will net
between Dollars 1.4bn and Dollars 1.6bn from sales this year alone. When the
Fujimori regime took office in 1990, the state sector was costing the
country about Dollars 2.5bn a year.
Mr Fujimori has decreed there are no longer any 'strategic' sectors of the
economy, to be reserved for Peruvian nationals - the country's mineral
resources, oil and gas, drinking water and sewage, electricity and
telephones are all on offer to the private sector.
Among the state-owned companies due for sale before the end of the year are
the mining and refining units of Centromin and Mineroperu; 20 fishmeal
plants belonging to Pesca Peru; the state telecommunication company Entel
and the state holding in CPT, Lima's telephone company; plus the
distribution networks of Electrolima and Electroperu.
Most of the evaluation and promotion work has been allocated by tender to
international consultants and investment banks. Coopers and Lybrand, Price
Waterhouse, Morgan Grenfell, First Boston, Chase Manhattan and Bankers Trust
have all carved niches for themselves in Peru's privatisation process.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Sweden snubbed over Bosnia post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS, UN Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UN secretary general Boutros Boutros Ghali has offended Sweden, perhaps the
world organisation's most loyal supporter, by replacing the Swedish
commander of peacekeeping forces in Bosnia with a French officer, without
consulting Stockholm.
The nomination of General Jean Cot to succeed Lt General Lars-Eric Wahlgren,
which will take effect on July 1, was confirmed by the Security Council in
an exchange of letters made public yesterday.
But Mr Peter Osvald, Sweden's UN delegate, complained that Mr Boutros Ghali
made his decision without bothering to advise in advance either the Swedish
government or Gen Wahlgren, who has a distinguished career in UN
peacekeeping.
It appears the secretary general also neglected to inform the
troop-contributing countries other than France, with whom he arranged the
transfer of command during a visit to Paris last week.
Gen Wahlgren had been commander only since March. The Swedish parliament
only recently approved the dispatch of 1,000 troops to Bosnia.
It was not known whether they would be for general peacekeeping duty or
deployment in Moslem 'safe areas' that are badly in need of United Nations
forces. In any event, the change of command could delay their arrival.
French Lt Gen Philipe Morillon, who became something of a hero for defying
the Serbs to escort humanitarian aid to the beleaguered Moslems, is also
being replaced. His successor has not yet been named.
The possibility that UN peacekeeping operations might be terminated in the
absence of an early political settlement has been raised in a report to the
Security Council.
In recommending that the UN force mandate be extended for only three months,
to September 30, Mr Boutros Ghali emphasised that if the parties involved in
the conflict failed to demonstrate a commitment to a settlement, it would
not be worthwhile to use the UN's limited resources to maintain the
operation.

FT  29 JUN 93 / UK accuses EC of 'plot' over fuel tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S environment minister, Mr John Gummer, claimed last night to have
defeated an EC ambush intended to get the UK to agree that a Community-wide
energy tax was a pre-condition for the Twelve to ratify the Rio climate
change convention.
As a result of the row, expected agreement on ratification of the convention
 -through which the EC commits itself to stabilising carbon dioxide
emissions at 1990 levels by 2000 - looked certain to be postponed.
Six EC member states led by Germany and the Netherlands said in March that
the Rio target was not possible without the tax, calling into question
ratification of the convention. In April, energy and environment ministers
from 11 member states agreed on the principle of an EC energy tax, although
finance ministers of the 12 earlier this month shelved further discussion of
the tax.
The tax, due originally to have started this year at Dollars 3 per barrel of
oil equivalent, is supposed to rise to Dollars 10 by 2000.
Mr Gummer said the Danish presidency 'tried to bounce us by getting a piece
of paper which said the 11 took one view but we took another'. He derided
the attempt as 'a plot that failed, happily', because even pro-tax member
states like Germany objected to 'the stitch-up', and doubters like Spain
underlined there was still no consensus on how the burden would be shared.
Mr Hans Alders, the Dutch environment minister, said the UK minister 'was at
another lunch' and that 'the British are still in an isolated position'. He
said a May 27 memorandum from Sir John Cope, the UK paymaster general, had
definitively ruled out Britain's acceptance of an EC-wide tax, and invited
'those member states who wished to do so to introduce a tax which is
compatible with the single market'.
The Dutch minister said the Commission would be bringing forward detailed
plans on 'burden-sharing' before the summer break, and the ratification
issue would not be settled before October.
Mr Gummer also claimed that at last week's Copenhagen summit, EC heads of
government 'said very clearly' that how to reach the emissions target was
for national governments to decide, as the UK had done by introducing fuel
and heating oil taxes.
Mr Svend Auken, the Danish chairman of the stormy meeting, described Mr
Gummer's interpretation of the Copenhagen conclusions as 'purely personal',
while Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, EC environment commissioner, added that the
British minister's reading of Copenhagen was 'arbitrary'.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Rules tightened on van exhaust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PASSENGER vans and light goods vehicles in the European Community will have
to be fitted with catalytic converters from next year, environment ministers
decided yesterday. This will bring them into line with exhaust emission
controls on cars and lorries.
Ministers were also aiming to reach a political deal setting even more
stringent emission targets for cars for 1996 and 2000, which carmakers say
would add 5 per cent to manufacturing costs.
The emissions regime for cars, in force since January, is now extended to
new models of van from October, and all newly registered vans from October
1994. It covers passenger vehicles carrying up to nine people and goods
vehicles under 3.5 tonnes. Broadly, current standards seek to cut emissions
of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and carbon particulates by
85-90 per cent from 1970 levels.
Only the Dutch dissented on the vans decision, but from a 'greener'
standpoint. The Netherlands, along with Germany and Denmark, want more
generous fiscal incentives for cleaner cars than now allowed in order to cut
emissions faster. Britain, France, Spain and others fear too big 'green' tax
discounts could distort competition in the EC's single market.
Though there is consensus on the European Commission's approach to cutting
vehicle emissions, disagreement over fiscal incentives loomed as a barrier
to an early accord.
Ministers also agreed on measures to control emissions from petrol
distribution and vehicle refuelling, and were due to discuss better fuel
quality as part of the new generation of emission controls.
There was hope, too, of agreement today on reducing emissions such as
sulphur dioxide and hydrogen chloride and fluoride, through cleaner burning
of industrial waste. This could imply the upgrading of all existing
incineration facilities within three years.

MR GINO GIUGNI, Italy's labour minister, warned that crucial talks between
employers and trade unions on a new wage bargaining system had got off to a
difficult final week yesterday, with employers determined to get a
favourable agreement.
The talks, which the government wants to conclude by Monday, have faltered
on difficulties in bridging differences over simplifying the bargaining
system and increasing labour flexibility.
Mr Giugni said: 'The chances of reaching an agreement. . . have gone down.'
He said yesterday's meeting between ministers and the Confindustria
employers' federation had 'gone badly'. The government would present a
compromise document later this week.

MEMBERS of Bosnia's multi-ethnic presidency said in Geneva yesterday that
they would be going to the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, today to try to
persuade its current head, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, to rejoin the peace
negotiations.
Mr Franjo Boras, Croat head of a seven-strong presidency delegation to the
Geneva peace talks, said the Sarajevo meeting would be followed within a few
days by a second session 'elsewhere in Bosnia'.
Mr Izetbegovic, together with Mr Ejup Ganic, his vice-president, have so far
boycotted the talks on the proposed division of the country into a
confederation of three ethnic mini-states, which Mr Izetbegovic has
condemned as tantamount to genocide for the Moslems.
The international mediators, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, are
hoping the new plan will at least guarantee the Moslems their own viable and
secure geographical entity.
It was not clear if the two mediators would attend the Sarajevo meeting, but
diplomats said both were expected to travel to the Croatian capital, Zagreb,
to be close at hand.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said yesterday that Serbs and
Croats were close to an 'overall agreement' on Bosnia's ethnic division and
urged Moslem leaders to return to the negotiating table. Speaking after
talks with Mr Mate Boban, the Bosnian Croat leader. Mr Karadzic said the two
sides had agreed on everything except a map of the three ethnic mini-states
they are demanding.
'The only part that remained to be agreed is the map of the three republics
and both Serbs and Croats are ready to form their own states,' he said.
Earlier, Mr Karadzic had promised the Moslems nearly 30 per cent of Bosnia,
but warned that Serbs and Croats would not hesitate to carve up the country
between them if the Moslems did not negotiate. 'If they fail to do so,
Bosnia will in effect be split into two parts. Some of the Moslems will
remain with us, while the Croats will get the others,' he told the Yugoslav
news agency, Tanjug.

FT  29 JUN 93 / French small business jobs deal: Balladur secures promise of
200,000 more posts for young
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, has enlisted the small
business sector in his fight to cut unemployment, but at the cost of handing
out yet another tax break and of pledging to curb the expansion of
supermarkets.
The CGPME small business federation promised Mr Balladur at the weekend that
its members would try to hire 200,000 more young people this autumn. The
prime minister failed to get the Patronat employers' federation to commit
itself to a similar target.
In return, Mr Balladur raised the amount - from FFr15,000 (Pounds 1,790) to
FFr20,000 - people can put into tax-free savings accounts for banks to lend
to small businesses, and asked banks to lower the interest rate, from 8.75
per cent to 8.25 per cent, they charge on these loans. This would make an
extra FFr10bn in subsidised loans available to small businesses, Mr Balladur
said. The big commercial banks have said they will cut their base rate
further on Thursday to 8.4 per cent. But small businesses generally have to
pay much more, because banks consider them riskier customers.
In another example of how recession is driving the conservative government
into intervention as well as deficit, Mr Balladur said he intended to
shorten the duration of credit which supermarkets could demand from their
suppliers - thereby probably forcing them to raise their prices - and to
make it harder for new supermarkets to open.
One of Mr Balladur's first acts on taking power in April was to order a
six-month freeze on the opening of new supermarkets. Small shopkeepers, who
complain of unfair supermarket competition, are a core constituency of his
RPR Gaullist party. However, in line with the EC Copenhagen summit's stress
on the need to keep Europe's labour costs down, the government has said
France's minimum wage will rise on July 1 by only half the average real
increase in purchasing power.
Meanwhile, the government faces a dilemma on privatisation, due to be
debated in parliament last night. The finance committee has tabled an
amendment restricting any special 'golden share' which the government takes
to eight years.
But the government has sought the right to retain 'golden shares'
indefinitely.

Iceland yesterday devalued the krona, by 7.5 per cent, the country's second
devaluation in eight months, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm.
The move follows a sharp fall in fish prices this year and a government
decision to limit the country's cod catch in the face of declining stocks.
The Icelandic economy is heavily dependent on fishing, with cod accounting
for 30 per cent of exports. The devaluation is relative to a currency
basket, in which the European currency unit has a 76 per cent weighting, the
dollar 18 per cent, and the yen 6 per cent.

Germany will continue the fight against terrorism, following the arrest of a
prominent member of the Red Army Faction, the interior ministry said
yesterday, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin.
The arrest of Ms Birgit Hogefeld, a prominent member of the RAF left-wing
terrorist group, and the shooting dead of Mr Wolfgang Grams by the
anti-terrorist unit, is a welcome boost for security forces.
Ms Hogefeld was arrested at the weekend in the eastern state of
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. A police officer was shot dead during a shoot out in
an operation aimed at trying to find the remaining hard core of 20 RAF
members.
The guerrilla movement, set up in the 1970s, was virtually dormant in the
1980s, but re-emerged after German unification in 1990.
It was responsible for murdering Hans-Martin Schleyer, president of west
Germany's employers' federation in 1977, and Mr Detlev Rohwedder, who was
head of the Treuhand, the agency charged with restructuring and privatising
eastern German industry.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government must tell 'the unvarnished truth', set out clear
targets and provide the necessary political leadership to help break the
downward economic spiral, according to Mr Tyll Necker, president of the BDI
federal industry association, writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt.
All economic indicators were still pointing downwards and cuts in production
and workforces would continue in the coming months, he said yesterday. There
were no signs of any improvement.
Complaining of a crisis of confidence, and alleging that politicians did not
take the business community's appeals seriously, Mr Necker demanded that
Bonn set clear goals.
It should say when and how it would reverse the rise in state indebtedness
and reduce the tax burden. It should also back up its targets with 'concrete
and credible' actions, he said.
'Those who announce their willingness to make savings and at the same time
let loose an avalanche of costs on employment damage their credibility,' Mr
Necker said. Continuous talk of new burdens and taxes shook investors' and
consumers' confidence, he added.
He repeated industry's opposition to proposals for funding care for the
elderly, and complained about looming increases in pensions contributions
and fuel taxes.

The Romanian parliament has rejected an amendment to the foreign investment
law which would have clarified that foreign companies may own land in
Romania, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest.
Parliament did, however, accept an article allowing foreign companies to
repatriate profits in full, removing the previous annual limit of between 8
per cent and 15 per cent.
The Romanian Development Agency (RDA), the state body for foreign
investment, said parliament's decision would not affect investments made in
the past three years.

GERMANY will continue the fight against terrorism, following the arrest of a
prominent member of the Red Army Faction, the interior ministry said
yesterday, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin.
The arrest of Ms Birgit Hogefeld, a prominent member of the RAF left-wing
terrorist group, and the shooting dead of Mr Wolfgang Grams by the
anti-terrorist unit, is a welcome boost for security forces.
The arrest of Ms Hogefeld took place on Sunday night in the eastern state of
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. A police officer was shot dead during a shoot out.
The guerrilla movement, which was set up in the 1970s, was virtually dormant
in the 1980s but re-emerged after the unification of the two Germanys in
1990.
It was responsible for murdering Hans-Martin Schleyer, president of west
Germany's employers' federation in 1977, and Mr Detlev Rohwedder, who was
head of the Treuhand, the agency charged with restructuring and privatising
eastern German industry.

</HEADLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government must tell 'the unvarnished truth', set out clear
targets and provide the necessary political leadership to help break the
downward economic spiral, according to Mr Tyll Necker, president of the BDI
federal industry association.
All economic indicators were still pointing downwards and cuts in production
and workforces would continue in the coming months, he said yesterday. There
were no signs of any improvement.
Complaining of a crisis of confidence, and alleging that politicians did not
take the business community's appeals seriously, Mr Necker demanded that
Bonn set clear goals. It should say when and how it would reverse the rise
in state indebtedness and reduce the tax burden. It should also back up its
targets with 'concrete and credible' actions, he said.
'Those who announce their willingness to make savings and at the same time
let loose an avalanche of costs on employment damage their credibility,' Mr
Necker said. Continuous talk of new burdens and taxes shook investors' and
consumers' confidence, he added.
He repeated industry's opposition to proposals for funding care for the
elderly, and complained about looming increases in pensions contributions
and fuel taxes.
The business community was working on cutting costs and payrolls. 'But
industry also has to warn politicians and unions neither to underestimate
nor to gloss over the extent of our problems,' he said.
Mr Necker's protest coincided with a further worsening in the mood in key
sections of German industry.
The VDMA engineering industry association revised its forecasts for this
year from a real fall in output of 5 per cent to a drop of 8 per cent.
New orders booked in May were 10 per cent down on the same month last year.
The motor traders' association claimed new vehicle registrations in Germany
would fall 23 per cent this year, basing its estimate on a 20 per cent drop
in the first five months.

FT  29 JUN 93 / IMF ready to agree Russian reform aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund is this week expected to agree to grant
Russia the first stage of a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) lending facility, in
the first large wave of international financial assistance to promote
economic reform.
The so-called systemic transformation facility is being prepared so it can
be agreed before next week's summit in Tokyo of the Group of Seven leading
industrialised states.
It is thought the IMF board will meet in the next few days to grant the
facility, which would form the centrepiece of the summit's commitment to
help promote Russian reform.
The pressure on the IMF to agree it has been increased by the stiff
opposition to a US proposal to set up a Dollars 4bn fund to help the
privatisation of big state-owned enterprises in Russia. G7 officials say a
much smaller fund, close to Dollars 500m, is being discussed as a
face-saving measure to satisfy the US administration.
The systemic transformation facility was one of the most important measures
agreed at an April meeting of G7 foreign and finance ministers in Tokyo.
They decided then that it should be available in two tranches of Dollars
1.5bn.
It is conditional upon Russia delivering to the IMF credible promises that
it will tackle inflation, restrict credit to ailing enterprises and reduce
its budget deficit.
G7 finance ministers hope this will help jump-start economic stabilisation
in Russia and so make it easier for Russia to draw upon two further IMF
facilities worth about Dollars 10bn.

FT  29 JUN 93 / BP's talks on Azeri fields suspended: Power vacuum in Baku
halts progress on western oil projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum said yesterday that talks over a Dollars 9bn (Pounds 6bn)
development project for three oilfields in the Azerbaijan sector of the
Caspian Sea had been suspended following political upheaval in the republic.
But the company is optimistic that negotiations will resume in a matter of
weeks.
A BP official said that a team of negotiators from Socar, the Azerbaijan
energy company, had been recalled to the capital, Baku, after spending last
week in London. 'They can't feel comfortable negotiating these sort of
things when the government is being changed. It doesn't surprise us a bit,'
he said. But the government upheaval could lead to changes in officials in
charge of running Socar which could further delay talks, industry observers
said.
Before he was forced to flee Baku, Azerbaijan's president, Mr Abulfaz
Elchibey, had been due in London on Friday to sign a preliminary contract
for the development of the three oilfields. 'We still had many months of
negotiations to go before coming to the final contract,' said Mr Steven
Bertram, financial director of Ramco Energy, which is also involved in the
project.
A group of eight western oil companies is involved in negotiations with the
Azeri government over the oilfields which are believed to contain 4bn
barrels of oil. They had paid Dollars 70m in preliminary payments which BP
said yesterday was being held in an escrow account.
The companies had been talking separately over the development of each
individual oilfield, but at the beginning of June the Azeris said they
wanted the fields to be linked in one development. Mr Bertram said: 'There
are indications the new government may prefer to reopen negotiations for
individual fields.'
Ramco's share price dropped by 36p yesterday to 120p on news of the
disruption to the oil talks. But Mr Bertram said it is still four times the
price it was last October when the group first announced its involvement in
Azerbaijan.
Mr Thane Gustafson, an observer of the Russian energy scene at Cambridge
Energy Research Associates, sounded a note of caution over the oil talks,
saying that any government of Azerbaijan will be unstable until the war with
Armenia over Nagorno Karabkh is resolved. 'I think it will take more than a
couple of weeks to get back to the negotiating table,' he said.

FT  29 JUN 93 / EC tightens van exhaust rules: Catalytic converters will
have to be fitted from next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PASSENGER vans and light goods vehicles in the European Community will have
to be fitted with catalytic converters from next year, environment ministers
decided yesterday. This will bring them into line with exhaust emission
controls on cars and lorries.
Ministers were also aiming to reach a political deal setting even more
stringent emission targets for cars for 1996 and 2000, which carmakers say
would add 5 per cent to manufacturing costs.
The emissions regime for cars, in force since January, is now extended to
new models of van from October, and all newly registered vans from October
1994. It covers passenger vehicles carrying up to nine people and goods
vehicles under 3.5 tonnes. Broadly, current standards seek to cut emissions
of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and carbon particulates by
85-90 per cent from 1970 levels.
Only the Dutch dissented on the vans decision, but from a 'greener'
standpoint. The Netherlands, along with Germany and Denmark, want more
generous fiscal incentives for cleaner cars than now allowed in order to cut
emissions faster. Britain, France, Spain and others fear too big 'green' tax
discounts could distort competition in the EC's single market.
Though there is consensus on the European Commission's approach to cutting
vehicle emissions, disagreement over fiscal incentives loomed last night as
a barrier to an early accord. Under the current vehicle regimes, incentives
have to be 'substantially lower' than the cost of the technology needed to
reach the emissions standard. Despite car manufacturers' cost forecasts,
many EC environment ministries maintain that it is impossible to gauge now
the technology cost of 1996 emission standards - let alone targets for 2000
and after.
Chances of a deal were further diminished because the European parliament
has not yet supplied its opinion, meaning that ministers would have to
decide unanimously. Parliament may be holding out for a greater say in
shaping the deal once the Maastricht treaty is ratified. But when car
emission standards were set two years ago, Strasbourg muffed the chance to
write in the 1996 targets then - which Brussels and the Twelve were disposed
to accept - because it failed to muster a quorum of MEPs for the key vote.
Ministers also agreed on measures to control emissions from petrol
distribution and vehicle refuelling, and were due to discuss better fuel
quality as part of the new generation of emission controls.
There was hope, too, of agreement today on reducing emissions such as
sulphur dioxide and hydrogen chloride and fluoride, through cleaner burning
of industrial waste.

</HEADLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR GINO GIUGNI, Italy's labour minister, warned that crucial talks between
employers and trade unions on a new wage bargaining system had got off to a
difficult final week yesterday, with employers determined to get a
favourable agreement.
The talks, which the government wants to conclude by Monday, have faltered
on difficulties in bridging differences over simplifying the bargaining
system and increasing labour flexibility.
Mr Giugni said: 'The chances of reaching an agreement. . . . have gone
down.' He said yesterday's meeting between ministers and the Confindustria
employers' federation had 'gone badly' and warned that 'big difficulties'
remained. The government would present a compromise document later this
week.
Meanwhile, officials denied weekend reports that Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi,
prime minister, had threatened that the government could fall if the
negotiations failed to succeed.
The government opted for separate meetings with the unions and employers
after trilateral talks last week made only limited progress. Ministers are
due to meet union representatives tomorrow.
However, chances of reaching a settlement have been complicated by internal
difficulties for two of the three union federations. On the first day of its
annual conference in Rome, debate at the big CISL trade union federation was
overshadowed by allegations that Mr Sergio D'Antoni, its leader, had
accepted payments from a leading industrialist implicated in the political
corruption scandal.
Mr D'Antoni said he would contact Milan magistrates opportunity to rebut the
allegations by Mr Vincenzo Lodigiani, a prominent industrialist, that he
paid illicit contributions to the CISL and the UIL union federations.
Separately, internal pressures within the CGIL, the biggest union
federation, mounted as Mr Bruno Trentin, its leader, held out against a
capitulation to employers' demands.

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S Cartel Office yesterday announced a record number of mergers since
unification, but warned they were often hindering competition in eastern
Germany.
During 1991 and 1992, 3,750 mergers were registered at the office, 800 more
than in the previous two years. More than 1,300 enterprises or companies in
the east were merged with western companies, partly to rationalise in
response to the recession, but also sometimes to stem competition in the
five new states.
The Cartel Office, whose powers are confined to judging the validity of a
merger, had managed, however, to challenge 133 takeover or merger cases
under European Community regulations.
The most notable cases questioned by the office, and rejected by the
European Commission, included mergers between Varta, the battery company,
and Bosch, the white goods manufacturer; Alcatel, the telecommunications
group, with AEG Kabel, the electronics concern; Mannesmann with Hoesch; and
Siemens with Philips.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Bulgarian technocrats display their political prowess: The
non-partisan cabinet of Lyuben Berov has survived against all the odds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BULGARIA'S political prospects have brightened after the government of
non-party technocrats managed to beat off an aggressive opposition campaign
for early elections by surviving a critical parliamentary confidence vote.
The strength of the voting last week - 126 to 84 in favour of the reshuffled
cabinet - was unexpected in view of the highly vocal opposition in
parliament to the six-month-old government and its low ratings in opinion
polls. The vote of confidence marks a significant setback for the
anti-communist Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), the country's main
opposition group.
In recent weeks the UDF, whose year-old coalition government collapsed last
October after falling out with its political partners, has frequently called
its supporters on to the streets in an attempt to pressure President Zhelyu
Zhelev into calling fresh elections.
The UDF hoped that the same anti-communist slogans which propelled it to
power in 1991 could once again mobilise strong support in the country. But
with most Bulgarians more concerned about the prospect of another year of
severe economic recession than about party politics, only hardcore UDF
supporters, mainly in Sofia, responded.
Many former UDF supporters have been alienated by the party's bitter attacks
on its former leader, President Zhelev, who is by far the country's most
popular politician. The president himself says that an unforeseen result of
the UDF's anti-government campaign has been to increase support for the
Bulgarian Socialist party (BSP), the former Communist party.
The UDF leadership's radical stance has also split the party and contributed
to the formation of a new centrist group in parliament. This includes 23 MPs
who broke away from the UDF. The centrists showed in last Friday's vote that
they are prepared to co-operate with the socialists and the much smaller
Movement for Rights and Freedom (the party which represents Bulgaria's
ethnic Turk minority) in supporting the government.
Centrist group votes were also on hand earlier this month to help push
through the 1993 budget with a two-thirds majority after three months of
often heated discussion. The vote ratified the government's efforts to keep
the budget deficit to a ceiling of 7.9 per cent of GDP in the face of
demands for higher spending on social security and subsidies.
The political situation remains far from settled, however, with further
splits in both the UDF and BSP expected. 'The situation is in ferment, many
changes are still taking place. The centre has not yet crystallised,' Mr
Zhelev says.
This leaves the government, a cabinet of non-partisan technocrats led by Mr
Lyuben Berov, a 67-year-old former university professor, without firm
support from any of the main political parties. It will therefore remain
difficult for it to move ahead with privatisation and push through laws
needed for economic reform.
The privatisation agency has only just completed its first large
transaction, the sale of a maize-processing plant to a Belgian company,
Amylum, for Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.3m), and claims that several other
projects are well advanced. But western advisers say there is still a lack
of consensus within the government over how best to speed the process and
over which of several rival mass privatisation schemes to adopt. Similarly,
only slow progress is being made to fulfil IMF requirements for the signing
of a new stand-by agreement to replace the previous arrangement which
expired in March.
One critical area is the need for greater financial discipline in the
state-owned companies. State-owned enterprises owe an estimated Dollars 2bn
to the banks and to one another. The delay in tackling this problem is
blocking privatisation by prolonging the life of unprofitable companies and
contributing to the 75 per cent annual inflation rate.
The IMF and the World Bank both want to see headway in introducing
bankruptcy and tax reform laws and tough new banking regulations before
releasing further credits.
Their views are listened to because the support of the big international
institutions is required both to give much needed technical assistance and
to help finance a future debt settlement with the London Club of commercial
bank creditors.
At the latest London Club meeting in Frankfurt, two weeks ago, the two sides
edged closer to an agreement, according to Ms Mariana Todorova, Bulgaria's
debt negotiator.
The Bulgarian side has dropped its original demand for a 70 per cent debt
reduction to 50 per cent. It has also offered to make an upfront settlement
of Dollars 750m on its Dollars 11bn debt.
The banks on the other hand are seeking to limit the debt write-off to 38
per cent and are seeking repayments of around Dollars 400m a year. This
contrasts with the Dollars 250m which the Bulgarian side claims is the most
it can afford.

FT  29 JUN 93 / US says raid serves as warning to terrorists: Iraqi
intelligence capacity 'crippled' in Baghdad strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, JAMES WHITTINGTON and ALISON SMITH

   WASHINGTON, BAGHDAD, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton said yesterday that the weekend US missile strike on
Baghdad was intended as a warning, not only to Iraq but to all governments
which fostered terrorism.
Mr Clinton said he had been advised that Iraqi intelligence capacity in
Baghdad, target of the raid, had been crippled. The US claims that a plan to
assassinate former President George Bush in Kuwait in April had been drawn
up in the Iraqi intelligence headquarters.
One side of the main 10-storey block has virtually collapsed and the
adjoining six-storey building had most of its roof blown away. But the
nearby communications tower was unscathed.
Foreign diplomats in Baghdad said yesterday there was deepening despair in
the population, who had hoped that Mr Clinton's arrival in the White House
might bring a change in US attitudes and an easing of sanctions.
They said the missile strike had come as a shock to most Iraqis, though some
retaliation had been expected by the Baghdad regime following allegations of
Iraqi complicity in the plot to kill Mr Bush. US reconnaissance aircraft had
been seen over the capital for the two days preceding the attack.
Mr Al Gore, US vice-president, in a television interview amplifying Mr
Clinton's warning, said any country contemplating a terrorist action against
the US 'now know that if they do that they're going to get a response'.
Apart from Iraq, US concerns are mostly directed at Iran and Sudan. Mr
Warren Christopher, secretary of state, complained on Sunday that too many
US allies are 'doing too much trading' with Iran, thereby assisting the
build-up of its military capability, possibly including nuclear ambitions.
The Sudanese connection has been highlighted by last week's arrest in New
Jersey of an alleged terrorist cell numbering several Sudanese nationals and
linked to the outspoken cleric, Sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman, who arrived in the
US in 1991 from Khartoum.
The New York Times reported yesterday senior administration officials,
including Ms Janet Reno, the attorney-general, had intervened with the FBI
not to arrest the sheikh, partly on the grounds of questionable evidence
against him and partly because he was felt to be more useful at liberty as a
source of information on Islamic terrorism.
One official was quoted as saying that if it could be proved that Iran
and/or Sudan was behind the New Jersey group then the US response would be
put in the hands of the Pentagon.
Mr Clinton's decision to launch missiles against Iraq has continued to win
general approval, with one instant poll recording support of two-thirds of
the public.
In his brief comments promising that there would be an 'aggressive' response
to terrorism, the president also said he wanted 'to move on to other
matters,' specifically his domestic economic agenda and preparation for next
week's summit in Tokyo of the Group of Seven leading economic nations.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, was forced to defend the
government's support for the attack on Baghdad, insisting that it was a
'justified and proportionate' response. In an emergency statement to the
House of Commons, he came under fire from opposition MPs who declared that
the action should not have had the backing of the UK.
Spokesmen for both the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties warned of its
damaging impact on the role of the United Nations.
Other MPs, including some Conservative backbenchers, voiced concern about
the effect of the attack on relations between western powers and the more
moderate Arab regimes.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Shake-up plan for police authorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT intends to broaden the make-up of police authorities beyond
elected local politicians and magistrates under proposals published
yesterday.
In future, five of the 16 members of each police authority will be appointed
by the home secretary, who will also appoint a paid chairman.
Announcing the white paper proposals in the Commons, Mr Michael Howard, home
secretary, said the reforms were intended to reduce what he called 'paper
pushing' and to improve the crime prevention and detection record of
Britain's 128,000-strong police force.
The proposals, which drew immediate accusations of 'creeping centralisation'
of the police force, include boosting the number of special constables from
nearly 20,000 to 30,000 and freedom for police authorities on how to spend
their share of the Pounds 6.2bn national police budget. The 43 police forces
in England and Wales will also have to publish annual performance results.
Mr Howard vetoed a proposal by Mr Kenneth Clarke, his predecessor, that the
Metropolitan Police should be answerable to a more independent authority,
although a new body will be set up to help him oversee its operations.
He also lowered expectations of an early reduction in the number of police
forces operating in England and Wales.
The reforms, which will be followed tomorrow with the recommendations of the
Sheehy inquiry into police pay and conditions, drew mixed reactions. Mr Tony
Blair, the shadow home secretary, said the proposals were bankrupt and
represented a 'misguided piece of prejudice against local policing'.
Mr Alan Eastwood, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales -
which represents rank-and-file officers - said the white paper would not put
more officers on the beat.
John Burrow, chief constable of Essex and president of the Association of
Chief Police Officers, welcomed greater flexibility in budgets but seriously
questioned the need to reconstitute membership of police authorities.

FT  29 JUN 93 / EC commissioner may seek top job at EBRD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, HUGH CARNEGY and DAVID BUCHAN

   LONDON, STOCKHOLM, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR HENNING Christophersen, the European Community economics commissioner, is
expected to become the first formal candidate to replace Mr Jacques Attali
as president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
The EBRD's Danish director, Mr Lars Tybjerg, yesterday told his fellow board
members that Mr Christophersen, a former Danish finance minister,
hadexpressed interest in the position. Mr Tybjerg gave fellow directors
copies of Mr Christophersen's curriculum vitae.
Meanwhile, Mr Attali, who said on Friday he would resign as soon as a
successor was found, yesterday made an emotional farewell to a meeting of
400 EBRD staff.
He did not mention his resignation in the short speech, but urged staff to
share his dream of creating a peaceful Europe in which the bank would
'create jobs and joint ventures for all . . . Maybe this is only a dream',
he said. 'It was mine, it is now yours.'
A quotation from an 'ancient Persian poet' ended the speech: ''An angel at
night whispered to me in the wind and told me there is no such thing as an
angel whispering to you in the wind'', he said. 'It is up to you now to
listen very carefully and you will hear the angel. It exists.'
It also emerged yesterday that Mr Attali's personal assistant, Mr Francois
Olive, who was responsible for all his travel arrangements and was recruited
from the French interior ministry, has become the first member of Mr
Attali's inner circle to resign.
Mr Christophersen is one of a number of possible candidates to replace Mr
Attali. However, Dr Onno Ruding, the former Dutch finance minister whose
candidacy would be supported by several governments, has told colleagues in
Citicorp, where he is a vice-chairman, he is not interested in joining the
EBRD.
The chairman of the bank's governors, Mrs Anne Wibble, the Swedish finance
minister, is likely to press for the appointment of an interim president, to
allow more time for a permanent replacement to be found, according to
Swedish officials.
Such a temporary appointment, also supported by many of the bank's 23
directors, could take place in the next few days. The directors, who
represent the countries and agencies which own the bank, are likely to call
an emergency meeting to discuss the succession.
'Many of us believe the ideal candidate as interim president is Claes de
Neergaard (the Swedish director),' said a director. 'We may formally
recommend to Mrs Wibble that she appoint him.'
Mr de Neergaard's appointment would be resisted by the bank's executives,
many of whom are lobbying for Mr Mario Sarcinelli, head of development
banking, or Mr Ron Freeman, head of merchant banking.
Mrs Wibble plans to discuss the succession issue with her two vice-chairmen,
the finance ministers of Japan and Slovenia, on July 6. She will also
discuss the sensitive issue of severance terms for Mr Attali.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Boeing challenges Airbus with improved 737 models
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING, the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial jets, yesterday
decided to offer a new family of 737 twin-engine airliners to challenge the
European Airbus consortium's range of twin-engine aircraft.
Although the 737 has been the world's best-selling jet with more than 3,000
aircraft ordered to date and more than 2,500 delivered, Boeing has faced
increasing competition in this market from the Airbus A320 and its bigger
A321 derivative.
The decision was taken in Seattle by the Boeing board, which said it would
offer three sizes of improved 737 aircraft, including a 105-seater, a
130-seater and a 150-seater.
Boeing said that a formal launch of the development programme would hinge on
the company's winning sufficient initial orders. It said it had started
working with more than 30 airlines in 1991 on an improved 737 family.
Airbus has made inroads in the narrow-body market by launching new,
technically more advanced airliners.
Last year, it struck a significant blow against Boeing by winning a Dollars
2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) order for 50 A320 jets from United Airlines, a
traditional Boeing customer.
Airbus also raised the competitive stakes this month at the Paris Air Show
when it launched the development programme for the A319, a smaller, 125-seat
variant of the A320.
The original 737 programme was launched in 1965. The new 737 derivative will
involve a bigger wing, improved powerplant and advanced systems to provide
more range, speed and payload to compete against the improvements introduced
by the Airbus 150-180-seat narrow-body jets.
The bigger engines will be developed by the CFM partnership between General
Electric of the US and Snecma of France.
Boeing had considered developing an entirely new aircraft rather than a 737
derivative. It rejected that option on the grounds of market timing and of
the much higher development costs.
Developing a completely new narrow-body aircraft would cost an estimated
Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn, while the cost of an improved derivative is put at
about Dollars 1.5bn.
Boeing had been under increasing pressure to offer airline customers
improved versions of the 737 in the second half of the decade to coincide
with the expected recovery in the world aircraft market. Boeing said last
night that the first aircraft would be delivered in 1997.

FT  29 JUN 93 / (CORRECTED) FT Exporter (18): Risky states offer some
prospects - The potential for sustained expansion of sales / Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES FAIRRIE and ALAN SPENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 14th July 1993) appended to this article.
LATIN AMERICA is dominated by three main economies, those of Brazil,
Argentina and Mexico, for each of which the US is the main foreign trading
partner, with Germany the principal European supplier of goods.
The region contains six other substantial and growing economies - Chile,
Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador and Venezuela - of varying economic
performance and potential.
Most of South America's economies are capable of lurching from relative
prosperity and stability one year to economic crisis the next, but of the
three main economies Mexico and Argentina perhaps offer the greatest
potential for exporters with an eye for sales growth over the next 18
months.
Brazil has to tackle domestic problems, the resolution of which hinges on a
successful conclusion to the protracted Brady plan debt negotiations. As a
result, it could be some time before it offers good prospects of sales
growth to exporters.
Mexico is the largest importer of the three, with total imports in 1993
expected to exceed Dollars 58bn (Pounds 37.6bn). Semi-manufactures,
chemicals and medicinal intermediate products may amount to Dollars 33bn,
with capital equipment imports forecast to reach Dollars 13bn, and consumer
durables Dollars 8bn. Around 80 per cent of these products are sourced from
the US, and the North American Free Trade Association (Nafta) accord should
cement this dominant position. Payment delays average two to three months.
Mexico has a soaring current account deficit which will reach Dollars 29bn
in 1993 and is forecast to swell to Dollars 35bn in 1994. The trade
liberalisation measures of the 1990s and the structural reforms, including
privatisation, have been responsible in part for this. However, because
capital investment inflows have been so strong - around Dollars 15bn is
forecast for 1993 - total debt servicing of around Dollars 11bn in 1993
should be comfortably manageable. The peso has remained strong because of
high domestic interest rates, currently 14 per cent, and this, in turn, has
encouraged companies to finance capital expenditure with equity, rather than
bank loans. Germany, with 5.7 per cent of Mexico's imports, and France, with
2.5 per cent, are the country's main EC trading partners.
Argentina, with a GDP of Dollars 283bn, growing at 6 per cent a year, and a
low inflation rate by historical standards, of 12.5 per cent, is enjoying
increasing economic success. The main doubt is the large current account
deficit, the growth of which is being exacerbated by the government's
determination to fix the peso at par with the US dollar. This affects labour
costs which will have to fall to relieve pressure on the country's
competitiveness.
Imports, at Dollars 14.5bn in 1992, are growing at more than 20 per cent a
year, although the sharp cut in the expansion of M1 money supply so far in
1993 (13 per cent in 1993 from 49 per cent in 1992) should force households
to adjust their expenditure to a dwindling supply of domestic credit. Of the
Dollars 17.8bn of imports expected in 1993, around Dollars 6.4bn will be
manufactured product imports. However, payment delays are tending to worsen
 -currently up to four months in 1993 from three months in 1992.
Export credit agencies continue to offer a fairly generous volume of cover.
Germany's Hermes, for instance, is believed to have more than Dollars 180m
of short term cover, and the US Export-Import Bank (EximBank) has
underwritten around Dollars 70m of short term commitments.
This month, the UK Trade Secretary, Michael Heseltine, announced in Buenos
Aires the resumption of ECGD medium term cover for Argentina, commenting
that the move had been made possible now that Argentina had negotiated its
official and commercial bank debts, and was 'a recognition of the country's
success in implementing its economic reform programme'.
Elsewhere in the region, the other key economies in terms of GDP and
population size are Colombia (population 36m; GDP Dollars 50bn); Chile
(population 14m; GDP Dollars 40bn); Peru (population 22m; GDP Dollars 47bn);
Venezuela (population 20m; GDP Dollars 64bn); Ecuador (population 11m; GDP
Dollars 14bn) and Bolivia (population 7.5m; GDP Dollars 6.75bn). Exporters
and trade financiers are currently likely to find Bolivia, Ecuador and
Venezuela less satisfactory markets than Chile, Peru and Colombia.
Bolivia is facing a high trade deficit, lengthening payment delays - from
three months last year to current levels of around five months - and a
worsening relationship with the IMF as its structural adjustment programme
falters in the shadow of the forthcoming elections.
Ecuador is contending with high inflation, high currency risk, low foreign
exchange reserves, worsening exchange transfer delays, increasing political
unrest, and high foreign debt: its debt to GDP ratio is now over 100 per
cent.
Venezuela is struggling to handle a big public sector deficit, a high
current account deficit, a debt to GDP ratio of 58 per cent, and an
over-reliance on petroleum product exports.
Chile, meanwhile, has introduced structural reforms necessary to reduce its
debt and improve its internal domestic finances. Inward investment has
boomed as the Government has embarked on a determined privatisation
programme, and mineral and food exports were growing rapidly until falls in
world prices began to dent prospects of further growth in 1993.
Nevertheless, import volumes are set to maintain their growth. Imports now
total Dollars 11bn, of which capital equipment comprises Dollars 2.6bn and
energy products a further Dollars 1.3bn. Germany is the EC's main exporter
providing 6.5 per cent of all imports. While the current account is in
deficit to the equivalent of 4 per cent of GDP (Dollars 1.6bn), this is
readily financeable, and, with Dollars 12bn of projects under active
development, export credit insurance is widely available among most of the
main credit insurers.
Colombia, with imports running at Dollars 7.5bn per annum (of which
intermediate goods comprise Dollars 3.5bn and capital equipment Dollars
1.7bn) is a sound market into which EC exporters are selling vigorously at
the present time. With high foreign exchange reserves (Dollars 7.3bn),
import cover at eight months and transfer delays at less than two months, it
is now producing few problems for credit insurers.
However, potential problems loom. Inflation is stubbornly high at 25 per
cent, and next year's presidential election, already vigorously contested in
the media, is creating political uncertainty. In turn, the latter is
delaying decisions on Colombia's two main domestic policy issues - how to
diversify the economy away from its reliance on oil, and how to improve the
productivity of Colombia's ailing State Oil Company, PDVSA, where
privatisation proposals are on hold.
Peru may be a more attractive target for exporters from the EC. Following
the recent election of President Fujimori, it is set for a period of
stability and growth. With a population of 22m and a GDP of Dollars 46bn,
now growing at 3.1 per cent a year, it offers useful prospects, particularly
for exporters associated with the power, construction and the fishing
industries. These are the expected growth sectors as privatisation plans
release pent-up demand.
Although Peru does have a high foreign currency debt - its debt to GDP ratio
is on the high side at 47.8 per cent - servicing at 2.4 per cent of GDP is
not a daunting problem in the light of the capital repatriation taking
place, following the election. Foreign investment is likely to be attracted
by plans not only to privatise the two electricity utilities, but also the
mining conglomerate Centromin, and the telecoms authority EntelPeru.
Many bankers feel that Peru is well placed to settle its Dollars 7.5bn Paris
Club rescheduling this year, and could then draw down its recently approved
IMF extended fund facility as well as Dollars 1bn of World Bank loans. A
Brady Plan restructuring is expected to be negotiated towards the end of
1993. EC export credit agencies are reassessing their country limit
availabilities for Peru, following the improvement in the country's economic
prospects.

FT  28 JUN 93 / People: Rubik's new puzzle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hungarian Investment Company, the investment trust run by fund managers
John Govett, has recruited 48-year-old Erno Rubik, the inventor of the Cube
and other puzzles, on to its board as its third Hungarian non-executive out
of a complement of eight directors. He replaces Peter Reiniger, a Hungarian
trade minister, who is now at the EBRD.
Kevin Pakenham, John Govett's chief executive, says that one of the aims was
to achieve as wide a mix of skills as possible; Rubik is someone who 'does
not just look through a financial pair of eyes'. Other board members include
Sir Bryan Cartledge, former ambassador to Budapest and then Moscow and now
principal of Linacre College Oxford.
Rubik, who is based in Budapest, is currently managing director of Rubik
Studio, a business centre involved in product design and development, which
he opened in 1988. He has indicated he is anxious to widen his circle of
international business contacts and this is thought to be his first
directorship of a foreign company.
Since the trust was launched at the beginning of 1990, it has fallen 5 per
cent in net asset value terms, but the Hungarian bourse, hit by recession
particularly in the crucial German market, has fallen much further. The
index, published only since the beginning of 1991, is down 30 per cent in
nominal terms, while the consumer price index has risen 67 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH ecologists, battered by failure in elections three months ago and
divided over whether to stay independent or to forge alliances with the
Left, met over the weekend to chart a course for the future, Reuter reports
from Paris.
Mr Antoine Waechter, Greens leader, and Ms Dominique Voynet, viewed as his
challenger, sought to minimise their longstanding differences as the party
began a two-day gathering in Paris.
Ms Voynet said she did not envisage a fusion with Socialists, as called for
earlier this year by Mr Michel Rocard, Socialist party caretaker leader, but
simply wanted a clear opposition to face conservative Prime Minister Edouard
Balladur.
'We have to risk opening up, but that does not mean renouncing the
independence we have always favoured,' Ms Voynet told the meeting of some
570 party activists.
Mr Waechter, whose camp has the edge over Ms Voynet's among party militants,
said he did not define independence in the same way. But the differences
would help 'enrich' the party, he said.
The Greens' standing slumped in the March general elections that swept the
Socialists from power and gave a centre-right coalition a crushing
parliamentary majority.
The Greens had an election pact with rival ecologists, Generation Ecologie.
However, in spite of pre-election predictions of strong results, the
combined ecologists garnered less than 8 per cent of the vote and failed to
win a single seat.
The Greens' customary respect for democracy in party proceedings meant some
140 issues were put down for voting on Saturday - on amendments to a text on
the party's strategy and identity.

<TEXT>
GREEK police rounded up more than 4,500 Albanians in a 48-hour sweep and
have begun expelling the suspected illegal refugees, the Public Order
Ministry said yesterday, Reuter reports from Athens.
Tension between the neighbouring Balkan states has risen sharply since
Friday, when there were reports of clashes between ethnic Greeks and
Albanian police in the southern Albanian town of Gjirokaster.
Greece said the violence was sparked by Albania's expulsion of a senior
Greek Orthodox priest, Chrysostomos Maidonis. Greek officials said the
violence was one of the worst ethnic Greek-Albanian clashes since the second
world war.
'The Albanian action proves this country is shamelessly violating human
rights,' said Foreign Ministry undersecretary Virgina Tsouderous.
Police were holding many of the illegal Albanians at the Hellenikon Air Base
at Athens international airport and private coaches were being hired to take
the refugees to the border.
Between 150,000 and 300,000 illegal Albanians are thought to be in Greece.
They walk across the long, rugged border and often return quickly after
being expelled by Greece.
Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis has reacted angrily to the deporting
of the priest on Friday, calling it an 'unwarranted provocation' and warned
Albanian authorities that Greece would 'take whatever step it deems
necessary'.
The sweep of Albanian immigrants began after the warning by Mr Mitsotakis.
Greece also announced that planned trips to Albania by Foreign Minister
Mihalis Papaconstantinou, National Economy Minister Stephanos Manos and
Defence Minister Ioannis Varvitsiotis were being cancelled.

MR Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, yesterday set out the
achievements of his one-year-old coalition government in an effort to
bolster waning public support.
In an address to the nation, broadcast live on state-run radio, Mr Rabin
conceded he had failed to deliver his electoral promise of a peace
settlement with Palestinians and Arab neighbours within six to nine months.
But he said substantial progress had been made in the negotiations and that
there was 'no other road'.
'Maybe I was wrong when I gave too short a time period to reach a settlement
and I raised too many expectations,' Mr Rabin said.
He said the government had boosted internal security by its 'permanent
closure' of the occupied-territories, improved relations with Washington,
secured the Dollars 10bn US loan guarantees and restructured economic
priorities towards spending on infrastructure and education.

BULGARIA detained a Romanian ship on suspicion of carrying up the Danube
River goods banned under a United Nations embargo against former Yugoslavia,
Reuter reports from Sofia.
The state news agency BTA reported that the Romanian ship Jariste 5, with
860 tonnes of iron, was detained by Bulgaria's river inspection authorities
at Vidin, 50km downstream from the Serbian border.
The ship was sailing upstream from the Romanian Danube port of Calarasi to
Turnu Severin, a Romanian port opposite Serbia, without UN sanctions
committee approval to take embargoed goods through the Serbian section of
the river.
Several embargo-busting Yugoslav tugboats towing barges laden with tens of
thousands of tonnes of petrol products eluded control by Bulgarian and
Romanian customs on the Danube and sailed into Serbian waters three months
ago.
The US Coast Guard gave Bulgaria three fast boats in response to requests
for help to enforce the embargo.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Journalist's RSI case starts today
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST legal claim brought by a journalist over repetitive strain injury
will be heard in the High Court today.
Mr Rafiq Mughal, 44, is suing his last employer, the Reuters news agency,
for compensation.
RSI is a term used to describe various disorders of the hands, arms,
shoulders and neck. Such injuries have increased in recent years following
the widespread introduction of computer keyboards in workplaces.
Mr Mughal, who became severely affected with RSI in 1988, has not worked for
the past four years and claims that he has lost more than Pounds 85,000 in
salary.
He is backed by the NUJ journalists' union, which has a large number of
pending RSI cases that are likely to be affected by the outcome of this
week's hearing. The pending cases include a small number of current and
former Financial Times journalists.
Mr Mughal said he has suffered 'terrible pain' and is still unable to carry
out simple household tasks.
He added: 'New technology has been introduced at great speed with little or
no consideration for the health and welfare of those who use it.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Survey of World Automotive Suppliers (10): Strong interest
in new products - Mark Payne on the car of the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK PAYNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWSPAPER and magazine features on 'the car of the future' usually outline
futuristic technology applications. While there is a host of futuristic
technologies which will one day be used in mass car production, there also
already new product areas on the threshold of a global 'take-off.'
Anti-lock braking systems (ABS) have been with us for some time, although a
period of unprecedented growth in new applications for these systems is
under way. According to figures from the Varity Corporation's Kelsey Hayes
group in Livonia, Michigan, the global ABS market will treble in size for
the period 1992-97, growing from an estimated 8.2m units to a projected
24.1m units by 1997.
North American installation rates will rise to 77 per cent by 1997, compared
with 30 per cent in 1992. For western Europe, the comparable figures are 58
per cent and 22 per cent; in Japan, they rise from a slender 9 per cent in
1992 to 33 per cent by 1997.
The reasons for these surging sales are enhanced vehicle safety and
declining real unit costs as volumes increase.
Airbags are another safety-related product area which is set to become one
of the biggest growth markets in the 1990s. Airbags, designed to inflate in
milli-seconds in the event of a vehicle crash and to cushion the driver -
and increasingly, passengers, too - from chest and head injuries, are
rapidly making their appearance in quite modest vehicles. In north America,
legislation on airbag fitment provides further market impetus.
TRW Repa of Alfdorfin Germany has market projections which suggest that the
level of airbag system sales at the original equipment level in north
America, Asia and Europe will amount to 20m units in 1993. By 1998, the
company expects this total to treble to 60m units.
Among this year's sales, 12m units are expected to be driver-side airbags,
and perhaps 8m passenger-side airbags. By 1998, the total driver-side airbag
market is forecast to grow to 33m units, and the passenger-side market to
26m units.
Multivalve technology is a third sector which offers considerable growth
prospects for suppliers. The design and development of passenger car and
light truck engines which feature more than the standard two valves per
cylinder is expanding quickly. Although several numbers of valves can be
employed, the norm for the future is becoming the four-valves per cylinder
engine, in view of the various technical advantages conferred by this
configuration.
There are big benefits in multi-valve technology: not only can engine power
output be boosted for a given cylinder capacity, but this factor alone
relaxes the previously- accepted rules of engine physical
size/capacity/weight/power output relationships. Quite simply, a smaller
engine - with all the attendant cost and design/styling flexibility which
that allows - can be used to obtain greater power output than would
otherwise be the case with traditional valve configurations.
The converse of this is that an engine of the same physical size with four
valves per cylinder can be used in the manufacture of a far more powerful
vehicle than would otherwise be the case. Another benefit of multivalve
technology is the potential offered both for emissions reduction and fuel
economy.
Projections by TRW Valves in Wednesbury, West Midlands, illustrate the
growth potential of the multivalve sector: in 1992, average engine
penetration in the passenger car and light truck sector was over 13 per cent
in western Europe.
By 1998 the company expects the level to rise to more - than 30 per cent of
such engines fitted in West European output. In numerical terms, TRW Valves
expects the number of engines featuring multivalve technology to grow by
around 180 per cent, to over 5m units by 1998 compared with 2m in 1992.
Projected levels for the UK are far higher than the west European average,
at 35 per cent in 1992 and over 70 per cent projected for 1998.
Electronic control systems for diesel engines: these developments are being
spurred by issues such as emissions control and fuel economy. Lucas
Automotive, which has developed its EPIC fuel-injection system for passenger
cars, is forecasting that, by the year 2000, all diesel-engined cars
built-in western Europe will have some form of electronic control.
According to Lucas Diesel Systems, in order for such engines to meet the
1999 European emissions regulations, even small cars will have to feature
electronically-controlled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) to achieve
compliance. Lucas predicts that diesel penetration amongst the west European
cars and light vans will rise from 26 per cent today to 33 per cent by the
year 2,000; worldwide penetration will increase from 18 to 22 per cent.
Legions of other forward-looking systems and component areas offer suppliers
substantial market opportunities for the next few years - they include gas
discharge lamps, multiplexing, electronic suspension or ride control,
electronic tyre pressure inflation systems, traction and new control
systems, automatic transmission control, limited-slip differentials, steer
by wire systems, vehicle navigation systems, anti-collision radar and
recyclable plastic parts.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Survey of World Automotive Suppliers (9): The tide has
turned - As business has melted away in the home market, British component
groups are increasingly active on the international front, and have
demonstrated a willingness to take a long-term view of prospects / European
vehicle producers look more favourably to the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR WAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK COMPONENT producers have implemented radical measures to restructure
their operations over the past 20 years in response to the serious erosion
of domestic vehicle production.
Output of cars and commercial vehicles in the UK during 1992 amounted to
little more than 1.5m units, compared with just over 2.3m in 1972.
Nevertheless, production last year was noticeably ahead of the depressed
levels seen in the mid-1980s when annual output typically hovered around the
1.2m level.
Adding to the woe has been a trend whereby the responsibility for purchasing
decisions at Ford and General Motors (Vauxhall) has been removed from the UK
and relocated into Germany although this is being reversed in the case of
Ford. This occurred largely as a consequence of the UK component industry's
uncompetitiveness throughout much of the 1980s.
It follows that many of the parts for Ford's and General Motors' British
plants which were traditionally sourced from UK companies have been sourced
from Germany instead.
At the same time as they have seen business melt away in their home market,
UK component producers have had to respond to the gradual but inexorable
evolvement of a global motor industry, which in turn is being accompanied by
the development of an increasingly international components sector.
This has intensified still further competition in the domestic market and
necessitated heavy investment in overseas production facilities in order to
secure the economies of scale in manufacturing required to sustain
increasingly expensive and vital research and development programmes.
Leading executives in the components industry believe that the process of
globalisation will result in worldwide parts supply being concentrated into
as few as 100 world-class companies, each a technological leader, resting on
sound financial foundations and backed by an international spread of
production facilities.
The interesting question is how many of them, if any, will be British owned
and controlled?
At present it is possible to identify only a limited number of candidates -
obvious ones being BBA, GKN, Lucas and T&amp;N.
It is by no means certain, though, that all will maintain their independence
in the global restructuring process. Lucas, in particular, has been widely
mooted as a takeover target. All four are noticeably different in size and
structure compared with just a few years ago.
Recessionary conditions have forced them to adopt a variety of moves.
Workforces have been reduced, plants closed, fringe activities divested,
resources focussed on to areas of technological excellence and international
expansion pursued.
A good example of what has happened is seen with Automotive Products, which
has undergone extensive restructuring since being acquired by BBA in 1986.
The aim has been to reduce dramatically the cost base, thereby achieving a
substantial improvement in competitiveness. To this end the workforce has
fallen from about 8,000 to 4,500 worldwide, stockholding reduced massively
and a highly centralised management structure replaced by autonomous
operating units, each with responsibility for profit.
There has been heavy spending on manufacturing technology and a high
priority placed on what may best be termed commercially appropriate
technological development.
Moreover, the company's philosophy now emphasises the need to be
customer-oriented.
The effectiveness of these changes may be judged from the increasing level
of new business which is being won - running at Pounds 70m on an annual
basis, much of it from continental competitors - as well as the latest
financial figures which show that pre-tax profits in 1992 amounted to Pounds
16.2m compared with a loss of Pounds 1.1m in 1991 when operating profits of
almost Pounds 9m were completely eroded by exceptional items and interest
charges. And these encouraging trends are evident in other groups throughout
the UK components sector, both large and small.
British component groups are increasingly active on the international front,
and have demonstrated a willingness to take a long-term view of business
prospects.
The faltering state of the German motor industry, for example, has not
deterred T&amp;N from acquiring the German piston ring producer Goetze, thereby
consolidating its position as one of the world leaders in engine parts.
There have been important expansion moves in North America, too.
Looking ahead, UK component groups have two golden opportunities to boost
their standing in the world league. These arise from: first, a boost to
exports as a result of the competitive edge afforded by sterling's departure
from the ERM; and secondly, the prospect of growing business as Japanese
assembly plants build up their activity in the UK.
Both factors are also significant in making the country an attractive
location for investment by foreign component groups.
Export potential in the short term will undoubtedly be limited by dull
economic conditions in continental Europe, but sterling's devaluation has
added considerably to the attractiveness of the UK as a source of component
supply. This is especially true for German vehicle producers, not least as
they seek to reduce costs through more effective sourcing policies.
Recently the Volkswagen group - comprising the Audi, Seat, Skoda and
Volkswagen marques - declared its intention to double purchases of
components from UK companies to DM1bn (Pounds 400m) by the end of 1993.
Further rises to DM2.5bn (Pounds 1bn) are anticipated in the period to 1995,
representing around 5 per cent of the group's total component purchases.
This move has been prompted mainly by the realisation that savings of up to
40 per cent are achievable through sourcing from the UK.
European vehicle producers generally are looking more favourably towards the
UK as a potential source of components.
In addition to cost considerations, there is a growing appreciation of the
sector's technological capability and capacity for original thought, which
is increasingly important in the context of vehicle manufacturers' greater
dependence on their suppliers to arrive at technical solutions.
Credentials have been furthered by the extensive network of production
facilities operated by UK companies in Europe. For all the talk of a single
market, having a local presence when pitching for new business remains
important.
However, it is the arrival of the Japanese car assembly plants in Britain
that provides the UK components industry with the greatest promise of future
prosperity.
Where local (European) sources are used, UK component producers are set to
enjoy by far the largest slice.
Indeed, the combined annual purchase of components in the UK by Honda,
Nissan and Toyota is expected to total close to Pounds 1.3bn in 1995, and
there may be more to come.
After so much gloom and doom, it appears the tide has turned. The hard work
and difficult decisions of recent years are about to be rewarded.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Survey of World Automotive Suppliers (7): German producers
in turmoil - A rough ride is forecast for even the most progressive
suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ADAM OPEL, the German subsidiary of General Motors, recently conducted a
survey of its components suppliers to see what they thought of the Lopez
medicine. As the earliest 'victims' of the attentions of Mr Jose Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortua, now production and procurement chief at Volkswagen, they
might have been expected to post back some tetchy responses.
In the event, most felt their operations, and crucially, their
competitiveness, had been improved by Opel's internal efficiency drive in
which Mr Lopez played a central role in seeking to reduce the cost of
bought-in parts. Some even claimed they were able to compete with suppliers
in other countries to provide components to Japanese car makers.
Despite the clouds of anxiety stirred up by the controversial arrival of Mr
Lopez at VW, there is ample hard evidence that German components makers have
already started determinedly to act to restore their competitiveness.
Indeed, the process began even before Mr 'Strangler' Lopez arrived on the
scene.
ITT Automotive, for example, the widely-scattered parts division of the US
ITT group, started last September on a restructuring programme. Originally
intended to come into operation next year, it was unveiled ahead of schedule
a month ago.
The key strategic shift was to merge ITT's five German businesses, focusing
them, together with other non-German subsidiaries involved in brakes and
electrical systems, around the operations of Teves, the world's main
supplier of anti-lock braking systems. The shift brought 25 factories and
the lion's share of ITT Automotive's turnover under the command of Mr Klaus
Lederer, currently head of Teves.
The main reasons, Mr Lederer says, were to strengthen ITT's bargaining
position with vehicle makers, and, by doubling the German-based operation's
own annual purchasing total, to increase its negotiating power vis-a-vis its
own suppliers. Just as vehicle makers are working on reducing the numbers of
suppliers to their factories, Mr Lederer has given himself two years to
reduce his list of 2,000 outside parts makers by 30 per cent.
At the same time, ITT is stepping up its programme of making mainly
labour-intensive or relatively unsophisticated products outside Germany.
Projects under way or in advanced planning stages include works in Portugal,
Hungary, the Czech Republic and Shanghai. Part of the aim is to cut costs,
but the main impulse behind the overseas investment has come once again from
vehicle makers. The Chinese plant, for example, is being built in a joint
venture arrangement to supply a nearby Volkswagen assembly works. The core
business, however, will remain in Germany, despite the much-criticised high
wage costs. As Mr Lederer pointed out, labour accounts for only 8 per cent
of the manufacturing costs of ABS systems.
The ITT strategy represents in concentrated form a process which is under
way throughout the German components industry, which currently consists of
some 3,000 largely medium-sized manufacturers, representing 40 per cent of
European capacity, with sales of some DM130bn a year.
The net effect of larger suppliers' transplanting capacity to factories
abroad and the growing squeeze on profits as vehicle makers and bigger
component companies persist with demands for lower prices, will be a rapid
erosion of this core industry. Many are too small to survive alone. The 100
largest of the group account for 84 per cent of the industry's turnover.
A grim new analysis by Price Waterhouse in Germany projects that only 500 of
the total will emerge from the coming storm of structural change as viable
businesses. Of these, around 100 will be 'systems-' or in VW jargon
'first-tier' suppliers, providing their customers with complete
sub-assemblies. Although many appear to be modelling themselves on the
Japanese competition, German car makers typically have direct contacts with
1,000 to 1,800 suppliers, compared with 160 to 300 among the Japanese. While
the domestic industry endures this process, opportunities will emerge for
foreign investors to take a hand. PW forecasts that non-German companies
will have important stakes in half the front-line companies. At present,
fewer than a quarter of Germany's top 100 suppliers have a foreign parent.
Once again, the process of change has been under way for some time, prompted
by fading profitability. According to the research department at Deutsche
Bank, German vehicle prices rose 26 per cent between 1985 and 1992: in the
same period, parts prices increased only 11 per cent. Further figures from
PW demonstrate that during this period of continuing boom for the German
motor industry, the components makers had an increasingly thin time of it.
Average return on sales nose-dived from more than 5 per cent in 1987 to 1.5
per cent in 1991.
This period was marked by a series of rapid strategic shifts, including
takeovers, joint ventures, and increasingly a shift overseas. The Mannesmann
engineering group, for example, is still digesting a heavy recent intake of
new acquisitions, including Fichtel &amp; Sachs, VDO Adolf Schindling and Boge.
Krupp took its unsuspecting neighbour Hoesch by surprise when it launched a
successful takeover bid while the two were discussing friendly co-operation.
The result is a substantial components business to ease the pain of the slow
retreat from the two companies' old core business in steel manufacture.
Despite today's atmosphere of turmoil, Deutsche Bank sees a sound and
prosperous integrated industry emerging when the dust settles. According to
the bank's Mr Rainer Much, the two halves of the industry are fated to a
future characterised by 'co-operation instead of conflict'. Rationalising
the demands being made on parts makers, he says vehicle makers and their
suppliers will conclude long-term pacts rather than short-term contracts.
Suppliers with the right products and technology - that is, the most
progressive and innovative - will benefit from the increasing tendency for
car makers to fit more expensive comfort and safety options in their
products. But none is likely to find the ride to this promising new future
anything but rough.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Survey of World Automotive Suppliers (8): French shake-out
under way - 'This could be the industry's worst year of the decade'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK PAYNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON the surface, the French automotive components industry had a reasonable
year in 1992, although there have also been some suggestions that the sector
was heading for difficulties in view of such factors as the 'franc fort'
pegged to the strength of the Deutschemark within the ERM; a shake-out of
the number of suppliers to both Renault and the PSA group; and the downward
pressure on the prices of bought-in components exerted by France's vehicle
manufacturers.
The most worrying factor for 1993, however, has been the steep downturn in
vehicle output which has characterised the first few months.
Staring at the abyss by late 1992, the components industry has seen
production in France of passenger cars fall by 13.6 per cent in the four
months to the end of April, as compared with the performance of the
comparable period of 1992.
In the commercial vehicle sector, production has performed worse still, with
output falling 30 per cent.
A succint statement from the Federation des Industries des Equipements pour
Vehicules (FIEV - the Automotive Equipment Industry Association) says it
all: '1993 has started very badly, and all the signs are that the year could
turn out to be the most difficult of the decade.'
According to FIEV, sales in 1992 by French automotive equipment
manufacturers increased by a provisionally-estimated 5.6 per cent to the
all-time record level of FFr78.8bn.
Within this total, original equipment (OE) sales to French vehicle
manufacturers accounted for a little more than half - with OE sales
increasing by a provisionally-estimated 3.4 per cent.
This was, however, below the 4.2 per cent increase in the number of vehicles
manufactured in France last year, which was the first time this phenomenon
has occurred - to the chagrin of the French components industry, this
relative decline was made all the worse in view of the accepted trend of
growth in the value of sales per vehicle manufactured in France.
Price pressures from Peugeot, Citroen and Renault on their components
suppliers was responsible, with French vehicle manufacturers under
increasing pressure to reduce their costs.
Renault suffered a pre-tax loss of FFr961m in the fourth quarter of 1992
owing in part to a FFr600m loss in franc revenue as a result of the strength
of the franc against the lire and sterling.
For 1993, Renault expects a further currency-induced reduction of FFr3bn in
taxable income. First quarter 1993 income at Renault was only one-tenth that
of the comparable period of 1992.
PSA Peugeot-Citroen saw a 39 per cent decline in profits during 1992. As the
auto equipment association says, 'since 1991 our auto-makers have increased
their pressure on (components) prices, and the favourable trend from which
we previously benefited has been destroyed by the reductions which we have
been obliged to grant them.'
Not all has been, or is, gloom for the French components manufacturers,
however. During 1992, 'aftermarket' sales within France rose by 3.5 per cent
after having effectively stagnated in 1991. This reflects the positive
effect on parts sales of the introduction of mandatory vehicle-testing
procedures.
In addition, sales by French components producers to other (generally
'first-tier') suppliers rose during 1992 by 37.2 per cent to FFr1,100m in
what looks like becoming, as a result of structural changes in the pattern
of supply, a substantial area of business in the 1990s.
Direct exports of components from France increased by 9.1 per cent in 1992
to a provisionally-estimated FFr26.6bn, although it is difficult not to
wonder for how long such a performance is possible if the franc continues to
remain one of Europe's stronger currencies (and especially in view of the
German vehicle manufacturers' desire to reduce costs sharply and speedily).
Even though relative costs within the French components industry are
generally lower than those in Germany, they have become still lower in
certain other countries since the ERM upsets of the autumn of 1992 (and most
especially so in the UK).
The Michelin group is by far the largest components manufacturer in France,
as well as being the world's leading tyre maker, and it has been affected by
the 'franc fort.'
During 1992 global sales were steady in volume terms, but turnover fell by
1.2 per cent to FFr66.8bn as a result of the strengthening franc against the
dollar, lire and sterling.
In the second half of last year, adverse exchange rates were a big factor
behind the group's move back into loss - another was a contraction in the
tyre market.
In the first quarter of 1993 the group saw volume sales of its tyres fall by
an alarming 14 per cent. This has led the company to introduce an emergency
rationalisation programme which has included short-time working in France
and the announcement of a reduction of 2,950 in Michelin's French workforce
to 1995 - which has come after 16,000 job losses worldwide over 1991-92.
France's largest non-tyre components group, Valeo, was able to look back on
1992 with some satisfaction, although the company's chairman, Noel Goutard,
has recently sounded a note of caution for 1993. In 1992 group sales
increased by 4 per cent to FFr20.6bn, of which 56 per cent derived from
outside France.
Adverse exchange rate fluctuations, however, pared an estimated 2 per cent
off turnover, which would otherwise have grown by 6 per cent. Group net
profit in 1992 rose by 26 per cent to FFr753m. For 1993, as a result of the
condition of the European motor industry, Mr Goutard has said that 'our
customers are becoming more and more demanding. Valeo intends responding to
these new challenges through cost-cutting, quality and innovation.'
This is including a reduction in the number and/or size of Valeo's European
industrial facilities during 1993.
Over the first four months of this year, Valeo's consolidated sales fell 5.1
per cent as compared with the comparable period of 1992. The second-largest
non-tyre components group in France is Epeda-Bertrand Faure - which is also
the world's leading vehicle seating manufacturer  - which achieved a 15 per
cent growth in 1992 automotive sales to FFr9.1bn (78 per cent of group
total).
Profitability of the group was affected in 1992 by such factors as exchange
rate losses arising from the effects of the September currency devaluations.
During the first four months of 1993 group auto sales were 9 per cent lower
than in the comparable period of 1992.
For the medium-term however, EBF has - in common with most of France's
larger automotive groups - already moved to minimise geographical market and
currency risks by establishing or acquiring a number of facilities in
several vehicle manufacturing countries of the world.
Domestic sales for French auto components in 1991 and 1992 were FFr50,214m
and FFr52,200m respectively.
Direct exports: FFr24,377m in 1991 and FFr26,600m in 1992.
Total sales: FFr74,591m in 1991 and FFr78,800m in 1992.
For a list of larger European component suppliers with auto-related sales of
at least Dollars 1bn, see page three.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Survey of World Automotive Suppliers (6): Search for new
alliances - Japan's component suppliers feel the strain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
TIMES are getting tough for Japan's automotive components makers. A
three-year downturn in domestic demand has hit hard at the finances of
Japan's leading automobile assemblers.
The slump from the very high rates of growth of the late 1980s is expected
to be followed by only very weak growth in the next few years as Japanese
manufacturers face protectionist limits on their exports and largely
replacement demand at home.
As a result, car assemblers are embarking upon restructuring plans. These
moves pale in comparison with the sweeping job cuts announced by the German
car makers such as Daimler Benz and Volkswagen. But in the Japanese context
they are quite radical.
Nissan's decision to close its Zama production plant in 1995 and transfer
production to a more modern, under-utilised plant in Kyushu, the
southern-most island is the most radical step yet taken by a car maker to
cut costs. Nissan plans to shed 5,000 of its 53,000 staff in the next three
years.
Meanwhile all car makers are re-assessing the marketing and manufacturing
strategies which made them successful in the 1980s, but only at a cost.
The Japanese car makers added fixed costs in the 1980s as they expanded
their share of the world market. These costs were mainly due to the high
costs of making a wide range of very different models, with many variations.
The downturn has exposed these high fixed costs. Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, the
president of Toyota said recently the company would reduce the number of
styles on individual models and standardise components to cut costs.
More models will share common components. Most car companies have announced
plans to cut the number of components they use by about 30 per cent over the
next few years.
The main casualties of this rationalisation are unlikely to be the direct,
lifetime employees of the car companies. Toyota for instance plans to cut
costs without reducing its workforce of 74,000. The main burden will be born
by sub-contractors which make components.
Nissan estimates that sub-contracted components account for about 70 per
cent of its manufacturing costs, compared with the 60 per cent share claimed
by leading European manufacturers. With such a high proportion of costs
outside the boundaries of the company, Nissan will target component makers
as a significant area for costs-saving.
Japanese component makers are used to bearing the strain of responding to
down-turns in demand with cuts in the prices of the components they supply.
But this time it could be different. Car makers are likely to embark on a
more far-reaching rationalisation of sub-contracting which will bring
winners and losers.
According to Mr Kenneth Courtiss, chief Asian economist at the Tokyo branch
of Deutsche Bank, leading Japanese car makers are planning to cut overall
production costs by 30 to 40 per cent in the next few years, compared with a
target of up to 20 per cent in the European industry - 'the Japanese car
makers are preparing a new productivity miracle,' he says.
THE source of this productivity improvement is likely to come from shifting
even further to modular production, with entire sub-systems made off-line
and inserted into the model. Large subcontractors who make sophisticated
systems will probably benefit. They are likely to form ever-closer
relationships with the final assemblers.
The people likely to suffer are the thousands of smaller, commodity
components makers which cluster around plants like Zama. Often no more than
back street workshops run by family companies, these suppliers are likely to
feel the pinch of the car assemblers' move towards more standardised
components.
The pressures are already prompting car manufacturers and components makers
to consider new relationships and alliances. The trade pressure which Japan
is under, combined with the rising cost of developing technologically
advanced sub-systems for cars, means that foreign suppliers may figure
slightly more in the Japanese supply system in future.
Nissan, for instance, is strengthening its alliance with the German car
components maker Robert Bosch, which has bought a stake of almost 10 per
cent in a leading Nissan supplier, Unisia.
The company is expected to become a leading Nissan supplier by combining
Unisia's existing brake technology and Bosch's engine control electronics.
The size of the deal, which is worth about Y5.14bn is not the best measure
of its significance.
More important is the way it changes Bosch's role: it is shifting from being
a mere supplier of alternators to Nissan to become deeply involved in the
development of electronics systems for Nissan cars.
Toyota will soon start design development with Ford, which could lead the
Japanese group to use Ford components in its car for the first time. Toyota
will study whether to use Ford's cruise-control technology. Toyota already
buys components such as shock absorbers and radiators from General Motors.
Its current supplier of cruise-controls is Nippon Denso, its affiliated
supplier.
Mitsubishi Motors is planning to use engines and transmissions manufactured
by Chrysler, the US vehicle group.
MEANWHILE, the downturn is also forcing the Japanese suppliers to search out
new alliances. Vehicle assemblers are increasingly considering larger
components and sharing some model production: Nissan and Mazda will swap
light vehicles and trucks, for instance.
These alliances among vehicle makers are in turn forcing components makers
to consider alliances, too. Japanese car manufacturers maintain dedicated
chains of suppliers. The lack of overlap among suppliers constrains their
volume and makes their costs higher than they would be.
The walls between suppliers for different car makers may be starting to
crumble, ever so slightly. Nissan in May took the unprecedented step of
agreeing to buy parts from a supplier affiliated to Toyota, its arch rival.
Nissan will buy about Y1bn of parts from Aisan Industry an affiliated
supplier in which Toyota has a large minority shareholding.
The deal is small and it does not come into force until 1995 but it could
pave they way for other car manufacturers to break through the strict
demarcation lines between suppliers. Nissan said it made the move because
the vacuum pumps made by Aisan are more reliable than the pumps it currently
uses.

AFTER building up a sizeable assembly, presence in North America during the
1980s, Japanese vehicle manufacturers are focussing their attention on
Europe in the 1990s. Based on existing proposals, output of Japanese-badged
vehicles in Europe will amount to almost a million units a year during the
latter part of the decade, spread through four countries - Hungary (Suzuki),
the Netherlands (Mitsubishi), Spain (Nissan and Suzuki) and the UK (Honda,
Nissan and Toyota).
It is likely, moreover, that other ventures will be announced during the
next few years to boost the volume still further.
Rumours suggest that some of the smaller Japanese producers will link up
with European partners to produce specialist models, and it is widely
anticipated that Mazda will enter the European assembly arena in some form,
despite its recent failure to reach an agreement with Ford.
One unknown is the extent to which the Japanese have set their sights on
producing in eastern Europe where the potential for market development is
enormous. It is also possible, of course, that Honda, Nissan and Toyota may
expand capacity, either at their existing facilities or on new sites.
By far the most significant developments to date have taken place in the UK
where both Honda and Toyota commenced car production towards the end of last
year. Together with Nissan, which began UK production in 1986, it is
estimated that these three will be producing more than 500,000 cars a year
at their British plants in 1995.
Clearly this represents a massive new business opportunity for their chosen
component suppliers. For European - and especially British - component
producers, the good news is that most requirements will be procured from
local sources.
Toyota estimates that it will be purchasing parts and assemblies from
European suppliers to the value of Pounds 700m when its assembly target of
200,000 cars a year is reached in 1997. In addition, the company will be
spending Pounds 50m annually in Europe on raw materials.
Toyota has 160 European-based suppliers at present from ten countries in the
European Community and Efta. Slightly more than half are from the UK and
just over a quarter from Germany, while France accounts for around 17. The
majority of these companies are European-owned, with 12 Euro-Japanese joint
ventures and seven Japanese-owned operations making up the remainder.
Local content - defined as the value of the car at the factory gate, less
the Toyota content - amounts to 60 per cent currently and is scheduled to
rise to 80 per cent at the end of 1994, six months earlier than originally
planned.
Nissan's assembly facilities in north east England are supplied by 198
European-based component producers, with no less than 132 operating from the
UK.
Other notable supplying countries are Germany (29), France (13) and Spain
(11). Trailing far behind are Belgium, Ireland and Italy (three each), and
Austria, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden (1 each). The relatively
strong showing of Spain reflects Nissan's assembly presence in the country,
and points to the company's purchasing function assuming a growing European
dimension.
Already steel is procured on a combined basis for both Spanish and UK
operations, and it is probable that each location will become the lead buyer
for designated parts and assemblies.
European-owned companies have the lion's share of the business.
Of Nissan's 198 European suppliers, 139 have no links at all with Japanese
component producers, 24 have a technical agreement, 12 have a commercial
agreement and 12 are joint ventures. Only 11 are wholly owned by Japanese
groups.
This year, Nissan anticipates spending Pounds 850m on components in Europe,
based on the assembly of 270,000 cars. Local content amounts to around 83
per cent for the two models produced in the UK - Micra and Primera.
The position is broadly similar at Honda whose British assembly facility
sources from 150 European-based suppliers, (70 per cent of them British).
Local content amounts to about 60 per cent presently. But as output builds
up to the planned 100,000 units in 1995, local content is scheduled to rise
to 80 per cent. At that stage Honda anticipates spending close to Pounds
500m a year with European component producers.
It is clear that the Japanese have not been noticeably parochial in their
choice of suppliers and have provided European companies with fair
opportunities to win the business. This contrasts markedly with the position
in North America where the establishment of Japanese vehicle assembly
facilities has been accompanied by extensive investment by Japanese
component suppliers.
In addition to supplying the Japanese vehicle producers in North America,
the expectation was that the US components sector would be something of a
pushover, allowing contracts to be secured from the Big Three vehicle makers
(Chrysler, Ford and General Motors). However, this has not happened to any
significant degree, and instead many have over-extended themselves both
financially and managerially.
Japanese component producers' approach in Europe therefore has been more
cautious. There is a lot of respect for the technical and manufacturing
competence of European component producers, and a corresponding
understanding that any attempt to barge in with heavy investment on
greenfield sites would be a sure way of losing money.
Also, it appears that Japanese vehicle manufacturers have provided their
component producing compatriots with scant encouragement to set up new
facilities in Europe, not least due to the political sensitivity of such
moves.
Instead, Japanese component groups with a mind to establish a European
foot-hold have tended to favour co-operation rather than confrontation with
their European counterparts. Thus a web of joint ventures, equity stakes and
licensing agreements has evolved, and in some cases there have been full
scale takeovers.
In setting up their European assembly operations, Japanese vehicle producers
have been meticulous in choosing their component suppliers. Toyota started
its selection process in May 1989 - 3 1/2 years before output commenced -
with a survey of local suppliers.
An important characteristic of Japanese vehicle producers is their genuine
desire to establish a spirit of mutual trust with their suppliers, as
manifested in long-term relationships.
Another notable feature is the Japanese companies' policy of setting up
technical support teams to help in the development of production systems at
suppliers. A key objective is to achieve continuously improved productivity
levels.
There is also the chance for European component suppliers to develop
business through direct exports to Japan and other assembly plants of
Japanese manufacturers worldwide. One of the most celebrated instances
concerns Bosch whose factory in Wales supplies the alternator for all Micras
built in Japan, as well as those produced in the UK.
Toyota reports that several European component producers have won business
for the supply of parts for Japanese-built Carinas. As yet, though, the flow
of European components to Japan is strictly limited - and it would be wrong
to suppose that the business will develop significantly - but the examples
so far indicate that there is some potential.
If there is any cloud on the horizon for the European components industry it
is that success for the Japanese assembly plants may be countered by
declining business among some of the less competitive European vehicle
manufacturers.
The impressive rates of productivity and concomitant low unit costs achieved
by Nissan's UK operations are likely to be replicated eventually by Honda
and Toyota, with the result that the threat of closure will hang over the
region's less efficient vehicle producing plants.
But for British component suppliers - still licking their wounds as a result
of the erosion of the UK's vehicle manufacturing sector over the past couple
of decades - the arrival of the Japanese presents the opportunity to restore
former fortunes. The evidence to date indicates that the opportunities will
not be lost.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Survey of World Automotive Suppliers (4): Painful
adjustments in US - The Big Three vehicle assemblers battle to reduce costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<TEXT>
THE US automotive parts industry is in the throes of a long and painful
consolidation wave which is likely to eliminate many of the sector's weaker
players but leave the strongest and most efficient companies significantly
more profitable.
The process has been going on for the past decade, which has seen the number
of North American suppliers dwindle from around 3,000 to 2,000, but it has
been intensifying recently, due to new pressures from the Big Three US
vehicle assemblers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler.
Faced with fierce competition from Japanese rivals, all three have been
seeking to reduce their costs and improve the quality of their products.
As a result, they are anxious to cut the number of their suppliers,
focussing on those that can deliver good quality at the lowest cost, and
form longer-term relationships with them. Contracts are increasingly being
awarded to a single source for the life of a model, rather than to several
vendors for two or three years as in the past. The buyers are also
increasingly prepared to look outside the US, sourcing parts on a global
basis.
At the same time, the Big Three, anxious to cut their in-house costs, have
been farming an increasing amount of responsibility for engineering and
testing components to their most important, or first-tier suppliers.
Chrysler has taken a lead in bringing component suppliers into the teams
developing new models at an early stage of design, which has helped build
relationships between the two sides as well as raising its quality and
lowering its costs.
Ford has a goal of reducing its supplier-base by roughly a third during the
first half of the decade.
But it is General Motors which has caused the biggest upheaval in the
industry over the past year, thanks to the actions of Mr J. Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua, who was appointed to the new post of Head of Worldwide Purchasing
for the company just over 12 months ago, (see profile, left).
Mr Lopez, who was wooed away from GM to Volkswagen in March of this year,
set about radical change in GM's relationships with its suppliers.
He demanded price cuts from them of 20 per cent or more but in return
offered long-term contracts to those which could meet his quality
specifications. He also initiated a system under which 'hit squads,' called
Picos teams, went into supplier factories and gave them advice on improving
their productivity.
All this stirred up considerable resentment among suppliers, some of whom
maintained they were already thoroughly efficient and that price cuts 'would
merely encourage manufacturers to cut corners, lowering the quality of GM
vehicles.'
But Mr Jack Kirnan, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, pointed out recently
that 'the best top-tier suppliers have adopted cost-saving ideas that more
than offset the price concessions they are giving back to the original
equipment manufacturers, or they've gained enough additional work to ensure
that their margins remain very healthy.'
Furthermore, the best suppliers are also being helped by changes in the US
automotive industry. First, the sector is recovering gradually from the
sharp recession of 1991, with car and truck sales in May up 14 per cent on
the same period of last year.
Vendors' sales have been recovering. According to a recent survey by the
weekly Automotive News, 44 of the top 50 parts suppliers increased their
sales in 1992, relative to 1991.
Second, the effects of the recovery are being accentuated by the fact that
the Big Three are beginning to claw back market share from Japanese rivals,
who rely heavily on Japanese parts suppliers. The turnaround is due both to
better US quality and to a sharp rise in the value of the Japanese Yen
relative to the dollar.
Third, the huge Japanese trade imbalance with the US and sabre rattling by
the new Clinton administration is putting increasing pressure on Japanese
assemblers to buy a greater proportion of their parts from US suppliers, be
these for use in their US or Japanese plants.
There may also be sound economic reasons for the Japanese assembly plants in
the US to increase their purchases from American vendors. The rising Yen
means it is increasingly costly for them to import components from Japan.
Well over 400 Japanese parts manufacturers have set up shop in the US,
primarily to serve the Japanese factories located in North America, but many
observers believe a substantial number of these are losing money, and there
are rumours that one or more might sell out to American rivals.
Finally, the most efficient suppliers should benefit from a trend at all of
the Big Three to reduce the amount of parts they make in-house. The trend is
likely to be most marked at General Motors, which still makes some 70 per
cent of its own parts, often in a far less efficient manner than outside
vendors.
Mr Lopez began a programme of Picos efficiency workshops at GM's in-house
facilities, but hints that GM might sell off some of its parts operations,
or use outside suppliers, has stirred up strong union opposition. The
company will need to tread extremely gingerly in tackling the issue.
Nevertheless, the writing is on the wall - for GM no less than other parts
manufacturers - and many analysts expect the number of US suppliers to
dwindle to 1,200 or less by the turn of the century.
As Mr James Lohman, chief executive of window system supplier Excel
Industries, observed recently: 'Auto-makers are leaning more on fewer
suppliers that are technically innovative, have world-class quality and are
globally competitive.
'For vendors that fail to meet these expectations, time has just about run
out.'

FT  28 JUN 93 / Survey of World Automotive Suppliers (3): Cutting costs with
gusto / Profile of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, Volkswagen's new chief of production and
purchasing, is the most controversial figure to have made waves in the world
automotive parts industry in many years, writes Martin Dickson.
A Spaniard from the Basque country, his fame stems from May of last year
when General Motors plucked him out of its successful European operations to
help the huge task of turning around its loss-making North American
automotive operations.
Mr Lopez, appointed as GM's head of worldwide parts purchasing, set about
the task with such gusto, and using such unusual methods, that he stirred up
immense controversy among GM's US supplier base. And he caused no less of a
stir in March this year when, following five days of tug-of-war between GM
and Volkswagen, he quit the US company for the German one.
Since joining Volkswagen, he has announced plans to build a 'laboratory
production facility' in Spain which would test new methods of producing a
small car in less than 12 hours.
Vokswagen and GM have become embroiled in a heated legal dispute over Mr
Lopez, with the US company accusing him of taking with him proprietary
information which belongs to it. He denies this.
Whatever the truth, there is no denying the positive effect Mr Lopez had on
GM's cost base during his 10 months in North America. He is estimated to
have saved the company well over Dollars 1bn by forcing suppliers to cut
their prices.
However, his psychological impact on GM may have been even more valuable.
Arguably more than any other single individual, he brought home to both GM's
employees and outside vendors that the company had finally begun changing
its bureaucratic ways, and there could be no backsliding to the old order.
He was personally unconventional. He called his staff 'warriors,' encouraged
them to eat a diet high in fruit and low in potatoes, and said he would wear
his watch on his right arm until GM was back in profit. He lectured
suppliers on the supposed 'crisis' facing the US motor industry and sent
'hit squads' of productivity experts into suppliers' factories to advise on
improving their performance.
All this was designed to force GM into a new, and far less cosy relationship
with its US suppliers. Mr Lopez demanded big price cuts from them, of up to
20 per cent or more, but in return promised long term contracts.
He had already had plenty of experience in changing supplier/assembler
relationships. As head of parts purchasing for GM in Europe, based in
Russelsheim, Germany, between 1988 and 1992, he was a key member of the team
which turned GM Europe from losses into one of the world's most profitable
vehicle businesses.
He sharply altered GM's relations with European suppliers, shifting a large
quantity of work from high cost German components companies to cheaper
manufacturers in other parts of the region.
Such a history made him particularly attractive to Volkswagen, which needs
to drastically reduce its cost structure. Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman of
the Volkswagen management board, said in a recent interview: 'We got to know
each other and established we think alike . . .For Lopez and me it is not a
question of money. It's about maintaining Europe as a centre for
manufacturing industry, to defend it and make it number one in the world
again.'

FT  28 JUN 93 / Survey of World Automotive Suppliers (2): Outlook remains
bleak - West European car production is falling sharply
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WITH the west European new vehicle market in deep recession, forecasts for
demand are becoming more gloomy month by month. Carmakers see little sign
yet of the steep fall in sales, suffered in the first half of the year,
coming to an end.
West European new car sales plunged by 17.9 per cent in May, the fifth
successive month that demand had fallen steeply from the corresponding
period a year ago.
In the first five months alone more than 1m fewer new cars were sold in west
Europe than in the same period a year ago with sales dropping by 17.3 per
cent to 5.15m according to industry estimates.
The harsh picture in the European car market is also reflected in the
commercial vehicle sector, where sales are estimated to have fallen by 25
per cent year-on-year in the first three months.
As each new forecast deepens, the industry's pessimism about the immediate
outlook, carmakers appear to be reaching a consensus that west European car
sales in 1993 could drop to a level as low as 11.4-11.6m from the 13.5m
achieved last year, a decline of at least 14 per cent.
The long years of strong sales have come to a more abrupt end, than even the
pessimists had feared.
New car demand in west Europe bounded from one record year to another during
the second half of the 1980s with sales jumping from 10.17m in 1984 to
13.47m in 1989. For another three years from 1990 to 1992 demand held steady
around the record level of 13.5m.
Beneath the deceptively calm surface, however, all was not well as demand
trends began to diverge greatly in key markets. Sales in the UK slumped by a
third from the 1989 peak with the early onset of recession, while an
unprecedented surge in new car sales took place in Germany, Europe's biggest
market, in the wake of unification. The German car market jumped from 2.8m
in 1989 to 4.2m in 1991 and held at 3.9m last year.
The German party has ended, however, with sales dropping by around a fifth
in the first five months this year, and the UK has become virtually the only
market across west Europe, where new car sales are currently rising.
Sales were lower than a year ago in 15 of 17 markets across west Europe in
the first five months of the year.
In Germany, sales in the period fell year-on-year by 20 per cent, in Italy
the decline was 21.1 per cent, in France 18.5 per cent and in Spain 31.2 per
cent. The flickering of recovery in the UK - with sales up by 8.9 per cent
this year - pales against declines of this magnitude elsewhere.
DRI Europe, the London-based automotive analyst group, says in its latest
monitor report in June that 'with European markets in a state of flux' it
has been forced to revise downwards its 1993 forecasts with new car demand
in Europe now expected to contract by 14 per cent to 11.6m.
'The poor results for April and May have once again renewed fears within the
industry about the scale of the downturn now affecting Europe.'
West European car production is falling sharply, as manufacturers respond to
the deepening recession, but there are still excess stocks. According to DRI
'despite widespread short-time working in the first quarter of the year
stock levels are still considered to be on the high side.' It forecasts that
west European car production, net of double counting, is expected to fall to
11m units this year, a decline of at least 13 per cent from 12.7m in 1992.
'Sales have dropped so quickly that it has been difficult to cut back line
rates with the same vigour. Consequently, stocks still remain high. The
outlook for production remains bleak with widespread extended downtime over
the summer holiday expected.'
DRI sees only modest prospects for a pickup in sales in 1994 with carmakers
and components suppliers having to wait until 1995 for the new car market in
west Europe to begin to stage a recovery.
Its latest forecast suggests that sales will rise by only 1.7 per cent next
year to 11.8m from this year's very depressed level of 11.6m.
Demand is forecast to recover more firmly in 1995 and 1996 with increases of
around 7 per cent a year, but it will be 1996 before sales finally return to
the level of the beginning of the 1990s reaching around 13.55m. Demand is
forecast to continue rising during the late 1990s to 14.86m in 1998.
The current weak level of demand is expected to persist next year largely as
a result of a continuing contraction of sales in both Germany and Italy, the
two biggest European car markets. Demand in Germany is forecast to fall from
3.9m last year to 3.17m this year and to only 3m in 1994. DRI forecasts that
new car sales in Italy will fall from 2.37m last year to 1.94m this year and
to 1.89m in 1994.
'There are increasing concerns over the future direction of the German
economy with the current downturn in the market not expected to turn around
before 1995,' says DRI.
The pace of the decline in west Europe is the most striking feature of the
present development of the new car market worldwide, and is the chief factor
behind the expected contraction in worldwide new car sales this year to
33.3m from 33.9m last year. World sales peaked at 35m in 1990.
Despite an unconvincing start to the year, car sales in the US have begun to
pick up in April and May. In the first five months sales have risen by 2.7
per cent after a lack-lustre performance in 1992, when car sales rose by
only 0.4 per cent to 8.2m. DRI forecasts that demand will strengthen in the
remainder of the year with sales rising in the full year by around 8 per
cent to 8.9m.
The main surge of activity in the US in the last 18 months has come in the
light truck market, where many vehicles are bought as alternative passenger
transport. While car sales stagnated last year, light truck sales jumped by
12.4 per cent to 4.67m and accounted for 36 per cent of the combined car and
light truck market. This resurgence, which disproportionately benefits the
domestic US industry with GM, Ford and Chrysler dominating the market, has
continued in 1993 with truck sales jumping by 17.9 per cent in the first
five months.
While recovery in North America is gathering pace, the main source of growth
in the world market is the Asia Pacific region - excluding Japan where sales
are expected to fall again in 1993 for the third year in succession.
Particularly strong expansion is forecast in China, Malaysia and Thailand,
backed by further significant growth in Taiwan and South Korea.
For the whole of the Asia Pacific region, excluding Japan, the DRI forecast
suggests that new car sales will rise by 21 per cent this year following a
jump of 16 per cent last year. Further increases are forecast of around 12
per cent a year in both 1994 and 1995 with sales rising from 2.45m in 1992
to 4.1m in 1996 and 4.7m in 1998.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Survey of World Automotive Suppliers (1): Shockwaves keep
coming - The pressures from hard-hit vehicle makers are inevitably forcing a
far-reaching restructuring of the components industry. Parts makers are
drastically cutting the numbers of their own suppliers and are also moving
towards global sourcing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE bruising legal battle betweeen General Motors and Volkswagen, the
biggest car makers in the US and Europe, over the services of Mr Jose
Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua has concentrated a harsh new light on the
critical relationship of the world's leading vehicle makers with their
components suppliers.
The conflict over Mr Lopez, formerly global purchasing director for GM and
since March VW's purchasing and production director, has arisen as two of
the world's top four vehicle makers are fighting to cut costs in order to
staunch heavy losses, (see profile, page three).
The world's car and commercial vehicle makers in North America, Europe and
Japan are facing an unprecedented financial squeeze in the face of weak
demand and the intensifying pressures of a global market.
With 50-70 per cent of the production cost of a car being accounted for by
components and materials bought from outside suppliers, it is the automotive
components makers that are in the direct firing line, as the vehicle makers
seek to make good the damage that is being wrought in their own profit and
loss accounts.
Last year the biggest shock-waves in the automotive components sector were
passing through General Motors' army of suppliers in North America, as the
ailing giant of the US industry started to take drastic action to staunch
its record losses.
This year the tremors have reached Europe, where Volkswagen is being forced
to undertake a wide-ranging restructuring of its operations, especially in
Germany, where it has become Europe's highest cost volume carmaker.
The leading actor in both dramas is Mr Lopez. In spring last year he was
plucked by GM in Detroit from its European operations to head its newly
instituted worldwide purchasing organisation. He also became a member of
both of GM's key North American and European strategy boards.
His reputation for tough cost-cutting and an innovative approach to forcing
greater efficiency out of GM Europe's suppliers, was quickly borne out in
Detroit.
His supporters claimed that Mr Lopez was implementing a long-overdue
shake-up of GM's ties with suppliers. But some parts makers accused him of
undermining their relationship with GM by putting existing contracts up for
renegotiation and demanding unrealistic improvements in what they argued
were already good productivity records and thin profit margins. During his
ultimately brief sojourn in the US, Mr Lopez claimed that many US parts
manufacturers were less competitive than those in Europe and were indeed
capable of huge productivity improvements. GM was trying to form a new,
closer partnership with its best suppliers, including advising them on
efficiency and offering long-term contracts, he argued.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, the chairman of the management board of the troubled
Volkswagen group since January, was clearly impressed by the efficacy of the
Lopez approach to dealing with suppliers, and became convinced that he was
the man he needed to help him lead a new industrial revolution at the German
carmaker.
Stung by its loss of a key executive along with seven other members of the
Lopez team, GM is seeking retribution through the courts in Germany, where
Mr Lopez is now under investigation by the public prosecutor for alleged
industrial espionage, including the removal of hundreds of confidential GM
documents detailing the manufacturing costs of each of Opel's plants in
Germany along with the individual prices its pays for around 60,000
different components.
GM's allegations have been robustly rebuffed by VW, and publicly Mr Piech is
giving his unqualified support to Mr Lopez.
The battle between GM and VW must now be decided in the courts, but the
wider battle of the industry to cut costs and increase efficiency and
quality will be played out in every relationship between the vehicle makers
and their myriad suppliers.
The pressures on GM and VW are being felt by all vehicle producers, and the
crucial relationship between the assemblers and their suppliers is being
fundamentally transformed. The leading vehicle makers are creating global
operations, forcing the component producers to match this international
expansion if they wish to maintain their central supplier roles.
The makers are trying to bring new products to the market faster by reducing
product development time, and the suppliers must play a key role in meeting
this goal.
The vehicle manufacturers are seeking to spread more of the research and
development burden for new products on to the component makers. The leading
suppliers are taking on the role of being systems producers, rather than
suppliers of individual components. They are needing to commit themselves
early in the product development cycle, working closely with the carmakers
through simultaneous engineering, so that they are integrated into both the
design and manufacturing engineering processes.
Longer-term partnerships are emerging linking the vehicle producers with
favoured key suppliers, but replacing the old adversarial relationships is
not always proving easy.
In the present case of Volkswagen, for example, the German carmaker insisted
this month that the answer lay in pooling 'the mutual interests of suppliers
and manufacturers by intensifying co-operation between them.'
Mr Lopez claimed that 'our policy is one of partnership, not of opposition,
since this is a matter of survival for us all.'
Some component makers facing demands from Wolfsburg for price cuts of up to
30 per cent over the next three years may retain a justifiable scepticism
about how fairly the burdens of cost cutting are to be shared, but there is
little doubt of the rigour with which VW is launching its new approach. Its
conversion to new ways of conducting its purchasing operations has come
late, so it must move even faster than its rivals, if it is to catch up.
It is planning a drastic reduction in the number of its component suppliers,
as it seeks to rationalise its production and purchasing operations.
According to Mr Piech, VW is seeking to move to a system in which some of
its leading suppliers will become so-called 'logistical partners'. These
first tier suppliers will take over responsibility for supplying complete
modules rather than individual components.
'Around the year 2000 our group will have 100-200 logistical partners.
Toyota has 220 logistical partners today,' says Mr Piech. At present, the VW
division alone has 1,500 suppliers; and Audi, the group's executive car
division has around 800.
Since the arrvial of Mr Lopez, VW has moved quickly to start to build a
global purchasing organisation with the aim of cutting its costs and
reducing its dependence on its high cost German supply base.
Volkswagen has created seven purchasing centres around the world. The
regional purchasing offices have been set up to serve all four of the
group's brand divisions, Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and Skoda, and under the
Lopez system all the groups will be seeking to scour their regions for lower
cost suppliers at high levels of quality and service.
The regional teams will include buyers individually specialising in
electrical, mechanical and chemical components and in plant equipment and
general supplies.
According to Mr Frans Boot, head of the recently established VW group
purchasing office in the UK, the group is seeking to standardise many
components across model ranges to cut down the current unnecessary
proliferation of parts - 'we want to benefit from high volumes.'
The pressures from the vehicle makers are inevitably forcing a far-reaching
restructuring of the components industry. Players in the first tier of the
industry are undertaking similar actions to the vehicle makers themselves.
They are drastically cutting the numbers of their own suppliers and are also
moving to global sourcing as the pressure for rationalisation rapidly moves
down through the ranks of the sector worldwide.
The industry, traditionally highly fragmented, is starting to become more
concentrated. The biggest groups are growing through acquisition - as
witnessed most recently by the UK group T&amp;N's purchase of Goetze, the German
piston ring maker.
At the same time large corporations for which the auto industry has
previously played a somewhat peripheral role, such as Siemens and
Mannesmann, are moving rapidly into specialist areas of the automotive
components sector, where they can bring their technological and financial
strengths to bear.
According to a recent Economist Intelligence Unit study some 65 companies
now have sales in the automotive components sector in excess of Dollars 1bn
a year and this group alone accounts for more than 55 per cent of a total
worldwide industry turnover estimated at around Dollars 400bn.

FT  28 JUN 93 / EC troops must regroup
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON

<TEXT>
First, a health warning. Last week at the Copenhagen Summit the European
Community may have passed an important turning point. Most specialists are
wary of turning points, which should only be administered in small doses:
too many at once, and the reader gets giddy. So, before we go deeper into
this heady stuff, a little story.
The date is 1854; the place is the steep terrain south of the river Bulganek
in the Crimea; enter General Lord Cardigan and General Lord Lucan,
quarrelling furiously with each other and with the commander-in-chief, Lord
Raglan, over the leadership of their forces, the management of the British
and the conduct of the war.
The army had struggled across the Black Sea from Bulgaria, and landed in
confusion in Calamita Bay. The troops, incapacitated by cholera and
dysentery, were dying like flies under the burning sun. The logistics were
appalling: salt pork for rations, too little transport and a water shortage.
On their right flank, the French 'impatiently drummed and tootled',
according to the account* of Cecil Woodham-Smith, and sent over to inquire
about the delay.
Still quarrelling, Lucan and Cardigan led their advance guard of four
squadrons of cavalry up from the shores of the Bulganek. As they came over a
crest half way up the long slope, they saw ahead of them a body of 2,000
Russian cavalry and prepared to do battle.
But, from a higher vantage point behind them, Lord Raglan saw what Lucan and
Cardigan could not see: on the plateau at the top of their slope were
marshalled 60,000 Russian infantry, two batteries of artillery, a brigade of
cavalry, and nine troops of Cossacks. In a panic, Raglan ordered the cavalry
to withdraw again to the Bulganek to regroup and reconsider. For the first
time, perhaps, the British began to reassess the enterprise they were
embarked upon.
EC member states may be undergoing a similar experience. For decades they
have been riven by dogmatic quarrels over Europe's internal organisation.
After four years of considerable effort and occasional Euro-centric
euphoria, they are struggling to bring their Maastricht treaty to land, even
though it is unseaworthy, decimated by currency upheavals and stricken with
referenda and constitutional revisions. Labouring up the hill what do they
see? One billion Chinese, that's what.
Last week in Copenhagen, possibly for the first time in their history, the
12 spent more mental effort looking out than looking in. They were
frightened by what they saw. What they saw fundamentally challenged notions
of the welfare state and social market economy. They saw a future in which
western Europe may simply be uncompetitive and affected by low growth and
rising structural unemployment.
The threat does not come solely, or even mainly, from exports from China or
any other developing country. Rather, the threat to European competitiveness
results from patterns within industrialised countries - from modern
technology, computerisation, telecommunications, the mobility of capital and
incentives to go off-shore - as much as it does from trade flows. Indeed,
the latest figures show China running a trade deficit. But China's size and
a combination of its high economic growth and its low production costs
indicate the kind of competitive pressures developing globally.
Western Europeans used to say: 'Gosh, the Koreans (Taiwanese, etc) are
competitive, we can't match them.' But unconsciously they consoled
themselves with the thought that the Four Horsemen of south-east Asia were
comparatively small economies. China is quite a different matter. And,
whereas labour costs in Taiwan or Singapore are something over Dollars 5
(Pounds 3.30) an hour, compared with Dollars 16 in France or the US and
Dollars 25 in Germany, Chinese labour costs are only Dollars 0.44 cents an
hour.
The grim economic outlook seems to be provoking near-panic in some
continental European countries. The new conservative government in France,
which started its period in office with tax increases to control the budget
deficit, has now virtually turned 180 degrees with the launch of a large
public loan to finance job promotion.
In Germany, the government has approved a DM20bn (Pounds 8bn) savings
package, including cuts in unemployment benefits, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl
has told German workers to stop whining and be prepared to work longer
hours.
The severity of Europe's economic difficulties means the EC will probably
spend less time arguing about dogma and more considering how European
economies can become competitive again; how they can increase growth and
reduce unemployment; and whether they can afford their welfare states.
Mr John Major could not resist cheap gibes last week at the EC's expense -
as if Brussels were to blame for the uncompetitiveness of the UK economy.
The others probably realised, however, he was playing to the Conservative
party gallery.
But, a dispassionate look at Europe, in the context of the global economy,
shows the real differences between Britain and the original Six are trivial.
British politicians are imprisoned in an antediluvian anti-Brussels
mind-set. By most measures - the structure of the economy, taxation levels
and public spending - Britain is obviously a western European country like
the others and its problems European problems. With luck, the Copenhagen
meeting will mark both a truce in the wearying arguments between the
federalists and the nationalists and the beginning of real frankness on
Europe's common problems.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Time to rediscover Ludwig von Mises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In recent years the work of Friedrich von Hayek, the late Austrian economist
and social philosopher, has become steadily better known. Hayek, however,
did not generate his ideas in a vacuum. He was the product of a long
intellectual tradition, the so-called 'Austrian school' of economics which
originated with the work of Carl Menger in the 1870s. It is curious,
therefore, that although Hayek is now internationally recognised, the work
of his teacher and mentor, Ludwig von Mises, remains largely unknown.
If Mises is remembered at all, it is for being the first economist to argue
cogently that rational economic calculation would be impossible under
communism. In later life Hayek admitted that it was Mises's book, Socialism,
published in 1922, that had converted him from the socialist theories then
fashionable in Vienna. In a recent FT viewpoint (May 20) Samuel Brittan
reviewed Mises's critique of socialist economics. But there is much more to
Mises than his attack on communism; he spent most of his life making
positive arguments in favour of free markets and capitalism.
A little personal history may help put Mises in perspective. He was born in
1881 and published a classic book on money and banking as early as 1912;
sadly it was not translated into English until the mid-1930s by which time
most of its main arguments had been popularised by Hayek. Mises was never an
ivory tower academic; indeed for 25 years he was the 'Terry Burns' of
Vienna, serving as the senior economic adviser to a series of Austrian
governments. In his spare time he ran a regular Friday evening
'Privatseminar' that attracted many of Vienna's rising academic stars and
gave him a platform to attack another orthodoxy he despised, the 'logical
positivism' of the so-called Vienna Circle.
The rise of Nazism destroyed his world, forcing him to flee first to Geneva
and then, in 1940, to the US. Unknown in America and contemptuous of the
Keynesian economic theories then in vogue, he was unable to get a full-time
academic post. But he continued writing and lecturing until shortly before
his death in 1973. His 900-page magnum opus, Human Action*, which contains
asides on everything from religion to the nature of creative genius, was
published by Yale University Press in 1949.
There were a few appreciative reviews. The Economist, while nervous of
Mises's libertarian conclusions, could not help admiring the force and
clarity of the book's argument: 'Intellectual power roars through it like a
great wind; it has the impetus of first-rate polemic and the impeccable
coherence of Euclid,' it declared. Professional economists, however, totally
ignored Mises's work: it was literary when they wanted half-baked maths; it
was broad when they were excruciatingly narrow; it was laisser-faire when
they were gung-ho interventionists.
Mises believed the political disasters of the 20th century were a direct
result of a loss of faith in the classical liberal philosophy espoused by
thinkers such as David Hume and Adam Smith. (Austrian economics,
incidentally, is really English since it is an extension of their work.) He
felt this loss of faith occurred partly because economics - the core of the
liberal philosophy - was hived off into highly specialised academic
discipline. Tragically, most intellectuals came to regard it as a grubby
science involving banknotes and factories that could safely be left to
lesser minds; they assumed that how the economy was organised had no bearing
on things that really mattered, such as culture and personal freedom. A good
recent example of this tendency would be Bertrand Russell, who despite his
intellectual breadth appeared to have little grasp of economics.
Human Action is an exercise in advocacy on a grand scale. It is an attempt
to convince the intelligent lay person that economics cannot be regarded as
a subject such as engineering, on which it is safe to have no opinion. Mises
sets himself the heroic task of demonstrating that the doctrines of market
economics in fact follow logically from a few simple assumptions about the
nature of all human action.
You need not assume a perverted love of money or greed, only that everybody
tries to remove feelings of uneasiness by exchanging one state of affairs
for another presumed to be better. Step by step, Mises attempts to show how
the form of social co-operation known as the market arises naturally from
unforced interactions between individuals and how and why most attempts to
interfere with this mechanism will cause more problems than they solve.
Mises's style is admittedly an acquired taste: he is as magisterial as his
near-contemporary (and fellow Austrian aristocrat) Ludwig Wittgenstein, who
at 29 claimed to have solved all the problems of philosophy. But, allowing
for this, Human Action remains a fascinating synthesis of economics,
philosophy and political science. It offers perhaps the clearest exposition
of the Austrian approach to market economics in existence: nearly all the
themes that later preoccupied Hayek, from the role of the market as a
discovery process to the case for denationalising money, are shrewdly
analysed. Having been proved right on socialism, Mises now deserves a
broader readership.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Monday Interview: Old man and the sea change - Harry
Oppenheimer, former chairman of the Anglo American/De Beers group, talks to
Andrew Gowers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enthusing about his family firm and its role in the new South Africa, the
small man with the bald head and quizzical eyes suddenly interrupts himself.
'I'm afraid I talk as though no one paid any attention to what I had to say
nowadays,' he says with a knowing twinkle. 'I'm out of this thing.'
Claims of this sort pepper a 90-minute conversation with Harry Oppenheimer,
84-year-old patriarch of the Anglo American/De Beers group and most
prominent voice of South African business for at least four decades. 'I'm
very old,' he says in his sing-song English gentleman's accent, after making
another apparently authoritative pronouncement about Anglo strategy. 'The
people who run this company may think differently.'
He knows, of course, that they do not. Oppenheimer may have formally retired
as chairman in 1982, but the men he left in control of South Africa's
largest conglomerate were all hand-picked by him and all regularly consult
him on company policy as the group's largest individual investor. Scarcely a
day goes by when he does not show up for work in Anglo's imposing
headquarters at 44 Main Street, Johannesburg; his office, though it carries
the name of the real family firm, E Oppenheimer &amp; Son, is just down the
corridor from that of the current chairman of Anglo and De Beers, Julian
Ogilvie Thompson.
These days, the company's managers may have greater reason than ever to
solicit the political and commercial wisdom of the man they call 'HFO'. For
South Africa is in the midst of a traumatic passage to majority rule, its
economic prospects are at best highly uncertain, and its future black rulers
have been making less than friendly noises about the white-owned mining,
manufacturing and financial conglomerates that exercise such an overwhelming
grip on its business life. Amid much talk of the need for such groups to
'unbundle' and of regulatory trust-busting under a new government, Anglo is
first in the firing line.
Oppenheimer, however - a long-standing critic of apartheid despite the
wealth he accumulated within the system - does not seem greatly perturbed.
Of course, he says, there is the risk that the transition could go badly
wrong, but against that must be weighed the greater risks of standing in the
way of change.
Like most of the country's elite, Oppenheimer assumes a constitutional
settlement will be reached and that South Africa will be ruled by a
government dominated by the ANC a year from now. What, then, of the
potential risks to his business? The ANC, after all, has no reason to favour
the conglomerates that prospered under apartheid, and it was not long ago
that its leaders talked of nationalising them.
Here the former Anglo chairman is philosophical, as befits someone who has
heard threats of nationalisation before - notably in 1948, when the National
party first came to power. Certainly the company 'shouldn't expect
gratitude' from the ANC for its role in criticising the old system, he
admits. Indeed, while he refuses to admit to any moral qualms about the past
 -'my temperament isn't like that' - he acknowledges the group could have
done more to advance black welfare. Too often, he says, 'we kept on saying
how wonderful we were to have made the effort . . . and then we didn't go on
pressing.'
But nor does he expect that white business will in the end be singled out
for punishment. 'Certainly I think this will be a government with which
business people can work comfortably. You know, we've had a great deal of
experience working with very, very difficult governments in Africa - a great
deal more difficult than this one is likely to be . . .
'I don't think there's any risk of a government dominated by the ANC
nationalising the mines or Anglo American. They had this as part of their
policy. But when they . . . went into the thing, and they talked to business
people around the world, I think they changed their mind.'
Perhaps so, but the threat has not entirely evaporated. In the ANC lexicon,
nationalisation has been replaced by talk of pursuing active anti-trust
policies to curb monopolies and reduce the domination of the economy by a
few large groups. Given that Anglo owns a Byzantine network of holdings in
precious metal and diamond mining, manufacturing and services companies that
account for more than a quarter of the value of shares quoted on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange, can it avoid early interference by the new
government?
Oppenheimer evidently thinks so. He is unmoved by recent talk of unbundling
conglomerates - encouraging them to dispose of some of their interests - and
by the restructuring announced recently by Anglo's rival, Gencor, widely
portrayed as the first step in a transformation of corporate South Africa.
'I neither believe nor disbelieve in unbundling,' he says. 'I think it's
absurd to say that a holding company just in principle should only invest in
one industry. On the other hand, from time to time you do get circumstances
where it's desirable for a group like ours to part with their interests in a
company . . . But personally I wouldn't dream of accepting a policy of
unbundling.'
Oppenheimer suspects that the real political argument concerns the power
wielded by blacks in the economy - or rather, the lack of it. And here he
acknowledges that the big business groups must play a pro-active role. 'I
think it's extremely dangerous to be ruled by people who have no material
stake in the country,' he says. 'And as you can't - even if you wanted to -
stop being ruled by the majority, we've got to see that people in that
majority have as large a share in the material assets of the country as we
can.'
Oppenheimer sees the need to facilitate the growth of black economic power.
'If I saw an opportunity for that and it involved unbundling something, I
would look at it very seriously . . . Of course, it's more difficult to do
than it was in the old days because largely they (the blacks) haven't the
capital to do it and very often they haven't the skills to do it. But still,
these things will grow, both the capital and the skills.'
He is confident any new government will hesitate to tamper radically with
South Africa's big business groups in case it chokes off the investment and
new jobs the economy badly needs. For Anglo, with 80 per cent of its assets
and income in South Africa, this is a potential trump card.
'If a great many obstacles were put in the way of our having a successful
and expanding business here - and I don't think you could have a very
successful business if it's not expanding - there would be pressure to do it
elsewhere,' says Oppenheimer. 'But at the moment, certainly all the pressure
is to invest in South Africa, not outside.'
Perhaps this amounts to making a virtue out of necessity. Anglo cannot
easily embark on a significant further internationalisation of its business
while it is trapped behind South Africa's rigorous regime of exchange
controls. Its most ambitious attempt to expand abroad - by trying to take
over London-based Consolidated Goldfields in the late 1980s - ended in
humiliating failure.
But even in this cloud he sees a silver lining: 'I always think we've been a
lucky company, and the luckiest thing that's happened to us for many years
was that that bid failed. I'm very sorry for the loss of prestige involved
in the failure, but it would never have worked. I don't think we could have
got on with the people involved. We would have had continual miseries, and I
think it's much better as we are.'
For better or worse, Anglo is thus condemned to seek survival in the new
South Africa. With his son Nicholas now running the Central Selling
Organisation diamond cartel in London, and serving as one of Anglo's deputy
chairmen, and grandson Jonathan preparing to join the group from Oxford
University, Oppenheimer hopes it will remain something of a family firm. But
there is no doubt where its fortunes will be determined. 'If the ship sinks,
I shall drown,' says the former chairman, 'but I'm not going to jump
overboard.'

FT  28 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Bank under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE German Bundesbank will find itself in the international firing line
again this week as its European partners pile on the pressure for lower
German interest rates ahead of its council meeting on Thursday, writes
Gillian Tett.
In spite of the continued inflationary pressures in Germany, there is
speculation that the forthcoming G-7 summit might prod the Bundesbank into
action.
But with the D-Mark continuing to soften against the dollar and European
currencies, the markets remain wary of predicting how fast or how far the
Bundesbank might move.
Following French calls for a concerted interest rate cut last week, the
markets will be watching the Bank of France closely to see whether it is
prepared to instigate any further independent rate cuts.
With French official rates now below German rates for the first time in 26
years, many economists doubt that France could implement rapid cuts in the
face of continuing Bundesbank intransigence.
Nevertheless, the deepening recession in France has led some observers to
interpret last week's statements by Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French finance
minister, as an indication that France might be willing to move ahead with
bold rate cuts.
'All this puts the focus on the extent to which the French really need the
Germans to cut their rates,' said Ms Alison Cottrell, international
economist with Midland Global Markets.
Following the slight weakening of the French franc late last week, there are
fears that any rapid move could trigger selling of the French currency.
The yen is expected to remain volatile in the run up to the Japanese general
election, in spite of bouncing back from some its earlier losses last week.
Continuing tension over Japan's huge trade surplus with the US is expected
to make the yen-dollar rate sensitive to speculative movements ahead of next
week's G7 summit in Tokyo.

FT  28 JUN 93 / International Bonds: First-half issue volume up by 31% to
Dollars 200bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROBOND market has seen a surge in activity this year, helped by the
combination of falling interest rates, the easing of tensions within the
European exchange rate mechanism, and the large borrowing requirements of
sovereign and corporate borrowers.
The volume of new issues reached Dollars 200.78bn in the first six months of
1993, an increase of 31 per cent on the previous first half, according to
figures supplied by Euromoney.
'Bonds have sold very well,' said Mr David Karat, of Salomon Brothers in
London. He added that one of the most interesting aspects this year has been
the market's 'resilience to very difficult external conditions, such as the
ERM shocks and political problems'.
According to the OECD's latest report of 'Financial Market Trends'*, which
covers the period January - April 1993, 'new issues of straight bonds rose
by 43 per cent to Dollars 139bn, and offerings of floating-rate notes more
than doubled in volume terms to Dollars 19bn.'
The report adds that equity-linked bonds 'also experienced a noticeable
rebound', with a total of Dollars 11bn issued in January-April.
'Even though redemptions of outstanding bonds have been exceptionally large
so far this year (around Dollars 100bn), the net volume of funds raised in
the bond markets was, at Dollars 70bn, some Dollars 30bn greater than in the
corresponding period of 1992,' the report says.
In terms of currency break-down, the US dollar remains the most important
currency for borrowers, with the volume of Eurodollar issuance up by 55 per
cent to Dollars 72.26bn.
However, aside from the dollar, the other main currencies have seen quite a
reshuffling in their rankings. New issues in D-Mark doubled (to the
equivalent of Dollars 30.2bn) with the result that the D-Mark has displaced
the Ecu from the number two position.
This reflects the reassessment of the European currencies which took place
in the wake of the first Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty in June
1992, when the Danes voted against European economic and monetary union.
The ensuing market turmoil meant that investors rushed into D-Mark assets,
while Ecu issuance ground to a virtual halt and, even with the second Danish
referendum result in May 1993 (this time in favour of the treaty), it
remains low, putting the Ecu in ninth place.
Sterling and the French franc have also moved ahead, to third and fourth
position respectively.
Eurosterling issuance jumped 81 per cent, reflecting more attractive swap
opportunities and healthy investor demand.
Meanwhile, the yen, which ranked third in the corresponding period last
year, saw a decline in new issuance, reflecting the recent bearish tone in
the Japanese government bond market.
Deutsche Bank held on to its position as the top Eurobond lead manager for
the first six months, while Goldman Sachs leapt up the table to take second
position.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Risk and Reward: Use of derivatives on the increase in
developing countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE USE of derivatives for risk management is becoming more wide-spread in
developing countries, according to a report by the International Finance
Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank.
Until now, many of the techniques open to companies functioning in developed
economies have been unavailable or unfamiliar to companies in developing
countries, which often have to cope with greater, and less predictable,
risks.
Typically, inflation is a far more serious risk in developing countries. In
practice, it forces firms to shorten their planning horizons, and reduces
the maturity range of financial instruments available.
Along with inflation risk comes greater currency risk. Companies may borrow
money in foreign currencies because they are attracted to the lower interest
rates, but a company raising funds in dollars at low interest rates could
face insuperable problems, if its currency exposure was not hedged and its
currency was subsequently de-valued.
Companies in developing countries are also likely to be more susceptible to
political risk - not only because a volatile political climate may affect
the attitudes of their counterparties, but also because more protectionist
governments may, for example, impose restrictions on foreign exchange.
The IFC has performed a dual role in helping such companies make use of
derivatives: first, in educating them about the techniques available and how
to use them, and second in acting as an intermediary with banks.
Many companies in developing countries are not considered sufficiently
creditworthy by banks to access the derivative markets in their own right.
Even if they can gain access, almost all are severely restricted in the
maturities available. Typically, companies may have access to derivatives
with a duration of 18 months, but, with IFC intermediation, this can be
extended to five or seven years, to match their needs.
Mr Rene Karsenti, treasurer of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, which has a similar programme, said many companies could, in
theory, access the swaps market by posting collateral against swaps, but
banks were not always prepared to do the necessary paperwork for small
transactions.
Since the IFC's first risk management project in June 1990, the board has
approved 19 projects enabling clients to hedge around Dollars 1.5bn of
liabilities, in countries ranging from Mexico and Bolivia to Ghana and
Egypt.
Mr Jack Glen, the IFC economist who wrote the report, says Brazil is the
most advanced of the developing countries in its use of derivatives, largely
because the government has allowed the financial sector to develop more
freely than in many other developing countries.
In Brazil, interest rate swaps have been allowed since last year, and
currency swaps have recently been authorised.
Other more sophisticated markets are Mexico, Chile and India, which have
hedging instruments available in their own domestic markets. In other
countries, firms are beginning to turn to markets in the major financial
centres. 'Lack of sophistication in the local financial markets has so far
translated into a lack of derivative securities for dealing with local
currency exchange risk and interest rate risk,' the report says.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development also advises its
clients - in this case eastern European companies - on risk management. The
Bank's loans to companies incorporate 'conversion options', allowing them,
at a fee, to change the currency of the loan. 'We discourage clients from
taking foreign exchange and commodity risk,' said Mr Karsenti.
For example, if a company exports to Germany, it may wish to pay interest
out of its cash flow in D-Marks, but if its profile changes, it can change
the currency of the interest payments accordingly.
The Bank can also offer loans which have interest payments linked to the
price of a commodity, which allows any company producing that commodity to
link its payments to expected earnings.

FT  28 JUN 93 / German Bunds: Balance tips in favour of rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO WILL the Bundesbank policy-making council cut interest rates when it
meets in Leipzig on Thursday? If so, what impact will it have on the bund
market?
After the markets were disappointed last week with a most minuscule snipping
of the rate, the balance may have been tipped in favour of a cut in the
German central bank's official rates on Thursday.
While the cut in the repo rate from 7.6 to 7.59 per cent was the first cut
at all since May 12, it could hardly have been more begrudging.
However, comments made by Mr Hans Tietmeyer on local radio yesterday were
more encouraging.
The vice-president of the central bank made clear that he had no wish to see
rates kept at unnecessarily high levels.
In a restatement of the central bank's long-term policy, he said that the
Bundesbank intended to bring rates down, but only in such a way that
long-term rates did not rise in response to easing at the short-end of the
yield curve.
As other members of the council have indicated recently, and as Mr Tietmeyer
reiterated, this can only happen if other parties to the policy-mix equation
pull the necessarily weight; if the political establishment is successful in
pushing though the much-vaunted public spending cuts, which are currently in
the final throes of negotiations; and if unions and employers agree to show
the necessary wage restraint.
Significantly, Mr Tietmeyer appeared to rule out the current weakness of the
D-Mark against other currencies within the European exchange rate mechanism,
the US dollar and the yen as an obstacle to further easing.
The weakness of the D-Mark ought to be interpreted as a 'normalisation', he
said, after a period in which foreign funds were pulled into the German
currency. These funds were now flowing back to their home currencies, a
natural development and not cause for concern.
Even before this statement, economists had become confident that the
Bundesbank would resume its process of gradual interest rate cuts before too
long.
'I think we will see another 25 basis points off the discount rate before
the end of July,' said Mr Thomas Mayer, an economist at Goldman Sachs, in
Frankfurt last Friday.
Such a move would cut the discount from 7.25 to 7 per cent.
Mr Mayer described the tiny cut in the repo rate last week as a 'loosening
up exercise' ahead of further easing.
However, any easing in repo and therefore money market rates cannot take
place without a reduction in the discount rate, which acts as a floor to the
Bundesbank's money market operations.
'The Bundesbank has a lot of balls in the air,' said Mr Robert Barrie,
economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London, 'and some of those balls will
have to be dropped - for example, the currency, which is overvalued.'
Mr Barrie believes that in the light of the problems in the German economy,
the Bundesbank has 'dragged its feet too long ' in making cuts.
The headline inflation figure - still more than 4 per cent - underestimates
the forces working against future inflation in Germany.
Money supply growth is also on the way down, Mr Barrie said, both factors
militating in favour of early rate cuts.
Opinions differ on the impact on the bund market. Mr Mayer at Goldman Sachs
believes the pattern of future easing has been anticipated to a large extent
and that long bond yields - while they may receive a fillip from a cut in
rates this week - are set to move up over the rest of the year.
He is predicting that long bund yields will be at 7.25 per cent in the early
part of next year, up from 6.7 per cent at present.
Mr Barrie is more sanguine. He forecasts that yields on the long bund will
be down to 6.35 per cent by the end of the year.
The best performance is likely to come at the short and medium end of the
yield curve where the impact of cuts in short-term official rates will be
most keenly felt.

FT  28 JUN 93 / US Money and Credit: Treasury prices advance as inflation
picture brightens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT 6.7 per cent, Treasury bond yields are once again close to their
historical lows, and three factors are driving prices up and interest rates
down.
First, the inflation picture has brightened since the dark days of early
1993, when prices were rising at a rate of around 4 per cent per year.
Recent data showed inflation slowing to nearer 3 per cent and all the latest
indicators point to an economic recovery that should remain sluggish and
relatively inflation-free.
Second, the Federal Reserve has put on an excellent show of
anti-inflationary fervour during the past two weeks. A series of
well-placed, if occasionally clumsy, leaks may have enraged traditionalists
at the Fed who prefer the central bank's policy positions to remain private,
but they sent a clear and unequivocal message to the financial markets: the
Fed stands ready to raise interest rates at the first hint of an upturn in
inflation.
Normally, the possibility of a Fed tightening would send bond yields sharply
higher - and it did, earlier this month.
But recently investors and dealers have come to take a more considered view
of the Fed's unusually public musings. Now, they are relieved that the
anti-inflation credibility of the Fed chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, has been
restored. After all, it was only a few weeks ago the market was worrying
that Mr Greenspan had become too familiar with the Clinton administration.
Third, President Clinton's economic package continues to make its way
through Congress and looks as if it will emerge with its central
deficit-reducing features more or less intact.
Admittedly, the bill only squeaked through the Senate on Thursday, thanks to
the clinching vote of vice-president Gore - hardly a ringing endorsement of
the President's economic policies.
The Clinton package is important not only because it is the first serious
attempt by the federal government to tackle its huge budget deficit.
The economic plan is also expected to act initially as a brake on economic
growth - something that even the Clinton administration admits is likely.
This is good news for bond investors.
Also, some analysts believe the package will ensure that interest rates
remain low. Mr Maury Harris, chief economist at Wall Street securities house
PaineWebber, is one of them.
He believes the Fed will hold off from using higher interest rates to slow
inflationary growth because tax rises and spending cuts will do the job for
them.
Mr Harris says: 'Considering the likelihood of a more restrictive fiscal
policy in the form of higher taxes and some spending restraint, maintaining
the 3 per cent Federal Funds rate probably will be the most sensible course
of action for the central bank at its August and September meetings.'
Moreover, 'if the tempo of reported economic activity and inflation picks up
a bit in June from the very modest May pace, it would not make sense this
year to try reigning in growth with higher interest rates when more taxes
and some federal spending restraint are just around the corner.'
Mr Harris need not worry, if the forecasts for this week's economic data are
to be believed. Economists are predicting the May leading indicators and
single-family home sales (both out tomorrow) will be flat or lower, that May
manufacturing orders (Wednesday) will be down 0.8 per cent, and that June
unemployment (Friday) will be 7.0 per cent, up from 6.9 per cent in May.
If the economic forecasts prove correct and the Clinton package stays on
schedule to be passed by Congress in August, then expect bond yields to come
down further over the next few weeks, setting new record lows in the
process.

FT  28 JUN 93 / UK Gilts: Yields fall on strong institutional buying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YIELDS continued to tumble on the back of strong buying by overseas and
domestic institutions as expectations improved about the UK inflation
outlook.
Several big institutions were reported to be switching out of French
government bonds into gilts, on the grounds that the UK securities look
relatively cheap.
Even with this Wednesday's biggest-ever gilt auction looming, the omens for
more gilt-yield reductions in the coming months look reasonably good. That
is assuming signs of price pressures in the economy remain thin on the
ground.
During the past week, many classes of gilts saw a yield reduction of about
10 basis points, with the moves being especially pronounced at the long end
of the gilt curve.
Comments at the end of the week by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that
he was unlikely to cut base rates in the near future cut the momentum of the
uptrend for short-dated securities.
While French 10-year government bonds have seen yields drop nearly 50 basis
points in the past month, gilts have almost matched this movement, with a
yield fall of about 35 basis points.
With 10-year gilt yields now about 7.7 per cent, compared with about 6.7 per
cent for comparable French bonds, many investors can be excused for
switching into the UK instruments.
The difference between 10-year gilt yields and the comparable figure for
German bonds has come down to about 1 percentage point from about 1.3
percentage points a month ago.
Indications last week that the pace of the UK recovery has become more muted
in recent months only added to the enthusiasm for gilt purchases, on the
basis that a weak upturn is less likely to spark inflation.
At the same time, there is little evidence that the UK is moving into a
second leg of recession. This would be bad for the gilt market, which wants
modest growth to erode the Pounds 50bn gap between government spending and
revenues.
The latest Confederation of British Industry survey of manufacturers, issued
on Friday, was music to the ears of gilts practitioners. It showed that,
after strong first-quarter growth, many companies have in the past two
months become less confident about increasing sales volumes.
The survey also indicated that inflationary pressures were subdued, with
only few companies thinking they will increase prices over the next few
months.
Mr Leslie Gunde, chief economist at engineering company GKN and a member of
the Treasury's industrial prospects committee, said: 'The recovery is going
to be slower than previous upturns, but it is definitely happening.'
Mr Ian Shepherdson, a bond specialist at brokers Greenwell Montagu, said the
gilt market was generally cheered by Mr Clarke's approach in his first month
as chancellor. 'He seems to be a growth man, but not so much that he's going
to be irresponsible (by cutting interest rates quickly and sparking
inflation)'.
A sign of the interest in gilts last week was that, out of a tranche of
Pounds 850m of bonds provided to the market by the Bank of England, the
long-dated securities sold out within hours.
While the market snapped up the Pounds 400m worth of 8 per cent stock
maturing in 2013, there were fewer buyers for Pounds 300m of five-year bonds
and Pounds 150m of long-dated index-linked securities.
Only on Friday did the market appear fully to wake up to the implications of
this week's gilt auction, when the Bank will be selling Pounds 3.25bn of 8
per cent bonds due in 2003.
The small subsequent rise in yields along the curve - except for securities
above the 15-year mark - was probably partly in anticipation of the
price-reducing effects of such a large stock coming on to the market.
Even with the effects of the Pounds 3bn or so a month of gilts likely to be
sold over the next year, Mr Steven Bell of Deutsche Bank believes 10-year
gilt yields will continue to fall to 7.3 per cent by next summer. He reckons
five-year yields will also come down over this period, from 7.05 per cent to
6.4 per cent.

FT  28 JUN 93 / International Company News: Stone plans to raise Dollars
386m in note issues

<TEXT>
STONE Container, the Chicago-based international packaging and paper group,
is raising USDollars 386m with two note issues and considering spinning off
its newsprint and groundwood papers operations through a public equity
issue.
Stone bought its Canadian, British and German newsprint and packaging
operations in 1989 for CDollars 2.6bn (USDollars 2bn). It detached the
profitable Europa Carton business in Germany, making it a direct subsidiary
of Stone Container, Chicago.
The newsprint mills in eastern Canada, Arizona and Ellesmere Port, near
Liverpool, were soon battered by the global recession.
Stone has about USDollars 4bn debt and is raising USDollars 250m by the
private placement of notes yielding 9 per cent and convertible into common
stock at USDollars 11.15 a share
It is also raising about USDollars 150m with a five-year note at 12.625 per
cent interest. The net proceeds of the issues will be about USDollars 386m.
The company confirmed it was pursuing a spin-off of its newsprint interests
into a new public company as 'an attractive option'.
The newsprint unit would include the Canadian, US and UK mills. A share
issue would raise about USDollars 250m in new equity. The unit would have
annual sales of around USDollars 1bn with annual capacity of 1.7m tonnes of
newsprint and groundwood papers.
Mr Stanley Ho, the Hong Kong hotel magnate, plans to buy Toronto's luxury
Sutton Place Kempinski from a group of German investors for a reported price
below CDollars 40m, or less than half book value.
The hotel has been in receivership since December. Mr Ho bought a similar
luxury hotel in Vancouver in 1988 and contracted management to Meridien, the
Air France subsidiary. He is also a shareholder in Meridien.
He has also contracted management of Sutton Place to Meridien.

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PUMA, the troubled German-based sports goods manufacturer, is to close the
last factory on its home soil by the end of August.
More than 200 jobs will go as a result of the closure of a football boot
works at Herzogenaurach, Bavaria, leaving just 470 working for the company
in Germany, mainly in design, marketing and administration.
The move, announced by Mr Jochen Zeitz, chairman, will be followed next
month by the unveiling of a reorganisation plan which will set Puma on the
way to becoming 'a new, fast, lean, flexible and effective business,' he
said.
'It is simply no longer justifiable to maintain a factory which loses money
year after year,' Mr Zeitz added.
The plant's output of 200,000 pairs of boots a year, representing 3 per cent
of total production will be transferred to low-cost manufacturers, including
Butana, a Czech licence-holder.
Mr Zeitz, 30, is the third new chairman to be appointed since Puma was taken
over by the Swedish Aritmos group in 1990. Puma made a provisional loss last
year of around DM12m (Dollars 7m) on sales of more than DM500m.

FT  28 JUN 93 / International Company News: Japan may reconsider derivatives
regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE financial authorities may reconsider controversial regulations
limiting trading in derivatives which have angered foreign stockbrokers in
Tokyo specialising in the instruments.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to call on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to
follow principles agreed with the US in talks on Friday when the exchange
revises regulations governing stock index futures trading.
The ministry has softened its position after sustained foreign criticism
that it was re-regulating the stock market.
US officials regard the agreement as a small but significant further step in
unwinding Japanese financial regulations, after Tokyo offered concessions on
its tightly regulated pensions market last week.
The Japanese authorities said they would abolish the distinction between old
and new pension funds, which has disadvantaged foreign fund managers.
Foreign fund managers are only allowed to manage new money, collected after
the pension insurance law was revised in 1990 to allow foreign fund managers
into the market. This prevents foreign investment advisers from bidding for
the bulk of existing pension funds.
The ministry will also lower the minimum amount of assets which a fund
manager can receive to Y100m (Dollars 940,000), from Y500m for foreign
companies and Y1bn for Japanese companies, which may make it easier for
foreign companies to enter the market.
Last August, the ministry told the Tokyo Stock Exchange to consider
regulations on futures trading, which it said had helped to destabilise the
Tokyo stock market. However, on Friday the ministry agreed regulations
should be non-discriminatory and predictable.
Mr Lawrence Summers, the US Treasury under-secretary for international
affairs, said before the talks on Friday that regulations should be
introduced only for prudential reasons rather than to try to stabilise the
price of the stock market.

second-quarter setback

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Hershey Foods, best known for its chocolate and confectionery
products, fell Dollars 1 3/4 on Friday to Dollars 47 3/4 , after the
Pennsylvania-based company warned that second- quarter earnings would not
match last time's 39 cents a share.
Hershey pointed out that the earnings figure for the second quarter of 1992
had included a five cents a share gain from the sale of a business in
Brazil.
The 1992 second quarter had also been particularly strong in terms of sales
volume.
Mr Richard Zimmerman, Hershey's chairman, added that the group's core
Hershey Chocolate USA division achieved unit volume growth of 12 per cent in
the first quarter of the current year.
'These higher than expected first-quarter sales may be affecting the timing
of second-quarter sales,' he said.
Mr Zimmerman admitted that the expected results were 'disappointing', but
noted that initial sales orders for the third and fourth quarters -
seasonally much larger - appeared to be good.
'We currently expect 1993 to be another record year for Hershey Foods,' he
said.
Hershey estimated that, after adjusting for the one-off gain in the 1992
earnings per share figure, the comparable 1993 result could be between five
and 10 cents lower.
Hershey saw an earnings per share figure of Dollars 2.69 in its last full
year, to end-December, and reported earnings per share (excluding
accounting-related charges and another one-off asset sale gain) of 71 cents
in the first quarter of 1993, up from 65 cents a year earlier.
Data General, the US computer group, said preliminary indications were that
revenues and financial results for its third quarter, ending June 26, would
be lower than analysts' expectations, AP-DJ reports.
The company blamed weaker than expected order rates from the European
marketplace.
Nine analysts have estimated that Data General will post a loss of 13 cents
a share for the third quarter. Estimates ranged from break-even to a loss of
21 cents.
For the third quarter last year Data General posted a loss of Dollars 11.7m,
or 35 cents a share.

STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, is reviewing debt ratings of
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, a leading Japanese commercial bank, for a possible
downgrade.
S&amp;P said it had placed its AA - rating on DKB's long-term debt and A-1+
rating on its short-term debt on a 'creditwatch with negative implications'
due to the bank's substantial level of non-performing loans.
DKB's non-performing loans totalled Y1,300bn (Dollars 12.3bn) at the end of
March this year, comprising 3.8 per cent of total loans.
S&amp;P said while non-performing loans at all Japanese banks were expected to
rise during last fiscal year to March 1993, the increase at DKB was greater
than expected.
The credit agency will evaluate the extent of DKB's asset deterioration and
assess the impact on the bank's operating profits over the medium term.

FT  28 JUN 93 / International Company News: Orcofi aims to broaden its base
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ORCOFI, the French invest-ment company launched three years ago to form a
luxury goods group, plans to concentrate on investments outside the luxury
sector in an attempt to broaden the base of its business.
Mr Henry Racamier, the veteran French businessman who founded Orcofi after
his defeat in the bitter battle for control of the LVMH luxury goods group,
said in an interview with Le Figaro newspaper that the company could not
find any more suitable investments in the luxury sphere and was considering
new areas of activity such as food and pharmaceuticals.
The change in Orcofi's strategy comes at a turbulent time for the global
luxury goods industry, which has been badly affected by the recession.
LVMH recently warned of a fall in profits for the first half of 1993.
Richemont, the South African group behind Dunhill, this week announced it
was restructuring its luxury interests.
Orcofi, which has stakes in the Ines de la Fressange fashion house and Daum
crystal, has come under financial pressure.
It made a net loss of FFr112.5m (Dollars 19.6m) in 1992 on turnover of
FFr635m. Lanvin, the French fashion house that it owns jointly with the
L'Oreal cosmetics group, recently reshuffled its senior management following
an expensive relaunch last autumn.
Mr Racamier announced this spring that he was retiring as executive chairman
of Orcofi to be replaced by Mr Pierre Schmidt, chief executive.
Mr Schmidt will orchestrate the company's diversification using its
remaining investment funds of FFr3bn.
He also plans to seek a stock market quotation so that some of the founding
shareholders can realise their holdings.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CHINESE trading corp-oration and China's leading underwriter are to launch
China's first US dollar domestic bond issue since the 1949 revolution.
The National Metallurgical Import and Export Corporation is offering Dollars
40m in bonds with one and two-year maturities at interest rates of 4.1 per
cent and 4.6 per cent. The government-backed underwriter, China Securities
Co, will help distribute the issue. Bonds will be tradeable through China's
newly-established national electronic trading system.
Mr Bai Baohua, general manager of NMIEC, said the funds would be used for
raw materials imports and advanced technology for iron and steel
enterprises. China is upgrading its iron and steel sector and aims to be
producing 100m tonnes of steel by the year 2000, against the present 80m
tonnes.
Chinese organisations are also anxious to tap local foreign currency
deposits. Chinese residents have salted away some Dollars 10bn in foreign
currencies.
China, meanwhile, has been struggling to sell yuan-denominated treasury
bills, and has been obliged to extend the period for their sale at least
twice. At the end of May only 28 per cent of a yuan 30bn (Dollars 7.7bn)
issue had been sold.
Provincial governments have been urged to re-double efforts to sell treasury
bills. Institutional and private interest in the paper has slumped, partly
because interest rates have fallen below inflation.

to a group of US investors as part of its debt reduction programme. It has
sold NZDollars 2.2bn (USDollars 1.2bn) worth of assets since last June.
The investors included several that helped form a similar joint venture last
year to buy a major shareholding in Fletcher's forests in in New Zealand.

FT  28 JUN 93 / International Company News: Hambros hired to value Il Giorno

HAMBROS, the UK merchant bank with considerable experience in privatisation
business, has joined the growing list of City of London institutions winning
mandates in Italy's privatisation programme.
Hambros has been hired by the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group to
value Il Giorno, Eni's Milan-based daily newspaper and Nuova Same, the
paper's typesetting and printing affiliate.
Il Giorno used to be one of Milan's most famous papers, with sales of more
than 200,000. Circulation has fallen and the paper's image has been
tarnished by labour disputes and controversy about editorial policy because
of Eni's ownership. However, average sales last year were 170,596 a day.
Eni, which hopes to float part of its Agip oil business this year, has been
pursuing a piecemeal privatisation strategy for many of its other
activities, based on the view that the recession has reduced the uptake for
individual large disposals.

EXCEPTIONAL costs hit United Industries in the year ended April 3 leaving
pre-tax losses ahead from Pounds 1.54m to Pounds 3.63m.
The materials handling, springs and process machinery group saw turnover
fall from Pounds 32.3m to Pounds 29.6m, with the discontinued cutting tool
operations accounting for Pounds 2.35m (Pounds 3.94m). The operating deficit
was Pounds 556,000 (Pounds 79,000) shared by continuing businesses Pounds
295,000 (profit Pounds 191,000) and discontinued Pounds 261,000 (Pounds
270,000).
In the exceptional charges were Pounds 474,000 for reorganising the Dutch
spring company, Pounds 447,000 for redundancy and reorganisation, and Pounds
1.35m loss on sale of cutting tool div-ision.
The economies in which the group operated worsened during the second half.
In particular the Dutch operations which benefited from the strong German
market and had been relatively little affected by recession, suffered a
sudden and substantial downturn in orders.

<TEXT>
The salary of Lord Young, executive chairman of Cable and Wireless, the
telecommunications group, has risen from Pounds 487,375 to Pounds 863,410,
an increase of 77 per cent.
C&amp;W's annual report shows that the former cabinet minister received a
performance-related bonus of Pounds 409,828 for the year to March 31, during
which the group's pre-tax profits increased by 43 per cent, from Pounds 644m
to Pounds 918m under FRS 3.
The report said that the substantial bonuses paid to directors in the past
year reflected the group's considerable progress, not just only in 1992-93,
but also in previous years. There was a considerable long-term element to
the bonus scheme, and no bonuses had been paid in 1991-92.

FT  28 JUN 93 / International Company News: Crucial meeting on Ronson
refinancing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS OF Heron International, Mr Gerald Ronson's property group, start a
series of meetings today to decide whether to support proposals for
refinancing the group's Pounds 1.4bn debt.
Today's meeting, to be held in London, is the most crucial and likely to set
the tone for meetings in the Netherlands on June 30 and Curacao on July 5.
While Heron's advisers say that early indications are favourable to the
company, the outturn is by no means simple to predict.
The meeting could be lively, since many creditors are expected to voice
concerns about the amount and appropriateness of information provided in the
proposal documents.
One creditor, First Eastern Developments, a property consulting company owed
Dollars 1.7m by Heron, has gathered views from a number of others, including
many bondholders. Mr Simon Shane, head of FED, said many creditors who
responded to a questionnaire FED sent out said there was insufficient
information to form a view on the proposals.
He said 'unless you know what debt is secured against what assets in what
company you can't form a view if a bank has a secondary recourse elsewhere.'
Mr Shane plans to seek a legal review of the information offered even if the
proposals are approved. He fears Heron could set the standards for future
restructurings.
There may also be questions about the continuing role of Mr Ronson at the
group, on a salary of Pounds 500,000 a year which some regard as excessive.
Also there are concerns that he is leading an investor group which is buying
some assets from Heron.
Under the proposals, bondholders would swap Pounds 100 of bonds for Pounds
29.80 worth of senior debt and Pounds 7.28 of junior debt, which will both
take the form of new bonds, and 6.7949 new shares in Heron.
Voting is complex. At today's meeting approval of the proposals requires a
75 per cent majority by value of the votes cast, either in person or by
proxy, and a 50 per cent majority by number of votes. This means that a bank
holding proxies for a large number of bondholders could sway the numerical
vote by putting each proxy in individually rather than as a block.
Mr Ronson will chair the meeting and start with a brief introduction,
followed by an update of the trading position. He will point to more than
Pounds 140m of property disposals already agreed, ahead of schedule and at
prices above the value assumed in the plan.
This is important since the restructuring proposals assume some improvement
in the property market merely to meet repayments of the senior debt.
Heron has repeatedly said that if the proposals are rejected the group will
face insolvency, an outcome which it says would deliver significantly less
to creditors.

FT  28 JUN 93 / International Company News: All the nasties cleared from the
books - Whitecroft's plea to institutions for one last chance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mike Derbyshire and Martyn Ellis will be in Glasgow today meeting Scottish
Amicable, the last of Whitecroft's four main institutional shareholders.
They will be explaining why they should be allowed one more chance after
announcing pre-tax losses of Pounds 41.8m.
Their message is simple: Whitecroft has gone back to manufacturing and is
promising never to dabble in property again; it has reduced itself to a more
manageable size and array of businesses and factories; it is in its markets
of yore, where it knows what it is doing and can influence events; and there
are no more nasties lurking in the books from the follies of the 1980s.
The losses for the year to end March, announced last Tuesday, were a shock,
Even the restatement of the previous year's figures under FRS 3 showed them
as a Pounds 3.65m loss, not the Pounds 4.5m profit on which Whitecroft paid
a 4p dividend. Shareholders funds were down from Pounds 46m to Pounds 24m
and borrowings were Pounds 35m.
Derbyshire and Ellis immediately got to work with presentations to
shareholders and analysts in the City, briefed managers at their
headquarters on Thursday and returned to London for more briefings on
Friday.
Together with Scottish Amicable, Mercury Asset Management, M&amp;G and BZW
Investment Management own more than half the shares.
The tactics seem to be working. The share price ended the week only 2p down
at 47p, and only 3p below the year's high.
The company had lost the confidence of many investors because of a series of
profits and dividend warnings as it was squeezed between a rise in gearing
and falling property values from the latter half of 1989. The worst never
appeared to be over, even though management kept giving the appearance it
had
In the end investors had to be appeased by bloodletting. In March, Peter
Goold, 24 years in the company and chairman since 1989, and Graham
M'Cardell, the finance director, fell on their swords.
David Kendall, head of Bunzl, came in as part-time non-executive chairman.
Derbyshire, who joined Whitecroft from Norcros last year as Goold's deputy,
moved to chief executive. Ellis came as finance director from Inchcape,
where he had learned from such luminaries as the late Sir George Turnbull.
Whitecroft's shares - tipped in January by Henry Cooke Lumsden, the
Manchester stockbroker, as one of the recovery shares of the year - started
to move up.
So how did Whitecroft get into this mess? It was hardly a newcomer to the
market. It floated in 1900, having emerged from a trade association of dyers
and bleachers in Whalley Bridge.
With maturity came dullness. By the early 1980s, Whitecroft was an
unglamorous little manufacturing stock rooted in basic industries, such as
commercial lighting, builders' merchants and industrial or specialist
textiles.
Things started stirring between 1984 and 1987 with Tom Weatherby, who had
emerged from one of its textile companies as chairman. The property and
building boom was under way and Whitecroft, already in some of those
markets, joined the bandwagon.
The company prospered. A rights issue in 1987 gave it Pounds 15m to go
hunting. The next year, the sale of its low-yielding chain of builders'
merchants brought in Pounds 34m.
After failing to buy Eleco Holdings, the construction and building products
group, Whitecroft paid Pounds 6m cash for Lightning Windows, maker of PVC
and aluminium replacements windows and doors.
Trent Holdings, manufacturer of specialist doors and fittings, was bought
for Pounds 13m, followed by MB Modern Decor, which made PVC and aluminium
replacement doors and windows, at Pounds 5m; then 80 per cent of a
Netherlands fabrics and trimmings company for Pounds 4.4m; then Finch
Conservatories - with its successful brand image - at Pounds 6.2m.
Annual profits climbed 33 per cent, then 27 per cent; dividends rose to 15p
and the share price broke through 300p. But borrowings were rising and book
values were being inflated, sowing the seeds of disaster when the market
turned. Since the second half of 1989, it has been downhill
Whitecroft thought it would be safe because its property exploits had mainly
been in small office and retail developments. It was also into
housebuilding, but only in the north, where prices remained stable.
Last week's results showed just how hopelessly optimistic this was. In spite
of several earlier write-downs of property values, Hillier Parker  - the
valuers brought in to take a fresh look - slashed another Pounds 11m off
book values of Pounds 25m. That, combined with the Pounds 29m cost of
pulling out of the home improvements side, accounted for the rise in losses.
'We are now back to basics,' Derbyshire said yesterday. 'Industrial,
commercial and street lighting; building products; medical cotton fibre; and
specialised textiles.
All operating divisions are trading profitably and he says the remaining
properties are beginning to move now that they are realistically priced.
Last week, Derbyshire insists, was the rock bottom. He knows that Whitecroft
has almost run out of chances.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Taxable profifs of Caldwell Investments, the USM-quoted investment and
commercial holding company, rose from Pounds 32,000 to Pounds 176,000 in the
six months to April 30.
Turnover advanced from Pounds 1.96m to Pounds 2.96m. The directors said
sales volumes had improved and although there had been price pressure from
customers Caldwell had compensated for this by sourcing raw materials more
effectively.
Earnings improved from 0.3p to 1.48p and dividends are resumed with an
interim of 0.3875p. The company intends to recommend payment of a final
should profitability in the second half meet expectations.

FT  28 JUN 93 / New bond offerings reach record high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW bond offerings reached a record and helped to boost the volume of
borrowing in the international capital markets by 38 per cent to Dollars
256.3bn (Pounds 170bn) in the period January-April 1993, according to the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development*.
'The acceleration in borrowing activity was entirely due to a record volume
of bond offerings, which accounted for two thirds of the total, and a
significant advance in programmes for the issuance of euro-commercial paper
and medium-term euro-notes' said the OECD report.
A total of Dollars 170.3bn was raised in bond issues in the period
January-April this year, out of a total of Dollars 256.3bn and against
Dollars 114.2bn in bond issuance in the comparable period in 1992.
More recent figures supplied by Euromoney show eurobond issues in the first
six months of 1993 amounted to Dollars 200.78bn, against Dollars 152.87bn in
the first half of 1992.
The OECD predicts that the high level of activity in the international bond
market will continue, even if the growth in securities business is 'less
spectacular'.
In addition, the organisation expects to see more non-OECD borrowers (for
example those from Latin America) stepping up the flow of offerings,
especially as they approach investment grade ratings.

<TEXT>
THE London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe) and
the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) have abandoned plans to form a trading and
clearing link.
The exchanges decided to suspend discussions, which began last October,
because Liffe was not satisfied that the terms of the linkage would bring
greater volume to the exchange.
The CBOT had proposed to share its growing 10-year Treasury note futures
contract with the London exchange, in return for the right to trade Liffe's
German and Italian government bond contracts.
'There was some concern that there might be some loss of liquidity at Liffe
because of the overlap (in trading hours),' said Mr Daniel Hodson, Liffe's
chief executive. The terms under discussion were that the bund future would
be traded on the CBOT from 1.15pm London time. Currently, the bund future
can be traded in London, either on the exchange floor or on Liffe's APT
after-hours trading system, until 6pm London time.
There also seems to have been a feeling that the CBOT's T-note contract,
less actively traded than its jealously-guarded long-bond contract, was not
a fair exchange for Liffe's top contracts.
Officials at both exchanges described the end of talks as amicable and said
that a potential linkage may be discussed again at some point.
'Fungible links are merely one of many ways in which exchanges can improve
their distribution,' said Mr Hodson, adding that Liffe may in the future
consider extending trading hours or expanding the use of its after-hours
trading system.
The suspension of the talks may simplify negotiations between Liffe and
Globex, the 24-hour trading system owned by the CBOT, the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange and Reuters.
Globex has been in talks with the London exchange for more than four years,
but Liffe's interest has dulled due to the disappointing volume generated by
the system since its launch last year. Even the CBOT chairman, Mr Pat Arbor,
was sceptical about the prospects of Liffe joining Globex. 'I think they are
very happy with their own (after hours trading) system,' Mr Arbor said.

FT  28 JUN 93 / BP on target after a year of painful cuts / A look at a
reversal in fortunes at the oil group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID SIMON can look back this weekend on a year in the top post at
British Petroleum confident in the knowledge he has gone some way towards
reversing the fortunes of one of the UK's largest companies.
Last week's sale of another big chunk of the company's nutrition business
and its Swedish petrol stations means he has already achieved his target of
selling Dollars 2bn-worth (Pounds 1.3bn) of assets this year in an effort to
cut debt.
The stock market has welcomed Mr Simon's attempts to wrestle with BP's large
debt burden and, in spite of a flat oil price, the shares have risen by
two-thirds to pass 300p from a low of 180p last August.
That low point in BP's stock price followed the departure of Mr Robert
Horton, former chairman and chief executive, in a boardroom coup a year ago
and the subsequent dividend cut.
Mr Simon inherited a company strapped for cash with a debt-to-equity ratio
that had risen to almost 100 per cent by the end of last year.
As a result, he was forced to adopt a stringent cost-cutting programme
aiming to slice Dollars 1bn off operating costs by the end of this year,
including cutting 10 per cent of the workforce.
He also set some ambitious targets for disposals to cut debt and plans to
sell another Dollars 2bn of assets next year.
He set a goal of paying off BP's Dollars 14.5bn net debt at a rate of
Dollars 1bn a year.
It was either that or sacrifice all growth in the company for many years.
BP now looks like being able to deliver on most of its targets for the next
couple of years. Some 6,000 jobs have gone.
He has managed to arrest the company's cash haemorrhage by halving the net
outflow last year to Pounds 607m from Pounds 1.14bn the year before, with
surplus cashflow of Pounds 600m generated in the first quarter. Analysts
expect BP's profit to grow to around Pounds 900m next year, and Pounds 1.4bn
the year after. The company will begin next year to see a reduction in the
amount paid in North Sea oil taxes, which could add as much as Pounds 200m
to net profit.
But some in the City ask whether the company is running the risk of missing
investment opportunities because of its strict cost-cutting programme.
'BP can't go on tightening its belt forever. It needs some economic growth
in the business areas it serves and at some point a re-capitalisation of its
balance sheet,' said Mr Peter Spring, industry analyst at Henderson
Crosthwaite, the UK brokers.
Lord Ashburton, the company's chairman, has knocked on the head, for the
time being, the oft-repeated rumour of a rights issue but many in the City
believe the company will have to come to market eventually.
It desperately needs exposure to the fast-growing refining market in
south-east Asia where Shell, for example, is seeing high returns.
Nevertheless, the City's sceptics welcomed the company's sale of its US
animal feeds business, Purina Mills, and its Swedish petrol stations last
week which added Dollars 585m to its receipts from disposals so far this
year.
'One area in which the company has consistently outperformed every
expectation is the speed and price of its disposals amid indifferent
conditions,' said Mr Nick Antill, industry analyst at stockbrokers, Hoare
Govett. He also points out that, working on the basis that the most
attractive assets sell first, next year's disposals target could be a lot
more difficult to achieve.
The remaining small businesses in BP Nutrition should fetch a price of
around Dollars 500m and BP Chemicals is looking to sell parts of its
operations for around Dollars 600m over the next couple of years.
In addition, BP is looking to sell two oil refineries in the US - Marcus
Hook in Pennsylvania and Ferndale in Washington state - but few buyers are
interested in moving into a crowded US refining market. BP is left with the
dilemma of whether to implement the upgrade needed to bring the plants in
line with US environmental legislation at an estimated cost of Dollars 100m
each or to close them and take a write-off.
But if there are no takers for these parts of the business, the company
could be forced to sell assets previously considered its core activities,
such as some European petrol stations, which in turn will reduce its
exposure to the economic upturn.
If the company can rely upon cost-cutting and asset disposals to improve
earnings over the next couple of years, additional growth should start to
trickle in by 1995 from new oil exploration fields.
BP's high-risk exploration strategy of focusing on so-called 'frontier'
areas is beginning to pay off, although its hopes for Azerbaijan could be
jeopardised by local political unrest.
The company needs to diversify its sources of crude production: it is
heavily concentrated in the North Sea and Alaska, both of which should start
to decline by the end of the decade. The company's reserves-to-production
ratio - the length of time it can keep up production at its current rate
before it runs out of oil - is nine years compared with 16 years at Royal
Dutch/Shell. It was partly an expensive exploration programme in the past
that ran up debt.
BP's giant Cusiana field in Colombia is planned to come on stream in 1995,
adding Pounds 100m to profits by the end of the decade, with other
discoveries such as the Mars field in the Gulf of Mexico kicking in later.
The company's oil finds in UK waters west of the Shetland Isles could
provide an important new resource base for BP in the next century.
At the same time, the company could get a boost from an upturn in the
economic cycle which would help its downstream and chemicals businesses.
US investors, who have led the recovery in BP's shares, are more sanguine
about the company's future than many in the City. 'On a cashflow basis, the
company looks stronger and compared with a lot of US oil companies it is
trading at a reasonable price,' said Mr Lars Reierson, industry analyst at
Morgan Stanley in New York.
Mr Simon's target of earning Dollars 2bn net income by 1995 is within reach.
But many in the City believe this is a very modest aim, representing only a
10 per cent return on capital. BP will have to show it can use this as a
base for future growth.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Economics Notebook: Maastricht casts its shadow across
Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOVE it or loath it, the Maastricht Treaty just will not go away. It may
have slipped out of UK headlines in recent weeks. But it is just about to
cast its shadow across Germany.
The question as to whether or not the treaty conforms with Germany's
constitution will be the subject of a hearing on Thursday and Friday this
week before the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe.
Although it will probably be some months before the court comes to a
conclusion and makes its judgment public, Germany's policy-making
establishment is bracing itself for a thorough-going inquisition. Questions
sent by the court in advance to the Bonn government, the Bundesbank and
other relevant parties such as the commission in Brussels make clear that
doubts about the constitutionality of the Maastricht Treaty are
considerable.
The court's questions have not been published. But copies seen by the
Financial Times suggest that the authorities will have a hard time answering
them.
Senior German monetary officials involved in the case admit that it is
'serious'. Earlier this month, at a conference in Rome, Mr Horst Schulmann,
the president of the state central bank of Hesse and a member of the
Bundesbank council, said he expected the court would 'have some admonitions
in store'.
The court itself has maintained a trappist silence ahead of the hearings.
But Mr Schulmann let slip that an imbalance 'between progress in economic
and monetary integration and progress in the making of political union in
Europe' was at the heart of the Germany's problem over Maastricht.
In negotiating the treaty, Germany insisted that it would only give up the
D-Mark and the Bundesbank for a single European currency and central bank if
it could be sure that these would be just as effective in combating
inflation as existing arrangements.
It also sought a political union on the grounds that a transfer of
sovereignty over monetary and economic policy to a European System of
Central Banks (ESCB) would only be acceptable if matched by a commensurate
increase in democratic accountability at the community level.
While the Bonn government and Bundesbank initially prided themselves that
the plans for Emu safeguarded Germany against inflationary perils, the
court's questions cast doubt on this.
In particular, the court asks whether the Maastricht convergence criteria,
which are designed to prevent unsuitable candidates from joining Emu, can be
diluted and whether Germany could be obliged to enter stage three of Emu,
with its single currency and central bank, against its will.
A close reading of the Maastricht Treaty suggests that the answer to both of
these questions would be 'yes'.
Weightier still are the questions addressing the compatibility of Maastricht
with Germany's Basic Law or constitution.
The court wants to know how far Article 20 of the Basic Law, which says that
'all state power is rooted in the people', can be squared with a treaty that
transfers the part of this power dealing with economic and monetary policy
to European authorities of limited democratic accountability.
For many Germans, Article 20 has an almost mystical significance as a
bulwark against the return of any form of totalitarian government to their
country. When the court asks whether Germany might not lose part of its
'autonomy as a democratic state based on the rule of law' and its
'constitutional identity' through the Maastricht Treaty, its questions have
to be taken seriously.
A look at the questions suggests that the court has become increasingly
concerned about the treaty's impact. A first batch sent out by the court
focused largely on nitty gritty issues. A second batch was couched in far
broader terms to get to the heart of constitutional problems thrown up by
Maastricht.
That this is so probably owes much to the efforts of Mr Lothar Muller, the
president of the Bavarian central bank and a member of the Bundesbank
council. Over the past 18 months, he has waged a lonely campaign to bring
Germans face to face with the constitutional as well as the economic and
monetary implications of the treaty.
Mr Muller prides himself on being a 'good European' and has been scrupulous
to avoid giving any impression of opposition to European integration. But he
has, in a series of lectures and articles in newspapers and learned
journals, managed to bring into public view virtually all the of the
questions that will now pre-occupy the constitutional court.
His most recent article argued that while the German parliament has the
power to change the constitution, it cannot take fundamental decisions about
sovereignty and the nature of the state. Only the German people can do that.
Mr Muller insisted that the Maastricht Treaty, through its plans to create
an economic and monetary union, would lead to fundamental change in the
German state. The renunciation of monetary sovereignty represented a
transfer of sovereign rights affecting the foundations of Germany's
constitutional structure, he said.
The loss of monetary sovereignty through Emu could mean that the German
government and Bundesbank would be unable to achieve their statutory goal of
a 'well balanced economy'.
Mr Muller is especially concerned that Germany would not be in a position to
resist the projected move to the third stage of Emu with its single currency
and central bank on January 1 1999 if it so wanted. While the German
government has suggested that the planned 1996 intergovernmental conference
on political union would give an opportunity to iron out such doubts, the
questions put to Bonn by the constitutional court show that it not convinced
that Germany has the power to back out of Emu.
It is impossible to guess how the court will finally view Maastricht. But it
would be a delicious irony if Britain ratifies Maastricht and the treaty
finally founders on objections raised in a country that was one of the main
authors of the drive to Emu.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Foreign banks join Ferruzzi creditor committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPRESENTATIVES of Societe Generale of France and Union Bank of Switzerland,
believed to be two of the biggest foreign bank creditors to Italy's
deeply-troubled Ferruzzi group, have joined the five-member committee of
Italian creditor banks now guiding the group.
A UBS official noted the two foreign banks, also representing the 110-odd
foreign institutions which lent around L6,500bn (Pounds 2.8bn) to Ferruzzi,
were not strictly speaking members of the five-bank committee.
Rather, they had an 'advisory mandate' towards the five Italian creditor
banks and Ferruzzi itself.
Participating in the committee's activities 'doesn't imply anything about
the two banks' own exposures', the official claimed.
The official declined to give any indication of how much UBS had lent, as
such disclosures were forbidden under Swiss law.
Last week, Credit Lyonnais, the big French bank, indicated its exposure was
somewhat less than L300bn.
Shareholders gear up for the annual general meetings of Ferruzzi Finanziaria
(Ferfin), the holding company and its Montedison industrial arm.
Montedison shareholders will gather today at its Milan headquarters for the
first of this week's meetings.
The annual meeting, traditionally an endurance test because of frequent
interventions by environmentalists opposed to the company's chemicals
activities, promises to be an even greater challenge this year.
On Wednesday, the focus will shift to the sleepy town of Ravenna, where
Ferfin is based. Its annual meeting promises to be a particularly memorable
event.
The two meetings will give minority shareholders the first chance to air
their views on the fate of Ferruzzi after the five-bank committee stepped in
at the Ferruzzi family's request earlier this month.
The meetings, which will approve new boards greatly influenced by the banks,
will also give small shareholders their first chance to see Mr Guido Rossi,
the new bank-appointed chairman of Ferfin and Montedison, and Mr Enrico
Bondi, new managing director of Ferfin and Montedison.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Tietmeyer plays down weak D-Mark and hints at rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK sees the current weakness of the D-Mark as part of a
'normalisation' process and not the start of a run on the currency, Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, its vice-president, said yesterday.
In a radio interview, he also reiterated the commitment of the German
central bank to bringing down interest rates when conditions are appropriate
 -a statement which, in conjunction with his apparent nonchalance about the
currency, may stimulate hopes of further early cuts in interest rates. Some
economists believe these could come as early as Thursday, when the
Bundesbank's policymaking council meets in Leipzig.
'The current exchange rate situation is in my opinion thoroughly appropriate
for the German economy,' Mr Tietmeyer said, arguing that after the
correction of exchange rates within the European exchange rate mechanism,
the recent weakening of the D-Mark was a 'normalisation process' as money
flowed out of the D-Mark back to other currencies.
'We must take care to ensure that this normalisation doesn't turn into
something entirely different,' he said.
Mr Tietmeyer said markets had confidence in the Bundesbank's monetary policy
'as they have always had,' and therefore he believed there would not be a
run on the D-Mark. But he pointed out that investors took account of
Germany's entire 'policy mix', including pay and fiscal policy as well as
social considerations.
The statements appear designed to exert more pressure on the political
establishment to agree meaningful cuts in public expenditure. Mr Theo
Waigel, finance minister, is finalising proposals for spending cuts in order
to tackle government borrowing requirements which are expected to reach 7.5
per cent of gross national product this year.
'We certainly don't want to keep interest rates unnecessarily high,' Mr
Tietmeyer said. 'Our main concern is to avoid the situation where if we cut
short-term interest rates, this leads to a rise in rates at the long end of
the yield curve.' This meant higher long-term interest rates.
He warned against trying to stimulate Germany's economy via rate cuts, but
said: 'This doesn't at all mean that interest rates at the short-term cannot
be brought down further.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICAN police last night said they had arrested four people in
connection with last Friday's attack by right wingers on the country's
democracy talks. The arrests eased pressure on president FW de Klerk who has
come under mounting criticism for failing to act swiftly against the right.
Police would not release the names of those arrested. It was not clear
whether the rightwing leaders who openly led the attack - well-known
politicians such as Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg, leader of the rightwing
Conservative Party and head of the official parliamentary opposition, along
with Mr Eugene Terreblanche, the leader of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance
Movement (AWB),and General Constand Viljoen, head of the Afrikaner
Volksfront, an umbrella right-wing group - had been arrested.
Mr de Klerk had promised arrests within 24 hours of the attack, which saw
leading politicians chased through the corridors of the constitutional
conference centre by armed men from the AWB.
Police said arrests were delayed by the fact that suspects had given them
false names, an explanation dismissed as ridiculous by Mr Nelson Mandela,
leader of the African National Congress.
Mr Mandela said last night the ANC was ready for violence from the right:
'If the rightwing thinks that they can use coercion and intimidation to get
what they are unable to get through negotiation, they are making a serious
mistake . . . And if they are thinking in terms of violence, we are ready
for that. We would not like to talk along those terms, but we are not going
to allow anybody to impose his will on the people of South Africa.'
Constitutional talks were due to continue this week despite the attack.

FT  28 JUN 93 / British retailers warned of threat to profits: Survey points
to challenge from discount stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH retailers risk a sharp decline in profitability unless they
drastically reduce their costs and improve operating efficiency, says a
study by McKinsey, the international management consultancy.
It says the British retailing industry increasingly faces market conditions
similar to those in the US. They included much greater price sensitivity
among consumers and the expansion of discount stores, which threatened sales
volumes at traditional outlets.
British retailers had yet to adjust to those challenges, though. On average,
they had much poorer productivity, higher labour costs and higher prices
than their American counterparts, which were more advanced in use of
automation.
McKinsey argues that keener competition will increase pressure on the UK
industry to move closer to US standards of efficiency and to lower prices.
It says British supermarkets are particularly exposed to these trends, even
though they are the only retail sector that is consistently more profitable
and efficient than in the US.
The unpublished study estimates that a 12 per cent cut in UK supermarkets'
prices would wipe out their profits. If they lowered prices to US levels,
they would need to reduce the prices they pay suppliers by 28 per cent, or
cut labour and fixed costs by 75 per cent, to maintain recent profitability.
The study is based on a survey of retail prices covering 268 products at
stores in the US and Britain. They include food and drink, clothing and
footwear, household products, consumer electronics, toys and cosmetics.
The survey finds that, on average, the products cost 32 per cent more in
Britain, including local taxes, and 22 per cent more before tax. The
comparison is based on the exchange rate of Dollars 1.60 to the pound when
the survey was made late last year.
The dollar has since risen to close at Dollars 1.478 to the pound in London
on Friday. However, the average difference between prices of the products
surveyed would not be eliminated unless the dollar rose above Dollars 1.22
to the pound.
The biggest price difference was for do-it-yourself goods, which were 77 per
cent more expensive in Britain, after tax, and the smallest was for
clothing, which cost 17 per cent more.
Prices at fast-food restaurants were 44 per cent higher in Britain, while
toys were 37 per cent dearer and electrical goods cost 29 per cent more.
Personal care products and food, most of which carries VAT at zero rates in
Britain, cost about a quarter more there.

FT  28 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Junk bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The revival in junk bonds over the past year suggests that market memories
are indeed short. Falling US deposit rates have forced investors away from
the relative security of the banks towards bond and equity markets.
Lacklustre performance there has tempted the brave back into high yield
paper. There is a case to be made for the move. Many of the junk bonds
currently being issued are on much more conservative terms than in the
heyday of 1987-89. Earnings are bottoming out rather than peaking. The risks
of corporate failure are undoubtedly lower.
Yet the substantial risks may not have been fully considered by buyers
disinclined to be fussy. Interest cover of two times on new leveraged
buy-outs is hardly generous. A rise in short rates would both tempt money
out of the junk market and put pressure on bond yields. Valuation criteria
for junk have been notoriously elastic. With little firm notion of good
value, prices could thus fall rapidly if sentiment changed. Mr Michael
Milken made a career and a fortune from the proposition that junk bonds were
mis-priced. Others lost vast amounts on the same notion. The clear winners
in junk were those companies which retired cheap equity in the late 1980s
with high yield bonds, survived, and are now buying back that junk cheaply
with more expensive shares. Investors who now regard junk as a double-digit
coupon bank deposit can expect little sympathy if it all turns sour.

FT  28 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Fisons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to take the bid speculation around Fisons seriously, not least
because there is no clear reason why anyone should want to buy the company.
Contested takeovers are rare in pharmaceuticals. Hanson's dry run at ICI
might be considered an exception, but that was predicated on the idea that
Zeneca would be sold off. Even if an adrenalin-charged predator overcame the
current aversion to hostile bids, he would find it difficult to unlock extra
value. The scientific instruments operations and remaining drug interests
would not be worth much more than the current market capitalisation.
Suggestions that Fisons is a recovery stock should also be treated with
caution. The scientific instruments business will be dogged by slow growth
in the US and no growth elsewhere in Europe. Drug prospects are dependent on
the launch of the Tilade asthma treatment in the US. The company has a niche
in respiratory drugs, but its existing products are starting to run out of
puff and there is little coming along to give a second wind.
A yield 50 per cent above the market average is a better support, especially
since the dividend looks secure. The unkind might suggest that is because
Fisons has nothing better to spend its money on. The company, meanwhile, is
presumably trying to licence compounds which will give it a shot in the arm.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The restructuring of European petrochemicals has yet to address the problem
of overcapacity. Last week's joint venture between Statoil of Norway and
Finland's Neste is a case in point. The duo are doubtless hoping for cost
savings, and access to Statoil's feedstocks will give the alliance a
competitive advantage. But plant closures are not part of the strategy. That
is equally the case with BASF's acquisition of ICI's polypropylene
interests, and Shell's proposed joint venture in plastics with Himont.
Without more drastic action, the current trough will be long and painful.
With European economies still deteriorating, demand is unlikely to pick up
until well into next year. Neste's view that the polypropylene market will
return to balance in 1996 - with polyethylene some way behind - is not
unusually pessimistic. But it is hard to see which of the European producers
will be first to swing the axe. ICI did most of the necessary pruning before
BASF stepped in. Both Neste and Himont run efficient plant. The presence of
state-owned companies such as Enichem may be a fundamental block to
restructuring.
On that basis, ICI's decision to negotiate its way out of polypropylene
looks wise. But with others seemingly braced for a long haul, it will be
hard pressed to find a buyer for the remaining petrochemicals business. Free
of debt following the demerger of Zeneca, ICI can afford to wait. Deprived
of cash flow from pharmaceuticals, though, it can hardly carry the business
through the next downturn.

FT  28 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Currency risks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar is struggling to live up to the expectations of strength with
which it started the year. Against the yen, it has slipped back to roughly
the level before the Japanese government fell. Though it has risen some 12
pfennigs against the D-Mark so far this month, the gain since January is
less than 5 per cent. Evidently, the market misjudged the interest rate
trend. The Bundesbank has been slow to cut. Poor regional inflation figures
on Friday do not enhance the prospect of significantly lower rates from this
week's council meeting. Meanwhile, the US recovery has slowed, lessening the
chance of higher interest rates there.
One question is whether currencies will continue to be driven by interest
rate differentials. Trade politics overshadow the yen. Arguably the D-Mark
is now suffering, like other European currencies before it, from a
perception that high interest rates are untenable in the face of deepening
recession. It would not do to push this theory too far, though. Given the
inflationary risk inherent in Germany's large budget deficit, the Bundesbank
must be anxious about relaxation if this affects long-term bond yields. The
US trade deficit hardly looks a good starting point for a robust dollar
recovery. Further dollar gains would drag the D-Mark down against the yen.
It already looks unnaturally cheap at Y62, which compares with Y89 as
recently as last August.
A spot of D-Mark resilience would not come amiss for the UK chancellor. He
is committed to raising taxes in November if the recovery proves too weak to
reduce the PSBR substantially. But since the underlying reason for higher
taxes would be economic weakness, it would be natural to accompany fiscal
tightening with monetary ease. That would be easier if he has not already
been driven into a premature rate cut by exporters complaining about
sterling's strength.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICAN president FW de Klerk faced mounting criticism last night
after he failed to fulfil a promise to act swiftly against rightwing groups
which staged an armed siege of constitutional negotiations last Friday.
Mr de Klerk had promised arrests within 24 hours of the attack, in which
some of the country's leading politicians were chased through the corridors
of the constitutional conference centre by armed men from the neo-Nazi
Afrikaner Resistance Movement).
The excuse given by police for failing to make the promised arrests - that
suspects had given them false names - was dismissed as ridiculous by Mr
Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress.
He pointed out that the attack was openly led by well-known politicians such
as Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg, leader of the rightwing Conservative party and head
of the official parliamentary opposition, along with Mr Eugene Terreblanche,
the AWB leader, and General Constand Viljoen, head of the Afrikaner
Volksfront, an umbrella rightwing group. Mr de Klerk had promised to arrest
these men, but last night they remained at liberty.
Constitutional talks were scheduled to continue this week despite the
attack, with Afrikaner self-determination - the issue which Friday's protest
was meant to promote - at the top of the agenda.
However, progress in the talks has clearly been delayed by the attack. Mr
Mandela said on Saturday, as he left for a visit to the US, that he would
not call as planned for international sanctions against South Africa to be
lifted.
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Inkatha Freedom party leader, stressed in
response to the attack that the fears of white South Africans could be
'terribly destructive' and should be taken seriously. His party, which is in
alliance with the Conservative party within the Concerned South Africans
Group (Cosag), has been severely criticised for siding with the racist
right.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Tietmeyer plays down weak D-Mark and hints at rate cut
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK sees the current weakness of the D-Mark as part of a
'normalisation' process and not the start of a run on the currency, Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, its vice-president, said yesterday.
In a radio interview he also reiterated the commitment of the German central
bank to bringing down interest rates when conditions are appropriate - a
statement which, in conjunction with his apparent nonchalance about the
currency, may stimulate hopes of further early cuts in interest rates. These
could come as early as Thursday when the Bundesbank's policymaking council
meets in Leipzig, some economists believe.
'The current exchange rate situation is in my opinion thoroughly appropriate
for the German economy,' Mr Tietmeyer said, arguing that after the
correction of exchange rates within the European exchange rate mechanism,
the recent weakening of the D-Mark was a 'normalisation process' as money
flowed out of the D-Mark back to the original currencies.
'We must take care to ensure that this normalisation doesn't turn into
something entirely different,' he said.
Mr Tietmeyer said that markets had confidence in the Bundesbank's monetary
policy 'as they have always had,' and therefore he believed there would not
be a run on the D-Mark. But he pointed out that investors took account of
Germany's entire 'policy mix', including pay and fiscal policy as well as
social considerations. Decisions taken by the government, by unions and by
businesses were all important.
The statements appear designed to exert more pressure on the political
establishment to agree meaningful cuts in public expenditure. Mr Theo
Waigel, finance minister, is finalising proposals for spending cuts in order
to tackle government borrowing requirements which are expected to reach 7.5
per cent of gross national product this year.
'We certainly don't want to keep interest rates unnecessarily high,' Mr
Tietmeyer said. 'Our main concern is to avoid the situation where if we cut
short-term interest rates, this leads to a rise in rates at the long end of
the yield curve' (ie higher long-term interest rates).
He warned against trying to stimulate Germany's economy via rate cuts,
saying that could be counterproductive. 'But this doesn't at all mean that
interest rates at the short-term cannot be brought down further.' The D-Mark
last week sank to a post-war low against the yen, and fell to DM1.70 against
the US dollar, from DM1.62 over two weeks. Interest rates in France fell
below those in Germany for the first time in 26 years, leading to
suggestions that the French franc could replace the D-Mark as anchor of the
ERM.

What a difference a decade makes. Remember Gilles Loiselle, the Quebec
agent-general in London in the early 1980s, who used to champion the case
for his province breaking away from the rest of Canada?
Well, the former separatist has now popped up as finance minister for all of
Canada in Kim Campbell's new cabinet. Before entering politics, Loiselle was
a TV reporter in Montreal and one of his last assignments was to cover
Charles de Gaulle's famous Vive le Quebec Libre outburst in 1967.
How Loiselle came to be converted to the federalist cause remains a bit of a
mystery. But he does have experience of one country torn apart by civil
strife, having spent most of his 20s teaching in Ethiopia - where,
incidentally, he became fluent in Amharic and Italian. His name might not be
known in the world's banking parlours, but he could be just the man to
organise the next international aid effort to Ethiopia, should the need
arise.

The BBC has already upset some listeners by picking Columbia University's
professor Edward Said to give its 1993 Reith lectures, considered by some an
important event in British intellectual life. Now it seems that BBC has
upset the professor also. The Radio Times, the BBC's listings magazine, had
described Said as a 'prominent PLO activist'. However, the latest issue
carries an apology which is almost as long as the original puff for the
lecture. Said has been a prominent supporter of the Palestinian cause for
many years but at no time has he been a member of the PLO.

No doubt it is sheer coincidence that only a couple of days after Jacques
Attali resigns from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
Sir William Ryrie announces his retirement as head of the International
Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private-sector arm.
Even so, Ryrie's departure could come in handy if the great powers run into
difficulty finding the right pawn to fill the EBRD slot. Unlike Attali,
Ryrie can look back with some pride on his nine years with the IFC. Morale
is high, the IFC's triple A credit rating is secure, and it will invest more
than Dollars 2bn in 170 projects this year. Even more important, it made
Dollars 180m after tax for its shareholders last year.
In many respects, the IFC ought to be the EBRD's role model. Doubtless,
there would be diplomatic problems about replacing Attali with a Brit,
especially since Sir Brian Unwin has just bagged the top job at the European
Investment Bank. Even so, Ryrie would be an ideal stand-in until a more
politically correct figure can be found.

Legend has it that Princess Anne's predecessor as Princess Royal threw a
wobbly on seeing the evening paper's headline after she opened a new town
hall in the 1930s, a routine ceremony she had performed many times before.
The opening certainly hadn't included the event, or the animal, denoted by
the paper which was published in a city 25 miles away. The headline shouted:
Princess Royal strokes
sea lion at opening
While her mind could only have boggled at how the fictitious sea lion came
into being, the process is agonisingly familiar to newspaper staff. Not only
can it happen to us all but, despite new technology, it still does.
The reporter covering the opening dictated his report by telephone. Late in
his story, he mentioned that as the Princess Royal got out of her car she
stroked a stray cat on the pavement. But preferring long words to short
ones, he called it not a cat, but a feline.
Mis-hearing it, the staff member taking the dictation wrote down 'sea lion'.
That seemed worth top prominence to the sub-editor preparing the story, who
promoted the fictionalised incident to the first paragraph, penned the
headline, and hey presto]
Recent progeny of the sea lion include a most creative invention in the
Independent. A writer telephoning in an article about Britain's National
Vocational Qualifications, called them by the acronym NVQs. So were born
'envy queues' which, now we know of their existence, can be seen all around.
The latest example, however, is less fortunate. It arose after Professor
Malcolm Bradbury dictated to The Times an obituary of the novelist, the late
Sir William Golding, who was known for his impish sense of fun. Bradbury
alluded to it by describing him as a 'half-wicked old schoolmaster'. Sure
enough, the 'ck' was mis-heard as a double 't', and . . . .

FT  28 JUN 93 / The sleeping giant awakes: China and its neighbours are
poised to become the next economic heavyweight. How should the world
respond, asks Martin Wolf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I suggest we abandon the absolutism of free trade. This was the doctrine
established in our most glorious period of economic growth, when the coolies
of Asia were restricted to pulling rickshaws. These times have passed: the
coolies now sit at computer screens.
Claude Imbert, editor of Le Point.
China? There lies a sleeping giant - let him sleep] For when he wakes he
will move the world.
Napoleon, emperor of the French.
China is waking. The shape of the world in the next century will be
determined by how the advanced industrial countries respond.
The industrial countries dominate the world economy. They generate 54 per
cent of world gross product, measured at common international prices. At
market exchange rates, their share of global GDP is 73 per cent. Some 79 per
cent of world merchandise exports and 87 per cent of exports of manufactures
come from the industrial countries. Even excluding trade in manufactures
within the European Community, the advanced country share of manufactured
exports is 82 per cent.
The most important change in relative economic position this century has
been Japan's move to become the world's second largest economy. This was
important in itself, but also for what it foreshadowed. Hong Kong,
Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea have followed Japan's path. But their
chief importance is as an example. With combined populations of less than
70m, these four small economies will never shake the world.
The potential for further rapid economic development in Asia, particularly
in China, is vast.
Asia contains more than half of the world's population.
The gap in real income per head between the large Asian developing countries
and industrial countries has grown very large.
The gulf in labour costs, at market exchange rates, is larger still.
Gaps in output per head indicate the economic potential of poorer countries.
They also show that catching up is difficult. Most Asian countries,
including the largest, have only recently begun to make the leap into what
Nobel-laureate Simon Kuznets called 'modern economic growth'. The reasons
for their long delay have included imperialism, internal instability
(notably in China), two world wars, inter-war chaos and, partly in reaction
to all of these, the inward-looking and etatiste development ideologies of
the postwar era.
Today's transformation is symbolised by the fate of the Soviet Union. This
is an era not of a great leap forward, but more of a great leap outward.
Many developing countries are going where Taiwan and South Korea have led.
China has already shown it can do so. According to admittedly imperfect
national statistics, Chinese economic growth was 9 1/2 per cent a year in
the 1980s. At this rate an economy doubles every seven to eight years.
The World Bank talks of a greater China or 'Chinese Economic Area', which
includes Hong Kong and Taiwan:
At the market exchange rate, its GDP was Dollars 600bn (Pounds 400bn) in
1991, about half that of France. But measured at common international prices
(that is, by revaluing output in all countries using the same prices) its
GDP was greater than Japan's.
Its imports are already two-thirds as large as Japan's and could exceed them
within 10 years. 1
If China were to sustain growth of income per head at 7-8 per cent a year
for another 20 years, it would only attain the real income per head achieved
by Japan in the mid-1970s. But between now and 2012, its GDP would grow
six-fold. Expressed in international prices, its economy would be as big as
the US and Japanese combined, but should still have opportunities for
relatively rapid growth.
China is not alone. In the 1980s, rapid growth was also achieved by South
Korea (9.7 per cent a year), Taiwan (8.0 per cent), Thailand (7.6 per cent),
Hong Kong (7.1 per cent), Singapore (6.4 per cent), Indonesia (5.5 per cent)
and Malaysia (5.2 per cent). Vietnam is taking off, while even India managed
growth averaging 5.3 per cent.
The combined populations of these countries is, it should be remembered,
close to 2.5bn. What could stop their onward march? Political instability is
one threat. But it is difficult to stop industrial development once it is
entrenched. Protectionism abroad is another. But Asian countries can support
each other. Their manufactured exports to Japan and one another are already
as large as to the US.
The world is at the beginning of the fourth great change in the relative
economic weight of countries since the industrial revolution. The first was
the rise of the UK. The second was the onset of the US and, to a lesser
extent, Germany. Japan's rise though not as important as the earlier two,
made the third.
Brian Reading of Lombard Street Research makes a persuasive comparison of
the present epoch with the late 19th century. 2 1873-96 was a period of
falling prices and, for that reason, was widely thought of as a depression.
But it was, in fact, a period of rapid expansion. Between the civil war and
the first world war US industrial output increased some 10-fold. By 1913 the
US generated a third of global industrial output, more than Germany and the
UK together.
Such upheavals have potentially devastating effects:
They transform relative power, leading often to war: the US ended up in
conflicts, hot or cold, with Germany, Japan and Russia.
They destabilise the world economy: the great depression of the 1930s, the
failure to restore the gold standard and the collapse of the treaty-based
commercial policy system of the 19th century were largely explained by the
refusal of the US to abide by the old rules.
They also impose painful economic adjustments.
The rise of Asian economies may create still greater difficulties for
established powers than did the previous changes. The rise of the US and
Germany were associated with the rapid growth of new industries, such as
chemicals. The same has been partly true of Japan. But Asian development is
based on making things more cheaply. Its principal resource is diligent and,
by industrial country standards, frighteningly cheap labour.
The growth of global income inequality has created a new opportunity for
specialisation, within manufacturing, on the basis of relative labour costs.
Between 1981 and 1991 exports of manufactures from east Asian developing
countries grew at 12.8 per cent a year in real terms, while those from
industrial countries grew at only 4.4 per cent. Nevertheless, manufactured
exports from east Asian economies still accounted for only 18 per cent of
world exports in 1991, even with trade inside the EC excluded.
The advent of competitive exports from developing countries has, inevitably,
led to resurrection of the 'pauper labour fallacy'. But:
Low wages do not mean Asian developing countries can undercut everything
industrial countries produce; those wages reflect low productivity.
The majority of Chinese would not benefit from having their wages pushed up
prematurely and they would also not gain from a Gatt social chapter aimed at
depriving them of their best hope of escape from mass poverty.
Advanced countries would not lose all export opportunities. On the contrary,
between 1981 and 1991 industrial country manufactured exports to east Asian
developing countries grew at 8.6 per cent a year, faster than to any other
markets.
Growth of labour-intensive exports from Asia offers substantial overall
benefits to industrial countries, as well as to owners of physical capital
and to skilled labour. But it is also likely to lower the relative wages of
unskilled workers.
A classic theorem in international trade, 'factor price equalisation',
suggests that incomes from labour and capital would be equalised by free
trade. The assumptions underlying the theorem are unrealistic. Yet there
could well be a tendency towards equalisation, as labour-intensive
industries shrink.
Apart from the size of the wage gap between North and South, there are two
other reasons why this tendency may now be more important than before: most
developing countries are, for the first time, trying to exploit their
comparative advantage, rather than fight it; and the capacity to transfer
technology, communicate with far-flung factories and transport their output
to distant markets has also steadily increased.
The extent to which exports of manufactures have already driven down demand
for - and relative wages of - unskilled labour in rich countries is
controversial.
Adrian Wood of the Institute of Development Studies at Sussex University
argues that the cumulative effect, to 1990, of North-South trade in
manufactures was to lower demand for unskilled labour in Northern economies,
as a proportion of 1985 employment, by 6 per cent and demand for
manufacturing labour by 12 per cent. 3 These are not negligible figures.
More recently, two American academics, Robert Lawrence of Harvard University
and Matthew Slaughter of MIT, conclude for the US, where trade has been
frequently invoked as an explanation, that it 'has not been the major source
of US average and relative wage performance in the 1980s'. 4
Whatever the truth about the past, continued rapid expansion of exports of
manufactures from developing countries is likely to have a significant
effect on future demand for unskilled labour. The idiot's answer is
protection. But the piecemeal protection reluctantly suggested by
Jean-Claude Paye, secretary-general of the OECD, would be irrelevant. High
and sustained protection against all imports of labour-intensive
manufactures would be needed.
Such a policy would be open to powerful objections:
Protection would fail to preserve lost export markets, unless rich countries
were to create a discriminatory free trade area against poorer ones.
It would shift resources from efficient export industry to inefficient
import-competing industry;
It would lower aggregate economic welfare and impose a large tax on rich
country consumers of labour-intensive products; and
It would create growing friction between old economic powers and new ones.
A far better response would be a mixture of investment in education with
subsidies to unskilled employment. But pressures to retreat behind a
protectionist wall against Asian exporters of manufactures are bound to
grow. Defeating those pressures will need courage and imagination.
Morally, it would be wrong to block the peaceful commercial road to economic
progress. Practically, the growth of China and its neighbours offers
enticing economic opportunities. In deciding which way to turn, Europe and
North America should remember that China was once the world's richest
civilisation. In the 15th century the imperial court decided to halt
commercial contact with those they thought barbarians. The rest is 500 years
of unhappy history.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development did not already
exist, it would perhaps now not be necessary to invent it. The bank does,
however, exist, with a mandate to promote the vital objective of
regenerating eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The EBRD has spent
two years establishing its credentials in a troubled economic and political
environment. After Friday's announcement of the departure of its president,
Mr Jacques Attali, the bank must address a host of questions on its future
responsibilities, management and leadership.
The first task is to win back the confidence of its partners and
shareholders, not least the US, which is demanding changes as a condition
for paying its next year's capital allocation. Much hope, as well as money,
has been invested in this institution. In the interest of Europe east and
west, it needs urgently to find the right answers.
Criticism of the bank's operations has centred on two areas. First, start-up
costs - on both buildings and personnel - have been too high. Responsibility
for excess spending on the bank's London headquarters lies not only with the
EBRD, but also with shareholder governments, which should have checked more
closely spending of taxpayers' cash.
Caution
Second, bureaucratic procedures, partly a reflection of top-heavy
management, have held back disbursements of loans and equity. A recent
report commissioned by Mr Attali concluded the bank had failed to make
sufficient impact. At a time of great difficulty for the fledgling
private-sector entrepreneurial activities which the EBRD was set up to
support, the bank justifiably stresses the need for caution. Its resources,
after all, stem from the public sector, and there are inevitable
complexities in providing funds in co-financing deals. None the less, the
EBRD needs to search more energetically for smaller venture capital-type
outlets for its funds. It can also learn from the European Investment Bank,
which in some ways has a better record for disbursing relatively low-cost
loans in eastern Europe, as a small part of its overall credit business.
To address its perceived failings, the EBRD has recently proposed a
management shake-up. This is centred on the appointment of Mr Ernest Stern,
the present number two at the World Bank, in a new chief executive position.
The bank's board has also been debating a shift away from the EBRD's
concentration on private-sector projects towards World Bank-style lending
for public-sector development.
Flexibility
There is certainly merit in interpreting with as much flexibility as
possible the bank's statutory duty to channel 60 per cent of its loans to
the private sector. Greater emphasis on public-sector infrastructure
finance, however, would heighten the need for better co-ordination with
other public lending agencies, above all the World Bank.
Mr Attali backed the proposed management restructuring, but now that the
bank is seeking a new president as well as a new approach, it would be
sensible to delay the changes until a successor has been appointed. The bank
should use the time to take speedy outside advice on increasing its
efficiency, in the same way that it has asked external accountants to
examine charges of over-spending. It may also be that the bank needs fewer
and less interventionist executive directors.
Mr Attali's decision to quit was painful, but necessary. The question of who
takes over is crucial. The EBRD needs to find a president of calibre,
experience and energy, combining genuine commitment to European integration
with aptitude for the practical side of running a multinational bank. Mr
Jacques de Larosiere, the governor of the Bank of France and former IMF
managing director, possesses some of those attributes, as do Mr Onno Ruding,
the former Dutch finance minister, and Mr Karl Otto Pohl and Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, the past and present heads of the Bundesbank. The EBRD's role
is to aid economies ruined by decades of mismanagement. A quick recovery
from its own debacle would strengthen Europe's chances of achieving this
essential goal.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Hard to justify
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's weekend raid on Baghdad was a classic exercise in
the art of soliciting domestic support by running up the flag and demanding
that everyone salute it. It is hard to justify in terms of international
law, or any conception of a new world order. But it can most readily be
explained by reference to what is expedient in US politics. In that sense it
may be effective. The initial reaction in the US suggests that the
expenditure of 23 Cruise missiles, and an unknown number of Iraqi lives, on
Sunday morning's missile attack may increase popular support for a president
whose first few months in office have been marred by dither in the White
House, and whose authority over a Congress nominally controlled by his own
Democratic party has been shown to be tenuous.
Americans traditionally respect decisiveness in their chief executive. They
are conscious of the standing of their nation as the world's sole remaining
superpower. They may be expected to rally round on an occasion like this, as
they did when President Ronald Reagan sent F-111s to bomb Colonel Gadaffi's
home in Libya. Many of them are naturally irritated by the fact that, in
spite of the victory of the US-led coalition in the Gulf war, President
Saddam Hussein has survived for longer than most of them expected when the
ceasefire document was signed. That being the general sentiment, evidence
that there was a terrorist plot to kill former president Bush during his
visit to Kuwait in April will be regarded by US politicians of all parties
as ample justification for the action taken by Mr Clinton.
Provocation
The US argument, put to the Security Council yesterday, is that this kind of
provocation could not be allowed to go unanswered. Washington has a point
here, albeit a harsh one. The raids on Libya were followed by a reduction in
terrorism emanating from that quarter; perhaps, it is reasoned, the Iraqis
will be similarly cowed - a view apparently shared by the British and other
governments. Yet it is highly questionable whether the missile raid can be
justified in law. President Clinton is relying on Article 51 of the UN
charter, which preserves the inherent right of any state to act in its own
self-defence. But can this be used to justify a punitive attack on a city
centre in response to accusations of an assassination plot as yet unproven
in any court?
Principles
More to the point, there is no moral justification for the raid. On the
facts as presented by the US, the president should have waited for the
completion of the trial of 11 Iraqis on terrorism charges in Kuwait before
contemplating action against their headquarters in Baghdad. Any punitive
action should be sanctioned in advance by the Security Council. If it is to
involve risk to the lives of civilians, a question must be asked about what
principles the administration applies in deciding who and where to attack.
The question is painfully obvious. Why will the US bomb Moslems in Iraq and
Somalia, but take no action against Serbs who are slaughtering Moslems in
Bosnia? One answer is that it is only in the latter case that US troops
would have to be deployed; another, already put forward yesterday, that
lives in the third world are regarded as expendable. However unjustified,
such suspicions will ensure that the US relationship with the Islamic
nations, scarred by many historic wounds, will once again suffer as a result
of the weekend action.
There should also be, to say the least, a sense of discomfort in Europe,
which is witnessing the carve-up of former Yugoslavia by the Croats and
Serbs at a time when disagreements among the members of Nato over the use of
force against the Bosnian Serbs have prevented the US from taking a leading
part in bringing the Balkan conflict to a conclusion.
As Mr Bush showed in the Gulf, a president experienced in international
affairs, and therefore able to bring both his Nato allies and the UN (plus
several Middle Eastern states) into a grand coalition, could offer at least
the hope that the US might help to create a new world order. Mr Clinton has
failed to create an alliance over Bosnia, and has not yet made a convincing
case under international law for his actions in Iraq.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Tactics to defuse a time bomb: The UK government is delaying
making tough decisions on pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government may finally be thinking the unthinkable, according to Mr
Peter Lilley, the social security secretary.
He suggested last week that perhaps it was time to consider slaughtering
some of the sacred cows of the UK's state pension system. Like most other
industrial nations, Britain faces a demographic time bomb as its population
ages and the burden of providing state pensions falls on fewer workers.
Mr Lilley hinted at two possibilities, both politically unpalatable:
targeting the basic state pension at those who need it most, and raising the
age at which it becomes available.
While the government says it is not considering the first, it is actively
studying the second. However, while it ponders, the pensions industry is
becoming increasingly concerned about the lack of a coherent policy for the
next century.
'I think we have a void in that we don't have an agreed government policy on
pensions,' said Mr Ron Amy, group compensation and benefits manager at Grand
Metropolitan, the food, drinks and retailing group, and chairman of the UK's
pensions industry trade body, the National Association of Pension Funds.
At the association's annual meeting in Harrogate last month, Mr Amy
announced plans for a national campaign to stimulate discussion with the
government about the state's role in pension provision. 'The concern we have
is that there is clearly going to be a declining level of state provision of
benefits. We want the government to tell us how its cuts in state pension
fit into its plans for overall pension provision in 30 years,' Mr Amy said.
The focal point for industry frustration is the government's failure to
equalise state pension ages for men and women. While men are not entitled to
receive pensions until they reach 65, women become eligible at 60, an
anomaly of most occupational schemes as well.
Following a judgment by the European Court of Justice in May 1990 that
occupational schemes had to offer the same terms to all members, employers
began taking steps to equalise the age of eligibility. The UK government
estimated that, by raising women's retirement ages to 65, it could save
about Pounds 3bn a year.
However, while most of Europe has equalised retirement ages, Britain has
hesitated. A white paper on pensions policy has been postponed again and is
not likely to be published until the autumn.
The delay is a particular problem for employers with occupational pension
schemes. One element of funding by employers is provided by the government
through rebates of National Insurance contributions. To claim the rebate,
employers must guarantee benefits to scheme subscribers equal to those
available under the State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme.
Because women tend to live longer than men and retire earlier, employers
have to contribute more to their occupational pensions to give them the same
monthly benefit as men of the same age. The more generous contribution for
women is reflected in government rebates.
This could prove costly after a second judgment, expected from the European
Court in August. It is likely to rule that if employers provide more
valuable pensions for women, they must do the same for men. Thus, the
government's failure to equalise retirement ages could increase employers'
pension bills.
'If you are an employer, you can't bite the bullet and provide truly equal
pensions until the government does,' said Mr Colin Evans, senior actuary at
consulting actuaries William M Mercer and Co.
Mr William Hague, under-secretary of state for pensions, said that, while
the government was aware of employers' concerns, it did not wish to make a
rash decision. 'There is no need for indecent haste,' he said. The
government planned to hold consultations with the pensions industry in the
autumn, he said.
The widespread view in the industry is that the government has no
alternative but to raise women's retirement age; only fear of a political
backlash is preventing it from doing so. 'The civil servants at the
Department of Social Security have ideas to solve these problems but the
government hasn't got the mettle to take anything forward,' said Mr Gary
Simmons, director and actuary at benefit consultants Wyatt and Co.
While inactivity on equalising pension ages is the most pressing issue, the
industry is also worried about the slow shift from public- to private-sector
pension provision.
In 1988, the government announced that annual state pension increases would
be tied not to earnings, which rise faster than inflation, but to retail
prices. This switch has cut the projected cost of state benefits to Pounds
32.6bn by 2050 rather than a figure of Pounds 79.7bn if benefits rose with
earnings.
The UK's state pension bill, which was Pounds 22.2bn in the 1990-91 fiscal
year, will cost Pounds 34.7bn by its peak year of 2030, and there will be
fewer taxpayers to share the cost because of changing demographics. The
Institute for Fiscal Studies calculates that, while there are now 3.3
workers for every pensioner, there will be only 2.4 for each pensioner by
2030.
Pegging pension increases to prices rather than earnings also means that
state benefits will become too small to provide even a minimal standard of
living for an old person. According to the institute, state benefits will
fall to 7 per cent of national average earnings by 2010 from about 17 per
cent now. The UK state pension is already one of the lowest in Europe.
Government critics in the pensions industry charge that its spending on the
promotion of personal pensions is misguided, because such schemes cannot
replace state benefits. Some pensions professionals say that personal
schemes shift investment risk to the individual, are expensive to administer
and are often sold to those who do not need them.
Estimates from the life insurance industry suggest that 50 per cent to 66
per cent of the 5m-odd personal pension plans sold annually in Britain are
funded solely with government rebates from National Insurance contributions.
The figures suggest that about Pounds 6bn worth of rebates since 1988 have
gone into personal pension schemes and that little saving by individuals has
been encouraged. 'Personal pensions have been an enormously expensive
failure,' said Mr Evans, citing high surrender rates and high expense
ratios.
The government has implicitly conceded some of this failing and has
announced it will restructure the system of tax rebates for personal
pensions from April 1996.
Mr Robin Ellison, partner at pensions solicitors Ellison Westhorp and a
member of the Occupational Pensions Board, the pensions watchdog, said the
government had yet to decide on the role for private provision, and whether
employers and individuals should have the option of contributing to personal
or occupational schemes.
Mr Frank Field, the maverick Labour MP who chairs the select committee on
social security, argues that only radical solutions are now possible. 'And
the government is not sufficiently radical in its thinking,' he said. 'The
time has come to universalise private pension provision with the government
only providing benefits for those who have no alternative.'
Private provision should be compulsory for both workers and employers, with
the state contributing to the personal plans of only those who cannot work,
he adds.
The questions facing Mr Lilley are first, whether the government can
continue providing state pensions for all, regardless of need. A move away
from that, no matter how cost-effective, would provoke a political outcry,
which the government can ill-afford.
Second, he must confront the issue of inequality in state pension ages and
brace himself for the backlash. Failure to make tough choices now will limit
the government's ability to deliver a sensible, long-term policy for the
future.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Letter: More than one side to executives' rolling contracts
story
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RONNIE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The criticism of three- year rolling term service agreements and
substantial termination payments in Mr Alastair Ross Goobey's letter to
chairmen of FTSE-100 companies has prompted much press comment ('The gravy
train bumps along', June 22).
My experience as a corporate lawyer specialising in the calculation of
termination payments suggests that there is another side to this story.
The starting point for calculating a payment on termination of employment is
the amount that the executive would have earned during the unexpired notice
period. The length of the notice period is a matter for negotiation in the
same way as other benefits. Britain has a tradition of under-valuing the
contribution made by the men and women responsible for generating millions
of pounds of turnover and motivating thousands of employees.
We are seeing many chairmen, chief executives, managing directors and
finance directors being sacked for no fault of their own. In the 1980s
companies needed leaders who could build businesses, integrate acquisitions
and promote their companies. In the 1990s, companies need directors who can
control costs, downsize sensitively and focus on core products. Many
FTSE-100 companies have appreciated the importance of treating fairly those
individuals who have been required to leave.
There has been a well-documented shift in the control of Britain's quoted
companies from private individual investors to professional fund managers.
Too often such managers are judged on the basis of their short-term
performance and naturally they tend to judge the companies in which they
invest the same way. Time and again we are seeing institutional pressure for
changes in senior management as a result of a single year's drop in profits
or even a single ill-judged decision.
Much nonsense is spoken on the subject of mitigation. In current economic
conditions a senior executive who is required to leave a major public
company in his 50s is extremely unlikely to find a comparable job. The
financial and psychological impact on the executive and members of his
family may be devastating.
There are two sides to every story. I hope that decisions on termination
payments will continue to be made in the light of all the relevant economic
and legal considerations and not just on the basis of the press comments
prompted by Mr Goobey's remarks.

Sir, The arguments you make against the managed trade strategies proposed
recently by Fred Bergsten and Marcus Noland of the Institute for
International Economics ('Strong-arm tactics', June 25) are most convincing.
Another weakness of those demands becomes obvious from the table you show in
your article: as you mention, conditions in Japan change rapidly and - as
even many proponents of managed trade would admit - most formal restrictions
on entry to Japanese markets have been lifted in recent years. The arguments
for managed trade presented by the Institute for International Economics are
obviously based on outdated figures.
For example, during the Bubble Keizai, ie after 1987, Japanese consumers
developed strong preferences for foreign luxury goods. As a result, imports
of passenger cars and other luxury goods to Japan rose dramatically. Thus,
it does not make much sense to look at foreign companies' share of domestic
sales in 1986 in search of 'reconcilable differences'. They might have
vanished in between.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Letter: EBRD goals in danger of compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KARL A ZIEGLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Regarding Robert Peston's European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development expose ('Top EBRD official accuses Attali of misleading him',
June 23): most of the original justification for the establishment of the
EBRD could have be compromised by Jacques Attali's apparently self-serving
effort to make the new group a World Bank clone, thereby perhaps saving his
job, while compromising his earlier stated goals for the bank.
Ernest Stern's record at the World Bank is intimately linked with failed
government-administered project lending. The World Bank's more recent
'structural adjustment lending' can be seen as a thinly veiled effort at
funding countries which would otherwise have to default on earlier failed
Bank project lending.
Mr Freeman, first vice-president of EBRD, is right to emphasise the new
bank's private-sector bias, only in those countries which respect the rule
of law and contract. It is this aspect which set the original EBRD apart
from the shopworn policies of the 'traditional development banks'. His
arguments must prevail in the EBRD director's deliberations.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Letter: Real difficulties will result from arts grant cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON MUNDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Antony Thorncroft is right to think ('Off the Wall', June 19) the arts
will tremble if views ascribed to Iain Sproat, the new junior minister at
the national heritage department, typify those of the government as a whole.
Luckily, they do not seem to at the moment.
However there is little evidence that the creation of the new senior
department has yet yielded any great benefits to the arts. All that has
happened so far is the promise of a Pounds 5m cut in the Arts Council's
grant for next year so that more money can go to the blighted British
Library building.
Although Pounds 5m only represents 2 per cent of the Arts Council's budget
the damage will be out of all proportion to the size of the cash cut. In the
arts a little money goes a long way. The government has been successful in
making sure that, with such a plural system of funding, the multiplier
effect of the small amount it gives is highly efficient. Even in companies
where public support represents a small part of total budgets, its partial
withdrawal will lead to real difficulties, especially where there are cuts
in local authority grants, sponsorship and box office income to add into the
equation.
If we were only worried about the grants to big arts companies things would
be bad enough. Coming together with the collapse of much of the arts
education system and a dangerously flawed lottery bill, the position
requires rather more energetic attention than the government seems prepared
to contemplate.

FT  28 JUN 93 / That manufacturing fallacy again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Towards the end of Gustav Mahler's monumental Resurrection Symphony, the
chorus and mezzo soprano intone words that mean: 'Cease to tremble; prepare
yourself to live.'
The Austrian composer was thinking of profound and personal matters.
Nevertheless the sentiments apply diminuendo to the ingrained tendency of
the British economic and business establishments to look for signs of gloom
and doom at the start of what could be the most promising period of
non-inflationary growth that Britain has had for years.
As usual, many of these doom-laden worries relate to the UK manufacturing
trade deficit. Such worries reflect the cultural lag of people who 'still
characterise the UK as a country which exports manufactured goods in order
to import food to eat and raw materials to keep the wheels of industry
turning'. This summary comes from a paper by Sir James Ball and Donald
Robertson in the new June issue of the London Business School Review.
The authors start from the historical transformation that has occurred in
British overseas trade. If you compare 1960 with 1990 one change has been
that invisible receipts rose from 37 per cent to 53 per cent of the total.
This makes the view that contributions from services can never substitute
for manufacturing earnings difficult to understand.
But an even bigger change has taken place on the import side. Manufactured
goods rose from 34 per cent of total overseas payments in 1960 to 79 per
cent in 1990. Imports of goods were, however, only half of total overseas
payments. Invisibles, including interest profits and dividends, accounted
for the other half.
The UK does not need to export manufactured goods 'to pay its way in the
world', as Crippsian rhetoric suggested, but to import other manufactured
goods. Increased specialisation and exchange within industrial sectors is
the way in which trade has developed among advanced countries.
Of course, overseas earnings have still to balance overseas expenditure
after allowing for investment inflows. Straight-forward economics would
suggest that, if a country avoided excessive home demand and allowed the
terms of trade to adjust, then any required correction would occur without a
lot of fussy intervention.
Is there really some horrendous difficulty about achieving such an
adjustment which affects the UK - or on some formulations, also the US and
other English-speaking countries - but not other parts of the world?
There is now ample evidence that the UK's share of world trade in
manufacturing stopped falling in the early 1980s and may even have been
rising slightly. Any structural difficulty must therefore be on the import
side.
A highly useful LBS table suggests, however, that the UK was far from unique
in experiencing a rapid rise in imports, either in the 1980s or over a
longer period. Only France among big industrial countries failed to show
bigger import penetration over the last decade. The pace of expansion varied
over the years. In the US imports grew more rapidly in the first half of the
1980s. In Japan, Germany and the UK the expansionary burst was in the second
half of the decade.
The authors make a great deal of the excess demand that developed in the UK
following the credit explosion, which they believe was the main reason for
the shock-horror Pounds 21.7bn payments deficit of 1989. The question then
arises: why has the deficit fallen only moderately in the subsequent years
of severe recession? (This question takes the official estimates at their
face value, even though UK overseas receipts buried in the black hole of the
'balancing item' are now once again larger than the deficit itself.)
The first reason for the continued deficit may simply be the lag between the
cooling of the UK home market and its working through to imports. Second, as
the Bundesbank always argued, sterling was overvalued in the early 1990s -
not so much against the D-Mark, but against the currency basket. Third, once
devaluation made the pound highly competitive, the European recession began
to take its toll.
A current payments deficit is to be expected in a growing country in a
recessionary world. So long as overseas investors are willing to finance
this at non-usurious interest rates, it is both in the UK and international
interest to run it. When both the world and the UK recovery have proceeded
further, it will be important to tackle that part of the payments deficit
that reflects the red ink in the public sector. Kenneth Clarke's threat to
increase taxes 'if growth shows signs of faltering ' gets the logic
precisely the wrong way round.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Arts: Ariadne auf Naxos - Opera in Zurich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some singers fancy themselves as conductors, others try their hand at stage
direction. Producers such as Ruth Berghaus and Johannes Schaaf have played
roles in their own stagings. But what about the opera administrator who, not
content with a planning and enabling role, fancies himself as an artist and
casts himself in a performance in his own theatre? Step forward Alexander
Pereira, intendant of the Zurich Opera House, who has just appeared in the
company's new Ariadne auf Naxos, one of the few repertoire operas with a
speaking role.
This isn't the first time Pereira has let enthusiasm get the better of
himself. He once joined Orlofsky's party in Die Fledermaus. And who hasn't
wondered, at one point or other, what it would be like to be up there
sharing the glamour of the stars? But Pereira's performance as the
Major-Domo in Ariadne should be a warning to any amateur who wants to play
with the professionals. A tall, limp figure, he lacked the snobby
imperiousness essential to the part, delivering his lines with the gauche
self-consciousness one expects when the Count delivers his recitation in
Capriccio. At the interval, Pereira reverted to his role as administrator,
mingling in costume with guests in the foyer.
Pereira came to Zurich two years ago without any previous experience of
running a theatre. What Zurich fell for were his marketing skills and the
cachet of his Viennese background. In his first season he increased
sponsorship, promoted some young talent and raised box-office takings by
engaging star singers. Now doubts are setting in. Zurich has become a haven
for singers who made their name 20 or 30 years ago but are long past their
best - such as Hermann Prey, whose Music Master in Ariadne looked and
sounded as if he had lost sight of the purpose of being on stage.
Productions veer between the trendy and the still-born. There is more show
than substance.
Some performances have been redeemed by the conducting - but not Ariadne.
Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos, an experienced Straussian in the concert hall,
failed to draw the disparate strands of this elusive score into a convincing
whole. At least he prevented the music from sounding overblown or
artificial.
No such defence could be made for Cesare Lievi's production. The setting was
updated to the time of composition - well, what production isn't nowadays? -
and ended up in a nowhere-land between the realistic and the metaphysical.
Luigi Perego's decor placed the action in a bare, white oblong room,
occasionally partitioned into identical halves sporting a phallic palm tree
 -apparently designed to show that the heavenly (Ariadne) and human
(Zerbinetta) are mirror-opposites with the same view of paradise. The
Comedians' japes were neither funny nor charming. With a false proscenium at
the front and back of the stage, the location of the court audience was
never clear. Strauss' and Hofmannsthal's marriage of opera seria and opera
buffa was made to look improbable and incongruous.
The cast deserved better. Edita Gruberova is still a show-stealing
Zerbinetta - on this occasion resembling a plump Sally Bowles with alluring
black fringe. Cornelia Kallisch's Composer, in stuffy grey suit and
wide-rimmed hat, showed spirit without charisma. Gabriela Benackova gave a
strong, static performance in the title role. Bacchus was Norbert Orth, a
Pedrillo-turned-Heldentenor. The supporting cast was good, particularly
Peter Keller's Dancing Master and Oliver Widmer's Harlequin. But - Gruberova
apart - the performance left me cold.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Battle of Dettingen, when the combined might of the German and English
armies led into battle by George II turned the course of the War of the
Austrian Succession, took place on 27 June 1743. Handel celebrated the
victory with his Dettingen Anthem, 'The King shall rejoice in thy strength,
O Lord' and the grandest of all his ceremonial pieces, the Dettingen Te
Deum. On Saturday in St James, Piccadilly, the Lufthansa Baroque Festival
marked the 250th anniversary with performances of both works, a roster of
British soloists and the St James Baroque Players joining forces with two
German choruses, the Volks-Chor Grosswelzheim and the male-voice Liederblue
Dettingen.
It was an appropriately grand, festive occasion, attended by Their Royal
Highnesses the Princess of Hesse and the Rhine (the Lufthansa Festival's
Patron) and the Prince of Wales. The conducting was shared between Ivor
Bolton and the Kapellmeister of the Volks-Chor, Franz-Peter Huber. It took a
while for the performances to bed down - an opening Purcell anthem, 'O Sing
Unto the Lord', conducted by Huber, seemed unsteady in rhythm and ensemble,
and the chorus just too large to negotiate nimbly the work's extrovert
complexities. But Handel's solo motet Silete venti was much more convincing,
with the soprano Lorna Anderson in dazzling form - splendid agility, easy,
gracious phrasing and tight, even trills.
The German choir always seemed a little on the ponderous side, with the
female voices distinctly more focused and responsive than the men; woolly,
weak tenors are evidently not just a characteristic of British choirs. The
odd exposed word apart, however (a strange 'Alleliu-jah' at one point, an
'Appossells' at another), Handel's English texts were convincingly
delivered.
The Te Deum was delivered by Bolton with bracing rhythmic attack and
forthright orchestral playing - excellent trumpets and woodwind - and deft
work from the soloists. Lorna Anderson was joined by Julia Gooding; and the
male trio of Christopher Robson, Martyn Hill and Michael George was
concentrated and intense at 'Thou sittest at the right hand of God'. It was,
however, the most imposing and theatrical moments that came off best, the
grandiose opening and the closing choruses: Handel at his most unabashedly
festive and populist.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Arts: A sigh of architectural relief - Colin Amery watches
an important public building rise on his doorstep
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not often that a mere critic has the opportunity to watch a world
masterpiece of contemporary architecture being built on his own doorstep.
The excitement for me of being on the very threshold of a great creative
endeavour has sometimes been almost too much to bear. Every day I have been
able to check discreetly on the progress of the work, being careful not to
create too much interest by my presence. Each day when it has rained or when
the frosts have seemed particularly hard I have secretly walked to the
corner of the street to check on the welfare of the growing baby.
But I should go back to the beginning. When in London I occupy a flat in
Notting Hill. It is a curious part of the world, not especially renowned for
its distinguished public buildings or great monuments. The purlieus of
Portobello are best known for antique shops, crumbling stucco terraces and a
permanent parade of colourful street life. There have been noble efforts by
local groups to enhance the neighbourhood - it is a conservation area and
one that has a certain lively edge to it. The sense of la vie boheme lived
out according to the ancient canons of the 1960s continues in Notting Hill .
. . I suppose it is the London equivalent of New York's Upper West Side.
At the junction of my street with the Westbourne Grove there was an
important public building until the 1980s. It was a much frequented place in
spite of being underground. The local authority - the Royal Borough of
Kensington and Chelsea - in their wisdom decided to fill in this underground
facility with concrete and erect a temporary structure for continuing public
use. However useful this temporary structure was, it was a visual disaster.
Its replacement was the cause of great excitement. Local worthies expected
an important example of local authority patronage and awaited the new
designs with bated breath. It is hard to convey the sense of disappointment
that these locals (grandly known as the Pembridge Association) felt when the
Council unveiled its mediocre design. But not being a group that winges and
does nothing, they were galvanised by a certain Mr Scott to do something to
avert the proposed horror. It was a stroke of genius to appoint architect Mr
Piers Gough to produce a replacement design.
Mr Gough is a brilliantly original architect. His firm was founded by four
partners who all trained together in the 1960s at the Architectural
Association in London. They have always designed houses, shops and
exhibitions but I think this work for the Royal Borough of Kensington and
Chelsea is their first major public building. In 1988 the practice,
Campbell, Zogolovitch, Wilkinson and Gough held an exhibition of their own
work at the Riba where they described themselves as 'English Extremists'.
It was hard to imagine what this exciting practice would produce for such a
key site in the Royal Borough. Like IM Pei confronted with the National
Gallery extension in Washington DC, Mr Gough was immediately struck by the
possibilities of a triangular island site. In fact Gough decided to
rearrange the car parking so that he could have a long and elegant triangle
as the site of his building. He ordered large and beautiful variegated trees
to be planted, beautiful public benches arrived from which the populace
could sit and admire the new building. An ancient monument in the form of a
drinking fountain was carefully restored to refresh the pilgrims who will
come from Tokyo and Texas to see the splendours of Kensington's newest
monument.
But what of the building itself? In plan it is a slender triangle. It rises
one floor to the elegant glazed canopy roof. The walls are clad in
remarkable glazed bricks in a distinctive shade of turquoise. Although this
is a public building there are no windows because the nature of the
activities conducted within demands a degree of privacy. Somehow this lack
of glazing does not matter as the silver doors etched with symbolic devices
catch the flashing light of the sun. Silver louvres allow the appropriate
degree of high level ventilation. The particular triumph is the roof, which
fans out like one of those remarkable Metro station entrances by Hector
Guimard in Paris. As in Paris, a flower seller will make a pitch here in a
sharply angled glazed kiosk that terminates the building to the east. There
is a large and handsome clock at the south west corner of the building which
is the generous gift of the local community association.
Another remarkable thing about this new addition to the splendours of
Kensington is the fact that unlike so many modern masterpieces it has not
been built for some elite clique of connoisseurs. No, it is available for
everyone to visit to pay their particular tribute to the architectural
muses. It will be a regular stopping place for taxi drivers, travellers and
itinerants of all kinds. Those seeking a momentary relief can with
confidence enter its high portals. London has gained a convenience of which
it can be proud. Your critic has a work of architecture on his doorstep that
he can truly say brings humour, elegance and utility to the most commonplace
of functions.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Arts: Tales from the Vienna Woods
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Enthusiasts for the plays of Odon von Horvath have a rare chance to catch
Tales from the Vienna Woods (1931) at the Courtyard, an attractive little
cabaret venue near King's Cross, London. Be warned that the performers, from
the Court Theatre Training Company, are students, who both overdo and
underdo things throughout. But the locale is ingeniously deployed, and a few
of the actors (notably those playing Marianne and her father) let you forget
that you are seeing student actors. And Horvath's play, which takes all the
romance of Vienna and punctures it point by point, is a vintage piece of
modernist theatre.
'The Comedians' Lyric Hammersmith, London, until July 24. 'Tales from the
Vienna Woods' The Courtyard, London N1, until July 9

FT  28 JUN 93 / Arts: The Comedians - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What a piece of virtuoso playwriting Trevor Griffiths's The Comedians is. It
is a comedy about comedy and comedians, an expose of different kinds of
funny men, and a serious play about the values that underlie comedy. Six
comics take evening classes in stand-up comedy from old comic Eddie Waters;
they do their acts, for an outside judge, before a northern working-men's
club audience; and afterwards they hear the results. Though this play dates
from 1975, and is about the Britain (the world) we all have known, it still
feels like a completely new type of play.
The six comics, each completely convincing, give us wholly different 'acts';
and the most masterly - the most truly witty - proves to be the least funny.
Sometimes The Comedians reminds me of the way that Shakespeare places a play
within a play, telling us about the nature of entertainment, revealing as
much about audience as players. But Griffiths's style, overtly addressing
moral and sociological issues, is plainly of our time. The fact that he
never turns didactic is a sign of his respect for the audience. This is
drama that makes sure you do think, but doesn't try telling you what to
think; Griffiths is a true artist.
Until well into the second half, you still are not sure what sort of play
this will turn out to be; it can put a laugh on your face, wipe it straight
off, shame you for having laughed in the first place. 'One of the virtues of
having a system of values,' said Virginia Woolf, 'is that you know exactly
what to laugh at.' Griffiths makes you question your values by questioning
your laughter.
This production, deriving from Leeds's excellent West Yorkshire Playhouse,
is directed by Jude Kelly - currently the Playhouse's artistic director and
formerly director of the National Theatre of Brent. Every switch of tone,
every nuance, makes its effect, and the casting is flawless. My only cavil
would be that a few patches in the classroom scenes are played too slow and
heavy, whereas more speed and lightness would make them more funny, more
natural and just as telling. A few of the pauses and crescendi in the final
scene, conceived for theatrical/expressive force, lack the truthfulness the
play is talking about.
As the most audacious of the student comics, Gethin, Tim McInnerny - so
versatile an actor - shows the killer instinct of the true virtuoso. Anyone
who has seen this actor will know that he has an exceptionally long neck (as
Sir Andrew Aguecheek with the RSC last year, he looked, with his long blond
wig, like Alice shooting up to a new height), and here that neck, turning
suddenly in mid-act, can have a brilliantly deadly effect. He makes Gethin's
rage, his alertness, his northern accent, his mime and verbal skills all
utterly real.
But this is an ensemble performance, and every role is beautifully played.
None is funnier than Willie Ross as the tired old club secretary. (His
toupee alone deserves a medal.) But he and all his colleagues show that
being funny is secondary to being honest. Here is a marvellous production of
one of the very finest plays of the last 20 years.

Lisa Hosking, who moved to CSFB from SG Warburg just a year ago as global
equity strategist, is leaving because her husband, a corporate financier at
Morgan Stanley, is being transferred to New York.
'I am leaving this job, but I do expect to have some involvement in the
future; we are still deciding what that might be' says Hosking.
At Warburg, she, with Andrew Garthwaite, was the top-rated international
equity strategist in the two most recent Extel surveys of investment
analysts; this year's survey appears on Thursday.
She has been in London for seven years. 'It is not perfect from CSFB's point
of view,' she admits. 'Returning to New York was always on the cards, but it
happened sooner than they (CSFB) had hoped.

Barbados-born Avinash Persaud, 27, one of the rising stars in the currency
forecasting world, is shifting from UBS to be head of currency strategy at J
P Morgan (Europe).
Persaud (pictured above), whose father is professor of sustainable
development at the University of the West Indies, was educated at the London
School of Economics and joined Phillips &amp; Drew as an assistant gilts
economist in 1988.
Two years later he transferred to the currency forecasting team and was
ranked third in the last Extel survey. At Morgan he will report to research
chief Norman Klath and Ron Levin will be his opposite number in New York.

<TEXT>
The Bangladeshi government has appointed ROUGHTON AND PARTNERS and LG
MOUCHEL &amp; PARTNERS to assist it with the rehabilitation of 300kms of cyclone
damaged roads in the Chittagong and Noakhali areas of Bangladesh.
The government has received a loan from the Asian Development Bank to
finance the rehabilitation of certain roads which were affected by cyclones.
The object of the rehabilitation is that the roads will provide improved
means of evacuation in the face of cyclone warnings, that they will be
reconstructed to resist cyclone damage and that they will be capable of
carrying relief traffic immediately after abnormal flood waters have receded
without sustaining damage.
The estimated value of this project is between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m.
Work is due to begin in October and will continue until the beginning of the
monsoon season in May 1994.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Construction Contracts: Children's entertainment park
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The P&amp;O company BOVIS INTERNATIONAL has won a Pounds 45m construction
management contract for the LEGO Park project on the site of the former
Windsor Safari Park in Berkshire for LEGO World A/S, the Danish family firm
which was founded 60 years ago.
Work will start on the development soon with completion due in December
1995. The LEGO park is scheduled to open to the public for Easter 1996,
subject to planning permission.
Situated on a 142 acre site, the park will cater for up to 1.2m visitors a
year and employ up to 600 staff. The leisure attractions are intended for
children rather than teenagers and adults, so the park will be small enough
not to be exhausting yet large enough to entertain children for a day-long
visit.
Designed in sympathy with the local Green Belt requirements and the adjacent
site of special interest, the park will feature five main activity areas
interspersed with landscaped walks and special water features.
In the centre of the park will be Miniland, an area where LEGO models set in
miniature landscapes will represent the towns, villages and famous landmarks
of many countries around the world.
The models, usually to 1:20 scale, will be enhanced with vehicles, figures
and sound effects representing state of the art animation technology.
Other areas include an Explorium (where children can build and programme
their own models), themed areas, indoor shows, ride-in cars, boat rides,
nature trails and lots of play tables where children can create their own
ideas from piles of bricks. Construction begins early in 1994.

FT  28 JUN 93 / People: RMC's successful German connection
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RMC, the building materials group which last year derived two thirds of its
operating profits from Germany, has promoted Stuart Walker, finance director
of the German subsidiary, to the main board. In his new position, he will
cover France, Spain and Portugal.
The largest producer of building materials in Germany, RMC has had a
presence in the country since 1954; apart from Walker and one other, the
operation is run entirely by German nationals. Bruno Baumgarten, boss of the
operation, already has a seat on the main board.
Walker, 49, has been closely involved with the expansion into east Germany,
including negotiations with the Treuhand, the agency charged with the
privatisation of east German industry. The company now has 70 ready mixed
concrete plants in the new states, making it one of the leading investors in
the east.
After 15 years living in Germany, Walker now returns to the UK. Meanwhile,
his new geographic beat, which he assumes from Peter Young, promoted to
managing director earlier this year, will already be somewhat familiar.
Walker had looked after Spain, Portugal and France for four years from 1978
when he first went over to Dusseldorf.
In 1992, turnover in Germany amounted to Pounds 1.3bn compared with Pounds
378m in France and Pounds 133m in Spain.

FT  28 JUN 93 / People: Blue Circle recast prompts departure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hugh Beevor, 49, chief executive of Blue Circle Overseas, has resigned from
the board of Blue Circle Industries following a decision to split the
building materials group into just two principal operating divisions instead
of five.
Keith Orrell-Jones, who took over as group managing director last October,
says that reorganising the company into two main divisions - Home Products
(HP) and Heavy Building Materials (HBM) - will 'provide greater management
focus and further reduce costs'.
However, the reorganisation has precipitated the departure of Beevor, one of
the group's most experienced executives. As boss of Blue Circle Overseas he
had been in charge of the most profitable parts of the overseas cement
interests.
Orrell-Jones refused to elaborate on the reasons for Beevor's departure but
analysts speculated that it probably had something to do with the
reshuffling of responsibilities of Blue Circle's six main board executive
directors.
Blue Circle Overseas and Blue Circle Enterprises (BCE), which takes in the
group's property interests, are being merged into HBM, which takes in all
the traditional cement interests.
Under the reorganisation, Tony Jackson, 59, chief executive of BCE, takes
responsibility for Africa; David Lovett, 50, president of Blue Circle
America, adds South America and marine cement to his portfolio; and Ian
McKenzie, 55, chief executive of Blue Circle Cement, has been given all of
Europe, waste management and Ockley brick.
The responsibilities of Charles Young, who oversees home products, or
roughly half Blue Circle's business, remain unchanged. But finance director
James Loudon adds the property portfolio to his office.
Orrell-Jones says that the overall co-ordination of HBM will be undertaken
by himself for the time being but he does not rule out the possibility of
appointing someone to do the job at a later stage.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Management: How to spot the talent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies must try harder to attract, develop, and retain their 'gold
collar' workers, according to a new study*.
Superior ability to manage talent provides a significant and sustainable
competitive advantage, argue its authors Philip Sadler and Keith Milmer of
Ashridge Management College. Drawing on case studies from organisations
across seven countries, the report presents a strategy for getting the best
out of people. For example, companies are advised to:
Provide a common sense of purpose or direction and a set of shared beliefs
and values. Top managers want more from their organisations than pay,
security and a chance to develop their skills. Companies commended in this
respect include Merck, Glaxo Group Research, ICL and Rockwell.
Develop an appropriate organisational framework. Care must be taken not to
stifle creative people, while at the same time ensuring management control.
Understand your culture. Cohesive work teams, elites without elitism,
openness and trust, and encouragement of innovation and risk-taking will be
features of a talent-nurturing culture.
Identify long-term requirements for high-talent personnel. The report
suggests too many companies adopt a short-term, financially driven approach.
Motorola, though, gets top marks for its 'strategic' vision. Develop
recruitment and selection strategies. Some companies in the study betrayed
'a relative lack of sophistication' but National Westminster Bank stood out
in its use of full-scale assessment centre procedures at the recruiting
stage.
Manage for performance. Ensure that talented people know what is expected of
them in terms of output, and involve them in setting their own performance
standards. Do not take motivation for granted.
Evaluate your talent. For an organisation employing large numbers of
talented people the authors say the opinion survey is an indispensable tool.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Management: The battle of Warsaw - Michael Skapinker visits
the Hotel Bristol, which has fought to turn local companies into good
suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Michael Goerdt arrived at his new Warsaw office two years ago, he asked
his secretary to buy 10 files. She returned with the local shop's entire
stock of three.
He contacted the Polish file manufacturer directly and ordered 300. It would
take time, the company said. The order represented a full week's production.
While waiting, Goerdt painted his office - a Portakabin in the grounds of
the Hotel Bristol.
Once Warsaw's grandest hotel, the Bristol was a crumbling hulk when Goerdt
arrived from Forte Germany to be its general manager. Last April, the hotel,
complete with new marble bathrooms, glass lifts and a basement swimming
pool, was formally reopened by Baroness Thatcher.
Forte, the UK company that runs the hotel, markets the Bristol as part of
its Exclusive Portfolio, which includes the Grosvenor House in London, the
Plaza Athenee in New York and the George V in Paris. After its meticulous
refurbishment under Forte's supervision, the 92-year-old Bristol can hold
its head up in such company.
Forte owns 55 per cent of the hotel, with the remainder held by Orbis, the
Polish tourist agency. Forte's stake came cheap; it only put up Pounds 4m of
the Pounds 25m spent on the refurbishment, with the rest coming from the
International Finance Corporation and other funding agencies.
The drawback to investing in an exclusive hotel in eastern Europe is the
constant struggle to find reliable builders, staff and suppliers in
countries unused to the demands of a market economy.
These difficulties were explored on this page in an article about the Moscow
Aerostar Hotel, a joint venture between the airline Aeroflot and IMP, a
Canadian company (December 7 1992). While managers at the Aerostar and the
Bristol tell some of the same stories, running hotels in Poland and Russia
are substantially different experiences.
Both hotels have a large number of university graduates on the staff, taking
calls at the reception desk, making beds and serving in restaurants. In
Warsaw, as in Moscow, international hotel employees earn far more than
doctors or teachers. Both hotels encountered problems training staff, who
grew up under the communist system.
Ingrid Eras, the Bristol's Dutch-born personnel manager, recounts how
difficult it was to get passing staff to pick up a ringing telephone if the
telephonist was away from the desk. In both hotels, however, managers said
their employees' long experience of formal education made them quick
learners.
As islands of affluence in the former communist world, both hotels have
suffered from staff theft. The Bristol's bath plugs have been a favoured
target. All Bristol employees, from managers down, have to pass a traffic
light, installed at the staff exit, on their way home. When the light turns
red, the employee leaving at the time is searched. Eras says the overall
level of theft has been far less than feared.
Staff at both hotels appear more attentive and enthusiastic than their
counterparts in western Europe. They have all mastered the art of being
pleasant to guests, even if - as one Bristol employee notes - not all
western guests have mastered the art of being pleasant to staff.
The difference between Warsaw and Moscow is that foreign investors say they
find Warsaw a more hospitable business environment, although not everyone
will feel that way. My own welcome was dented by a taunt of 'Zyd]' (Jew)
from a passer-by in a street near the Bristol.
The Bristol has had far more success than the Moscow Aerostar in finding
competent local suppliers. The Aerostar made some efforts to buy wine, fruit
and other products locally but ended up importing all its food, drink,
cleaning materials and office equipment. Local suppliers did not have the
experience or capital to provide the quality and reliability needed.
Hans Gemmer, Forte's central European vice-president, says the Bristol has
to import beef and seafood. But the company has managed to buy vegetables in
Poland. To be on the safe side the hotel simply puts 'vegetables' on the
menu, rather than promising a specific item.
Gemmer says the Bristol's food store has to carry up to 3 1/2 times as much
food as a west European hotel. Toiletry inventories are 10 times as high as
in the west. He says, however, that Polish suppliers' ability to deliver has
improved enormously over the past two years.
Goerdt persuaded some companies to move into new businesses specifically to
supply the hotel. He found a Polish farmer with excess supplies of
strawberries and cherries, bought him bottles and sugar and taught him how
to make jam.
He discovered the hotel would have to put down a Dollars 1m deposit for a
licence to import wine. Instead, he persuaded a Polish trading company to go
into the wine importing business. The arrangement has worked well, except
that the company is only prepared to import in bulk. This means that,
instead of replenishing stocks as they are consumed, the Bristol has to use
up most of its available wine before ordering more. Guests sometimes have to
be told some wines are not available.
The hotel's greatest success was getting all the bedroom furniture made in
Poland. Olga Polizzi, Forte's building and design managing director, says
the group gave a sample bedside table to 10 companies and asked them to
manufacture one. A Warsaw company, PKZ, came up with a better table than the
British, Italian and German companies.
The PKZ factory looked chaotic, but Clare Knapp-Fisher, Forte's design
director, says her instincts told her the company would cope. 'They were
very straight. They were very honest about their own misgivings about being
able to fulfil the contract.' The company made all the bedroom furniture to
Forte's satisfaction.
Polizzi and Knapp-Fisher say they now realise they could have used Polish
sub-contractors more than they did. The reconstruction of Warsaw's old town
and palaces has left the city with a substantial group of skilled craftsmen.
Despite the improvements of the past few years, Polish companies still have
to learn to market themselves. To Forte's surprise, PKZ has not followed up
its success by asking to do more work for the group.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Management: Coping with double trouble - How foreign
postings can affect dual-income couples
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brooke is a dance therapist. Until recently she had a thriving practice in
New York teaching people how to reduce their stress levels through dance.
Then her husband, a high-flyer with an international oil company was offered
a posting in London. For him it meant promotion, more money, excitement. For
her it meant closing down her business, losing income and status.
Despite the unpromising beginning, the story has a happy ending: Brooke is
now enthusiastically teaching dance therapy to an unaccustomed British
audience. But most 'dual-career' couples are not so lucky. If they move, one
suffers, if they do not, the other does. And in either case employers may
lose out because their best people are refusing to move or because the
'trailing spouse' is so unhappy that the posting is a failure.
Companies are increasingly recognising the problem. According to recent
research, 65 per cent of big employers say the careers of the spouse are a
problem in international staff transfers, and 90 per cent of companies
expect them to become one in the future. Of foreign assignments that fail, a
third are due to problems relating to the spouse's job - or lack of one -
abroad. Yet despite this concern, only 35 per cent of companies do anything
to help the trailing spouse.
These figures were presented last week at a seminar on dual careers,
organised by Employment Conditions Abroad, a non-profit making body that
advises companies on international relocations.
The problem is not just for wives. Increasingly, it is the husband that
trails. Career Relocations, a specialist company that helps find jobs for
the spouse, reports that 5-10 per cent of its clients are male and that the
proportion is rising. Indeed, the fact that some men are now sloping
unhappily around the world after their wives may be partly responsible for
the new seriousness with which senior management is taking the issue.
Most companies have no policies to compensate for loss of the spouse's
income as they fear it would be too expensive, especially as the trailing
spouse may earn more than the employee. Neither are they prepared to do much
to help the spouse find a job. Many will offer language training and perhaps
provide some information about conditions in the foreign job market, but the
help stops there.
Many of the big international employers that attended last week's seminar,
which was co-sponsored by career consultants GHN, admitted that they made up
the rules as they went along. However, some forward-thinking policies are
starting to emerge when both parties work for the same organisation. Then,
companies try to find jobs for both together, or at least promise a leave of
absence and maintained benefits to the spouse.
Matters are more complex when the spouse works somewhere else. Some
employers said they would in certain circumstances get together with the
spouse's employer to see if he or she could be posted to the same place,
with both companies perhaps dividing the relocation costs between them.
Alternatively, the employer might offer the spouse a job themselves, or try
to find one through informal networks or relocation companies.
Many companies are starting to interview both employee and spouse before
deciding upon an international assignment. One big retail company said that
if the wife seemed unhappy about it they would think very carefully about
giving the husband the job, no matter how suitable he was.
The lessons that emerged from last week's seminar were that all sides - the
company, employee and spouse - should make their positions clear to each
other from the outset.
If companies set a high value on on international experience - and 80 per
cent of multinational companies do so, according to a recent survey  - then
it is best if they let the employees know it from the start. Equally,
employees should work out in advance with their spouse whether and in which
cases they are prepared to travel.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Economics: Focus on US data and German rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attention this week will be divided between the US, where economic
statistics are expected to reinforce the picture of weak economic recovery,
and the European continent, where pressure on Germany to cut interest rates
will build up ahead of Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting.
These events could harden attitudes among the world's seven leading
industrial countries before meeting in Tokyo next week for this year's G7
economic summit.
In the US, Thursday's National Association of Purchasing Managers' index is
expected to point to stagnation in the industrial economy. While consumer
confidence is expected to have recovered somewhat in June, Friday's
important labour market data for the past month will offer little comfort to
the administration.
Pressure on the Bundesbank to ease policy has proved counterproductive in
the past and German inflation data this week is unlikely to encourage rate
cuts.
After Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, ruled out lowering British
borrowing costs last week, interest in the UK will focus on the new
leadership at the Bank of England.
The main economic statistics and events of the week follow. In brackets are
the median of economists' forecasts, from MMS International, a financial
information company.
Today: Japan, May retail sales (down 3.7 per cent on year). Germany,
Bavarian cost of living in June (up 0.2 per cent on month). Canada, April
earnings from employment (up 2.4 per cent on year).
Tomorrow: US, May leading indicators (down 0.2 per cent), new home sales
(685,000), export prices, import prices; June consumer confidence (63).
Japan, May industrial production (down seasonally adjusted 2 per cent),
unemployment rate.
Wednesday: US, June Chicago NAPM; May factory orders (down 0.7 per cent),
inventories. France, May unemployment. Japan, May housing starts (up 3 per
cent on year), construction starts, construction orders. Canada, April real
GDP (up 0.1 per cent). Australia, May current account (ADollars 1.2bn
deficit), building approvals.
Thursday: Belgium assumes EC presidency. UK, Eddie George takes over as Bank
of England governor; cyclical indicators. Germany, Bundesbank council meets
in Leipzig, two-day hearing on constitutionality of the Maastricht Treaty
starts before German Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe. US, June NAPM
(51.2); May construction spending); jobless claims for week to June 26
(348,000); money supply for week to June 21 (M2 down Dollars 2bn). France,
OECD publishes half yearly Economic Outlook.
Friday: UK, June official reserves (up Pounds 60m). US, June non-farm
payrolls (up 150,000), manufacturing payrolls (unchanged), unemployment rate
(6.9 per cent), hourly earnings (up 0.2 per cent), average workweek, June
final Michigan sentiment indicator.
During the week: Germany, March trade balance (DM1.7bn surplus), current
account (DM4bn deficit); May import prices (up 0.1 per cent on month, down
3.2 per cent on year), industrial production (flat on month), manufacturing
output (flat); June preliminary cost of living (up 0.2 per cent on month,
4.2 per cent on year). Japan, May IMF standard current account and trade
balance. Spain, April industrial production (down 3.7 per cent on year).
Belgium, June consumer prices (up 2.6 per cent on year), unemployment (12.2
per cent). Finland, May unemployment (17.5 per cent). Italy, May M2 (up 6
per cent on year), bank lending (up 5.3 per cent); June consumer prices.

FT  28 JUN 93 / The Week Ahead: City looks for confident payout from GEC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RESULTS DUE
Most of the attention on GEC's results on Wednesday will centre on how
generous the lumbering giant will be with the dividend. The City was
disappointed with the cautious 5 per cent rise at the half-way stage;
optimists are looking for a 7 per cent advance in the second half of the
year.
Taxable profits are expected to be around the Pounds 860m mark for the year
to March and the cash mountain is expected to measure up at about Pounds
2bn, just more than Pounds 1bn from the company itself and the remainder
from joint ventures.
Most of GEC's main lines - telecommunications, power systems and medical
systems are performing well. GEC may have had its share of criticism in the
1980s but analysts now take the view that its sober practices give it the
feel of a company for the 1990s.
ASDA, the UK grocery retailing chain, is expected to announce on Friday an
improved full-year profit of between Pounds 135m and Pounds 142m. That would
be a significant increase on last year's Pounds 86.8m before exceptional
write-offs of Pounds 451.6m, and in excess of the company's own forecast of
Pounds 130m given in January when it launched a Pounds 347m rights issue to
accelerate its recovery programme.
Analysts believe chief executive Mr Archie Norman's strategy of a return to
keener pricing and the 'Asda price' promise, and a shake-up of
merchandising, buying and marketing, is bearing fruit. They also believe
Asda has continued to see like-for-like sales running about 2 per cent ahead
of the last financial year. A final dividend of 1.1p is forecast, giving a
total of 1.6p, down from 2.1p last year.
Airtours, the holiday company, announces half-year results today with losses
before exceptionals expected to be Pounds 7.5m, compared with Pounds 5.6m
last time. Holiday companies usually make a first-half loss as they are
already paying some of their summer season costs. A further exceptional loss
of Pounds 9.5m is likely, resulting from the failed bid for Owners Abroad
earlier this year.
The company will be pressed on its plans for the Hogg Robinson travel agency
chain it has just acquired. Observers will also be looking for any
confirmation that the group is purchasing Aspro, a smaller tour operator.
Airtours will also be asked about summer prospects and the recently
announced inquiry into the industry by the Office of Fair Trading.
Pre-tax profits of BPB Industries, Europe's biggest plasterboard producer,
are forecast to have risen to Pounds 48m-Pounds 55m for the year to the end
of March when it publishes its annual results on Thursday. This follows the
ending last year of a European plasterboard price war between BPB, Lafarge
Coppee of France and Knauf of Germany.
The market will want to hear what BPB has to say about whether recent price
rises announced in the UK are sticking given the fragile nature of the
recovery in the UK construction market.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Clash of the cans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ecotop, an all-steel fizzy drinks can with a novel push-button opening
system, is launched today, Neil Buckley writes. J. Sainsbury, the food
retailer, is the first UK company to use the can, developed by British Steel
Tinplate, Hoogovens of the Netherlands, and Germany's Rasselstein. It has
chosen it as packaging for Gio, a new own-brand lemon and lime drink. To
open the cans, consumers press two buttons - a smaller one to release the
pressure inside the can, then a larger one to reveal a hole for pouring. The
launch marks a new phase in the battle for supremacy between steel and
aluminium. Aluminium has come to dominate the beverage market since the
introduction of the ring-pull can in 1963.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways has beaten Air France in the refurbishment of their
supersonic aircraft, Concorde.
The first of British Airways' seven Concordes emerged during the weekend
with a complete interior refit. Work on the last should finish next spring.
The investment of about Pounds 1m per aircraft was prompted by passengers
who complained of Concorde's dated image. The aircraft have been in service
since 1976.
Air France is also in the midst of improving its five Concordes. Details
should be revealed by early autumn.

FT  28 JUN 93 / City's anti-IRA plan is opposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS are hostile to plans to restrict access to parts of the City of
London in an effort to prevent further terrorist bombings, Paul Abrahams
writes.
The plans, proposed by the Corporation of London - the local authority for
the City - would probably require legislation and government support to
reach the statute book.
The scheme, announced in outline earlier this month, involves banning
non-essential traffic from about a third of the City. The boundaries would
be likely to include only the heart of the City.
The area would be divided into five zones. Each would have an access through
a single entrance staffed by guards.
The proposals follow two IRA bombs in the past 14 months that killed four
people and caused hundreds of millions of pounds of damage.
Whitehall officials say ministers are concerned that the plans would be an
admission of success for the IRA if they were to go beyond sensible policing
measures.
The Corporation has received some support for the scheme during meetings
with 400 City businesses. Most supported the plan, although some expressed
concern about access for service vehicles.
The Corporation insisted yesterday that nothing firm was yet on the table
and that the scheme was unlikely to be implemented soon.

FT  28 JUN 93 / National Express turns skywards for expansion: An unlikely
bid to run an airport has some logic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COACH operator National Express knows little about airports but a good deal
about passengers. So when it emerged this week as the favoured bidder for
East Midlands International Airport, likely to take it over next month or in
August, the group made clear there would be no managerial bloodletting.
Mr Ray McEnhill, National Express chief executive, said the airport has a
strong team. 'It will continue to manage the airport with our commercial
overview,' he said.
This is practical magnanimity. The airport management was a rival bidder for
control of the airport when the local authority owners - Derbyshire,
Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Nottingham City - decided to sell it.
The other bidders were Regional Airports, a UK private company, and the
airport operations subsidiary of Lockheed, the US aerospace group. National
Express was the only contender without airport experience. Whether there is
a correlation between that and the size of its bid is not clear.
Yet National Express was the only contender with coaches daily trundling off
the M1, south-west of Nottingham, carrying passengers to the airport at
Castle Donington. In that fact, from the group's point of view, lies the
sense behind what looks at first an unlikely bid.
During the year to last March East Midlands Airport handled 1.26m
passengers, mostly on charter flights. Most of these were inclusive tour
passengers, described by Mr McEnhill as mainly in the 'C' and 'D' income
brackets. 'That represents our custo-mer base too,' he noted.
The fastest growing sector of the coach market is taking people to and from
airports. One of National Express's first tasks is to find ways of
increasing its coach traffic into the airport and increasing the airport
traffic on to the coaches.
East Midlands is a good place to try; it has no rail link. It is an airport
for vehicles. It offers the opportunity of trying to extract more revenue
from the mature coach market.
The airport is a revenue stream in its own right, with operating profits in
the year to March 1992 of Pounds 2.5m. When the figures for March this year
are published they will probably show a profits rise of about 15 per cent.
With only restricted possibilities of growth in the coach market, this is
the sort of diversification National Express needs if it is to provide
returns for shareholders it obtained by its market flotation last December.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Global link set up to issue information
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN electronic World Press Centre designed to link organisations issuing
information with journalists all over the world has been created with
venture-capital backing.
The London-based computer centre, which is already operational, has the
support of organisations such as the World Bank and Unesco.
Governments, international agencies, businesses and pressure groups will
send their press information electronically to the London centre, and it can
be read electronically anywhere by journalists.
Unlike normal day-to-day storage, information in the World Press Centre is
organised in a series of electronic pigeonholes. Journalists interested in
climactic change, international trade or health, for instance, can simply
dip into the relevant pigeonhole to see whether there have been any releases
on their subject.
Press releases can be made available instantly all over the world to
journalists, normally at local telephone call rates. There will be also be
multi-language versions.
Former journalist Mr Peter Thompson, founder of the centre and who trained
as an economist, has been working on the system for eight years.
He believes he is well on the way to beating the 'chicken and egg' problem -
information providers using the system only when they are confident that
newspapers and broadcasters are also using it.
Lord Grenfell, chief of external affairs at the European office of the World
Bank, said: 'Our feeling is that we now have a system into which we can feed
a great deal of information of interest to the end users and indeed we are
now feeding in such material on a regular basis.'
Mr Rod Fenwick, a senior marketing executive at Atex, the supplier of
computerised newsroom systems, said the company is investigating the
possibility of adding the World Press Centre software to its systems as
added value.
In the developed world the operation will be a profit-making venture but the
developing world will be charged at cost. Subscriptions will be about Pounds
10 per week for each individual using the centre.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Names seek change in Lloyd's survival plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REBEL NAMES are pressing for radical changes to the Lloyd's business plan in
an attempt to offer a solution to the legal actions overhanging the
insurance market.
Mr David Springbett, a founder of reinsurance broker PWS, has developed a
series of amendments to the Lloyd's plan and is spearheading efforts to
persuade Names to support his scheme. The plan, announced in April, involves
cutting costs and agency fees and opening the Lloyd's insurance market to
incorporated as well as individual Names.
The plan has been criticised for failing to help Names facing immense calls
on their assets after recent losses on the market. Last week Lloyd's
reported record losses of Pounds 2.9bn for the 1990 year.
'We've made it clear that in terms of detailed implementation our business
plan is not sacrosanct,' Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, said on
Friday. However, he stressed that Lloyd's was competing for capital. It
would not get any if it 'priced itself out of the market'.
The latest draft of the Springbett scheme says that its initiative,
described as 'constructive' by Lloyd's, is needed because loss-making Names
'will fight longer and harder - and more effectively than Lloyd's currently
appreciates - to prevent Lloyd's collecting more funds from them'. However,
proposals to charge all future investors a total of up to Pounds 500m a year
for membership of Lloyd's are certain to be resisted by the market's council
 -its governing body.
The Springbett proposal is to transfer billions of pounds in the market's
current assets and liabilities to a new insurance company which would be
owned by Names - the individuals whose assets support underwriting at
Lloyd's - and operate from Bermuda, which has a liberal tax and regulatory
regime.
The new company, known as Lysold, would handle payment of all claims on
policies underwritten before 1991 and settle outstanding litigation with
Names. Lloyd's would in effect start afresh next year, backed by corporate
capital and existing Names who wish to continue underwriting at the market.
Lloyd's would pay Lysold an annual royalty of between Pounds 250m and Pounds
500m, with the money helping to fund some of the market's heavy recent
losses and paving the way for an out-of-court settlement of litigation
between Names and their agents.
Lysold would declare an immediate 18-month moratorium on writs and drawdowns
for those unable to pay, and Names would be asked to settle only 40 per cent
of all present known losses.
Names still unable to meet their obligations would be offered more generous
arrangements from the market's hardship committee, which would be renamed a
members' ways and means committee.
Lysold would also attempt to reduce liabilities by reassessing outstanding
claims and the methods used to settle them, and would also itself become an
investor in Lloyd's.
However Mr Middleton said that many potential corporate investors already
felt that the entry fee being demanded by Lloyd's - an annual fee initially
set at 1.5 per cent of premium limit - was too onerous. 'This sort of thing
is decided by market forces,' Mr Middleton said.
Lloyd's could be more receptive to other elements of the plan, however,
especially to proposed modifications of the business plan's proposals to
'ring-fence' long-tail liabilities that emerge many years after the original
policies were underwritten.
The Lloyd's business plan proposed creation of a company into which all
liabilities on policies underwritten before 1986 would be transferred, but
Mr Middleton is not ruling out the possibility of that year being brought
forward.
Work on the centralisation of all information on old policies, which is due
to begin this week, would be an important first step in any event, Mr
Middleton said.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Pressure grows on ITV over news slot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL opposition to the ITV companies' plans to move News at Ten to the
early evening is likely to increase this week.
The government has made clear its displeasure over the proposed move and has
warned that it may refuse to allow any latitude over the future ownership of
television news organisations.
Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act 51 per cent of ITN has to move to non-ITV
ownership by the end of 1994. Following the ITN reorganisation earlier this
year which brought in Reuters as a shareholder, the remaining ITV owners
thought the government could be persuaded to change its mind.
They hoped that bringing in another outside shareholder, such as a US
network, would be seen as an acceptable level of outside investment and that
the ITV shareholders - Carlton, Central, London Weekend, Granada, Scottish
and Anglia - would be allowed to retain control.
It is now being made clear by Downing Street that if News at Ten disappears,
and with it the platform it often gives the Commons for historic votes live
on air between 10pm and 10.30pm, the letter of the Broadcasting Act on ITN
ownership would be enforced.
ITV wants to move News at Ten to 6.30pm or 7pm because its present slot
interrupts films and drama beginning after the 9pm 'adult' watershed and
because of what it sees as increasing competition from Channel 4.
The Broadcasting Act took away the power of the Independent Television
Commission to set specific time slots for programmes although the ITC plans
to do everything it can to block the move.
Some people in ITV would also like to remove the ITN brand name from its
bulletins on ITV and just give it a credit at the end like any other
programme supplier.

FT  28 JUN 93 / How a simple ruse cost the public purse Pounds 92m: The
biggest fraud case to be prosecuted by the tax authorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE corporation tax fraud carried out by Nissan UK, the highly successful
car importer set up by Mr Octav Botnar, was by far the largest ever
prosecuted by the Inland Revenue.
It lasted some nine years until June 1991, when the Revenue acted on a
tip-off and raided the company's Worthing headquarters in West Sussex. By
then it had cost the public purse some Pounds 92m in lost corporation tax
and interest. Its scale puts it among the largest frauds to take place in
the UK.
That the fraud lasted so long is explained by its relative simplicity - and
its cross-border nature which enabled the scheme to be concealed from tax
authorities in Britain and elsewhere.
The tax evasion began in 1982 when Nissan UK had transformed the position in
the UK car market of the imported Japanese car from standing joke to leading
player.
Mr Botnar ran his company in notoriously autocratic style, establishing a
reputation for the ruthless hiring and firing of executives. Renowned for
his aggressive manner, he maintained a low public profile, only displaying
his considerable wealth through large charitable donations.
Mr Hunt, who had known Mr Botnar since the mid 1960s, served as his loyal
number two throughout. An inconspicuous character, Mr Hunt's invested his
considerable income from Nissan UK in a widespread portfolio of UK and
foreign investments. His only apparent ostentation was a cinema Wurlitzer
organ installed in his West Sussex home which, at the press of a button,
would rise through the living room floor.
Mr Frank Shannon, the finance director who also served on the board of
Brighton and Hove Albion Football Club, was number three on the team until
he resigned in 1986.
The Revenue claimed this trio, who ran the company and owned its entire
share capital, were all involved in the fraud with Mr Botnar apparently its
prime mover.
It was not the first time the revenue had investigated Nissan UK. The
company's unusual arrangements for shipping cars from Japan had first
provoked the curiousity of tax inspectors in 1984. Explanations given then
did not leave them completely convinced, but were enough to prevent further
investigations.
Second time around, the Revenue was more suspicious that a big fraud had
taken place. Further digging led to the decision to mount the largest-ever
raid on a company's offices.
In a dawn swoop on June 26 1991, 135 revenue investigators and police
officers raided 13 locations. They included the offices of some of Nissan
UK's financial and legal advisers and the homes of Mr Botnar, Mr Hunt and Mr
Shannon.
Mr Botnar himself was caught in his dressing gown when a dozen Revenue
officers arrived at his house at 7am. He was furious. Having recently lost
the franchise with Nissan, he was on the brink of concluding a similar
importing deal with another leading motor manufacturer. This never happened.
Although it was clear from the outset that the fraud centred on inflated
freight charges and was very large, the real scale of it did not become
apparent until after the Japanese end had been investigated in November
1991. Only then did it become clear how great was the difference between the
charges actually paid by the Japanese and those claimed by Nissan UK.
The fraud uncovered by the Revenue was essentially very simple. Nissan
Japan's transport division, Nissan Motor Car Carrier (NMCC), had originally
provided all aspects of the service to ship the cars to the UK. Nissan UK
renegotiated this arrangement, employing intermediary shipping agents.
Scansiris, the Norwegian agents run by Mr Tore Thorsen, another alleged
conspirator, were used after 1982 to submit sham invoices for services which
had, in reality, continued to be provided by NMCC.
In this way Nissan UK could artificially boost its freight charges declared
to the Revenue by some 40 per cent, thus avoiding substantial sums in
corporation tax.
Scansiris would invoice Nissan UK for the inflated freight charges, aided by
Mr Frederick Pannosch, an Austrian rail consultant, who, in a bogus
arrangement with the Norwegian company, claimed to have carried out services
performed in reality by NMCC.
Nissan UK would pay Scansiris the inflated rates. The Norwegian company then
paid NMCC the genuine rates and the surplus was routed into Mr Pannosch's
account at BFG bank in Basle. However, Mr Pannosch had no control over this
account. Exactly what happened to the money after it was deposited in the
account remains unknown.
The banking arrangements at BFG were carried out by a Mr Kurt Vogelsang who
is also named on the indictment as a co-conspirator - a charge he dismisses
as 'ridiculous'.
Mr Pannosch proved a valuable source of information, handing over records
which contained considerable detail of the correspondence between himself
and Mr Thorsen.
His co-operation with the Revenue ensured that, although named as a
par-ticipant in the fraud, he was not prosecuted and appeared instead as a
central witness for the prosecution.
The Revenue's version of the fraud was challenged in court by Mr Hunt's
lawyers who, while openly admitting that a fraud had taken place, tried to
shift responsibility for it away from Worthing to the Japanese at Nissan's
Tokyo headquarters. However, there was no direct evidence to support these
claims, the trial judge said.
Whatever the success of the investigation, the prosecution suffered a series
of setbacks over gaps in extradition arrangements for alleged tax offences.
These remain so great that it is virtually impossible to extradite anyone
accused of tax offences from even the friendliest of European countries.
This has benefited both Mr Botnar and Mr Thorsen. Mr Botnar was in
Switzerland at the time of the arrests of Mr Hunt and Mr Shannon. Although a
warrant has been issued for his arrest, he has remained out of reach of the
British authorities.
Mr Thorsen was arrested and was due to stand trial but later simply flew
home to Norway. In a letter to the trial judge, headed 'Operation Viking',
he announced he was 'tired' of the Revenue's prosecution. 'I have decided
not to partake in this case any more,' he said.
The trial which ended on Saturday in effect marks the end of the criminal
actions over the fraud. However, a series of lengthy civil actions is now
set to follow as the Revenue attempts to recover as much of the missing
Pounds 92m as possible.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Revenue to sue Nissan UK director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Inland Revenue is to start civil proceedings to recover as much as
possible of the Pounds 92m lost in the largest tax fraud in British history.
The move follows the conviction on Saturday of Mr Michael Hunt, the managing
director of Nissan UK, the West Sussex-based former car importers. He was
found guilty on one count of conspiring to defraud the Revenue of Pounds 56m
corporation tax.
Mr Hunt was convicted with a 10-2 majority by an Old Bailey jury. He was
acquitted on a similar charge involving a further Pounds 41m.
The Revenue will now start proceedings to recover as much as possible of the
money from Mr Hunt. Mr Richard Walters, the Revenue lawyer who brought the
case, commented: 'Mr Hunt is facing a large tax bill'.
He will be sentenced on Wednesday along with Mr Frank Shannon, the company's
former finance director who had previously admitted one count of cheating
the Revenue.
Mr Justice Gatehouse, the trial judge, refused a Revenue request for an
order to confiscate Mr Hunt's assets immediately. Mr Hunt, the prosecution
said, had personally benefited by about Pounds 30m from the fraud. However,
a Mareva injunction to freeze his assets was granted. The trial had heard
that between December 1982 and December 1991, freight charges for importing
Nissan cars from Japan were artificially inflated by some 40 per cent. A
total of Pounds 149m was siphoned out of Nissan UK through a Norwegian
shipping agent before being laundered into a Swiss bank account. Unpaid
corporation tax on this money amounted to Pounds 56m. When interest over the
period is added, the total lost by the Revenue exceeds Pounds 92m.
Mr Hunt and Mr Shannon are the only people to be prosecuted over the fraud
which, the Revenue claims, involved several others. Mr Octav Botnar, the
company's chairman, was said to be the prime mover, but has remained in
Switzerland, safe from extradition.
Mr Hunt was allowed to return home on bail until Wednesday.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Success story ends in exile and bitterness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NISSAN UK fraud trial has been Lear without the king. Across the water
in Switzerland the main actor in the drama, Mr Octav Botnar, has remained
beyond the reach of British justice.
The warrant issued for his arrest in January last year by the Inland Revenue
has never been served. At the time Mr Botnar was abroad, and in the
subsequent 18 months he has shown little enthusiasm for leaving his chalet
in the mountains above Geneva to return to the country in which he made his
fortune.
He has since become embroiled in the furore over Conservative party funding,
with reports that he contributed up to Pounds 1m through off-shore accounts
to Tory funds in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
Mr Botnar's story is one of the more extraordinary in the annals of modern
British business. In his late 50s, at an age when many would be
contemplating retirement, he took over the exclusive franchise for importing
and distributing Nissan vehicles in the UK.
In the course of the next 21 years he built businesses with an annual
turnover of about Pounds 1.5bn and annual pre-tax profits close to Pounds
150m. Now it has been revealed that even these hefty profits were
fraudulently understated. Mr Botnar built a web of trusts obscuring the
ultimate ownership of his operations in entities registered in Panama and
the Bahamas which are still exciting Revenue interest.
For nearly two decades it appeared that his business could do little wrong.
Nissan's share of UK new car sales grew until it was capturing 6 per cent of
the market and was far and away the leading Japanese car franchise in the
UK.
By the early 1990s, however, the magic had begun to fade. Without knowing
it, the skids had already been put under Nissan UK, even as it was
celebrating one of its proudest moments. In December 1990 Mr Botnar invited
guests, friends and media to London's Savoy Hotel for a rare public
appearance to celebrate Nissan UK's 21st birthday.
Mr Cecil Parkinson - then a very recent ex-transport secretary - rose to
describe Mr Botnar as 'truthfully one of our great philanthropists'. Nissan
UK had revealed that morning that it was donating Pounds 8m to the Great
Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children.
What Mr Botnar did not realise then was that Japan's second-largest carmaker
had decided a week before to end Nissan UK's lucrative exclusive import
franchise. The decision was made public at the end of December 1990. Nissan
Motor said that 'the basis of trust essential to a trading relationship was
no longer present between the two companies'.
Ever since, Mr Botnar has been at bay. He has fought to outwit the forces
closing in on him with a vigour and determination that belie his 79 years
and a recent history of serious heart disease. Yet he has been forced to
remain in exile from the UK, an increasingly embittered old man, fighting
the Revenue and other legal battles but with only mount-ing frustration to
show for it.
Mr Botnar remains in complete and idiosyncratic control by telephone of the
part of his empire that survived the termination of the Nissan franchise,
namely the sister company Automotive Financial Group Holdings. This is one
of the UK's largest multifranchise retail motor groups.
He has often raged against Nissan Motor managers, who he has always claimed
were responsible for tipping off the Revenue about him.
Mr Botnar, now at home recovering from major surgery, was characteristically
unavailable for comment yesterday.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Spending review takes low profile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMPACT of the fund-amental review of next year's public spending is
expected to be limited to a scrutiny of forgotten corners of departmental
budgets. It is unlikely to extend to radical proposals.
The news is likely to dismay Tory rightwingers who have already expressed
concern that the overall total of Pounds 253.6bn approved by the cabinet for
next year's public spending is too high. Some have called for more drastic
restructuring of departmental budgets instead of possible tax increases to
tackle the scale of public borrowing.
Whatever the long-term savings, ministers are unlikely to favour for next
year those deeper changes - such as encouraging people to 'opt out' of
entitlement to some welfare benefits - which carry immediate costs.
Instead, officials suggest that the focus will be on low-profile areas of
expenditure. Even so, individual spending programmes will still face cuts so
that the overall Pounds 253.6bn total for next year can be met.
Progress reports from the four departments in the first tranche of the
fundamental spending review - the Home Office, the Department for Education,
the Department of Social Security and the Department of Health - are due to
be sent to the Treasury by the end of next month.
The first 'pathfinding' meeting of EDX, the cabinet committee on public
expenditure which is chaired by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is
pencilled in for the week beginning July 12.
Mr Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief secretary, hopes to complete his
round of bilateral discussions with spending ministers over the next five
weeks. He has already begun a series of meetings with Tory backbenchers to
impress upon them the difficulty of decisions in the current spending round.
Last year, the first EDX meeting was not until the second half of September,
but this year a full programme of meetings is planned throughout September.
The timetable for work on public spending has been brought sharply forward
by the pressure on the Treasury of combining the tax and spending statements
in the unified Budget in November.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Treasury 'wise man' calls for skills cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASED public spending on training, scientific research and
infrastructure such as roads and railways may be needed to boost long-term
industrial competitiveness, Professor David Currie, one of the Treasury's
team of outside economic advisers, warns today.
In linking higher public spending in specified areas with the requirements
of business, Prof Currie is joining forces with others on the seven-strong
advisory team which is meeting today at the Treasury to complete its first
report to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.
In a study written jointly with Mr Geoffrey Dicks, a colleague at the London
Business School, Prof Currie suggests that to reduce the Pounds 50bn
government deficit Mr Clarke should consider cuts in tax relief on mortgages
and cuts in income-tax allowances.
Tax increases should on the whole be favoured to reductions in public
spending, which can be 'indiscriminate, cutting into areas of spending that
are important for promoting longer-term growth'.
In his comments on public spending, Prof Currie is joining forces with two
other of the 'seven wise men' - Mr Andrew Britton and Mr Gavyn Davies - who
also reckon a more-skilled labour force and improved public investment are
essential to stable growth.
Others among the advisers are keener on across-the-board public spending
cuts as a way to control state borrowing. Their report will be presented to
Mr Clarke later this week before its public release next Monday.
Writing in the latest edition of the LBS's Economic Outlook, Prof Currie and
Mr Dicks also swipe at Prof Tim Congdon, another of the Treasury's wise men.
They say broad money in the past has 'not been a reliable indicator',
commenting: 'Advocacy of this indicator is accompanied by exaggerated claims
for Tim Congdon's forecasting prowess that does not bear close examination.'
Because of skill shortages and lack of mobility, efforts to reduce
unemployment below 2.5m by an expansion of demand are likely to trigger
higher wages and unacceptable inflation, the LBS economists say.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Major intervenes over market-testing delays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR WILLIAM Waldegrave, the public service minister, has called in Mr John
Major to speed up the much-vaunted programme of bringing private-sector
competition to government activities.
Mr Waldegrave has been unable alone to push the initiative for-ward, and has
been forced to call on the prime minister to remind departments of the
initiative's importance.
Mr Major will give fresh impetus to the market-testing initiative by telling
Whitehall departments which have slipped severely behind schedule that they
must treat it as a priority. Up to a dozen departments are expected to
receive the Downing Street order to make better progress. They include the
Home Office, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of Trade and
Industry.
News of Mr Major's intervention came as Labour highlighted embarrassing
delays in the programme for market testing.
Ms Majorie Mowlam, Labour's public service spokeswoman, said government
information showed that four mainstream departments had failed to complete a
single market-testing exercise since November. The four departments - the
DTI, the Department for Education, the Scottish Office and the Department of
Transport - are due to have completed market-testing more than Pounds 130m
of Civil Service activities by the end of September.
Concern that this year's programme has fallen so far behind schedule has
raised questions over its extension. Mr Waldegrave has been planning to
extend competition in an ambitious range of areas from the late autumn.
Contracts already put out to tender include some core Whitehall work such as
the Treasury's economic forecasting and data collection as well as support
work including information technology consultancy, and legal and estate
management services.
Some senior civil servants are said to claim responsibility for delaying
progress in contracting-out, but the most serious factor is confusion over
the impact of regulations designed to protect the rights of workers in
takeovers and mergers.
The Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) 1981 regulations
guarantee the jobs and pay of the existing workforce in many cases when work
is contracted out. As the regulations implement the European Community
Acquired Rights Directive they cannot be removed by UK legislation.
In a letter leaked earlier this year, Mr Michael Bichard, the chief
executive of the Benefits Agency, complained that the Cabinet Office had
failed to answer key questions over the issue.
There has also been some criticism from within Downing Street that Sir Peter
Levene, head of the efficiency unit, has not dealt with the difficulty more
decisively.
Ms Mowlam said that the stalling of the programme amounted to a 'de facto
moratorium caused by departmental confusion and uncertainty, and William
Waldegrave's lack of political clout'.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Severe pay restraint is urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FULL employment in a competitive non-inflationary economy will require
severe wage restraint, says Professor James Meade, a close colleague of
Keynes in the 1930s and one of the authors of the 1944 White Paper on
employment policy.
Prof Meade, writing in a pamphlet for the Employment Policy Institute, says
that last year, with some 3m unemployed and unemployment rising, money
earnings per head rose 6 per cent although the cost of living rose only 3
per cent.
He proposes measures to limit the power of trade unions and other groups of
workers who can prevent the entry into work of unemployed outsiders at lower
wages than the already employed insiders.
He also suggests compulsory arbitration for setting bargained rates of pay,
with the arbiters obliged to accept the rate proposed by either party which
would most expand the volume of employment.
Prof Meade accepts that the consequence of those and other suggestions might
be a reduction in wages and a sharp shift to profit. 'Such distributional
effects would be inequitable and morally and politically unacceptable unless
they were offset by some other form of income which supplemented low rates
of pay,' he says. He therefore advocates a more equal distribution of wealth
and a 'citizen's income' paid to every citizen whether employed or not.
East Anglia, Wales, the east Midlands, and the Yorkshire and Humberside area
will be the main regions to benefit from the expected recovery in terms of
rising employment, says Mr David Kern, chief economist at National
Westminster Bank.
In forecasts released today Mr Kern says 200,000 jobs throughout the UK will
be created by the end of next year.

MANUAL workers, white-collar staff and employees in the retail industry have
won pay rises of three times the rate of inflation, Incomes Date Services,
the pay analyst, has found.
Two thirds of recent pay rises have been between 2 per cent and 3.9 per cent
compared with 1.3 per cent inflation. One in seven rises has been more than
4 per cent.

EMPLOYERS are continuing to discriminate against older executives in
recruiting, says a study of 400 redundant executives by Drake Beam Morin,
the recruitment consultancy.
On average, those aged under 35 gained positions within four months, the
35-to-40 group took six months and the 40-to-50 group eight months.

TOO MANY businesses demand 'outrageous time commitments' from employees, Mr
Alistair Burt, junior social security minister, told the Scottish Tory
Reform Group at the weekend.
In a wide-ranging speech on social policy he said the demands were made
'without thought of the damage to family structure or for the strength
employees should get from a sound family life if they are allowed to foster
it'.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Tory MP attacks clearing banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE main clearing banks are a 'menace to their staff, their customers, their
shareholders and the national economy' and should be broken up to provide
finance for industry on a more intelligent basis, says Mr Alan Duncan, a
Tory MP, Peter Marsh writes.
In a paper for Demos, the independent research group, Mr Duncan, MP for
Rutland and Melton, says the banks were responsible for much of the
'disastrous' boom and bust of the 1980s. But they 'appear to have learned
nothing' from this experience.
The banks are 'alienating' many of the small businesses on which much of the
expected UK recovery depends by 'increased lending spreads, reduced
overdraft facilities, higher transaction charges and demands for additional
security as asset values decline'.
Mr Duncan thinks banks would assess lending risks more intelligently if they
were 'unbundled' into smaller regional units which were less bureaucratic
and closer to their customers.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Managers 'ignorant' of training schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST senior managers are ignorant about the relevance to their organisations
of the government's main training initiatives, a survey published today
claims.
Managers needed evidence that initiatives such as National Vocational
Qualifications would deliver positive results, according to the joint survey
of 542 managers, all at board level or equivalent, compiled by the Institute
of Management and employment services company Manpower.
Only a third of managers believed that NVQs would significantly alter their
employees' attitudes towards training.
The government has just launched a big advertising campaign for Investors in
People, a standard that assesses how far a company's training meets its
business needs, but companies are still sceptical of what the standard can
do for their profits.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Transatlantic prices are an ocean apart / A look at why many
items cost less in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FEW BRITISH visitors return from the US without wondering why
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
even after sterling's devaluation last autumn - so many things cost less
over there than at home.
Late last year McKinsey, the international management consultancy, set out
to answer the question by analysing the main factors which determine retail
prices on either side of the Atlantic.
Armed with a shopping list of 268 similar products, McKinsey compared prices
at outlets in the London and Chicago areas. It found that on average prices
were 31.7 per cent higher after tax in Britain than in the US.
The difference was calculated when the pound was worth Dollars 1.60, and
would be nearer 22 per cent at today's exchange rate. Even so, some
individual examples remain striking. Frozen chickens cost four times more
per pound in Britain than in the US, while some DIY items were three times
dearer.
About 50 products were cheaper in the UK. Many of these were British or
other European brands, such as Laura Ashley, Body Shop, Benetton and Jaeger.
But Heinz baked beans, of which Britain is traditionally world champion
consumer, also cost 35 per cent less than in the US, where Heinz has its
headquarters.
An analysis of retailers' cost structures identified four main reasons why
prices were often higher in Britain than in the US - although their relative
importance varied widely between products. The four factors are tax,
property costs, productivity and trade prices.
Britain's 17.5 per cent value added tax, charged on most products except
food, baby clothes and a few other items, is more than double the 7.25 per
cent sales tax in the Chicago area.
The study found tax accounted for half of the 24 per cent difference in the
price of a pair of cotton briefs and for more than a third of the 29 per
cent difference in the price of a Walkman compact disc player.
However, tax was responsible for as little as one sixth of the price
differentials for doughnuts, ice-cream and hamburgers sold in fast-food
outlets. Yet these were found to cost between 48 per cent and 112 per cent
more in Britain than in the US.
Prime retail selling space cost only a third as much in the US as in
Britain. That was one of the main reasons for the higher UK prices of fast
food and clothing and was particularly important for department stores.
However, it accounted for a smaller proportion of the price differentials on
electrical and DIY goods. Dearer space costs explained only a quarter of the
63 per cent difference in the retail price of a standard 16ft ladder.
On average, retailers' productivity was 23 per cent higher in the US than in
Britain, reflecting lower wage costs and higher sales per employee. US
stores generally were more advanced in their use of automation, although in
many sectors sales per square foot of store space were comparable with the
UK.
Profitability varied widely across sectors, but was often higher at the
level of the individual store in the US than in Britain. The main exception
was grocery retailing, where UK supermarkets had higher returns on sales and
capital than US chains, as well as bigger sales per square foot and per
employee.
However, the study says these advantages would not be large enough to
safeguard UK supermarkets' profitability if their prices fell to US levels.
If that happened, they would show an average 20 per cent negative return on
capital, compared with a recent average 27 per cent positive return.
The prices at which US retailers purchased many products were found to be
lower than in Britain. The study found particularly big differences in DIY
products, electrical goods and food.
The Common Agricultural Policy helps to hold up the price of food in the UK.
The ingredients for one mass-market line of grocery products cost 37 per
cent more in Britain than in the US, where manufacturing costs were also
lower. Together, these two factors contributed to a UK trade price 23 per
cent higher than in the US.
McKinsey also believes that the prices of some products, such as camcorders,
home computers and software for video games, are higher in Britain because a
less mature market has enabled manufacturers to earn fatter profit margins.
Other reasons for transatlantic price differentials are American consumers'
traditionally greater emphasis on price and comparative shopping, and the
greater diversity of retail outlets in the US, where the industry is less
concentrated than in Britain.
The study found prices of the same products varied much more widely around
Chicago than London but McKinsey says that when comparing UK and US prices
it was careful to ensure that the types of store surveyed in each country
were similar.
Some reasons for transatlantic price differentials, such as tax levels and
the cost of prime retail space, are deep-rooted and unlikely to change
quickly.
However, the study argues that Britain will be increasingly influenced by
competitive trends from across the Atlantic, notably the growth of discount
stores and greater price sensitivity among consumers.
That could require big adjustments by established chains.
The study says: 'UK retailers will have to bring their costs and
productivity more into line with those of their US counterparts to avoid a
sharp decline in profitability.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT is costing the National Health Service more than Pounds 70m a
year, says a report published today by the Office Of Health Economics, a
research body funded by the pharmaceutical industry. The cost to
general-practitioner and pharmaceutical services is put at Pounds 40.1m and
the loss in revenue to the NHS in prescription charges at Pounds 30.6m. The
report says unemployment leads to illness through a combination of stress,
poverty and unhealthy living.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Trusts lift fund managers' profitability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE profitability of Britain's investment management houses reached a
five-year high last year despite rising competition, says a a survey of fund
managers.
The survey of 38 managers with a total of more than Pounds 400bn in assets
was conducted by Price Waterhouse Management Consultants. Profitability
expressed as a percentage of revenue was an average of 18.1 per cent before
tax across the industry. This reflected efficiency gains and an increase in
funds committed to management.
However, the survey found wide variations in the profitability of different
products. Personal equity plans, a staple product of retail financial
services firms, produced on average losses for firms offering them equal to
14.9 per cent of their income.
Price Waterhouse suggests that the relatively small size of individual Pep
accounts mean they may never be profitable. In key respects they resemble
products offered to private clients whose average account is nearly 10 times
that of the average Pep. 'Providing a private-client level of service to Pep
investors cannot be profitable,' Price Waterhouse said.
The most profitable product category for the industry is the investment
trust, which produced an average profit of 42 per cent of revenue, followed
by pension funds and charities which produced returns of 24 per cent. Pooled
insurance funds produced returns of 19 per cent. The study found that
insurance companies in particular have been slow to adapt the cost structure
of their fund management operations. They are characterised by antiquated
computer systems and high general administration costs.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Donations row bemuses Hong Kong tycoons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAIN reaction in Hong Kong to the news in Britain about business
donations to the Conservative party has been one of bemusement.
This stems from two factors. First, the sums involved are, by the colony's
standards, trivial. The other factor stems from its status; Hong Kong is a
British colony and most of its population are British subjects.
Mr Li Ka-Shing's alleged Pounds 100,000 donation to the Tory party pales
into insignificance when compared with the Pounds 17m he has donated to
build a university in his home town of Shantou, on the south China coast.
Many of Hong Kong's leading businessmen, including Mr Li, are British
citizens, or, like Mr TT Tsui - who numbers Mr Michael Heseltine, Mr Norman
Lamont and Mr David Mellor among his friends - holders of British Dependent
Territories passports.
The late YK Pao, who used to play bridge with Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's
senior leader, was an unquestioning fan of Lady Thatcher, and was given a
knighthood.
Being Chinese is not, even in these days, wholly synonymous with being
anti-British, says Mr David Tang, an Anglophile businessman with impeccable
mainland connections.
'There are many of us who have made a lot of money in Hong Kong and believe
that this has not been unconnected with the stable government the UK has
afforded us,' he explains. 'That's why I give money to the Conservative
party.'
Mr Tang also points out that most of the money flowing to the Tories from
Hong Kong Chinese businessmen results from their observance of 'face'. If a
friend asks for money the natural reaction is to give it, he says. 'My
grandfather gave Pounds 100,000 to the RAF museum at Hendon. Now, he would
not have known what a Spitfire looked like if he fell over one. But Sir Jack
Cater (former Hong Kong chief secretary) asked him for a donation because he
had a friend who ran the museum. So he gave.'
What gives some piquancy to the issue is the extent to which many of the
Tory party's former donors have deserted the cause. Even before Governor
Chris Patten's arrival a year ago many of the colony's leading lights were
moving closer to Beijing.
This is no better illus-trated than by Mr Li and Mr Tsui. The former is
assiduously cultivating top mainland connections and Mr Tsui has recently
started an investment company which marries Hong Kong money with Beijing's
leading government ministries.

OPPOSITION to a call by President Ibrahim Babangida for a fresh presidential
election mounted yesterday amid continuing confusion about Nigeria's
political direction.
Gen Babangida on Saturday confirmed the annulment of the June 12 poll and
ordered a rerun, while promising to keep to the scheduled handover to
civilian rule on August 27.
According to new conditions he laid down, both Mr Moshood Abiola, leader of
the Social Democratic party (SDP) and winner of the aborted poll, and his
rival, Mr Bashir Tofa of the National Republican Convention (NRC), would be
ineligible to stand. He said presidential candidates have to have been
members of their party for at a least a year - which disqualifies Mr Abiola
 -and over 50, which rules out Mr Tofa, who is 45.
Moroccan opposition groups made strong gains at the expense of the five
centrist parties in the first phase of parliamentary elections, Reuter
reports from Rabat. However, no party won an outright victory.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Revival of illusory hope of 'going for growth'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
OVER THE last 20 years the balance of opinion on macroeconomic policy in the
UK has shifted, with the state of the cycle and the latest experience, from
naive Keynesian, to monetarist, to international monetarist (shown in
support for membership of the ERM) and, it increasingly seems, back to naive
Keynesianism. No other country seems as giddy, not even the US.
The great puzzle about this debate is that there is so little reason to
suppose it matters. Macroeconomic policy works by expanding nominal demand
and, thereby, nominal gross domestic product. But the evidence strongly
confirms one of the best established propositions in economics, namely, the
neutrality of money. The growth of nominal demand has no identifiable
relationship to the growth of real output in the longer term.
The chart summarises the experience of the main OECD countries over the past
20 years. It shows that there are countries with low growth of nominal GDP
and modest growth of real GDP, such as Switzerland, Germany and the
Netherlands. There are countries with high growth of nominal GDP and high
growth of real GDP, such as Italy and Spain. Japan had modest growth of
nominal GDP, but exceptionally rapid growth of real GDP. Meanwhile, the UK
would have enjoyed a growth miracle, if rapid growth of nominal GDP were
sufficient to create one: the growth of UK nominal GDP was the third
highest, but the growth of its real GDP the third lowest.
One conclusion is the obvious one that growth is determined not by
macroeconomic tinkering, but by savings and investment and, as eastern
European experience shows, by the efficiency with which resources are used.
A second conclusion is equally obvious. If the chancellor of the exchequer
should succumb, for electoral reasons, to the temptation of 'going for
growth', cheered on by commentators who should know better, he will generate
a short-term boom followed by another slump. Such policies would not raise
long-term economic growth. They would merely reduce Mr Kenneth Clarke's
reputation ex post to the level of Lord Barber's.
A third conclusion goes in the opposite direction. Low inflation is
certainly not, as the Bundesbank seems sometimes to suggest, a sufficient
condition for rapid economic growth. It may well not even be a necessary
condition for such growth. The most important argument against inflation is
ethical. Inflation is taxation by stealth, a fraud on the body politic. It
should be banned as surely as any similar malfeasance - stealing from
pensions funds, for example, which it closely resembles.
Inflationists always have new arguments. The argument of the moment is that
it would be impossible to restart inflation even if governments were to do
their best, or rather their worst. In the short to medium term, this
argument is perfectly plausible. This is not because of the intensity of
global competition, which might have a once-and-for-all effect on the level
of prices, but not on the longer-term trend. The sounder argument is that it
is difficult to start inflation in a modern economy without expanded bank
lending as well. But the commercial banks of the industrial countries are,
for the present, either unable or unwilling to lend much more. The main and
rather startling exception is in Germany.
It may be difficult to start inflation without co-operation from banks, but
it is not impossible. If pundits think UK inflation is dead, even though it
is still 3-4 per cent a year, they should advise the government to finance
its entire deficit by borrowing from the Bank of England. If he were to do
so, Mr Clarke could save about Pounds 4bn a year in interest payments on his
Pounds 50bn in projected annual borrowing. The reason nobody in fact
recommends more than a limited amount of underfunding is not far to seek.
People are not so foolish that they believe their own propaganda. Additional
cash of Pounds 50bn a year would soon lead to a roaring inflation. Inflation
is not dead. It is merely resting. There is no good reason, bar short-term
electoral convenience, to wake it up once more.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Kantor will need tact and firepower in Tokyo: Time is
running out for pact on Japan-US trade, according to Michiyo Nakamoto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative, is known to be a fighter as well
as 'a man who can bring people together in a crisis', according to an
official profile. These qualities will be drawn upon this week.
The US and Japan are committed to agree a broad framework for bilateral
trade and economic issues before the second meeting between President Bill
Clinton and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa on July 5. Officials from both
sides locked horns in negotiation yesterday, the second set of meetings this
month.
In spite of recent signs of some moderation on the US side, the two
countries remain wide apart on a number of issues and the chances for such a
framework to be agreed in the time left look increasingly slim.
The most problematic remains the US insistence that benchmarks should be set
to measure progress in opening Japan's markets to imports and reducing its
trade surplus.
The US is urging Japan to reduce its current account surplus from 3 per cent
of GNP (it is expected to reach Dollars 150bn this year) to between 1 and 2
per cent of GNP within three years.
US pressure on Japan to set measurable results has raised the temperature in
Tokyo as has Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's trade commissioner, who last week
backed the US demand for Japan to cut its trade surplus.
A young Japanese television reporter reflected the antagonism felt towards
US insistence on targets in a question put to Mr Kantor when he visited
Tokyo last week: 'Would it be acceptable to you,' the reporter asked, 'if
Japan or any other country sets targets for reducing the US budget deficit
and threatens to retaliate against you?'
The question is moot, since the US budget deficit, and the need for US
citizens to save more and consume less, have also been identified as
important contributors to international trade tensions.
The Japanese argue that measuring results is unrealistic since Japan is a
free-market economy in which the government can do little to influence the
course of trade.
'Will the US tell its consumers not to buy so much foreign goods?' asks a
Foreign Ministry official close to the bilateral talks. 'Just as it cannot
do that, so we cannot influence our economic activity to that extent.'
The problem with this argument is that for many in the US it lacks
credibility, since there is widespread evidence in Japan of an unusually
high level of government management of the economy:
'There isn't a grain of rice in Japan that isn't managed,' says one US
businessman with extensive experience in Tokyo.
The recent history of US-Japan trade relations suggests that foreign
pressure - called 'gaiatsu' in Japanese - and the setting of targets do
produce results.
In the US-Japan semiconductor agreement, a 20 per cent market share for
foreign makers was achieved after a concerted effort by trade officials, and
private Japanese and US companies alike, despite Japanese insistence that
they were never committed to attaining that goal.
In the auto parts industry, Japanese authorities have rejected US assertions
that Japan promised to buy Dollars 19bn worth of US auto parts by 1994. But
as the US increased the pressure, Japanese car makers have been stepping up
their procurement of US-made auto parts.
Japanese officials protest that trade should not be managed in that way but
left to market forces. Other trading partners protest that as Japan has
bowed to US pressure, so trade has been diverted at their cost.
But many foreigners doing business in Tokyo see a strong need for government
intervention to overcome ingrained business practices which tend to favour
domestic producers: 'In Japan, there are very close links between companies
that do business together,' says Mr Yoshikazu Hori, president of Cray
Research Japan, the supercomputer company.
Cray received orders from private Japanese companies after government
pressure was applied.
The Japanese authorities also accept that more needs to be done to improve
transparency in the country's market and open the country further to
imports. They would prefer to do so in a constructive manner, without the
threat of retaliation. Discussions would be a two-way process and disputes
would be put before multilateral forums such as the Gatt.
So far, Japan has colonised the moral high ground by insisting that any
proposals with a whiff of managed trade are unacceptable. In this, they will
win the support of other trading partners, and most serious trade
economists. But if they are determined to resist US demands for measurable
results on the grounds that Japan is a free market economy, the country's
bureaucrats will have to do much more than say so.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Cairns warning on farm reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SUBSTANTIAL liberalisation of international farm trade must be 'a central
and essential part' of a successful Uruguay Round deal, ministers from
leading farm exporting countries said in Bangkok yesterday at the end of a
two-day meeting of the Cairns Group.
'We will not be put in a position of being sidelined,' warned Mr Peter Cook,
Australia's trade minister: 'The Uruguay Round will not be a done deal until
all countries sign on.' He and two other Cairns ministers flew to Tokyo to
present their 'Bangkok declaration' to Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa before
next week's summit of the Group of Seven industrial nations.
It is hoped the G7 will be able to agree on liberalisation of trade in
manufactures and services, allowing long-stalled negotiations on the Uruguay
Round to resume in Geneva among all 111 contracting parties to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Cairns ministers warned that if the G7 meeting failed to make the necessary
breakthrough, the Uruguay Round 'could be jeopardised simply because of lack
of time'.
For the past two years, progress in the Uruguay Round has been stalled as
the US and EC wrangled over farm trade reform. Since the bilateral agreement
at Blair House in Washington last November, talks have broadened, with the
US, the EC, Japan and Canada seeking a big package of tariff cuts across
manufactured goods and services. They have hoped this package could be used
to jump-start the Uruguay Round negotiations.
Recent momentum in these four-way market access talks almost stalled last
week in Tokyo when ministers failed to agree a package to be presented to
the G7 summit. They have called a special ministerial meeting in Tokyo for
July 6 - on the eve of the G7.
The 14-member Cairns group, which includes countries as diverse as Hungary,
Argentina, Thailand and Australia, yesterday called on the G7 to improve
market access for their farm exports, severely disrupted by protection in
the US and the EC.
Farm exports from the group have stagnated at under Dollars 62bn (Pounds
41bn) since 1989, with their share of world farm trade falling from 20.3 per
cent in 1989 to 18.7 per cent in 1991.
The group warned that the US and the EC would need to improve the terms of
the Blair House agreement. 'Access must be maintained on terms at least
equivalent to those existing.'

FT  28 JUN 93 / Mauritania loses special trade status
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US has stripped Mauritania of special trade status and threatened to do
the same for eight other nations, including Indonesia and Thailand, if they
do not improve workers' rights.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said 'specific action plans'
had been developed to improve worker rights in El Salvador, Guatemala,
Indonesia, Thailand, Malawi and Oman. 'If countries fail to make substantial
concrete progress in address worker rights concerns during (the next six
months), their GSP benefits will be in serious jeopardy,' he said.
He gave Indonesia eight months to bring its labour norms into line with
'international norms'.
The generalised system of preferences (GSP) is a tariff-free programme
designed to help the developing countries gain markets in the US, and it has
often been used as an important trade policy tool.
Mr Kantor's announcement was hailed by human rights activists.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Parties take aim at LDP: Five Japanese opposition groups
form electoral pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE leaders of five main non-communist opposition parties in Japan agreed
yesterday to maximise co-operation in the general election on July 18 with
the aim of defeating the Liberal Democratic party, which has been in power
since 1955.
The meeting of opposition parties, called by Mr Tsutomu Hata, leader of a
44-strong breakaway from the LDP, agreed to negotiate an electoral pact to
avoid their candidates splitting the anti-LDP vote.
The parties attending the meeting at a central Tokyo hotel were Mr Hata's
Shinseito, a conservative party formed last week, the Social Democratic
party, which is the largest opposition party, the Komeito clean government
party, the Democratic Socialist party and the small United Social Democratic
party.
The Japan New party, another new conservative party formed last year which
is becoming popular in urban areas, refused to attend because it said it did
not want to be associated with former members of the LDP.
The party leaders said they aimed to form a coalition government to reform
Japan's political system. However they shelved debate over controversial
foreign policy issues which divide them, such as their approach to Japan's
security alliance with the US.
Mr Hata's group of former LDP members includes strong supporters of US
policy and of Japan playing a larger role in United Nations peacekeeping
operations. But the Social Democratic party is opposed to both the
relationship with the US and the dispatch of Japanese troops abroad.
The opposition parties attempted to allay concerns about their differences
and the socialist influence within a coalition by saying they would maintain
the LDP's basic foreign and diplomatic policies.
The opposition meeting comes amid growing signs that Japanese business
leaders, including the Keidanren, the powerful federation of economic
organisations, will consider funding Mr Hata's party after the election.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Japan rejects targets on domestic market access
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY Japanese acceptance of numerical targets on access to its domestic
market would automatically lead to managed trade and increase government
interference in the economy, a senior Japanese official warned yesterday.
Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, outgoing vice-minister for international affairs at
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, made his comments as US
and Japanese negotiators gathered for talks on a framework for subsequent
discussions on issues such as government procurement and competition.
The US is pressing Japan to adopt economic policies to cut its current
account surplus from about 3.5 per cent of gross national product to about
1.5 per cent and to accept targets to measure its progress in opening its
market to imports.
Mr Hatakeyama said Japan had the lowest tariffs on imported industrial goods
of any major economy, and added: 'If the US wants to increase imports of
industrial goods swiftly, that can only be achieved by the Japanese
government asking people to purchase what they do not want to buy.'
It was Japan's view that any numerical targets to measure import penetration
would be inevitably be used to put pressure upon the government to intervene
in the market.
Mr Lawrence Summers, the US Treasury undersecretary for international
affairs, denied the US was seeking managed trade. Speaking in Tokyo on
Friday, he said the US wanted to open up highly regulated areas of the
Japanese economy as part of a programme for Japan to 'normalise its economic
relations with the rest of the world'.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Ruding is favourite to take over at EBRD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DR Onno Ruding, the former Dutch finance minister, has emerged as the
leading candidate to replace Mr Jacques Attali as president of the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
However, French foreign minister Alain Juppe said yesterday that Paris
wanted to keep the presidency of the bank French. 'I will undertake to
recall that France has a sort of moral credit on this presidency,' he said.
'Since the choice was made that the EBRD should be based in London with a
French person at its head, I think this choice should be respected, beyond
the departure of Mr Attali,' he told RTL radio.
The timing of any decision on who to appoint is uncertain, because the 56
governments and agencies which own the bank were caught off guard on Friday
when Mr Attali announced his intention to resign as soon as a successor is
found. 'There is a consensus that Mr Attali must be replaced quickly,'
commented a bank director. 'Although he remains at the bank, it is
impossible for him to do his job properly since everyone knows he is going.'
But the director added that choosing a permanent successor should not be
done in a rush. 'A number of us feel that someone should be appointed
temporarily to the job, while decisions are taken on a permanent replacement
and also on the structure of the bank's management.'
Bank directors are touting three individuals as interim presidents: Mr Mario
Sarcinelli, the Italian vice-president in charge of development banking, Mr
Ron Freeman, the first vice-president in charge of merchant banking, and Mr
Claes de Neergaard, Sweden's representative on the board of directors and
chairman of the audit committee.
Directors said that candidates to replace Mr Attali permanently were led by
Dr Ruding, currently working for the US bank Citicorp, and also include Mr
Henning Christopherson, the EC commissioner, Mr Jacques de Larosiere,
governor of the Banque de France, Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, head of the French
Treasury, and Mr Karl-Otto Pohl, former president of the German Bundesbank.
'Ruding is the only one who seems to command broad support among the G7
governments,' said an official from one of the G7 leading industrial
countries.
Ms Anne Wibble, the Swedish finance minister and chairman of the bank's
governors, has said she will meet her vice chairmen as soon as possible to
discuss how to replace Mr Attali. The bank's governors are expected to offer
Mr Attali a year's salary - Pounds 149,000 after tax - for loss of office.
The bank's directors today hold a board meeting, which is likely to approve
the bank's first Bulgarian loan. The replacement of Mr Attali is not on the
formal agenda.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Law and order party draws police support: Ariane Genillard
goes to the Republican congress in Augsburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUTSIDE, eight Bavarian policemen forced a demonstrator to the ground at the
weekend in front of the hall in which Germany's far-right Republican party
held its annual congress. Inside, 591 party delegates, many of them police
themselves, were fine-tuning the programme with which the Republicans will
project themselves as the law and order party in next year's federal and
state elections.
With street violence and the number of foreigners in the country on the
rise, the Republicans say the electorate is ripe for their patriotic,
be-tough argument.
And, with scandals marring the image of Germany's mainstream parties, they
hope to tap into a rich vein of protest votes.
But their trump card, according to Mr Franz Schonhuber, the populist party
leader, will be to speak out to the large part of the German population
which stands against Maastricht and fears a common currency.
Mr Schonhuber claims the Republican party, which represents a legitimate
nationalist force to the right of Germany's alliance between Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Bavarian-based
Christian Social Union (CSU), will gain 10 per cent of the national vote
next year.
After poor results in the 1990 national elections, where it attracted the
support of 2.1 per cent of the electorate, the party gained ground in state
elections by securing 10.9 per cent in the Baden-Wurttemberg parliament last
year and by winning nearly 8 per cent in local elections in Hesse in the
spring.
But the Republicans claim the worsening domestic situation will now allow
them to win seats in the federal parliament.
In a long litany to the congress in Augsburg Mr Rudolf Seuffert, party
leader for Bavaria and formerly active in the CSU, pointed to the growing
number of asylum seekers in Germany and the billions of D-Marks spent to
cover their living costs.
His colleague, Mr Georg Wischnat, a civil servant from Hamburg and a former
supporter of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), says the party will
stand for 'the small people' and denounce 'the growing corruption in public
life'.
'We must do something because both in Europe and in our own country, Germans
are being sold down the river,' adds Mr Hubertus Vierhaller, an export
company manager who used to support the CDU, as he leans against a table on
which party organisers display tapes of German patriotic songs.
But above all, anti-foreigner arguments pervade the party's populist
rhetoric. The programme calls, for example, for the nationality of criminals
to be disclosed, for asylum seekers to be put in camps until their cases are
judged, and for German families to enjoy special rights when seeking
accommodation.
'We Germans have to find ourselves again,' says Mr Schonhuber, a former
Waffen SS member, who is calling on his fellow men to overcome their
post-second world war sense of guilt. 'Otherwise, we will have lost the war
only today.'

FT  28 JUN 93 / NIB chief Lindbaek to lead World Bank arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank today will announce the appointment of Mr Jannik Lindbaek,
head of the Nordic Investment Bank, to lead its private sector development
arm, the international Finance Corporation, from January 1 1994.
Mr Lindbaek will succeed Sir William Ryrie, who has overseen an
extraordinary growth in the IFC's lending and resources since taking on the
leadership in 1984. Sir William will retire 'to do other things' from the
IFC in December.
The Helsinki-based NIB, owned by Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and
Sweden, finances projects on commercial terms within the Nordic regions and
in 15 developing countries. Like the IFC, it borrows on the international
capital markets with a triple AAA credit rating.
Mr Lewis Preston, World Bank president, praised Mr Lindbaek's 'record of
accomplishment in both the private and public sectors'. Before moving to the
NIB in 1986, Mr Lindbaek was president of Norway's largest insurance
company, Store Brand group, and executive vice-president of Vesta insurance
group.
His record at the NIB parallels the innovation and growth Sir William has
achieved at the IFC. He established the Nordic Environmental Finance
Corporation to invest in joint ventures in central and eastern Europe and
helped initiate the Baltic Investment Programme, administered by the NIB, to
boost development of small and medium-sized business in the Baltic.
Sir William's tenure at the IFC coincided with a US push for increased
private sector development and democratisation of the developing countries
throughout Latin America. With US prodding, the IFC secured two capital
increases and investment soared from Dollars 400m in fiscal 1984 to Dollars
2.1bn (Pounds 1.4bn) in 1993. During that period profits rose from Dollars
25m to over Dollars 200m.
The IFC is 'financially very strong', Sir William said, but profits this
year were cut by the fighting in the former Yugoslavia and by lower US
interest rates. The corporation has invested heavily and mostly successfully
in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, where it has also played a
principal advisory role in privatisation activities.
Its investments in Latin America are 'another success story', Sir William
said, but its African financing activities are his greatest disappointment.
The African fund set up in 1988 was originally expected to break even in
1995, but 'the environment has been very difficult'. No profits are expected
until after the year 2000.
Mr Lindbaek is considered to be, like Sir William, an innovator. Born in
Oslo in 1939, he attended the Norwegian School of Business Administration
and Economics and was a Fulbright Scholar. He and his family live in
Helsinki.

FT  28 JUN 93 / German unions hit out at cuts: Waigel's plans to curb
public-sector deficit draw fire from both sides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE union leaders in Germany warned this weekend of all-out opposition to
the cuts in social spending planned by Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, as
part of his latest drive to curb the public-sector budget deficit.
At the same time, leaders of German industry have warned that the package
may not be tough enough to control the deficit and therefore to give the
German Bundesbank room for further cuts in its leading interest rates.
The package, which Mr Waigel hopes to finalise in negotiations with
ministerial colleagues, and members of the parliamentary parties in the
ruling coalition, by tomorrow night, is supposed to cut public spending by
DM30bn (Pounds 12bn) next year, by DM35bn in 1995 and DM40bn in 1996.
Key components are a 3 per cent across-the-board cut in unemployment and
social assistance benefits, imposition of a 32-month time limit on
unemployment pay, a pay freeze in the public sector, and cancellation of
'bad weather pay' for workers in the building industry.
Mr Heinz-Werner Meyer, chairman of the German trade union federation (DGB),
described the package as 'anti-social and therefore unacceptable' to the
trade union movement. He warned of opposition from the labour movement 'with
all the means at our disposal', clearly implying strike action, although
political strikes are illegal.
IG Bau building workers' union also threatened strike action if 'bad weather
money', compensating construction workers for idle days, is cancelled.
Mr Rudolf Scharping, the new national chairman of the opposition Social
Democrats, added his voice against cuts in social spending, although he
hinted that some compromise might be necessary.
Mr Waigel seems to be determined to hold his line for a savings package
which is merely intended to keep the federal government's budget deficit to
DM70bn in 1994 - the same as the probable outcome in 1993, compared with an
original target of DM43bn.
He repeated at the weekend that it was wrong for unemployed workers to earn
more than those with jobs, and wrong for those on social assistance to get
as much as those who have paid their unemployment benefit.
His plan would cut a married worker's dole money from 68 to 65 per cent of
net income, and that of an unmarried worker from 63 to 60 per cent.
Mr Waigel held talks last week with most of his departmental colleagues,
including Mr Matthias Wissman, the transport minister (who faces a freeze on
all new west German road building), and Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics
minister, who is being asked to cut subsidies to the coking coal industry.
Today he has an important meeting with Mr Volker Ruhe, defence minister,
before presenting his package to the leaders of the parliamentary parties in
the ruling coalition.
Although the budget is to be finalised only by July 13, Mr Waigel and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl want to have the savings package agreed before the
Group of Seven summit on July 7-9. They expect to face renewed pressure
there for tougher spending control, in order to give the Bundesbank room for
more interest rate cuts.

FT  28 JUN 93 / The European Market: Hunting the Euro-consumer - Common
market or not, EC citizens remain intractably individual
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAR from offering marketing managers a conformist, 'Euro-consumer' paradise,
the EC's citizens remain intractably individual. Research by Mintel provides
extensive evidence - 16 volumes of it in all - of huge diversity in the
European market of 340m consumers.
It is impossible to give a complete breakdown of the picture Mintel has
built up after questioning more than 7,000 consumers in Belgium, Britain,
France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. But the flavour of the
mix of consumer attitudes should be taken into account by any business
toying with the idea of pan-European marketing.
Mintel's report suggests that certain trends prevail throughout the EC -
generally higher spending on healthcare than a decade ago, yet lower
spending on food and drink - even though individual markets have markedly
different characteristics. For anyone involved in marketing across EC
borders it is vital to understand this apparent contradiction.
Take new products. Multinational companies increasingly seek to launch new
products across the whole of Europe, not just one or two countries. Knowing
what influences consumers to sample a new product is a vital piece of
marketing information.
And knowing that the French are twice as likely as the European average (22
per cent against 11 per cent) to sample a new product if they see it being
endorsed by a celebrity - as Mintel's survey has discovered - could make a
big difference in the manner and costs of marketing that new product in
France.
In the UK only 1 per cent of those asked said they would be influenced into
new product sampling by seeing it endorsed by a celebrity.
Similarly, the perceived power of advertising differs across the EC. In
Italy (50 per cent) and France (55 per cent) more than half those questioned
said all forms of advertising played a key role in prompting a purchase. Yet
in Spain only 31 per cent said that advertising had an effect on their
spending habits.
When it comes to particular media, habits are again widely different. Just 9
per cent of Spaniards claim to be influenced by magazine and newspaper
advertising, whereas in France the figure is 29 per cent. Across the six
countries an average of 19 per cent said they were influenced by magazine
and newspaper advertising, against just 6 for radio advertising.
Marketing takes many forms, with some of the most influential the least
visible. Sales promotions, direct mail, free-trial offers and money-off
coupons meet a widely different consumer response across the EC.
While just 4 per cent of Dutch respondents admitted to being influenced by
eye-catching package designs, the figure shoots to 21 per cent of French
shoppers. Only 22 per cent of Dutch admit to being swayed by money-off
coupons, yet 67 per cent of French find it an important factor.
And just as current purchasing practices are far from homogeneous, future
ones are likely to be highly variable.
Mintel asked respondents what they would spend more on if their incomes
increased by 25 per cent. Of those opting to spend more on leisure
activities, 22 per cent of the French would raise spending on meals outside
the home; just 6 per cent of the Italians would make that choice.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Ciampi sets wages deadline: Italian premier raises stakes in
union talks with employers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Italy's prime minister, has tossed the survival of
his fragile government into the ring in a last-minute attempt to force
employers and trade unions to agree on a new wage bargaining system.
Mr Ciampi set a deadline of July 5 for an accord. Failing an agreement, he
implied that his two-month-old government could fall.
Mr Ciampi said a wage deal was essential for Italy to maintain its fight
against inflation and credibility in international markets. He made clear
the negotiations would not be allowed to drag on and resume after the
holiday period if the two sides could not reach a compromise by next Monday.
The warnings followed a tense week during which neither unions or employers
showed any sign of compromise, but with neither side wanting to take
responsibility for a breakdown.
The government will continue individual talks with union leaders and the
Confindustria employers' federation this week in an attempt to bridge
differences. Bilateral discussions with Confindustria are due today, and a
new round of meetings with union leaders is scheduled for Wednesday.
The discussions follow last July's agreement between employers and unions to
abolish the scala mobile wage indexation system. The accord, hailed as a
breakthrough in restraining inflationary wage rises, helped substantially to
improve Italy's international competitiveness.
However, crucial issues were put off pending further discussions between
unions and employers and it is these negotiations which have now reached a
head. Last week, fears of a breakdown started to affect share prices and the
lira.
Although there has been some narrowing of the differences, the two sides
remain apart on the overall structure of the labour market and the details
of new contractual arrangements for workers.
The trade unions have fiercely resisted Confindustria's demands for greater
labour flexibility, especially for young people. With membership under
pressure in the recession and signs of a drift towards extreme splinter
groups outside the main trade union structure, union leaders have been loath
to dilute existing demarcation and job security provisions.
The question of contractual arrangements is more complex. Employers want to
simplify the present, multi-level bargaining system and gear pay more
closely to companies' profitability. The unions are highly uneasy about such
changes.
Mr Giuliano Graziosi, a former managing director of the state-controlled
Stet telecommunications group, has been arrested on allegations of paying
kickbacks for contracts to the former ASST state telecoms group. Mr Graziosi
is the latest senior telecommunications executive to be enmeshed in
corruption allegations involving ASST.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIQUE de Marseille, the successful French football team owned by Mr
Bernard Tapie, the left-wing politician and businessman, has contested
allegations that its staff rigged a crucial match.
Mr Christophe Robert, a striker for Valenciennes, was questioned by French
public prosecutors on Saturday, suspected of having received a FFr250,000
(Pounds 29,400) bribe to fake an injury against Marseille last month.
Marseille went on six days later to beat AC Milan in the final of the
European Cup, becoming the first French team to win the title. Valenciennes
was relegated to the second division after losing.
Charges have yet to be made, but the investigation is likely to ensure
French football comes under fresh public scrutiny. Mr Tapie, who made
enemies in the football world a few years ago by leading a campaign against
corruption, firmly denied his staff were involved in such practices.
'One cannot cheat at that level,' Mr Tapie said.
The allegations came from another Valenciennes player, Mr Jacques Glassmann,
who claimed Mr Jean-Pierre Bernes, Marseille's general secretary, and Mr
Jean-Jacques Eydelie, a Marseille player, telephoned members of the opposing
team to offer cash inducements to play badly.
Mr Bernes has sued and Mr Eydelie last week voluntarily approached the
public prosecutor on the issue. Both deny the allegations.
