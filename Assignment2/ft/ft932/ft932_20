TWO US oilmen working in a remote part of Yemen have been abducted by
tribesmen, Reuter reports from Sana.
The two Americans and their Yemeni driver, all working for Dallas-based Hunt
Oil, were ambushed on Tuesday afternoon in an area where Hunt has a big
concession. The government was negotiating for their release, a company
source said.
Several Hunt employees have been abducted in the past two years by
tribesmen. All have been released unharmed.

FT  27 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Many trials on the long road to harmony in
drug testing - Peter O'Donnell reviews progress on common clinical standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER O'DONNELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF a European company wants to market a drug in the US, the chances are it
will have to conduct two new clinical trials there. To launch it in Japan,
it will have to conduct entirely different preclinical testing.
The diversity of national drug regulations has impeded pharmaceutical trade
and rising expectations of drug performance are making things worse.
As new testing techniques become available, national requirements on drug
launches become more onerous. It couldn't have come at a worse time - just
as each expensively developed medicine needs to be brought rapidly into
revenue generation on as many markets as possible, there are loud calls for
closer international alignment of drug testing requirements.
It is not only the drug industry pushing for change. Far-sighted regulators
perceive that duplication of testing is not only a drain on resources, but
can also delay patient access to valuable new drugs. 'Unnecessary repetition
of trials is unethical,' said the EC Commission's Fernand Sauer at a meeting
in Brussels last month.
Moves towards harmonisation of requirements are nothing new in Europe's
patchwork quilt of drug markets, where diverse rules complicate the lives of
companies seeking international exposure for their drugs.
In the European Community, the first directive on pharmaceuticals in 1965
aimed at a balance: to 'safeguard public health', but in a way that 'will
not hinder' trade in medicines.
The latest stage of this EC development is the European Medicines Agency -
now on the point of becoming a reality. There are also numerous moves to
bring Efta countries and Central and Eastern Europe into a form of
pan-European harmonisation.
But the most ambitious recent initiative in pursuit of drug-rule
harmonisation involves the big three: the USA's Food and Drug
Administration, the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare, and the drug
division of the Commission of the European Community, who are now
co-operating with one another and with the drug industry as part of an
International Conference on Harmonisation of drug regulation (ICH). A ICH
meeting is planned for later this year, and some significant tripartite
agreements are in prospect.
The subject matter of ICH is necessarily arcane, and its procedures
byzantine: in preparation for the Orlando meeting, expert working groups are
hammering out the minutiae of guidelines on stability testing, on medicines
for geriatrics, on dose-response studies, and on reproductive toxicology.
As Dr Francoise de Cremiers of Wyeth Ayerst Research in Paris says:
'Industry and regulators believe that harmonisation will reduce testing in
animals and, eventually, in humans, and will promote earlier access to
useful new medicines.'
Among outcomes listed by Mr Kumeo Shirota, senior managing director of the
Japanese Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association, are abolition of LD50
testing, shortened testing for repeated dose toxicity in rodents, and
unification of some drug monographs. Mr Marc Duchne of Searle is more
direct: 'This will save us money and stop us killing so many animals,' he
says.
Regulatory harmonisation at this level is far from easy - the search for
accommodations between schools of thought in Japan, Europe and the US has
repeatedly highlighted widely differing medical and cultural traditions.
Dr John Beary of the US Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association believes
this is an important part of the ICH process. 'In parallel to the scientific
agenda, ICH is also promoting common managerial and administrative methods
which help create a more efficient working environment,' he claims.
Harmonisation isn't universally welcome, either. Standardisation threatens
the status of people working in health authorities or within multinational
drug firms. And it can create discomfort: the strongest opposition to
European harmonisation has come from countries where a strong national
industry lobby feared that standardised drug evaluation would upset
privileged relationships with national authorities. National pride can be as
powerful a rallying cry as international trade.
Harmonisation is not a linear process, says Eigill Hvidberg, professor of
Clinical Pharmacology at Copenhagen's University Hospital. 'Even after
agreement in principle has been reached by an international group of
regulators on a common concept, it can take quite a time for the ripples to
spread outwards so that everyone is ready to accept a common rule,' he says.
This may be some time in coming. Progress on the European Medicines Agency
has again slowed down this month, putting in doubt its 1995 start date. And
an agenda is already under preparation for yet another ICH mega-meeting, in
Tokyo, in late 1995. For the drug industry, there are certainly no quick
fixes in sight on harmonisation of regulations.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Peseta in sharp fall against D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPANISH peseta, devalued by 8 per cent in the exchange rate mechanism of
the European monetary system earlier this month, fell sharply against the
D-Mark yesterday as nervousness about the outcome of the June 6 election
returned to the markets.
The currency fell 155 basis points during the day to close at Pta77.85 to
the D-Mark, the lowest it has traded since the devaluation - the third in
nine months - on May 13.
Dealers said a forecast of further interest rate falls, following Tuesday's
small benchmark cut, by Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister, had helped
weaken the peseta, along with market suspicions that the Bank of Spain had
been buying D-Marks in order to replenish its reserves.
But the movement yesterday raised the spectre of one further attack on the
currency before the election, especially as the opposition Partido Popular,
which may now be opening up a clear lead in opinion polls over the governing
Socialists, has consistently refused to make any clear statement on its
economic policy plans.
That has left markets worrying about remarks by PP leaders calling for quick
interest rate cuts of up to four points while at the same time displaying a
less than convincing commitment to holding the peseta inside the EMS. Polls
taken after a televised debate between its leader, Mr Jose Mara Aznar, and
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez show that more than 50 per cent of the
country gave the debate to Mr Aznar and that the debate swayed a large
number of undecided voters to the conservatives.

FT  27 MAY 93 / EC jobs plan aims to halve unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday unveiled a job-creation strategy which it
hopes will help halve unemployment in the EC by the end of the century,
writes Andrew Hill. At the same time, Mr Padraig Flynn, EC social affairs
commissioner, reaffirmed that the Commission was fully committed to the
setting of minimum social standards across the EC. 'The social dimension (of
EC policy) is up and running,' said Mr Flynn, who denied that Britain was
gaining any economic advantage by opting out of the social protocol of the
Maastricht treaty.
The EC-wide 'framework for employment', agreed by the Commission at its
meeting in Strasbourg, aims to improve the Community's comparatively poor
record on employment. Mr Flynn pointed out that only 60 per cent of the EC
workforce was employed, against 70-75 per cent in Japanese, US or
Scandinavian economies. He said economic growth alone would not be enough to
reduce the 17.4m EC jobless total. He said 9m jobs were created in the EC by
the booming economy of the mid-1980s, but unemployment fell only 3m.
The Commission proposes that member states should co-ordinate action, for
example by encouraging employees to adapt to different types of job and
practices - such as job-sharing - and 'investigating the scope for reducing
labour costs'.

FT  27 MAY 93 / China frees dissident as EC team probes human rights

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN UNREPENTANT Mr Xu Wenli, one of China's longest serving dissidents, was
freed from jail yesterday three years before his 15-year sentence expired.
His early release, apparently aimed at calming criticism in the West of
human rights violations, came as China faced censure over an EC mission to
Tibet.
Appearing gaunt and with several of his teeth missing, Mr Xu denied any
wrongdoing on his release, saying his political activities had been 'for my
country and my people'.
Mr Xu, 49, one of China's best-known dissidents, was arrested in 1981 and
sentenced the following year. He had been publisher of an underground
magazine, April 5 Forum, during the Democracy Wall protest period of the
late 1970s and is the sixth political prisoner to be given early release
this year. The Chinese gesture coincides with Washington's decision, due by
next week, on renewal of China's Most Favored Nation trading status. It also
appears to be aimed at improving its chances of securing endorsement for the
right to stage the 2000 Olympiad.
Mr Xu's release came as EC representatives met in Beijing to complete a
report of their recent mission to Tibet. The mission ended in recrimination
at the weekend with envoys protesting over detention of two Tibetans who had
been planning to make contact.
The streets of Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, were reported calm yesterday
after disturbances on Sunday and Monday in which large crowds of protesters
were dispersed by tear gas. Foreign travellers reported hearing automatic
gunfire.
Kieran Cooke adds from Singapore: China says it will not use force to pursue
its claim to the Spratlys, the disputed group of islands in the South China
Sea.
Mr Chi Haotian, the Chinese defence minister, who is visiting Malaysia, said
China still insists on its 'historical right' to the Spratly islands. But Mr
Chi said China also accepted the 'differing opinions' of other claimants -
Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan and Brunei.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Russia (11): The worst of both worlds - The
creative energies of the new entrepreneurs need to be carefully channelled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GENERAL secretary of Russia's tiny but noisy economic Freedom Party, Ms
Irina Hakamada, 38, wears tight mini-skirts and drives a Toyota. The
Soviet-born daughter of a Japanese Communist, she is a standard-bearer of
Russia's new class of entrepreneurs.
Taking the title used by Soviet Communist party leaders who ruled the
country for 70 years was originally intended as a joke. But the class she
represents is extremely serious about asserting itself - even if many of its
members are stashing away money and assets abroad just in case things do not
work out in Russia.
Having previously exercised influence on the political class indirectly,
many new rich will be standing for election at parliamentary elections
brought forward to the end of this year as a result of President Boris
Yeltsin's referendum victory.
Having begun to accumulate alternative sources of influence such as
newspapers and television time, all the new class needs is political
legitimacy.
Some potential national leaders are already emerging, including Mr Yegor
Gaidar, the former prime minister who launched the radical economic reforms
which have allowed the new class to flourish. As a mark of the gratitude and
respect which he commands, he was recently chosen to head the Association of
Privatised and Private Businesses.
Although it is not clear whether he will stand for parliament, one thing is
clear. Money will matter in the forthcoming elections in a way that
Communist party connections mattered in the last elections, held in 1990,
when the Soviet Union was still a monolithic state run by Communists.
Ms Hakamada says she will be among the new candidates, together with the
party's co-chairman, Mr Konstantin Borovol, the founder of one of Russia's
biggest commodity exchanges, and Mr Syvatoslav Fyodorov, a millionaire
eye-surgeon. She plans a western-style electoral campaign with a simple
message: Russia's entrepreneurs need genuine economic freedom to benefit
both the individual and society.
Mr Gaidar's liberalisation of most prices and trade last year both legalised
and multiplied entrepreneurs who had previously operated in conditions of
semi-illegality. But, for many of their compatriots, this has translated
into a living nightmare of capitalism as portrayed by Communist party
propaganda in the old days.
Moscow's roads are busy with flashy foreign cars, driven by the men in dark
glasses whose profession is invariably 'trade' or 'banking.' The streets are
also full of new shops, restaurants and kiosks selling imported luxuries
which most of the population cannot afford. The inequalities of capitalism
are there for all to see, with its benefits for the people still blurry.
Indeed, the interruption of the liberalisation programme, under conservative
pressure, has now given Russia the worst of both worlds. Price distortions,
soaring inflation, and a tumbling Russian currency mean it is far more
profitable to export Russia's natural wealth than to invest money inside the
country. With GNP getting smaller, a growing share of a shrinking pie for a
small group of people is potentially explosive.
Also enriching themselves are corrupt bureaucrats who retain control of
large areas of economic decision-making, together with some managers of
state-owned enterprises who are siphoning off profitable parts of businesses
for themselves through so-called 'nomenklatura privatisation.'
Russia's new rich rest in former Communist party establishment sanatoria,
and live in former Soviet leaders' country homes - at least until they have
time to build their own, grander dachas. They flaunt their wealth now rather
than hide it as before.
No wonder the results of last month's referendum surprised most of the
country's political class, showing 52 per cent support for unpopular,
divisive radical economic reforms. But the small margin of support also
shows that while most Russian people prefer moving forward to moving
backwards, a lot will have to be done to prove their instincts are right.
Russia already has a few wealthy entrepreneurs who are beginning to think
long-term. One example is Mr Andrei Chuguyevsky, 34, who won a tender to
exploit Russia's huge Udokan copper deposit (see report above), and says he
wants to turn to the 'real economy' as opposed to the export and trading
deals which have made him a rouble billionaire.
But he believes it remains an open question as to whether Russia will
advance along the path of a mafia state, uniting the interests of officials
and shrewd businessmen feeding off a distorted economy, or towards an open
market economy.
For the latter to take place, it is up to the government to devise policies
reversing a situation where it is only logical for entrepreneurs to act as
most do now.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Russia (10): Delays on mining deals - Problems in
exploiting Russia's vast resources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been a turbulent year for trying to mine Russia's huge wealth of
precious metals, stones, and non-ferrous metals.
For foreign companies, which have been told their investment is crucial to
help Russia switch to a market economy, it has been a time of mouth-watering
opportunity and frustration.
Despite an abundance of possibilities, virtually no western company can yet
claim to have struck a deal because of the state's slow progress in
establishing a clear framework for foreign investment in this rich sector.
This is not to say there has been no progress. But the authorities are still
coming to grips with new legislation that provides for the tendering of all
new deposits and a western-style licensing system.
Meanwhile, fledgling Russian entrepreneurs have successfully lobbied for
support against foreign competition in developing the country's natural
resources.
One of these entrepreneurs is Mr Andrei Chuguevsky, who has deftly - some
would say deviously - combined economic nationalism with an acknowledged
need for western capital and expertise.
In January, he won Russia's first international mining tender - to develop
the giant Udokan copper deposit in eastern Siberia - in alliance with a Hong
Kong businessman called Mr Eddie Wong, and using advice from Fluor Daniel,
the San Francisco-based mining consultancy.
'We need technical experience and management skills from the west. We cannot
invent a business culture by ourselves in Russia,' says Mr Chuguyevsky, a
34-year-old rouble billionaire, who has so far made his money from the
get-rich-quick trading and export operations of most Russian entrepreneurs.
He claims the only reason the tender was won by the Udokan Mining Company,
in which he holds 35 per cent, was because he had studied the project for
three years compared to the six months available to western giants like
Australia's BHP and Britain's RTZ - 'otherwise I cannot compete with (a
company such as) BHP,' he says.
Another trump-card in enlisting sympathy from the authorities was his
alliance with a dozen industrial plants, which have traditionally depended
on defence orders that have now dried up, as suppliers of machinery for the
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) project. The government has been unable to provide
much financial assistance to companies such as Uralmash, the engineering
giant being privatised, so was naturally attracted to the idea of helping
them help themselves.
But since his project was approved by the tender committee, Mr Chuguyevsky
has begun negotiating changes that would give him and Russian partners sole
control by buying out Mr Wong's 45 per cent stake. Mr Chuguyevsky also wants
to cancel a plan, devised by Mr Wong to help finance the deposit's
development by selling much of the copper concentrate to China for smelting
there. Under pressure from the Russian government, he now says that the
copper concentrate should be smelted in Russia, rather than be at the mercy
of a Chinese buyer.
Finally, it is far from clear that he will appoint Fluor Daniel project
manager as initially expected. He has approached BHP, as a potential
candidate for that role. Dismissing Mr Wong's arrangements for Allen &amp; Co, a
private US investment bank, to raise some of the finance, Mr Chuguyevsky
wants to involve other banks and multilateral organisations like the World
Bank's International Finance Corporation which have been hard-pressed to
find viable projects in Russia's difficult environment climate.
ANOTHER problem in opening the door to Russia's mining wealth has been
innate Russian reluctance to let go of rich resources to foreigners and a
tendency to move the goal posts in the name of reform.
A pioneer in trying to establish a foreign foothold in Russia's previously
closed gold industry has been a small Australian company called Star
Technology System. But Star has become caught in a time warp, allying itself
with a local Siberian gold producer to develop the country's biggest hard
rock gold deposit known as Sukhoi Log (Dry Gulch) before the new mining
legislation appeared, and now having to adapt to its requirements. While it
is supported by the State Property Committee, whose main role is privatising
state-owned enterprises, the project has run into opposition from other
parts of the administration. Not surprisingly, Sukhoi Log is being eyed
hungrily by the likes of Mr Chuguyevsky (pictured below), who may try to use
the same sort of formula which brought him Udokan: a plea on behalf of
Russian entrepreneurship and Russian industry, and later, maybe enlisting a
big foreign company to help him.
The country's diamond mining industry has been somewhat insulated from the
fray, although Ashton Mining of Australia has signed a preliminary agreement
to mine diamonds in the western Russian region of Karelia.
But the bulk of Russia's present diamond mining and marketing activities are
run by a new joint stock company called Almazy Rossli-Sakha (ARS), with
shares and management split between federal authorities and Yakutia, the
eastern region which mines 99 per cent of Russian diamonds.
Spawned by the old state monopoly combining diamonds and gold,
state-controlled ARS is closed to outside investors, with shareholders
including the fantastically fortunate staff with 23 per cent, and 5 per cent
held by the Russian army's pension fund. ARS is also responsible for
managing a five-year Soviet-era agreement expiring in 1995 to channel 95 per
cent of rough diamond exports through De Beers' Central Selling
Organisation.
But despite its closed and monopolistic nature, ARS has been promoting
market-orientated changes of its own. These involve dispensing with the
State Committee for Precious Stones and Metals' wasteful system of
distributing diamonds to Russia's diamond-cutting factories.
ARS is also considering overhauling the methods used to check the prices
paid by De Beers for Russian diamonds under an agreement which has been
contested by some economic nationalists as contrary to Russian interests.
But rather than pushing for the right to sell more than five per cent
independently - as advocated by the State Committee - ARS favours putting
all diamond exports through the CSO and then monitoring those directly. With
time, it would also like to get rid of the State Committee, an organisation
with an unclear role to play in emerging market conditions.
In the meantime, ARS has provided one sort of solution to the chronic
conflict between federal and local authorities over how to share Russia's
mineral wealth. This involves, quite simply, buying off both local
authorities and workers with a huge piece of the cake.

RUSSIA'S bankers are at the cutting edge of what is sometimes described as
the country's 'wild capitalism' - the reaping of big profits without
supervision. But for the more serious banks, attempts to 'civilise' the
market are crucial to long-term success.
A study financed by the European Commission found that Russia has too many
institutions calling themselves banks, with as many as 1,325 in the small
category, and 336 medium or large size.
'There exist roughly 80 to 130 commercial banks in Russia likely to comply
with western standards for banking activity,' says the report, adding that
such banks account for least 60 per cent of total capital and assets in the
banking system.
But high inflation and instability mean that even the biggest banks offer
only short-term finance instead of investment credit needed to overhaul the
economy - except when they are acting as transmission belts for cheap
central bank credits to industry and agriculture.
And even if the authorities managed to bring down inflation - exceeding
1,000 per cent a year - commercial lending in Russia would remain
complicated by a low rate of recovery and the absence of tools to assess
credit risk.
'The major problem is finding decent projects and implementing all the
necessary conditions. In Russia, we have a lot of good ideas but not a lot
of specialists,' says Mr Yuri Agapov, chairman of Credo Bank, one of the top
new commercial banks. 'The problem is not only checking commercial banks but
checking projects.'
While the country's distorted price structure and tumbling currency enable
commercial banks to make big profits on foreign exchange and financing raw
materials exports, the health of many banks - in particular those spawned by
former state-owned banks or founded by state-owned enterprises - is tied to
the inefficient enterprises they support.
THE fragility of the banks complicates the government's ambitions of
restructuring enterprises. The central bank itself, traditionally the
Communist state's cash-register, has so far failed to organise either an
efficient payments system or banking supervision. Its problems are
compounded by gaps in banking legislation and a loss of skilled staff to the
private sector. Not only is the central bank payments system known to lose
documents, it is open to fraud and bribery as witnessed by a big swindle of
central bank funds last year through forged transfer documents.
While the state remains paralysed by inefficiency, commercial banks are
increasingly taking matters into their own hands.
In response to the central bank system taking weeks to move money from one
account to another, groups of commercial banks have set up their own
clearing systems. With the help of foreign advisers, including western
central banks, the central bank of Russia is trying to overhaul the national
payments system, while commercial bankers hope their own clearing systems
will somehow spontaneously produce a unified western-style system.
Meanwhile, the banks are pressing ahead with the introduction of
market-style novelties like credit cards. Some are also devoting
considerable resources to computerising their operations and training their
staff abroad.
The activities of Incombank, another leading Russian commercial bank, are
fairly typical of the more serious institutions which are trying, in the
words of one banker, to 'be a bank, not a bag of state money'.
Only two to five per cent of its loans are 'long-term' (which means less
than five years in Russia) and they have typically financed real estate
deals, construction and the purchase of processing equipment for exporters
of Russia's natural wealth. Short-term credit has financed items such as
imports of foreign cars for the nouveaux riches, and exports of raw
materials.
'Nobody can dictate to whom we should give money,' said Mr Alexei Kuznetsov,
the bank's 34-year-old acting chairman (the chairman was in the United
States for training). 'It is not possible to limit us because we doing
everything for ourselves.' He said the bank had not received 'a kopeck' in
central bank funds, the distribution of which is also believed to be
facilitated by personal friendships with older-generation bosses of the
central bank bosses.
Incombank's plans to expand abroad include the possibility of establishing a
branch in Cyprus - to service clients who have set up offshore companies in
order to avoid taxation and arbitrary treatment by government authorities.
While acknowledging that some funds are illegally channelled into offshore
havens, Mr Kuznetsov said the bank's first duty was towards its customers -
'we know that when our clients put money in western trust companies, they
get robbed. When the money is not totally legal, they get miserable interest
rates,' he said. 'You can perfectly understand an enterprise for taking
money out of country. It is worried about the fate of its workers,
technology, instability.'
Although it has been one of the few banks to get its accounts audited by
western auditors, the notes to the accounts confirm the difficulties of
assessing the health of the bank's loan portfolio as borrowers struggle to
adjust to market conditions.
In contrast, Sberbank, the country's nationwide savings bank, has struggled
to break free from the stranglehold of the state, which has controlled it
for seven decades. But with the best will in the world, it remains trapped
by the difficult transition from a state-run economy to a market system, as
witnessed by a public squabble with the central bank over just how much
independence it should enjoy.
Although it has sought to diversify since it was transformed into a joint
stock company with shareholders including the central bank, Sberbank
continues to provide housing and home improvement loans at derisory interest
rates.
It also provides state-subsidised loans for 22 'socially useful' programmes,
like helping victims of the Chernobyl nuclear accident.
Finally, it acts as the state's agent when required, last year using its
unparalleled network to distribute privatisation vouchers to Russia's 148m
inhabitants.
IN January, however, Mr Vicktor Gerashchanko, the central bank chairman,
launched an attempt to take it over, undoing its status as a commercial bank
in order - he wrote in a letter to parliament - to 'protect' depositors from
the possibility of a US-style Savings and Loans crisis: 'Acting in
accordance with market laws and the realities of contemporary life,
(Sberbank) has in fact rejected its previous financial policy, designed to
satisfy the small depositor, and is increasingly looking for super profits.'
This was a striking accusation, given that the Soviet state has for decades,
including under his stewardship as governor of the Soviet central bank,
systematically appropriated the bank's deposits to finance the budget
deficit. Only recently, Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, managed to
get Sberbank to raise interest rates paid to depositors after the state
repaid money owed to it.
IT is against this chaotic background that the small number of foreign banks
with representative offices in Moscow are cautiously dipping a toe in the
Russian market by setting up branches.
But they remain wary of fresh lending after Vnesheconombank, the Soviet bank
responsible for servicing the former Soviet Union's foreign debt, defaulted
on payments and froze billions of dollars belonging to foreign companies.
Under pressure from the Russian commercial banks, which fear the westerners
simply want to grab their prized hard currency deposits, the central bank
recently produced rules limiting foreign banking activity in Russia.
But the rules are vague - saying that foreign banks will not exceed an as
yet unspecified percentage of total banking activity - that Mr Alexander
Khandruyev, a deputy governor of the central bank, suggests they are
intended as a deliberate fudge to reconcile conflicting interests.
The downside to the Russian banks' tumultuous growth is the central bank's
inability to take on the challenge of supervising them to enhance public
confidence in the sector.
Mr Georgy Matiukhin, the former chairman of the central bank, said in a
recent interview that finding skilled people to do that job had been his
greatest failing - even his supervision chief had left to head a commercial
bank.
The central bank sharply raised minimum capital requirements this year to
try to squeeze out smaller institutions that are not performing banking
functions and in some cases have been set up to abuse central bank funds or
run off with deposits.
The EC report says this would mean that 90 per cent of banking institutions
would have to close down or merge with others, but no restructuring has been
visible so far.
The central bank's ability to enforce its own rules, and fully switch from
the role of state monopoly to market regulator, has yet to be proven.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Russia (8): A relentless slide in oil production -
Drastic measures are needed to curb the wasteful use of energy by industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF there is a single Russian industry where, in theory, reform has a chance
of making a palpable difference, it has to be the energy sector.
Nothing would do more to help the economy through the storms of the next few
years than an increase in production and exports of oil, still Russia's
largest hard currency earner by far. Nothing, unfortunately, could seem more
remote.
Oil production has been on a precipitous slide for more than three years,
and continues to fall at an annual rate of more than 10 per cent, with
output this year expected to drop below 350m tonnes, compared with a peak in
the late-1980s of close to 600m tonnes.
Mr Yuri Shafranik, the newly appointed fuel and energy minister, reckons it
will be 1995 before the trend begins to bottom out, but even that cannot be
taken for granted.
And in that year, unless drastic measures are taken now to curb the wasteful
use of energy by industry, Russia - now still the world's largest producer -
will find itself facing the need to import oil.
The litany goes on. Many of the country's best oil reservoirs have been
damaged by inappropriate extraction methods, and the industry lacks the
means to repair them. It is chronically short of money to invest.
Russian domestic oil prices are a tiny fraction of the world level; taxes
are onerous; and, in any case, few enterprises are paying in full for the
oil they buy - one insider reckons that oil producers will this year have in
effect given away oil to a value larger than that of the central bank
credits that are chiefly held responsible for fuelling inflation.
IF all that were not enough to leave the industry dead on its feet, there is
a chronic shortage of production equipment - 80 per cent of the
equipment-manufacturing capacity of the former Soviet Union is located in
now independent Azerbaijan.
Two things are desperately needed to begin turning things round. One is
radical reform of the domestic energy pricing regime, identified by the
World Bank as of key importance in Russia's transition from the command
economy, but sadly neglected since the Gaidar government's initial burst of
reform in early 1992.
A rise in prices towards the world level would stimulate production, curtail
wasteful consumption and eliminate the rampant corruption that currently
afflicts the industry. Yegor Gaidar himself now reckons that failure to
achieve complete liberalisation of energy prices last year was his biggest
single mistake.
The other requirement, which would be encouraged by a serious move on
prices, is significant investment in opening new fields and repairing old
ones by the large western integrated oil companies.
So far, there has barely been a trickle, perhaps Dollars 500m, a minuscule
amount when compared with the scale of the task, though the Group of Seven
leading industrial countries is taking steps to foster more.
THE problem is not a lack of will on the part of the oil majors, most of
which still regard the former Soviet Union as one of the great exploration
opportunities left to them and several of which have already struck
promising deals in other, perhaps better organised, republics of the
Commonwealth of Independent States - notably Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan.
The problem is the chaos in Russia. Whenever western oil industry executives
gather to talk about Russia, they chant a familiar chorus of complaints:
first is the lack of any form of stable institutional and legal framework
for investing in the country.
Second, pervasive uncertainty as to who is responsible for what in the
central Moscow bureaucracy, in regional government and in the sprawling oil
'production associations' that run the industry in Siberia and elsewhere and
that are currently being reorganised into large joint stock companies in
readiness for eventual partial privatisation.
Third, a punitive and constantly changing tax regime, reflecting the
government's ever-growing appetite for funds to plug its budget deficit and,
on occasion, local demands for infrastructure spending. Other gripes include
the fact that foreign companies tend to be offered only a limited range of
investment opportunities - and not usually in the best fields - and the
Russian government's tendency to impose difficult-to-meet local content
requirements on procurement of kit.
'The lack of a clear framework is still the greatest single obstacle to
western oil company investment,' Mr Mark Moody-Stuart, managing director of
Shell for exploration, told a gathering of western and Russian oil bosses in
February.
'For significant investment to take place, there must be a clear general
policy, applicable to all ventures, with manifest legislative support to
ensure stability. We still seem to be some distance away from such
conditions,' he says.
This is more than just another industry whinge about 'level playing fields.'
Everyone in the business concurs that the reason why there has been so
little foreign investment thus far is that Russia presents a unique
concatenation of risks, with very little prospect of adequate returns for a
western oil company.
The tax system that has sprung up in the past year, for example - an
impenetrable thicket of export tariffs, royalty payments and other levies
based on production volumes rather than revenues - almost guarantees that
the most promising project will stand little chance of turning a profit.
Apart from a desire for revenue, this reflects deep-seated political
opposition to the involvement of foreign capital in exploiting Russia's
natural resources - a fact which acts as a residual deterrent to the western
oil companies.
'The international oil companies are used to living with political
instability, but they have to be assured of some return,' says Mr George
Reese, an oil expert with Ernst and Young in Moscow.' In the North Sea, the
tax regime may be onerous, but at least it's profit-based. Here, the risks
are political, technical and financial.'
That has certainly been the experience of one of the small and brave band of
western companies that have taken the plunge: Phibro of the US, with its
'White Nights' joint venture in western Siberia.
In operation for two years, the enterprise has yet to come within sight of a
return, thanks in part to payment problems with some of its Russian partners
and to the government's tardiness in fulfilling a promise to give it a
special exemption from export tax.
Clearly Mr Shafranik, the new energy minister who built up a strong
reputation as a defender of oil producer interests in his previous job as
governor of Siberia's oil-rich Tyumen region, faces a daunting set of
challenges. He says he is anxious to attract investment both in upstream and
downstream oil projects, and in the equipment industry.
More promisingly from the perspective of western oil companies, he also says
he wants to do something about the tax regime - 'certainly I'm not satisfied
with our tax policy. I try to solve it on my level, and I'm sure it will be
solved to the benefit of the oil producers.'
Mr Shafranik's forceful presence in government is among the more hopeful
signs foreign oil industry observers can discern amid the gloom. Another is
that the authorities appear to have begun listening more closely to the
western companies' concerns, with Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister,
recently receiving a joint submission from 20 oil majors grouped in the
newly-founded Petroleum Advisory Forum.
ULTIMATELY, however, the proof of the government's better intentions will
come only through better experience. For this, the industry is closely
watching the progress of a consortium of western companies - McDermott and
Marathon of the US, Japan's Mitsui and Mitsubishi, and the Anglo-Dutch group
Shell - bidding to exploit some of the large gas reserves off Sakhalin
island in the Russian far east.
Having won the tender for a feasibility study last year, after much
confusion between federal and local authorities, they are now waiting to
learn whether they can proceed to the development stage. If this Dollars
10bn project goes even moderately smoothly, oil executives say it will serve
as a bellwether for the industry as a whole.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Russia (7): Struggle to unbundle the monolith -
The 'near abroad' / Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST MONTH, political leaders from one of Russia's volatile and ethnically
diverse southern border regions met to discuss forming an economic
association. They swiftly got into an acrimonious row. The subject? The
varying sums different areas were charging for deposits on re-useable
bottles, which had caused an increasingly disruptive bottle arbitrage trade
around the region.
Mr Sergei Shakhrai, a top adviser to President Boris Yeltsin, tells this
anecdote to underline the potential for friction among the multifarious
population groups of the former Soviet Union - 'you start with a difference
over bottle deposits,' he says. 'But in that you have a potential ethnic
conflict waiting to erupt.'
The pattern repeats itself in different forms throughout what Russians call
the 'near abroad,' and to an extent in Russia itself, as peoples long
condemned to uneasy cohabitation seek to redefine their relations and in
some cases to redraw the map.
On the southern periphery, in the Trans-Caucasian and central Asian
republics, ethnic and religious wars have claimed thousands of lives,
uprooted thousands more from their homes, and embroiled Russian forces in
controversial peace-making or peace-keeping exercises. In the Baltic states,
tensions run ever higher over the political rights of their substantial
Russian minorities, raising a lingering question-mark over the complete
withdrawal of Russian forces.
Most difficult of all, Moscow is engaged in a highly-charged and
interrelated set of disputes over assets, trade, military forces and
territory with the second biggest former Soviet republic, Ukraine, as the
latter gropes for full independence from Russia.
Disentangling the affairs of the Russian and Soviet empires was always going
to be a nightmare. The 15 successor states are not merely grappling with the
legacy of centuries of more or less repressive rule from the centre. They
are faced with the task of unbundling the most monolithic economic and
political system in the history of the world. An economy in which central
planning distorted all price relationships, and frequently dictated that
production of one item be mainly concentrated in one place, finds its
nervous system collapsing.
Inter-republican trade has all but broken down, for want of the means of
payment: several countries, including Ukraine, have left the rouble zone and
set out to print their own monies, only to find them collapsing in value
more rapidly even than the Russian currency.
Disputes over the military and other spoils are only slowly being resolved.
The scope and structure of the Commonwealth of Independent States, supposed
to provide a framework for a looser form of association between the former
Soviet republics, remain in contention. The potential for conflict is
immense: indeed, the surprise is perhaps the extent to which the leaders of
Russia and the other republics have thus far managed to keep it under
control.
For Russia, by far the largest of the successor states, these issues pose a
number of difficulties that require especially sensitive handling.
The conflicts to its south are a constant worry, threatening either to spill
over into Russia proper or otherwise to destabilise it through a growing
exodus of refugees. The worst and longest-running of these is the war
between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the Armenian enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh, in which Moscow has studiously sought to remain neutral
but has made sporadic attempts to mediate.
In several cases, however, Russian troops stationed outside Russia's borders
are now directly involved:
In the central Asian republic of Tajikistan, scene of a violent struggle
between Moslem and ex-communist forces last year, they are deployed to
police the border with Afghanistan, source of support for the Islamic
fundamentalists.
In northern Moldova, the Russian 14th army is now keeping a fragile peace
between regular Moldovan forces and the ethnic Russian minority of
Trans-Dnestr, after intervening on the latter's side in fighting last year.
In the fractious and disintegrating republic of Georgia, Russian forces are
trying to hold the line in one civil conflict - that between the government
of Mr Eduard Shevardnadze and south Ossetian separatists demanding
unification with their kin the other side of the Russian border - and are
frequently accused (so far without evidence) of involvement in another,
between Georgia and separatist rebels in Abkhazia. In all these cases, there
is a potentially dangerous ambiguity about Russia's role. Moscow insists
that the aim is purely to keep the peace and mediate, but many in the
republics concerned suspect that more partisan motives.
Moreover, an effort by President Yeltsin to clarify the position earlier
this year arguably made matters worse. In a speech to the centrist Civic
Union grouping at the end of February, he said that, given its 'heartfelt
interest' in suppressing conflicts around its borders, Russia should be
granted 'special powers' by the United Nations to guarantee peace and
stability in the former Soviet Union. No amount of subsequent explanation by
the foreign ministry that he was simply talking about the need for UN
political or financial support for specific, mutually agreed peacekeeping
operations could quite dispel the impression that he was asking the world to
give Russia a free hand to intervene beyond its borders.
This is a question of acute sensitivity, not least because of the large
number of ethnic Russians - 25m - who live outside Russia. Such minorities
in other republics - in Kazakhstan, they constitute nearly half the
population - could easily become the object of nationalist passions and a
cause celebre in Russia itself. Some even murmur of the risk of
Yugoslav-style 'ethnic cleansing.'
Mr Yeltsin's answer to this danger has been to attempt to hasten integration
efforts within the CIS. An emerging 'hard core' of Commonwealth members -
Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and the central Asian republics - have signed a
defence treaty with this end in mind.
But that does not ease the worries of those new republics that have chosen
to stay outside the CIS framework. Take the Baltic states. In Latvia and
Estonia in particular, efforts by legislators to deprive Russian residents
of some of their political or civil rights have drawn a series of
increasingly blunt warnings from Moscow, with President Yeltsin vowing to
halt the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic region. Although
foreign ministry officials insist troop withdrawals are proceeding to plan,
it remains uncertain whether they will all be out by the previously
announced deadline of mid-1993.
It is the continuing struggle between Russia and Ukraine - which belongs to
the CIS but has no interest in signing the collective defence treaty - that
provides the greatest cause for concern. Since the collapse of communism,
the two states have been in contention over a range of issues, from the
division of the USSR's assets and external debt (though the latter question
has now been resolved, removing one obstacle to a Russian debt rescheduling
deal) to energy supplies, with Russia demanding that Ukraine in future pay
world prices for its oil and gas.
The two most serious, however, concern ownership of the Soviet Black Sea
Fleet, stationed in the port of Sebastopol in the disputed Crimea region,
and nuclear weapons. On both questions, the climate between Moscow and Kiev
appears to be worsening. Ukraine accuses Russia of seeking to use the Black
Sea Fleet issue to press its old claim to Crimea, and of refusing to
recognise its borders in a comprehensive treaty. Russia growls in response.
And in its insecurity, Ukraine seems increasingly tempted to hang on to at
least some of the former Soviet nuclear missiles and nuclear-armed strategic
bombers still on its territory.
Few believe that the two rivals are likely to come to blows over any of
these issues, at least under their current leaders. But the long list of
unresolved matters between them should worry western governments all the
same. For one thing, with the Russian parliament refusing to ratify the
Start 2 strategic arms limitation treaty with the US until its Ukrainian
counterpart agrees to go non-nuclear, it could seriously disrupt the
international arms-control process.
In the longer term, there are deeper underlying strains which, under changed
political circumstances in either Russia or Ukraine, could flare up into
something much worse. Given the long history of Russian rule and the fact
that Russian nationhood was born in what is now Ukraine, has Moscow
genuinely accepted Ukrainian independence? Will it be prepared to allow the
CIS to develop into the loose association focused mainly on economic
relations that Kiev seems to want?
How Russia decides to handle its biggest former Soviet bedfellow will have
an important bearing on its relations with the others - and with the wider
world.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Russia (6): Hardliners retain formidable blocking
power - Foreign policy / Courting western political and financial support
remains paramount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR 45 minutes last December, government ministers from north America and
all over Europe found themselves half-wondering whether their world was
coming apart.
If their ears had not deceived them, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign
minister and a man known for his outspokenly pro-western views, had just
told a gathering of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe
that his country's post-communist policies of working with the west were at
an end; that its interests elsewhere set limits to its rapprochement with
western Europe; and that Nato was courting confrontation by interfering in
the affairs of the former Soviet bloc.
He had, in other words, just appeared to junk the whole strategy that had
made the end of the cold war possible - and demanded an end to sanctions
against Russia's ally Serbia to boot.
Fortunately it was no more than an appearance. After hectic consultations,
Mr Kozyrev coolly took the podium again, saying his earlier speech had been
a pack of lies - a rhetorical warning to the west of what would happen to
Russian foreign policy if President Boris Yeltsin were swept from power by
his conservative and nationalist opponents.
For western governments, it was a stunt in the worst possible taste but one
not without resonance. Indeed, the brief alarm Mr Kozyrev managed to
generate in Stockholm was eloquent testimony to the uncertainties that
continue to shroud Russia's bold attempt to align itself with the west and
join the club of great capitalist democracies.
The broad lines of this strategy are not in doubt, and as the foreign
minister said they will not be so as long as President Yeltsin survives. On
the contrary: as his political travails at home have grown in recent months,
he has come to rely all the more - like Mikhail Gorbachev before him - on
foreign policy successes.
Courting western political and financial support, of course, remains
paramount, as symbolised in the Yeltsin-Clinton summit in Vancouver, in the
Russian leader's prospective attendance at the Group of Seven summit in
Tokyo in July, and in his desire to sign a free trade deal with the European
Community as soon as this summer.
But other important relationships have also been receiving increased
presidential attention in the past year - those with China (often cited as
an economic model for Russia by those who oppose Mr Yeltsin's reforms),
South Korea (a significant potential investor and rival to Japan) and India.
In the Middle East, ties have been repaired with Iran and with Syria.
If it once seemed as if Russia's domestic woes were causing it to turn in on
itself, the retreat from the world is now over. There may not yet be an
over-arching vision of Russia's international role - no easy matter for a
country straddling two continents, a third of the earth's land surface and a
patchwork quilt of ethnicities and religions. But that it wants to be a
player is not in doubt.
In recent months, however, Mr Yeltsin has not been immune from attack on the
foreign policy front. And as a result, the government has been forced to
trim its sails on some issues and to set out a position that is more
distinctive, less automatically acquiescent with the west, on others. As Mr
Sergei Karaganov, head of Moscow's Institute of Europe and a foreign policy
adviser to Mr Yeltsin, puts it: 'We are paying the price of saying 'yes'
even before we were asked. Now we have to fight for our interests - and some
of them will be different from those of the west.'
For the opposition in parliament, Mr Yeltsin's pro-western posture is a
useful stick with which to beat him in their domestic power struggle: it
accuses him of kow-towing and failing to defend Russia's vital interests,
and has been demanding Mr Kozyrev's dismissal for the best part of a year.
Hardline nationalists and communists go further, advocating the
reconstitution of the former Soviet Union or aggressive measures to protect
the 25m ethnic Russians living outside Russia's borders, the pursuit of arms
sales to renegade states in the Middle East such as Iraq and Libya, and
support for fellow Slavs in Serbia against international pressure.
More than political slogans are at stake in this latter-day version of the
age-old Russian battle between slavophiles and westernisers. The hardliners
can command up to 40 per cent of the votes in parliament, and although they
do not thus far appear to have had much impact on Mr Kozyrev's day-to-day
diplomacy, they do have formidable blocking powers when combined with the
third or so of centrist deputies who tend to side with them on foreign
policy questions.
The result is that several important international treaties are still
awaiting ratification, including the Start 2 US-Russian strategic arms
limitation agreement which parliament says it has no intention of ratifying
until it receives Mr Kozyrev's scalp.
Senior foreign ministry officials do not attempt to disguise their
frustration with such parliamentary antics.
'We can't talk to these people,' says Mr Sergei Yastrzhemsky, Mr Kozyrev's
spokesman, of the government's 'red-brown' opponents. 'They don't know any
words of argument, only tired old ideological cliches.'
As one example of the trouble they can cause, he cites a treaty between
Russia and Hungary which deputies have blocked on the grounds that it
contains an apologetic reference to the 1956 Soviet invasion.
Whether these disputes have a much broader political effect is hard to say.
Even Russian foreign policy pundits agree that most of the populace are far
more pre-occupied with the struggle for daily survival than with esoteric
questions concerning their country's role in the world.
But such issues can on occasion take on symbolic significance in a country
many of whose citizens still feel confused and humiliated by defeat in the
cold war and by the loss of empire. The dispute with Japan over the Kurile
islands, which the Soviet Union occupied at the end of World War Two and
which Tokyo badly wants back, is one example.
Repeated attempts to arrange a Japanese visit by Mr Yeltsin over the past
year have foundered, at least in part because the Russian president has felt
it politically impossible to offer sufficient concessions. The issue will
inevitably continue to bedevil Russian-Japanese relations, and limit Japan's
willingness to provide Moscow with aid outside the multilateral framework of
the G7, for the foreseeable future.
The conflict in the former Yugoslavia, where Russia has been broadly
supportive of western-led mediation efforts, has lately become another
domestic political football. Under fierce attack in April for not showing
sufficient solidarity with the Serbs, the government sent its own peace
envoy to Belgrade and felt obliged to distance itself from western policy by
abstaining in a UN Security Council vote on tightening sanctions.
It was not until after his referendum victory on April 25 that President
Yeltsin felt bold enough fully to rejoin the international consensus and
issue an unequivocal ultimatum to Serbia.
Mr Karaganov of the Institute of Europe says the west has no reason for
concern at such manoeuvrings - 'almost nobody is interested in Serbia here,
but the opposition just plays it up to make things difficult for the
administration, and the administration has to bow to that,' he says. 'It
could just as easily be replaced tomorrow by another symbol.'
As for the extremists' slavophilia - 'the plan to build up a Slavophile
world is a dream. Nobody here is really thinking of it.'
Like others in the Moscow think-tanks, Mr Karaganov believes that the debate
on foreign policy is just another weapon in the battle for power. And it is
certainly true that the policy prescriptions of Mr Yeltsin's sworn enemies
do not stand up to a moment's serious inspection. Those like Vice-president
Alexander Rutskoi who advocate alliances with pariah states such as Iraq and
North Korea, for example, claim Russia could earn huge sums of money from
arms sales in the process - a patently ridiculous notion since neither has
the means to pay.
'Those who call for alliances with irresponsible states,' concludes Mr
Karaganov, 'are merely trying to provoke hostile reprisals from the west.
For it is only under those circumstances of isolation that they stand a
chance of coming to power. But actually, even most nationalists understand
that we need the outside world for its technology, its products, even its
culture.'
In that last sentence, perhaps, lies one of the two principal dangers for Mr
Yeltsin's current foreign policy course. For in tying itself so closely to
the west and its reforms so directly to prospective western financial
assistance, the government may eventually face a backlash if aid on a scale
sufficient to make a difference fails to materialise.
Public opinion has been disappointed on this count before, with less than
desirable political consequences. As Mr Karaganov puts it: 'People were
romantic about this aid. They were promised so much, and so little was
delivered. Then when they saw it was not coming, they instantly became more
nationalistic.'
The other big danger is that such tendencies could be fuelled by conflicts
in Russia's immediate neighbourhood, especially if Russia itself were
somehow to become militarily embroiled.
That is not a far-fetched notion, as western governments are uneasily aware.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Russia (5): Mass privatisation in practice -
Edward Balls and Gillian Tett meet the new breed of entrepreneur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN city of Volgograd, 600 miles south of Moscow, is at the
forefront of the government's privatisation drive. Close co-operation
between the regional branch of the privatisation ministry and the local
parliament controlled state property fund, with advice from the
International Finance Corporation - the private sector investment arm of the
World Bank - have enabled the region to privatise 336 small-scale state
enterprises.
Since mass voucher privatisation began in Volgograd in the beginning of
February, 50 medium and large-scale enterprises have been sold, ranging in
size from a few hundred to 26,000 employees. But although all of them claim
to be moving towards market reforms, 'privatisation' often means very
different things to Russia's new entrepreneurs.
So what does privatisation really amount to for managers, workers and
shareholders in a selection of newly privatised enterprises in the city of
Volgograd and the surrounding countryside?
THE DRESS-MAKER - A NEW-STYLE ENTREPRENEUR
BACK in the days of Soviet state planning, Mrs Lilia Tataleyeva's Volgograd
dress shop used to sell two designs of Russian raincoat - one for summer,
and one for winter. Today the newly privatised shop is undergoing a fashion
revolution.
As in many privatisation success stories, the main factor in the turnabout
has been the entrepreneurial energy of one individual.
A forceful woman who dresses with elegance, Mrs Tataleyeva spent five years
working as the frustrated director of the state-owned shop under the control
of the local ministry - 'before, we had to send all our designs to the state
sewing factory. By the time they were ready, fashion had changed,' she says.
Eighteen months ago, Mrs Tataleyeva along with 17 colleagues launched a bid
for the enterprise. The collective beat three other bids with an offer of
2.5m roubles, subsequently reduced to 1.7m roubles in accordance with state
regulations which favours bids from worker collectives by offering a 30 per
cent discount.
'Now that seems a very low price. But then it was a very high price,' says
Mrs Tataleyeva, who has succeeded in paying off 1m roubles of the credit
they took at 60 per cent annual interest.
With the new dress shop making a monthly turnover of about 800,000 roubles,
she is confident she will soon pay off the rest of the loan, although the
galloping inflation that has reduced the value of the loan is also making a
mockery of her attempts at financial planning.
But Mrs Tataleyeva revels in her new responsibilities: 'We are currently
making a summer collection and these days I cannot blame anyone else because
it is up to me if it fails,' she says, adding cheerfully. 'Most people do
not understand about privatisation. The others who work here get their
monthly wages and do not worry. But I do this all for myself. It is all me.'
THE WHOLESALER - BUILDING A RETAIL EMPIRE
THEY call her 'the iron lady of Volgograd.' With blue-rinsed hair, carefully
applied make-up and the compulsory fax machine on her desk, Mrs Tamara
Sitnikova, the 47-year-old executive director of the 'Boots and Shoes'
retail store, is typical of the modern Russian executive women, of which
there are a surprisingly large number.
Mrs Sitnikova must be one of the first Russian managers to be head-hunted.
Previously the manager of a state wholesale distributor, she was invited by
the five other shareholders to become a shareholder and manager of 'Boots
and Shoes', previously a state boots shop, when it was privatised last
summer.
Her experience in the state system means that 'Boots and Shoes' is tackling
one of small-scale privatisation's biggest deficiencies - the lack of a
reliable and competitive wholesale network. Mrs Sitnikova has tried to fill
this the gap by buying two lorries which she can use to distribute goods to
companies which cannot themselves buy store goods in bulk. In time, she
hopes to create a new and bigger company by taking over some of the small
shops she supplies.
The store has retained all its original 23 staff, two thirds of whom are
contract workers, but it has been forced to diversify away from footwear as
demand dwindled and now also sells food, cakes and pop-corn. Freedom from
direct bureaucratic control has advantages but also new problems. 'Taxes,
taxes, taxes' are Mrs Sitnikova biggest worry. She complains that 80 per
cent of the store's profits go to pay eighteen different types of taxes.
Mrs Sitnikova openly admits that she models herself on Mrs Margaret
Thatcher, the former British prime minister. 'People tell me that we are
pretty much alike both in character and in our leadership styles,' she says
with a smile. Her speech also has a Thatcherite tinge. 'The key to
privatisation is ownership,' she says. 'If you own a shop or have shares in
a company, you feel you really are somebody.'
Does she have any other personal ambitions? 'There are not many women who
are number one in Russia,' she replies. 'But my view is that only a woman
can save our country. Maybe we do need a woman as president too.'
MIXED VIEWS AT THE SWEET FACTORY
IN a country where factory directors have long been used to diligently
fulfilling state orders and plans - or at least, to make a show of doing so
 -it is rare to find directors in Volgograd who are prepared to speak out
openly against the government's privatisation plans. But at the newly
privatised Lenin Volgograd Sweet factory, the directors are less than
enthusiastic about privatisation.
'All this privatisation is a bit like a new state plan - a new five-year
plan,' says Mr Valentin Makhonin, the managing director, who admits that
faced with a choice between market anarchy and state-planning stability he
favours the latter.
The motive behind the Lenin sweet factory's move to the market was not an
ideological conviction or a new-found market, but instead a weary obedience
to this new state directive. Under instructions from local government
officials, the directors transformed the enterprise into a shareholding
company and 'sold' 51 per cent of the shares to the workers.
So far, Mr Makhonin claims the exercise has had only a limited impact on the
way the factory is run. 'The factory works as before. We sell the sweets to
the same places, and receive the orders from the same places - nothing has
really changed very much in the way we make sweets.'
But the plant has been hard hit by the breakdown in inter-republican trading
links. It lost its main supply of sugar from the Ukraine and suffered a 40
per cent fall in output, forcing a lay off of 200 of its 1,000-strong
workforce. Another 200 workers are expected to lose their jobs later this
year.
ENTHUSIASM AT THE WASHING MACHINE PLANT
MR Anatoly Tyulpin, managing director of Volgograd's 'Red Dawn' washing
machine factory, can hardly wait for his enterprise to be privatised.
Fifty-one per cent of the shares in the enterprise, which produces 190,000
washing machines a year and employs 700 workers, will be owned by the
workers and directors. But Mr Tyulpin is confident he will retain control.
Mass privatisation may be laying the foundations for the eventual emergence
of a thriving western-style stock market which would allow badly managed
companies to be taken over, but, for now, it is consolidating the power of
incumbent managers.
Red Dawn will be run by a management committee of the director and three
others, but Mr Tyulpin says he will have two votes.
Deciding what to make and how many people to employ will be the management's
perogative.
'Of course people would like to stay working here,' he says, 'but it will be
up to the management of the factory to decide who to fire.'
Mr Tyulpin plans to expand production by making metal-cutting machine tools
and expects to shed 150 workers. Surprisingly, the shop-floor workers at Red
Dawn appear to accept the management's right to manage.
'People are expecting lay-offs,' says Uri, a 30-year-old engineer. 'But the
first people to be fired will be the drunks, the ill-disciplined and the
lazy-bones.'
THE FARMERS - ONCE BITTEN, TWICE SHY
WHILE government officials in the city of Volgograd are trumpeting the
merits of the revolutionary new privatisation programme, out in the rural
village of Gorodizhe, 30km outside the city, the propaganda is being greeted
with a distinct sense of de ja vu.
Eighteen months ago, the village's state farm set itself up as a
shareholding company - an experiment which ended after only a year, when the
villagers decided they were fed up with the new 'share' system.
The reason for the villagers' disillusionment lie partly in local politics
and partly in the problems of delivering on the exuberant promises being
made for the new market system.
The man who was behind the farm's original decision to turn itself into a
shareholding company was its energetic, entrepreneurial director, the
52-year-old Mr Anatoly Chibatkov.
Believing that privatisation would allow the farm greater freedom in
economic decision making, 18 months ago he decided to set the 7000 hectare
farm up as a shareholding company.
Shares were distributed and sold to all farm workers, promises were made
about future dividends and profits, and Mr Chibatkov set about trying to
make the farm profitable.
But after a year the farm workers had received few dividends, and production
continued to fall.
Reaping the popular discontent, Mr Chibatkov's rival political faction in
the village pushed him out of office, bought back all the shares, and turned
the farm back into a 'collective' again.
'They gave us all these bits of paper and they were worthless,' said
Antonina, a 71-year-old pensioner, echoing a widespread cynicism over the
affair, although most villagers still say they will use their recently
received privatisation vouchers.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Russia (4): The voucher-led revolution - The
emergence of a new class of shopkeepers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN radicals' reform rhetoric sits uneasily alongside the rather
messy and unsatisfactory reality, with one notable exception: the
government's mass privatisation programme.
If an economic revolution has truly begun in the former Soviet Union, which
many doubt, the driving forces propelling it forward are the mass auctions
of small-scale state enterprises, and, more recently, the sale of shares in
medium and large-scale enterprises to their managers, workers and the
general public.
'Privatisation itself is the creation of a Russian bourgeoisie,' said Mr
Anatoli Chubais, the deputy prime minister with responsibility for the
privatisation programme in a recent interview. With more than 33,000
small-scale former state enterprises auctioned off to new owners last year,
about half the total employing fewer than one hundred employees, the
creation of a new class of Russian shop-keepers is under way.
Officials at the headquarters of GKI (GosKomImushchestvo) - the state
property committee managing the privatisation programme - say sales this
year suggest that the momentum behind the small-scale auctions may be
slowing. The best enterprises have already been sold, while the continuing
confusion over the privatisation of land and real estate are making life
difficult for new small businesses.
Maxim Boiko, a senior adviser to Mr Chubais, points to the proliferation of
street kiosks selling imported goods on the streets of Moscow and many other
large cities as evidence of the appetite for private enterprise and
obstacles to future progress. 'The kiosks are a good thing,' he says. 'But
they also indicate that the real estate market is not working.'
But while the small-scale effort has wearied, the privatisation baton has
been handed on. Last summer, the government announced it would auction
medium and large-scale state enterprises by issuing vouchers to the general
public by the end of the year.
In December, when voucher auctions for medium and large-scale companies
began with the sale of Moscow's Bolshevik cake factory, 18 companies were
sold. In April, 558 enterprises in 54 regions were up for tender. The
reformers' target of 5,000 sales by the end of the year is beginning to look
realistic.
In total, 1,547 of the 26,000 companies which employ more than 200 workers
or have assets valued over Rbs1m, had been sold by the end of April. Of
these, 372 enterprises employ more than 1,000 employees and account for 86
per cent of total employment in privatised enterprises.
Most privatised enterprises are largely owned by the workers and managers,
who generally choose to exercise their right to purchase 51 per cent of the
available shares. A further 30 per cent of equity is sold to the general
public using voucher auctions while the state generally retains a minority
stake.
Russians in most regions have been issued with rouble privatisation
'vouchers', which have a nominal face value of Rbs10,000 - a sum that can be
topped up with cash. The vouchers can be sold for cash, used to purchase
shares in their place of work, placed as a bid for a limited quantity of
shares in the companies during the two weeks they are up for sale at auction
houses in large cities, or 'invested' in one of the emerging investment
trusts which hold individual company shares on behalf of their investors.
Not surprisingly, privatisation has run into opposition from federal
bureaucrats and parliamentarians who have most to lose from the sale of
state assets. Prime minister Victor Chenomyrdin has been especially sharp in
his criticism of the programme. Rumours that Mr Chubais is about to be
sacked constantly circulate in Moscow and the provinces.
IN the regions, however, governments - and to a less extent local
parliaments - are increasingly supporting the Chubais programme, with 71
regions, out of about 90, organising auctions this month.
In Volgograd, 600 miles south of Moscow, Mr Konstantin Ogloblin is the
director of the state property fund that sells property on behalf of the
local GKI. He was appointed by, and answers to, the local oblast parliament
but is unequivocal in his support for voucher privatisation.
The biggest problem he faces is opposition from the federal property fund,
appointed by the Russian parliament in theory to sell federal property on
behalf of the GKI, but in practice is an attempt to slow the privatisation
process.
'We agree much more with the central GKI than the central property fund,' Mr
Ogloblin says, explaining that if the federal fund does not act fast enough
to sell off the enterprises then the GKI has the power to take control over
them. Despite federal opposition, the Volgograd fund has managed to sell off
a number of large factories, including the giant Volgograd tractor factory
with 26,000 employees. 'We advertised the sale of the tractor factory in the
central fund bulletin,' laughs Mr Ogloblin.
Yet the mass voucher privatisation programme does not receive universal
support from reformers. Critics, including the reform economist Grigory
Yavlinsky, doubt that privatisation will produce either new investment or
restructuring, particularly if worker-shareholders prevent managers from
laying off surplus workers.
Sergey Alexashenko, director of the Russian union of industrialists and
entrepreneurs and a reform sympathiser, agrees: 'In my opinion the
government has not chosen the right way,' he says. 'The main aim should not
be rapid privatisation but effective privatisation. We need effective owners
who exercise control over their enterprises. Voucher privatisation is a
mistake because it is completely ineffective.'
At the heart of the debate is the uncertainty about the nature of the
property rights that have notionally been transfered from the state to
shareholders. In theory, the management has the right to sack workers,
shareholders have the right to sack management, and new domestic investors,
perhaps with foreign partners, can take control by buying out existing
shareholders.
IN practice, the managers remain firmly in control of the newly privatised
enterprises - no factory directors have lost their jobs. Anecdotal reports
suggest that lay-offs occur but only rarely. And while foreign investment
banks are believed to be buying up parcels of shares in enterprises, they
have not yet attempted to exercise the property rights these shares
theoretically represent.
'Privatisation is a step in the direction of private firms,' says one senior
World Bank official in Moscow. 'But even in five years these 'privatised'
enterprises are not going to look like western companies.'
Officials at GKI accept that the next few years will produce new problems as
these newly acquired property rights become better understood, traded and
tested. But they argue that such criticisms miss the point.
In its early stages, the aims of the mass privatisation programme are
primarily political: to undermine the power of federal bureaucrats while
building a mass constituency of shareholders who have a stake in the
continuation of reform. 'In a limited number of cases, privatisation is
allowing people who have ideas about restructuring to get on with it,' says
Jonathan Hay, a western adviser based at the GKI in Moscow. 'But the
separation of the state and industry is the only realistic thing that
privatisation can achieve in the short-term.'
The reformers point to the support for economic reforms in President Boris
Yeltsin's recent referendum, and the opposition of federal bureaucrats, as
evidence that this strategy is working - 'privatisation is about taking away
the assets that federal bureaucrats used to control,' says Maxim Boiko. 'No
wonder they are not co-operative.'
Anecdotal evidence suggests that, with a typical mixture of enthusiasm and
cynicism, the Russian population is prepared to give this new capitalist
'game' a go, although the fact that the market value of privatisation
vouchers hovers around half their face value suggests they are prepared for
disappointment.
Interrupted while filling out an application form in the Volgograd auction
house and asked why she was buying shares, 20-year-old Lena Bruzgunova
reacted sharply: 'What would you do if you were given a voucher?' she asks.
And what can she expect in return for it?
'The voucher is too little,' she replies, 'But maybe the shares will pay
some interest some day. Privatisation may stop in a few months, but it may
be the basis of our future. We don't know what the future holds.'

Inequalities emerge and risks are high as the private sector economy
develops

<TEXT>
DESPITE the chaos, confusion and acrimony which continually dog the
government's halting attempt to embrace market reforms, Russia's economic
transformation is under way.
Accelerating economic and social change is readily apparent in the bustling
street markets and newly fitted office blocks, both in Moscow and regional
urban centres. But signs of this emerging private sector economy have yet to
be reflected in the government's state-sector dominated economic statistics.
Indeed, a casual glance at the official economic record would suggest that
the Russian economy has stood still or even moved backwards over the past
year:
Measured industrial output fell by 18.6 per cent last year and may still be
falling;
Inflation continues to fluctuate between 20 and 30 per cent a month as the
government and central bank pump out credits to loss-making state
enterprises at very low interest rates;
There are few signs of the unemployment and bankruptcies which many
observers believe will be needed if industry is to be restructured;
The domestic oil price is still less than a third of world prices, while
other energy prices are even lower; and
Measured living standards per head fell by a half in 1992 compared to the
previous year, with the hardest hit being pensioners and other people who
depend on state incomes. Since 1985, the average pension has fallen by a
quarter relative to the average wage.
But the statistics omit an important element of the Russian economic story:
the growth of an unofficial, unmeasured, often anarchic, but increasingly
significant private economy, which appears to be liberating a vibrant,
entrepreneurial streak in a growing number of Russian citizens.
This new activity is not restricted to the capital city alone, although
Moscow is, not surprisingly, ahead of the rest of the country. Street
markets, private banks, unofficial taxi services, new restaurants and stores
selling imported goods are springing-up across the republic.
The growth of this private economy has been encouraged by the liberalisation
of most state-controlled prices last year; the privatisation of over 33,000
small-scale state enterprises in 1992; the government's nascent medium and
large-scale privatisation programme; the removal of many state regulations
on private activity; the withering away of the state's ability to enforce
those regulations which remain; and the seizure and exploitation of state
assets and resources by managers, workers and local bureaucrats.
Russia is, as a result, developing a dual economy: a state industrial
sector, biased towards military production, weakened by the collapse of
trade between Russia and the other republics, dependent on government
subsidies for its survival, but responsible for social infrastructure and
the employment of the mass of the population; and an unofficial, sometimes
illegal, private economy in which most agents are engaged in trade and the
provision of services, rather than production, and in which much of the
economy's Dollars 35-40bn annual export earnings circulate.
The activities of the state sector dominate the official production
statistics and the state budget. Experts at international financial
institutions estimate that the government distributed explicit budget
subsidies equivalent to a little over 20 per cent of gross domestic product
last year, mainly to state enterprises. But the same amount again was paid
to enterprises through off-budget credits from the central bank and the
ministry of finance, channelled through the state banking system at very low
interest rates.
But it is the new private sector, emerging from the black economy of the
former Soviet union and reminiscent of the wild capitalism of nineteenth
century America, which seems to be the main dynamic force that generates and
distributes wealth throughout the economy. This unofficial economy is
serviced by the mushrooming, unregulated private banking system, whose
growing wealth and power is illustrated by the large number of
advertisements for Russian banks, paid for in dollars, which appear in this
survey.
The activities of Inkombank, a new Moscow-based private bank, are typical of
this new private sector. Inkombank has assets equivalent to 212bn roubles,
of which 70 per cent are held as hard currency. The bulk of its activity
consists of finance of commodity exports through its network of
correspondent banks abroad, explains Alexey Kuznetsov, the bank's smart,
young first deputy chairman - 'we finance exports of fertilisers, copper,
aluminium, arms, lumber and construction materials and refined oil,' he
says.
This private, un-regulated economy has space for many smaller fish. Some are
official privatised companies, a sample of which appear later in this
survey. Others are individuals who do extra work in addition to, or instead
of, official jobs. Vladim, a 28 year-old Moscovite, fluent in English and
Italian, earns 18,000 roubles (Dollars 19) a month from teaching. But he
supplements these meagre earnings from taxi driving, at which he can earn
Dollars 20 a day and pays Dollars 60 a month to the local 'mafia', who
control taxi access at the Olympic Penta hotel.
The growth of this unofficial economy partly explains how the government has
been able to maintain support for reform, despite rampant inflation and
falling real wages - 'people do not care too much about their wages,' ways
one senior western official based in Moscow. 'Much of the important economic
activity now occurs outside the wage economy.'
But this dollar-based economy means a growing gap in income and living
standards between those with the power and influence to take, and flaunt,
their share of this new wealth and those who remain dependent on the state
sector for their livelihood. It has also meant growing public resentment of
the associated corruption and illegality.
'Pensioners are not primarily concerned with how badly off they are, or how
hungry,' says social affairs minister Ella Pamfilova. 'Price increases are
only their second priority. Their biggest concern is crime and corruption.'
The government's problem has been to manage the political reaction to this
growing inequality and lawlessness, while keeping the reforms on track. Over
the past year, it appears to have managed the former at the expense of the
latter. Support for reform remains surprisingly strong, boosted perhaps by
the populist mass privatisation programme. But that is partly because the
government, or at least the relevant ministers in the increasingly divided
cabinet of ministers, have failed to take the tough decisions needed to
bring inflation under control.
The reformers have tried to pin the blame for inflation on Mr Viktor
Gerashchenko, the central bank governor, who has been portrayed as an enemy
within, recklessly flooding the economy with inflationary credit. His
stubborn insistence on supplying credits to other former Soviet republics,
to the tune of 10 per cent of Russian GDP in 1992, has certainly made
controlling inflation very difficult. Many reformers argue that Mr Boris
Fyodorov, the finance minister, should take over the central bank governor's
job.
But the responsibility for high and rising inflation belongs as much to the
government. For cutting state subsidies to state enterprises, however
necessary and desirable, means bankruptcies, unemployment and the risk of
social discontent.
Unemployment benefits are minimal, less than a fifth of the average wage,
while many social benefits are still provided by enterprises. In these
circumstances, neither the government nor the central bank have been
prepared to ignore parliamentary opposition and start to cut state
subsidies.
'The central bank should be responsible for monetary policy while the
bankruptcies of state enterprises are a matter for the government,' says Mr
Alexander Khandruyev, a deputy governor at the central bank.
'But if we simply stop credit emissions, then our government would face mass
strikes tomorrow.'
The result has been rapid inflation. Total credit grew, as a result, by
3,140 per cent over the course of last year while prices rose by 2,500 per
cent. The government had some success in raising tax revenue, particularly
from the value-addded tax which now accounts for a third of revenue
collected. But on- and off-budget credits accounted for 40 per cent of GDP
last year.
If anything, the government has moved further away from controlling its
budget deficit in recent months.
Recent monetary data had been relatively encouraging, with the monthly
inflation rate falling to 21 per cent in March from 26 per cent in February
and the growth of central bank credit dropping into single figures. But a
rise in government spending and bank credits in the weeks preceding the
referendum are expected to push inflation back towards 30 per cent over the
next few months.
Mr Sergie Vassiliev, director of the government's Centre for Economic
Reform, confirms that government demands for credits from the central bank
increased in the weeks before the referendum - 'thirty per cent monthly
inflation reflects the government's inability to control its expenditures,'
says Mr Vassiliev.
The central bank and government had agreed in early April that credit
emission in the second quarter should be limited to 3,000bn roubles, of
which 1,300bn roubles would go to the government's budget. But the
consequence of pre-referendum pledges to raise the paltry level of pensions
and the minimum wage, and increase in subsidies to the agricultural and
energy sectors, mean that the government deficit is already expected to be
2,300bn roubles.
The government's failure to curb inflation is therefore a direct result of
its desire to avoid the harsh distributional consequences of imposing tough
budget contraints on the state enterprises, many of which would be bankrupt.
But the resulting inflation is proving to be both an obstacle to reform and
inegalitarian, for two reasons.
First, the inflationary credits are not tied to industrial restructuring and
thus allow the state enterprises to avoid commercial realities. So long as
state enterprises continue to receive credits at negative real interest
rates, they face no incentive or necessity to restructure.
According to various western financial institutions, neither macroeconomic
stabilisation nor enterprises restructuring can proceed without a
rationalisation and reduction in the volume of state subsidies.
Second, high and unstable inflation is one reason why the flow of investment
into Russia has so far been negligible. No sensible investor wants to hold
rouble assets.
The result is an artificially low exchange rate, falling towards 1,000
roubles per dollar, which leaves the average wage equal to a mere Dollars 30
a month and makes imported goods too expensive for most citizens.
The reformers are relying on western aid to square the circle by
substituting western budget support for inflationary central bank credits.
The government's financial programme envisages that total available credit
will fall from 40 per cent in 1992 to 17 per cent of GDP by the final
quarter of this year. But total domestic credit falls to 7.2 per cent of
GDP, consistent with a monthly inflation rate of 5 per cent, while western
aid fills the gap.
Western officials appear increasingly sympathetic. Officials from the Group
of Seven industrialised countries say they are determined not to see a
repeat of last year, when much of the original Dollars 24bn aid package was
not disbursed because the Russian government was unable to meet the IMF's
tough financial conditions. At their meeting in Tokyo four weeks ago, the G7
foreign and finance ministers announced a headline figure of nearly Dollars
44bn of assistance to Russia over the next year from the IMF, the World Bank
and in bilateral aid.
Senior officials at the group of seven industrialised countries envisage
that budget support could become available over the next few weeks following
recent negotiations between the reformers and the International Monetary
Fund.
The IMF is now offering each former Soviet republic fast disbursing aid -
labelled a 'systemic transformation facility' - half of which would be paid
immediately to any government demonstrating a 'credible' reform strategy.
For Russia this facility will provide Dollars 3bn.
G7 officials list four key conditions which should be met before funds can
be released:
Strict limits on central bank credit creation;
A rise in interest rates;
Significant reductions in all state subsidies;
A viable budget programme that is consistent with low inflation.
By helping the government to manage its distributional dilemma, the western
hopes to help the reformers fight off the threat of hyperinflation and start
the difficult process of restructuring and slimming the military sector,
while the nascent private economy continues to grow. The challenge for the
west is to ensure that aid does substitute for central bank credits, rather
than merely adding to their sum, and is closely tied to industrial
restructuring.
That, according to World Bank officials, means ensuring that general
subsidies are cut so that the social safety net supports the unemployed
rather than loss-making enterprises, while remaining subsidies to large
military enterprises are time-limited and linked to specific transformation
plans.
The G7 strategy is risky. Senior officials at both the World Bank and the
IMF fear that, however committed the reformers in Moscow, their inability to
control inflation combined with Russia's lack of market infrastructure mean
the western money will be wasted. They are worried that the reputations of
both the World Bank and the IMF will be damaged in the process.
Certainly, if aid is to materialise and reforms are to progress, the Russian
government will have to be considerably more bold, and willing to take
greater political risks than it has been in recent weeks during which
President Boris Yeltsin's economic appointments have seemed to suggest he is
less than fully committed to reform. But if it works, western aid might, in
the words of one senior western official, 'grease the wheels' of Russia's
economic transformation by 'buying time for the invisible hand to do the
work.'
By injecting dollars into the economy through government channels, the west
hopes to enable the reformers to control inflation and mitigate the growing
inequality that the developing private sector economy is bringing.
The risks are high - that is the nature of the G7's gamble.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Russia (1): Pressing ahead on the long road of

HOW one reads the progress of Russian reform in the past year is a matter of
the half full or half empty glass.
For those who prefer to point out that the glass is half empty, there is a
rich selection of horrors before which to shiver. Russia has not succeeded
in laying democratic foundations: it has neither a constitution commensurate
with the demands of a new state, nor strong political parties - and it has a
bitter, unresolved tension between the presidency and the parliament.
The lack of a constitution and the weakness of the central government means
that the republics and the regions within the federation are anarchically
claiming and taking power. The political stasis has enforced economic
timidity, as the cabinet - itself divided between conservatives, moderates
and radicals - stands transfixed in front of the massive tasks of
restructuring which it must undertake.
Foreign investment is negli-
gible and foreign confidence dropping because of a largely bad experience
with joint ventures and with direct investment. As the world's two most
populous states - China and India - move strongly towards more open
economies and attract mobile capital, Russia stands as a lonely outpost of
statism, immured in opaque struggles, unable to chart a consistent course,
the despair of the coalition of rich capitalist states which is trying to
help it, and with it the other former Soviet States.
It remains a nuclear arsenal, and has not yet ratified the Start II treaty
nor begun a wide-scale demobilisation of its vast army. It has a host of
tensions on its borders with the former Soviet republics - especially
nuclear-armed Ukraine, which has not even signed Start 1 and is increasingly
inclined to retain its warheads.
This is a bare selection: the nightmare can easily be rendered more lurid
with the addition of ecological disasters waiting to happen, increasing
impoverishment of vulnerable sections of the population and the rise of
fascist - and neo-communist - sentiment. But it requires the balance of the
half full perspective.
In this view, a blink-of-an-eye 18 months have passed since reforming
government started to construct a Russian state. In that time, the process
of state-building has been almost entirely peaceful: not only has there been
little violence, there have been few demonstrations (and these ill attended
in the main). A parliament functions, as does a presidency, in public view:
their arguments are fierce, but open - a rare experience for this country.
The press is free, often raucously so. Organisations defending and
furthering civil rights spring up constantly: the restrictions on domestic
and foreign travellers, for citizens and non-citizens alike, have largely
gone.
THE reforms instituted last year by a reform cabinet under Mr Yagor Gaidar
have meant that money and price now matter again, and that property is
beginning to acquire a meaning. Managers are being constrained to think
about making a profit - and consumers are beginning to feel able to demand
availability and quality. Neither now look only to the state to feed them.
The privatisation campaign, which picked up speed in the second half of last
year, has now seen half of the small businesses privatised.
Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy premier in charge of privatisation, predicts
that all will be off the state books by the end of this year, together with
5,000 medium and large-sized companies. The vouchers issued to all Russian
citizens, with which they can take part in privatisation through auctions,
have at least given them a stake and given the government a pro-market
constituency.
Finally, reform is still on the agenda. It is a rough road, but President
Boris Yeltsin is still on it, and he still protects a cabinet struggling to
further the market and to underpin democracy.
Mr Yeltsin is a deeply ambiguous figure: by turns courageous and
backsliding, clear and muddled, uncompromising and hesitant. Yet his gut
instinct for a more liberally inclined Russia has not deserted him and his
shaky popularity remains higher than that of any contender, including
populists like his vice president, General Alexander Rutskoi.
The change in Russia remains obvious in foreign policy - a change which
predates the disintegration of the Soviet Union but which has stood the test
of severe internal criticism from conservatives and nationalists.
ALTHOUGH it has been unable to solve its long-running territorial dispute
with Japan over the Kurile Islands, Russia has proved a strong supporter of
the UN majority line in the former Yugoslavia; it has generally retained
sanctions on Iraq and Libya; and it no longer provides aid and succour to
historic allies like Cuba.
This does not make the international crises less critical - there is an
argument it has made them more so by removing the element of bi-polar
stability - but it has given a greater scope for democratic development in
countries frozen in cold-war attitudes and alliances.
The key consideration is the likely durability of peaceful reform. Mr
Yeltsin passed the end of last year and the beginning of this in
increasingly impossible compromises with a parliament whose majority became
more and more opposed to the president and government - and who were able to
force Yegor Gaidar out of the leadership of the cabinet in December. Despite
this, he insisted on the holding of a referendum a month ago and won votes
of confidence in himself and his reform programme.
Since then, he has sought - not wholly convincingly yet - to capitalise on
these results, by giving a boost to the privatisation programme, sacking
some of the more conservative senior officials and getting agreement on a
reform plan between the Central Bank and the government ready for the
approval of the International Monetary Fund.
As this survey is written, the combat between him and his government and
other allies on the one side and the parliament and its allies on the other
is still in the wings: both have rallied round different versions of a
constitution which, broadly, would seek to mould the country into a
presidential or a parliamentary system.
Mr Yeltsin, with the backing of the security and defence ministries and with
wider powers of patronage, has retained the upper hand: the parliament is
again pressing for a compromise, while Mr Yeltsin's allies fear that such a
siren call may again enmesh the president in fruitless debate without an
outcome.
These fears are real, and their resolution is presently the highest task
facing Russia's leadership. Russia has not lost the reform road, and the
stolid patience of its people has been extraordinary. But nor has Russia
properly found the reform road: it is being surpassed by other states; and
its hold over the attention and purse strings of the developed world must
have limits.
Above all, it needs to construct normal, open and transparent relations with
the world from which it attempted to cut itself off during the Communist
period. Many of its business and political leader fear takeover and
expropriation by foreign interests and capital: these fears need to be both
calmed and faced, and the nature of international capital and division of
labour grasped and internalised to suit Russian conditions.
It has the advantage not just of a patient but of an educated and often
cultured people: a mineral-rich earth; an industrial culture; and,
presently, international goodwill. It could squander these before as it has
squandered them in the past: but for the first time in Russian and Soviet
history, the people appear strong enough not to allow it to happen.

FT  27 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Courtaulds surges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Relief that no rights issue arrived with the figures helped Courtaulds, the
chemicals group, to put on a sprightly performance yesterday. The shares
received added support from a merger announcement and jumped 19 to 541p.
The cash call rumour, which dominated trading in the stock on Tuesday,
apparently sprang from comments by the company before it went in to closed
season that the debt would hit Pounds 400m. Marketmakers who took the
speculation seriously had gone short of the shares. When they realised
Courtaulds had been over-cautious and the debt was only Pounds 220m there
was a scramble for stock.
The buying pressure was increased by an acceptable profit of Pounds 192.7m,
a comforting statement and news that Courtaulds is to merge its acrylics and
viscose division with Hoechst, of Germany, providing a competitive advantage
in a very tight area of the industry.
RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, advanced 18 to 669p after the
company's announcement of an enhanced scrip dividend and an early 1993
interim dividend payment of 13.5p per share.
Analysts said the shares also received support from BZW and UBS, but in the
afternoon Lehman Brothers cut its 1994 forecast by Pounds 39m to Pounds 966m
on the back of low copper price estimates. The house also pared its earnings
per share estimate by 9p to 51p.
A one-for-one share split for BAT Industries resulted in the stock closing 2
1/2 up at 419p in the new form. Very high turnover of 39m shares was linked
to the company's enhanced scrip scheme offering shares in place of cash
dividends.
Guinness shares reacted badly to comments made at the group's agm, closing 7
off at 460p. Drinks specialists said the warning of lower 1993 first-half
profits was largely known.
BP moved up 5 1/2 to 312p on news of a Pounds 250m management buyout of one
of the company's consumer products divisions and a good performance by oils
in the US overnight. Shell rose 4 to 614p.
A buy recommendation from Kleinwort Benson drove Lasmo 5 higher to 151p. The
broker rated the stock a 'short-term trading buy', citing short-term US
interest as likely to increase in the run-up to the full ADR listing
expected next month. Kleinwort also highlighted the group's drilling
operations in Colombia, adjacent to BP's Cusiana oil discovery, as likely to
heighten US interest in the shares.
Clyde Petroleum, up 3 more at 54p, continued to attract heavy two-way
activity, with big institutions said to be chasing the stock as a number of
important drilling operations get under way. Clyde's current and future
operations include drilling in Syria, Malaysia and the Yemen.
After lagging behind BT and Cable and Wireless for the past two sessions,
Vodafone raced ahead 8 1/2 to 427 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 5.8m, boosted
by strong US buying.
A buy recommendation from Kleinwort Benson ahead of today's annual meeting
boosted international trading group Inchcape. The shares jumped 16 to 576p
with volume reaching 2.3m. Williams Holdings bounced 4 to 314p after NatWest
Securities urged investors to buy.
US buyers were active in Tiphook, the shares rising 12 to 311p. APV put on 4
at 97p, with SG Warburg said to have been positive.
News from Rolls-Royce that it expects little improvement in trading
conditions over the next two years dented sentiment in the aerospace sector.
The stock, sustained by bargain hunters, eased only a penny to 144p on 7m
turnover.
Sentiment from Rolls-Royce weakened Smiths Industries, 3 lighter at 342p,
and FR Group, which shed 4 to 258p.
British Aerospace fell on the Rolls-Royce statement but recovered to close
unchanged at 325p. The Pounds 57.6m that BAe said it was repaying for the
illegal government aid it received for its 1988 purchase of Rover was not as
high as feared.
Pilkington eased a penny to 133p on turnover of 3.4m shares on worries of
more troubling news following recent high-level suspensions at the company's
US arm.
The resignation of Mr James Tyrrell as finance director of Abbey National
and his appointment as group finance director at London International Group
saw Abbey dip 3 to 415p and LIG add 5 at 186p.
Reckitt &amp; Colman was squeezed 16 higher to 558p on slim turnover. Paterson
Zochonis, the branded soap manufacturer, rose 13 apiece in the 'A' stock to
398p and in the ordinary to 448p after a small agency cross in the 'A'
shares to 397p.

FT  27 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Barclays boosted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stockbroker Hoare Govett was the driving force behind the good showing by
Barclays Bank shares. Hoare's banks team upgraded its current year profits
forecast from Pounds 350m to Pounds 550m, because of what it sees as a
continuing improvement in the bank's operating performance.
'We see the bank's bad debts substantially lower this year,' said Mr Steven
Thorn at Hoare. He rates Barclays shares '20 per cent cheaper than those of
National Westminster and with better dividend growth prospects', and told
clients to switch out of NatWest and into Barclays.
Barclays shares continued the rehabilitation which began after the group
upset the market by halving the final dividend and reporting deeply
disappointing results in March. The stock price, which plummeted to 392p
after the dividend cut, touched 462p yesterday before coming off the top to
close 2 firmer at 459p on keen turnover of 5.1m.

FT  27 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: N West Water rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
North West Water's surprise move in proposing an enhanced scrip dividend at
a level 50 per cent above the cash dividend equivalent saw its stock price
race ahead, triggering a general advance in the water sector as dealers
quickly decided that other water companies may propose similar schemes.
Shares in North West, the first water company to report preliminary figures,
climbed 7 to 487p on heavy turnover of 4.6m after the scrip news,
preliminary results and 9 per cent increase in the dividend. Dividend
increases averaging 9 per cent have been forecast for the sector by
utilities specialists. Turnover was boosted by a block of 1.3m shares
thought to have been sold in special ex-dividend form.
Some analysts, however, cast doubts on whether other water companies will
follow the path of enhanced scrip offerings. 'For companies such as North
West, which has an aggressive expansion programme, this is a good move, but
the only other water company which fits the bill is Thames,' was the view of
one analyst.
Thames shares rose 7 to 508p, but heavily underperformed smaller capitalised
companies such as Southern, up 16 1/2 at 497p, and South West, reporting
today, 13 higher at 520p.

FT  27 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters finds US support
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENTHUSIASTIC support for Reuters Holdings from the US led to a sharp rise in
the share price of the news and electronic dealing group. There was added
support ahead of a key foreign exchange dealers' meeting next week.
The UK market learned yesterday afternoon that Goldman Sachs had repeated
its strong buy recommendation. New York-based Mr Eric Philo said the company
had confirmed that its core foreign exchange business was improving and its
new Dealing 2000-2 automated trading system was close to achieving 1,000
trades a day. Mr Philo predicts earnings per share of up to 88.2p and a
share price as high as Pounds 17 within the next 12 months.
Also, dealers throughout the world are to meet in Helsinki next Thursday for
an annual foreign exchange meeting expected to be bullish for Reuters. The
shares, reacting to the US-quoted ADRs, jumped 44 to 1352p with 1.1m traded.

FT  27 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity gains extended in steady trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GOOD response to yest-erday's Pounds 3bn auction of government bonds
helped UK equities extend this week's recovery, although trading volume
remained unexciting. Once again, it was left to a handful of selected stocks
to provide the features as well as the backbone of the FT-SE 100 Index. A
batch of large deals after the official close featured a 9 per cent stake in
Trade Indemnity, the corporate insurer, sold at 47p a share, and also 5.8m
shares in British Gas and large blocks of Prudential, Guardian Royal
Exchange and GEC.
The early part of the session saw share prices moving narrowly, often
responding to stock index futures. Equities turned firmer when the outcome
of the gilt-edged auction was disclosed, although they waited for a clear
lead from bond prices before edging higher. A further boost came when New
York opened firmly, moving further above a testing level.
The stock market closed at the day's best, with the final reading of 2,846.9
on the FT-SE 100 leaving a gain of 9.2. While there was no rush of buying,
Seaq volume increased in the final hour to record a daily total of 626.8m
shares; Tuesday's 591.2m was worth Pounds 1.29bn in retail business.
Second line issues followed slowly in the wake of the blue chips. At the
close, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index was 2.8 ahead at a new peak of 3,175.5.
Non-Footsie business made up around 53 per cent of the day's Seaq turnover.
The success of the gilt-edged auction and firmness in sterling revived some
of the more optimistic hopes for a reduction in UK base rates, in spite of
yesterday's absence of change in German repurchase rates. But few UK market
strategists expect a rate cut within six weeks or so; any hopes for an
earlier cut are 'thinly based', commented Mr Richard Kersley at BZW, who
sees little economic evidence to support them.
Attention was also paid in the market to growing hints that Mr John Major
plans to reshuffle the members of his government, perhaps this weekend.
Overall, however, strategists found little reason yesterday to reformulate
their views on the outlook for UK equities. There was some relief that the
gilts auction was now out of the way in a stock market where lack of
institutional liquidity has become a significant problem. Rights issues now
total around Pounds 5.5bn this year.
The Footsie is still rooted firmly in the middle of its trading range, with
little indication yet that confidence in economic recovery has become strong
enough to call for a rerating of equities. However, the lower end of the
range, at around Footsie 2,790, is now seen as a more reliable basis for the
market rebound when it comes.
The gloom overhanging the brewery sector deepened after the annual meeting
of shareholders at Guinness disappointed traders. Store and consumer stocks
tried to edge ahead at the close.
The Footsie was helped by firmness in the oil sector as both blue chips and
second line energy shares benefited from a series of largely unrelated
corporate developments. The banking and property sectors appeared to brush
off the misfortunes of Speyhawk, the City of London developer which went
into receivership this week.

<TEXT>
THE derivatives sector traded firmly in response to the successful UK gilts
auction and suggestions of a reduction in UK base rates, although volume
remained thin, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, trading in the June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index opened at
2,844, just below its previous finish, and initially fell back to 2,836 on a
sizeable selling order.
That done, the contract regained strength and moved ahead, boosted by the
outcome of the gilts auction and the speculation on interest rate cuts.
A firm Wall Street ensured that June continued to move forward, although the
absence of leading institutions from the day's main action meant that volume
remained low.
Having reached the day's high of 2,857 just ahead of the official close,
June finished at 2,854, up 10 from its previous close and 2 points above its
fair value premium to cash of 5. Volume was 6,843 lots.
In traded options, turnover was also poor, reaching 25,795 contracts. Just
over a third of the total was dealt in the index options, the FT-SE 100
option trading 6,644 and the Euro FT-SE option 3,275 lots.
Hanson was the busiest stock option on 2,023 lots transacted, with the
August 260 calls the most active series. It was followed by Argyll at 1,204,
with the majority of the trading done in the July 330 puts. ICI, Guinness
and RTZ were also active.

FT  27 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Falling bond yields lift Dow
to record high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER TRADING most of the day in a narrow range, US share prices pushed into
record territory late in the session after bond yields fell decisively back
through the 7 per cent level, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 23.53 stronger at
3,540.16, eclipsing the previous record close of 3,523.28 set a week ago.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 advanced 4.59 to 453.44, while
the American SE composite finished 3.06 higher at a record 437.13 and the
Nasdaq composite up 9.05 at 704.09. New York SE volume totalled 279m shares.
The markets opened with prices edging forward across the board in subdued
trading. Investor sentiment was affected by more bad news on the economy.
Analysts had been expecting durable goods orders to have risen by between 1
per cent and 1.5 per cent last month, but they were unchanged in April. The
figures suggested yet again that the economy is struggling to make headway
after its unsustainably strong final quarter of 1992.
Fortunately for equities, bond prices continued to climb, buoyed by the poor
economic data, falling metal and commodity prices, and a strong five-year
note auction. By late afternoon the benchmark 30-year government bond was up
a full point, and the yield was down to just above 6.9 per cent. The sharp
drop in yields spurred late buying of stocks.
Compaq forged ahead Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 59 1/2 after a senior executive
at the computer company made promising noises about second-quarter earnings
prospects.
Other big computer stocks also strengthened, IBM appreciating Dollars 2 3/8
to Dollars 52 3/4 , Digital Equipment Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 45 1/4 and
Hewlett-Packard Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 86 1/4 .
Conner Peripherals declined Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 12 in heavy trading
after the company warned that it might make an operating loss in the third
quarter.
Banking and motor issues were in strong demand. BankAmerica put on Dollars 1
at Dollars 45 3/8 , Chemical Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 39 1/4 and Chase
Manhattan Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 31 5/8 , while Chrysler climbed Dollars 1
to Dollars 44 3/8 and Ford Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 52 5/8 .
T2, boosted in recent days by speculation that a management-led group is
planning to take over the company, relinquished some of its gain yesterday
amid growing doubts about the deal. The stock retreated Dollars 1 7/8 to
Dollars 15.
On the Nasdaq market, Novell was a rare weak spot, falling Dollars 2 3/8 to
Dollars 29 7/8 in volume of 13m shares after two brokerage houses downgraded
the stock following disappointing quarterly results.
Canada
TORONTO closed with a mildly firmer bias after active trading. The TSE 300
index was up 5.3 at 3,865.2 and advances outnumbered declines by 383 to 321
after volume of 77.07m shares valued at CDollars 701m.
Among the sub-indices, eight of the 14 increased. Transportation climbed
2.87 per cent as Laidlaw 'B' rose CDollars  3/8 to CDollars 10 7/8 . The
gold shares sector fell 1.92 per cent.
Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia and National Trustco reported higher
second-quarter earnings. Bank of Montreal firmed CDollars  1/8 to CDollars
26 3/8 and Scotiabank was unchanged at CDollars 25 5/8 , as was National
Trustco at CDollars 18 3/4.

FT  27 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Venezuelan equities face an uncertain
outlook - Joseph Mann considers the issues and prospects following the
suspension from office of Mr Perez
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If 1992 was a bad year for Venezuela's equity market, 1993 is not shaping up
to be much better.
Since early last year, political upheaval and continued uncertainty over
future economic policies, together with high domestic interest rates, have
hurt the performance of the Caracas stock exchange.
For most of this year the stock exchange has been in the doldrums. The index
dropped to a 26-month low on March 17 and showed only a modest recovery
until April 26, when equity prices jumped 11.1 per cent the day after Mr
Oswaldo Alvarez Paz was chosen as presidential candidate by the Christian
Democratic Copei party.
Recently, share prices have been volatile. Last week's decision by the
senate to suspend President Carlos Andres Perez over allegations of
corruption had little obvious effect on the market which, since then, has
improved by some 1.5 per cent. However, this compares with a fall of more
than 10 per cent in early May on a rumour that Mr Perez had resigned.
In contrast, the index saw a one-day increase of 11 per cent, the largest on
record, in April after Copei, the main opposition party, chose a free market
advocate as its presidential candidate for elections scheduled for December.
This latter performance helped Venezuela register the second best April rise
in dollar terms among the world's emerging markets, according to data
supplied by the IFC, part of the World Bank.
However, the market still remains 8 per cent down on the year. Equities have
had to compete against unusually high real interest rates, with some
commercial banks offering more than 60 per cent per annum on short-term
deposits in a country where inflation is expected to range between 30 to 35
per cent this year, against 32 per cent in 1992.
The Venezuelan government recently tried to encourage a decline in domestic
interest rates by reducing the yields of key government debt instruments
sold on the domestic market. However, commercial rates have not yet shown
any significant response.
The administration, which initiated unpopular economic reforms at the
beginning of its five-year term, deserves the credit for promoting three
years of economic growth.
However, last year the oil-exporting republic was shaken by two unsuccessful
coups d'etat and months of related political turmoil.
For 1993, the political outlook remains confused, with Mr Perez facing
impeachment when he appears before the supreme court, a case which could
stretch into 1994.
This year began with rumours of another military uprising and the
uncertainties of a presidential campaign in which some of the major
candidates have attacked the free-market policies of Mr Perez.
Investors are now concerned over what interim president Mr Octavio Lepage
will do.
The country's political crises have developed during a time of strong
economic growth. Unemployment has fallen sharply and foreign investment is
strong, but the government has been unable to push inflation below 30 per
cent.
This year the government is forecasting growth of between 3.9 and 5 per
cent. But until the political situation settles down the country cannot
expect steady economic and social progress.

FT  27 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average climbs by
1.2 per cent

EQUITIES climbed 1.2 per cent on institutional buying in spite of the yen's
advance against the dollar, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average ended 264.23 higher at 20,895.99, after dipping to a
day's low of 20,527.96. The Topix index rose 21.43 to 1,639.72 and in London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 7.43 at 1,263.87.
Volume was 470m shares compared to Tuesday's 437m, while rises led falls by
743 to 292, with 152 issues unchanged.
Brokers said some investors had bought shares on speculation that the yen's
rise against the dollar would encourage the Bank of Japan to cut interest
rates. The yen closed at Y108.65 to the dollar in Tokyo.
However, an analyst at a Japanese securities house said that equity markets
had already discounted foreign exchange rate considerations. The yen, he
added, is expected to weaken during the latter half of this year.
The banking sector was strong after long-term credit banks increased their
prime lending rates: Industrial Bank of Japan moved ahead Y140 to Y2,880 and
Mitsubishi Bank Y100 to Y2,680.
Brokerages benefited from the buying interest in banking issues: Nomura rose
Y60 to Y2,180, Nikko Y50 to Y1,120, Daiwa Y50 to Y1,340 and Nikko Y50 to
Y1,120.
Keisei Electric Railway moved Y20 higher to Y1,350 on a report that its
affiliate, Oriental Land - which runs Tokyo Disneyland - and Walt Disney, of
the US, had agreed to build another theme park in Tokyo.
Investors bought the shares of some cement companies on suggestions that an
imminent passage of the supplementary budget by the lower house will
translate into more public works projects and a revival of the cement
industry. Sumitomo appreciated Y19 to Y652 and Onada Y23 to Y667.
Profit-taking pushed TDK, the world's largest manufacturer of magnetic
tapes, Y130 lower to Y3,810, partly on its recent 43 per cent drop in
pre-tax profits and partly on the day's rise in the yen.
In Osaka, the OSE average added 91.10 at 22,902.92 in volume of 28.4m
shares.
Roundup
THE ANTIPODES provided more new highs for the region.
AUSTRALIA climbed to a 43-month peak, gold shares again showing the
strongest gains as the firmer Australian dollar, and rises in most resource
stocks, left the All Ordinaries index 20.1 higher at 1,717.4.
Turnover expanded from ADollars 293m to ADollars 346.6m. The gold shares
index surged 70.3 to 1,869.3, its best level since February 1990, as some
brokers said that gold bullion, currently at USDollars 378.75 an ounce,
could reach USDollars 400.
Plutonic Resources leaped 94 cents to ADollars 5.75 after reporting a second
significant new prospect, Goldfish, in Western Australia.
NEW ZEALAND scraped to a new record in busy trading, but ended off the day's
high due to late profit-taking. The NZSE-40 index was finally 2.92 firmer at
1,640.54 in turnover up from NZDollars 31.5m to NZDollars 45.0m
KARACHI rose strongly towards the close ahead of a decision by the supreme
court to reinstate the national assembly and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
This overturns the dissolution of parliament by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan
last month. The KSE index put on 7.45 at 1,142.12.
Mr Muddassar Malik, director of BMA Capital Management in Karachi, commented
that the outlook for equities was positive and forecast a 3 to 5 per cent
rise in the index over the next few days.
HONG KONG saw profit-taking and the Hang Seng index slipped 17.31 to
7,350.87.
SINGAPORE reported interest in selected blue chips as the Straits Times
Industrial index advanced 7.90 to 1,868.64.
MANILA extended Tuesday's gains, the composite index ending 16.21 higher at
1,608.85 as turnover rose from 148.4m pesos to 175.2m pesos.

to 3,999.

<TEXT>
BOURSE indices mostly moved a few points either way yesterday, the FT-SE
Eurotrack moving from slightly better in the morning to slightly worse in
the afternoon, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT found nothing positive to bite on, Baden-Wurttemberg's inflation
rate coming in at 4.1 per cent against Tuesday's 3.9 per cent from North
Rhine-Westphalia, the D-Mark continuing to soften and the Bundesbank leaving
repo rates unchanged.
The DAX index closed 3.82 higher at 1,622.00 as turnover rose from DM4.5bn
to DM5.0bn. Strength in the big three chemicals balanced weakness in the
automotive sector where Continental, which announced a warrant bond issue on
Tuesday, incorporated that afternoon's post bourse weakness to close DM6.60
lower on the official session at DM192.
Volkswagen dropped another DM4.70 to DM310.70 on the row between Mr Ignacio
Lopez and his former employer, General Motors.
PARIS mulled over details of the government's privatisation package, the
CAC-40 index moving narrowly before settling just 0.66 lower at 1,890.43.
Turnover was moderate at FFr2.3bn. There are hopes of a further easing in
French interest rates in the near future, helped by continued strength in
the franc.
Contained among the privatisation proposals, set to become law by the end of
June, is one ending the 20 per cent ceiling on foreign ownership.
Construction stocks benefitted from expectations of an upturn in the sector
flowing from the government's plans to develop infrastructure projects.
Lafarge advanced FFr11.40 or 3.4 per cent to FFr352.90 and Bouygues FFr11 to
FFr664.
LVMH slid FFr48 to FFr3,588 following a profits warning from Guinness, while
profit-taking was noted in Casino, down FFr3.40 or 2.5 per cent at FFr134.50
and Schneider, off FFr21 or 3 per cent at FFr669.
ZURICH's SMI index closed 3.2 higher at 2,247.0. In banking, UBS ended SFr9
higher at SFr977 on foreign buying. Elsewhere in the blue chips, Nestle's
SFr20 drop to SFr1,120 preceded the setting of its rights issue price at
SFr800 per registered share.
MADRID was dampened down by a sharp weakening of the peseta but the general
index, 0.43 higher at 259.33, made a new high for the year. Turnover was
around Pta22.8bn, against Pta24.6bn on Tuesday.
BRUSSELS rose in spite of a further, 2.2 per cent dip in Solvay, BFr250
lower at BFr11,150, on its planned closure of two soda ash plants. The
Bel-20 index closed 4.42 higher at 1,195.35 in turnover of BFr819m.
The steelmaker, Arbed, and the shipper, CMB, were the day's leading gainers.
The glassmaker, Glaverbel, fell BFr200, or 6.5 per cent to BFr2,900 after it
predicted a big loss in the first half of 1993.
MILAN continued to ease as some investors took profits, while further
evidence of problems at Fiat dampened overall sentiment.
The carmaker has asked the government for permission to make additional
temporary lay-offs at its plants which will be subsidised by the state. The
shares fixed down L195 or 2.9 per cent at L6,351 and eased another L100 on
the kerb. IFI, the holding company, lost L580 to L13,420.
The Comit index lost 6.56 to 551.99. SME lost L28 to L6,586 after announcing
an unchanged dividend of L110 on its 1992 results.
AMSTERDAM was slightly stronger helped by the rise in the dollar. The CBS
Tendency index rose 0.4 to 106.5.
Among the day's gainers KNP BT, the paper, packaging and printing equipment
group, rose 40 cents to Fl 29.00 in spite of announcing a slight loss for
the first quarter of 1993.
Nutricia recovered some of Tuesday's losses, up Fl 2.00 at Fl 124.30.
STOCKHOLM saw a 3 per cent fall in the forestry sector depress overall
activity. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 5.2 to 1,090.6 in turnover of
SKr1.3bn.
MoDo, which reported a first quarter loss of SKr200m after Tuesday's close,
saw its B shares fall SKr17 to SKr242 while SCA, which yesterday reported a
rise in first quarter figures, slipped SKr4 to SKr127.
HELSINKI blamed a KOP economist, bearish of the bank sector, for a fall in
the Hex index of 26.0, or more than 2 per cent, to 1,209.2. KOP itself
dropped FM0.50 to FM10.00.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Summers fails to curb yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN continued its power-ful surge against the dollar in yesterday's
European trading, pushing the US currency to an historic low in spite of
attempts by officials in Washington to curb the trend, writes James Blitz.
The Japanese currency has enjoyed a considerable bout of strength in the
interval between the recent announcement of a larger than expected US trade
deficit and today's trade talks between Tokyo and Washington, where US
officials are expected to call for a stronger yen.
At the end of Wednesday's Tokyo trading, the yen had risen to a record high
against the dollar of Y108.64 following a US Treasury report which
underlined that a strong yen could curb the Japanese trade surplus.
As US trading opened, Mr Lawrence Summers, Treasury undersecretary for
international affairs, watered down the impact of the report, saying the US
was not seeking an appreciation of the currency.
But this had little effect. The dollar fell further in London before
finishing at Y108.60; in New York it ended at Y108.45. The D-Mark also
declined to an all-time low against the yen of Y66.51 from a previous
Y67.25.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank in London, believes
the yen will still have a strong upside after today's meeting. 'Dollar/yen
has Y100 written all over it,' he said. He thinks that the announcement of
another rise in the Japanese trade surplus is inevitable in the next month,
underpinning the Japanese currency.
Miss Wendy Niffikeer, an economist at IBJ International in London, also
believes the yen has a strong upside but that it could retrace in the summer
as Japanese economic weakness haunts yen holders.
In Europe, attention focused on the peseta, which suffered a sharp fall
following an allegedly poor performance by Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish
prime minister, in a pre-election television debate. The peseta fell to a
close of Pta77.88 from a previous Pta76.28. In the exchange rate mechanism
grid, its divergence indicator dropped dramatically from plus 55 per cent to
plus 24 per cent.
The fall might have been more dramatic had the D-Mark not been weak.
Yesterday, the currency lost ground against sterling, closing a full pfennig
weaker at DM2.5225. It also ended more than  1/4 pfennig easier against the
dollar at DM1.6320. In New York the US currency closed at DM1.6285.
Once more, the critical issue is that the D-Mark is weakening in spite of
unchanged interest rate policy from the Bundesbank, which left its repo rate
at 7.60 per cent yesterday.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank vice-president, also failed to push the
D-Mark up or German bond yields down with hawkish comments yesterday.
Instead, the German currency dropped to minus 26 per cent against its ERM
divergence indicator, its lowest level since the Yes vote in Denmark.

DEALERS IN German interest rate futures reverted to a fairly bearish outlook
on Bundesbank rate cuts yesterday, as evidence accumulated that Frankfurt
was concerned by the weakness of the D-Mark, writes James Blitz.
The Bundesbank left its repo rate, with which it provides weekly funds to
commercial banks, unchanged yesterday at 7.60 per cent.
That decision had been well anticipated by the market, but a greater source
of bearishness was a speech from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank
vice-president, who echoed the rather hawkish tone on rate cuts made by
colleagues earlier this week.
Mr Tietmeyer said that the gradual easing in German monetary policy had
enjoyed a certain success but that monetary growth was 'still rather high'.
He also underlined that long-term rates were more important than short-term
rates in the formulation of policy. This compounded the bearish mood on a
day when 10-year German bond yields rose from 6.87 per cent to 6.90 per
cent.
All these factors helped to bring the September Euromark contract down 13
basis points to a close of 93.39. The June contract finished 12 basis points
lower at 92.65. With three-month money at 7.43 per cent yesterday, the
latter contract priced in little change over the next few weeks.
French futures barely responded to the move, with dealers biding their time
to see how far the decoupling of French and German rates can go. The
September Pibor contract closed more or less unaltered at 93.32.
Portugal appeared unaffected by the unchanged policy in Germany yesterday,
again reducing its key 'mop-up' rate by 100 basis points to 12 per cent.
There was more bullishness in sterling futures markets as speculation
intensified that the UK might have a new chancellor in the next few weeks.
Two dealers said that they were mystified by a market assumption that a new
chancellor could cut rates soon after taking office. However, the September
contract rose 6 basis points on the day to close at 94.22, a level that
assumes 25 basis points off three-month money by the autumn.
Three-month money ended  1/16 softer at 5 29/32 per cent. A morning shortage
of Pounds 1.15bn was easily despatched.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Argentina (15): Celluloid keepers of conscience -
John Barham finds the film industry enjoying a renaissance - and in crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA's film directors enjoy prestige, influence and an international
reputation to which few of their Latin colleagues can aspire. Directors,
such as Ms Maria Luisa Bemberg, are internationally respected. Mr Luis
Puenzo won an Oscar in 1986 for The Official Story. Mr Fernando Solanas won
a Cannes prize in 1988 as best director.
Directors have become the keepers of Argentina's conscience. Far too many
Argentines would prefer to forget about the people who 'disappeared' during
the 1976-83 military regime, or ignore the poverty and despair that economic
change is bringing.
The industry seems to be going through a renaissance. But the truth is that
Argentine cinema is perhaps facing the greatest crisis in its history. Like
everywhere else in the world, people are making fewer visits to the cinema
and watching videos or cable TV more.
The problem is that this trend has been more prominent in Argentina than in
most other countries. Twenty years ago, Argentina had more than 3,000
cinemas. Today it has about 260. In contrast, there are about 1,400 cable TV
companies, and video clubs proliferate on every street corner. Less than ten
years ago, a successful locally-made film could sell over more than 2m
tickets. Today a successful film sells 400,000 tickets. Few films sell more
than 100,000 tickets.
Mr Fernando Solanas, the angry old man of Argentine cinema, worries that
people who are not able to create their own images are too weak to defend
their own cultural identity. 'We are condemned to consuming images from
abroad, but there is no reciprocity. They do not accept out images.'
Still, Argentines remain great cinephiles. But instead of going to the
cinema they are watching films at home. The trouble is government film
subsidies are tied to the number of cinema tickets a film sells. The fewer
tickets sold, the less government money it gets. And government support is
vital to making films almost everywhere outside Hollywood.
Mr Luis Puenzo, who made TheOfficial Story and Old Gringo, gloomily predicts
that Argentina will not make much more than half a dozen movies this year.
In the postwar years, it turned out a film a week.
Films these days need international support. Mr Luis Cesar d'Angiolillo,
whose Matar el Abuelito was co-produced with Spanish TV, says: 'It's
difficult to make films in Argentina. For us, it's a very expensive
activity, although for the rest of the world our costs are very low.'
As well as money, these co-productions attract big names which help
independent productions compete with Hollywood films. Also,international
backing gives directors a chance to broaden their range. Puenzo made a
Dollars 15m film version of Albert Camus' The Plague in Buenos Aires,
starring William Hurt with 80 per cent of the Dollars 15m budget covered by
French producers. Maria Luisa Bemberg's new film, De Eso no se Habla (We
don't Talk About This), stars Marcello Mastroianni in an Argentine-Italian
co-production.
Argentine films tend to be bleak if not apocalyptic, with an occasional
tendency to becoming ponderous and prolix. Tristan Bauer's Despues de la
Tormenta - a film about despair, decay and poverty is as powerful as it is
depressing.
Luis Puenzo says he chose to set The Plague in contemporary Latin America
because, 'the plague is in the last instance, evil. This relates indirectly
to what happened to us with the military. The plague is an ambiguous,
hidden, ill-defined evil. The central theme of the book and the film is that
the plague always returns. The bacillus never dies.'
Mr Solanas dispensed with subtlety in his latest film El Viaje (The
Journey), a long-winded satire on modern Latin America. It tells the story
of a young man's search for his missing father. On his travels he encounters
Buenos Aires awash with greed and corruption. With the deft use of special
effects, the city is shown flooded with sewage.
Mr Solanas makes harsh criticisms of Mr Menem, who, predictably, is suing
him for slander. Solanas' career gives an idea of the skills Argentine
directors need to survive. In the 25 years since La Hora de los Hornos, his
first feature film, Mr Solanas was exiled for eight years and has made only
five other films. He says: 'A film maker is an organiser who has to do
everything. El Viaje was filmed in five countries and took five years to
make. I may not make another film for two years.'
Still, Argentina's film industry is unlikely to die. Mr Puenzo says 2,500
people are studying film making, plus countless thousands more studying
drama. And successful Argentine directors invariably come home. Mr Puenzo
says he wants his next project to be a low budget film made in Argentina,
spoken in Spanish, with Argentine actors and dealing with Argentine themes.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Argentina (14): Trick is finding something to
offer - George Philip examines recent reforms in the context of Latin
America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE PHILIP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT MENEM has done much to change the way in which we think about
Latin American politics. It used to be so much simpler.
On the left were the populists. They made growth and the redistribution of
income their top priorities. They resorted to unorthodox financial policies
and heavy state intervention. The result was a short-lived boom followed by
rising inflation, popular discontent and - not infrequently- military
intervention.
On the right were the economic liberals. These deflated the economy,
repressed those who resisted, and encouraged private investment. The result
was to restore economic growth, but at a high social price. Because the
price was so high, successful right-wing policies were associated with
authoritarian governments - Pinochet in Chile, or the PRI in Mexico.
Democratically elected governments adopting such policies - Collor in
Brazil, or Perez in Venezuela - risked real disaster. Because they were so
unpopular, policies of liberal capitalism were consistently rejected by
democratic electorates.
At the beginning, Menem was seen as a populist. In some ways he still is. He
is, at any rate, still reasonably popular. For an Argentine president well
into his fourth year in office,that is an achievement in itself. Yet, his
economic policies are, in some respects, clearly liberal. Orthodox finance,
the abandonment of Third World causes, radical privatisation and serious
efforts to collect taxes have not until recently ranked high on the list of
policies calculated to increase the popularity of Latin American presidents.
So what has Menem done, and why has he got away with it?
The trick has been to find something to offer people at most levels of
Argentina society within a policy context acceptable to the most
strategically-important sector, which is the Argentinian business class.
Menem started with an advantage not so readily available to the presidents
of genuinely poor (as opposed to poorly-managed) countries.
A lot of money was in 1989 held abroad by Argentinians, and Argentina still
had a large national private sector. If he could win business confidence,
Menem could bring a large inflow of capital into Argentina without risking
the accusation that he was handing over the country to foreign ownership.
His method of attracting the return of capital was by radical privatisation.
It helped that he had television channels to privatise. The buyers were not
likely to evaluate Menem's policies. Of greater economic importance was the
sheer magnitude of the sell-off. From 1991 to 1994 inclusive, privatisation
receipts are on course to total around Dollars 16bn. This amounts to some
Dollars 4bn. a year. By way of comparison, the total Argentine import bill
in 1990 was just over Dollars 4bn.
The point about privatisation on this scale is that it is not merely a way
for the government to raise money or to improve the performance of some
specific sectors of the economy. There are macroeconomic consequences as
well. Inflows of capital of this amount will raise the exchange rate and
allow an increase in imports. Argentine imports have trebled since 1990.
Economists may regard rising imports with alarm, but from a political point
of view they are very helpful. Middle class Argentinians can afford whisky
and designer clothes. Poorer Argentinians can make a living by marketing
them. Meanwhile a rising real exchange rate has helped the government to
bring the rate of inflation down dramatically while inflicting little real
pain. Since 1990 sharply falling inflation has been associated with steadily
growing GDP and rising standards generally.
Nor are these benefits necessarily for the short term only. The buyers of
privatised assets have had to agree to invest heavily and they are now
beginning to do so. Most state-owned assets have in fact suffered from
neglected over a long period, in addition to being poorly run. The potential
for increases in efficiency and therefore profitability is considerable.
In some cases there are also direct balance of payments advantages. For
example, Argentinian oil production is rising steadily and there are stories
of private sector companies earning huge and easy returns from introducing
secondary recovery techniques for the first time into newly privatised
oilfields. Meanwhile the government is disembarrassed of loss-making stated
companies and it can concentrate its budget on providing benefits and
necessary services for poorer Argentinians.
These reforms are very important, but Menem is only a free market liberal up
to a certain point. There has been no attempt, as was the case with
Pinochet's Chile, to reorganise the whole society around market principles.
Labour laws still make dismissal difficult, and state companies wishing to
reduce their staff - YPF for example - have spent fortunes on compensation
packages. Some foreign buyers of state assets, thinking that they could hire
and fire at will, have at times been rudely surprised. Tight labour laws
have also helped real wages to rise since 1990, since economic restructuring
has not led to serious unemployment.
Neither has Menem ended a particularly Argentinian practice, according to
which the main trade unions actively administer very large social welfare
budgets. Instead proposals exist to allow these unions to participate more
actively in the capital market, in association with the local financial
sector. In Argentina at least, pension funds may be much more secure in the
private sector than in the hands of the state. In 1989 an Argentinian
minister revealed that some Dollars 65bn. of pension funds had disappeared
from state coffers without trace.
Menem therefore retains good contacts within the CGT and within the Peronist
organisation. Unlike Perez in Venezuela he retains the confidence of most of
his own party. He can still get crucial laws through Congress. He is, in
short, still very much a Peronist with a belief in national unity who
retains the confidence of people who voted for him.
There is in Argentina, as in much of Latin America, a considerable popular
attachment to corporatist institutions co-existing with disrespect for the
public sector itself. Menem has dismantled much of the public sector, but
has shown no hostility to corporatist ideas as such. This is an interesting
combination which may be more appropriate in Latin America today than either
pure populism or dogmatic economic liberalism.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Argentina (13): Room for more cost-cutting -
Industrial companies are responding to foreign competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIALISTS say their message is at last getting through to Mr Domingo
Cavallo: market forces alone will not be enough to transform Argentina's
obsolete and uncompetitive industry. Mr Cavallo does seem to have begun
shifting away from a laisser-faire to a more interventionist approach.
The main changes are:
Loans bearing below-market interest from the government's Banco de la Nacion
Argentina (BNA) worth Dollars 4.5bn this year, will be targeted mainly at
exporters, small businesses and farmers.
Companies can import capital goods duty free, at a saving of at least 10 per
cent. Domestic capital goods makers are entitled to a 15 per cent subsidy.
Last October's imposition of a 10 per cent surcharge on all imports (now
waived for capital goods), a move specifically designed to increase
industry's protection from imports.
However, Mr Cavallo is quick to deny that these changes represent a shift
back towards statism. His point is that having achieved macro-economic
stabilisation, the government is now able to turn its attention to
micro-economic issues that it previously had to ignore.
Mr Cavallo's efforts to redirect bank lending to industry and create a
broader capital market are encountering considerable obstacles.
Despite the government's greater interest in industrial policy, businesses
are aware that there will be no return to pretectionism. They see Mr
Cavallo's refocusing as little more than fine tuning.
The corporate scene varies immensely. Industries insulated from external
competition such as cars, or those in the service sector, such as
telecommunications, or those in the booming consumer goods market, are
reaping vast profits.
But exporters or companies facing import competition - especially from
Brazil - must contend with an uncompetitive currency and one of the world's
freest trade policies, despite a hefty rise in import duties last year. The
paper and pulp, steel, textile and petrochemicals industries are suffering
the most, but Mr Cavallo has rejected demands for special breaks for these
industries.
Companies are responding by aggressive cost cutting and productivity drives.
IBM, for instance, has been able to maintain its 6 per cent margin on its
exports of magnetic tape units and printers. All staff are on some form of
performance-related pay. Still, Mr Ricardo Martorana, IBM's president, says
there is still room for yet more cost cutting.
Even a medium-sized company like SICA, a family-owned electrical company, is
biting the bullet. Mr Cesar Wengrower, its vice president, says he has had
to cut his workforce by a 20 per cent and boost sales by 20 per cent to hold
his margin at 7 per cent of sales.
The car industry remains the big exception to the government's free market
principles. The industry is protected by import duties of 20 per cent and
quotas limiting import penetration to 9 per cent of the market.
Manufacturers may, however, import cars and pay a token 2 per cent duty.
Individuals can also import cars, but facea 20 per cent tariff. the effects
of import liberalisation can be seen on the streets of Buenos Aires, where
imported cars, once rarities, are now a common sight.
Trade in cars between Argentina and Brazil is carefully controlled.
Bilateral car trade is set at 40,000 units a year, and trade between the two
countries must be balanced. However, recession in Brazil and boom times in
Argentina led to a 20,000 vehicle shortfall in Argentine exports to Brazil.
Mr Edward Orsini, vice-president of Autolatina, the Volkswagen-Ford joint
venture with factories in Argentina and Brazil, says Argentina's car regime
is no more restrictive than other countries. And, as elsewhere, car industry
policy is a delicate issue because car companies employ many people.
The corollary of protection is regulation: for example, car companies may
now be able to import more, but they must balance their trade, no easy task
when Argentina's productivity still lags leading markets by about 30-50 per
cent.
However, the car industry is making progress in closing the productivity
gap. Autolatina has been able to hold its margins steady for the last two
years, despite sharp increases in labour and other fixed costs.
The industry's output last year hit a record 261,942 units, up from just
99,639 in 1990, the worst year on record. Mr Manuel Antelo, president of
CIADEA, the smallest of Argentina's three carmakers which makes Renault cars
under licence, says 'this bonanza will last for many years'. He says that
Argentina could be building 500,000 units a year within three years.
The recovery brought Autolatina into the black in 1991 for the first time in
a decade. CIADEA expects a Dollars 80m-100m 1993 net profit on sales of
Dollars 1.4bn. Improved trading conditions are drawing companies back to
Argentina.
In May, General Motors announced it would invest Dollars 100m in a pick-up
truck plant in Argentina, 15 years after quitting as the country sank into
political anarchy. CIADEA, GM's local partner plans investments of its own
of about Dollars 150m in 1993-94.
Industrial investments like these are desperately needed to shore up
Argentina's lopsided trade structure: 70 per cent of its exports are primary
goods, but nearly all its imports are industrial products.
Most of the investment seen in the last two years has taken the form of
incorporating new equipment rather than greenfield expansions. Trade data
show that imports of capital goods in 1992 rose to Dollars 3.87bn, twice the
previous year's level and the highest figure in over 20 years.
Just as important, companies need to develop modern management techniques.
One Argentine executive commented: 'Private company management leaves a lot
to be desired. Managers are complacent: they must change their mentality.
The changes that Cavallo is trying to bring require new management skills.'

FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Argentina (11): Envy of the neighbours - John
Barham notes that energy is a fast-growing sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA has impressive energy resources, but until very recently made
little effort to develop them. A virtual state monopoly over the energy
sector prevented Argentina from exploiting resources that are the envy of
its neighbours. Argentina has:
Sufficient oil production to meet domestic needs and produce an exportable
surplus. Reserves are estimated at about 240m cu m, equivalent to about 7-8
years' consumption.
Gas reserves of about 560bn cu m, equivalent to about 30 years' consumption
at current rates.
Hydroelectric power that can be harnessed from ten main river systems and
several Andean valleys ideally shaped for building dams.
The elimination of state monopolies, removal of the crushing burden of
over-regulation and liberalisation of foreign investment laws has made
energy one of Argentina's fastest-growing sectors.
Oil output last year rose 15 per cent to 31.8m cu m. Despite increased
consumption, Argentina still exported Dollars 924m in oil and oil products,
a 21 per cent increase over 1991.
The industry is becoming a magnet for investment and technology. Shell has
raised annual investments to Dollars 100m a year, up from an average Dollars
34m a year in the period 1986-90. Receipts from the privatisation of the
entire gas industry, plus substantial chunks of the oil and electricity
industries already exceed Dollars 6.7bn.
Norcen, a medium-sized Canadian independent oil company, has invested
Dollars 25m in Argentina, bringing with it technology that had not been
applied widely there before, such as three-dimensional seismic prospecting
or horizontal drilling techniques.
The private companies' new technology and better management have led to the
dramatic improvement in production. But there is still much to be done. The
Energy Department says Argentine companies recover only about 20-22 per cent
of reserves, against an international average of about 40 per cent.
The government is benefiting from the oil boom in several ways. First,
through privatisation receipts and second, from rising tax and royalty flows
from private companies. Furthermore, oil exports to Brazil are expected to
rise sharply, offsetting its heavy trade imbalance.
More productive investments will also improve the economy's overall
efficiency. Fiel, an industry-funded economic think tank, estimates that the
state wasted well over Dollars 35bn through inefficient investments, much of
them in energy, in the period 1970-1991. Fiel says the private sector should
be much more productive investors than the public sector.
As part of the privatisation contracts, private operators in the gas, oil
and electricity industries are required to make mandatory investments. The
gas industry alone, for example, must invest Dollars 612m in the period
1993-97. However the government believes companies will invest a further
Dollars 630m of their own accord.
In oil - where mandatory investments are lower - the forecast is for Dollars
7.7bn investments in exploration, production, refining and marketing.
Industrial consumers will also benefit from more reliable supplies and lower
prices. Until recently, large companies often built their own mini power
stations to guarantee electricity supplies for their factories, and sold
excess power to the national grid.
However, Mr Jorge Brea, president of Shell's Argentina subsidiary, warns
against complacency. He says sustaining growth in energy output 'will
require a very important, sustained effort. The bottom line is that you
cannot take it for granted. It requires hard work, investment and yet more
investment.'
Investment is also badly needed in energy-related infrastructure. The
state-owned gas and oil monopolies neglected maintenance of their trunk
pipeline networks, with the result that these systems are operating well
below capacity, so any large increase in gas and oil output will further
strain capacity.
However, the construction of a 15,000 cu m capacity pipeline to Chile which
will come on stream next year will relieve overload on the transport network
in the south of Argentina. The increased oil production will be exported to
Chile, while maintaining supplies to the big energy consumers in Buenos
Aires.
The impending privatisation of state-owned oil giant YPF should further
improveefficiency. Mr Jose Estenssoro, YPF's president, has devoted most of
his energies to restructuring the company to prepare it for privatisation,
but spent less time improving its efficiency. Financial market analysts say
that YPF's productivity and output should improve considerably when it is
transferred to the private sector.
The impact of improved management introduced by private utility operators is
impressive. When the government transferred last year Central Costanera, one
of Buenos Aires' big thermal plants, none of its generators were working but
now all seven are working perfectly. Private utility operators - all of them
foreign - have also cut down on wastage through leaks and energy theft.
This year will also see the privatisation of several hydro dams - including
the big Rio Limay complex in southern Argentina - and the Transener national
grid company.
The Yacyreta dam, built across the Parana river together with Paraguay,
should at last begin producing electricity this year. The 2,700 MW dam was
designed 20 years ago and has cost about Dollars 12bn. Originally budgeted
at Dollars 3.75bn, it has come in six years behind schedule. President
Carlos Menem declared he dam a monument to corruption.
As Yacyreta and the 1,400 MW Piedra del Aguila dam in the Andes both come on
stream, the danger of power blackouts - all too frequent during the past ten
years - should become a thing of the past.
The government is also playing with the idea of privatising the operation of
its two nuclear power stations. The proceeds would be used to complete
Atucha II, the country's third nuclear plant, which has been delayed for
over ten years by budget difficulties.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Argentina (12): Measured on the Big Mac index -
Buenos Aires / One of the world's expensive cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE celebrated Big Mac index, invented by The Economist magazine, suggests
Argentina's exchange rate is heavily overvalued and helps to explain why
Buenos Aires is one of the world's more expensive cities.
A Big Mac hamburger bought at the McDonald's on Calle Florida, Buenos Aires'
busy shopping street costs Dollars 3.60. In New York, the same hamburger
made with the same ingredients to an identical recipe costs Dollars 2.28.
Conclusion: Argentina's peso is 58 per cent overvalued.
Foreigners must contend with prices of goods and services that are
uncomfortably reminiscent of western Europe, but whose quality is
unmistakeably Latin American. Infuriatingly, complaints about high prices
are often met with supercilious replies like: 'The dollar is worth nothing
in Argentina'.
Arguing that the peso is overvalued is heresy. Economy minister, Domingo
Cavallo, says he will never devalue, despite inflation of more than 40 per
cent since congress passed a law fixing the exchange rate at one peso to one
dollar in April 1991.
The official line is that Argentina will always be an expensive country
because it is more developed than its neighbours. Its workers are better
educated and more productive (a claim questioned by some international
companies with operations in Brazil and Chile). The exchange rate,
therefore, is here to stay.
In a way Mr Cavallo is right. Devaluation in Argentina is practically
impossible. This is because the US dollar is Argentina's real currency, not
the peso. Prices may be quoted in pesos, but all the underlying calculations
are still made in dollars, a habit picked up over the years of heavy
inflation. Any nominal devaluation would lead to a spurt of inflation that
would depress the exchange rate, leaving it unchanged in real terms.
In recent weeks a debate over the meaning of the Big Mac index has raged in
Argentina's media. Certainly, the Big Mac index is more revealing than one
would think. McDonalds says that it charges more for its hamburgers because
its inputs - bread, beef, wages, taxes, rent - are more expensive than in
the US. This is improbable. Pedro Lacoste, a Buenos Aires business
consultant, argues that the Big Mac index really shows that MacDonalds is
charging a hefty premium, not that the exchange rate is depressed.
He says McDonalds is a relatively recent arrival in Buenos Aires. Its
restaurants are in prime locations and appeal to upper middle class families
fascinated by the American way of life and prepared to pay prices 58 per
cent higher than in the US.
Juan Llach, economic planning secretary, and one of Mr Cavallo's most
trusted lieutenants, says the only thing the Big Mac index proves is that
consumer prices are distorted by a hugely inefficient retail network. He
also thinks McDonalds has margins of more than 50 per cent. Mr Llach says
that like other retailers - providers of services and non-tradeable goods
who are exposed to little competition - McDonalds has been able to raise its
margins with impunity.
Others would add that they are raising their prices in response to a
consumer boom, the like of which Argentina has not seen on over decade. As a
result, retail prices have risen by more than 40 per cent in two years in
dollar terms, while producer prices have increased by only 9 per cent. And
booming consumer demand is still pushing retail inflation up by about 1 per
cent a month.
Although visitors are horrified by the prices charged in Buenos Aires,
Argentina's exports have not collapsed - as one would expect if the exchange
rate had fallen by half. This is because the price of industrial and export
goods has increased in line with wholesale prices. And ferocious import
competition keeps wholesale prices firmly linked to world inflation.
Last month the government published revised data showing that Argentina's
gross domestic product - the sum of goods and services produced in a year -
rose to Dollars 226.64bn in 1992, a nominal rise of 25 per cent over 1991.
This impressive, not to say surprising achievement, makes Argentina the
wealthiest country in Latin America, a fact frequently quoted by President
Carlos Menem in his speeches.
Here again, the facts are less conclusive. After all, according to the
government's own calculations, GDP was a mere Dollars 68.92bn in 1990, a
year when hyperinflation destroyed Argentina's currency. Clearly,
hyperinflation distorted the data. However, it is just as likely that
today's exchange rate is also distorting GDP figures in the opposite
direction.
In fact, Argentina's GDP may be overstated by about 15 per cent. The
government's figures show that income per head last year was Dollars 6,870.
But according to data published by The Economist newspaper, this was worth
only Dollars 5,930 because Argentina's cost of living is so high. Therefore,
in purchasing power terms, the economy is only about Dollars 190bn, much
less than the government claims.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Argentina (10): Deficit through the decade -
Stephen Fidler checks the country's current account
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA ran a trade deficit last year for the first time since 1981, the
year before the start of Latin America's debt crisis. Even using the
government's own - perhaps optimistic - estimates, the country will be
running a deficit in trade of goods and services until 1998 and will not
again achieve a surplus on the current account of the balance of payments
until 2000.
Forecasts by both government and private sector analysts suggest the current
account deficit should fall slightly this year. If that happens it will be
to the relief of those in the international financial markets worried less
by the absolute size of the deficit than by its rate of growth.
The government's own estimates of the current account deficit are usually
significantly lower than private sector estimates because of differences in
the treatment of earnings on assets held by Argentines outside the country.
Private sector estimates usually put the 1992 deficit between Dollars 8bn
and Dollars 8.7bn - less than 4 per cent of gross domestic product - against
under Dollars 3bn in 1991. The government's own figure suggest a shortfall
of Dollars 6.2bn.
Despite an exchange rate fixed against the dollar since April 1991, exports
have remained steady at just over Dollars 12bn. On the other hand, imports
have surged - encouraged by the strong exchange rate and Argentina's
unilateral lowering of tariffs that have kept the prices of imports down.
After a decade of recession too, there was significant pent-up demand, and
imports more than trebled in three years from Dollars 4.1bn in 1990 to
Dollars 15.1bn in 1992.
A breakdown of the import figures suggests sharp growth not only in consumer
goods, but also in intermediate goods to provide raw materials for booming
sectors of Argentine industry and in capital goods. According to Ministry of
Economy figures, imports of capital goods rose to Dollars 5.6bn last year,
38 per cent of all imports, compared with Dollars 1.3bn and 32 per cent in
1990.
If that is encouraging, there is no hiding the pain being caused by
government policy in some sectors of the economy. Paper, petrochemicals and
textiles and some parts of the steel and farming industry have been hit hard
by the opening of the economy to international competition.
From the Argentine perspective, one of the villains of the piece has been
neighbouring Brazil. Although imports from the US jumped to Dollars 3bn last
year from Dollars 1.1bn in 1990, Argentines are more concerned about the
flood of Brazilian goods into the country. Imports from Brazil last year
totalled about Dollars 3.3bn compared with Dollars 718m in 1990.
The problem is seen in part as a consequence of Brazil's recession. In a bid
to keep up production levels, Brazilian industry is pushing aggressively
priced goods into Argentina.
But it is also a consequence of the two governments pursuing diametrically
opposed exchange rate policies. While Brazil is keeping its exchange rate
highly competitive to keep exports up, Argentina's fixing of its nominal
exchange rate to the dollar makes for a high real exchange rate.
In an attempt to slow the growth in imports Argentina raised last October
its so-called statistics tax on imports from 3 to 10 per cent. The move took
place in the absence of a developed system of anti-dumping regulations but
was viewed as protectionist and probably against the rules of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The tax was subsequently lifted on about 60 products imported from Paraguay,
Argentina's partner along with Brazil and Uruguay in the proposed Mercosur
common market. And on May 1 it was removed from imports of capital goods.
(Capital goods manufacturers were also given a 15 per cent rebate on their
sales.)
The problem of import surges may be ameliorated if Brazil, as most forecasts
suggest, resumes growth this year. Nonetheless, Brazilian economic
instability seems set to remain of concern to the Argentine government.
Argentine officials privately do not see much economic progress in Brazil
until after a new administration takes office in January 1995. At the start
of that month Mercosur's internal tariffs will have fallen to zero and a
common external tariff is scheduled to be in place.
Mr Guido di Tella, Argentina's foreign minister, says it is now clear that
the common external tariff will not apply to all goods, but instead to
between 70 and 80 per cent of imports. This is because Brazil has shown
itself unwilling to lower its higher tariffs on computers and capital
equipment imports to the likely common tariff level of a maximum 20 per
cent.
'There is a problem but not a tragic one. It is anyway to our advantage:
they will be less competitive because their industry will have to buy more
expensive computers and capital equipment,' says Mr di Tella.
It is early days to talk of expanding Mercosur although Bolivia - itself a
member of the Andean Pact trade grouping - has expressed an interest. Chile
is thought to be awaiting, first, some stability in the Brazilian economy
and, second, the certainty that the next government in Argentina remains
faithful to the cause of regional integration.
The other big trade integration issue for Argentina is the North American
Free Trade Agreement, awaiting ratification this year by the legislatures of
Mexico, Canada and the US. Clinton administration officials have spoken of
extending the pact to Chile, Venezuela and Argentina. Yet Argentina is
committed to talk to the US with its Mercosur partners; and Brazil is likely
to remain a restraining influence on the extension of Mercosur for some time
to come. The question may therefore arise of where Argentina sees its
priorities. That, however, is a question for the future, if it is a question
at all.
'The US proposal to incorporate Chile, Venezuela and Argentina into a free
trade zone is one thing and Mercosur another,' said President Carlos Menem.
'Nonetheless, to the extent that we advance in the process of integration,
it is possible that in the not too distant future it will be possible to
incorporate all four countries of Mercosur into a free trade zone.'

FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Argentina (9): Shake-out on the pampas - Farmers
are already financially stretched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S PAMPAS qualify as one of the world's richest farmlands, where
farmers using no artificial fertilisers or agrochemicals still have yields
comparable to, or better than, producers in other main farming nations.
Yet, for all their natural advantages, Argentina's farmers are being
squeezed by rising costs, falling commodity prices and a new domestic
economic scene that is forcing everybody - farmers, bankers, business people
 -to adjust sharply.
The problem is that most farmers are already financially overstretched or
are unable to find sufficient financing at the right terms to modernise
their operations. By one widely accepted estimate, about 150,000-200,000
mainly small and medium-sized farms are under great financial pressure and a
large number of them are facing bankruptcy.
However, the threat of shakeout on the pampas is more a social than an
economic problem. Nobody expects Argentina's grain and oilseed exports to
suffer. On the contrary, they are likely to benefit from the market's
unrelenting pressure to boost productivity.
Mr Hugo Krajnc, a manager at Cargill's Buenos Aires office, adds that
modernisation means not just adopting better farming techniques or buying
new tractors, but applying modern financial and management methods. Few
farmers use commodity markets to hedge their prices, and too many plan their
crops based on last year's market conditions, rather than looking ahead to
probable future market conditions, Mr Krajnc says.
Nobody likes the disruption and pain that shakeouts bring. Farmers have
reacted with protests, although none of them on the scale of French farmers'
demonstrations. However, countless one day strikes in which farmers suspend
deliveries to market, close roads and hold town meetings have done little to
soften the government's heart.
Until recently, that is. In May, the government announced that farmers will
be able to import tractors, trucks and agricultural machinery duty-free. It
has also instructed the state-owned Banco de la Nacion Argentina (BNA) to
lend farmers and small businesses USDollars 4.5bn this year at below market
interest rates.
Farmers still complain that BNA's terms are inadequate. Although BNA's rates
are lower than those of other banks, they are still a stiff 16-24 per cent a
year in real terms.
Argentina's farmers own about 200,000 tractors, but only 80,000 of them are
less than 15 years old. Replacing the most obsolete tractors would cost
about Dollars 3.7bn. yet holding on toobsolete machinery is also very
expensive. More than Dollars 500m a year - a sum roughly equivalent to
Argentina's annual wheat exports - are reckoned to be lost every year due to
waste caused by old machinery.
But no amount of special pleading by farmers or government intervention can
change distortions in the world grain market caused by the US-EC subsidies
war. According to the Argentine Rural Society (SRA), which groups together
the country's big farmers, international prices for Argentina's main export
crops - wheat, maize and soyabeans - are about 30-40 per cent below levels
of the mid-1980s, when the subsidies war first broke out.
There is little prospect of any in improvement prices in the near future.
In fact, prices this year have continued falling for most crops. Wheat
prices are now 10 per cent lower than a year ago; corn prices are 5 per cent
lower; soyabeans have recovered very slightly.
Reductions in local costs have done little to compensate for the
international price collapse. The government has lowered taxes and utility
charges and scrapped duties on imported farm machinery, but a tractor still
costs the equivalent of 256 tonnes of wheat, slightly more than a year ago.
The same applies for other key inputs such as fuel and fertiliser. Financial
charges, and other inputs, such as labour, electricity and taxes remain a
heavy burden.
The picture is not uniformly bleak. Although the SRA says wheat farmers are
struggling with negative net margins of 2 per cent, soyabean farmers now
have a 22 per cent positive net margin. Although experts say that farmers
are cutting costs, there is still room for further cuts.
It is hardly surprising, then, that wheat output last year fell 11 per cent
to 9.9m tonnes and is expected to fall another 6 per cent this year.
Soyabean production rose 14 per cent to 11.3m tonnes in 1992, but is
expected to fall slightly this year.
Signs are already emerging that these pressures are leading to consolidation
of land holdings, especially in the key farming region of Buenos Aires.
Many farms on the pampas are absurdly small by Argentine standards, often
measuring no more than a few hundred hectares. Coninagro, a farm
co-operative body, reckons that as many as 85 per cent of the farms in
Buenos Aires province, which covers most of the pampas, are too small to pay
their way. It says a wheat-producing farm must cover at least 625 hectares.
Most of the attention is focused on the plight of the pampas' farmers, but
farmers in distant provinces face evenmore dramatic conditions. Sheep
farmers in Patagonia, sugarcane and tobacco growers in the northwest and
cotton producers in the north all face far greater problems. However, their
impact on the economy and political clout are relatively small.
The focus is beginning to shift to the highly inefficient retail and
distribution network. The press has discovered for instance, that middlemen
boost retail prices by three to four times producer prices.
The effects of the government's privatisation programme is also being felt.
Privatised railways are lowering transport costs butprivatised energy
utilities no longer sell underpriced gas and electricity.
Farmers must become far more efficient in producing traditional bulk
commodity crops. Few analysts see much future in high margin produce such as
exotic fruit and vegetables. Chile's success in developing markets for these
goods in North American, Japan and Western Europe is often held up as an
example for Argentina.
Although Argentina could undoubtedly improve the quality and presentation of
its existing fruit and vegetables they are hardly likely to replace its
staple grain exports. After all, the Pampas are almost designer-made grain
and cattle-grazing land.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Argentina (7): An ability to flout the rules -
Political priorities have not interfered with economic orthodoxy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS IS a political year in Argentina. Mid-term congressional elections are
due in October. Constitutional reform and President Carlos Menem's
re-election bid overshadow the political scene.
But for the first time in many years, political uncertainties have not led
to economic uncertainty. It is to Mr Menem's credit that he has not allowed
his political priorities to sweep him too far from the path of economic
orthodoxy.
He has agreed to potentially unpopular and vote-losing measures, such as
spending cuts or closing down loss-making rail services. Mr Rosendo Fraga, a
political commentator, explains that 'Menem's most important electoral and
political asset is the economy'.
Opinion polls show steady support for government economic policy, with a 41
per cent approval rating. And the rating of Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy
minister, is 50 per cent - significantly higher than Mr Menem's 38 per cent.
The message is that voters will vote for economic stability.
The free market consensus that emerged from the chaos of hyperinflation in
1990 shows no signs of weakening. And it is the government alone that stands
to benefit politically from this. Even Mr Naldo Brunelli, general secretary
of the CGT labour confederation that is fighting a rearguard action against
liberalisation, says: 'We think the changes are irreversible.'
Paradoxically, there are signs that the government's formerly unassailable
political strength is waning. Mr Menem's control over the Peronist party and
Congress is weakening. He can no longer count on a submissive rubber stamp
to keep laws unchanged. Congress has substantially altered laws privatising
the oil company YPF and introducing a private pension system.
The Peronists, Congress and even the government are even more deeply split
over the controversial question of labour reform. Reforming the labour
market is potentially explosive because it attacks the very origins of
Peronism.
The emergence of challengers for nomination as the Peronist party's
presidential candidate in the 1995 elections has further undermined Mr
Menem's authority. This has made the presidential succession an unavoidable
issue, even though Mr Menem's term does not end until 1995.
The challenges are all the more damaging, because Mr Menem still appears as
committed as ever to changing the constitution to allow him to stand for
re-election. Asked if he wished to continue in power, Mr Menem said: 'It is
hard to answer this. General Roca, (elected president in 1880) when asked
what he wanted to be after being president, said 'to be president again.'
And that is what my answer is.'
Senator Jose Octavio Bordon, a former governor of Mendoza province in the
west, is the first Peronist to openly toss his hat into the ring. Sen Bordon
promises 'a more profound transformation of the state: more efficient public
spending, more decentralisation, more public participation, a more efficient
judiciary'.
Mr Eduardo Duhalde, Mr Menem's former vice president until he was elected
governor of Buenos Aires province in 1991, is another strong - but still
undeclared - Peronist candidate. Other candidates include two of Mr Menem's
proteges - Mr Ramon Ortega, a former pop singer, and Mr Carlos Reutemann, a
former Formula 1 champion. These two politicians were elected provincial
governors in 1991 with Mr Menem's backing.
The opposition Radical party's front runner is Senator Fernando de la Rua.
His rival is Mr Eduardo Angeloz, the Radical governor of Cordoba province
and Mr Menem's challenger in the 1989 presidential election. Both men stress
that they too will maintain Mr Menem's economic policies.
Like Senator Bordon, the Radical candidates say they will rebuild
Argentina's institutions like the judiciary and Congress, and place a
greater emphasis on social and educational policy. They are responding to a
shift in voters' priorities.
Mr Luis Moreno Ocampo, an influential former federal prosecutor, points out
that Mr Menem's great virtue as an unorthodox politician is his ability to
flout rules. This enabled him to break up the corporate state.
But this ability is also his great shortcoming: he has not reconstructed the
state's ability to administer justice, provide decent education and health
services or establish an efficient and honest civil service.
However, Mr Menem has made some progress. He has introduced oral trials,
abolishing traditional written trials which were both slow and vulnerable to
corruption. He has also proposed long overdue reforms to the shadowy funding
of political campaigns and has even suggested regular, perhaps annual,
referenda on principal issues.
Corruption remains a top political issue. Although deregulation and
privatisation have removed much of the scope for bribery, businessmen and
ordinary people still complain about corruption. The government has been
rocked by 20 serious cases of corruption since taking office in July 1989,
yet not one has been satisfactorily investigated.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Argentina (8): Diplomatic talks go on - The
Falkland Islands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA is obsessed with the Falkland Islands. Eleven years after its
defeat in the 74-day conflict with Britain, the country's overriding foreign
policy aim is winning sovereignty over the islands.
In every important speech, President Carlos Menem makes a ritual reference
to Argentina's sovereignty over the Falklands. He claims his policy of
rapprochement - rather than confrontation - with Britain will enable
Argentina to 'recover' sovereignty over the islands by 2000.
Mr Menem said: 'We will continue talking. In the world of diplomacy one
needs great patience. There is no possibility of taking this conflict over
the Falklands to a situation similar to 1982.'
His aim is to draw the UK into as close a relationship as possible. Stronger
trade and investment links with Argentina would gradually reduce the
importance of the Falklands to Britain. Eventually, London will have
sufficient confidence in Argentina to consider transferring sovereignty.
Several British companies already operate privatised utilities in Argentina.
But instead of receding, the Falklands question remains an open sore in
bilateral relations.
Argentina continually presses for greater involvement in developing the
natural resources. In 1991 the UK agreed to co-operate to conserve
fisheries. Last year Argentina began to issue fishing licences, muscling in
on the main source of revenue.
Ordinary Argentines are frustrated that Mr Menem's policy has still not led
to any talks over the crucial issue of sovereignty. London has remained
unyielding in its insistence that co-operation with Argentina does not imply
any recognition of its claim to the islands. The UK foreign office says this
policy will change only if and when the islands' fewer than 2,000
inhabitants agree to a change in their status.
Last month, Argentina suffered another diplomatic slap in the face when
Britain announced it would extend territorial waters to 200 miles around the
remote and uninhabited South Georgia and South Sandwich island groups, which
Argentina also claims.
Oil is emerging as another source of friction. The Falklands are believed to
have big oil and gas deposits and Argentina wants to tie Britain into a
joint oil regime. London has ignored Argentina's arguments, and last year
licensed two companies to carry out seismic exploration in two blocks around
the islands. Britain refuses to discuss oil co-operation until studies
confirm the region does have hydrocarbon reserves in commercial quantities.
There is scant chance of a shift in the islanders' virulently anti-Argentine
attitudes. Memories of Argentina's three-month military occupation remain
fresh.
And Britain has still not lifted its arms embargo on Argentina. London has
also successfully persuaded Washington not to sell two squadrons of ageing
Skyhawk fighter bombers to Argentina. However, talks are planned later this
year to resume training courses for Argentine officers at British military
academies.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Argentina (6): Uncertainty over pensions -
Financial market reform is one of the government's frustrations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL market reform must rank among the government's great frustrations.
Despite Argentina's dramatic economic recovery, officials complain that few
private banks have made sufficient progress in modernisation.
And to the government's undisguised concern, bankers have responded to
deregulation by financing a consumer boom. The equity market has failed to
recover from a speculative binge last year.
The principal uncertainty hanging over financial markets is the shape of the
future pension system, which the government hopes will become a cornerstone
of a modern capital market. But pension reform has run into heavy opposition
in Congress.
Politicians have already rejected the plan of economy minister Domingo
Cavallo to force all employees to pay 11 per cent of their income into
individual retirement savings accounts, which would be administered by fund
managers.
Instead, Congress has made contribution to private pension schemes
voluntary. It has also ordered the government-owned Banco de la Nacion
Argentina (BNA) to provide contributors to its pension funds with a minimum
dollar-based guaranteed return.
Mr Cavallo maintains that these are only superficial changes, which do not
affect the heart of pension reform. He is confident that most people will
prefer private pension funds, which he believes will offer higher returns
and will be seen as less risky than the BNA's government-guaranteed fund.
Bankers nevertheless worry that BNA's guaranteed return could not only
hamper private sector competition but would also fail to lighten the burden
of the government's existing pension liabilities. They also wonder how the
government can guarantee millions of BNA clients guaranteed dollar incomes,
irrespective of the risk of a devaluation.
Question marks must also remain over the wider issue of how much and how
quickly the pension system can boost Argentina's savings rate and reduce its
reliance on imported capital. Mr Roque Fernandez, central bank president,
commented that pension funds 'will not bring a phenomenal change. I hope it
comes, but I think it will be gradual.'
Meanwhile, the equity market, which will one of the principal beneficiaries
of a reformed pension system, is in the doldrums. Share prices have been
unable to recover from a disastrous price slide that began last June. The
Merval market index now stands at less than half its May 1992 high of 882.
The decline has continued this year, spurred by a huge overhang of
overpriced shares still held by investors. Share prices dipped sharply in
April and May in anticipation of July's planned privatisation of Argentina's
largest company, the national oil corporation YPF. Uncertainty over
President Menem's re-election bid has also dampened enthusiasm. However,
Argentine stocks are still not cheap, with price/earnings ratios averaging
about 18.
Market capitalisation of USDollars 18bn is equivalent to only 8 per cent of
GDP, a low ratio even by regional standards. Daily turnover rarely exceeds
Dollars 30m, and the market continues to be gripped by a strong speculative
mentality.
Investors are deterred by a narrow market in which liquidity is a problem in
all but a few actively traded stocks. Three companies - two privatised
telephone stocks and the Perez Companc holding company - account for half of
market capitalisation.
Instead of listing, companies are actually departing the market, with only
164 companies now quoted against 171 last year. Thirty years ago, the Buenos
Aires market had more than 600 quoted companies. The government's Comision
Nacional de Valores checked capital markets regulator has approved more than
30 companies to list, but only a few have come to the market.
Low international interest rates make bond issues more attractive for
companies. Salomon Brothers says that last year more than 20 Argentine
companies issued Dollars 1.97bn in bonds, notes and commercial paper.
Possibly the government's greatest frustration is its inability to force
banks to lower interest rates and improve terms for industrial borrowers,
particularly for smaller companies unable to approach the local and
international capital markets.
Argentina's banking system has changed beyond recognition from the chaos and
speculative frenzy of the 1980s. In June 1989, as hyperinflation raged,
central bank liquid reserves were a mere Dollars 112m. In April, the second
anniversary of Argentina's celebrated convertibility law, the central bank's
liquid reserves exceeded Dollars 10bn.
As a result of the confidence brought by convertibility, bank deposits have
risen dramatically and maturities have been stretched out. Last month,
deposits - less than half of them in dollars - stood at Dollars 29.3bn,
against Dollars 18bn a year earlier. As a result, lending rose to Dollars
41.38bn, against Dollars 24.4bn in April 1992.
Banks are immensely profitable. Spreads at about 2-3 percentage points
remain high - although they have fallen sharply - and private banks have cut
costs aggressively and boosted lending and fee-based income.
For instance, Banco Frances, a locally owned commercial bank and one of
Argentina's top five banks, saw its net assets grow 137 per cent to Dollars
1.08bn last year, against Dollars 378m prior to currency convertibility. Net
income in the year to June 1993 is forecast at Dollars 47.6m, 37 per cent
more than last year.
Banks are less interested in lending to companies, especially risky small
and medium-sized ones. Instead, most of the profit growth is coming from
lending to consumers.
Mr Nicholas Grose Hodge, chief manager of Lloyds Bank in Argentina, says
'This continues to be a pretty good year for banks, with one notable
exception - that bad debts and credit risk are getting much worse.' Under an
admittedly broad central bank definition, problem loans stand at 4 to 6 per
cent of the private banking system's total loans.
The government is trying use the weight of BNA, which is also the country's
biggest financial institution, to drive interest rates down. Interest rates
vary from a real negative monthly rate of 0.5 per cent on blue chip
corporate loans to a stinging real 5 to 6 per cent per month for riskier
borrowers.
It has announced that BNA will lend Dollars 4.5bn at below market interest
rates to small companies and farmers. But bankers say BNA's efforts are
unlikely to have the desired effect, simply because they have little
intention of competing in the small company and farm lending sectors.
Neither are central bank capital adequacy regulations making much
difference. Central bank regulations require banks charging higher interest
rates to set aside more capital. The government believed this would force
banks to lower rates. But banks, whose gearing, at about 8 times capital, is
low by international standards, have been happy to use their capital as
profitably as possible.
Bankers say that the real culprits are inefficient regional banks, most of
them owned by provincial governments, which distort interest rates
throughout the system. Their funding costs are high, a reflection of the
poor quality of their portfolios. Their operating costs are also higher,
because few government-owned banks have cut costs sufficiently. The
government rejects these claims, stating that banks - private and government
banks alike - remain highly inefficient.
Living with stability is becoming increasingly difficult for smaller and
medium sized banks, a majority of which flourished in the bad old days of
heavy inflation and high interest rates. Argentina still has more than 160
banks of varying shapes and sizes. Many will probably merge, seek out niches
in the investment bank market or simply close down.
Some foreign banks with small branch networks have already decided to wind
up retail operations. Chase Manhattan has sold its 15-branch network and its
credit card business.
Marcelo Podesta, Chase's Buenos Aires managing director, says: 'We did not
want to invest in systems to get up to the scale the (retail) market
required. It is not a priority investment for the bank.' Instead, Chase is
concentrating on sophisticated financial products and project finance for
large clients. The trouble is that with so many banks thinking the same way,
competition in the wholesale market is fierce.
Many retail and wholesale banks have taken an increasingly active role in
privatisations. Some, such as Banco Rio de la Plata - the country's biggest
bank - have taken direct stakes in privatised companies. Others have backed
investors in privatisations, underwritten privatisation share flotations, or
structured financing for privatised companies' investments.
Mr Fernandez wants banks to adopt greater securitisation of both their
assets and liabilities, which would reduce institutions' vulnerability to
mismatching or sudden shifts in market conditions. Foreign bankers also
expect the market to make increasing use of sophisticated derivative
products, such as bond- and equity-linked swaps and options.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Argentina (4): Ownership switches - Privatisation
signals radical shift in the economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PRIVATISATION has been the linchpin of the Argentine government's economic
programme. It has allowed the government to put its budget to rights,
brought sorely-needed investment to badly run-down utilities and provided a
strong psychological signal of drastic change in Argentina's economic
regime.
The numbers are impressive. According to figures cited by Mr Juan Carlos
Sanchez Arnau, privatisation secretary in the economy ministry, the
companies so far privatised by the government were receiving average annual
transfers from the government of Dollars 2.1bn between 1980 and 1989. Now,
not only have these transfers ceased, but the privatised companies pay tax,
which ran into hundreds of millions of dollars last year.
The privatisations so far have raised Dollars 5.4bn in cash and Dollars
12.5bn face value of government debt has been cancelled through debt equity
swaps. A further Dollars 1.5bn of liabilities were transferred from the
government to the private sector. On top of that, there is a gathering
movement towards privatisations by some provincial governments.
The government, he says, has also been pleasantly surprised by the
investment in privatised industry. 'We are monitoring the companies and all
started to make investments very quickly. This is one of the most important
aspects of the results.'
The two privatised telephone companies invested Dollars 400m in 1991,
Dollars 1.2bn in 1992 and - judging from the rate of investment in the first
quarter - are expected to make Dollars 1.5bn in investments this year.
Companies owning privatised roads invested Dollars 188m in 1991 and Dollars
120m last year. The new owners of the railways will be expected to invest
Dollars 200m-250m a year; the gas companies at least Dollars 200m a year.
Even the much criticised sale of Aerolineas has brought Dollars 188m in new
investment, says Mr Sanchez Arnau.
For some companies, the transfer to the private sector was just in time.
Indeed, the transfer of the Costanera power station in Buenos Aires in March
1992 to Chilean investors led by Endesa was on the day the last functioning
generator stopped. Now all seven of the station's generators are working.
While Endesa might not agree, some privatised companies are popularly
reckoned to be making a mint. But Mr Juan Masjoan, president of Telecom
Argentina - a company jointly operated by France Telecom and Stet of Italy
which made profits of Dollars 150.3m after tax in its last financial year
compared with Dollars 55.2m a year earlier - argues the task the new owners
have undertaken is far from easy.
'Everything has to be changed by 180 degrees,' he says. 'From an
organisational point of view, we took over a government office. It was
highly unproductive - productivity was running at one-third of international
levels.'
There was little or no decentralisation or delegation of authority, minimal
training of staff and where computers were being used they were being used
badly.
Technologically, the picture was as just as bad: only 10 per cent of the
company's infrastructure could be described as 'modern', defined as anything
less than 10 years old. Yet upgrading the technology may be the easy part.
One third of the network was new technology by the end of September 1992. Mr
Masjoan estimates that by the same time this year, more than 50 per cent of
the network will be modern.
'The most difficult thing to change in the company are the people. You need
to develop a customer-oriented service and decentralise without losing
control.'
Telecom's 16,700 employees (down from 21,205 at the time of privatisation)
now work in 19 operating units. One department is weeding out corruption in
a country where a bribe until recently was necessary to secure a phone line
or to get one repaired.
Another foreign operator, British Gas, took over the gas distribution system
in Buenos Aires and brought over some 35 managers to help get it into shape.
It has already reduced the number of employees from 2,000 to 1,300. Senior
managers say that in some respects they have been pleasantly surprised. Some
aspects of the network were in better shape than they had expected.
The experience of the users of privatised industries has been varied.
Travellers have complained of a deterioration of service on the state
airline, for example. Mr Sanchez Arnau says this is now improving. New
customers of Telecom must now wait an average nine months (six in Buenos
Aires) for a new line, compared with three years before. Repairs are being
carried out more quickly and, as mechanical exchanges are phased out, the
system's capacity is being expanded.
However, telephone calls are still expensive, particularly long distance and
international calls. Long distance makes up 7-8 per cent of Telecom's
traffic but accounts for 70 per cent of revenues.
These high rates are encouraging unofficial competition for international
calls such as cheap call-back services from the US that are eating into the
temporary monopolies granted the new owners when they took over the
companies.
The interests of consumers are supposed to be looked after by independent
regulatory agencies. Since utilities were previously state owned, there is
no experience of such regulatory bodies and there is a widespread view that
telephone regulation is not working as it should.
The effectiveness of the more recently created water, electricity and gas
regulatory bodies is yet to be tested.
Mr Cavallo rescued the privatisation programme from disrepute when he took
over the economy ministry in early 1991, halting and refashioning it to
increase its transparency. This has quietened some of the opposition to the
programme, although on occasions some losing bidders have privately
intimated dissatisfaction with the bidding process. But the bidding is only
part of the story.
The importance of effective regulation has become paramount: a perception
that newly-privatised utilities are using their monoply positions to exploit
the public could damage the government and its economic programme severely.
Another issue has been the lack of sizeable Argentine partners for the
foreign operators in privatisations. A predictable handful of Argentine
companies appear in just about every privatisation - Perez Companc, Techint
and Comercial del Rio de la Plata - because only they have had the size to
get sufficient finance.
'There are potential problems emerging in these huge concentrations of
wealth and economic power in the hands of a few companies,' says a banker
from the British merchant bank, Midland Montagu. That, and the development
of effective anti-trust legislation, seem likely to be issues for a future
government, however.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Argentina (2): Breakneck pace / Review of the
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA is the latest blue-eyed boy of the Washington international
financial institutions. Economic reform has been at breakneck pace and is
delivering growth - nearly 9 per cent annually over the last two years. The
government's fiscal house has been put in order: tax revenues have increased
threefold since 1989 and the government is running a surplus helped in part
by Latin America's most radical privatisation programme.
This has happened not under a government where opposition is repressed or
muted by the political system, as in Chile during the 1980s and in Mexico,
but in a relatively democratic context. Indeed, some people inside and
outside the country are beginning to talk of an Argentine economic miracle.
On the face of it, the figures on the accompanying chart suggest Argentina
is doing well even when compared with the region's other commonly-cited
economic 'success stories'.
The main threat to the miracle, many people believe, is the lack of
sustainability of the policy that has fixed the exchange rate to the dollar
since April 1991. Argentine inflation is coming down rapidly - consumer
prices rose 17.5 per cent in the year to December and 11.7 per cent in the
year to April - but prices are still rising at a rate which puts Argentine
industry under severe competitive pressure.
Evidence is said to be visible in a current account deficit which widened
rapidly last year to just under 4 per cent of gross domestic product,
increasing the economy's dependency on capital inflows from abroad.
Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister who tied the peso to the dollar
(and secured a law which prevented the central bank from printing money
except when backed by foreign currency inflows), says devaluing the peso
would be 'madness'. The competitive advantages of doing so would evaporate
as inflationary expectations, which are highly sensitive to the exchange
rate in Argentina, rose.
He argues that if foreign owners of capital are worried about Argentina's
exchange rate, they are not showing it. Capital continued to flow into the
country during the first four months of 1993.
Furthermore, the effect of the exchange rate on the competitive position of
Argentine industry is being exaggerated. Lower tariffs on imports have
helped to contain the cost of industry inputs - wholesale prices rose only
3.2 per cent last year.
Mr Cavallo's mind is on other things besides the exchange rate. At the start
of the month his ministry issued its plans for further reform and economic
projections until the end of the current administration's term of office in
1995.
They project 43 per cent growth in GDP for the six years of the Menem term,
by the end of which inflation - as measured by the mean of consumer and
wholesale prices - will have fallen to less than 4 per cent and 1.6m new
jobs will have been created. The economy, Mr Cavallo says, has grown by 18
per cent in the past two years and 670,000 jobs have been created. Inflation
when Mr Menem took office was 200 per cent a month.
His objectives for the future will lay 'a strong emphasis on savings,
investment and jobs', he said in an interview:
Savings: Huge tax evasion used to mean the incentives for savings were
ineffective. The government's fight against evasion of its value added tax
has proved successful and 600,000 companies have been brought into the net.
Now, the government plans to turn its attention to fighting evasion of
income taxes, attempting to bring 2m people, including professionals and
self-employed, into the income tax net and to ensure they pay social
security. This would help raise the domestic savings rate to 20 per cent by
1995 from about 17 per cent now, reducing reliance on foreign savings.
According to the government's projections, the dependence on external
capital peaked last year and will decline steadily until 2000 when it will
fall to zero.
Investment: The government has already provided help for buyers of capital
goods, exempting them from a 10 per cent import tax on imports and provides
domestic producers of capital goods with tax rebates on what they sell.
Employment: There are plans to cut labour taxes. These cuts would deepen
with increasing distance from Buenos Aires, to encourage companies to move
into areas which have so far seen little economic growth. Incentives would
be given to provincial governments to follow central government in
simplifying its tax structure. The government is also encouraging the
state-owned Banco de la Nacion to provide cheaper credit for small
businesses, farmers and fishermen to encourage restructuring in these areas.
Mr Cavallo denies that what is taking shape is an industrial policy. He has
no bureaucrat in his office working on these issues. 'We still have no
industrial policy that helps specific sectors. It's not that we think it's
good or bad. It's because the government doesn't have the ability to do
this.'
The aim is to lay down a programme for the remaining two years of the
government and invite the opposition to come up with its own. The minister
says he wants to increase transparency of economic policy and reduce
uncertainty about a political transition.
In a recent magazine interview, Mr Cavallo not only underlined that the
convertibility plan would be maintained without either him or Mr Menem. He
further said that leading economists of the opposition Radical Party  - such
as Mr Adolfo Sturzenegger and Mr Ricardo Lopez Murphy - would be capable of
running the economy very well.
There are those who believe Mr Cavallo is taking some risks this year, by
pursuing a policy which will avoid recession but heighten the risk of
inflation. Mr Miguel Broda, who runs aneconomic analysis company, says Mr
Cavallo has taken a number of measures over the last half year apparently
intended to avoid a slowing of growth and raise both demand and supply.
Since September 1992 the government has increased social security payments,
given value added tax rebates to exporters and reduced taxes on diesel,
announced increased government expenditures, cut bank reserve requirements
and given tax incentives to producers and buyers of capital goods.
Furthermore, it has promised to use the proceeds from the sale of the state
oil company to clear the government's debts to pensioners. This latter move
will have a strong impact on consumption, Mr Broda predicts.
This could mean that growth, instead of slowing down to 2-3 per cent this
year, will stay above 5 per cent, making realistic the government projection
of 6.5 per cent. The gamble is on inflation: many Argentine companies are
already running at full capacity. Industrial production has increased 34 per
cent since the convertibility plan was introduced and is already running,
says Mr Broda, at the highest level in Argentine history.
Mr Broda suggests that Mr Cavallo is seeking strong economic growth this
year in order to boost tax revenues. This will allow him to reduce taxes on
labour.
He says Mr Cavallo is doing this because 1992 was a lost year for the
government in terms of advancing labour and social security reforms, both of
which are meant to improve flexibility of the labour market and lower the
non-wage costs of hiring labour. Mr Cavallo says both reforms will be in
place by the end of the year.
The social security and pensions reform is with the senate, having passed
the house of deputies with some modifications. These allow, for example, for
people to stay within a state system if they want. The fact that private
pensions will not be compulsory has worried some of the reform's supporters
who see it diluting the reforms's beneficial impact. Mr Cavallo says he is
satisfied: 'We wanted a perfect law. Now it's not 100 per cent but it's a
very good law even with the modifications.'
Meanwhile, although the labour law might not be introduced to Congress
before the October congressional elections, it would be in place by next
year. While there is evidence that some Argentine industry is responding to
low inflation and a strong exchange rate by restructuring, the question is
whether it will be enough; rises in wages have been eroding some of the
productivity gains. At his economic analysis company, Mr Broda wonders aloud
whether Mr Cavallo is betting too high: he now says there is a 50 per cent
chance that the current parity between the dollar and the peso will still be
in place by the end of 1994. But if Mr Cavallo wins his bet, the gains could
be dramatic.
The government is projecting 54 per cent growth between now and the end of
the century. It is too early yet to talk of an Argentine economic miracle,
though one cannot be ruled out.
At worst, it may settle into moderate inflation and moderate growth: no
miracle, perhaps, but a huge improvement on the 1980s.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Argentina (5): State oil goes private / Profile of
Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVENTY-ONE years after it became the first government oil company in the
world, Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales is set to become the first state
oil company in Latin America to be privatised.
Through an enormous offering of shares nationally and internationally,
scheduled for early July, YPF will pass into private hands. The sale of the
state oil company will cap the Argentine privatisation programme, rendering
it almost complete except for the sales of minority stakes in some of the
country's already-privatised companies.
The sale will underline the extent of the transformation in the economic
role of the state since the Menem administration took office in July 1989.
YPF has already been radically restructured. Its workforce of 52,000 in 1990
has been reduced to fewer than 12,000, non-core assets are being sold off as
are oil and gas wells in order to dilute its monopoly position.
Yet, the sale of Argentina's largest company raises many political and other
questions. As in all privatisations, the government risks accusations that
it is selling off the family silver at too low a price. Yet if the
government tries to sell at too high a price, there are risks that the sale
might fail or that small shareholders are left with shares that fall sharply
in value soon afterwards. The Argentine stock market has yet fully to digest
the effect of the price collapse of the shares of Telecom of Argentina after
a public offering in March 1992.
The government has decided that, unlike in many previous privatisations, it
will not sell a controlling stake in YPF to foreign operating companies.
This immediately raises the question of who will control the company after
the sale of its shares. Even though it will still be the largest stakeholder
 -the state will retain at least 20 per cent of the shares after the sale
with a further 5-10 per cent reserved for the workforce - the government has
promised that control will pass to the private sector. The Argentine
government seems to have had in mind a British-style privatisation in which
the management installed by the state remains in place. However, it is
possible that the new shareholders will prefer management led by someone
other than Mr Jose Estenssoro, despite the widespread credit he is given for
turning round the former loss-making company.
It will also want to avoid making the oil company the subject of a bid by
speculators, either foreign or domestic, whose aim would be to split up the
company in order to make short-term gains. Maximum stakes are, thus, likely
to be limited, although if the maximum is set too low it could put off some
potential buyers. Mr Russell Herbert, managing director of British Gas's
Global Gas division, says his company is interested in a stake in YPF, but
points out that it can make no decisions before it knows the terms of the
sale.
While this may be the government's most important single privatisation,
there are some in Buenos Aires who believe that it has increased the risk of
failure by going for an earlier-than-anticipated privatisation.
The timetable appears to have been guided by political rather than market
considerations, since a third quarter sale was previously considered likely.
Congressional elections are due in October and the government has promised
to use the proceeds from YPF to pay off arrears owed to pensioners payments
in the past.
A sale in early July means a frantic timetable for flotation's global
co-ordinators, First Boston and Merrill Lynch. Global investment
institutions will over the coming few months also have to digest other large
issues including the sale by the UK government of its remaining stake in
British Telecom.
The company was scheduled to file full details of the sale, including two
years of audited results of YPF, with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission in early June.
The assets of the company have been put loosely at Dollars 6bn-8bn. A banker
close to the transaction said that although the eventual outcome would
depend on the process of 'book building' - under which underwriters
determine demand for the shares at a range of prices - it was thought likely
that perhaps half the shares offered would go to the United States market,
20 per cent to the Argentine market and 30 per cent to the rest of the
world, mainly to Europe.
The flotation of Yacimientos Petroliferoos Fiscales on to the private market
may raise Dollars 3bn.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Argentina (1): A turn for the better - Argentina
has found its way, combining democratic rule with radical privatisation of
the economy. The challenge now is to make it work - and for the Menem
government to provide firm institutional foundations for political life
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TO THE visitor to Buenos Aires, today one of Latin America's most peaceful
capitals, it seems scarcely credible that little more than a decade ago
Argentina was under military rule.
Its bellicose generals had brought the country to the brink of war with
neighbouring Chile and into a disastrous conflict with Britain in the south
Atlantic. The military had abducted, tortured and murdered thousands of
Argentines under the pretext that Argentina's divided society demanded
strong government.
It seems scarcely believable either that four years ago, as the government
of President Carlos Menem took office, the country was in the middle of one
of its most severe economic crises of the century. With inflation rising to
200 per cent a month, commerce ground to a halt and people took to the
streets to protest against food shortages.
Today the military appears a spent force in Argentine politics. Instead of
fighting with its neighbours, the government is planning a customs union
with Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. The Clinton administration in the US has
opened the prospect of Argentina's accession to the North American Free
Trade Agreement.
The economy is enjoying a stability not seen for many years. Annual consumer
price inflation has fallen to single digits, the government has balanced its
budget, helped by a threefold rise in tax revenues between 1989 and 1992.
The government is close to completing one of the most radical privatisation
programmes ever seen, expected to culminate this year in the sale of the
largest company in Argentina, the state oil concern YPF.
Employment by the state and state-owned industry will have fallen from
290,000 at the end of 1989 to 41,000 at the end of 1993, according to
economist Miguel Broda.
The economy has enjoyed two years growth of close to 9 per cent and
industrial production is at record levels. Debate now rages between those
who doubt the change can endure - who see growth driven by a consumer boom
financed essentially by privatisation - and those who think Argentina could
be Latin America's new economic miracle.
The key to the debate is a law that has put the government into an economic
straitjacket. Since April 1991, the Argentine convertibility plan has put
the peso on a parity with the US dollar and allowed the central bank to
issue currency only if backed by foreign exchange reserves. By limiting the
government's ability to print money, the plan has brought down inflation
rapidly.
The architect of this programme is Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister,
a Harvard-trained economist whose writings demonstrate an obsession with
Argentina's economic decline in the 20th century.
Even some of Mr Cavallo's supporters - he is the most popular politician in
the government, according to opinion polls - wonder how long the peso's
parity with the dollar can be sustained. They point to a growing current
account deficit as evidence that the policy is eroding the competitiveness
of Argentine exports. Argentine consumer price inflation, while dropping, is
still running well ahead of US inflation, making foreign goods cheap in
Argentina but increasing the costs of exporters. The current account deficit
which the high exchange rate has caused, they argue, makes Argentina
dependent on highly volatile inflows of foreign capital.
Mr Cavallo, however, points out that capital has continued to flow into
Argentina this year, allowing interest rates to fall. More important, he
holds that it would be 'madness' to devalue: the competitive edge it would
give to exporters would be transitory as inflationary expectations, never
far from the surface in modern Argentina, climbed rapidly.
A strong currency is also vital to restructure the private sector so that
Argentine competitiveness can be enhanced. If it is to be successful, it
will require a revolutionary change in the attitudes of business people who
 -due to inflation and the protectionist wall that used to surround the
Argentine economy - were rarely forced to make tough decisions.
For their part, foreign investors have already shifted attitudes. Helped by
the relief negotiated on foreign debt in an accord completed in April,
Argentine borrowers have been re-admitted to the international financial
markets. Foreign companies - from Europe and elsewhere, including,
importantly, the US - have been actively participating in the privatisation
of state utilities.
However, it is too soon to say whether the private sector believes enough in
Argentine stability to start investing in new productive capacity to
stimulate exports, and in what sectors - apart from agriculture and energy -
the country's comparative advantage lies.
Despite these doubts, there appears to be a consensus that the general
direction of economic strategy is more or less right, though only the brave
would argue that this means the end of the deep conflicts that have marked
Argentine politics in the 20th Century. Mr Naldo Brunelli, new head of the
trade union confederation, CGT, says: 'We think that the changes are
irreversible.' Mr Cavallo has praised the two leading economists of the
opposition Radical party as men who would run the economy very well.
Argentina's new economic structure is being depicted increasingly as a
project of the state, not of Menem and Cavallo.
This should reduce the uncertainty surrounding the handover of government in
1995, although if Mr Menem has his way, he will succeed himself.
For this he will need a reform of the constitution, but that will require a
two-thirds majority in Congress and he can only get that in Congressional
elections in October.
Partly because of this, economic policy has been more expansive this year
than many expected. For example, a large part of the proceeds of the YPF
sale will go to clear arrears to pensioners. The YPF sale, it is widely
said, has been brought forward so that the pensioners can be paid before the
elections.
For his part, Mr Menem says he would like another term as president, but
adds: 'It's not an obsession.' Indeed, he has laid less emphasis on his
re-election in recent months, conscious perhaps that if he stresses the
theme and fails to win the necessary support he could turn relative
electoral success for the Peronists into a perceived failure.
Despite the widespread credit he is given for stabilising the economy, there
are some who doubt whether he is the man to deal with the next set of
challenges likely to face the Argentine government - the development of the
institutions of state that remain after privatisation. To critics, he is a
man more interested in the exercise of power than in the rules of the game.
Mr Luis Moreno Ocampo, a former federal prosecutor now in the private
sector, says: 'Just because we have elections, it doesn't mean there is
democracy.
'Of the rights guaranteed under the constitution, we have just two:
elections and freedom of opinion.' This means that concepts important to
democracy, such as respect for the rule of law and the independence of the
judiciary, are still lacking in Argentina.
A lack of public confidence in the judicial system also feeds a public
obsession with corruption in government. Much economic reform - the change
in the exchange rate regime, privatisation, the strict financial limitations
on the government - should reduce future opportunities for corruption.
Yet it still goes on. Past members of the presidential entourage stand
accused of corruption. A free press has heightened awareness of an issue
about which people feel increasing indignation because their taxes are
financing it.
This is not the only priority. As in most countries, education is a central
issue. Argentine labour is among the most expensive in Latin America. If
Argentina is to be successful as an exporter, productivity needs to be
improved through better education.
There is a danger, too, that the success of the economic reform will leave
some sectors of the population behind, particularly in those outlying
provinces whose governments have not followed the central government in
economic reform.
Yet, compared with most of its neighbours, Argentina's problems should be
relatively easy to tackle. High literacy and a reasonable income
distribution mark it out from much of the rest of Latin America. With its
natural resources, it should be a wealthy country.
The economic programme has, by shackling the government, resolved a central
paradox: why a deeply conservative population has been ruled for so long by
licentious governments.
The key to this change is a single piece of legislation: the law which fixes
the value of the peso against the US dollar. For some time to come,
confidence at home and abroad in Argentina's economy will hang on the single
thread of the convertibility law.
Things have turned dramatically for the better in Argentina but it is not
out of the woods yet.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Silver demand exceeds output in
1992
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD SILVER demand outstripped production and other new supply in 1992 for
the third consecutive year.
The deficit may have begun to support prices, according Mr. Jeffery
Christian, who presented the fourth annual World Silver Survey to New York
analysts yesterday.
Published by the Washington-based Silver Institute, the survey was prepared
by the research firm CPM Group, of which Mr. Christian is a managing
director. Despite the bullish tone contributed by gradually rising demand
for silver, however, other fundamental factors - including large world
stocks - overhang the silver market.
Silver prices continued a decade-old decline in 1992 and silver extraction,
which is often a by-product of copper, zinc, and other mining failed to
respond to lower prices.
Total silver supply rose 1.8 per cent to 501.7 m ounces in 1992, while
silver use for fabricated products rose 2.0 per cent to 590.3m ounces, a gap
of 88.6m ounces. Supply gains came from a 1.3 per cent increase in mine
production, and a 3.0 per cent increase in secondary supplies.
A decline in silver use in the US, Japan, and other industrialised countries
last year was more than offset by rising demand in the countries of Asia,
particularly India.
The report projects fabricated silver demand to rise 5.9 per cent in 1993,
to 625.0m ounces and new supply to drop 4 per cent to 481.8m ounces.
Although secondary sources of silver will continue to increase this year,
the survey projects mine production, excluding countries with non-market
economies, to decline 6.3 per cent to 339.8m ounces.
Mine output in the US, Canada and Peru is forecast to fall, while Mexico,
the world's largest silver producer, is expected to continue production at
about 65m ounces this year.
While China was the biggest buyer of gold last year, ithas had little
influence on world silver statistics, Mr. Christian said.

venture
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
La Rosa, wholly owned by Bolivian mining group Emusa and individual
enterpreneurs has signed an exploration joint venture with Billiton, part of
the Royal Dutch Shell oil group. Exploration work is expected to start in
the next few weeks. The contract covers the Don Mario ore body in tropical
eastern Bolivia. Preliminary exploration, including bore holes, have
revealed an estimated 7m tonnes at ore reserves in total. The ore body is a
polymetallic mix of copper, gold and silver. The contract should have a
duration of 2 to 3 years, with production starting in up to 6 years. Shell
has had an offer for Billiton from Gencor, the South African group, but
Emusa believes the La Rosa deal will not be affected.
Pan-Andean Resources, a British quoted company, was yesterday signing a
major oil exploration joint venture with YPFB, the Bolivian state
hydrocarbons group. Mr John J. Teeling, Pan-Andean chairman, said the joint
venture covers 1.39m hectares in the tropical Chapare region in central
Bolivia. The contract is for 30 years.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar price down further
despite lower Cuban crop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINAL CONFIRMATION that Cuba's sugar crop will be only 4.2m tonnes compared
with last year's 7m tonnes did not prevent a further decline in New York raw
sugar prices, writes David Blackwell.
In late trading yesterday the July contract was down 0.63 at 11.15 cents a
lb - well off the high of 13.26 on May 17.
The fall came in spite of Monday night's announcement from Cubazucar, which
put the outcome of the troubled harvest well below all recent trade
estimates. Czarnikow, the London trade house, last week estimated Cuban
production at 5.5m tonnes, a figure matched this week by ED &amp; F. Man, also
of London.
Production in Cuba, the world's biggest exporter, has been hit by bad
weather and problems with the country's crumbling infrastructure.
Falls in production in Cuba, Thailand and India have led to early
predictions of a world surplus this year being changed to predictions of a
deficit, averaging around 2m tonnes below consumption.
This has been enough to drive prices sharply higher after a flat period
between last September and February, when nearby New York traded between 8
and 9 cents a lb.
However, the market has eased back recently as physical demand for sugar has
not been evident, partly because of the high prices.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian oil joint venture
partners in crisis meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PARTNERS in Russia's foremost joint venture in the vital oil sector meet
today in the city of Raduzhny in the Tyumen region to decide whether or not
to continue an increasingly fractious - and apparently unprofitable -
relationship.
White Knights,a joint enterprise between the state-owned oil company
Varyeganneftegas (50 per cent), the Phibro Energy subsidiary of Salomon
Brothers (45 per cent), and Anglo-Suisse (5 per cent) has in little over two
years produced some oil but seems to be drowning in irreconcilable
differences between the main partners, Varyeganneftegas and Phibro.
The outcome of the last-ditch talks today will be closely watched by the oil
majors, all of which are trying to establish toe-holds in the Russian market
but none of which have made really major investments because of continuing
confusion over the law, taxes and - above all - the attitude of Russian
production companies and the government.
Phibro has alleged that the Russian side had threatened to halt payment of
contracts, to stop payment of US workers on the site, to confiscate half of
the production of the enteprise and stop efforts to obtain the necessary
licenses and export tax exemptions.
Mr Robert Baker, a spokesman for the parent company Salomon, said earlier
this month that 'These steps, if taken, would destroy our investment,
destroy the economic base of the project and cause it to close down'. The
company has warned the industry that if it feels itself forced to break off
the two-year co-operation, it will endeavour to broadcast widely its version
of the reasons for failure.
The US company has spent some Dollars 115m on the project, which presently
produces 8,000 barrels of crude a day. Mr Robert Denham, chairman of
Salomon, has told Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury Secretary, that the
action contemplated by Varyeganneftegas was 'theft' and asked him to make
clear to the Russians that the government's actions 'are inconsistent with
the fundamental premises of US economic assistance'.
Phibro's investment represents probably the largest sum put into the Russian
oil industry by a foreign company to date - though the feasibility study
conducted off the coast of Sakhalin in the far east by a US-Japanese
consortium including Shell and Mitsui is understood to have cost around
Dollars 100m. The French oil company Elf-Aquitaine is also to make a
medium-sized investment in the Volga region.
The failure of Phibro would be a major blow for foreign hopes that the
Russians are willing to see foreign companies operate with relative freedom.
All oil majors complain that they suffer from high and constantly changing
tax rates and from a lack of interest from the Russian side in allowing
profitable exploitation.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Supreme Court's sword over
Comibol - A judgement crucial for foreign investment in Bolivian mining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS PHILIPSBORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bolivia's Supreme Court is expected to rule shortly on the legality of joint
ventures between two private companies and Comibol, the state mining
corporation. The decision will be watched closely by the country's mining
industry since it may put the final nail in the coffin of Bolivia's attempts
to attract foreign investment to its beleaguered public mining sector.
The private companies whose joint venture deals with Comibol are being
scrutinised by the Supreme Court are Cominesa, a subsidiary of Specialty
Metals of the US, which made a bid for the Tasna bismuth/gold mine, and
Mineracao Taboca, a subsidiary of Brazil's Paranapanema, which wishes to
exploit the Kenko tin tailings of the Catavi-Siglo XX mine.
Neither company has been able to start operations because of union
opposition but it had been hoped that a new government after general
elections on June 6 would have dealt with the issue and cleared the way for
work to begin. It is now possible, however, that an unfavourable decision by
the Supreme Court could annul the contracts altogether. In the mining
industry it is believed that this may well be the likely outcome.
The difficulty with both contracts is the failure of the Bolivian government
to issue supreme decrees to ratify each joint venture - necessary because
Comibol is state-owned. The mining unions took the matter to court after
they had discovered that the proper procedures had, allegedly, not been
followed.
The government subsequently tried to issue back-dated decrees but the
attempt was discovered and blocked. This is the latest in a series of
blunders by the government of President Jaime Paz Zamora which have done
little to foster confidence in the country's public mining sector.
The real danger for the country's mining industry is clearly spelled out by
Mr Armundo Guzman, Comibol's new executive director, who thinks that a
decision against the existing joint venture contracts would be 'crazy.'
'It would stop all foreign investment from coming to Bolivia,' he says.
Mr Guzman believes that the government has acted within the framework of the
constitution. Several industry figures are not so certain.
A negative ruling from the court would be a severe blow not just for private
investment but for Comibol itself. Mr Guzman, who came to the corporation in
January, says the group might have to close all but one of its mining
centres by the year's end. Comibol has made a loss of over Dollars 672m
since 1980 and has been hard hit by the fall in the international market
price for base metals, particularly zinc.
The collapse in the International Tin Council buffer stock operation in l985
convinced Comibol to shift the bulk of its production from tin to zinc, but
it has failed to secure the long-term contracts which have shielded some
private Bolivian zinc producers from the price slide.
Already, San Vincente, a zinc-silver mine, and San Jose, a lead-silver mine,
have closed. Mr Guzman says others due for closure shortly include
Unificada, a silver-zinc mine, and Colquiri, a tin-zinc mine. The only
Comibol mine likely to escape the cuts is Huanuni, which produces high grade
tin ore destined for the corporation's Vinto smelter.
Quite apart from the closure of the corporation's mines, however, perhaps
the strongest indictment of this government's handling of the public sector
mining industry is that, under an agreement with unions, all workers
employed in Comibol mines which have ceased production will continue to
receive full pay and benefits indefinitely, thus greatly reducing the
corporation's ability to cut costs and improve efficiency.
Comibol now finds itself in a Catch 22 situation which may be further
aggravated by the pending Supreme Court decision. The corporation has an
increasing stockpile of 'dirty' zinc ores heavily contaminated with
antimony, which it cannot sell. Its productive mines are fast running out of
high grade ores and virtually no new reserves have been developed. Low grade
reserves can be exploited only if there is an upturn in zinc prices, which
remains unlikely.
The corporation is therefore trying to switch production back to tin, but it
is unable to do this, or to develop new reserves, without foreign
investment. This is precisely why the prospect of an unfavourable decision
by the Supreme Court strikes fear into the hearts of Comibol executives,
since it would, in the words of one industry observer, 'worsen the already
tarnished image of the government and Comibol with foreign investors' and
condemn the remainder of the corporation's mining operations to indefinite
closure.
According to industry sources, Comibol has over 2,000 ore deposits. This
fact alone will ensure that foreign and private capital will continue to
take an interest in joint ventures with it. But the state-owned
corporation's great handicap has been its high political profile and
inescapable links to the government of the day.
Comibol can only continue hoping for an enlightened administration which
will allow it the freedom fully to exploit its remarkable potential.

On the London bullion market GOLD failed to build on overnight gains in New
York, and lost ground on trade selling in Europe. Dealers said that the US
funds did not seem interested in buying in New York, even on the dips down
to Dollars 370 a troy ounce. Without fund buying, a bout of trade selling in
Europe was enough to weaken the price. Three-month COPPER hit profit taking
and technical resistance between Dollars 1,850 and Dollars 1,860 a tonne on
the LME, and prices eased. Technically, the market is still trading within a
band between Dollars 1,820 and Dollars 1,850, dealers said. ALUMINIUM perked
up in late kerb trade, aided by news that unions involved in Alcoa and
Reynolds Metals talks had voted to authorise possible strikes. But traders
say a strike is unlikely, and as hedge cover has been put in place, the
market is more likely to ease if new labour contracts are agreed. London
COCOA futures continued to drift in a narrow band with the market still
hovering just above a recent seven-month low. There was little reaction to
ED &amp; F. Man's increased deficit forecast for 1992-93 to 124,000 tonnes from
a March estimate of 118,000 tonnes.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC farm ministers close to new
price package accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, SOFIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER THREE days of negotiations, EC agriculture ministers were last night
close to agreeing a farm price package for this year, which in the view of
the European Commission maintains the integrity of the radical reform of the
Common Agricultural Policy decided last May.
Ministers were still battling, however, over the regime for 'set-aside'  -
land to be taken out of production as one of the main means of reining in
over-production.
A compromise devised by the Danish presidency of the EC and the European
Commission retains what Brussels regards as essential to safeguard the CAP
reform, Commission officials claimed.
France had sought significant changes to the set-aside rules. It wanted a 50
per cent increase in compensation to cereal and oilseed farmers.
A more likely outcome last night seemed between 25 and 30 per cent - an
increase of Ecu12 per tonne rather than Ecu20, the rise sought by Paris.
France linked this demand to the EC-US agreement on oilseeds reached last
November, which staved off a trans-Atlantic trade war and in principle
settled most of the farm chapter of the long-stalled Uruguay Round to reform
world trade rules.
France, along with Ireland, also wants to raise the weight limits on beef
carcasses eligible for subsidised stockpiling, reduced under CAP reform to
help cut back the EC's 1.1m tonnes beef mountain.
The Commission was still holding the line last night on this demand, arguing
that what had been agreed under last year's reform was already manifestly
insufficient to rein in beef overproduction.
The UK was also resisting a Commission proposal to increase the standard 15
per cent set-aside requirement, on a five year rotational basis, to 20 per
cent in the case of land which is not rotated.
Brussels yesterday agreed to reduce the fixed set-aside requirement to 18
per cent, but only in areas where less nitrate fertilizer is used, under a
regime agreed in 1991.
The Commission reckons the net result in production terms would be the same.
Mr John Gummer, UK agriculture minister, argues that the increased fertility
resulting from rotational fallowing of land reduces output by less than
fixed set-aside.
'Both systems have disadvantages but the Commission dwells on one of them,'
he said, referring to Brussels' concern about farmers setting aside their
most marginal land.
'All our experience shows that these two systems net off,' Mr Gummer added.
The Commission maintains that while this has traditionally been the case,
advances in fertilizer and pesticide technology, along with genetic
improvements in seeds, have all but elimnated the yield differences between
continuously planted areas and land revitalised by fallowing.
True to their tradition of all-week, all-night negoitation on
micro-adjustment of CAP rules to bolster national farm interests, the
agriculture ministers looked set to reach a denouement late last night or in
the early hours of this morning.
After last May's epic negotiations of the CAP reform, it had been fondly
thought that no more than management and tinkering would be needed. The
Commission now realises that it has a battle on its hands to make the reform
work. Bulgaria expects to lose tens of millions of dollars as a result of a
ban on meat and livestock exports imposed by the government after an
outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, Reuter reports from Sofia.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: Renewed foreign interest boosts Pounds 3bn
gilt auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE UK government bond market gave a warm response to the Bank of England's
Pounds 3bn gilt auction yesterday, with stock in the auction area gaining
about  3/8 of a point.
At the average accepted price, the yield on the 7 3/4 per cent gilt due 2006
was 8.39 per cent, and the tail, the difference between the average and
highest accepted yield, was zero.
'The tail tells the story,' one economist said. It was a better sign of the
auction's success than the cover, which at 1.56 times was a little lower
than expectations of 1.6 to 1.7 times.
Partly because of the much more realistic expectations, this auction was
much better received than the last one, which was 1.77 times covered.
One of the positive factors was renewed foreign interest. Gilts'
underperformance of continental European markets, notably France, over the
past few weeks had creative an attractive yield differential.
The strengthening of the pound and less anxiety about inflation also
provided a much more favourable background.
The best performance came at the longer end, with 10-year stock and beyond
gaining about  3/8 points. The 'when issued' price on the new gilt went up
about  1/2 point. This was, however, the area of the market which had seen
the most underperformance ahead of the auction.
SOME puzzlement at the Spanish government bond market's lack of reaction to
the plummeting peseta raised concern that longer-dated stock might open
lower today.
One economist described the government bond market as being 'out of sync'
with currency movements and with pre-election talk of more interest rate
cuts.
GERMAN bunds lost much of the ground gained since Monday in late
profit-taking yesterday.
Initially, another mildly positive state inflation figure helped sentiment,
but it was not enough to prevent a correction to the sharp rise that
occurred earlier this week.
As expected, the Bundesbank left the repo rate unchanged at 7.60 per cent
and that had little effect on the market. However, the need to support the
D-Mark has weakened hopes that the council will cut key rates next week and
this exerted a more negative influence.
Z
NEWS of flat durable goods orders, a strong five-year auction and declining
metals and commodity prices combined to boost longer-dated US Treasury bond
prices sharply yesterday.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  31/32 at 102
3/8 , yielding 6.932 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was slightly firmer, up  1/8 at 99 29/32 , to yield 4.158 per cent.
The day's economic news was bullish for bonds. It showed no change in
durable goods orders last month - analysts had been expecting a rise in
orders of up to 1 per cent.
The figures, which suggested that the economy continues to struggle to gain
meaningful momentum, buoyed bond prices at the long end of the market.
Later in the day, surprisingly strong demand for the Dollars 11bn five-year
auction provided prices with an extra lift, as did falling gold, silver and
commodity prices.
THE yen's rise to an all-time high against the dollar provided further
impetus to the Japanese government bond market.
The combination of the soaring currency and the success of Tuesday's 10-year
bond auction, which looked relatively cheap, provided bullish conditions in
spite of the rise in the Nikkei stock market index. Domestic institutions,
which had been sitting on their hands recently, sprung into life.
With the 10-year area attracting particular interest after the recent
sell-off, the yield curve flattened. Between three and 10-year stock, the
yield spread came down by half a dozen basis points.
In the cash market, the yield of the benchmark No 145 due 2002 came down
from 4.63 per cent to 4.575 per cent during Tokyo trading, while the price
of the September futures contract rose from 106.60 to 107.

FT  27 MAY 93 / International Bonds: Britannia launches unusual four-year
floating-rate note
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BORROWERS flocked to the Eurobond market in a variety of currencies, using
fixed and floating-rate instruments yesterday.
Britannia Building Society launched an unusual floating-rate deal which
Samuel Montagu, the lead manager, structured to provide separate additional
detachable interest rights, or ADIRs.
The Pounds 100m, four-year deal had an issue price of 100 for the whole
package, consisting of 99.71 for the notes and coupon and 0.29 for the
ADIRs.
It is understood that the lead manager kept the ADIRs, which it pointed out
are 'instruments likely to appeal to financial institutions'.
The coupon is three-month Libor plus 15 basis points, and the ADIRs entitle
the holder to receive 5 per cent minus three-month Libor if three-month
Libor falls below 5 per cent.
The lead manager said the instruments would be of interest to investors who
think Libor will be less than 5 per cent (three-month Libor is currently 6
per cent).
Barclays Bank also tapped the sterling sector, raising a further Pounds 100m
tranche of perpetual, subordinated debt (known as upper tier two capital)
following its initial Pounds 200m deal in early April.
The latest tranche was priced to yield 135 basis points over the 9 per cent
gilt due 2008, whereas the initial tranche had a yield spread of 140 basis
points at launch and tightened to 131 basis points in the secondary market.
The debt is callable at par after 15 years and if it is not called the
coupon will be refixed - either at the current level of 9.875 per cent or at
240 basis points over the five-year benchmark gilt, whichever of those is
higher.
BZW, the lead manager, said the decision to issue a further tranche was made
in response to strong investor demand, particularly in the UK. In the course
of the day it rose from the fixed re-offer price of 98.951 to 99.0625.
Elsewhere, Compagnie Bancaire, the specialised financial business owned by
Paribas, aimed its five-year Ecu100m deal at the retail sector.
While the Danish referendum result a week ago was greeted as good news for
the Ecu bond sector, there has not been much new issuance in Ecu since then.
The deal is expected to be well-received given the shortage of current
coupon Ecu paper.
Daimler-Benz International Finance tapped the Eurobond market with a L125bn,
seven-year deal and is understood to be keeping the lira proceeds.
The deal saw good demand in Germany, Benelux and Switzerland from investors
who are familiar with this blue-chip name. The borrower has tapped the lira
sector before. Deutsche Bank, the book-runner for the deal, said it looked
at recent seven-year lira issues for reference, and the deal was priced to
yield 10.63 per cent.

FT  27 MAY 93 / International Equity Issues: Rise in activity in convertible
paper sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONVERTIBLE bond market has seen a pick-up in activity, with deals from
Amer of Finland, Ericsson of Sweden, and Societe Generale in recent days.
Further deals are expected soon, with Lend Lease, the Australian financial
services group rumoured to be considering a Dollars 200m Euro-convertible
bond.
Investment bankers point out that, with the outlook for some of the European
stock markets seen as 'rather uncertain', convertible bonds can provide
investors with a more 'defensive' investment instrument.
Amer, the Finnish consumer goods group, has announced terms for a Dollars
75m Euro-convertible bond issue, the first time such an instrument has been
launched by a Finnish company.
The coupon on the 10-year bond will be 6.25 per cent, and its conversion
price into Amer A shares will be FM144. This represents an 18 per cent
premium to Tuesday's closing price of FM122 on the Helsinki stock exchange.
The proceeds are being used to strengthen the group's balance sheet and to
raise the European profile of its Wilson Sporting Goods arm, which is
already well-known in the US.
The issue, which is being lead-managed by NatWest Securities and
Postipankki, is being targeted at international investors in Europe and the
US, where the bonds were placed under a Rule 144a private placing.
Societe Generale hopes to raise FFr3bn with its global offering of deep
discount convertible bonds. The bonds are priced at FFr660 and are repayable
at FFr800 at maturity.
Shareholders in Societe Generale have priority subscription rights on
FFr1.5bn of the bonds.

FT  27 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Pemex raises Dollars 366m in
asset securitisation debut
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PETROLEOS Mexicanos, Mexico's state oil company, has raised Dollars 366m in
an asset securitisation deal. The privately-placed debt, which has a
maturity of 7 1/2 years, is backed by revenues from future oil exports and
marks the first time Pemex has used such revenues to guarantee its debt.
The securitised debt has a single-A rating from Standard &amp; Poor's, the US
rating agency. This is the first time S&amp;P has given an investment grade
rating to long-term uncollateralised Mexican debt. Pemex will pay 165 basis
points over US Treasury bills for the debt, which was placed with US
institutions earlier this week. The deal was lead-managed by Citibank.
The negotiations over the securitised debt took nearly two years to
complete. Within Mexico, the question of whether Pemex should back debt with
future oil revenues is a sensitive one. Mexico's oil industry was
nationalised in 1938, and the regulatory law that governs Pemex prohibits it
from selling rights to oil reserves. The securitisation does not explicitly
commit Pemex to produce or export oil, and is therefore legal.
Pemex is expected to take advantage of more securitisation of debt now that
the first issue has been successfully placed. It is also working on the
securitisation of US Eximbank export credits for a Dollars 250m debt issue
to develop the Sonda de Campeche oil field, according to a report in El
Financiero newspaper.

dealings

<TEXT>
THE Paris stock market authorities have called in police to investigate
share dealings in Yves Saint-Laurent, the French fashion house, prior to the
announcement of a sharp fall in six-month profits last autumn. Dealings in
YSL, which has been rocked by controversy since its FFr3.6bn (Dollars 650m)
takeover earlier this year by the Elf-Sanofi pharmaceuticals group, have for
some months been under investigation by the Commission des Operations de
Bourse (COB), the stock market watchdog.
The COB yesterday said 'a significant number of YSL shares' were bought in
off-market dealings by foreign investors in the weeks before the publication
of the company's interim results on September 21.
These revealed an unexpectedly steep fall in net profits from FFr2.6bn in
the first half of 1991 to FFr41m in the same period last year.
French market sources suggest that 2 per cent of YSL's shares changed hands
on September 17 and September 18.

<TEXT>
COMPAQ Computer expects a strong second-quarter performance.
Mr Andreas Barth, senior vice-president, Europe, said his forecast was based
on the first signs of economic recovery in Europe and the surge in demand
generated by the introduction of the 486SL-based Compaq Contura and Compaq
LTE Lite notebook ranges in March and May.
First-quarter net income, reported last month, jumped to Dollars 102m, or
Dollars 1.23 a share, from Dollars 45m, or 53 cents, on revenues 106 per
cent higher at Dollars 1.6bn.
The company confirmed in a statement that it took the lead in the European
portable PC market for the first time in the quarter. The group held a 22
per cent market share in value terms and a 17.5 per cent market share in
unit terms, according to Dataquest, a market research business.

SEAGRAM, the Canadian drinks group, has acquired 5.7 per cent of Time
Warner, the US media group, but said yesterday the holding was 'solely for
purposes of investment'.
The disclosure came in filings with US regulators which sought approval for
Seagram to buy up to 15 per cent of Time Warner's shares outstanding.
The 21.12m shares acquired so far were bought in a series of open-market
purchases from February 2. Time Warner closed at Dollars 38, up Dollars 1
3/8 .
Mr Edgar Bronfman, Seagram chairman, said the company believed the media and
entertainment business was one of the great growth sectors for the 1990s and
beyond.
Last week, US West, the 'Baby Bell' telephone company based in Denver,
agreed to invest Dollars 2.5bn in Time Warner's entertainment business and
jointly manage the innovative multi-media home entertainment service Time
Warner is planning.
Seagram also has a 24 per cent stake in Du Pont, the US chemicals company.

FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Amax deal enriches Cyprus
Minerals' core - Laurie Morse examines prospects of a new power in the coal
and copper industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Milton Ward, chairman of Cyprus Minerals, has enhanced his reputation as
something of a corporate fox. On Tuesday, he snapped up the assets of
undervalued Amax, the US mining group, at a point when analysts believe
copper and aluminium markets could be close to the bottom.
Mr Ward and his Amax counterpart, Mr Allen Born, agreed to a merger as Amax
struggled with Dollars 2.54bn in long-term debt, declining revenues from
sagging metals prices, and lack of sufficient capital to expand its core
business.
Both men are respected veterans of the mining business, and their alliance,
analysts say, show they are taking a realistic view of world competition and
market conditions.
'We are going to see more of these strategic alliances within the mining
industry, as companies cope with the globalisation of the business and the
effect the collapse of the CIS has had on world commodity prices,' says Mr
Vahid Fathi, analyst with Kemper Securities in Chicago. 'Mining is in a very
dynamic situation right now.'
Mr Ward, who moved to Cyprus a year ago after nearly two decades at the US
natural resource company Freeport McMoRan, has earned a reputation as an
effective cost-cutter.
He and Mr Born, who went to Amax from Placer Dome, will share the new
company's chairmanship, but Mr Ward will be chief executive officer.
In acquiring Amax and creating Cyprus-Amax, Mr Ward has continued to focus
on two primary businesses - coal and copper. The deal involves the exchange
of one Cyprus share for two Amax, subject to adjustments for price
fluctuations in Cyprus stock.
The new company will be North America's second-largest copper producer, with
reserves of 2.6bn tons of mineable ore. Last year, Cyprus produced 660m
pounds of copper, and has a Dollars 200m capital expenditure programme under
way to reduce copper production costs.
From Amax, Cyprus will get 1bn tonnes of new coal reserves and, combined,
the two companies will produce about 60m tons of coal annually. Cyprus will
add its new 40 per cent interest in Australia's McIlwraith McEacharn to the
deal. That company, whose markets are mainly Pacific Rim countries, produces
11m tons of coal a year.
Cyprus-Amax will also have a 40 per cent stake in Amax Gold, which has
annual production of about 250,000 ounces and reserves of about 8.6m ounces.
Cyprus has shed some gold operations in Australia and New Zealand, but gold
will be included in the combined company's commodity portfolio. Cyprus is
already in talks to acquire several high grade gold deposits in locations
around the world.
The new company will also have dominant positions in lithium, which is used
in aluminum smelting, and molybdenum, used as an alloy in steelmaking.
Amax's oil and natural gas subsidiary will be part of the merger, but Mr
Ward admits the business is not a good fit with his commodity strategy.
Notably, the new company will not have aluminium operations. Amax's large
Alumax arm will be spun off independently to Amax shareholders before the
merger.
'It is a very nicely structured deal. Cyprus didn't have to take the
aluminum business,' says Mr Tom Hess, research analyst with Northern Trust
Co.
With most metals markets in the middle of a 13-year decline, analysts say
the Cyprus/Amax deal has substantial potential once metals prices begin to
recover. In the meantime, Dollars 100m in immediate cost savings are
projected, through staff redundancies and closing Amax's New York office.
The merger will also allow a fresh look at Amax's remaining businesses,
which Mr Ward is expected to streamline, aiming to be a lowest cost
producer, as he has done at Cyprus.
'Milton Ward is going to have huge potential to the upside over the next
several years, and very little potential for downside. If metals prices go
lower, other companies, with higher costs, will be forced to curtail
production first,' notes Mr Hess.
Amax's Alumax spin-off is receiving close Wall Street scrutiny. 'It will be
a pure aluminum play,' says SG Warburg metals analyst Mr. Victor Lazarovici.
'It has more primary metal to sell in proportion to its size than any other
company.' While the company recorded an operating loss in 1992 because of
expenses related to the start up of its new Quebec smelter, Alumax, which
turned in Dollars 2.4bn in sales last year. is one of the world's lowest
cost aluminium producers.
It is valued at around Dollars 850m. If aluminium prices rise 30 per cent,
that valuation could jump to about Dollars 1.6bn, analysts say, and such
market responsiveness could, they add, make it a popular bet on the
direction of the world economy.

TANDY, one of largest US consumer electronics retailers and manufacturers,
yesterday abandoned plans to spilt itself into two independently-quoted
companies - one representing its retail operations and the other its
manufacturing arm.
Instead, the Texas-based group said it would sell part of its personal
computer manufacturing operations to AST Research, a California-based
manufacturer of IBM-compatible desktop and notebook computers, and then
divest much of the remaining manufacturing business.
'Our primary strategic thrust is retailing, as previously announced,' said
Mr John Roach, Tandy's chairman.
AST said the purchase price for the PC assets was estimated to be no more
than Dollars 175m, which would be met either in cash and three-year
promissory notes or entirely in cash.
The operations it plans to buy include the GRiD brand of products,
Tandy-GRiD Europe, and certain computer manufacturing plants in Texas and
Scotland.
GRiD Systems, which Tandy acquired in 1987, is believed to have lost money
recently and has been retrenching after an ambitious expansion programme.
Its president recently resigned.
Tandy will take a charge of around Dollars 70m in the second quarter to
end-June as a result of this divestment. The company announced in January it
planned to divide itself into two separately-quoted companies - with the
manufacturing arm being known as TE Electronics.
Shareholders would have received shares in TE Electronics as a tax-free
'dividend'.
Yesterday, Mr Roach said Tandy had decided the sale route would strengthen
its balance sheet and increase future income potential. The company would
retain 'limited strategic manufacturing units', he said, although these were
not detailed.
Mr Roach has being putting a good deal of emphasis on Tandy's efforts to
revive its big retail operation. On the one hand, it has developed a new
'superstore' concept called 'The Incredible Universe', and opened the first
two outlets - both about 150,000 sq. ft. - last year. But the Texas company
also plans to open a series of 'small stores', under the 'Radio Shack
Express' fascia.

BANK of Montreal and Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada's third and fourth-biggest
banks respectively, set the ball rolling on Canadian banks' second-quarter
earnings reports yesterday, with BMO posting the stronger performance.
Its earnings climbed by 21 per cent, but Bank of Nova Scotia's income edged
up only fractionally. BNS suffered a sharp drop in return on shareholders
equity. BMO's earnings rose to CDollars 173m (USDollars 136m), or 63 cents a
share, in the quarter to April 30 from CDollars 143m, or 53 cents, a year
earlier. Return on shareholders equity climbed to 14.2 per cent from 13 per
cent. Loan loss provisions widened to CDollars 163m from CDollars 125m, but
the level of non-performing loans at the end of the quarter was 14 per cent
lower than three months previously.
The bank's loan-loss forecast for 1993 remains at CDollars 650m, up from
CDollars 550m last year.
The stronger second-quarter performance was ascribed to a 7 per cent growth
in loan volumes and the receipt of CDollars 24m before tax from the sale of
non-performing Brazilian bonds.
Bank of Nova Scotia's second-quarter earnings were CDollars 172m, up from
CDollars 171m. Per-share earnings dipped to 71 cents from 75 cents, while
return on equity fell to 14.2 per cent from 16.4 per cent.

COMPAQ Computer expects a strong second-quarter performance, the company
said yesterday.
Mr Andreas Barth, senior vice-president, Europe, said his forecast was based
on the first signs of economic recovery in Europe and the surge in demand
generated by the introduction of the 486SL-based Compaq Contura and Compaq
LTE Lite notebook ranges in March and May.
First-quarter net income, reported last month, jumped to Dollars 102m, or
Dollars 1.23 a share, from Dollars 45m, or 53 cents, on revenues 106 per
cent higher at Dollars 1.6bn.
The company confirmed in a statement that it took the lead in the European
portable PC market for the first time in the quarter. The group held a 22
per cent market share in value terms and a 17.5 per cent market share in
unit terms, according to Dataquest, a market research business.
First-quarter portable shipments grew by 89 per cent over the same period
last year, more than four times faster than the market, which increased by
21 per cent, the company said.
Mr Barth said the company would continue to target the European market with
product introductions and aggressive pricing.
In North America, Compaq's portables market share rose by 65 per cent,
reaching 17.6 per cent for the first quarter, against 11.4 per cent at the
end of last year.
The company's success in notebooks contrasts with that of rival Dell
Computer, which on Tuesday reported a steep fall in first-quarter income as
a result of delayed and cancelled notebook projects.
Novell, the US computer networking company,
released second-quarter figures showing net income up 31 per cent to Dollars
80m, or 26 cents a share, on revenue 25 per cent ahead at Dollars 281m.

FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Time to weed garden of
electronic delight - Toshiba's response to a three-year profit slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Tsuyoshi Kawanishi, senior executive vice-president of Toshiba, becomes
animated as he outlines the challenges facing his company and all of Japan's
electronics industry.
'In the 21st century, the electronics industry will change,' he says.
'Toshiba will have to change, too, if it is to maintain its leading edge in
the new environment.'
From his office on the 38th floor of Toshiba's headquarters building in
Tokyo, Mr Kawanishi enjoys a panoramic view of the city harbour under
development and the densely-populated suburban landscape that stretches
towards Mt Fuji - reminders of Japan's hectic growth over the past decade.
But, just as the frenzied development that spread through Tokyo in the late
1980s has ground to a virtual halt, Toshiba has had to face a slump in its
markets in the past few years.
The second-largest of Japan's comprehensive electric machinery
manufacturers, with products ranging from nuclear power generators to laptop
computers, Toshiba has been hit by the downturn in corporate and consumer
spending that has afflicted many of Japan's key industries.
The slowdown in demand is not expected to be reversed soon. Nor is the
recovery, when it comes, likely to bring back the days when demand for
electronic goods seemed insatiable.
To cope, the company, which employs 168,000 worldwide, has undertaken a
wide-ranging restructuring of its operations. The need is pressing; when
Toshiba reports its results today, it is likely to unveil a plunge in
consolidated pre-tax profits for the third year running to Y85bn (Dollars
773m), with net profits falling to Y20bn, or less than one-sixth of their
level three years ago.
After the three-year slide in profits, Toshiba and other Japanese
electronics companies are concerned their business environment is undergoing
fundamental changes requiring a comprehensive review of how they do
business.
Mr Kawanishi sees Japanese electronics companies being forced to abandon
aspects of their traditional management practices, such as emphasising
market share over profits.
There is little likelihood, for instance, that they will be able to continue
to rely on growing markets to increase profits. Instead, they will have to
place a greater emphasis on return on investment.
The cost of funding has risen since it has become difficult to raise capital
on the Japanese equity market. This means companies have to be much more
selective in their investments than a few years ago when they competed to
invest in new equipment and businesses.
Additionally, the effects of international trade friction, the need to bring
new products to market speedily and spiralling costs mean that companies
must set up transnational alliances to improve co-ordination between their
core skills and realise their potential.
'To take advantage of those changes we need to restructure our
organisation,' Mr Kawanishi says.
Toshiba is putting together a five-year business plan. This follows a review
of its businesses aimed at weeding out those not making returns and at
determining which areas the company will remain committed to.
'There are businesses that never made a profit and those that once made
profits but no longer do,' Mr Kawanishi admits. One example is cathode ray
tubes, which have not been profitable for Toshiba but have been manufactured
because they contribute to its television business.
Although retrenchment is anathema to Japanese business, Toshiba has begun
offloading some of its less profitable businesses as opportunities arise.
Last month, it revealed it had sold its 69 per cent stake in Onkyo, a
specialised audio manufacturer, to a medium-sized auto-parts maker. In
March, it reduced its stake in Toshiba Steel Tube from 50 to 25 per cent
when its subsidiary was merged with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon
Steel.
Meanwhile, it has concentrated investment in strategic product areas such as
flash memories, in which it has a tie-up with IBM.
A semiconductor memory chip plant in central Japan, which started producing
this month, will give Toshiba the capacity to double its 4-megabit D-Ram
output. As Mr Barry Dargan, analyst at S G Warburg Securities, points out,
it makes Toshiba the world's largest producer of memories just as the memory
chip market emerges from a prolonged slump and prices are rising strongly.
Mr Dargan says its strength in flash memory chips, which store information
even when the power is turned off and do so much faster than disk drives,
will pay off as the market for flash memories grows.
But prospects are still uncertain in many of Toshiba's business areas as
demand remains weak, particularly in Japan, while the yen's strength
continues to cast a cloud over its overseas income.
Toshiba also has a high level of net debt, at Y731bn, or almost 62 per cent
of equity. Yet it is still committed to maintaining its costly lifetime
employment system and will employ about as many graduates next year as it
always has.
As it pulls itself out of the slump and prepares for recovery, much depends
on how far Toshiba can change from the old ways to concentrate instead on
businesses which will earn the biggest returns.

FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Fanuc blames economy for 44%
slide in pre-tax profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FANUC, the Japanese machine tool maker, blamed a 44 per cent fall in pre-tax
profit to Y29.2bn in the year to March on the curtailing of capital spending
by manufacturers and the yen's appreciation.
Sales during the year fell 24.4 per cent to Y117.7bn, with those of factory
automation equipment 27.3 per cent lower and robot sales 21.5 per cent down.
Orders in the two areas were equally weak, though the company is hoping for
a 1.9 per cent rise in sales this year.
Fanuc, like other Japanese machinery companies, suffered from continued
trimming of corporate capital spending and by depreciation charges on their
own expansion of production during the late 1980s. Most Japanese
manufacturers now have under-utilised production lines and little incentive
to buy the sort of equipment in which Fanuc specialises.
For the current year, Fanuc forecasts a further fall of 6 per cent in
pre-tax profit to Y27.6bn, though the appreciation of the yen in recent
weeks is likely to put further pressure on its profits in coming months.
Hitachi Construction Machinery's pre-tax profits slipped 39.6 per cent to
Y2.7bn, but the company expects an increase in infrastructure spending by
the government to push domestic sales higher and create a pre-tax profit of
Y4bn.

NIPPON Oil, Japan's largest petroleum distributor, announced a 1.6 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits to Y43.3bn (Dollars 394m) for the year to March, and
blamed the yen's appreciation for the price cuts on its energy products.
Net profits dropped 6.9 per cent to Y30.6bn on sales of Y1,995.9bn, down 1.6
per cent. The company's shares, however, rose Y14 on the news to end at Y853
on the Tokyo stock exchange yesterday.
Earnings per share fell to Y25.35 from Y31.05 the year before.
Nippon Oil estimates pre-tax profits will fall by 7.6 per cent to Y40bn in
the current year, making a third consecutive annual decline. It expects
overall sales to inch up 0.2 per cent to Y2,000bn .
In response to Japan's economic environment, the company plans bond
redemptions by taking about Y100bn from its reserve funds, a move that
contributes to the lower profit forecasts.
Mitsubishi Oil, the Tokyo-based refiner and distributor, announced its
pre-tax profits rose 3.8 per cent to Y24.3bn in the year to March.
Net profits dropped 21.6 per cent to Y10.6bn, while total sales gained 6.7
per cent to Y1,111bn. The company estimates pre-tax profits will grow by 2.6
per cent to Y25bn this year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RESULTS AT Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, the
Japanese machinery makers, were buoyed last year by an increase in sales by
their shipbuilding divisions, which had been a burden for both companies
over the past decade.
Most Japanese machinery makers are reporting sharp falls in sales, but MHI's
sales expanded by 0.4 per cent to a record Y2,493bn (Dollars 22.8bn), while
pre-tax profit was 9.5 per cent lower at Y140.74bn. At KHI, sales were 2.3
per cent higher at Y952.9bn and profit rose 10.7 per cent to Y22.6bn.
Hitachi Zosen, a smaller company more reliant on shipbuilding, which
accounts for 54 per cent of its sales, reported a 41.3 per cent surge in
pre-tax profit to Y17.4bn on sales up 14.6 per cent to Y358.5bn.
Japan's heavy industrial companies have reduced the capacity of their
shipbuilding operations and diversified into new business, but strong demand
in 1990 and 1991 has left them with full order books and reduced
competition.
Orders slowed last year, but most still have a backlog. Mitsubishi's
shipbuilding and steel structures division sales rose 25.3 per cent;
machinery sales were 4.3 per cent lower, and aircraft and special vehicles
were down 10.5 per cent.
For the current year, MHI expects sales and profits to be about the same and
made no specific forecasts. However, orders for new vessels were down 18.6
per cent last year, though power system orders gained 30 per cent.
Kawasaki's ship sales were 43 per cent higher, though new orders slumped 60
per cent. Rolling stock sales were up 15.6 per cent while sales of aerospace
equipment were just 0.3 per cent higher.
Both companies fear that the yen will put their export divisions under
increased pressure in coming months, but Kawasaki still expects sales to
grow to Y980bn, while pre-tax profit is forecast to slip to Y18bn.

<TEXT>
SCA, Sweden's second-largest pulp and paper group, said the weaker krona,
cost reductions, and increased volumes helped push up profits by 72 per
cent, to SKr271m (Dollars 37.2m), in the first quarter of 1993.
Mr Sverker Martin-Lof, president, said the group's most important markets,
particularly Germany, were still weak. Prices remained under pressure for
most products, excluding lightweight coated paper.
However, the company is sticking to its earlier forecast of full-year
profits in the range of SKr1bn to SKr1.5bn.
Sales rose 8 per cent to SKr8.58bn from SKr7.98bn, reflecting beneficial
currency movements and volume growth. Operating profit eased to SKr523m from
SKr531m following last year's disposal of energy operations. This, however,
was more than offset by a drop in financial costs, from SKr373m to SKr252m.
The group said all but one of its four main business units improved
earnings. Graphic paper operations made a profit for the first time in five
quarters, posting a SKr37m operating surplus after last year's SKr74m loss.
The unit benefited from cost reductions and the stronger dollar, which
reduced exports of newsprint from North America to Europe.
The company's hygiene division, Molnlycke, had another strong quarter, with
profits rising 82 per cent to SKr311m.
The packaging division saw operating profit rise to SKr153m from SKr114m.

<TEXT>
BANK Austria, the country's largest bank, is expected to continue resisting
demands that it submit to an audit by the state auditing office
(Rechnungshof).
Yesterday, Mr Helmut Zilk, the mayor of Vienna, ordered the bank to comply
with the Rechnungshof's demand. A foundation controlled by the city has a
majority stake in the bank. The national government holds another 25 per
cent.
The Rechnungshof's auditors attempted to enter the bank earlier this month
but were blocked.
Mr Rene Alfons Haiden, chief executive, said then that Bank Austria was a
private company and therefore not subject to normal state audits.
Mr Siegfried Sellitsch, chairman of the bank's supervisory board, said
foreign shareholders, including Italy's Cariplo and Germany's
Hamburg-Mannheimer-Versicherung, were particularly upset about the prospect
of public control.
The bank's supervisory board and board of directors are to discuss the
matter on June 17. They are likely to appeal to the minister of finance and,
if that fails, to Austria's supreme court for administrative cases.
Mr Haiden has indicated that he would consider taking the case to the
European Court.

GENERAL Motors, the world's leading volume carmaker, yesterday suffered its
first important loss in the legal battle against Germany's Volkswagen.
An initial bid to prevent seven former employees of GM and Adam Opel, the US
group's German subsidiary, from working for Volkswagen for 12 months was
thrown out by a Frankfurt court.
Meanwhile, a public prosecutor examining GM's complaints of industrial
espionage against a top VW executive, said preliminary investigations could
last at least six months.
This followed a statement that enough information had already been gathered
to justify an initial probe.
The US concern had been asked to provide further documents to back its most
serious claim against VW: that its former global buying chief, Mr Jose
Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, and others had taken secret documents and
industrial information with him when he defected to VW in March.
Opel said later the case against the seven more junior VW employees would
continue. Yesterday's rejection at an oral hearing of Opel's application for
an urgent temporary injunction would be followed by a full hearing, he
added.
Timing would depend on the court's timetable.
'We had expected this verdict,' Dr Lopez said. 'We came to Volkswagen of our
own free will. Every person has the right to choose where he works.'
The decision was the first significant setback for Opel, which recently won
an injunction barring VW from continuing 'systematically' to poach its
personnel. According to Opel, Mr Lopez and his colleagues had approached
around 40 senior buying and production staff.
According to a VW official, the company had chosen not to challenge this
injunction to 'avoid further legal conflict and because the charge was not
valid either in the past or now'.
The seven involved in yesterday's case, which did not involve Mr Lopez,
include former top members of Mr Lopez's buying team at GM, who left the US
shortly after their boss. Most notable is Mr Jose Gutierrez, GM's former
machinery and equipment procurement chief, and now head of purchasing for
the VW brand division.
The delays caused by the long investigation into the charges against Mr
Lopez, and the rejection of the call for the injunction, will bring
widespread relief to VW.
They will allow its new employees to press ahead with the urgent overhaul of
the purchasing and manufacturing processes.

FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Loss at Dutch packaging group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
KNP BT, the newly-formed Dutch paper, packaging and printing equipment
group, has announced a 'modest' loss for the first quarter of 1993. It said
the downward trend continued into April and May.
The company also announced a reshuffling of its role as a sales agent for
Germany's two biggest manufacturers of printing equipment, MAN Roland and
Heidelberg. This will allow it to meet conditions laid down by the European
Commission when it approved the KNP BT merger earlier this month.
Mr Robert van Oordt, chairman, cautioned that it would not be easy for KNP
BT to post a net operating profit for 1993 as a whole. He said the company
would be taking 'substantial' extraordinary charges this year to pay for an
accelerated programme of reorganisation and integration. It would also be
pursuing cost cuts worth Fl 150m (Dollars 82m).
Another goal is to make unspecified divestments of non-core activities.
As part of a new geographic split, KNP BT is to create two legally-separate
organisations to represent Heidelberg in Europe and Mexico and MAN Roland in
eastern Asia, Australia and New Zealand. To do this, it will be divesting
four subsidiaries with combined turnover of Fl 400mto Fl 500m.

SME, the Italian state-owned foods, retailing and catering group which is to
be sold into the private sector, reports a slight increase in group net
profits after minority interests, to L127.2bn (Dollars 86.1m) last year from
L125.6bn.
Group sales reached L5,850bn against L5,814bn. However, adjusted for
disposals during the year, turnover rose by 8.2 per cent.
The sharpest growth came in food production - the first division to be sold
 -with a 11.9 per cent rise in sales to L2,104bn. Adjusted for takeovers and
disposals, the increase was 6.5 per cent.
Turnover on the catering side, concentrated in the Autogrill subsidiary,
climbed 9.7 per cent to L1,115bn, while food retailing rose 4.8 per cent to
L2,631bn.
SME's earnings rose more sharply at pre-tax level, with a leap to L230.2bn
from L142.2bn in 1991. The company said net earnings had been burdened by
much higher tax payments.
Parent company net profits jumped 27 per cent to L93.2bn from L73.5bn,
largely due to extraordinary gains on the sale of subsidiaries.

FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Swiss show unease over airline
plan for link-up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Swiss government has for the first time indicated unease about Swissair
joining an alliance with three other European airlines.
It has ordered the company to put forward alternative plans that would
guarantee its independence.
The decision throws uncertainty over plans by Swissair, Scandinavian
Airlines System (SAS), KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Austrian Airlines to
merge their operations into a joint company.
Their merger is intended to form a 'fourth force' in the European airline
industry to compete against the big three European airlines: British
Airways, Lufthansa of Germany and Air France.
A Swiss newspaper claimed the alliance would result in the suppression of
the Swissair name, the loss of 10,000 Swissair jobs, and the movement of
important decision-making to Amsterdam.
Swissair denied this, saying its name would be preserved in the medium-term,
as would Zurich as a decision centre. Moreover, the job loss figure was
'wildly exaggerated'.
Mr Casanova said Swissair's future had a 'political dimension', since the
airline was 20 per cent owned by Swiss public authorities, including the
federal government with a 7 per cent stake.
Similar opposition to the four-carrier alliance has already broken out in
Austria, where Lufthansa is understood to be discussing with Austrian
Airlines an alternative commercial partnership agreement.
If the Lufthansa talks are successful, and Austrian Airlines opts for an
alliance with the German carrier, this would represent a further blow for
the four-airline alliance.
The partners in the venture are seeking to set up a joint operating company
by the beginning of next year to respond to increasing globalisation of the
airline industry.

FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: UBS plays down takeover hopes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
UNION Bank of Switzerland, the country's largest bank, would like to expand
its investment banking presence in the US, but faces extraordinary
regulatory obstacles there.
Any important acquisition of a US company or business in investment banking
would almost certainly oblige the bank to close its substantial and
successful commercial US bank branch, Mr Ulrich Grete, UBS executive
vice-president, said.
Thus, stock market rumours in recent weeks of a takeover by UBS of Lehman
Brothers, the investment banking subsidiary of troubled American Express,
seem unfounded.
UBS never comments on rumours, but Mr Grete said the bank was not working on
any acquisition projects at the moment. He said the bank probably would not
make any large acquisition within the next two years.
The comments come in the wake of the bank's controversial resolution at last
month's annual meeting to raise authorised equity capital by about 8 per
cent for possible use in financing takeovers.
Under a new Swiss law, companies can use such reserve capital at any time
for a period of two years without seeking further shareholder approval for
rights issues or for 'important purposes' without offering shareholders the
prior right to buy the shares. At the end of the two years, it must seek a
fresh mandate from shareholders at the AGM.
UBS has been criticised in Swiss financial circles for stretching the
interpretation of the law and seeking to undermine shareholder rights. It
was generally understood that such shares would be used in lieu of cash in
cases of takeovers, but UBS has given itself the right to make market
placements as well to finance takeovers.
Mr Grete said the bank's main goal was to improve its return on equity - 7.4
per cent last year - to 10 per cent by 1995, so it would try hard to avoid
issuing new shares. However, the US was 'the one area' where the bank might
make 'an extraordinary step' to improve its position in asset management and
investment banking.
The problem was that any such acquisition could undermine its ability to
continue carrying on both investment and commercial banking in the US. At
the moment, it benefitted from 'grandfather' status, having both types of
business prior to the passage of the International Banking Act. But this
status would be in jeopardy if it made a significant acquisition.
'The probability that in two years time we will have to renew the authorised
capital without having used it is very high,' Mr Grete said.

FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Countryside cash call - Pounds 16.8m rights
to fund expansion as profits rise 28%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNTRYSIDE Properties, the residential, commercial and industrial property
company based in the south east of England, is seeking to raise Pounds 16.8m
to fund an expansion of its housebuilding activities through a 3-for-11
rights issue priced at 106p.
The cash call was accompanied by a bullish assessment of the group's
housebuilding prospects from Mr Alan Cherry, chairman, and the interim
results which showed a 28 per cent increase in pre-tax profits because of
the absence of provisions.
In his letter to shareholders Mr Cherry said, 'there are signs that the
housing market has begun to recover from the recession which started towards
the end of 1988. Against this background the directors consider that it is
now appropriate to expand the group's housebuilding activities.'
Countryside plans expansion on two fronts: speculative housebuilding for
sale to owner occupiers, and housebuilding under design and build contracts
for housing associations and other social housing agencies. Eventually the
group is aiming to build 3,000 new homes a year in the south east - up from
a projected 1,250 this year.
Funds raised through the rights issue, underwritten by Smith New Court, will
be used 'to take advantage of opportunities to purchase land which is
currently under option, at what is expected to prove to be advantageous
prices.'
Looking ahead, Mr Cherry described the group's forward sales position of in
excess of Pounds 100m compared with Pounds 55m this time last year as 'most
encouraging.' He said both inquiries and sales reservations had 'greatly
improved' and that new house prices had generally stabilised with modest
increases being obtained on some developments.
In the six months to March 31 the group achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds
2.6m compared with Pounds 2.04m. Last time profits were reduced by a Pounds
1.02m provision relating to residential development sites. Turnover slipped
to Pounds 41.9m (Pounds 42.2m).
Sales by the residential division increased to Pounds 36.7m (Pounds 36m) and
profits grew to Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 2.9m). The commercial division made a
profit of Pounds 100,000 compared with a loss of Pounds 300,000 on turnover
which fell from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 2.3m, while property investment income
was static at Pounds 2.9m and produced an unchanged loss of Pounds 600,000.
Earnings per share increased to 4.3p (3.2p) and the interim dividend is
being maintained at 1.41p.
The group's shares closed unchanged at 130p.

FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: A new line for selling insurance - The
industry's increasing use of direct sales by telephone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS THIS week that Rollins Hudig Hall, one of the world's biggest insurance
brokers, and General Accident are joining forces to launch SelectDirect, a
new telephone-based service to sell home and motor policies, has served to
signal the growth in so-called 'direct' insurance business.
The new venture is one of a number by UK insurance companies and brokers in
recent months. It responds to the inroads into the motor insurance market
made by direct writers in the last two years. Direct writers sell insurance
through a combination of telephone sales and mass media advertising,
bypassing the broker, the industry's traditional middle man.
By the end of this year nearly two million motorists will be insured by the
three biggest direct writers - Direct Line, Churchill, and The Insurance
Service.
Direct Line, launched in 1986, confidently expects to be the biggest motor
insurer in the country by the end of the year and is making handsome profits
for its parent, the Royal Bank of Scotland.
Churchill, launched by Switzerland's Winterthur, in 1989, says it is now
making profits, as is The Insurance Service, the direct writing subsidiary
of Royal Insurance.
According to a survey to be published next month by GSR, the London research
company, direct writers currently account for 20 per cent of the Pounds
6.1bn motor insurance market. GSR predicts that the market share of direct
writers will rise to 40 per cent by 1998.
The managers of direct writing companies say that recent growth of direct
sales indicates the public is increasingly prepared to buy insurance by
telephone.
Mr Richard Hill, chief executive of TIS, says direct telephone sales are
ideally suited for low margin insurance products such as motor insurance.
'You wouldn't sell cheques or credit cards by a broker. Why sell motor
insurance that way?'
SelectDirect's formation reflects an increasing recognition among brokers
about the popularity of telephone sales.
RHH, whose US parent Aon Corporation took over Frank B Hall and its UK
subsidiary Leslie &amp; Godwin last year, is following in the footsteps of three
other chains of telephone-based brokers: AA Insurance, Swinton Insurance,
which is owned by Sun Alliance, and Safeguard.
But unlike these three competitors RHH does not intend to establish a
network of high street branches, which it believes will add substantially to
its cost base.
General Accident's involvement in the new venture reflects its commitment to
telephone-based sales. Along with Eagle Star and Royal Insurance, GA is one
of the three big UK composite (multi-line) insurers to have established its
own direct writer. GA 1-2-1 now underwrites 17 per cent of General
Accident's motor insurance book.
A fourth composite, Guardian Royal Exchange is also widely expected to
follow suit within the next 12 months. GRE's subsidiary in the Irish
Republic - PMPA Insurance - is a successful direct response company. Mr
James Morley, finance director, acknowledges the trend towards direct sales
in motor insurance. 'It is more a question of when rather than whether
although we have not reached a definitive view that the time is right.'
Two other composite companies - Commercial Union and Sun Alliance - are also
thought to be increasing the proportion of direct motor business.
Legal &amp; General is also examining the possibility of a new direct insurer,
while other direct writers include Prospero, the subsidiary of Provincial
Insurance, Preferred, a subsidiary of Denmark's Topdanmark and Touchline,
which is owned by GAN, the large French company.
Underwriters at Lloyd's of London - which has a 15 per cent share of the UK
motor market - are also active in the market. Earlier this year Admiral, a
service company managed by the Hayter Brockbank agency, began a direct
operation in January from a new base in Cardiff.
Admiral aims to have between 45,000 and 70,000 policyholders by the end of
the year, but according to Mr David Stevens, marketing manager, it is is
focusing on relatively small 'niches' such as drivers who are under 25 but
have clean driving records.
By contrast, companies such as Direct Line, Churchill and The Insurance
Service are aiming to win a much wider share of the market. Direct Line
intends to attack the home insurance market. In the motor market, all are
selective about the sort of motorist they will insure. Even so, Mr Hill says
TIS is prepared to insure four out of five motorists.
Mr Martin Long, chief executive of Churchill, says the main thing is 'we
have not set out to be a niche player. We've set out to become one of the
UK's largest motor insurers very rapidly. We plan to be big.'

FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Storehouse calls off its plans to sell
loss-maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOREHOUSE, the UK retailing group whose principal interests are the BhS and
Mothercare chains, said yesterday it had abandoned plans to sell the
loss-making Blazer menswear chain because the offers had been too low.
Blazer, which incurred a Pounds 600,000 operating loss last year, was the
final 'non-core' business Storehouse was attempting to sell, following the
disposal of the Habitat and Richards chains last year and the end of its
Oppidan property joint venture in March.
Mr Graham Rider, finance director, said that while several offers to buy
Blazer had been received, they would have represented a bigger book loss
than the board was prepared to accept.
He added Blazer would still be classified 'non-core', as it did not have the
potential to be a mass-market business like BhS or Storehouse. But it was
essentially sound, and Storehouse believed it had a number of ideas that
could return it to profit.
'There are certain things we know need putting right within the business
which we did not do while it was up for sale, but we will now be looking
at,' he said.

FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind 14% rise to Pounds
10.8m at Plysu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACQUISITIONS helped to boost profits at Plysu, the plastic container
manufacturer which yesterday revealed a 14 per cent advance at the pre-tax
level to Pounds 10.8m for the year to March 31.
Mr James Summerlin, chairman, said difficult trading in industrial
containers and the arrival of competitors in the milk bottle business had
been responsible for a slight decrease in underlying profits. The return in
continuing operations before interest fell from Pounds 9.84m to Pounds
9.49m.
Group sales rose by 31 per cent to Pounds 86.4m (Pounds 66m). This was
largely due to the Pounds 18.8m contribution for 8 months from SEP, the
Benelux-based blow moulded plastics container company purchased for Pounds
13.5m last summer.
Mr Summerlin warned that although the first few months of SEP's performance
had been up to expectations, deepening recession in Europe had significantly
affected trading in the second half.
He estimated that recession had depressed SEP's sales potential by about 15
per cent in Europe. Plysu had decided to close a Belgian factory, acquired
before SEP, at a total cost of Pounds 750,000.
On a brighter note, Mr Summerlin said there were some signs of recovery in
the UK, although these were still tentative. He was particularly optimistic
about the outlook for plastic milk and juice bottles, in spite of an
increasingly competitive market.
Plysu claims some 70 per cent of this market which Mr Summerlin estimated
was worth about Pounds 35m a year 'and growing.'
The main growth in the current year was likely to come from this division. A
new factory would be opened this year and called for a large part of the
group's planned Pounds 14m (Pounds 12m) capital expenditure.
The final dividend was raised from 4.35p to 5p, for an increased total of 7p
(6p). Earnings advanced from 13.9p to 15.3p.
COMMENT
Plysu's decline from a 300p share price a year ago to last night's 248p may
be due partly to management changes last year. However, the steady fall is
more likely to reflect concerns over raw material price increases and the
company's exposure to recession-beset Europe. On the plus side, Plysu's
consistent investment in the business has left it with state of the art
manufacturing facilities and a leading position in the growing dairy market.
Forecasts have nevertheless been pulled back slightly to about Pounds 12m
pre-tax this year, taking into account tougher times in the industrial
market. The shares, on a prospective p/e of 16 times, appear to have little
room for immediate advancement.

FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Board changes as Olives Property seeks
Pounds 2.55m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OLIVES PROPERTY yesterday announced a placing and open offer to raise Pounds
2.55m after expenses.
The company, which also reported a Pounds 1.69m pre-tax loss for 1992, said
the funds would be used to reduce borrowings and provide capital for
investment.
In addition, the board plans to appoint Mr Anthony Grant, non-executive
chairman of Grant &amp; Partners, as chairman and joint chief executive and Mr
Gary Leigh of First Argyll as joint chief executive.
Mr Kent and Mr Gerald Jiggins, finance director, will remain non-executive
directors.
The shares of Mr Kent and family settlements are held through Kent Holdings,
which owns 50.54 per cent of Olives. It has agreed to sell 2.19m ordinary
Olives shares at 31p each to the new management.
Mr Grant (and trustees under his family settlement) will be investing about
Pounds 1.5m (including a limited non-recourse loan to Mr Leigh for the
purpose of his share acquisition and placing.)
Under the 4-for-3 placing of 9.76m shares at 28p each, Mr Grant and the
trustees have irrevocably undertaken to take up a total of 2.05m new
ordinary shares and Mr Leigh has undertaken to take up 878,225.
Following all transactions Mr Grant and the trustees will hold 3.59m shares,
representing 20.99 per cent of the capital and Mr Leigh will hold 1.54m
shares, or 9 per cent.
Kent Holdings has undertaken to apply for 2.01m ordinary shares under the
open offer. In addition, it has a commitment under the placing of up to
1.58m shares.
Olives' results for 1992 were hit by an exceptional item of Pounds 1.34m,
which helped turn last time's Pounds 718,600 pre-tax surplus into a Pounds
1.69m deficit.
Sales rose to Pounds 2.14m (Pounds 1.58m).
An extraordinary item of Pounds 1.38m (Pounds 327,700) represented provision
against the carrying value of investments in Continental Paper Group, the
former associate company which has gone into receivership.
Losses per share amounted to 21.55p (5.78p earnings). The final dividend has
been omitted, leaving the total at 1.5p, against 6p in 1991.
Following a review of the balance sheet, the proposed directors intend to
dispose of certain assets which Kent Holdings has agreed to acquire. It is
also intended to move the head office from Bristol to London.
An extraordinary meeting will be held on June 18 to seek approval for the
above proposals.

FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Reorganisation at London Electricity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON ELECTRICITY yesterday announced its biggest reorganisation since it
came to the market two and half years ago.
The regional electricity company has established three divisions to refocus
its business in the run-up to 1994, when the market will be open to greater
competit - ion.
Network services is taking over the regulated distribution activities,
including the restructured electrical contracting business and the operation
of the airport distribution systems acquired from BAA earlier this year.
Customer services will be responsible for the regulated supply of
electricity.
Energy services will concentrate on the competitive market of bulk
electricity trading, including pooling and settlement operations.
The group's other competitive interests, such as electricity marketing to
customers with demands greater than 100kw and gas marketing through its
joint venture with Total Gas, will also be part of the energy division.
Mr Roger Urwin, chief executive, said: 'This is the next logical move since
we were floated. The reorganisation reflects the change in our business.'
The company has withdrawn from retail operations and restructured its
contracting operations, leading to the loss of 350 jobs.
Mr Mike Brown, responsible for customer services, and Mr Ian Beament, who is
to take charge of network services, will join the board next month.

FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Ex-Savoy manager likely for Forte hotels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORTE group is thought to be close to announcing that it has appointed
Mr Willi Bauer, former general manager of the Savoy Hotel, to run its luxury
hotels.
The expected appointment of Mr Bauer comes after Mr Rocco Forte, Forte
chairman, reaffirmed to shareholders this week that he would like to merge
Forte's Exclusive Portfolio of hotels with those of the Savoy group.
The Forte Exclusive hotels are a group of 20 luxury establishments,
including the Grosvenor House and Hyde Park Hotel in London, the Westbury
and Plaza Athenee in New York, the Ritz in Madrid and the George V in Paris.
The appointment of Mr Bauer would represent a remarkable reconciliation with
Mr Forte following acrimonious clashes between the two men during Forte's
attempt to take over the Savoy group during the 1980s. Mr Bauer had run the
Grosvenor House before leaving to become general manager of the Savoy in
1982. He ran the Savoy until 1989.
In 1988, Mr Forte said that Mr Bauer would be sacked if Forte succeeded in
acquiring the Savoy. He said it was ridiculous that Mr Bauer should have
been paid Pounds 180,000 the previous year. He said that he would have
earned a maximum of Pounds 60,000 if he had still been employed by Forte.
The takeover battle ended with Forte holding a majority of Savoy shares, but
a minority of voting shares. The two sides declared a five-year truce which
ends in November next year. Neither Forte nor Mr Bauer would comment last
night.

FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Prime People sells Bowford for Pounds 1.06m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIME PEOPLE, the Manch ester-based specialist training group, yesterday
announced that it was selling Bowford Engineering Services only six months
after reversing into the company in a Pounds 2.8m deal.
At the same time, USM-quoted Prime People announced pre-tax losses of Pounds
392,255 for the 10 months to October 31, against Pounds 575,518 for the
whole of 1991. Mr Peter Hearn, who became chairman in January when Mr Alan
Greenough resigned, said the result was 'disappointing'. Turnover was Pounds
765,840 (Pounds 918,394 for year).
In January, the company warned that Bowford's turnover had failed to improve
from its level at the time of the acquisition. In the event, Bowford
incurred losses of Pounds 170,361 for the six months ended April 30, 1993.
Bowford has been sold to BA Holdings, a company formed by the trustees of
the family settlements of Mr John Ashford, a Prime People director, and Mr
Geoff Bowers and their respective wives. Mr Ashford and Mr Bowers founded
Bowford, which provides technically-based training services, in 1981.
Consideration for Bowford will be Pounds 1.06m. In addition, an intercompany
balance due to Bowford from Prime People of Pounds 637,250 will be waived
and 31m ordinary shares issued to the vendors of Bowford (other than Mr
Bowers) will be converted into 31m deferred ordinary which will have
essentially no rights.
Mr Ashford plans to resign as a Prime People director and will not receive
any compensation for loss of office.
The sale is subject to approval at an EGM to be held on June 18.

FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Swiss eyes on UK engineers / A look at the
fund-raising proposals of Emesco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Industrial Equity Company, the Luxembourg investment arm of Emesco,
the Swiss management services group, is completing a SFr50m (Pounds 22m)
fund-raising in London and other European centres.
The move will lead to takeovers of medium-sized UK engineering companies
over the next year. Half of the fund-raising is via a rights issue which has
already been taken up. Apart from Emesco, which in addition to managing EIEC
holds 30 per cent of the equity, shareholders include insurance groups like
Equitable Life and National Provident.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities, handling the fund-raising in London,
expects to complete the other half, a share placing, by the end of this
month. EIEC units, comprising one ordinary share and one redeemable
preference share, each with a par value of SFr100, are being sold at SFr228
each.
Under present plans the units, currently quoted in Luxembourg, will be
quoted in London or Zurich by 1998.
Emesco, which has set up a London office, is seeking to invest EIEC funds in
engineering companies with a turnover of between Pounds 10m and Pounds 50m.
Its previous investments in continental Europe have been in the unquoted
sector, often 'family businesses going through a change of generation,' said
Mr Richard Butler, chairman of EIEC and an Emesco director. But in the UK,
he added, 'I think we will be dealing with listed companies.' Its search for
investment is largely outside London.
Emesco's technique is to identify companies which need restructuring and are
usually loss-making, buy them through EIEC, put in place its own executives
as a management team and once the company is making profits either to float
it or sell it to a third party. It aims to complete the process within five
years.
'We look at the product rather than the financials. What does the company
make? Is it in a special market where there are opportunities? If we're
excited about the product, then we go ahead,' said Mr Butler.
'Emesco is not a rescue merchant, called in by the banks at the last moment.
We're more interested in companies which have lost their way, but which have
good products and need restructuring,' he said.
Emesco then is different both from a management consultant, providing an
existing management with solutions to specific problems, and a venture
capitalist, providing equity funds but no management.
EIEC started in 1986 and reorganised its share capital in 1991. Its
portfolio of companies, bought in 1991-92, comprises Atlantic Zeiser, a
numbering machine company in Germany; Caracte(grave)res Werding, a Swiss
company which once made metallic characters for typewriters but now
manufactures aerosol spray systems; Convac, based in Germany and
manufacturing equipment for the computer industry; and Etheco, an Italian
company making thermostats.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses at Celltech, the biotechnology group, were trimmed from Pounds 4.52m
to Pounds 4.28m pre-tax for the six months ended March 31. Turnover of
Pounds 5.5m compared with Pounds 5.35m.
The result reflected a 'good performance' from Celltech Biologics and
receipt of Pounds 2.05m (nil) milestone payments, a further tranche in the
Pounds 26m agreement with Bayer, the German pharmaceutical group.
These items offset a 26 per cent increase in research and development
investment to Pounds 6.91m and a decline in net interest income to Pounds
558,000 (Pounds 1.06m).
Celltech is continuing with its plans to float in the 1993-94 year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hoskins Brewery is in talks which might lead to a substantial acquisition.
Part of the consideration would be met by the issue of new shares.
Hoskins said the acquisition would be coupled with a pre-conditional cash
offer for all of the company's issued share capital at 55p per share.
The making of the offer would be conditional on the notice to convene an EGM
to approve the acquisition being posted to shareholders.
Hoskins anticipated that certain shareholders would not accept such an
offer, if made, and said that any Hoskins ordinary shares in respect of
which acceptances of the offer may be received, would be placed with
institutions and others at 55p per share.

FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Cambridge expects 'significant'
losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cambridge Group, the Dublin-based asset financing and confirming company,
said yesterday that it expected to report 'significant losses' for the year
to February 28 1993.
The losses put Cambridge in breach of its banking covenants and the banks
have been asked for a temporary waiver of these breaches, pending a review
of its business and renegotiation of banking facilities.
The company said the losses were due mainly to provisions in the confirming
division, because of the impact on customers in the second half of high
interest rates and exchange rate volatility.
The division's business was under review and the group annual results would
be delayed pending publication of the review.
No final dividend would be proposed.
In the six months to August 31 Cambridge saw pre-tax profits fall 43 per
cent to IPounds 1.43m.
During the period, debt facilities were increased by IPounds 9m to IPounds
74.5m.

SHARES OF Perpetual, the unit trust and portfolio management organisation,
rose 52p to 453p yesterday on news of a surge in profits from Pounds 2.18m
to Pounds 5.09m pre-tax for the six months to end-March.
Turnover of Pounds 325.83m compared with Pounds 121.33m previously and basic
earnings per share worked through at 13.28p (6.14p), or 12.05p fully
diluted. Because of changes in the Budget payment of the 1.8p (1.2p) interim
dividend was brought forward to April.
Mr Martyn Arbib, chairman, believed that a further improvement in profits
could be achieved in the second half and said it should be possible to
declare a 'substantial increase' in the final dividend - last year's final
was 3.6p.
He pointed out that funds under management increased over the opening six
months from Pounds 846m to Pounds 1.34bn boosted by an influx of some Pounds
260m of net new money. The funds have subsequently increased to about Pounds
1.5bn.
Turnover and pre-tax profits for the year to September 30 1992 totalled
Pounds 246.64m and Pounds 4.79m.

<TEXT>
DCC, the Dublin-based private industrial holding company, improved pre-tax
profits by 2 per cent to IPounds 13.8m (Pounds 13.4m) for the year ending
March 31.
At the same time the company confirmed that it would seek a stock market
listing 'in the medium term'.
DCC is one of the few private Irish companies to publish full financial
statements.
The company has been built up over 16 years from a IPounds 1m venture
capital operation into a holding company with net assets now totalling
IPounds 136m, including a net cash bal-ance of IPounds 21m, by Mr Jim
Flavin, its founder and chief executive.
DCC took a majority stake in Printech and Wardell Roberts at the end of last
year, increased its holding in Fyffes to 11 per cent, and more recently
announced its intention to take a 29.9 per cent stake in Kingston Oil, the
UK recycler of waste oils.
It has invested IPounds 22m in building these and other stakes over the past
year.
Earnings per share for the year totalled 77.8p (76.5) and a dividend
increase to 11.5p (10p) is proposed.
DCC is 95 per cent-owned by institutional investors, the two largest being
the Bank of Ireland and Irish Life.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Colour, which makes pigments for printing inks, lifted pre-tax
profits from Pounds 47,000 to Pounds 640,000 in the year ended March 31.
A 22 per cent surge in European mainland sales helped group turnover rise by
over 5 per cent to Pounds 14.01m (Pounds 13.27m). The final dividend is
0.525p (0.4p) making 0.8p (0.65p) for the year.
Earnings per share rose to 1.35p (0.33p).
European sales showed similar growth in 1991-92 and now account for 27 per
cent of turnover.
This follows development of new high quality products offering brighter
colours, and attainment of the ISO 9001 European quality standard.
The company made small net gains from Britain's exit from the ERM after
price adjustments to imports and exports, but these went towards eliminating
a Deutschemark overdraft it was maintaining as a hedge.
Mr Mike Armitage, managing director, said the company was constrained by its
small size, but was a successful niche player, selling to inkmakers. He said
the company would grow organically.
He would not rule out acquisitions if the fits were right. 'But don't hold
your breath,' he added.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE, the UK aero-engine and industrial power group, warned yesterday
that trading conditions would remain under pressure over the next two years,
writes Paul Betts.
He saw little prospect of an improvement in market conditions until 1995,
but Sir Ralph Robins, chairman, told the annual general meeting that the
group was 'determined not to be swept off course.'
The high level of investment in research and development necessary for
long-term growth strategies would continue.
Describing market conditions as 'very difficult', Sir Ralph said that the
group's current level of profitability was 'quite unsatisfactory.'
Rolls-Royce reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 184m last year, reflecting
restructuring provisions of Pounds 268m.
The company has also announced plans to reduce its workforce by a further
5,000 people over the next two years.
But Sir Ralph said he believed the company's strategies would strengthen its
position in world markets when the recovery eventually occured.

FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: BP agrees division sale to managers for
Pounds 250m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH PETROLEUM agreed yesterday to sell its consumer products division to
a management buy-out for Pounds 250m. Sir Allen Sheppard will become
non-executive chairman of the new company with Mr Michael Handley,
previously divisional managing director of RHM, to become managing director.
The consumer products division is a leading supplier of household
detergents, cleaners and personal care products to supermarkets. It
comprises Robert McBride in the UK, Yplon in Belgium and Solaro in Italy
with a workforce of 4,000 and a turnover last year of Pounds 350m.
Financial backing for the buy-out was put together by Legal and General, the
insurance company, which is understood to have beaten several other
management groups in the bidding process.
The consumer products division is the second of BP Nutrition's businesses to
be sold since the sector was put up for sale about a year ago.
Consumer Foods was sold to Sara Lee, the US group, last December. Purina,
animal foods in the US and other animal feeds businesses in Europe are still
for sale.
The consumer products business is understood to have enjoyed solid profits
in the past couple of years although BP will not disclose figures.

FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Flextech in Family Channel venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLEXTECH, the oil services company that transferred itself into a cable and
satellite television operation, yesterday announced a joint venture to
launch The Family Channel in the UK.
International Family Entertainment, which owns The Family Channel available
in more than 60 per cent of US homes, paid more than Dollars 90m (Pounds
58m) for TVS Entertainment, the south of England ITV company that lost its
franchise.
Flextech, the USM-quoted company which controls The Children's Channel, has
now agreed to take a 39 per cent stake in The Family Channel (UK).
The two groups will share a satellite channel with the children's programmes
during the day followed by the Family Channel in the evening.
Mr Roger Luard, of Flextech, said yesterday: 'This is a very exciting
development.'
The package of family entertainment will be launched in September as part of
the new subscription scheme being launched by British Sky Broadcasting in
the autumn.
At least 10 channels will be launched as a new subscription package priced
initially at around Pounds 3.99 a month.
Mr Tim Robertson, president of IFE, said yesterday that he saw the joint
venture with Flextech as a way into other international markets including
Asia. From the beginning The Family Channel plans to make original
programmes such as quizzes at its UK headquarters - the old TVS studios at
Maidstone.
Meanwhile, Flextech yesterday returned pre tax losses of Pounds 1.57m for
the period February 18 to December 31 1992.
Because of the sale of its oil services activities it said no meaningful
comparatives were possible.
A dividend of 0.5p is recommended. Future dividends will be determined in
the light of trading results and prospects.
The Children's Channel saw revenues increase in the final quarter of 1992 by
37 per cent.
The channel has recently signed a contract with BSkyB (in which Pearson,
owners of the Financial Times, has a significant stake) which 'will have a
positive impact on the future revenue prospects of TCC', the group said.
Furthermore, Flextech said yesterday that TCC had entered into a joint
venture with Quantum International, a subsidiary of National Media
Corporation of the US, to broadcast a home shopping 'informercial' service
on its surplus hours on Astra 1A.
The board believes the joint venture will benefit from the forecast increase
in cable subscribers and dish owners throughout Europe.

FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Courtaulds climbs to Pounds 193m - Sterling
devaluation and exceptionals behind 4% improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEVALUATION of sterling helped Courtaulds, the chemical materials group,
reveal pre-tax profits up 4 per cent from Pounds 186m to Pounds 193m for the
year to March 31.
The results were on turnover up 7 per cent from Pounds 1.94bn to Pounds
2.07bn. Operating profits moved to Pounds 208m (Pounds 206m).
However, at constant exchange rates, turnover, operating and pre-tax profits
would have been lower by Pounds 121m, Pounds 12m and Pounds 6m respectively.
The results were also helped by exceptional items producing a Pounds 1.7m
profit, compared with a Pounds 15.1m loss previously.
Net debt fell by Pounds 11m to Pounds 222m, mainly due to a Pounds 49m cash
repayment from the UK pension scheme. The results were compiled according to
the new FRS 3 accounting standard.
'We have held our own in sales and profits and maintained a strong balance
sheet while not stinting on investment,' said Mr Michael Pragnell, finance
director.
Performance materials recovered from a poor first half to generate most of
the group's growth in operating profits. The light armoured vehicle project
helped the division post a 50 per cent increase from Pounds 12m to Pounds
18m on turnover of Pounds 214m (Pounds 183m).
Coatings' profits fell from Pounds 59m to Pounds 58m, despite a strong
performance in the Far East, on sales of Pounds 729m (Pounds 675m).
The packaging division increased operating profits from Pounds 25m to Pounds
27m, on turnover of Pounds 260m (Pounds 244m). Sales of tubes grew by more
than 20 per cent, but the European operations had a difficult year.
Chemicals' profits fell by Pounds 1m to Pounds 41m, on sales down 7 per cent
from Pounds 233m to Pounds 216m. Demand for acetate products weakened, but
cost-cutting and sterling's devaluation helped the business, said Mr Sipko
Huismans, chief executive.
Fibres and films posted reduced trading profits of Pounds 71m (Pounds 73m)
on increased turnover of Pounds 667m (Pounds 582m), mostly due to the
acetate film joint-venture. Mr Huismans said the US market was proving
difficult.
The new Tencel factory was operating at 80 per cent capacity and the board
would consider commissioning a second line later this year, said Mr
Huismans.
Operating profits in the Asia-Pacific market, which includes Australasia,
increased 12 per cent to 28m (Pounds 25m) on sales of Pounds 230m (Pounds
205m). Asian profits alone increased 30 per cent on sales up 15 per cent.
European input fell to Pounds 114m (Pounds 115m) on sales up 4 per cent at
Pounds 1.27bn (Pounds 1.22bn). Static North American profits of Pounds 57m
were reported on turnover up 14 per cent at Pounds 588m.
Earnings per share increased by 2.6p to 37.6p. The recommended final
dividend of 10.2p makes a total of 14p (13p), up 8 per cent.

FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Mixed response to North West Water scrip
option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENHANCED scrip dividends, briefly April's corporate finance flavour of the
month for UK companies, burst back on the scene yesterday to mixed reviews
from shareholders.
'As a one-off, we don't mind it,' said one shareholder. Investors said North
West Water's finances appeared sufficiently healthy to avoid the view that
it had resorted to paying dividends in shares because cash was not
available.
'But there is a danger in the constant issue of new equity. We don't want a
series of disguised rights issues.' And, shareholders said, the structure of
the latest deal looked suspiciously like a capital raising exercise.
North West, one of the 10 privatised water companies, announced a cash final
dividend of 14.27p and offered investors an alternative in shares worth an
additional 50 per cent more at 21.405p. The point of the exercise, said the
company and its advisers, Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC), is to cut the bill
for Advance Corporation Tax.
The point concentrating the minds of investors is the company's calculation
of its tax savings relative to its total savings, assuming that 90 per cent
of shareholders choose shares rather than cash. North West says it will save
Pounds 60m, of which Pounds 13.3m is ACT savings. The remainder of the
savings are simply cash payments the company will not have to make, a move
which will effectively give it access to new capital.
North West yesterday tried to soothe its shareholders' anxieties, saying:
'There is no present intention to extend this to future dividends.' However,
RTZ, which was the first company to issue enhanced scrip dividends, said on
Tuesday that it would offer the option for its interim dividend as well, an
ominous note from shareholders' point of view.
'If companies want cash, they should simply conduct a rights offering,' said
one shareholder. In a rights, companies would be expected to spell out in
detail how they intended to use the cash and what return they expected to
earn on the new capital.
Yesterday, North West said it intended to use the funds for international
expansion, development of non-core activities and expanded research and
development.
Shareholders said that the plans went further than those outlined by the
company when it first contacted them informally to ask how an enhanced scrip
issue might be received. 'We told them we wanted to know more details,' one
investor said.
The deal, like the half dozen or so for other UK companies, works like this;
companies incur ACT on profits they earn which are passed along in the form
of dividends to shareholders. However, they may offset that by the amount of
corporation tax they owe, effectively eliminating the tax charge on their
dividend payments. There is no ACT payable on dividends issued in shares
rather than cash.
But some companies pay little UK corporation tax anyway, and thus do incur
additional tax when they pay cash dividends. Barclays de Zoete Wedd, in
April, led the first deal designed to get around that problem.
Up until today, the companies issuing scrip dividends have been those with
large earnings from abroad on which no UK corporation tax is incurred.
In the case of North West, its extensive capital expenditure programme has
given rise to such large tax write-offs that its corporation tax charge is
insignificant. SBC said that at least six other water companies are in a
similar situation, although it declined to say whether issues for those are
imminent.
'We are being selectively approached and we are selectively approaching
other companies,' maintained Mr Roger Luskam, SBC executive director.
Meanwhile, the Treasury, which stands to lose hundreds of millions of pounds
in tax revenues from the various enhanced scrip dividends announced so far,
said it was 'watching' the situation, although it has no plans to alter the
tax laws.
Chancellor Norman Lamont, in the March 16 Budget, announced a review of ACT
with respect to charges incurred on dividends paid out of overseas profits.

<TEXT>
Investors seeking a stake in RPC, the rigid plastic packaging company, have
subscribed for more than 11 times the number of shares on offer.
When the offer closed on Tuesday, the intermediaries offer was 11.06 times
subscribed. That means Pounds 128m of cash was chasing Pounds 11.6m of
shares, one of the highest levels of oversubscription in recent
intermediaries offers.
On May 18 Cazenove placed 18.2m shares with institutions, representing 65
per cent of the issue. The total issue was therefore 4.3 times subscribed.

FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Ex-Guinness chief's payment defended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR DAVID Plastow, chairman of the non-executive committee of Guinness,
mounted a spirited defence yesterday of the controversial pay and pension
arrangements made for Sir Anthony Tennant, former chairman of the UK drinks
group.
The Guinness accounts, published earlier this month, revealed that in his
last year Sir Anthony received a 24 per cent rise taking his salary to
Pounds 777,000, a Pounds 204,000 annual top-up payment to take his pension
to about Pounds 500,000, and a Pounds 50,000 consultancy fee, to be paid for
two years.
Yesterday Sir David, whose committee of non-executive directors sets
executive pay levels at Guinness, told shareholders at the annual meeting
that there had been 'a number of inaccurate comments' on the subject of
executive remuneration, and 'misunderstandings' on the issue.
However, when asked by one shareholder to reveal Sir Anthony's total pension
package he said the detailed arrangements were a private matter.
'Is Pounds 500,000 correct?' pressed the shareholder. 'I am not prepared to
be specific,' said Sir David, but he acknowledged that 'the order of
magnitude is about right.' He stressed that Sir Anthony's pension reflected
'his full 40-year working career,' not just his 5-year period at Guinness,
and that the agreement to provide a two-thirds pension was in his service
contract, which had been 'available for inspection.'
Sir David said the increase in Sir Anthony's final salary was made when the
Guinness share price was at an all-time high and immediately after the
company announced record operating profits.
'His earnings were very much in line with top executive remuneration in this
country,' said Sir David, who added that the average paid to the chairmen of
the top 10 companies in the UK was 'comfortably more than Sir Anthony's
remuneration for the final year.'
The consultancy fee after his retirement was justified by Sir Anthony's
'wide experience and many contacts.'
One shareholder, who identified himself as 'poor and ordinary,' was
concerned because Sir Anthony had become a director of two other companies
after leaving Guinness. Sir David replied that what Sir Anthony did after he
left the company was a matter for him, rather than Guinness.
Most of the other questions at the packed Guinness meeting related to the
absence of shareholder perks and why the company was serving afternoon tea
instead of something a little stronger.
They seemed pacified, however, to leave with a can of Guinness and a fifth
of a litre of Johnnie Walker Black Label Scotch in a black velvet pouch -

FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Capital Radio turns in Pounds 4.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VOTE of confidence from London's popular music lovers could not stop
accountants forcing pre-tax profits at Capital Radio, the London commercial
music station, down from Pounds 6.29m to Pounds 4.65m in the six months to
March 31.
The comparative figure was distorted by the inclusion of a Pounds 2.18m gain
on a disposal taken to comply with the new FRS 3 accounting standard, which
disguised an underlying improvement of 13 per cent.
Mr Ian Irvine, chairman, stressed that adult Londoners preferred Capital FM
to Classic FM, BBC Radios 4 and 1. It continued as market leader with 32 per
cent of the adult listeners tuning in each week.
However, he said that 'while we are enthusiastic about the prospects in the
medium to long term, we continue to take a cautious view of the immediate
future.'
The company said that almost flat turnover of Pounds 16.1m (Pounds 16.2m),
which included agency commissions, disguised an improvement in Capital
Radio's sales to Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 14.2m). National advertising revenue
was static but there was a 'considerable increase' in local advertising
revenue.
Turnover at Capital Group Studios fell to Pounds 1m (Pounds 1.2m) and the
company broke even, compared with a profit of Pounds 200,000.
Operating costs fell to Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 11.1m) including the benefit of
a February decision by the Copyright Tribunal which reduced Capital Radio's
effective royalty payments to Phonographic Performance Limited, the
representative of record companies, from 6.5 per cent to 5 per cent of
turnover.
Interest receivable fell to Pounds 795,000 (Pounds 810,000).
An accelerated unchanged interim dividend of 1.75p was paid on April 5.
Earnings declined to 4.6p (6.3p).

FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Casket advances to Pounds 2.85m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CASKET, which is to make bicycles similar to the high-tech Lotus on which
Chris Boardman won an Olympic medal last summer, clocked up pre-tax profits
of Pounds 2.85m in the year to March 31 on the back of a big jump in cycle
sales.
This was a sharp rise from Pounds 341,000, but the comparison was flattered
under FRS 3 accounting rules by Pounds 1.72m in provisions made in the
previous year for operations.
Mr Joe Smith, chief executive, said: 'We must remain cautious while the
recovery is still patchy, but we are optimistic about the outlook for
Casket.'
The Boardman-inspired bike, using licenced elements of the Lotus design and
retailing for about Pounds 3,000, has yet to enter production, but Casket
has already launched five conventional models under its new LotusSport
brand. The brand is Casket's in perpetuity, subject to minimum sales of 'a
few thousand cycles' a year, the company said .
Casket now has nine brands, including famous names such as Falcon and
British Eagle, and about 250 models. UK production accounts for a third of
the total and is expected to climb to half this year.
Casket claims 25 per cent of the UK cycle market and is not looking for
'further dramatic increases,' aiming to increase sales in continental
Europe. Cycle exports are now 10 per cent.
Turnover in the year under review rose to Pounds 96.5m (Pounds 71.9m). Sales
of cycles rose by 70 per cent to Pounds 52.2m (Pounds 30.7m) some 600,000
(420,000) cycles, which gave operating profits of Pounds 3.99m (Pounds
2.25m).
The clothing division, reorganised after the acquisition of Yates in
September, lifted sales 12 per cent to Pounds 44.3m (Pounds 39.5m), giving
operating profits of Pounds 806,000 (Pounds 1.23m).
Casket sells most of its largely overseas-sourced clothes under the 'own
labels' of high-street retailers and reported margin pressure as buyers
tried to hold prices in spite of sterling's devaluation.
Net interest payments fell to Pounds 1.48m (Pounds 1.75m). Borrowings were
reduced to Pounds 4.17m (Pounds 5.6m) and gearing fell to 31 per cent (46
per cent). Net cash of Pounds 1.43m was generated.
The recommended final dividend of 0.5p (0.35p) gives a total of 0.8p (0.5p).
Earnings per share were 2.53p (0.12p).

FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Whessoe slips back to Pounds 4.02m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH FRS 3 accounting standards boosting last year's pre-tax line, Whessoe,
the instrumentation and control and piping systems group, reported a slip in
taxable profits from Pounds 4.16m to Pounds 4.02m in the half-year to March
31.
Naturally though, Mr John Samuel, group financial director, was keen to
emphasise that, at the operating level, profits grew 15 per cent to Pounds
3.74m (Pounds 3.25m), a result with which he was 'pleased', given the
'difficult trading environment.'
Group turnover advanced 11 per cent to Pounds 40.8m (Pounds 36.6m). Earnings
per share declined to 11.6p (13.7p), though without FRS 3, they would have
increased, the company said. As a result, the interim dividend is lifted to
2.3p (2.2p).
In February, Whessoe launched a Pounds 21.8m bid for Autronica, the
Norwegian maritime and industrial instrumentation and fire security systems
group.
Mr Samuel thought it 'highly unlikely' that the bid would be turned down by
the Norwegian authorities, but could not guess at the conditions that might
be imposed.
A rights issue in February raised Pounds 14.3m towards the cost of the bid,
with the balance coming from cash reserves.
The instrumentation and control division lifted profits to Pounds 1.76m
(Pounds 1.13m) on turnover of Pounds 15.7m (Pounds 10.5m), helped by a full
contribution from Varec, acquired in 1992. Profits in the piping systems
side, however, fell to Pounds 2.06m (Pounds 2.3m) on turnover down at Pounds
16.9m (Pounds 19.4m).

FT  27 MAY 93 / Daimler-Benz sales decline by 20% in first four months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STUTTGART
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SALES at Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial company, fell by nearly
20 per cent in the first four months of the year to DM26bn (Pounds 10.3bn)
the group's chief executive told shareholders at yesterday's annual general
meeting.
Earlier this month Daimler reported first-quarter net profits of just DM20m,
down from DM480m in the same period last year. For the first three months
sales were down 19 per cent to DM18.4bn.
Yesterday's figure shows that business conditions for the group have
deteriorated further during May but Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman, voiced a
degree of confidence about the outcome for the full year.
Without repeating the forecast that net profits would reach DM1bn - after
DM1.45bn last year - Mr Reuter said the group would strive to maintain a
dividend payout of DM13 for 1993 as well as 1992, even if it meant dipping
into reserves in order to be able to do so.
The main source of the downturn in sales in the first third of the year were
developments at the the Mercedes-Benz luxury car subsidiary.
But although sales in the group's most important subsidiary fell 24 per cent
in the first three months, Mr Reuter predicted that for the year as whole
they would be at around the same level as 1992 when they reached DM66.5bn.
The impetus to sales was likely to come from the introduction of the C-class
Mercedes scheduled for June this year.
Commenting on the circumstances leading up to Daimler's decision to abandon
Mercedes Holding (MAH), the holding company set up in 1975 to prevent the
Shah of Iran from taking a large stake in the group, Mr Reuter acknowledged
that Daimler had been rushed into making an announcement of its plans on
April 2. The plan had been to break the news at the annual meeting. He said
disbanding the holding structure would show Daimler no longer 'needs a
shield against hostile takeover'.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, who resigned as head of the powerful IG Metall union
on Tuesday this week after the disclosure of his dealings in MAH shares
ahead of the announcement, came in for heavy criticism at the meeting.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Queens Moat may be relisted in the autumn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in Queens Moat Houses, the suspended hotel group, may have to
wait until the autumn before the company is relisted.
The relisting depends on a refinancing, expected to be formalised in
September. It will also require asset disposals to reduce the company's
mounting debts, and a new set of accounts. 'It's a pretty standard
refinancing, but it's still big and complex,' a banker said.
Queens Moat's 64 creditor banks, which are led by Barclays and owed about
Pounds 1bn, are due to meet today and will be asked to agree to a further
three-month standstill on interest and principal repayments.
They will discuss a report compiled by Grant Thornton, the accountants,
which is expected to conclude that Queens Moat has positive net assets and a
viable future.
Mr Andrew Coppel, the former finance director of Ratners appointed as a
consultant to Queens Moat in April, is expected to be confirmed as chief
executive. Morgan Grenfell, which worked with Mr Coppel at Ratners and Sale
Tilney, has replaced Charterhouse as Queens Moat's financial adviser.
The company announced yesterday that Mr Martin Marcus and Mr David Hersey,
formerly deputy chairman and finance director respectively, have resigned
from the company.
The two men were suspended once Queens Moat's problems became apparent at
the beginning of April. The two men were closely linked with the company's
controversial management incentive scheme, believed to be partly responsible
for its financial troubles. According to one analyst, they were also 'more
expendable' than Mr John Bairstow, the founder and chairman.
A banker said it was 'no surprise' the two had left, and that their
departure had been held up pending a decision on compensation.
New accountants, believed to be Coopers &amp; Lybrand, are to replace Bird
Luckin, which has been criticised for allowing lax accounting treatment of
Queens Moat's depreciation and incentive schemes. Queens Moat's results for
1992 should be published by October.
The expected delay for the refinancing and relisting has added to worries
among shareholders and some creditors. Queens Moat's rivals have mounted
aggressive advertising campaigns to capture market share, industry sources
said.

FT  27 MAY 93 / AT&amp;T challenges Europe and steals a march on BT: Worldsource
launch targets multinationals' needs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RACE is on to become 'global outsourcer' for the telecommunications
needs of the world's multinationals, write Andrew Adonis and Martin Dickson.
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's launch this week of 'Worldsource', a set of
customised international business telecoms services, marks a determined bid
for this pitch by the largest US carrier. British Telecom, the privatised UK
operator, has similar ambitions, and as liberalisation forces the other
large European telecoms carriers to look outwards, they too could enter the
field.
The goal is simple: to become the 'one-stop shop' for the 2,500-odd large
companies with globally dispersed operations - managing and integrating
their international networks, offering them the latest in data and voice
facilities, and providing a single point of contact however dispersed the
company's outlets.
Worldsource aims to do virtually that by creating a web of partnerships with
other operators. This week it announced a link-up with Kokusai Denshin Denwa
of Japan and Singapore Telecom, and indicated that Unitel of Canada, Telstra
of Australia and Korea Telecom intend to join soon. It plans to take
Worldsource into Europe next year.
With analysts predicting that turnover in international telecoms traffic
will more than double by the year 2000, the financial stakes are immense. It
is significant that AT&amp;T launched Worldsource in the Asia-Pacific: the
region has the world's fastest growing telecoms sector.
Essentially, Worldsource enhances the existing Global Software Defined
Network service, by adding features like single billing, full integration of
international data and voice networks, and improved dialling, circuit
availability and network management standards. Says one City telecoms
analyst: 'It's innovative - but international telecoms is increasingly a
commodity business based on price, and of itself Worldsource does little to
make it cheaper.'
Extending the service to Europe is critical to Worldsource. AT&amp;T is
budgeting to spend Dollars 350m (Pounds 230m) over the next five years
providing facilities and upgrading equipment in Europe. Mr John Foster,
director of AT&amp;T's communications services in Europe, said he was keen to
talk to 'almost any' of Europe's telecoms operators about a link-up.
Since Worldsource does not give AT&amp;T exclusive rights over its partners,
most of Europe's state telecoms operators appear to have little to lose from
participation. Unless, that is, they want to be global outsourcers
themselves, and are anxious to give no succour to AT&amp;T.
BT, however, has already signalled its determination to go-it-alone. Nearly
two years ago BT launched its global outsourcing venture Syncordia, which
now boasts nine customers and an annual revenue of about Dollars 200m
(Pounds 130m). Furthermore BT and AT&amp;T are currently locked in a battle with
US and UK regulatory authorities over access to each other's public fixed
network.
So AT&amp;T could have difficulties in the UK. But it is not restricted to BT:
Mercury is a potential partner, while newly-licensed public telecom
operators Ionica National Grid's Energis are building their own networks.
As for BT, Worldsource could encourage the UK operator to link up with MCI.
There have been rumours for months that this might happen, but the drawback
from BT's point of view is that it would put itself squarely in AT&amp;T's
sights, since MCI is AT&amp;T's most important rival in the US.
AT&amp;T, moreover, has shown itself ruthless in hitting back at global
competition from MCI. MCI's only big alliance so far, announced last year,
was with Stentor, a Canadian long-distance consortium, under which MCI
technology is being used to create a fully integrated international network
between Canada and the US. AT&amp;T immediately retaliated by taking a minority
stake in Unitel, Stentor's upstart Canadian rival, and sued MCI for patent
infringement.
Just how strong demand will be for Worldsource is not clear. At the launch,
AT&amp;T put together an impressive group of companies who said they needed the
service. If the likes of Unisys, Honeywell, Motorola and United Parcel
Service meant it, the world could truly be AT&amp;T's oyster.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Courtaulds and Hoechst to merge viscose operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOECHST, the German chemicals giant, and Courtaulds, the UK group, yesterday
announced they had reached an agreement to merge their European viscose and
acrylic fibres operations.
The joint venture, to be majority owned by Courtaulds, would have had a
turnover last year of Pounds 369m, of which the UK company's share would
have been Pounds 238m.
Mr Sipko Huismans, chief executive declined to say what proportion will be
owned by the British company, but said it was substantially more than 50 per
cent, and that in effect the deal was a takeover. The business would be
consolidated in Courtaulds' accounts, he added.
The merger is subject to the agreement of competition authorities. The joint
venture would be Europe's largest manufacturer of viscose, which is used for
cotton substitutes and disposable bedding. The operations would have a
capacity of about 135,000 tonnes a year, larger than those of Lanzing of
Austria, which has capacity of about 130,000 tonnes a year.
In acrylic fibres - used as a wool substitute - the merged business would be
Europe's number two, with capacity of between 195,000 and 215,000 tonnes a
year.
European capacity is about 830,000 tonnes a year, according to Mr Simon
Garmston, senior partner at PCI-Fibres and Raw Materials, the specialist
consultants.
The deal, which is scheduled to be completed this autumn, gives Courtaulds
greater access to the European textiles sector, said Mr Huismans. The
company has recently started producing a new textile product in the US
called Tencel, but its strength in European viscose is manufacturing
non-textile unwoven products.
Hoechst has been hit by the decline of the European textiles industry.
'Prices are horrible,' said Mr Jean-Louis Juvet, director general of the
Brussels-based International Committee of Rayon and Synthetic Filament. 'All
but Courtaulds are losing money,' he said.
The European acrylic fibre market has been more stable, but has been
affected by a slowdown in demand from China, the world's largest importer.
Hoechst does not have sufficient volumes to make money in present
circumstances, said Mr Juvet.

FT  27 MAY 93 / NW Water in scrip dividend offer: Scheme likely to be
followed by other water groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH WEST Water yesterday began the privatised water companies' reporting
season by announcing a 7 per cent increase in profits.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 230.1m to Pounds 247.1m in the year to
March 31, mainly because of price rises but helped by a larger contribution
from unregulated businesses like process equipment.
North West also announced it was offering shareholders an enhanced scrip
dividend. Like the other water companies, North West is unlikely to have to
pay any mainstream corporation tax for several years because of high capital
allowances.
The enhanced scrip scheme will help eliminate unrelieved advance corporation
tax. Money saved will be invested in North West's international business.
Ofwat, the water regulator, was informed in advance about North West's plan
and expressed no concern, the company said.
Analysts said other water companies are now expected to launch enhanced
scrip schemes over the next few weeks.
Turnover increased 11.3 per cent to Pounds 877.9m after average annual price
rises of 9 per cent. At the interim stage, profits were 5.7 per cent higher
at Pounds 130.7m on sales of Pounds 421.7m.
North West said it continued to cut costs and lifted operating profits 17
per cent to Pounds 288.2m. There were provisions of Pounds 36m for future
redundancies. Since 1991, staff numbers have been cut by 25 per cent to
5,400. Non-core businesses, built at a cost of Pounds 150m since
privatisation, made operating profits of Pounds 20.3m before development
costs for overseas projects of Pounds 9.6m. Lower costs at process equipment
lifted profits 42 per cent to Pounds 18m.
Interest costs more than doubled to Pounds 41.1m as the company's capital
spending programme gathered pace. Net borrowings increased from Pounds
296.4m to Pounds 534.6m. Gearing increased from 18 per cent to 29 per cent,
while interest cover remained comfortable at 6.9 times.
Earnings per share increased 7.6 per cent to 62.3p. The company recommended
a final dividend of 14.27p to make a total of 21.4p, an 8.8 per cent
increase. The enhanced scrip alternative is equivalent to a dividend of
21.405p. Swiss Bank Corporation has agreed to buy any new shares at a value
equivalent to 20.9769p, or 98 per cent of the enhanced dividend.

FT  27 MAY 93 / British Coal offers cut-price supplies to power generators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL has offered to sell additional coal to the two largest
electricity generators at prices less than two-thirds of those in existing
contracts in an effort to save the 12 pits reprieved in March after a public
outcry over pit closures.
The offer came as the High Court yesterday ruled that the corporation could
go ahead with the shutdown of the first 10 pits in its closure programme.
The cost of keeping the 10 mines open since last October, when the
government first retreated on the closure programme in the face of fierce
cross-party political pressure, is understood to approach Pounds 100m.
British Coal estimates it has spent Pounds 13m a month to keep each pit open
since production in them stopped. The National Union of Mineworkers has
calculated the total cost to the public purse to be more than Pounds 150m.
The pits covered by the judgment are Cotgrave, Silverhill, Grimethorpe,
Houghton Main, Markham, Trentham, Parkside, Betws, Taff Merthyr and Vane
Tempest.
British Coal's offer to cut prices follows a government pledge to subsidise
output from the pits provided British Coal could find markets for them.
The talks with National Power and PowerGen, the generators for England and
Wales and the corporation's main customers, have confirmed how tough the
sales drive will be - initial signs are that at least one of the generators
believes the price of 90p-95p a gigajoule - the unit of energy from coal -
is too high.
Although the generators have indicated a willingness to talk, they have
emphasised that high stockpiles mean there is no strong need for them to
take any additional tonnages. Their stocks mean they can drive a hard
bargain on the price.
The 90p-95p price compares with European spot price, as charted by McCloskey
Coal Information Services, the independent analyst, of 86p delivered to
Rotterdam. It is thought that the generators will argue they can get similar
prices to the UK.
Neither British Coal nor the generators would comment yesterday. However, Mr
Malcolm Edwards, former marketing director, said even if the generators paid
what British Coal was asking, the coal would produce the cheapest power in
the UK.
The final level of subsidy will depend on the sale and production price of
the additional coal. It is likely the total will fall well below the Pounds
500m envisaged by the select committee in January.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Protests as Bonn votes to tighten liberal asylum laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN parliamentarians, some of them airlifted to the Bundestag over
demonstrators in Bonn, voted last night to tighten the country's liberal
asylum laws.
Most members of the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) voted with
Chancellor's Helmut Kohl's governing coalition parties to back the curb on
asylum-seekers by 521-132, with one abstention.
The vote in the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, easily produced
the two-thirds majority needed to dilute the constitution's guarantee of
political asylum, which has drawn a flood of asylum-seeking refugees to
Germany. The constitutional changes are also expected to be approved by the
Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament, representing the federal states.
The vote came after a day of turbulence in Bonn, with the sounds of
anti-racist rock bands and police helicopters shattering the city's normal
calm. With 5,000 young protesters blocking streets, several hundred
parliamentarians used ferries or helicopters to reach the chamber near the
Rhine.
The vote climaxes two years of fierce debate over proposals to tighten
Germany's asylum laws. Pressure to curb the influx of asylum-seekers grew
after a spate of violent attacks last year. These raised fears that the
issue might be boosting far right parties and damaging Germany's image
abroad.
Until now, the constitution has granted any refugee the right to seek asylum
in the country. The curbs will allow Germany to send back asylum-seekers to
neighbouring countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic.
Refugees have been applying for asylum at the rate of 1,400 a day since the
beginning of the year. In 1992, some 440,000 asylum demands were filed.
'Only if we control and limit immigration more effectively . . . can we
ensure peaceful and amicable co-existence,' said Mr Wolfgang Schauble,
parliamentary leader of Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats, during the emotional
debate. He denied Germany was erecting barriers and dumping asylum-seekers
on its neighbours.
The German vote comes as EC interior ministers are preparing to approve
tough measures to control illegal immigration across the Community at a
meeting in Copenhagen next week.
The measures include stricter checks on foreign students and residents
working illegally inside the EC; a crackdown on people without residents'
permits; and closer monitoring of short-term visitors and tourists.
Germany has two-thirds of all asylum-seekers in Europe. But the EC move on
illegal migrants has been given impetus by the new French government and Mr
Charles Pasqua, its hard-line interior minister.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Hunt for winning ideas heads science research proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST new government strategy for science and technology for 21 years
was unveiled yesterday, with the emphasis on linking research more closely
to wealth creation.
The most innovative feature of the white paper on science is to introduce
'technology foresight' - a new method for picking the areas of research that
are most likely to produce winning products for British industry.
Mr William Waldegrave, minister for science, said the foresight exercise
would involve widespread consultation between his Office of Science and
Technology and experts from industry and universities.
They will look for a fit between promising areas for research and the
ability of UK companies to exploit the results - and the fields selected
will receive additional funding.
Another unexpected change in policy concerns new arrangements for training
postgraduate scientists and engineers. The master of science (MSc) will
become the normal first post-graduate degree and fewer students will go on
to earn a PhD.
The white paper also announces widely expected changes in the way the
government manages its Pounds 6bn-a-year spending on research and
development. For example, its two main advisory committees are replaced by a
new and more powerful Council for Science and Technology, chaired by the
science minister and containing senior representatives from industry and
universities. The five existing research councils, which disburse government
grants, are rearranged into six.
But there is no deep transformation of the existing science policy structure
and some government departments, notably the Ministry of Defence, which
spends 40 per cent of public R&amp;D funds, are hardly affected.
Industry broadly welcomed the white paper as providing a clear and
sympathetic policy framework for the next five to 10 years, while academic
bodies and scientists were more guarded - and opposition parties were
vociferous in their condemnation.
Mr Lewis Moonie, the Labour science spokesman, called it 'a complete
failure' and predicted that it would be a 'bitter disappointment' to
scientists. He said it failed to meet expectations 'on almost every key
issue facing British science and engineering today'.
Save British Science, the main scientific lobby group, complained that Mr
Waldegrave had failed to obtain any of the additional resources that would
be needed to implement the new strategy.

FT  27 MAY 93 / ITV takeover rules to be reviewed: Brooke to consider
allowing 'large' television companies to merge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER BROOKE, the national heritage secretary, is planning to launch a
detailed review of the rules preventing most independent television
companies taking over each other.
There is growing concern that as broadcasting becomes a more global business
the ITV companies may be too small to compete on the international stage.
The 1990 Broadcasting Act designated nine of the 14 regional ITV companies
as 'large' and therefore unable to take over each other.
Broadcasters such as Central Independent Television, in the Midlands, and
Carlton Communications, the weekday franchise holder in London and minority
shareholder in two other ITV companies, have been lobbying for a change in
the rules.
They have said that while most ITV companies cannot take over each other or
merge, any of them could be taken over by European Community companies from
the beginning of 1994.
Mr Brooke is very concerned that British broadcasting - an industry that is
highly regarded internationally - should not go the way of the British
motorcycle industry, for example, because of unreasonable restrictions.
He plans to call a meeting on the issue with all of the ITV companies. In
particular, he wants to hear the economic case why there should be a
relaxation of the rules to allow larger commercial television companies to
emerge in the UK.
The Independent Television Commission, the regulatory body for commercial
television, has made it clear to Mr Brooke it would not oppose such a move.
The ITC believes it would be possible to have a consolidation of ownership
while enforcing all the obligations in the separate regional broadcasting
licences, including local programme production.
The only merger since the passing of the Broadcasting Act has been between
Yorkshire and Tyne Tees in the north of England. Tyne Tees was the largest
of the five 'small' ITV companies and was taken over with the approval of
the ITC.
Some ITV companies have been asking for an extension of the blanket
moratorium on hostile takeovers which runs out on December 31. This is
unlikely to be granted by the government.
There is clearly more sympathy for arguments that more ITV mergers should be
possible to get economies of scale and create a critical production mass.
Changing the rules on ITV ownership has the additional attraction for the
government of not requiring primary legislation.
If the government does change its mind on allowing 'large' ITV companies to
merge it could enable, for instance, Mr Michael Green's Carlton to take over
another major such as Central.

FT  27 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It almost seems as though there is nothing to fear from the government's
gilt-edged auctions any more. Yesterday's sale had a lower cover ratio than
the previous two. But at nearly 1.6 times, cover was well up on the January
and February sales. Equally encouraging was the lack of tail - or difference
between the average and lowest accepted price. The danger is that, as the
auctions become routine, the markets will automatically expect them to
proceed smoothly.
The immediate reaction to an auction result is often more an indication of
how well market-makers positioned themselves than of overall demand. But
other factors may have influenced the positive response to yesterday's
auction. The issue involved was deliverable into the futures contract which
effectively permits institutional investors, not just market-makers, to go
short beforehand. There may thus have been some additional short-covering
after the auction.
There is also some overseas interest. Investors are disillusioned with the
D-Mark after the Danish vote in favour of Maastricht, and with the dollar as
worries mount about both the US recovery and inflation. At some 130 basis
points over those on German paper, sterling yields look attractive. The
trouble is that investors who buy on the basis of such differentials can
quickly turn sellers. A better measure of how the funding programme is going
is perhaps the 50 basis point rise in 10-year yields since March. There is
probably room for more as the weight of supply increases.

FT  27 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Courtaulds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Far from making the rights issue the market feared, Courtaulds did not even
offer an enhanced scrip dividend with its full-year results. Plenty of other
companies with Pounds 39m unrelieved advance corporation tax and chunky
capital expenditure plans would have leapt at the opportunity, but that is
not Courtaulds' style. Even so, gearing of only 40 per cent owes a lot to
the cash extracted from the pension fund surplus before the year end.
Profits were equally flattered by a pension fund credit, which will be
Pounds 9m lower this year, and by translation of overseas profits into
sterling at an attractive rate.
Whether Courtaulds' main markets improve before its luck turns in the
currency markets remains an open question. The outlook in defence and
aerospace is hardly encouraging, although weaker sterling will almost
certainly make for better export prospects this year than in the first half
of last. The joint venture with Hoechst in acrylic and viscose fibres also
looks adroit. Since Courtaulds' existing capacity is at full stretch,
operating margins on the Pounds 130m new turnover to be consolidated should
eventually be well up with the group average of 10 per cent - although
possibly not before a restructuring charge.
That suggests another tough year to come. But while there are many other
industrial companies more geared to recovery, an increased dividend covered
more than twice by earnings makes Courtaulds stand out from the crowd.

FT  27 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: France
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The details of France's massive privatisation programme highlight how the
process is being driven by pragmatic politicians with financial problems to
solve rather than wild-eyed ideologues with dogmas to prove. Despite Mr
Edmond Alphandery's free-market training at the University of Chicago, the
economy minister has adopted a typically Gallic approach. The state will
retain significant influence over its 21 liberated offspring by means of
extensive golden shares and privileged shareholder groups. Such measures
will doubtless irritate investors reared in Anglo-Saxon markets but are
unlikely to deter them if the pricing is right. This may prove tricky given
recent wobbles in the economy and stock market.
The government may eventually raise up to FFr500bn selling off the biggest
of the 2,600 companies it owns. This will make a big dent in France's
national debt. It will also provide more flexibility in softening the
effects of its recent budgetary rigour. The government is now busy devising
neat ways of attracting domestic investors through tax incentives. This
week's FFr40bn government bond, which can be converted into equity in
privatised companies, represents another ingenious enticement.
Yet the real stimulus for investors would be further interest rate cuts.
This would simultaneously suck funds into the market by decreasing the
attraction of cash while reassuring investors that the damage to the
underlying economy would ease. A gesture from the Bundesbank may yet prove
the French government's saving grace.

Residents of Manchester and Liverpool may be surprised to learn that their
environment is similar to that in Malaysia, Bangkok and Mexico City. But
that is the view North West Water takes of their plumbing when it argues
that its overseas diversification programme is a low-risk extension of its
existing business. International activities are, however, rarely as simple -
or indeed profitable - as optimistic managers fondly believe at the outset.
Joint ventures also bring an added level of complication and potential
mishap, while 30-year operating contracts in the developing world may carry
additional risks.
Investors may thus be unhappy that the Pounds 60m of cash saved by North
West's enhanced scrip dividend will be ploughed into its loss-making
international operations. Especially since the company has not seen fit to
explain what returns it expects to earn abroad or even when those operations
will become profitable. It must also be questionable whether a recently
privatised utility has the management strength to tackle a large portfolio
of foreign operating contracts.
Since other water companies also have high capital expenditure and
unrelieved advance corporation tax, more enhanced scrip dividends may be
expected. Ofwat, while not directly involved, may view them as a sensible
tool to help balance debt and equity finance. Though whether they prove to
be any more than a one-off will depend both on the Inland Revenue, and on
whether Ofwat regards 50 per cent increases in scrip dividends as an
acceptable price to pay.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Europe's refugees
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S MOVE to tighten restrictions on the flood of asylum-seekers is, in
its own terms, wholly understandable. Last year this flood amounted to
440,000 people, plus at least another 180,000 coming from Yugoslavia outside
the asylum category. Because of Germany's past, the revision of the very
liberal constitution in a more restrictive direction raises powerful popular
emotions, as testified by the demonstrations outside the Bundestag
yesterday. But no democratic country can be expected to accommodate an
unrestricted torrent of refugees, because it must create unbearable social
tensions as well as unacceptable budgetary costs.
But if Germany's constitutional reform is a perfectly understandable
emergency reaction to a crisis, it is not in itself a solution to the
problem. Under the new dispensation, the German authorities will be able to
expel most asylum-seekers who arrive across land frontiers, on the grounds
that their asylum requests should first have been dealt with by the
authorities of these 'safe' neighbouring countries.
This principle is an extension of the Dublin agreement between the 12 EC
countries. Wherever an asylum-seeker first sets foot in the Community, that
is the country which is responsible for examining, and either granting or
denying, his asylum request. The German government is now seeking to extend
this principle to other, non-Community countries; it has already concluded a
treaty with Poland to this effect, and is seeking a similar agreement with
the Czech and Slovak republics.
A restrictive reform of the German constitution is not by itself a solution,
however. First, asylum-seekers will be at least as serious a problem if they
are expelled to Poland or the Czech Republic. Second, many of those now in
Germany who fail to secure asylum status may secure the right to stay on
other, humanitarian grounds. Third, Germany's refugee crisis is only the
most acute aspect of a Europe-wide problem.
Most west European countries are now facing rising refugee pressure, and
many of them are seeking to tighten the rules to make their frontiers more
nearly watertight. Britain is in the process of passing a more restrictive
version of its asylum law. France is backing out of the Schengen
open-frontiers agreement, embarking on a systematic police search for
illegal foreigners, and restricting access to French nationality.
Exclusion is an understandable emergency reaction. It needs to be followed
by more constructive policies, on a Europe-wide basis, for dealing with the
reality of large numbers of people who will not disappear because they are
denied refugee status. Europe must afford reasonable humane protection for
those manifestly in need of it, whatever the definition. But it all
underscores the importance of Europe taking more energetic measures to help
stabilise countries from which the refugees come.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Private projects
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S private finance initiative could transform the way in which
important capital projects are carried out in the UK, Mr Norman Lamont told
a conference organised by the Confederation of British Industry yesterday.
If true, this would not be before time. The comments of Mr Francois
Mitterrand on the contrast between the two rail links to the Channel tunnel
have merely reminded the public how urgently this transformation is needed.
The new rules, announced in last year's Autumn Statement, overturned the
Treasury's longstanding view that the private sector should not undertake
anything the public sector could, in principle, do more cheaply. Any project
can now go ahead, provided government contributions give value for money to
the taxpayer, private participation in joint ventures is usually decided on
the basis of competition, and substantial risk is assumed by the private
sector.
The government is looking for three kinds of private involvement in
infrastructure: development and implementation of projects in the private
sector; greater use of operating leases, in which the private lessor retains
some responsibility for managing the asset; and joint ventures between the
private and public sectors, such as London's Crossrail.
There are two reasons for wanting private involvement in infrastructure. The
silly reason is to evade constraints imposed by limits on public borrowing.
The sensible one is to improve efficiency.
Private finance is not, insists the chancellor, about evading public
expenditure controls. He protests too much. One reason for the initiative is
indeed to evade such arbitrary constraints. The problem is not simply the
Treasury's past unwillingness to distinguish capital from current spending.
It is the failure to go beyond annual cash-flow accounting. What is needed
is a public sector balance sheet, in which increases in assets can be set
against liabilities.
The chief justification for greater private sector involvement is, however,
in Mr Lamont's words, to harness 'private sector skills - in design, in
construction and, above all, in management'. This is to be distinguished
from pricing. Charging users does not entail private ownership and private
ownership does not entail charging individual users.
What is essential is private sector risk-taking. Otherwise, hopes for
greater financial discipline will be disappointed. The government must not
only state that financial failure will lead to liquidation, but stick to
that hard line in practice.
The government's initiative for private finance is to be welcomed, mainly
because it may lead to better projects, though private participants must
face risks if this is to happen.
Subject to that proviso, Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI, was
right to tell the government to get a move on. The new ideas can be
beneficial, but not if they are stuck in the Treasury's pending tray.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Dull can be dynamic: The Eurobond market has been
transformed since its launch 30 years ago
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In June 1963, Autostrade, an Italian financing agency, issued Dollars 15m of
bonds through S G Warburg, the UK merchant bank, to build a motorway. Since
then, companies, banks, governments and agencies have borrowed more than
Dollars 2,000bn on the Eurobond market, according to IFR Securities Data,
which tracks Eurobond issues.
Once a small offshore market designed to circumvent regulatory barriers, the
Eurobond market today boasts outstanding bonds totalling an estimated
Dollars 1,300bn. Turnover in the market reached more than Dollars 7,000bn
last year, according to the International Securities Market Association
(Isma), the industry's trade body.
As dealers gather today in Copenhagen for Isma's annual meeting, they will
be celebrating the 30th anniversary of a market which has undergone radical
change.
'The market is virtually unrecognisable from the early days,' says Mr
Stanislaus Yassukovich, former head of the Securities Association and of
Merrill Lynch Europe. 'It is a high-volume, low-margin business, which no
longer requires the amount of executive attention that it got in the early
days.'
Twenty years ago, those entering the City from Oxbridge or the army became
stockbrokers. But by the middle 1980s, any lingering sense that working in
the Eurobond market was inferior had been cast off. The influx of US banks
and securities houses brought a spirit of meritocracy to the City, plus
competition between houses, which fuelled innovation but squeezed profits.
Some old hands lament the passing of the so-called 'star' system of
prominent bankers who once held sway over the market and were credited with
its growth.
'It has moved from a market dominated by individuals to a market dominated
by companies,' says Mr John Langton, chairman of Isma, who began his career
in the back office of Strauss Turnbull, a brokerage house.
Today, there are no personality cults, and nights at Annabels have been
curtailed by the demands of 7am starts. Traders who used to work on gut
instinct do not make a move without running charts through a computer.
'From the point of view of career satisfaction or intellectual interest,
it's duller,' said Mr Yassukovich.
But there are compensations - profit for one. The mature Eurobond market
which is emerging at the end of its third decade is also more lucrative. In
the 1990s, perhaps dull is good, because some of the reasons for the
market's new-found dullness are also at the root of its dynamic growth.
Over the past 10 years, retail investors, once easy game for aggressive
salesmen, have all but disappeared from the market, preferring instead to
place their money in pension funds or other collective investments. As a
result, the investor base of the Eurobond market now consists mainly of
professional institutional investors, whose analysis of the market is more
rigorous.
In addition, US houses started to use their own capital to trade themselves
from so-called 'arbitrage' desks. Initially, they made money by taking
advantage of the anomolies which existed between markets, but these were
gradually evened out in another step towards more rationally priced markets.
Second, the 1980s were a period of regulatory liberalisation. As the
barriers between markets fell away, restrictions on investment disappeared,
and instead of being a separate entity, removed from any domestic market
denominated in the same currency, Eurobonds became virtually
indistinguishable from many domestic bonds. This blurring of the lines made
it easier to compare value between markets.
In addition, the Latin American debt crisis of the early 1980s left banks
nursing their wounds, and unable or unwilling to meet the financing needs of
companies in the buoyant years of the 1980s. Many turned instead to the
Eurobond market, again broadening the range of investments available.
Last, the advent of the swaps market, which allows borrowers to swap the
proceeds of a bond issue into whichever currency is required, created
further freedom of movement between international and domestic markets.
The Eurobond market is now a vital, if not essential, source of funding for
agencies, governments, banks and companies around the world. For example,
when the upheavals of Europe's exchange rate mechanism last September left
several governments in urgent need of fresh funds to replenish their
reserves, the Eurobond market proved the cheapest and quickest source of
funds available.
While some dealers may start to get misty-eyed as they reminisce in
Copenhagen tonight, not everyone harks back to a golden age. Many are
relieved that the market has at last cast off its barrow-boy image. Tales of
salesmen arriving in the Middle East, armed with briefcases stuffed with
bond certificates and a strong sales pitch, and returning with wads of
petro-dollars, make for colourful bar-room anecdotes but do not foster the
impression of professionalism which is now considered de rigueur.
In any case, memory can prove deceptive. 'Don't let them kid you,' warns Mr
Peter Luthy, a partner of Luthy, Baillie, a bond boutique. 'There were a lot
of dull people and dull times in the old days too.'

BRITAIN'S FIRST thorough review of science policy for 20 years will come as
an anticlimax both to those who advocated a radical shake-up and to
traditionalists who think the only thing wrong with the present system is a
severe shortage of funds.
There is no commitment to increase UK spending on research and development,
which has slipped in comparison with other industrialised counties. Nor is
there fundamental change in the 'dual support system', by which funding for
science is channelled primarily through the research councils and
underpinned by general funds for universities.
More disappointingly, the white paper hardly touches the R&amp;D activities of
other government departments. A short and complacent chapter on the Ministry
of Defence, which still accounts for almost half of public spending on R&amp;D,
offers no ideas on switching resources to the civil sector as military
research runs down.
Yet the review gets some things right. Splitting up the over-extended
Science and Engineering Research Council should give new focus to its
activities. The Advisory Board for the Research Councils - a confusing and
secretive mix of in-house policy-making and outside advice - deserves to be
abolished. The new director-general of research councils, advised by
independent experts but located firmly within the Office of Science and
Technology, has a much clearer function. Another welcome change is the
replacement of the Advisory Council on Science and Technology - which has
often seemed to do little more than produce worthy reports that everyone
ignores - with a more high-powered Council on Science and Technology chaired
by Mr William Waldegrave, the minister responsible for science.
But the white paper's most significant proposal is 'technology foresight', a
process already followed in a number of countries for achieving a better
match between publicly funded research and the needs of industry. The aim
should not be to pick winners in the form of specific projects but to
identify technologies or areas of research that satisfy three criteria: real
scientific promise; availability of strong research groups to do the work;
and companies willing and able to exploit the outcome of the research. There
is no point, for example, in the government spending Pounds 10m on a laser
research programme, however exciting, if the UK has no opto-electronics
industry to make lasers.
However, the foresight exercise can work only if experts from science,
industry, finance, consumer research and government work together. Companies
will have to show more commitment to relations with government R&amp;D managers.
And then they must be ready to pick up the results of priority research
programmes. In the end, the attitude of industry will determine whether this
white paper succeeds in harnessing Britain's scientific excellence to wealth
creation.

Not even a police escort was enough to get German foreign office mandarin
Dieter Kastrup to his desk through yesterday's left-wing demonstration in
Bonn against the tightening-up of asylum laws. His car was spotted and
forced into a side street under a hail of stones.
So he decided to smuggle himself into work under what, for a bureaucrat, is
a deep disguise. He took off his tie, and strolled casually up to the door.
The trouble was that the attendant took one look at his open collar, and
refused to let him in.
Fortunately his repeated claims to being state secretary led to the
summoning of security guards who, after demanding to see his identity card,
let him pass. Whereupon, of course, he replaced his tie.

A survey just published in Hong Kong seems to rebut the celebrated riposte
of philosopher C E M Joad when asked if a good man could be happy on the
rack: 'Yes - provided he is the saintliest of men, and it is the lousiest of
racks.'
The Asia-wide study by the Survey Research consultancy found that the
happiest nations were impoverished Indonesia and the Philippines, with 94
per cent of people questioned pronouncing themselves happy in each case. The
most depressed, on the other hand, were the rich Japanese a full 30 points
lower on the scale.
The survey firm summed up the findings with a Chinese proverb saying that,
while the contented can make light of poverty, the discontented will remain
so no matter how rich they be.
To which the Japanese might reply: 'But at least they can be miserable in
comfort.'

Determined to sell its policies to the Brits, the European Commission has
hired a public relations outfit called Kestrel whose press releases on EC
consumer protection measures have since flown far and wide. What they
haven't been doing, alas, is flying fast.
Take, for example, last month's attempt to interest the media in EC product
liability law. It fell flat, achieving only one small and bilious snippet in
the whole of the national press. Perhaps that was because the law is five
years old.
To cap that, however, the 'News-Urgent' missive that winged its way to the
nation's editors yesterday managed to be both too late and too early at the
same time. Its subject was a consumer contracts directive adopted by EC
ministers seven weeks ago, which will not take effect until 1995.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The snooty Enarquy - students of the Ecole Nationale d'Administration,
France's equivalent of the Ivy League and Oxbridge combined - never did like
short-lived prime minister Edith Cresson's idea of banishing them from their
leafy Paris headquarters to Strasbourg.
The Cresson plan, ostensibly part of the Socialists' decentralisation
programme to move public institutions to the provinces, was always seen as a
thinly disguised affront to the ENA whose products abound in political high
places.
But the Enarques have battled back. Only two months after the Socialists
lost power, a government commission has asked for the Cresson edict to be
dropped. The matter has now been passed on to a Paris magistrate's court
which will have the final decision on whether ENA can stay parked in the
capital.
No prizes for guessing the outcome now.

<TEXT>
Are you a charismatic leader? If so, you would be well advised not to
mention the fact in a job application, not even if you are committed and
dynamic into the bargain.
All of those terms are on a black-list being circulated by London headhunter
John Courtis of phrases now odds-on to send executive candidates' hopes
crashing into the recruiter's waste bin.
It is likewise best to avoid describing yourself as seeking a new challenge
either as a self-starter, team-player, communicator, strategist or
conceptual thinker - whether or not successful, market-oriented, loyal,
assertive, conscientious, innovative, and/or enthusiastic.
One of the few claims that remain admissible in the Nasty Nineties, he says,
is membership of the high-IQ society Mensa . . . but only if you have since
resigned.
A further point, which might be useful to executives still in jobs as well
as to those seeking them, emerges from Courtis's advice on applying through
consultants, as distinct from directly to an employer. 'Never refer to them
as agencies,' he warns.
'Most agencies will be flattered if you call them consultancies. Nearly all
consultants will be offended if you call them agencies.'
So anyone with a score to settle against McKinseys or the like, now knows
how to proceed.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Economic Viewpoint: What the Budget could look like
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Portillo's celebrated scrutiny of UK public spending is not strictly
what the Americans would call a zero-based review. In other words, it does
not ask if there would be a National Health Service or state education if we
were starting in a new country with a clean sheet. But within roughly the
framework of existing institutions, it is meant to ask fairly fundamental
questions about coverage, methods and means of payment.
Less clear is the period of time meant to be covered. The main impact of any
radical decisions would be felt after 1995-96, the period covered by present
medium-term plans. As for the coming two financial years themselves, the
official attitude seems to be that any savings would be welcome, but no one
is counting on too much. In fact some unpopular moves may be required to
enable the government to stay within the ceilings for the present three-year
period which have supposedly been agreed by the cabinet.
Meanwhile a lot of work is being done on how best to measure the
government's deficit. One of the stock subjects of business indignation
relates to the absence of a proper public sector capital account. The famous
Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) resembles a confusingly combined
profit and loss and capital account. This seems to many trained in the
private sector a recipe for confusion.
The chancellor in fact promised in his Mansion House speech last October
that the first unified Budget to be presented towards the end of this year
'will be drawn up in a way that makes a proper distinction between current
and capital transactions'. He added that this would underpin 'the
government's commitment to infrastructure investment in the longer run'. It
will also make the Budget deficit look smaller.
There are undoubted benefits in presenting the public sector accounts in as
similar a way to private sector ones as possible and also in having the same
kinds of accounts for different parts of public sector. Very often however
this reform is put forward as a panacea by people who do not understand the
fundamental differences between government and business. Sometimes the
motive seems to be to find a way of reconciling calls for economies in
government spending in general with more spending in areas in which the
critic happens to be interested.
The best way to see both the value and the limitations of a separate public
sector capital account is to try to do so oneself on the back of an
envelope. Such an effort can never hope to anticipate exactly the
distinctions that Treasury officials will come up with next November, when
moreover fresh estimates of revenue and expenditure will be available But it
should reveal the main contours.
The tables in this article are a simple rearrangement of the last table
(7.9) in the Red Book accompanying the 1993 Budget. In the Red Book itself
the items are just classified as receipts or expenditure. Here the spending
items normally regarded as capital by national income statisticians have
been segregated from the others. (The expenditure 'reserve' has also been
divided between capital and current.) There is, however, a reluctance in the
Treasury to apply the same treatment to Pounds 7bn of so-called capital
receipts. This is a category covering items such as capital gains tax which
is indexed and is not really levied on capital.
If we apply the suggested procedures to the estimates already given at the
time of the March Budget, the result is to divide up the envisaged Pounds
50bn PBSR into a current deficit of about Pounds 30bn, a capital spending
total of nearly Pounds 25bn and an offsetting inflow on financial
transactions of some Pounds 5bn. (The latter are mainly privatisation
receipts.)
The Treasury has in some recent publications shown a higher figure - of
about Pounds 30bn - for public sector asset creation. This has been reached
not only by ignoring the revenue side, but also by adding in investment by
the nationalised industries and other public corporations. This is cheating.
For, in a reform introduced by a Labour government in the 1970s,
nationalised industry was excluded from the public spending total, so long
as it was self-financed and not a charge on the Treasury.
At between 5 1/2 and 6 per cent of GDP, the UK public sector current deficit
shown in the table would be substantially lower than the 8 cent of GDP
represented by the PSBR; and it is more plausible to believe that most of
the lower figure is due to recession.
The instinct of the traditional Treasury official is to say that the whole
PSBR has to be financed irrespective of how one chooses to divide it up.
Indeed the chancellor next November may well try to have it both ways - to
emphasise the lower current deficit to the financial markets while telling
spending departments that the whole PSBR has still to be financed.
Indeed there are ways in which official estimates of public capital
expenditure over-estimate the amount of spending for longer-term productive
purposes. How many of those who clamour for more capital and less current
spending realise that nearly Pounds 6bn of military spending counts as
capital? On the other hand the payment of salaries to science teachers
counts as current expenditure.
The current-capital distinction is not nearly as illuminating here as it is
in the private sector. The basic point is that government lacks the simple
business test of intended future cash return to decide what really is its
capital spending. So the division between current and capital is much more a
conventional demarcation between payments for resources which are used up in
a single year and those which leave buildings, machines or stocks of
equipment behind.
There is indeed an almost unlimited number of respectable ways of defining
the Budget deficit. But to pursue them all is not consistent with continued
sanity. Here, however, are a few hints.
You can reduce the deficit further by asking for it to be estimated on an
inflation-adjusted basis. Even at current relatively low rates of inflation,
a large proportion of government interest payments can be regarded as
compensation to debt-holders for the falling value of money. Moreover, the
government has never seen fit to publish a cyclically adjusted deficit which
would eliminate that part which is just the reflection of recession.
If, on the other hand, you think the tentative separation of capital from
current spending in the tables lets the government off the hook too lightly,
try insisting on measuring capital spending net of depreciation. If you do
that, you will be back not far from the original PSBR figure. If you want to
make deficits look larger still, add on something for the unfunded social
security liabilities in the next century as the population ages.
In the most highbrow circles of all the key concept is the primary deficit
before debt servicing. The point is that a sufficient primary surplus is a
pre-condition for reducing the level of national debt or its ratio to GDP.
The primary balance was indeed mentioned by Mr Portillo last week - the
first time by a British Treasury minister.
Its application produces bewildering results. The UK has the highest primary
deficit among the industrial countries. On the other hand, Greece, Italy and
Belgium - normally regarded as fiscal basket cases - emerge with quite large
primary surpluses.
What this means is not that the UK is worse off but that countries such as
Italy are in a fiscally bad way and gradually getting better, while the UK
starts off from a pretty sound budgetary position but is gradually getting
worse. Hence the flap.
In the end experience shows how large a deficit a government can afford and
if that is too large no amount of playing with definitions can help.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Book Review: The 'sick and tired' trade policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
TRADING FREE: THE GATT AND US TRADE POLICY By Patrick Low
The Twentieth Century Fund Press Dollars 24.95, 297 pages
US autoworkers will tell you that there is a single, overriding reason for
the industry's plight - unfair foreigners who exploit government subsidies
and dump their models to gain market share in the US.
President Bill Clinton's economic team appears tempted by the same world
view. Mr Mickey Kantor has frequently expressed the view, during his first
few months as US trade representative, that foreigners must change their
unfair trading practices - whether it is EC subsidies for Airbus or the
labyrinth of non-tariff barriers which block US exporters from the Japanese
market.
The US is sick and tired of opening its market and playing by the rules
while foreigners twist the rules to keep US companies out. Moreover, abuse
of the multilateral trade rules laid down by the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade more than 40 years ago has brought the organisation into
disrepute and eroded US faith in multilateralism.
This rationalisation of the ills besetting US trade - and of 'realistic'
solutions - takes a severe and carefully argued beating in a book to be
published next month by Patrick Low, an economist in the World Bank's trade
policy unit in Washington. 'The greatest challenge of all in the trade
sphere is not how to deal with the misbehaviour of foreigners, nor how to
revamp the Gatt. It is how to confront the politics of responsibility
avoidance at home, and to design and implement policy in the national
interest,' Mr Low argues.
Underpinning his case with an analysis of 70 years of US trade policy, Mr
Low flags a growing danger of the US administration falling victim to the
same forces that led in 1930 to the ruinously protectionist Smoot-Hawley
Act.
'The dangers of pork barrel politics and unrestrained protectionism, from
which Congress insulated itself (after Smoot-Hawley), have been allowed to
creep back into the system,' he argues. Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act,
which gives Congress the power to punish unfair trading practices, allowed
the US to pursue gains for exporters without having to provide offsetting
market-opening reforms likely to anger protected domestic industries.
The Trade Act marked the end of a 30-year period during which gains for
exporters could only be negotiated multilaterally at the expense of
protection for domestic manufacturers. Section 301 also gave legal standing
to the concepts of 'unreasonable', 'unjustifiable' and 'discriminatory'
trade practices which underpin the 'responsibility avoidance' practised so
widely today.
According to Low, 'responsibility avoidance' involves two tendencies:
blaming problems in trade performance on 'unfair' practices by foreigners;
and disguising the US administration's role in setting up protectionist,
market-sharing agreements. This has been done principally through voluntary
export restraint deals, 236 of which were implemented in the 1980s.
Low argues that legal and procedural restraints on protectionist action have
progressively been eroded since the 1974 act, leaving only the
self-discipline of policy-makers as a safeguard for free trade.
Even this self-discipline is being eroded as Congress has chipped away at
the powers devolved to the executive in trade policy, seeking to promote
sectoral interests at the expense of national ones. Congress has withdrawn
delegated authority, introduced more protectionist statutes, and even
imposed instruments, such as section 301, which are inconsistent with the
Gatt. It is adamant that domestic laws should override obligations under
international trade laws if the two should ever clash.
'The US has been arming itself legislatively over the years in a way likely
to make policy more protectionist and more confrontational internationally,'
he writes. This has created, he says, 'a situation in which trade
restrictions can take effect with no one in particular seeming to be
responsible for them'.
The result, he argues, has been to 'divert policy debate away from domestic
failings and competitive difficulties, and focus it instead on the trade
policy behaviour of foreign governments and firms'.
Low believes the solution does not lie in rejecting multilateralism, despite
contrary claims of a growing body of economists in the US who argue that
there is no option but to pursue managed trade arrangements. He insists that
multilateralism is not out of date: 'It was never properly tried in key
respects. The system did not break down; it had never been applied.'
The Gatt was 'never complete', he argues. Key sectors such as agriculture
and textiles were excluded from the outset. Laws that were inconsistent with
the Gatt and which pre-dated the agreement were allowed to remain. Some
policy areas, such as subsidies, were never included. The agreement's
failings are not due to the fact that multilateralism has been tried, and
found wanting, but that a 'conspiracy of non-compliance' from the earliest
days of the Gatt left it fatally flawed.
Low also warns against learning false lessons from the short-term 'success'
of managed trade deals such as the US-Japan semiconductor accord. He
describes them as a 'source of trade instability and political tension'.
Only a third of 301 actions from 1975 to 1990 had the desired result, he
says. Many triggered retaliation, and carried a high cost in terms of trade
friction. They are thus unlikely to achieve any more than short-term gains,
with foreigners 'reluctant to co-operate, resenting the unilateral,
intrusive and accusatory flavour of designations'.
If the Clinton administration is planning to pursue managed trade options,
it should first recognise the trends revealed by Low, and then address the
potent case he makes in favour of 'trading free'.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Letter: Lloyd's Names should have guarantee of profits
accruing to them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CLAUD GURNEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Messrs David Rowland and Peter Middleton (chairman and chief executive
respectively of Lloyd's) are to be congratulated for admitting frankly that
there has been massive deception, incompetence and worse at Lloyd's over the
last 13 years. No one should be surprised to hear that the only money that
Lloyd's has belongs to the Names and they have no magic cheque book hidden
away ('Lloyd's urges Names to settle grievances through negotiation', May
26). It is a little more worrying to hear that they still have no proper
information on which to manage the business - maybe underwriting should stop
until they do have such information.
They both spent much time explaining how they represented all Names, but if
they really do then they should follow the advice of the EGM2 which follows
on naturally from this statement:
(1) They should put together a package which will subsequently be voted on
by all Names and will require a two-thirds majority to be implemented. (2)
They should give all Names a shared and common interest in building a
profitable future for the society. The only way to do this is to guarantee
that 25 per cent of all future profits will accrue to the current Names
equally. This is a small price for corporate capital to pay for the goodwill
and assets of Lloyd's which belong to current Names and much less than they
would have to pay to set it up from scratch.
The only asset that Lloyd's has left is the goodwill and name of Lloyd's. If
they reckon that it can produce Pounds 900m in 1995 then it is worth around
Pounds 18bn. This money belongs to Names and we must make sure that it is
not given away to their friends. If they do not adopt this position freely
then an EGM to be lodged on Friday will force it upon them. Claud Gurney,
chairman,

FT  27 MAY 93 / Letter: Macbeth gripping, not a mess
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From JOHN and BARBARA RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Recently one of your correspondents wondered if your critic had
actually been to the event he was reviewing. We certainly wondered whether
we had been to the same production of Verdi's Macbeth at the Coliseum which
Richard Fairman reviewed ('Macbeth in a mess', May 22). His outright
rubbishing of this production left us wondering what we were in for, and led
to us offering one of our party his money back before we set out.
In fact, we all enjoyed Macbeth enormously; the production was gripping and
inventive; Kristine Ciesinski was as theatrical a Lady Macbeth as you could
hope to find; Verdi's brass writing had us on the edge of our seats; and the
chorus was as lusty as you could wish. One of us had recently seen the
Covent Garden Otello, and thought there was no comparison.
Good luck to Poultney in his new job. We only hope his successor can do as
well. As to your man Fairman, eye of a newt for him.

Sir, To have stated in your story 'Queen to be first UK monarch to meet

FT  27 MAY 93 / Letter: EBRD's role crucial, but review necessary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr L S DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The EBRD was established to 'foster the transition towards open-market
oriented economies and to promote private and entrepreneurial initiative in
the countries of central and eastern Europe'. Discussion on the merits of
its in-house expenditures should not be allowed to detract from the need to
review its performance towards achieving this objective.
A year ago this week, the European Commission hosted a conference designed
to review barriers to business investment in eastern Europe and to identify
solutions to the problems. Research had shown that more than one-third of
potential investors felt the risk/profitability were unacceptable. A further
20 per cent could not get finance. In this climate, the EBRD could clearly
play a useful role.
In practice, the bank's criteria for project approval mean it will find it
difficult to bridge the gap. Any project for eastern Europe will need to
bear a range of 'exceptional' costs for activities such as legal and
financial services and for management training, which are bound to reduce
its viability. If the bank fails to support these and continues to require
commercial viability, it will struggle to convert the 'commitments' to
'disbursements'.
What are desperately needed are projects such as the VW/Skoda venture in the
Czech Republic which, although they may not produce much profit in the
short-term, will certainly act as catalysts to move cash around the economy.
The EBRD could pump-prime these types of activity by redirecting some of its
planned in-house expenditures into supporting the aforementioned
'exceptional' costs.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Letter: EBRD's role crucial, but review necessary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID A J BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your continued attacks on the management of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, and on the 'lifestyle' of its chairman
('High fliers face internal scrutiny at EBRD', May 24), risk undermining the
effectiveness of an institution which is making an invaluable contribution
to the economic development of the countries of eastern Europe.
As someone who has had quite a few years' experience in doing business in
the area both before and after the collapse of the communist regimes, I
believe the creation of such an institution has provided a crucial
cornerstone for the structuring and provision of the necessary long-term
debt and capital that the economies of eastern Europe require.
The complexities and difficulties of doing business in the area are well
known and all would concur with the need for a supra-national body to
co-ordinate and establish a basis for an investment philosophy that will
contribute to long-term economic growth.
From the outside, the processes of the EBRD might appear to be cumbersome
and slow, but the fact is the bank is staffed by highly qualified
professionals who understand the business environment, the applicable
products and the credit criteria which must necessarily underpin the
provision of development capital.
You may well feel that some of the FT's readers are interested by the colour
of the marble, the use of corporate jet services and the cost of Christmas
parties, but I have no doubt that many others are more interested in what
the EBRD has done since its creation a mere two years ago.

<TEXT>
BAD BEHAVIOUR (15) Les Blair
MADAME BOVARY (PG) Claude Chabrol
JACK THE BEAR (12) Marshall Hershkowitz
BEING AT HOME WITH CLAUDE (18) Jean Baudin
COP AND A HALF (PG) Henry Winkler
VACAS Julio Medem
Noel Coward once wrote an acerbic lyric about people's behaviour away from
Belgravia. In Bad Behaviour the place is Hampstead, Belgravia's gipsy
sister, and people's behaviour there, as depicted in Les Blair's brilliant
improvised comedy, is colourfully and wittily appalling.
'Twas often thus, of course, in Hampstead: a place known for its searing
struggle between yuppification and Bohemianisation. Take town planner Gerry
and his wife Ellie (Stephen Rea, Sinead Cusack): a gentle, cultured, unkempt
couple who fall out with casual acquaintance Howard Spink (Philip Jackson)
when he, Howard, proves a heartless spiv with a cordless telephone. H. goes
around offering 'free advice' on building firms and then charging a
three-figure consultancy fee plus VAT. Even the builders he uses hate him.
They are the Nunn Brothers, identical cockney twins played by a
never-in-the-same-shot Phil Daniels.
Other walking wounded of NW3 include neurotic single mum Jess (Clare
Higgins) and Jess's permanently shellshocked daughter Rosie (Emily Hill).
Plus a sea of children, casual friends, a dog or three. But the wonderful
thing about this film, which resembles a Mike Leigh comedy notched up half a
social class by Alan Ayckbourn, is that the canvas never seems overcrowded.
Gerry and Ellie are the still centre of paralysed social mobility: a
liberated couple who dream of movement but cannot decide on up, down or
sideways. In the meantime their bathroom is a prey to the Nunn Brothers'
drills and chisels; their sitting-room fills up with the mad, bad and
dangerous, a surgery for the emotionally maimed; and outside, the frightful
Howard roams the land using his Cellnet as an instrument of torture.
Escape is urgent for everyone, even Jess who wants to clear off for a
weekend of spiritual uplift. ('It's a Buddhist monastery in Hemel Hempstead
and you have to book'). But this being North-west London, escape only ever
takes place in the mind: along with several other healthy human activities -
sex, murder, revenge - that should get out more but in Hampstead keep
vanishing up cerebral cul-de-sacs.
Director Les Blair, who began as an editor-producer for Mike Leigh (Bleak
Moments) and then shaped improvised tele-gems like Newshounds and Honest
Decent And True, finds a perfect comic rhythm for this social-satirical
foxtrot. Slow, slow, quick, quick, slow, with sudden shifts to manic
overdrive (Howard) or Celtic narcolepsy (Gerry).
Though the whole cast is a joy, we must pick out the mop-headed charm and
beatific distractions of Stephen Rea. He looks like an overgrown sheepdog;
he acts as if he has just got out of bed and wants to go back; and even his
hatred of the Irish-hating Howard has a frazzled illogic. 'Just knock off
the references to racial origin, you big limey bastard.' Bad behaviour as
inventive as this can give good behaviour a bad name.
Gustave Flaubert wrote a famous novel about bad behaviour and named it after
his culprit-heroine. Claude Chabrol's film of Madame Bovary sallies forth
once more to the blighted marriage bed, the dreams of romance, the horrors
of 19th century French provincial life: all those things that made Emma take
refuge first in adultery, later in arsenic.
The magnificent Isabelle Huppert plays her as a chalk-faced sphinx with
saucer-wide mouth and eyes prone to sudden shock or crimson-rimmed tears.
This woman has something worse than ennui: spiritual asthma. You believe she
is suffocating in the loving, boring arms of Charles (Jean-Francois Balmer);
that infidelity is an adventure as heady and unreal as those fictional
passions she has read; and that shopping her way to bankruptcy is for Emma a
way to turn invisible emotion into hard, clinking barter.
Ten out of ten for Miss H. But around her the film is Bovaryesque in the
wrong way. Instead of the crisp-edged satiric pessimism we expect from
Chabrol - who used to light the edges of his scripts in films like Le
Boucher and La Femme Infidele and watch the smoke get up our eyes and noses
 -here is a TV-style costumer as stuffy as it is static. The camera stands
on one side of the room, the characters on the other and the Great Dialogue
(taken verbatim from the book) flaps over as regularly, ineluctably as an
airport departure board.
Sometimes the blood quickens - how could it not in a 2 1/2 -hour film? The
tragedy of Justin's foot has the right curdled horror; and later Chabrol
catches the breathless desperation of a life lived between small town and
large town, between small lie and larger self-deception. But mostly this
Madame Bovary is game, set and match to Mlle Huppert, her victory made
somewhat hollow by the fact that there is no one the other side of the net.
Danny DeVito is everyone's favourite Dad in Jack The Bear. We know this
because the saccharine piano score tells us so. It goes 'Plinky plink plink'
while the images of bygone American suburbia (Oakland, California, early
1970s) sigh with golden-lensed recall. De Vito, who hosts a late-night TV
horror show, is the life and soul of the neighbourhood and at home acts the
perfect MC whenever his young son (Robert J. Steinmiller Jr) - whose voice
narrates the film - brings home a blushing girlfriend.
'He was an artist' coos Sonny's voice-over on one such night; 'what he was
creating was the perfect evening.' What director Marshall (thirtysomething)
Hershkowitz and writer Stephen Zaillian create, adapting a novel by Dan
McCall, is 98 minutes of consummate schmaltz. There has always been an
attraction, like opposite hues on the colour-wheel, between picket-fence
tweeness and Gothic menace. (See David Lynch's Blue Velvet). But here the
theme of innocence under threat, from the playtime gore of DeVito's TV show
to the flesh-and-blood fears provoked by neo-Nazi neighbour Gary Sinise,
becomes an ever more contrived contest between boyhood bliss and
bargain-basement bugaboos.
Being At Home With Claude begins as a movie but soon stiffens into the stage
play, by Rene-Daniel Dubois, on which it is based. We open with a
nerve-shredding montage of sounds and images: groans of seeming human pain
heard over black-and-white shots of a cityscape; blurry, scarce-decipherable
close-ups of two men making love; a wine-glass and knife shuddering off a
kitchen table; a splash of red blood across a fridge door.
Nasty but compelling. Thereafter, though, director Jean Baudin switches off
the arc-lamps and switches on the stage footlights. A theatric two-hander
unfolds as the supposed murderer (Roy Dupuis) is quizzed, endlessly, by the
dogged detective (Jean Godin) in a single-room setting occasionally
ventilated by flashbacks. Acted as if to the back of the gallery, the movie
should empty the front stalls in no time, rolling back the audience as the
minutes drag on.
For the rest, it is a clear choice between Cop And A Half starring Burt
Reynolds and Vacas starring a cow. The first is a Hollywood law-and-order
comedy with an ageing star wearing a wig, a police uniform and a look that
says 'This was the wrong movie to choose for a comeback.' TV ex-Fonz Henry
Winkler directs. Vacas is a Spanish allegorical fable about war, in which
the eponymous cow stands for - for - well, for about an hour and a half.
Obscure, but please be patient. Debut director Julio Medem escorts us
through over 60 years of Spanish history, delineating a Basque family whose
members splinter off into history much like the bits and pieces that fly up
from the early log-splitting contest. Or, indeed, like the movie's own
style: a dancing, fizzing, restless Magic Realism in which only the title
animal - representing Spain? God? Destiny? - offers a sure and sacral
immobility, a large-eyed, large-viewed wisdom.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Arts: Fassbaender at full steam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone who has heard - no, experienced - Brigitte Fassbaender in full, black
cry knows what to expect when the Kraken wakes. Her mezzo, which grows
deeper with the years, can carry an extraordinary charge of pain: exposed
but stoical, disabused, disdaining any kind of appeal for sympathy except
naked candour. In the Jon Vickers stakes for heart-seizing vocal Affekt, she
is a top contender.
That is a crucial factor in her recently developed Winterreise; but we might
have heard it coming as far back as her memorable Rosenkavalier Octavian,
with a young aristo's manly shyness and nervous dignity undercut, or
underpinned, by those forcefully poignant tones - or in her cool Capriccio
Clairon, darkly suggestive beyond the meagre role Strauss composed. There is
also tough, unwinking intelligence, and abrasive humour (she is a Berliner
by birth). In fact Fassbaender counts by now as a monstre sacre, and the
Wigmore Hall audience on Monday gave her a vociferous welcome.
What she sang, however, was a wide-ranging selection from Hugo Wolf's Morike
Lieder, to which her formidable powers are not ideally matched. She
delivered almost everything in the first half forte or fortissimo as if she
had come straight from Carnegie Hall and forgotten to adjust the volume. In
that, her excellent pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet vied with her: it was hard
to tell who was challenging whom for domination. As a result 'Auf einer
Wanderung', which is an iridescent vision, sounded as heartily down-to-earth
as 'Fussreise'.
There was more light-and-shade in the second half - though she belted out
the rapt 'Gesang Weylas' hymn, not a good idea. 'Der Feuerreiter' was of
course stridently dramatic but there were lovely measured nuances in 'Denk'
es, O Seele', one of Morike's death-haunted prayers, and in the radiant 'Im
Fruhling'. In the latter it was only to be expected that Fassbaender's
closing sigh (Alte unnennbare Tage] - 'Old, unutterable days]') should hint
at memories of a really unspeakable kind, just as in 'Nimmersatte Liebe' the
light erotic play of Je weher, desto besser - 'the more it hurts, the
better]' - would sound like raw masochism.
What hardly ever felt right was Thibaudet's pulse. Too often his address
seemed unfeelingly swift and bright, hustling the songs along before they
could cast any long shadows. Still, I look forward anxiously to hearing the
new Decca CD of this programme - for in the recording studio Fassbaender and
her partner must surely have scaled down their dynamics, and perhaps even
relaxed the pace.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Arts: The Changeling - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Here is one of the few Jacobean plays outside Shakespeare and Jonson that
has been repeatedly revived in the last few decades. It deserves to be so.
Written around 1622, The Changeling by Thomas Middleton and William Rowley
may have its deficiencies - a cumbersome subplot, for example - but it is
also compellingly and unusually dramatic. Few productions could be better
than that by Michael Attenborough, which has arrived at the RSC's Pit
Theatre in the Barbican from Stratford.
At the heart of it is an outstanding performance by Malcolm Storry as De
Flores, the man with a deformed face who is ready to kill in order to win
his equally evil love, Beatrice-Joanna. Before we give the praise to Storry
alone, however, we should recognise that there has been some fundamental
rethinking. This Changeling is presented as a warped love story, and becomes
in the end rather moving.
The technique is to make De Flores much less ugly than he usually his. True,
he has a scarred, burned face, though much less so on one side than the
other. But he also has charm, wit and intelligence. Played by Storry, he is
physically a huge figure, but not without grace in his movements. He
dominates the stage whenever he is there, and it is no surprise that Cheryl
Campbell's Beatrice begins to fall for him. Indeed the central thread of the
production is that you see this coming early on. Ms Campbell would surely
not demur if we say that this time it is De Flores rather than Beatrice who
is the star attraction.
Where the pair of them differ is that De Flores knows what he wants from the
start, and that is Beatrice at any price. She, on the other hand, thinks
that she can use him as the servant he is. When he has killed her betrothed
at her command, she remarks: 'Why, 'tis impossible thou canst be so wicked .
. . as to make his death the murderer of my honour]' But she learns fast.
There cannot be one law for the nobility and another for the lower orders.
They become partners in evil: she is no less infatuated than he is. As they
die together, they are in a way as striking as Antony and Cleopatra or Romeo
and Juliet. Only their world is different.
Nothing in the rest of the play quite stands up to this passionate affair,
though the entire production is well done and packs resources into the Pit's
limited space. The set, designed by Julian McGowan, is suitably sinister,
lizards on the bronze walls and a bronze of Christ on the cross. Do not
imagine that the dream sequence is a modern invention; it is there as a dumb
show in the original text. For all its macabre background, this could be a
modern psychological drama. You should see it before a great deal else in
London.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Arts: South Bank looks North - Music in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As if in response to the Barbican's lavish 'Tender is the North' festival of
last autumn the South Bank has come up with a modest Scandinavian
celebration of its own. Five concerts this week under the auspices of the
Philharmonia focus upon new music, and upon the work of Magnus Lindberg in
particular.
The presiding spirit is the Philharmonia's principal guest conductor
Esa-Pekka Salonen, and the first two concerts on Monday and Tuesday also
involved the Ensemble InterContemporain; in the final programme next
Saturday, which will include the British premiere of Lindberg's thrilling
and ambitious Kraft from 1984, Toimii, the experimental group founded by
Lindberg and Salonen, makes its London debut.
Born in 1958, Lindberg is now well established in the vanguard of European
music. The BBC has brought a number of his major scores to London - Kinetics
was heard at the 1991 Proms, and a commission, Corrente II, was included in
the Barbican festival last November; the London Sinfonietta premiered Marea
in 1990 and introduced the lucid and carefully wrought Joy a year later.
Such pieces have demonstrated Lindberg's harmonic assurance and his knack
for vivid invention, and the largest piece in the EIC's programme on Monday,
UR from 1986, is similarly charged with striking gestures and confidently
controlled long-range thinking. It was performed, though, without the
computer-controlled synthesiser material which the score suggests is an
integral part of the concept; the composer seems to have has resigned
himself to this acoustic version, though the work itself seems impoverished
as a consequence. But the potency of the exuberant Ablauf for clarinet and
percussion from 1988 and the concentrated solo-cello Stroke four years older
both seemed unimpaired in the forthright EIC performances.
The newest piece on display, Corrente, completed last year and included in
Tuesday's programme, suggests a new direction in Lindberg's music. In
turning away from the increasingly architectural harmonic structures of a
work like Joy towards a more fluidly dynamic process, Lindberg sets up
unbroken skeins of figuration which define and then revise their own
harmonic spaces. Ligeti seems the distant model, but though all the threads
are pulled convincingly together in the final pages there seemed something
disappointingly conventional about the working method, as though in looking
for a fresh impulse Lindberg has sacrificed something of his personality.
Both concerts also contained works by Lindberg's contemporaries. Salonen's
programme included his own Floof, a jokey and surreal piece of text-setting
vividly sung by Sarah Leonard, and more substantially the UK premiere of
Jouni Kaipainen's two-movement clarinet concerto Carpe Diem]. It is an
unremarkable piece, decking out a thoroughly traditional framework with
modish clarinet effects, but the performance was memorable for the solo
playing of Kari Kriikku, extraordinary in its seamless fluency, range of
colour and virtuoso elan. In some hands even the dreariest material can be
made compelling.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Arts: A zestful 'Belshazzar'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the oratorio Belshazzar had its first performance in 1745, it was
performed at the King's Theatre in the Haymarket, which Handel had booked
for the winter season. A composer with a talent for enterprise was evidently
an acceptable figure at the time - perhaps Lloyd Webber has more illustrious
predecessors than one imagined.
For this performance in the Covent Garden Festival we were back on hallowed
ground, in St. Paul's Church. The performance did not go the full distance
in 'authentic' performance practice, but it captured much of the zest, the
strong dramatic atmosphere that is at the root of so many Handel oratorios,
despite a penny whistle serenading us from outside in the piazza.
The conductor, Peter Ash, and the Covent Garden Festival Orchestra performed
the score with few cuts (none at all in the choruses, for which the New
Company Choir proved more than adequate). The main four soloists lost an
aria each and couple of da capo repeats were snipped out. I doubt that many
people complained when they were sitting on hard church pews. Audiences in
Handel's day must have had 'authentic' bottoms which were more resilient
than ours.
In any case, in its central act where Belshazzar indulges in his revels,
this is a vividly-dramatised work. Handel sets the scene of the writing on
the wall with great skill, varying the pace so that he can build a scene of
mounting cumulative power - the gift of a practised opera composer. The
central figure of Belshazzar is keenly drawn, a young man, reckless,
assertive, in Jamie MacDougall's forthright portrayal.
The acoustics in this church are good for solo singers, probably rather
flattering. Carol Smith offered a mix of period purity and deeper colours in
the soprano music of Nitocris and Jonathan Kenny made a plangent
counter-tenor Daniel; Michael Druiett was the bass Gobrias. All the solo
numbers, however, were decisively trumped when Jean Rigby marched on as the
general Cyrus to proclaim her victory with a display of proud and energetic
coloratura singing.
With its small garden in which the audience can relax during the interval,
St Paul's Church makes a distinguished venue and the least I can do is get
its architect right: he was of course Inigo Jones, not Wren, as I stated on
Tuesday.

<TEXT>
This is the evening you have been looking forward to for ages, when the TV
promises such a dire selection, you can comfortably curl up with a good book
instead.
Tales from the map room (BBC2, 8pm), a series on the history of maps,
tonight looks at map-making during the First World War tank battles of
Cambrai.  Rik Mayall presents (ITV, 9pm) was oddly compelling last week, and
this second one hour comedy-drama may please some.
But who on earth watches Sylvania Waters (BBC1, 9.30pm), surely the nastiest
piece of 30 minute tackiness now available on international TV? A
fly-on-the-wall documentary about an Australian family, it has no redeeming
features at all; quite in line with most current TV production standards
really.
My advice is to switch on Radio 3 instead and listen to one of the best
novelists in the US today, Alison Lurie (Night Waves, 10.45pm), discuss the
connections between fairy tales and modern story-telling.

<TEXT>
James Arnold-Baker, head of BBC Enterprises, is to be the next chief
executive of Oxford University Press.
Arnold-Baker has been in charge of all commercial operations of the BBC  -
from books and magazines to the sale of programmes abroad - for the past
seven years. Before that, he was a marketing executive at Fischer Price
toys.
The BBC executive simply saw an advertisement for the Oxford job and
applied.
'It's a very exciting opportunity,' said Arnold-Baker, whose BBC contract
does not expire until September.
'I have built a nice little business (at the BBC), but now it's time to move
on,' said Arnold- Baker, who is also a member of the BBC board of
management.
He believes there are real similarities between the BBC and Oxford
University Press. Both combine public service and commercialism.

FT  27 MAY 93 / People: Tyrrell finds home away from the Abbey
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
James Tyrrell, group finance director of Abbey National, is stepping down to
take up the same position at London International Group, the
condoms-to-photo-processing company with a market capitalisation only some 5
per cent the size of the Abbey. Ian Harley, appointed treasurer only last
summer, succeeds him.
The building society-turned-bank has earned a reputation for well-planned
management successions, and it is understood that last summer's reshuffle of
key executives confirmed Tyrrell in his feeling that it was time to move on.
Harley, then retail operations director, swapped jobs with Gareth Jones, who
had been managing Abbey's profitable treasury operation. Outsiders concluded
the two were being groomed for the top when Peter Birch, who turns 60 only
in 1997, retires.
Tyrrell, 52, a chartered accountant who trained with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, has
had a varied career. After a spell as finance director of Associated British
Cinemas, he worked with EMI Leisure Enterprises and EMI Records before
becoming managing director of HMV shops in 1979. From there, he moved to
Abbey National, initially as general manager, finance. He joined the board
in 1989, and it was on his watch as finance dir-ector that the conversion to
plc status was made.
Anything but a typical Abbey man, colleagues record that his office is
renowned for its collection of rock memorabilia alongside toy soldiers. He
earned the nickname 'squirrel Tyrrell' for his cautious nature, whilst
gaining a reputation for his intellect and command of detail.
Harley, a less extrovert figure, joined Abbey in 1977. His career pattern is
what one insider describes as 'a super example of horizontal progression'.
He has worked both in head office as group financial controller and in the
regions as, first, finance director and, then, operations director on the
retail side.
The current finance director at LIG, David Harbut, 55, announced a year ago
his intention to take early retirement. Tony Butterworth, LIG chief
executive, indicated Tyrrell would have been attracted by the multinational
nature of LIG's operations. Colleagues assumed Tyrrell's move to LIG meant
his sites were targeted on the chief executive's seat.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): An emerging taste
for strategic alliances - An alternative to takeovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the absence of any new wave of cross-border takeovers, are joint ventures
and other strategic alliances a better means of penetrating new markets?
Many European businesses seem to think so.
The absolute number of such deals fell last year, which is not surprising in
the depths of recession.
More significant perhaps is the position of joint ventures and strategic
alliances relative to the mergers and acquisitions arena. Figures from IFR
Securities Data and Amdata show that M&amp;A deals comfortably outpaced
alliances by more than six to one in 1990. But in the first four months of
this year the ratio had fallen to less than three to one.
That picture is confirmed in a report just published by the Conference
Board*, which indicates the 'high degree' of interest in joint ventures and
strategic alliances among respondents polled in a recent survey of top
European managers. It is also endorsed by advisers such as Price Waterhouse,
recently appointed to manage a UK government programme intended to help
small and medium-sized UK companies to establish closer links with US
businesses.
PW's John Peacock says: 'Joint ventures and strategic alliances have become
an increasingly popular way of developing new products and entering new
markets, often at a somewhat lower capital cost than investing directly or
by acquisition'.
Strategic alliances - distinct from mergers in that both sides retain their
separate identities - can take many different forms, and meet different
objectives. Take the late 1991 joint venture between Coors of the US and
Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the UK regional brewer, specifically to market and to
promote Coors' Extra Gold premium lager in the UK.
From S &amp; N's point of view, the licencing and distribution agreement added a
further brand to its portfolio of premium lager, allowing marketing and
promotion costs to be shared.
For Coors, the attraction was immediate, low-cost access to a new
geographical market via a proven distribution network.
Unilever has traditionally preferred to have full control of its businesses.
In the last year, however, the Anglo-Dutch group has formed a joint venture
with PepsiCo, the US soft drinks and snacks group, to sell canned iced tea
and with France's BSN to develop and market products combining ice cream and
yoghurt. An attraction for Unilever, which will have operational control,
was the chance to respond quickly to demand from US consumers.
Both the Unilever deals, and the 50:50 joint venture between General Mills
and Nestle to use the combined potential of their brands to develop a ready
to eat breakfast market, are offensive moves intended to create businesses
from scratch and build on the complementary strengths of acknowledged
industry leaders.
By contrast the decision by Pepsico and General Mills to merge their
existing European snack food operations - excluding the UK - in a 60:40
joint venture is a defensive move by two relatively weak players explicitly
limited to one region.
Elsewhere, the sale to Bell Canada of a minority shareholding in Cable &amp;
Wireless's Mercury telecoms subsidiary shows how different objectives can be
met.
For C &amp; W, the deal served to crystallise the value of Mercury into its
share price and reduced its gearing. From Mercury's point of view, it opened
a closer relationship with Bell's UK cable TV operators and access to
marketing and technology skills and a retail distribution network. For Bell
Canada, the deal not only provided a way into a new market, but offered
competitive market experience for a company faced with the ending of its
monopoly in telecom services.
The 50:50 joint venture between Wessex Water, one of the smaller UK
privatised water companies, and Waste Management of the US, also reveals
different agendas. Wessex was keen to diversify from its price-regulated
core water business into the waste management field. The deal leaves it
virtually bid-proof (having made its contribution via the issue of shares to
its partner). Waste Management has access to a new geographical market.
The apparent enthusiasm for strategic alliances goes against the grain of
executives trained to accept full responsibility for what they do. Many
fail, despite the amount of management time devoted to them.
It is too early to judge the recent crop of ventures. But the Conference
Board's report makes a useful contribution in this regard. Based on many
more established cases and also on new information from the European survey,
it seeks to set guidelines for successful alliance management. Among the
recommendations, the author suggests that participants should:
Conduct a cost/benefit analysis of favourable and unfavourable conditions.
Where possible, start an alliance small and build it up on trust.
Identify and address conflicts about activities critical to success,
deadlines, or government regulations.
Generate widespread internal political support.
Place operating managers on the negotiating team.
Send divisive topics to higher-level negotiation groups.
Structure the alliance with its own board of directors to speed the approval
process.
Not require the alliance to prepare two sets of financial control reporting
systems, one for each partner.
Stay alert to early signs of termination: inflexibility in adapting
operating procedures; combative negotiation style; conflict about management
appointments; a reluctance to re-invest.
In the termination process, determine what must be accomplished in order to
allow the remaining partner to keep the former joint activity going.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A universal message
 -Pan-European ads are increasingly common
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a dismal period for worldwide advertising generally, pan-European
campaigns for branded products represented a significant bright spot last
year.
According to Euromarketing, Advertising Age's London-based weekly
newsletter, the top 100 pan-European brands in the main EC markets in 1992
increased their TV advertising spending by 28 per cent. The Dollars 5.3bn
(Pounds 3.5bn) paid out by the big spenders amounted to 42 per cent of all
TV advertising in Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and
Spain, compared with a 38 per cent share the year before.
Such figures confirm the tendency for many multinational advertisers -
attracted by cost savings and the convergence of consumer taste - to treat
Europe as a single market. But it would be unwise to get carried away.
Pan-European advertising remains largely a television phenomenon; US
companies predominate (11 of the top 50 are American, including Kellogg's at
number one); and uncertainty and ambivalence remain, even among the
supposedly committed. A fifth of the biggest spending brands in 1991 in the
Euromarketing survey failed to make the top 100 a year later.
Of the factors driving companies towards greater use of Euro-brand
advertising, an important one is cost. Bill Britt, Euromarketing's editor,
says the recent rapid growth of pan-European marketing is partly inspired by
the financial savings.
'It's much cheaper to shoot just one commercial and then use it across
Europe. It's also cheaper for a company to assign one Euro-marketing manager
and to have more junior product managers, rather than full marketing
managers, at country levels.'
John Hegarty, creative director of the London-based independent advertising
agency BBH, which makes pan-European advertising for Levi Jeans, agrees. A
one minute television commercial costs about Pounds 300,000. By shooting a
single TV ad to span six European markets, Levi Jeans saved itself about
Pounds 1.5m.
Hewlett-Packard, the computer company, also cites cost efficiencies as one
benefit of its pan-European approach. Says Roger Wilson, its director of
communications and public affairs: 'We don't have advertising executives
across Europe any more'.
He adds: 'In our business, information technology, where products sometimes
have only six-month life cycles, we are absolutely convinced that marketing
and advertising could not be done any other way.
'The development cycle of the product is now so short you can only afford to
launch it once. The whole marketing process, including the advertising, is
now pan-European'.
Cars claimed the biggest share of pan-European advertising with 24 per cent
of the total of the top 100 brands. Renault, Fiat, Peugeot-Talbot and Ford
were all in the top 10.
Toiletries and cosmetics came next, with 14 per cent, food in third place
with 12 per cent and confectionery and laundry products both taking 10 per
cent.
David Newkirk, vice-president of management consultants Booz Allen &amp;
Hamilton, believes other, more fundamental factors are responsible besides
cost cutting. 'The young and the rich have very similar tastes the world
over, and that's what's driving the convergences in advertising and media',
he says.
Before he joined Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton in 1991, Newkirk was with American
Express, where he promoted its gold card services worldwide. 'Gold card
means prestige everywhere. But the way you signal prestige varies with
culture. The US gold card advertising was all about achievement and it was,
frankly, tacky in Europe. We had to change it. But the basic propositions
involved in products - be it freshness in soap powder, or odour-free in
toiletries, or young and trendy in soft drinks, or prestige in financial
services - those underlying needs are very similar wherever you go.'
Differentiation at local level is nevertheless important even for companies
with aspirations to be noticed internationally, Newkirk explains.
'McDonalds, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, run global campaigns but they still execute
them locally. Take Coca-Cola's new campaign featuring its return to an old
bottle shape. In the UK, that campaign is running heavily on posters in
bus-shelters, a medium that doesn't exist in the US. It's different again in
France because poster sizes are different there. Such differences in media
necessitate that a global advertising message is executed very differently
in different countries.
'It's going to be a long time before the media and the way people use media
converge, even if the products, the positionings, and the copy strategy all
converge,' he adds.
John Hegarty argues that pan-European advertising can work at a deep
cultural level, 'if you focus on the similarities rather than the
differences between people'.
'With Levis, people across Europe have a certain view of 'Americaness', and
the advertising can tap into that commonly held view. Cars are the same; our
experience of the car has developed in cohesion, transcending national
borders. But the Italian experience of olive oil is very different to the
British and it's harder - though not impossible - to do pan-European
advertising for products which have very different national associations.'
Miles Colebrook, president and chief executive officer of JWT Europe,
supports the idea that the most successful pan-European campaigns are those
which have got their central proposition clearly defined. How that is
interpreted locally is of less importance.
'Nestle Rowntree's chocolate bar Kit Kat is now sold throughout Europe with
the same slogan ('Have a break, Have a Kit Kat') but whereas in Britain the
TV ad features a children's puppet show, in Holland the voice-over is done
by a Dutch humorist. Neither would work at all in the other country.'
The further away from a TV screen, however, the more difficult many experts
say it becomes to create and to deliver a pan-European message.
Promotion and purchase practices, product sampling, dealing with the trade
and pricing are all local issues and are likely to remain so.

EXPERT SYSTEMS are also known as knowledge-based systems, KBS. An offshoot
of early artificial intelligence (AI) research, they are rule-based, using
the answers entered by users to refine the information and prompt the next
question.
An expert system 'shell' such as Crystal provides the KBS developer with a
framework linking questions, rules and screens. The rules are often derived
from one human expert and can include uncertainties, usually expressed as
percentages.

Next term, some of the youngest consultants in the country will come out of
their classrooms. Students from Westlands Upper School in Torquay, Devon
will be talking to businesses in the surrounding Torbay area, armed with a
computerised expert system called Pharos that gives advice on trading in
Europe.
The students seek a first-hand understanding of economics, in which the
computer system is a useful tool. If the plan works, the dialogue that takes
place should benefit students and businesses alike.
Pharos belongs to National Westminster Bank, which has been advertising its
services on television as an aid to business. For Westlands pupils, the
knowledge-based technology on which Pharos is based - a software product
called Crystal - is a familiar classroom tool. The pupils have used it for
18 months as an integral part of the work and in line with the requirements
of the National Curriculum.
Crystal is widely used in commerce and higher education to create expert
systems, but Westlands is the only school in the country to have licensed a
copy. Its existence there is largely due to the head of computing, Geoff
White, whose enthusiasm has led Westlands to set up Cress, the Centre for
Research into the use of Expert Systems in Schools. White developed an
interest in expert systems while taking a Dip. Ed and M. Ed in educational
computing. He has experimented with several generations of systems,
including the knowledge-based tools Linx and Adex.
Crystal, he discovered, was the only product with the power to provide
interactivity beyond the simple yes and no choices usually displayed. A
powerful 'expert system shell', Crystal allows for measurements,
calculations and other interactive information on which it bases its
decisions.
The verdicts delivered by the system are based on pre-programmed rules, the
common principle of all expert systems. White programs these rules into
systems designed as teaching aids for geography, history, science and other
subjects.
An early use for Crystal was to help pupils define and find likely sites for
Anglo-Saxon settlements. 'You don't have to spend as much time as you'd
expect teaching computing, because they do it intuitively,' White says.
One of White's Crystal programs, Facsite, is used to combine geography and
map-reading with information technology.
Class 10G is the first to use the new, purpose-built computer centre at
Westlands. The class, a mixed-ability group of 15 fourth formers - year 10
under the new educational grouping - is using Facsite as a follow-up to a
more conventional geography lesson. The task is to find a good site for a
new factory, starting with a map. The one handed out first is of Tamworth,
West Midlands and district.
The pupils sit in clusters of two or three at the screens, each group
sharing an Ordnance Survey map. As well as being a a practical exercise in
map-reading skills, Facsite deals with questions involving everything from
geology to local demography which come into play when siting a factory. It
raises questions about the relief of the land, the nature of its surface and
drainage, population and transport services, land prices, unemployment
levels and planning permission. Each screen displays a question and asks for
some input, such as a measure of the local population, giving an equation
based on land area. Pupils calculate the answers and feed them into the
system. Then, unless Facsite's answer rules out the site, it is on to the
next question. 'The first thing I look for is flat land, but it mustn't be
marshy,' explains 15-year-old Mark Walker. 'Then we look at the roads. We've
done this before on paper, but it's much more interesting using the
computer.'
Class 10G's teacher, John Birch, is head of humanities and geography at
Westlands. After 20 minutes going from group to group, he calls the class to
attention to explain a question of geology in one of the maps. Teaching with
Facsite is an interactive process and Birch sees the computer system as a
valuable motivator. 'Anything that's visual helps lower-ability pupils, but
the classes must be small,' he says.
Birch has to keep an eye on fulfilling the National Curriculum checklist of
114 'statements of attainment' (including IT) in his subject. 'This sort of
lesson takes longer, but they are finding the answers for themselves.'
That, says White, is what makes Crystal so valuable. 'It's the interactivity
that punches the message home. In the paper exercise it is easy to write 'it
must be near a railway station'. But the system makes them quantify and
question: how near? . . . It makes them think objectively and a lot more
deeply if they use an expert system, or even better, write their own.'
Writing an expert system is a matter of developing and defining the rules
inherent in decision-making. Crystal provides the framework, or 'shell',
with screen windows and help screens ordering and refining the process.
White believes this has given pupils an understanding of issues - for
instance in another Crystal exercise, the crisis a nomadic tribe might face
if it stays in one area too long.
'It makes them see the consequences more clearly because they decide on the
input,' White says. The teaching of computing is currently in flux, with
current courses being scrapped in September 1993. IT and computer studies
used to be a GCSE, a largely theoretical course. CLAIT, Computer Literacy
and Information Technology is a more practical course, embracing database,
spreadsheets, videotext and desktop publishing.
The new courses are on IT (resembling CLAIT), and Information Systems, a
more broadly based course, of which White approves. 'It's much more tuned to
giving an understanding of IT in business, dealing with the communication
and handling of information.' The new courses will include modelling with
spreadsheets, educational games, measurement and control and applications
and effects of computers in modern society.
It is the job of David Bowles, senior teacher in charge of the curriculum,
IT and technology, to oversee the introduction of the National Curriculum
courses. He has seen the teaching of computing progress from an O-level in
1980 - which involved five weeks of computing history and a remote link to a
mainframe - to the new package-based teaching. 'In the big world outside
people use IT to solve a problem, not for the sake of it. It makes sense to
teach it the same way.'
'Children get blase very quickly about new technologies such as videos.
Computing might go the same way unless we use it wisely, which is to develop
computing as a cross-curricular subject. They learn their IT in geography,
history, English, science and mathematics, almost all subjects. Geoff does
more cross-curricular teaching than anyone else.'
Taking IT for granted is part of modern education. When the pupils go out
armed with Pharos, their confidence at the screen might be as important as
any knowledge about trading in the single market.

No school that I know of restricts pens and pencils solely to the art
department. Sadly, few schools are as enlightened about computers. Many
systems are still the exclusive province of the maths or design &amp; technology
department. Westlands School demonstrates that computers have more general
application. IT is integrated into other subjects as an enabling technology.
Whilst computer programming can be regarded as a discipline, the use of a
computer is far more general. In my opinion, expert systems
have been the most disappointing area of the computer industry in the past
10 years. The theory of rule-based systems is attractive - the computer
makes decisions based on patchy data. To do this, it needs an array of
knowledge extracted from experts in the field and weightings to know what
information is important.
White has been extremely innovative in his use of the various software tools
available. Westlands School has used Crystal well. How transferable this
case is to a typical business scenario is
dubious. Nat West's use of Pharos seems to me to be more of a marketing tool
than a serious business application. Expert system shells such as Crystal
impose a level of discipline. They are useful for identifying what you need
to know to make a decision. Whether they are of value in making that
decision is a matter of conjecture.
One reason often stated for the apparent rarity of expert systems is that
they give such competitive advantage that companies are reluctant to talk
about them. This is disinformation. Expert systems
that deliver real customer benefits have become common knowledge very
rapidly.
The real lesson from Westlands School is that a good manager with vision,
such as White, makes all the difference.
Highlights of this study are:
IT is a tool for all areas of business, not just finance;
Expert systems may be useful for imposing discipline on problem-solving;
Managers with vision make the difference.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour anger as Scott inquiry
awaits Mayhew
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday made its strongest complaint yet that ministers are failing
to give adequate answers to questions about the arms-for-Iraq affair, on the
eve of an appearance at the Scott inquiry by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the
Northern Ireland secretary.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the parliamentary
authorities had blocked his attempts to table a question for ministerial
answer. This was 'particularly objectionable' because the Scott hearings
were taking place in public.
Mr Cook's remarks came at a time of increasing public interest in the
inquiry in the wake of claims on Monday by Sir Hal Miller, an ex-MP and
former Conservative party vice-chairman, that Sir Patrick, then
attorney-general, had tried to dissuade him from giving evidence in support
of a businessman accused of illegally exporting parts for the Supergun.
Sir Hal says this exchange took place between May and November 1990 in the
House of Commons lobby. Charges against the businessman - Mr Peter Mitchell
of Walter Somers, a Midlands engineering company - were dropped in November
1990 following advice from Sir Patrick.
The allegation has given a new lease of life to an issue the government must
have hoped had died away.
But Sir Hal's remarks raised more questions than they answered. And their
impact was softened for many by the fact that he was not prepared to give
evidence to a Commons committee inquiry completed before the last general
election. Others have commented on the lack of precision in what he said.
When exactly did the lobby encounter take place? Did Sir Nicholas Lyell -
the then solicitor-general who has since succeeded Sir Patrick as the senior
law officer - witness the exchange, as parts of Sir Hal's testimony appear
to suggest?
And what did he say to Sir Nicholas in a December 1990 letter referred to in
his evidence in connection with the Matrix Churchill affair? He seems to
have dispatched it after an approach by The Sunday Times. 'I gave them a
great deal of information about Somers which they subsequently threatened to
publish on a number of occasions and may still appear,' Sir Hal said.
It was last year's release of previously classified government documents
during the trial of senior Matrix Churchill management which indicated the
possible involvement of government departments in military-related trade
with Iraq and eventually triggered the Scott inquiry. There is also the
question of what Sir Hal told Treasury ministers in the wake of the Somers
arrests in May 1990, and who were the ministers concerned?
Sir Hal said on Monday that he had raised the question of the powers
available to Customs and sought for them to be circumscribed. But how much
detail about the Somers case did he go into? He said he made the approach
'after all this died down', suggesting there was some delay after the
arrests.
Between May and the shake-up which followed Baroness Thatcher's replacement
as party leader in November, Treasury ministers included Mr John Major, Mr
Norman Lamont and Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip.
Mr Peter Lilley, now social security secretary, was financial secretary to
the Treasury between July 1989 and July 1990. Mrs Gillian Shephard, now
employment secretary, became a Treasury minister in November 1990.
Another question is what did Sir Hal tell Lady Thatcher in two letters in
April 1990? Sir Hal has tried to deflect criticism from the former prime
minister, arguing that she may have at worst been 'badly briefed' on the
issue of exports to Iraq. On Monday he insisted that when he wrote the
letters she did not know about the Supergun.
Yet Sir Hal also told the Scott inquiry that the British intelligence
service knew about the supergun in June 1988.
Sir Patrick will be the first of a number of government members who are
expected to be invited to give evidence to the Scott inquiry, which is
likely to take special note also of evidence provided by intelligence
officers and Customs investigators. Information from intelligence officers
is understood to have been already gleaned in private.
Within the Customs service, there remains a lingering resentment as well as
suspicion about the decision not to take the Supergun affair to court. As an
independent prosecuting authority, British Customs could have proceeded, but
something convinced its senior officials not to, even though investigators
were convinced they had a good case.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government to announce committee of
privy council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government plans within days to announce proposals to set up a committee
of privy councillors to monitor the security services, a Labour MP said
yesterday, writes David Owen. Mr Donald Anderson, the MP for Swansea East,
made the claim while expressing concern the announcement might come during
the Whitsun recess. He was supported by Mr David Winnick, the Labour MP for
Walsall North, who said confining membership of such a body to privy
councillors would be 'a form of apartheid'. Cabinet ministers agreed earlier
this month to proceed with legislation to put MI6, the overseas security
service, on a statutory basis in the next session of parliament. However, it
is understood that plans to increase the accountability to parliament of the
security services have not yet gone to cabinet.

A LORD who followed a tradition of not speaking until he had something to
say made his maiden speech to the House of Lords yesterday - 43 years after
he took up his seat.
'I am pleased to make my somewhat overdue maiden speech in a debate which
affects my locality considerably,' said 64-year-old Lord Trevor, who entered
the Lords in 1950, and who lives near Wrexham, north Wales.
His lordship, the fourth baron in his Welsh lineage, broke his silence in a
debate on proposals for new committees to oversee the police.

MPs travelling to European Community institutions on parliamentary business
will no longer have to pay income tax on the money they receive to meet the

Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary, said yesterday he had tabled

parliamentary travel within the EC is treated on the same basis as UK

POULTRY farmers were cheated out of thousands of pounds in compensation for
chickens they were forced to slaughter during the 1980s salmonella scare, a
committee of MPs said yesterday.
They accused the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food of deliberately
short-changing the farmers in an act of 'maladministration that should never
be repeated'.
The select committee for the parliamentary ombudsman said ministers had set
compensation 'at the lowest levels legally defensible'.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Shadow cabinet elections reformed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REFORMED arrangements for shadow cabinet elections, including tighter
polling procedures and restrictions on the use of proxy votes, were approved
yesterday at the weekly meeting of Labour MPs, Alison Smith writes.
The changes were recommended by a review committee of MPs set up after a
wave of claims and counter-claims about ballot-rigging last June in the
run-up to the annual elections for 18 shadow cabinet members, the chief whip
and party chairman.
One frontbencher had claimed that on occasion the ballot box containing the
votes of Labour MPs had been opened on the night before the poll closed, and
some MPs had argued that if preliminary results could be discovered, it
would be easy for party power-brokers and campaign managers to fix the
outcome with blank papers.
The report makes no mention of these unsubstantiated rumours but simply says
that the election process has been criticised for being 'slow and
cumbersome'.
Despite the impetus for reform - particularly from the new intake of MPs -
there had been some fears that the move would be opposed by the whips. In
the event, however, the report was accepted unanimously by the 80 or so at
the meeting.
Under the new arrangements, which will come into effect for this autumn's
contest, a polling station will be set up in a Commons committee room. No MP
will be allowed to act as proxy for more than one of his or her colleagues.
Immediately after the close of polling, the ballot papers will be counted in
the presence of scrutineers.
The timetable for any further 'run-off' ballots has been shortened and even
if more than one is needed should now be completed within two weeks.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Dispute over EC tax on carbon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday rejected in its strongest terms yet proposals for a
European Community carbon tax.
Sir John Cope, the paymaster-general, said at a stormy Commons committee
meeting that 'the EC carbon tax along the lines proposed does not appear to
be in the UK's interest' and that the UK 'sees no need at this stage to
consider new taxes on energy'.
He added: 'After a year's discussion (between EC member states) it is clear
there is no consensus on a working basis (for the tax), and we should avoid
imposing excessive burdens on industry.'
Ms Clare Short, Labour MP for Birmingham Ladywood, said: 'We have seen a
deeply reactionary step today.' Labour found the EC tax proposals
'interesting, important and worthwhile' although further investigation of
their impact on poor families was needed.
The EC committed itself to curbing carbon dioxide emissions at last year's
Rio summit, but discussions on the tax, its only proposal for meeting the
targets, have been stalled by clashes between the energy policies of member
states.
The UK's resistance to an EC-imposed tax, which emerged in April when it
introduced its own taxes on motor and domestic fuel, has been described as
unhelpful by Commission officials.
Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of
Energy, said: 'This is going to mean an impasse for the EC which the next
presidency will have sort out.'
Mr Simon Roberts, an official of Friends of the Earth, the pressure group,
argued that energy efficiency measures could cut energy use in Britain's
buildings by 25 per cent.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Terrorist detention laws upheld -
European Court of Human Rights rules for the government
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT powers to arrest and detain terrorist suspects do not violate
human rights, the European Court of Human Rights ruled yesterday.
The court said the situation in Northern Ireland justified an exemption for
Britain from a requirement under the European Human Rights Convention that
suspects be brought 'promptly' to court.
Judges voted 22-4 to reject a complaint by two Northern Irishmen who claimed
their human rights were breached when they were arrested and held under the
Prevention of Terrorism Act - one for six days, 14 hours and 30 minutes and
one for four days, six hours and 25 minutes.
The Prevention of Terrorism Act allows the home secretary to detain
terrorist suspects for up to five days without charge.
After being found guilty by the Human Rights Court in 1988 following a
similar case, the government invoked an exemption under a convention
provision which states that in time of war or 'other public emergency
threatening the life of the nation' a government can be exempted from its
obligations 'to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the
situation'. The judges effectively stated that the 'public emergency' in
Northern Ireland was sufficient grounds for the government to take
exceptional measures.
The judges said that in the light of the 'extent and impact' of terrorist
violence in Northern Ireland and elsewhere in the UK there was a 'public
emergency'. After being found guilty of breaching human rights in 1988, the
government either had to introduce new judicial measures or claim an
exemption from its human rights obligations. There was no indication the
exemption was 'other than a genuine response' to the terrorist situation.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont considers corporate tax rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, is looking at the possibility of
increasing taxes as part of his strategy to reduce the public sector
borrowing requirement, expected to be Pounds 50bn this year.
In an interview with The Guardian, Mr Lamont said he intended to address the
tax side of the PSBR gap as well as trying to curb public expenditure. 'I am
worried about the fall in the tax ratio,' he said.
The chancellor said he was particularly concerned about the 'very large
number of companies with unused tax allowances' which shield their profits
from tax.
'One of the questions I am interested in is to what extent our corporation
tax reforms have actually lessened the yield from companies below what we
might have expected.
'I wholly approve of the changes (former chancellor) Nigel Lawson made to
company tax but I am just examining whether the loss revenue is somewhat
greater than what we anticipated.'
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said last night that he would be calling
for a statement from Mr Lamont on public spending and his comments on tax.

remains elusive

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE political landscape of Northern Ireland has long been a bleak,
inhospitable place for new ideas to take root in and flourish.
Like trench warfare, the province's politics has turned into a classic war
of attrition, the winner being the side which holds out the longest,
regardless of the costs.
As ministers from both the British and Irish governments have been quick to
point out, last week's district council elections in the province have done
little to change that landscape. But in the words of Sir Patrick Mayhew, the
Northern Ireland secretary: 'The vast majority voted for dialogue' - a fact
from which he said he drew 'rational hope'.
Indeed, 58 per cent of the electorate voted for the UUP, SDLP and Alliance
parties, the three parties most committed to the so called Anglo-Irish talks
aimed at drawing up a new political structure for the administration of
Northern Ireland to replace direct rule from Westminster.
The uncomfortable fact, however, is that almost a third of the electorate
voted for parties opposed to the talks on the basis on which they are
currently being proposed, with 12.5 per cent voting for Sinn Fein, which
insists on a place at the negotiating table.
A further 17.2 per cent voted for the Democratic Unionists, who made it an
electoral issue not to be involved in talks until the republic amended two
articles of its constitution, thereby dropping its territorial claim to the
province.
To break the logjam the British government is to drop its hitherto neutral
stance, which was to favour no particular outcome to the negotiations, and
is now preparing its own blueprint for the province.
Sir Patrick, though, says he will not bring out this particular football for
it to be kicked around - until all the players from the last round are back
on the field. The preconditions set by the DUP for its own participation
could therefore prevent this proposal from ever seeing the light of day.
Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, is meanwhile continuing a series of talks
with Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, in the hope of eventually
bringing them into the talks process on the basis of an agreed political
strategy. He says his talks with the Sinn Fein president will continue
'until I have explored fully, and presumably until Mr Adams has explored
fully, the possibility of the agreement we are talking about'.
The move has drawn taunts from opponents north and south of the border,
although significantly both governments consider his motives to be sincere.
Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister said this week: 'Mr Hume is
trying to get Sinn Fein away from the path of violence. I wish him every
success in that.' Mr Richard McAuley, a Sinn Fein spokesman, said: 'We want
a consensus agreement in which all sides will have to compromise, and part
of which will be a commitment by the British to disengage.'
Clearly a commitment to disengage is unlikely to form the basis of Sir
Patrick's new blueprint, but the Irish government was yesterday making it
known through selective leaks in Dublin that it is not happy with the Mayhew
plan.
Dublin is now drawing up its own proposals which seek to counter what is
being perceived as an 'imbalance' appearing in the Mayhew blueprint. In the
wake of last week's district council elections therefore, in which the
extremes on both sides emerged strengthened, it appears that the nationalist
and unionist camps may now consolidate to take different, but possibly
converging, tacks.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Political Notebook: Rearranging the deckchairs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON one level Mr John Major cannot win. If he does reshuffle his cabinet
within the next few days his enemies will declare him weak - unable to
resist demands in the media to rearrange the deckchairs. If he does not then
he will be declared, well yes, weak. This time the charge will be that he is
not in command of his own cabinet, more specifically that he is afraid to
sack his chancellor.
Mr Major understands the predicament well. It explains his irritation when
he is pressed on the subject, as he was this week in his interview with the
FT. It explains why the starting point for his non-committal answers is
always that he will decide in his own time, that he will not be pushed.
There are two other factors behind the hesitation. Mr Major is loyal to his
colleagues. It may seem strange in a government in which that particular
trait is at a premium but it is true nonetheless. The prime minister is far
from convinced that Mr Lamont's stewardship of the Treasury has been
perfect. There are background recriminations about the run-up to sterling's
departure from the European exchange rate mechanism. But scapegoats are not
Mr Major's style.
The second strand is grounded in realpolitik. The chancellor still provides
a shield for Mr Major. He absorbs day by day much of the flak that might
otherwise directed at his Downing Street neighbour. He could be a dangerous
enemy on the backbenches.
But senior party managers are now more convinced than ever that Mr Major
cannot afford to let presentation, loyalty or fear of Mr Lamont's reaction
get in the way of a decision.
They put it this way: Mr Major has a single judgement to make: will his
government - and hence his own position as prime minister - be stronger with
a new chancellor? The answer they give is an unequivocal Yes.
Above all else the government must regain the confidence of the electorate
in its competence to manage the economy. Mr Lamont is not the man to do it.
It would be more dangerous politically to keep him than to sack him.
The chancellor will not go quietly. Colleagues say he is ready to fight to
the last ditch for a job he has always wanted. The betting is that he would
not accept another cabinet post. We might expect another of those famously
destructive resignation speeches from the back benches.
That, say the advocates of an early reshuffle, is an argument for sooner
rather than later. The longer the uncertainty continues the more it will
drain Mr Major's authority. The danger point is the autumn - when the
anti-Maastricht fanatics might seek to wound him in a leadership challenge.
A shake-up now would give Mr Major time to regain his balance before the
October party conference. It might - just might  - allow the Conservatives
to hold on to their 23,000-seat majority in the Christchurch by-election.
It is not though quite as simple as that. For Mr Major the choice of a
successor is as important as any decision to remove Mr Lamont.
At first sight Mr Kenneth Clarke is the only choice. Mr Douglas Hurd apart,
he is the strongest member of the cabinet. He has confidence, common sense
and political guts, and whoever delivers the November Budget will need them.
He wins more votes than anyone else among his cabinet colleagues. He is a
pugnacious performer in the Commons.
But his weaknesses are as obvious as his strengths. Charge of the Treasury
would confirm his status as heir apparent. He has eschewed for the moment
any desire to take sterling back into the ERM but he remains the subject of
deep suspicion on the Euro-sceptic right.
That puts Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary into the frame. His
strengths are obvious. He is careful, clear, and calculating. During the
past year he began to punch his weight in the cabinet. He is the choice of
the recalcitrant right. But then the drawbacks: Mr Howard's instincts on
Europe, on public spending, on industrial policy are closer to those of Mr
Lamont than to those of Mr Major. He is not a man with whom the prime
minister shares a late night whisky.
So on to the 'safe' choices: Mr Malcolm Rifkind and Mr MacGregor. Both have
their admirers, the former for his sharp intellect, the latter for a
well-earned reputation as a skilful political operator. Neither would
threaten Mr Major. The prime minister might yet surprise us all and stick
with Mr Lamont.
But if he did it would be against the advice of his closest advisers and
political friends. As one cabinet minister put it last night: nothing could
be more dangerous than the status quo.

MR David Maclean, minister for the environment, reaffirmed in the Commons
yesterday that the government intends to seek new powers to penalise

FT  27 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Welsh language post filled
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Dafydd Elis Thomas, former leader of Plaid Cymru in the Commons, is to
be chairman of the new statutory Welsh Language Board.
This was announced by Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, when moving the
second reading of the Welsh Language bill in the Commons yesterday.
Mr Hunt looked to the bill, already approved by the Lords, to promote the
wider use of the Welsh language which was now enjoying 'something of a
renaissance'.
He said it would provide a flexible and lasting legal framework within which
the Welsh language could prosper and flourish for many generations to come.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tax boost for MPs on EC business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs travelling to European Community institutions on parliamentary business
will no longer have to pay income tax on the money they receive to meet the
cost of such visits.
Mr Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief secretary, said yesterday that he
had tabled a new clause to the finance bill making the concession, which
means that parliamentary travel within the EC is treated on the same basis
as UK Commons-related trips.
Money for expenses is paid under a scheme set up in 1991 to promote greater
interaction between national and EC political institutions. Its introduction
was one of the less prominent aspects of the Maastricht summit.
The Treasury said that it did not expect much revenue to be lost through the
move.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Councils shake-up comes under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Association of District Councils yesterday launched a scathing attack on
the approach the Local Government Commission has taken to the reorganisation
of local government.
The commission has already announced changes to introduce unitary
authorities in the Isle of Wight, Cleveland, Durham and Derbyshire. It has
given cost savings as the basis for its proposals.
But the association said that the commission's emphasis on cost was
misleading and that its methodology for reaching its conclusions had been
hidden.
Mr Malcolm Fletcher, chief executive of Erewash Borough Council, which is to
be abolished under the commission's proposals, attacked the commission's
claim that a large unitary authority for Derbyshire excluding the city of
Derby will save Pounds 34 in council tax.
He said that this finding, produced by consultants Ernst &amp; Young, conflicted
with the council's own advice from consultants, and that the methodology for
the costings had not been published. He said: 'The experience we have had in
Derbyshire so far ranges from disillusioned to disappointed and perhaps an
awful lot of us are disgusted.'
Lady Elizabeth Anson, chairman of the association, also attacked the
commission's figures. She said: 'People speaking in favour of this on the
expectation of a personal reduction in their council tax will be
disappointed. By the time the government has altered its means of
calculating central grant and has altered the grant itself, no such benefit
is likely to be seen by any Derbyshire council tax payer.'
The association also announced its expectations for the next stage of the
commission's review. It believes that Somerset will become one large unitary
authority, but Avon will be split into three authorities, including an
autonomous Bristol council.
North Yorkshire, in a move the association would strongly contest, is to be
split into three large districts. Proposals for all these councils will be
announced by Sir John Banham, chairman of the Commission, next month.
Humberside, which like Cleveland and Avon was first created in the review of
local government under the premiership of Sir Edward Heath, will be split
into five unitary authorities, the association says. Gloucestershire will be
split into three authorities.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Peer ends 43 years of silence in
House
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A LORD who followed a tradition of not speaking until he had something to
say made his maiden speech to the House of Lords yesterday - 43 years after
he took up his seat.
'I am pleased to make my somewhat overdue maiden speech in a debate which
affects my locality considerably,' said 64-year-old Lord Trevor, who entered
the Lords in 1950.
His lordship, the fourth baron in his Welsh lineage, broke his silence in a
debate on proposals for new committees to oversee the police.
He said that the proposed changes were 'drastic' and bad for morale.
Lord Allen of Abbeydale congratulated him on 'breaking the ice', adding: 'I
hope it won't be too long before we hear you again.'
Asked why he had taken so long to speak, Lord Trevor did not waste words: 'I
think the quick, short and truthful answer to that question is that I have
waited for something that affected the locality in which I live.'
Was he a man of few words? 'Most definitely,' the peer declared.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Solicitors renew legal aid challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Law Society, the solicitors' professional body, yesterday launched the
second of two challenges to government changes in the legal aid scheme,
Robert Rice writes.
The society is seeking a judicial review of the decision by Lord Mackay, the
lord chancellor, to cut legal aid eligibility without following proper
consultation procedures with the society.
The cuts, which came into force on April 12, reduce the qualifying
disposable income limit for free legal aid to income support levels and
increase the contributions paid by others towards their cases.
The society says that on the government's figures 37 per cent of households
 -between 12m and 14m adults - will be affected by the cuts.
The government has predicted that the number of legal aid certificates
issued this year will drop from 410,000 to 287,000. That means 30 per cent
of those who should have received legal aid will be deprived of access to
justice, the society says.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Shell to derecognise unions at refinery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHELL will next month derecognise trade unions at its Haven refinery in the
Thames estuary in an effort to introduce sweeping changes in working
practices.
Mr Fred Higgs, the TGWU transport union's national oil industry officer,
yesterday accused oil companies of 'collusion to achieve a union-free
environment'.
Shell says it is imposing the move to cut its operating costs, improve
efficiency and maximise its investments in a depressed but competitive
European refining market.
BP and Esso have already made moves to derecognise unions in parts of their
operations while last year all the main oil companies except Mobil ended
collective bargaining agreements in oil distribution. Mr Higgs said: 'It
fits in with their ideological objectives. Through a mixture of inducements
and intimidation they want workers to accept individual contracts of
employment.'
Shell intends to cut the Haven workforce by 100 posts to 350 by the end of
1994. It believes this will mean compulsory redundancies. It also intends to
push through sweeping changes in working practices for those who remain.
Teamwork will be introduced with the abolition of demarcation lines. All
workers will have their terms of employment, benefits and salary structure
brought into line with staff in the rest of Shell.
Shell also plans individual appraisal of workers to determine pay, career
development and range of work. The company also intends to contract out
canteen and security services and possibly maintenance work as well.
Workers will still be able to remain union members, but all formal
negotiating agreements with the unions are to be scrapped.
Shell argues that traditional collective deals are no longer relevant to the
company's needs because they are a drain on resources and take up too much
of the company's time and effort.
In a confidential briefing document for its managers Shell says it intends
to make the Haven refinery virtually strike-free as well: 'Any industrial
action, including strike action, would require the company to decide whether
or not an individual continues in employment. If the decision is not to
retain employees, then there is no obligation on the company to pay
redundancy or severance money to those who are on strike.'
Mr Higgs said he and the shop stewards at Haven would meet the workforce
next Tuesday to decide how to respond to Shell's leaked plans.

FT  27 MAY 93 / B&amp;Q women in setback on Sunday trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR WOMEN shopworkers who claimed that enforced Sunday closure of a West
Yorkshire branch of B&amp;Q, the DIY chain, amounted to unlawful sex
discrimination, yesterday lost the first round of their legal battle in the
High Court.
Mr Justice Ferris struck out an application for an injunction preventing
Kirklees Borough Council from enforcing the 1950 Shops Act at B&amp;Q's Dewsbury
store. The women and B&amp;Q, which was supporting their application, all said
they would appeal.
B&amp;Q said: 'The staff are willing and wanting to work. The only people who
will lose from this are the customers and the employees.' The judge said
their application - which was opposed by Sir Nicholas Lyell,
attorney-general, as well as Kirklees council - was 'doomed to failure',
having regard to 'the importance of enforcing what appeared to be the law of
the land'.
The women, who all face redundancy if the Dewsbury store is forced to close
on Sundays, were suing Kirklees for lost wages of between Pounds 182 and
Pounds 465 after the enforced closure of the store for 12 weeks in 1991.
They argued that the act amounted to unlawful sex discrimination because a
ban on Sunday working in the retail sector affected women more than men, as
most Sunday-only workers were women.
The judge said the material effect of the Shops Act was that no Sunday
retailing jobs should be made available except for the limited transactions
permitted by the act - not that such jobs might be made available subject to
a discriminatory condition.
Enforcement of the act meant simply that there would be no Sunday jobs for
either men or women.
B&amp;Q said it would not trade at Dewsbury on Sundays after May 31 after the
judge indicated he would grant Kirklees a temporary injunction against
Sunday opening pending the dispute's resolution.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Move to restrict merger accounting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCOPE for companies to boost profits through merger accounting will be
severely reduced under draft guidelines published yesterday by the
Accounting Standards Board.
The guidelines will clamp down on attempts to inflate profits and keep costs
low by using merger accounting when one business acquires another but calls
it a merger.
Merger accounting allows the new company to show the entire year's profits
of the two businesses in the combined accounts, even if the merger took
place on the last day of the financial year.
It also removes the need for revaluation of the acquired company's assets,
which would otherwise increase the depreciation charges in the profit and
loss account.
The practice was widespread until the mid 1980s, when companies attempting
to improve reported profits began to exploit the even greater loopholes
available by arranging pre-acquisition provisions in businesses they bought.
Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the board, said: 'They used to say if you
wanted instant profits you used merger accounting and if you wanted a rising
trend of profits you used acquisition accounting.'
The proposals say merger accounting can be used only if it satisfies five
tests: neither business is described as the acquirer or acquired; all
directors or appointees participate in creating the management structure of
the combined entity; the two businesses are of very different sizes; most
payment should be in equities; and no shareholders maintain an interest in
the future performance of only a part of the combination.
The board also suggests the alternative of abolishing merger accounting.
The board earlier this year issued a discussion document recommending the
abolition of pre-acquisition provisions. Yesterday's move is an attempt to
prevent companies reverting to the exploitation of the existing merger
accounting rules.
'This is slamming an escape route,' said Mr Tweedie. 'There are so very few
genuine mergers. The present standard leaks like a sieve.'
The merger accounting proposals are contained in an exposure draft.
Consultation is open until September 30 and the proposals could be a
standard by the start of next year.

FT  27 MAY 93 / School tests backed by parents in poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST PARENTS want this year's national curriculum tests in England and Wales
to go ahead, according to a poll released yesterday by the Department for
Education.
The poll of 1,000 parents by Bulmershe Research, a division of MAI
Information, contradicts one earlier this month by NOP which found that 52
per cent of parents supported the boycott of the tests by three teachers'
unions, while only 27 per cent opposed it.
The department said its survey had a sample twice as big as NOP's, and was
carried out after the announcement by Mr John Patten, education secretary,
that some of the tests for next year will be abandoned.
The survey found that 75 per cent of parents agreed with simplifying the
tests and restricting them to the basic subjects of English, maths and
science. But 37 per cent were against their children being tested this year.
The National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations, which has a
membership of 10,000 schools, will announce the results of its ballot on
withdrawing children from the tests today.
Mr Patten said the poll showed 'strong support' for this year's tests. He
said 4,295 primary and 1,254 secondary schools had asked for additional
copies of the department's leaflet on the tests.
Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and
Lecturers, which is boycotting the tests, said: 'Parental views will differ
in just the same way that polls move up and down before a general election.
I have some difficulty in accepting that major policy decisions for young
people should effectively be argued out on the basis of competing opinion
poll results.'
Business in the Community yesterday announced that it had enlisted the
support of 77 companies in a new initiative to build links with schools.
Its Aim High campaign intends to improve on previous education-business
partnerships by using national education and training targets to monitor
their impact. It also hopes to encourage children to aim higher in their
careers and qualifications.
Mr Michael Heron, chairman of the Post Office and deputy chairman of
Business in the Community, launched the campaign at a primary school in
King's Cross, London, where volunteers from local businesses are used
extensively in classrooms. He hopes to enlist 500 companies during the next
12 months.
A survey of the 77 companies launching the initiative found that only 20 per
cent measured the effect of their involvement on children, and that less
than half had reviewed their education policy in the light of the national
targets.
Companies were found to provide strong support for work experience and in
providing material for the curriculum. However, almost 80 per cent of the
founder companies provided no support for out-of-school activities and few
helped with programmes involving direct personnel involvement such as
mentoring.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Pounds 290m gas link to Belgium could be completed by 1997
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSTRUCTION of a Pounds 290m gas pipeline linking the UK to Belgium could
start at the end of next year and be completed by 1997, according to
companies which launched the project yesterday.
The steering committee of seven companies studying the feasibility of the
link plans are planning to distribute a prospectus next week. The companies
are trying to gauge market interest in the project in the hope of raising
construction funds.
The 215km pipe would carry 15bn cu m of gas a year to Zeebrugge in Belgium.
It could then be distributed on the European gas grid.
Companies involved in the project, including British Gas, British Petroleum
and Norway's Statoil, are believed to be planning a pool system for using
spare capacity.
Energy companies are expected to be asked to agree 20-year contracts for
sending gas through the pipe. If at any time they do not want to fulfil all
their commitment, they can make spare capacity available in the pipe through
the pool system.
This would be run by a company which is expected to be set up to operate the
pipeline.
Arthur D. Little, the management consultancy group, is co-ordinating
responses to the prospectus and is expected to decide whether to go ahead
with further engineering studies by the third quarter of the year. By that
time companies will have to commit about Pounds 1.5m for the design work.
European gas demand is expected to increase rapidly in the next 20 years.
Some estimates suggest it could rise by as much as 55 per cent from 300bn cu
m per year to 450bn cu m a year.
UK gas would have to compete in that market with gas from Russia, Algeria
and possibly Iran.
But the pipeline could also be used for importing gas into the UK from
Europe.

INDUSTRY broadly welcomed the science and technology white paper yesterday

it.
Especially popular among industrialists were measures intended to improve
the flow of knowledge to smaller companies, the establishment of a
technology foresight programme and the promise of help for projects that are
close to commercial exploitation.
Mr Ken Gray, chief executive of Thorn EMI's central research laboratories,
said: 'For the first time we are going to have science, technology and
engineering organised for one purpose: wealth creation.'
Mr Richard Freeman, chief economist at ICI, said: 'This is a major
opportunity to change the ethos and behaviour within and between
science-based industry and government.'
The Confederation of British Industry welcomed government recognition that
government-supported science and technology should be linked more closely to
industry. 'The country cannot afford elegant science and technology entirely
for its own sake.'
However, Mr Andrew Boswell, technical director of computer company ICL,
warned against trying to direct basic research to industrial ends. He added
that better co-ordination between government, industry and academia must not
mean more paperwork.
The Labour party condemned the white paper as 'a complete failure' and a
'bitter disappointment' to scientists, while welcoming some of its specific
proposals.
Mr Lewis Moonie, the party's science spokesman, said it failed to meet
expectations 'on almost every key issue facing British science and
engineering today'.
He complained that no extra money was to be made available to meet even the
document's 'limited' aspirations.
Mr Moonie said 80 per cent of government research and development spending
was still left outside the Department of Trade and Industry's control.
Mr Don Foster, the Liberal Democrat science spokesman, said the paper
promised much but delivered very little. He said Britain was the only
country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with
the exception of Turkey, where research and development funding as a
proportion of gross domestic product had declined.
Professional bodies were divided. The Institute of Professionals, Managers
and Specialists said it 'threatens every government laboratory with
privatisation'.
But the Engineering Council and the four engineering institutions (chemical,
civil, electrical and mechanical) welcomed the arrival of science and
technology 'at the top of the political agenda'.
Reaction from the academic community was mixed. Dr David Harrison, chairman
of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, welcomed the pledge to
continue dual funding for research. He said: 'We also support the philosophy
that much of government-funded scientific research should underpin wealth
creation. Competitiveness and economic recovery depend on investment in
innovation.'
However, he attacked the failure to set up a humanities funding council,
which he said would have protected funds 'against other claims on university
finances'.
Students and lecturers voiced concern about the proposal that research
councils should make 'fewer awards' for three-year doctorates.
Several industrialists, however, felt the increased emphasis on masters'
degrees would improve science graduates training for industry work.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Britain makes global impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the government last carried out a thorough review of science policy 21
years ago, no-one knew how to transfer a gene from one organism to another
and Clive Sinclair's first electronic calculators were beginning to replace
slide-rules.
Now genetic engineering is the basis of the multi-billion-dollar
biotechnology industry and today's laptop computers outperform a 1972
supercomputer. UK science has played an impressive role in the technical
revolutions of the past two decades - a part far outweighing the country's 5
per cent share of global research spending.
That contribution is most evident in fields such as biomedical and chemical
research. Pharmaceuticals are an outstanding example; one third of the most
successful drugs were discovered in the UK.
But even in areas such as electronics, where the country's industrial
performance has been weaker, researchers continue to contribute. For
example, a breakthrough at Southampton University in 1987 enables light
pulses to travel thousands of miles along fibre-optics without the need for
expensive amplifiers.
One way of comparing the impact of researchers in different countries is
'citation analysis', which shows the frequency with which work is cited by
researchers in publications worldwide.
On this basis, UK science has a disproportionate impact, though there was a
decline from the 1981-85 period, when British researchers earned 23 per cent
more citations than the world average, to 1987-91, when they were 16 per
cent above average.
There is no doubt that UK research creates a vast amount of wealth and
knowledge for the world. The question after the white paper is whether the
'technology foresight' process can harness it more effectively for the UK.
The proposals in the white paper target research funding as the core of the
nation's problems in science. How that will cause British companies to
invest in scientific advance is yet to be demonstrated.
The speed of change over the 21 years is shown by the following advances:
BIOTECHNOLOGY
1972: Genetic engineering not yet invented. Biotechnology consists of
traditional fermentation to produce antibiotics, vaccines - and beer.
1993: Biotec is one of the world's great growth industries.
MEMORY CHIPS
1972: Integrated circuits with a few hundred components on one silicon chip
are beginning to replace circuit boards.
1993: Standard 16 Mbit memory chips contain 30m components and store as much
information as 1,000 printed pages.
SPACE
1972: Enthusiasm for space flights is running high after the successful US
Apollo programme. Men on Mars predicted within 20 years.
1993. Astronauts restricted to low orbit, 300 miles above earth. Emphasis is
on utilitarian space technology: satellites for communication and earth
observation.
ROBOTICS
1972: First crude industrial robots are causing excitement.
1993: Hundreds of thousands of robots are working routinely in factories
worldwide. The novelty now is the medical robot helping to carry out human
surgery.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Science to focus on picking the winners: The white paper is

and teaching in unversities

'TECHNOLOGY foresight' can now take its place alongside tarot cards and
crystal balls as tools for would-be clair-voyants.
It is what the government's white paper on science and technology strategy
says will help make sure British scientists and companies back the right
technologies.
What it means is quite different from 'technology forecasting' - the fashion
of the 1960s and 1970s when academics painted detailed pictures of the
application of yet-to-be-discovered technologies.
Foresight is a much more systematic exercise in influencing the future. The
aim is to pick winners - not in the form of specific projects but as
strategic areas that could produce the greatest economic and social benefit.
The paper proposes a new structure to control research. A new Council for
Science and Technology, with representatives from industry and universities,
will report to Mr William Waldegrave, science minister. The bodies that
award grants for science will be restructured, and their advisory councils
absorbed into the Office of Science and Technology, an existing government
body. A director-general of all research councils will be appointed.
The LINK steering group that organises collaborative efforts between
academics and industry will be strengthened.
The government's new Technology Foresight Programme will be overseen by
Professor William Stewart, the chief scientific adviser. He will set up
panels of experts from industry, universities, finance, consumer research
and government. They will evaluate the fit between what the paper describes,
in yet more jargon, as 'science-push' and 'demand-pull'.
Science-push happens when trends in science match the availability of strong
UK research groups to work in the most promising areas.
Demand-pull occurs when companies in the UK have the ability and desire to
apply the research and market the results.
Where both come together Prof Stewart will foresee an opportunity. All
government decisions on research funding will be assessed in this way, and
Prof Stewart hopes industry will use them for its R&amp;D planning. An indirect
benefit, the paper says, is that 'the networking generated by the exercise
will greatly increase interchange between private, academic and public
sectors'.
There are already a few examples of companies and public bodies engaged in
foresight in the UK, says Mr Ben Martin of the Science Policy Research Unit
at the University of Sussex, who wrote a background report on the subject as
part of the government's preparation for the white paper.
But in other countries foresight is more widespread. 'In Japan and now
Germany and the US, foresight exercises take place within companies, within
industrial associations, within individual government departments or funding
agencies, and spanning all research,' Mr Martin says.
Mr Waldegrave says he is aware of how Japan does things: 'Whenever I go to a
laboratory I see row after row of Japanese names in the visitors' book. They
make a systematic effort to find out what's going on elsewhere in the
world.' He says the recent sharp increase in Japanese government funding of
life sciences research is a direct result of such activity.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Criticism of Civil Service is rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RECOMMENDATION by two top government advisers that 'considerable'
overcapacity and overmanning in Civil Service research establishments should
be reduced by removing them from the control of Whitehall departments is
rejected by the white paper.
In a study on government spending on science and technology published
yesterday, Sir Peter Levene, the prime minister's efficiency adviser, and
Professor William Stewart, government chief scientific adviser, say that
there is potential for 'significant savings' through greater competition for
government research contracts.
The study recommends faster privatisation of government research
establishments. Where research establishments cannot be privatised, their
ownership should be taken away from departments to separate the purchaser
and provider along similar lines to other public services such as health and
the social services.
The white paper accepts that privatisation is a realistic prospect for some
establishments. But it promises only a sector-by-sector review of the
organisational and managerial structures of research establishments which
are not to be privatised - in spite of the study's conclusion that
significant savings would result from greater competition for government
research contracts.
The study says that Civil Service research activities are insufficiently
exposed to competitive tendering because Whitehall departments treat their
research establishments as fixed costs. The result is that the overheads are
excessive - the proportion of administrative staff is 50 per cent higher in
government research establishments than it is in industrial research
establishments.
Most government departments are spending a higher proportion of their
research budget in-house than five years ago, the study says. The Scottish
Office, for example, has increased its in-house spending from 14 per cent in
1986-87 to 19 per cent in 1990-91. The in-house share of the Department of
Trade and Industry has risen from 7.6 per cent to 11.8 per cent over the
same period. This contrasts with the research councils, which have switched
more of their spending to universities and have reduced their staff by 9 per
cent in the same period. The number of civil servants engaged in
non-military research and development is rising - from 7,501 in 1986-87 to a
planned total of 8,633 in 1994-95.
Rationalisation of defence research activities has already led to the
closure of a large number of sites and a reduction in staff of 2,000, the
study says.
A similar approach in other departments could not only increase the amount
of research for the money but also help the research establishments bid more
competitively for other work.
Civil servants involved in science and technology should in future be
employed on fixed-term contracts to improve the flexibility of research
establishments, the study says.
Among the reasons cited by departments for protecting government research
establishments from competition are the need for a quick response when
emergencies arise, for example, in relation to health or safety. However,
the study says that the response of defence companies such as Royal Ordnance
in the Gulf War suggests that this need not be a problem.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Nation lags in R&amp;D spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL compar-isons provide the main support for lobby groups such as
Save British Science, as they argue for the UK to strengthen the voice of
science in government and to spend more on research and development.
Figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the
only reliable source of international statistics, show that the UK fell back
in relation to other industrialised countries during the 1981-91 decade on
almost every measure of spending.
During the 1970s the UK had kept more or less in pace with its international
competitors, in terms of the percentage of gross domestic product devoted to
science. But the 1980s and early 1990s have seen a substantial slide in the
UK position in both government and industrial R&amp;D.
UK public spending on non-military R&amp;D, the area at the heart of the white
paper, fell from 0.72 per cent of GDP in 1981 to 0.49 per cent in 1991. This
resulted especially from cuts in support for near-market research in areas
of relevance to industry, cuts not matched by any other industrialised
country.
Save British Science has been calling unsuccessfully for a government
commitment to raise its civil R&amp;D over five years to 0.8 per cent of GDP,
the level it says is the minimum required to maintain a competitive
international position.
Even the Japanese government, which has until now spent only a relatively
small amount to support the country's huge industrial research effort, is
planning to double its R&amp;D budget from the present 0.5 per cent of GDP.
Japanese industrial leaders see this increased investment in basic science
not as a luxury but as an essential foundation for the country's
competitiveness in the 21st century.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Investor disputes up 50% in year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPLAINTS to the investment ombudsman, who resolves disputes between
investors and members of Imro, the investment management regulator, rose 50
per cent last year.
Mr Richard Youard, the ombudsman, said in his annual report the increase may
have occurred because Imro had given greater publicity to the scheme. The
overall amount paid in compensation following the involvement of the
ombudsman fell to Pounds 40,700 from Pounds 114,000.
Many complaints focused on alleged negligence by advisers. One example cited
was an adviser who failed to inform an 80-year-old woman of what would
happen to her investments when she died.
Claims ranged from Pounds 5 - a demand for interest on cash held within a
personal equity plan - to Pounds 350,000, involving an investor in a hotel
partnership in which the ombudsman felt unable to adjudicate.
The ombudsman said there were some hopeful signs of improvement in the
industry, with documentation getting better.
He added: 'Two years ago, I complained about bad or non-existent factfinds
and of inadequate, if any, contemporaneous notes. Cases this year have
shown, on the whole, satisfactory factfinds and useful contemporaneous
notes.'
But the ombudsman added that investors 'often show unrealistic expectations,
confusion between different types of investment and a general lack of
understanding of how the markets work'.
The investment ombudsman has powers to make individual awards up to a
maximum of Pounds 100,000. The costs of his services are met by a levy on
Imro members.
Details and copies of a free complaints leaflet explaining how to complain
about an Imro member are available from the Office of the Investment
Ombudsman, 6 Frederick's Place, London EC2R 8BT.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Companies sign up for schools link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS IN the Community yesterday announced that it had enlisted the
support of 77 companies in a new initiative to build links with schools.
Its 'Aim High' campaign intends to improve on previous education-business
partnerships by using national education and training targets to monitor
their impact. It also hopes to encourage children to aim higher in their
careers and qualifications.
Mr Michael Heron, chairman of the Post Office and deputy chairman of
Business in the Community, launched the campaign at a primary school in
King's Cross, London, where volunteers from local businesses are used
extensively in classrooms. He said: 'For the first time business is
employing the best of business methods to the pressing needs of education.'
He hopes to enlist 500 companies during the next 12 months.
A survey of the 77 companies launching the initiative found that only 20 per
cent measured the effect of their involvement on children, and that less
than half had reviewed their education policy in the light of the national
targets.
Companies were found to provide strong support for work experience and in
providing material for the curriculum. However, almost 80 per cent of the
founder companies provided no support for parents, or for out-of-school
activities, and few helped with programmes involving direct personnel
involvement such as mentoring.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, and another leader of the 'Aim High' initiative, said the teaching
profession welcomed the move. He also called for greater emphasis on primary
schools, which - according to the survey - receive only a third as much
business support as secondary schools.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Swan Hunter wins frigate contract extension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINISTRY of Defence has agreed that work on three Type 23 frigates can
continue for a further two weeks at Tyneside shipbuilder Swan Hunter,
receivers Price Waterhouse confirmed yesterday.
Mr Ed James, head of the receivers' team at Swans, said oral agreement had
been reached with the MoD for outfitting on the three frigates to continue
until June 11.
'We have an agreement in principle for a further two weeks,' he said.
Details of prices for the fortnight's work are still being concluded.
Written agreement is expected by tomorrow when the current deal between the
receivers and the MoD on the frigates' outfitting expires.
News of the extension provides a lifeline for the company, which is fighting
to retain a core workforce, secure further orders and strengthen its chances
of being sold as a going concern.
Local hopes of longer survival were boosted later by a meeting between
council leaders and Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister. Mr Brian Flood,
leader of North Tyneside council said afterwards that Mr Sainsbury had said
that, subject to agreement with the defence ministry, Swan Hunter was the
'preferred finisher' of the work on the frigates.
Today the yard's 2,200 employees and 280 contract workers will learn the
names of the 420 being made redundant tomorrow. Mr James confirmed that the
outfitting extension would sustain the remainder for at least the next two
weeks.
Another tentative boost to Swans survival chances came yesterday with news
that the government, in a softening of its stance on Swan Hunter, had asked
the European Commission to reconsider the non-eligibility of UK warship
yards for the Shipbuilding Intervention Fund, a 9 per cent subsidy for
merchant shipbuilding orders. At present UK warship yards receive only 2 per
cent Shipbuilders' Relief.
The receivers hope during the coming fortnight to reach long-term agreement
for completion of the frigates. 'We remain very optimistic the vessels can
be completed on Tyneside,' said Mr James. Temporary agreements had been
needed, he said, because of the complexity of pricing the work.
Announcing the Intervention Funding move during his visit to Tyneside, Mr
Sainsbury said he had written to Mr Karel van Miert, the EC commissioner for
competition and state aid. He said: 'I have asked my officials to open
immediate discussions with commission officials, drawing particular
attention to the problems facing Tyneside.'
UK warship yards returned to private ownership in the mid 1980s under an EC
agreement which wrote off heavy debts in exchange for non-eligibility for
SIF. Since then the government has twice, unsuccessfully, asked the EC to
reconsider, both times for Birkenhead-based Cammell Laird, now about to
close.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Lifeboat launched amid liquidity storm / A look at why the
Bank of England paid a heavy price to rescue a number of banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the summer of 1991 the normal calm of the Bank of England's majestic
Parlours, where its governor and directors have their offices, was
disturbed.
Mr Brian Quinn, director in charge of banking supervision, had become
concerned that there was a threat to the stability of the UK banking system.
He did not believe that the unprecedented loan losses being suffered by the
UK's big clearing banks would put them at risk of failing, but he was less
sure about their smaller brethren.
The Bank was in a dilemma. It is a cornerstone of UK supervision policy that
banks which behave imprudently should be allowed to fail. The theory is that
without this discipline, banks' managers would tend to take excessive risks.
But there are exceptions to this rule. The Bank is prepared to act as a
lender of last resort to prop up an ailing bank if it believes there could
be a threat to the financial system which would have serious economic
consequences.
In July 1991, after the Bank closed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, the corrupt international bank, a number of big banks,
financial institutions and local authorities began to withdraw wholesale
deposits from small and medium-sized banks.
This created a liquidity problem for these banks. They did not have enough
cash to meet their short-term needs, but at this stage they did not appear
to be insolvent. However, if confidence in an institution collapses, a
liquidity problem can soon become a crisis if there is a run on the bank.
The London interbank market was receiving only the faintest hints about the
scale of the problem. But Mr Quinn and his colleagues in the supervision
department were convinced that it was acute, since financial institutions
and professional lenders were visiting him daily to tell him that they were
withdrawing their funds from smaller banks.
The most vulnerable of the smaller banks were those with an exposure to the
property market, since commercial and residential property prices were
plummeting.
The Bank estimated that 40 banks were at risk. It talked to the Treasury and
decided to intervene.
It believed that the collapse of a series of small banks could shake
confidence in the UK financial system and big international banks might
start to withdraw deposits from UK clearing banks - and that could pose a
real threat to the system.
So the Bank decided to risk several hundred million pounds of its capital.
Because it felt able to cope with this level of risk it did not receive any
guarantee from the government.
It did not make loans directly to the ailing banks. It provided indemnities
to the UK's big clearing banks, which provided credit lines to the affected
institutions.
A handful of small banks received these Bank-guaranteed loans, which ran to
several hundred million pounds but considerably less than a billion pounds.
City Merchant Banks, part of fund management group Invesco MIM, and National
Home Loans, a mortgage provider, are both believed to have been
beneficiaries.
But the Bank had made one miscalculation. What had started as a liquidity
crisis for some banks escalated into a solvency problem.
As the recession continued, borrowers from these banks ran into difficulties
and loan losses increased, wiping out their equity. During 1992, the Bank
withdrew authorisation to take deposits from three banks and placed
restrictions on 12 banks.
As a result, the Bank became aware that it faced losses on its financial
lifeboat, which it quantified as Pounds 25m in 1991 and Pounds 90m last
year. It believes the price was worth paying.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Court allows closure of 10 pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL'S plans to sell 20 mines to the private sector were advanced
yesterday when the High Court ruled that the corporation could proceed with
the shutdown of the first 10 pits in its programme.
Two High Court judges ruled British Coal could legally shut the 10 pits
since the corporation had complied with the court's conditions on
consultation with mining unions. The conditions were imposed last December
when the programme was declared illegal.
Lord Justice Glidewell said British Coal had tried to seek agreement with
the unions on the form of consultation. The independent element of scrutiny
demanded by the court last December had been provided by Boyds, the mining
consultants, who had reported on the economic viability of the 10 pits.
He rejected claims by the National Union of Mineworkers that the
consultations had been neither independent nor impartial.
British Coal welcomed the judgment.
The pits covered by the judgment are Cotgrave, Silverhill, Grimethorpe,
Houghton Main, Markham, Trentham, Parkside, Betws, Taff Merthyr and Vane
Tempest.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Drop in advert revenue reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TELEVISION and newspaper advertising dipped in the final quarter of last
year but it is predicted to rally this year, a report published yesterday by
the Advertising Association says.
Revenue from press advertising in the final three months of last year was
6.4 per cent lower than during the same period the previous year when
adjusted for inflation. The final quarter figure was also down on the year's
previous quarters, which had each seen average falls of 2 per cent measured
year on year.
Television advertising revenue fell by 4.8 per cent in the last quarter of
1992.
The Advertising Association says television advertising will now lead the
sector out of its decline, and predicts that as the economy comes out of
recession overall advertising revenues will grow by 2 per cent in real terms
this year, and by 6 per cent next year.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Actuaries rap OFT disclosure plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE professional bodies for actuaries have criticised the Office of Fair
Trading's proposals for disclosure of life insurance charges.
The English Institute of Actuaries and the Scottish Faculty of Actuaries,
many of whose members are employed by life companies, said a requirement for
prospective customers to be told the value of their policy if they surrender
early could be too easily misunderstood.
They also urged the OFT to continue to allow companies to show prospective
customers charges based on the industry average, rather than on their own
costs. However, they urged that a company's own charges be shown in a
different form.
The actuaries' criticisms of the proposals are in line with those from the
life insurance industry.
In March, the OFT ruled that proposed disclosure rules for the sale of life
insurance tell consumers too little about the costs of each product for them
to make wise choices, and thus restricted genuine competition in the
industry.
Consumer groups and some regulators have said that the lack of cost
disclosure has led to excessive 'mis-selling' because consumers do not
understand the products they buy. Too often, they cancel policies in the
first few years, when company charges absorb nearly all the premiums paid.
Mr Chris Hairs, chief actuary at life insurers Legal and General and deputy
chairman of the institute's life assurance joint committee, said: 'We agree
with the concerns stated in the OFT reports.'

FT  27 MAY 93 / BBC faces new efficiency test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC is to face another government check on its efficiency before its
licence fee is set for next year.
The government plans in the next few weeks to put out to tender a review by
consultants. The aim is to produce a report by the end of the summer
parliamentary recess.
The findings will be used to help set the BBC's licence fee in the last
three years of its Royal Charter, which runs out at the end of 1996.
Three years ago Price Waterhouse was selected to examine the efficiency of
the BBC as part of the process of setting the existing licence fee.
The government decided then that the corporation should have one year when
the licence fee would be linked to the retail prices index minus 3 per cent.
This was followed last year and this year by a fee which rose in line with
the index.
At a reception held by the Commons media committee on Tuesday evening, Mr
Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, made it clear the lience fee
would continue to the end of the charter period.
But he emphasised that the government would be looking for evidence of
increasing BBC efficiency and it would like to keep the fee as low as
possible.
At the time of the Price Waterhouse study the government said it intended to
return to the issue to see what progress had been made.
The move will put further strains on the BBC which is trying to modernise
its operations.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Investment managers angry over SIB training proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ANGRY response by many members of Imro, the investment managers'
regulatory body, to 'unworkable' proposals for training and competence has
surfaced in a special circular from the Institutional Fund Managers'
Association (Ifma), which represents almost all the top City investment
houses.
It amounts to the first challenge from the investment industry to the plans
announced this week by the Securities and Investments Board, the top
investor protection agency, to crack down on allegedly slack regulation by
junior bodies such as Imro.
'Considerable concern has been expressed to us by our members about the new
proposals,' says Ifma. 'Some members doubt that the proposals are even
workable.'
Ifma has requested a joint meeting with Imro and SIB to press for changes.
The uproar relates to the consultation document on training and competence
arrangements for Imro members issued last month. Ifma members have been
especially concerned about measures added since an Imro working party in
April 1992 recommended a flexible training and competence code.
In his report to the Treasury this week, Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, said
one of SIB's most important tasks was the setting of standards for investor
protection, including standards of training and competence.
But Ifma says the new draft requirements go beyond sensible minimum
standards.

FT  27 MAY 93 / British Coal allowed to close 10 pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL'S plans to sell off 20 mines to the private sector were
advanced yesterday when the High Court ruled the corporation could go ahead
with the shutdown of the first 10 pits in its programme.
Two High Court judges ruled British Coal could legally shut the 10 pits
since the corporation had complied with the court's conditions on
consultation with mining unions. The conditions were imposed last December
when the programme was declared illegal.
Lord Justice Glidewell said British Coal had tried to seek agreement with
the unions on the form of consultation. The independent element of scrutiny
demanded by the court last December had been provided by Boyds, the mining
consultants, who had reported on the economic viability of the 10 pits.
He rejected claims by the National Union of Mineworkers that the
consultations had been neither independent nor impartial. He said the union
had either misunderstood the conditions demanded by the court or attempted
to drag out proceedings in the hope this would benefit its members.
British Coal welcomed the judgment and reasserted its intention to go ahead
with the closures and offer 20 pits to private buyers. 'The fabric of the
mines will be preserved while we assess the prospects for disposal to the
private sector in keeping with our commitment which was reflected in the
recent government white paper,' it said. British Coal has received about 20
approaches from companies interested in bidding for some of the pits.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Report on Thorp is passed to Howard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pollution Inspectorate has passed its report on the public consultation
into British Nuclear Fuels' controversial Thorp reprocessing plant at
Sellafield to Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary.
Mr Howard is expected to take at least several weeks to review the 200-page
report on the 80,000 public responses, which was sent to the Department of
the Environment on Friday.
Department officials will meet to decide how to proceed within days. One
option is to decide the plant's future simply on the basis of the report.
The department, however, has received legal advice that it may need to
consider the wider economic and social case for Thorp to guard against legal
action by pressure groups. It is understood that the department has received
informal indications that further consultation might be advisable.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Dealing practices on shares defended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRITICISMS OF limits on the transparency of stock market dealings are
unfounded or redundant, says the chief economist of the London Stock
Exchange.
Mr Stephen Wells, writing in the spring issue of the Stock Exchange
Quarterly, published yesterday, addresses the questions of whether and when
details of stock trades should be published.
Details of large trades are at present published after a 90-minute delay.
Discussions about changing the rules are under way between the
market-makers, the exchange and the regulators, with a compromise
announcement expected early next month. The compromise is thought to involve
a greater delay in the publication of very large trades.
Mr Wells argues that for very large trades 'the current 90-minute delay
before publication is often insufficient'. For the normal
institutional-sized trade, he says, there is a case for limited transparency
in a market, like London's, in which marketmakers quote firm two-way prices.
'Unless marketmakers are able to maintain some form of temporary information
advantage by delaying publication they will be picked off by astute
institutional investors.'
Mr Wells concludes: 'The undoubted strength of London's markets is the
commitment to provide liquidity. This commitment could not continue if the
positions of market-makers were effectively on display - which is what total
transparency means . . . Markets which fail to meet the needs of users will
lose business to markets that do.'
Nearly half the shares traded on the London Stock Exchange in the first
three months of 1993 were from overseas, according to figures released by
the exchange yesterday.
Turnover in international equities rose 34 per cent to a record level of
Pounds 116bn in the first quarter. This compared with Pounds 138bn - up 18
per cent - for English and Irish equities. International equities made up 46
per cent of total equity turnover. Gilt turnover was also up sharply, rising
24 per cent to Pounds 395bn.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Ferry company may be sold off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to study the possible privatisation of Caledonian
MacBrayne, the state-owned ferry company which provides services to islands
off the west coast of Scotland.
The idea of privatising Caledonian MacBrayne, which enjoys an annual
government subsidy of about Pounds 7m, is likely to be an emotive one. It
has already caused protests from Labour and Scottish National party MPs, and
will worry some Conservatives.
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, said the Scottish Office would seek
consultants to review the organisation and structure of the company
'including the possible scope for introducing private- sector participation
in the provision of Caledonian MacBrayne's services'.
The government would consider both public ownership and privatisation. In
the case of privatisation, Mr Lang said in a written parliamentary answer,
it would investigate the scope for 'greater employee involvement', a hint at
the possibility of management buy-outs.
Mr Lang said the government was committed to giving continued financial
support to 'lifeline shipping services.' He saw 'greater efficiency and
effectiveness in subsidy and service provision as leading to better services
for the consumer'.
Caledonian MacBrayne operates ferry services to the inner and outer Hebrides
and in the Clyde estuary, and employs 830 people.
The Scottish Office last looked at the possible privatisation of it in 1988.
It is thought to have approached at least two shipping groups in an attempt
to sell the company but was told that it would be impossible to make many of
the routes profitable.
Since then the company's efficiency has improved and traffic has increased.
Opposition parties argue that privatisation would lead to higher fares and
fewer sailings.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Investment decline likely in October, IFS warns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FALL in business investment is likely later this year and this may hold up
any recovery, researchers from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an
independent think tank, warned yesterday.
The researchers also said that changes to corporation tax between 1984 and
1986 produced a fiscal bias against investment equivalent to the effect of
interest rates being higher by up to 2 percentage points.
The reduction in capital spending from this October expected by Professor
Michael Devereux, Mr Kevin Denny and Mr Stephen Bond is linked to the ending
in that month of the Treasury's temporary increase in tax allowances for
investments.
This was introduced in the Autumn Statement last November in an effort to
boost company activity and stimulate an upturn.
But because of the characteristics of the UK tax system, the increase in
relief on plant and buildings from 25 per cent to 40 per cent will have
little overall impact, the researchers said.
They calculated that the move would have pushed up capital spending this
year by 6 per cent. But once the extra relief ends, investment in the three
years from 1994 will be about 0.5 per cent lower.
The changes to corporation tax in the mid 1980s went too far in scaling back
investment reliefs, the researchers said.
They believed the government should reform the system by giving businesses
tax relief on the cash they raised for investment through equity finance.
That might be introduced in this November's Budget, the first of a new
unified series of Budgets taking in spending as well as taxation.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Free use of roads no longer feasible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S MOTORISTS have had it too good, too long: sooner or later, they
are going to have to start paying for the dubious pleasure of driving up and
down the country's motorways.
That was the main message from the green paper on motorway charges published
yesterday. But alongside that well-trailed prediction came a surprise: the
suggestion that charges could be the first step towards the privatisation of
the motorway network, probably through a franchising process similar to that
being adopted for the railways.
The green paper starts with the proposition that the public purse is not
deep enough to build the new road capacity needed to accommodate likely
traffic growth. So if Britain is not to face the damage to its economy that
will result from worsening traffic congestion, it must tap new sources of
funds.
The government acknowledges that motorists already pay more in taxes than is
spent on the roads. However, it refuses to acknowledge a link between the
two, just as it refuses to acknowledge a link between the amount collected
in tobacco tax and the amount spent on smokers.
It suggests raising more money from motorists by introducing direct charges
for the use of the road network, saying this would have the added benefit of
encouraging people to think about whether journeys were necessary.
The government says it is not practical to introduce charges right across
the road network. So instead it focuses on the options for charging for
motorways, which account for more than half the cost of the Pounds 23bn
national roads programme. The options are:
Motorway permits. These could be bought from post offices or petrol stations
and would be stuck on the windscreen. They could be valid for a year for
regular users or shorter periods for occasional users or visitors.
Electronic tolling. Each vehicle would be fitted with an electronic tag
which would react to signals as the vehicle passed roadside beacons. Charges
would either be clocked up on a central computer and charged to the user's
account, or deducted from a pre-paid smartcard inserted into a device inside
the vehicle.
The green paper suggests that even fairly modest charges would raise
substantial amounts of money. A toll of 1.5p a mile for cars and 4.5p for
lorries (in other words, costing car drivers just Pounds 1.50 for the
100-mile motorway trip from London to Birmingham) would raise Pounds 700m a
year - adding more than 40 per cent to the the Pounds 1.7bn a year currently
being spent on motorway and trunk roads.
One advantage of the charging system over other forms of motoring taxation
is that it would apply selectively. Research carried out for the Department
of Transport shows that fewer than 50 per cent of drivers use motorways
regularly so many motorists would be unaffected by the move. Those who were
affected might take consolation from a commitment in the green paper - no
doubt hard won from the Treasury - that the proceeds from the charges would
be devoted solely to the construction and operation of the charged network.
But what of the drawbacks? The green paper plays down one of the more
obvious ones - the danger that motorway users might switch to unsuitable
roads to save money. Computer modelling carried out by the Department of
Transport, it says, indicates that the highest expected toll - 1.5p a mile
for cars and 4.5p a mile for lorries - would divert only 10 per cent of
vehicle mileage at peak hours.
The other main drawback is that electronic tolling, greatly preferred by the
Department of Transport, is at least five years away because the necessary
technology is not yet ready. That means that if anything is going to happen
in the interim, it will have to be the relatively primitive windscreen
sticker system - and even that will require primary legislation.
Whatever system of charging is introduced, the department sees acceptance of
the idea as an importance step towards another of its key objectives:
getting the private sector involved.
Once a stream of revenue starts pouring in, remuneration of the private
sector for providing parts of the road network can start.
Significantly, the green paper seems largely to dismiss earlier notions that
a network of privately operated toll roads could spring up. In most cases,
these are not viable, it concedes.
Instead, it suggests stripping responsibility for the motorway network from
the Department of Transport and giving it to a new, self-financing public
corporation. This organisation would receive all motorway charges and use
them to operate and expand the motorway network.
Private-sector companies would still build and operate parts of the motorway
network, but they would not charge tolls: the public corporation would use
the road charge revenues to pay the companies' fees according to the number
of vehicles their motorways carried.
More ambitious still is the idea that franchises might be awarded for
geographical sections of the country - say, London to Birmingham - and allow
franchisees to take responsibility for all motorway provision in the area.
The franchises would specify the level of service to be provided, partly in
terms of congestion measurements, and the franchisees would then draw up
their own plans for responding to increased demand - for example, widening
the existing motorway or building a new one. In this case, tolls would be
levied directly by franchisees, who would fund new construction out of
revenues from existing roads.
The idea is sketched out in only the flimsiest detail, leaving many
questions unanswered. But perhaps the most important ones may turn out to be
political rather than technical - not least, whether the country is in a
mood for such radical thinking so soon after the furore of the British Rail
privatisation.

FT  27 MAY 93 / VW seeks big sales expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VOLKSWAGEN group, the largest European carmaker, aims to increase the
market share of its VW and Audi makes in the UK market for new cars by about
50 per cent during the next five years, Kevin Done writes.
Volkswagen acquired VAG (United Kingdom), the British distributor of
Volkswagen and Audi vehicles, from Lonrho, the UK-based international
trading group, for Pounds 124m at the end of last year.
Following the takeover the German carmaker wants to expand substantially its
presence in Britain, which has traditionally been one of its weakest markets
in Europe. Together the VW and Audi makes captured about 14.7 per cent of
west European new car sales last year, but held a share of only 5.2 per cent
in the UK.
The company has set a target of capturing 7.5 per cent of UK new-car sales
by 1998.
VW will change its traditional premium pricing in the UK and be seeking
higher fleet and company car sales.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Complaints to Ombudsman rose by 50 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPLAINTS to the investment ombudsman, who resolves disputes between
investors and members of Imro, the investment management regulator, rose 50
per cent last year, Philip Coggan writes.
Mr Richard Youard, the ombudsman, said in his annual report that the total
may have risen because Imro had given greater publicity to the scheme. The
overall amount paid in compensation following the involvement of the
ombudsman fell to Pounds 40,700 from Pounds 114,000. Many complaints focused
on alleged negligence by advisers. One example cited was an adviser who
failed to inform an 80-year-old woman of what would happen to her
investments when she died.
Claims ranged from Pounds 5 - a demand for interest on cash held within a
personal equity plan - to Pounds 350,000, involving an investor in a hotel
partnership in which the ombudsman felt unable to adjudicate. The ombudsman
said there were some hopeful signs of improvement in the industry, with
documentation getting better.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Nissan halts recruiting as sales fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN, the Japanese car manufacturer, has frozen recruitment at its car
plant in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, and is not retaining temporary contract
workers because of the fall in European car sales - 18 per cent down in the
first four months of this year.
But the company yesterday stressed that Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK and
its managing director Mr Ian Gibson were committed to ensuring there were no
redundancies at the plant. 'He (Mr Gibson) will fall on his sword before
that happens,' the company said.
The plant, widely regarded as one of the country's manufacturing success
stories and until recently apparently recession-proof, employs 4,600. If the
non-recruitment policy were sustained for 12 months there would be a drop of
about 230 employees, because the plant has about 5 per cent annual natural
wastage.
Job vacancies are being filled internally, though any highly specialist
posts may have to be advertised outside.
The plant has taken on temporary workers during surges in demand. Many of
these have been made permanent at the end of their contracts. But a month
ago the company decided to end this practice, affecting 51 temporary
employees. 'We accept there are some people out there who are very
disappointed that the temporary contract didn't turn into a permanent
contract,' said the company.
Mr Davey Hall, Tyne district secretary for the AEEU engineering union, which
has sole union status at Nissan, said last night: 'We are very perturbed at
the news in seeing the flagship of the north-east shrinking its workforce,
which will inevitably have a knock-on effect on its supply companies and our
union membership.'
The company is maintaining its plans to increase its overall UK output this
year by 51 per cent to 270,000 cars, from 179,000 in 1992.
But it has reduced planned 1993 production of the Primera from 130,000 to
110,000, and stepped up output of the Micra by 20,000 to compensate.

LIQUIDATORS to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International have
refused to intervene in an alleged conflict of interest on the part of a
candidate for election to the BCCI creditors' committee at Wembley Arena
today.
The BCCI Isle of Man depositors' protection association wrote to object to
the candidature of a member of the island's Financial Supervision
Commission. It is concerned that the commission does not fairly represent
the individual depositors, and that it would create a conflict of interest
if they decided they needed to sue the regulators.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Benefits of water sell-off questioned
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE economic benefits of water privatisation may have been overstated, says
a paper published today by the Institute for Fiscal Studies.
The paper, by Mr Ted Lynk of the University of Swansea, argues that the
industry in England and Wales may have lost some efficiency when
water-quality monitoring was transferred to the National Rivers Authority.
Comparing efficiency in the 10 large water and sewerage authorities before
they were privatised in 1989 with that in the smaller, privately owned
statutory companies, the paper says: 'The average levels of inefficiency,
relative to potential efficiency, were lowest in the public sector.'

FT  27 MAY 93 / Tory MPs voice concern over fees for drivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY MPs expressed concern that motorists should not be penalised unfairly
under the proposals for road charging unveiled yesterday by Mr John
MacGregor, transport secretary.
But there was some enthusiasm for the increased investment in roads that
could be attracted by privatising Britain's motorways.
As the Commons battle over British Rail privatisation subsided, the
transport secretary was warned by Tory MPs that road charges should at least
be balanced by changes in the tax burden on motorists.
For many Conservatives the expected impact of the BR sale on rail fares and
the possible consequences on the welfare state of the government's spending
review have already created enough fears in the minds of voters.
Mr Iain Duncan-Smith, Tory MP for Chingford, said: 'There is nothing wrong
with the principle of privatisation for certain roads and the concept has to
be explored, but I think that it ought to be part of a general review of the
way that we tax and spend on transport.'
Mr Stephen Day, Conservative MP for Cheadle, said: 'It is right that these
matters should be raised because we have got to look at how we can bring
more money into road investment, but I'd be extremely cautious about any
early decisions being made on this.'
Mr Day defied the government and voted on Tuesday for BR to be allowed to
bid for franchises. But some MPs such as Mr Hugh Dykes, the Conservative MP
for Harrow East who feared that the break-up of BR would hit investment in
the rail network, indicated that they might support the transfer of
motorways to the private sector - precisely because it could encourage more
investment.
Mr MacGregor's stress on the longer term seemed wise. Even if privatisation
is widely supported in Tory ranks, there is little appetite for
controversial legislation in the immediate future as the party seeks to
listen more to voters' concerns.
There is also suspicion that this was was part of government attempts to
boost Treasury revenues without putting up taxes. 'People would jib at
handing over to private companies existing motorways unless they were
satisfied that the tolls were going to be used to improve roads,' said Mr
John Butterfill, Conservative MP for Bournemouth West.
Mr John Prescott, Labour's transport spokesman, said that Britain's
transport infrastructure was 'being sacrificed to a dogmatic obsession with
privatisation'. The only benefit of road pricing and road privatisation
would be to the Treasury. But, while Labour opposes the franchising of
motorways, the party has floated the idea of urban road pricing to ease
congestion.

THE TREASURY yesterday announced two measures to make it easier to attract
private investment for public infrastructure and services.
It has published guidance notes making it easier for public-sector bodies to
lease goods and services from the private sector other than for property and
roads. Leases covered by the guidance will be subject to a value-for-money
test.
There will also be proposals to help offset the cost to private investors of
developing schemes which then go to open competition.

Since privatisation, the public companies have cut costs and staff levels
considerably and improved efficiency further. Ofwat, the regulator, has said
it will take efficiency into account in next year's review.
The institute says geography 'is an important determinant of operating
costs' as flat regions have much higher pumping costs than hilly ones.

FT  27 MAY 93 / BAe settles Pounds 57.6m 'sweeteners' bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace yesterday paid Pounds 57.6m to the UK government to settle
the long-running case over the 'state sweeteners' it received when it
acquired the Rover car group in 1988.
In March, the European Commission ordered the government to recover Pounds
44.4m from the company after it had ruled that the benefits that BAe had
received from the government constituted illegal state aid. BAe has paid
Pounds 57.6m - Pounds 11m for the aid it received and Pounds 46.6m in
interest.
By recovering the tax relief which would have been available on the interest
payments, BAe expects to reduce the net cost of the settlement by Pounds
15.4m to Pounds 42.2m.
The government has agreed to deposit the Pounds 15.4m in special accounts
until the tax position is clarified.
BAe said yesterday that the Pounds 42.2m net cost of the repayment will be
added to the original Pounds 150m purchase price for Rover - increasing the
total cost of the acquisition to Pounds 192.2m.
But the settlement is not expected to affect current-year profits because
the cost will be charged against the acquisition reserve created at the time
of the deal.
The issue was first raised in 1990 by Sir Leon Brittan, then EC competition
commissioner, but became entangled in long procedural wrangles before the
European Court of Justice.
The company welcomed the conclusion of the 'sweeteners' saga. 'It was most
encouraging to see the manner in which the Department of Trade and Industry
worked to ensure that the basis for final settlement met the EC requirement
fairly,' said Mr Richard Lapthorne, finance director of BAe.

FT  27 MAY 93 / VW seeks 50% rise in market share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Volkswagen group, the largest European carmaker, aims to increase the
market share of its VW and Audi makes in the UK market for new cars by about
50 per cent during the next five years.
Volkswagen acquired VAG (United Kingdom), the British distributor of
Volkswagen and Audi vehicles, from Lonrho, the UK-based international
trading group, for Pounds 124m at the end of last year.
Following the takeover the German carmaker wants to expand substantially its
presence in Britain, which has traditionally been one of its weakest markets
in Europe. Together the VW and Audi makes captured about 14.7 per cent of
west European new car sales last year, but held a share of only 5.2 per cent
in the UK.
Mr Detlef Wittig, sales director for the VW brand worldwide and the recently
appointed chairman of VAG (United Kingdom), said the company had set a
target of capturing 7.5 per cent of UK new-car sales by 1998.
The target announced by Mr Wittig is a significant retreat, however, from
the much more aggressive UK expansion outlined by Mr Daniel Goeudevert,
deputy chairman of the Volkswagen group and chairman of the VW volume car
division, in March.
Mr Goeudevert announced that the group was seeking to double the VW/Audi
share in the UK to more than 11 per cent by the late 1990s. He has been
forced to reduce the group's ambitions in the face of VW's financial
difficulties and the growing level of competition in the UK.
In the drive for a higher British sales volume it is being forced to modify
its traditional premium pricing in the UK and to seek higher fleet and
company car sales.
The VW group plans to increase the separation of the retail sales operations
of the VW and Audi brands in the UK. It aims to increase the number of
dealers selling only the VW make from 100 to 130, while reducing the number
of joint VW/Audi dealers to 190 from 220 at present.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Farmers 'cheated' in egg scare payout
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
POULTRY farmers were cheated out of thousands of pounds in compensation for
chickens they were forced to slaughter during the 1980s salmonella scare, a
committee of MPs said yesterday.
They accused the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food of deliberately
short-changing the farmers in an act of 'maladministration that should never
be repeated'.
The select committee for the parliamentary ombudsman said ministers had set
compensation 'at the lowest levels legally defensible'.
After comments in 1988 by Mrs Edwina Currie, then a junior health minister,
that most UK egg production was 'infected with salmonella', egg sales
collapsed and the government introduced a compulsory slaughter scheme for
infected flocks, with compensation.
The ministry decided that only 60 per cent of the birds' value should be
paid in compensation. Poultry farmers were given 14 days to challenge the
level of compensation, but many could not afford to delay payment.

FT  27 MAY 93 / CBI calls for infrastructure agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT should establish a separate agency to promote joint
infrastructure investment ventures between the public and private sectors,
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said yesterday.
Mr Davies, speaking at a CBI conference, said that the Treasury did not have
'sufficient firepower to overcome inertia, resistance, even obstructionism
in the rest of Whitehall and elsewhere in the public sector'.
Private sector involvement in investments traditionally financed by the
public sector required a degree of partnership between government and
industry 'which has been all too rare in the UK'.
He said investors would need to be clear about the rules under which joint
ventures would be approved, particularly what financial contributions the
government might be prepared to make in order to take account of wider
social and economic benefits arising from a development.
They would also need assurances on planning and political risks which could
change the commercial nature of a project. Speeding up the planning process
would increase the attractiveness of projects for the private sector.
'Intellectual property rights need to be better protected so that companies
which bring forward innovative projects to government do not fear losing
their investment when that project is subsequently put out to tender,' said
Mr Davies.
The higher cost of private finance, he said, would be offset by improved
management and cost control.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Gas field contract announced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST land-based contract for the Pounds 1.2bn development of Liverpool
Bay's gas field was announced yesterday, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes.
The project will deliver offshore gas through a terminal at Point of Ayr at
the mouth of the River Dee by underground pipeline to a new power station at
Connah's Quay, Clwyd, north Wales.
The Pounds 60m contract to build the terminal has gone to AOC International.
David McLean Contractors, which is based in nearby Flint, north Wales, will
carry out associated civil works. Up to 700 local jobs will be created.
Offshore contracts have still to be awarded by Hamilton Oil, which is
developing the field with Lasmo and Monument. Hamilton said yesterday
offshore specifications have not been finalised.
GEC Alsthom is to build the 1,350 MW station for PowerGen.
The contract for the terminal assumes the first gas will be pumped into
Wales in 1996.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Lamont foresees M-way sell-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE INTRODUCTION of charges for motorists could pave the way for the
privatisation of large parts of Britain's motorway network, Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, said yesterday.
Mr Lamont said at a Confederation of British Industry conference on raising
private finance for public projects that there was no limit on developments
which could be financed by private investment.
'From now on, any project which can be paid for from user charges and can
satisfy the normal planning requirements can proceed. If someone wants to
build a road, and private citizens are willing to pay to use it, why should
the government stand in the way?
'All over the world people have come to see what private finance can do.
They are familiar with privately financed roads in Asia and North America
and there is absolutely no reason why the benefits of private finance should
not be enjoyed more widely in Britain too.'
The chancellor said that private finance could transform the way in which
major capital projects were carried out in Britain in the 1990s - in the
same way that the country had been transformed in the 1980s by the
privatisation of state-owned industries like telephone and water services.
'We cannot look to public finances to fund the kind of improvements to the
road network we all want to see,' Mr Lamont said. He added that it did not
make sense for motorways which were used only by a proportion of motorists
to be paid for by the general taxpayer. Charges would have the benefit of
stopping people treating roads as if they were free and to 'think carefully
about how they really needed to use them'.
'If charges were introduced, that could ultimately pave the way for the
privatisation of large parts of the motorway network,' said the chancellor.
He said the government was prepared to consider joint ventures with the
private sector where developments would not be justified on commercial
grounds alone but also on social benefits such as congestion reduction.
The chancellor, for the first time, gave some guidance on how these might
work, saying: 'In many cases, I hope that the project's promoter will retain
all the equity in the project with the exchequer simply making a one-off
contribution.'
The size of this public-sector contribution might be determined by bids from
rival promoters in the private sector. Bids that require heavy investment
from the public sector would seem less likely to succeed than those offering
greater involvement by the private sector.
Mr Lamont said any project could go ahead provided it satisfied three
principles: proper value for money for taxpayers; private participation in
joint ventures should be decided on the basis of competition; and a
substantial degree of risk should be transferred to the private sector.
He said: 'Time and budget overruns are not confined to the public sector but
they are resisted more fiercely when investors' money is at stake. We can
see that all too clearly with the Channel tunnel.'

FT  27 MAY 93 / Cambodian Elections: Khmer Rouge keeps the world guessing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PHNOM PENH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was a time when mere mention of the words Khmer Rouge was enough to
strike fear into the hearts of Cambodians. It was Khmer Rouge cadres who
executed, starved and tortured to death about 1m people in the attempt
between 1975 and 1978 to build a rural, racially pure and communist state.
More recently, the Khmer Rouge has violated a 1991 peace agreement and
killed several United Nations peacekeepers, including three Bulgarians
gunned down in their UN camp by previously friendly Khmer Rouge guerrillas
they had invited to supper.
The Khmer Rouge's confused response to the UN-organised election this week,
however, has dented its reputation for single-minded ruthlessness.
Khmer Rouge radio broadcasts, notices pinned to trees, and visiting bands of
guerrillas had warned Cambodian villagers not to vote, on the grounds that
it would legitimise the government installed in 1979 by the Vietnamese
invasion which overthrew the Khmer Rouge regime. Voters were threatened with
death.
Not only were the threats ignored (the turnout was at least 85 per cent),
but Khmer Rouge leaders in several districts actually let people go to the
polls and encouraged them to vote for the royalist party Funcinpec, the main
opposition party standing in the election. Widespread attacks on polling
stations, expected by the UN, did not materialise.
The Khmer Rouge seems to have dithered and then decided against an all-out
assault on the vulnerable polling stations scattered across the country, in
the hope that Funcinpec, its former ally against the Vietnamese occupation,
will win a majority and grant the Khmer Rouge a role in government.
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, Funcinpec leader, has promised to hand executive
power to his father Prince Norodom Sihanouk if Funcinpec wins, and Prince
Sihanouk, backed by China, had spoken of the need to bring the Khmer Rouge
into government in the interests of national reconciliation.
The many enemies of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and abroad are worried that
Prince Sihanouk, far from punishing the organisation for its intransigence
and unwillingness to submit itself to a popular vote, is poised to reward it
with an undeserved share of power.
They argue, it would be folly to let the Khmer Rouge into a weak coalition
government without insisting its guerrilla army be dismantled.
Prince Sihanouk yesterday sought to ease fears that he might accommodate the
Khmer Rouge by completely reversing his stand on the issue. He told European
parliamentarians the guerrillas had suffered a defeat from which they would
not recover and he now opposed Khmer Rouge participation in government.
'The election is a great success for Cambodia and the world, and an
unbelievable defeat for the Khmer Rouge,' the notoriously fickle prince was
quoted as saying by Mr Claude Cheysson, the European MP and former French
foreign minister.
The Khmer Rouge is keeping its options open, and its fighters are prepared
to continue the civil war if necessary.
According to Mr Yasushi Akashi, chief of the UN Transitional Authority in
Cambodia, Khmer Rouge front-line military strength has increased by 50 per
cent to about 15,000 men since last year: 'They seem to be headed by more
dedicated, more determined, more active and aggressive commanders.'
Mr Akashi's figures are disputed - other estimates suggest there are 12,000
Khmer Rouge front-line troops - but there is no doubt that Khmer Rouge
guerrilla units have used the 19 months since the peace agreement to seize
territory previously controlled by allies such as Funcinpec.
The Cambodian government has vowed to treat Khmer Rouge fighters as bandits
if it wins the election, but there are doubts if the guerrillas can be
crushed in the same way as previous communist insurgencies in Malaysia or
Thailand.
Before contacts between the UN and the Khmer Rouge were severed a few weeks
ago in the face of Khmer Rouge threats, the guerrillas in some districts
impressed UN military observers with their discipline and smart uniforms;
they apparently treated villagers well and paid for the rice they took. In
other areas, however, they are notorious for forcing peasants to work for
them and for seizing control of paddy fields by planting mines.
Khmer Rouge leaders struck a sympathetic chord with nationalistic Cambodians
by massacring immigrant Vietnamese fishermen and condemning corruption in
the Vietnamese-backed Cambodian government, but their own dealings with
corrupt generals from Thailand (Cambodia's other traditional enemy) have not
gone unnoticed.
Publicly, Khmer Rouge leaders admit to 'mistakes' in the past and say they
are free marketeers rather than communists. Most Cambodians, however, are
convinced they have neither repented nor abandoned their own destructive
brand of leftism.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Mandela plea after radicals quit talks
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, yesterday
sought to maintain the momentum of the country's democracy negotiations
after the ultra-radical Pan Africanist Congress said it was suspending
participation in the talks.
PAC President Clarence Makwethu announced the PAC would boycott
constitutional negotiations until police released all members of the PAC and
its armed wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Army, detained since
Tuesday. Police said 73 people had been arrested, with 15 released
yesterday.
Mr Makwethu also called for the return of documents and computers seized in
raids on PAC offices throughout South Africa.
But Mr Mandela urged South Africans not to panic over the issue, saying:
'Since we began the negotiating process in 1990, we have had a number of
problems. This is one of them.
'I'm sure that the democratic forces are strong enough to overcome this
crisis.'
The PAC's decision to boycott talks could make it difficult for the 26
negotiating parties to meet their self-imposed deadline of June 3 for
agreement on a date for the first multi-racial elections.
But on its own the PAC, believed to have only limited electoral support,
cannot block progress.
Controversy has arisen over the fact that the government's chief negotiator,
Mr Roelf Meyer, was not informed about the arrests, which have come at a
critical stage in the negotiating process.
The PAC responded angrily to the arrests, saying it would act 'brutally and
ruthlessly' against white South Africans unless police immediately freed
their members.
Government officials said racist rhetoric such as this prompted police to
act against members of the PAC, whose followers have adopted the slogan 'one
settler, one bullet'.
Although the military strength of the PAC armed wing, APLA, is minimal,
individuals claiming to be APLA members have carried out numerous murders of
white farmers and holidaymakers in recent months, seriously damaging white
morale.
The PAC leadership has been ambivalent at best when asked to condemn such
attacks. Police say they expect to charge many of those held for various
crimes, including murder.
Meanwhile, the ANC distanced itself from a demand made last weekend by Mr
Mandela for the official voting age to be lowered to 14. Mr Mandela shocked
politicians across South Africa's spectrum when he made the call in an
apparent bid to win support from militant township youths.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Keating pays price of promises: Australian budgeting after
unexpected election win
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMILIA TAGAZA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE Australian budget-framing season gets under way the newly re-elected
Labor government is buckling down to the task with a starting-point deficit
of at least ADollars 15.9bn (Pounds 7.1bn).
Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, grappling with record unemployment, has
promised to create 500,000 jobs during his three-year term. The extra
stimulatory spending required is in addition to the ADollars 4.5bn he has
injected over the past 12 months to prod the stubborn economy into life and
pull down the unemployment rate.
The problem for Mr Keating is that even without additional new spending, the
deficit over the next three years, barring an economic miracle, is likely to
remain high.
His government is pledged to deliver personal tax cuts, worth ADollars 8.6bn
between 1994 and 1996. Other expensive pre-election spending promises are
expected to cost another ADollars 2.2bn over the next three years.
The package is part of a Dutch auction between Labor and the opposition
conservative coalition parties - a cynical vote-buying exercise by a
demoralised Labor party which had held little hope of being re-elected.
Perhaps it was for this reason that it did not count on having to deliver
the package which offered something to important voting blocs: women,
pensioners and small business.
Few were surprised when only two months after its return to power, the
government backed down on some of its pledges, including an ADollars 100m to
buy out private hospital places to reduce surgery queues.
The promised tax cuts will be more difficult to break because they have been
enshrined in law.
Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer, said this week the government would
have to cut ADollars 2bn from existing programmes to keep the 1993-94 budget
deficit to ADollars 16bn.
It may have just about exhausted its arsenal however. All the fiscal
stimulus of the last 12 months and all the interest rate cuts over the last
two years have not delivered the hoped-for private investment.
Official figures released yesterday show a 9 per cent drop in Australian
capital spending during the three months to March.
Mr Keating's forecast of an average 4 per cent growth between 1992 and 1993
has been adjusted to between 2.5 and 3 per cent.
Labor's hopes that import tariff reductions (from 20 per cent in the
mid-1980s to 5 per cent by the end of the century) would, by exposing it to
international competition, make Australian industry more efficient and
provide long-term economic growth have so far been unfulfilled.
Jobs have been lost rather than gained. Manufacturing turnover in 1991-92
was 2 per cent less than the previous year.
The government is under pressure to pause, or at least slow down, the
scheduled tariff cuts. A pause could bring in ADollars 2bn in revenue that
would otherwise be lost to tariff cuts.
Meanwhile, the continuing deficit in the current account puts extra
constraints on government spending. The latest monthly figure, a deficit of
ADollars 2.1bn, was the highest monthly shortfall in more than three years.
The high current account deficits recorded in the last several years have
left net foreign debt of ADollars 168bn or 43 per cent of gross domestic
product. For the moment, low world interest rates have reduced that service
to 14.5 per cent of export income from a peak of 21 per cent.
An alternative measure which could help keep the lid on the budget deficit
is to raise taxes. However, Mr Keating is not prepared to discuss this, at
least for the moment.
He is in the prime minister's seat today because he ran a scare campaign
against the conservative opposition's proposed goods and services tax. To
talk about it early in this term would dent his political credibility.
However, the national interest may yet cause him to back down on another
election promise.

AN UNREPENTANT Mr Xu Wenli, one of China's longest serving dissidents, was
freed from jail yesterday three years before his 15-year sentence expired.
His early release, apparently aimed at calming criticism in the west of
human rights violations, came as China faced censure after an EC mission to
Tibet.
Appearing gaunt and with several of his teeth missing, Mr Xu denied any
wrongdoing on his release, saying his political activities had been 'for my
country and my people'.
Mr Xu, 49, one of China's best-known dissidents, was arrested in 1981 and
sentenced the following year. He had published an underground magazine,
April 5 Forum, during the Democracy Wall protest period of the late 1970s
and is the sixth political prisoner to be given early release this year. The
gesture coincides with Washington's decision, due by next week, on renewal
of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status. It also appears to be aimed
at improving its chances of winning the right to stage the 2000 Olympiad.
Mr Xu's release came as EC representatives met in Beijing to complete a
report of their recent mission to Tibet. The mission ended in recrimination
at the weekend with envoys protesting over detention of two Tibetans who had
been planning to make contact.
Kieran Cooke adds from Singapore: China says it will not use force to pursue
its claim to the spratlys, the disputed group of islands in the South China
Sea.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Asia looking to gas for expanding energy market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ASIA'S energy capacity is set to expand to a level where it will surpass the
power capacity of the US by the year 2010, an Asia energy analyst said
yesterday at a Financial Times conference in Sing-apore.
Mr Daniel Goldman of US energy specialists Arthur D Little said governments,
the private sector and the multilateral agencies not only had to find the
funds for power generating expansion, they also had to find adequate
supplies of fuel.
He said gas fuel was an increasingly attractive option, mainly because of
cost and environmental factors. While Asia had abundant gas reserves, a
tripling of demand for gas in the region between now and the year 2000 would
result in regional supply shortages. At present about 12 per cent of Asia's
power is generated by gas.
Mr Guy Doyle, associate editor of International Coal Report, said coal
accounted for about 36 per cent of total generation in the region.
While he accepted that gas was the most favoured fuel, India and China, the
region's two biggest coal users, would continue to get the bulk of their
power needs from coal.
Some speakers at the conference said that serious environmental problems
would occur in the medium term if China and India did not switch to other
fuels or invest in new, more technologically advanced coal plants.
Mr Woodrow Williams of General Electric Nuclear Energy said nuclear energy
had become more acceptable and that there was considerable interest in its
use in most Asian countries. Japan, South Korea and Taiwan already had
considerable nuclear energy programmes. Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia
were investigating the possibilities of nuclear power.
Mr Frank Gray, conference chairman and editor of the Power in Asia
newsletter, said that over the past year several governments in the region
had implemented or announced plans to privatise their power utilities and
had also made conditions more attractive for private sector participation in
the power sector.
'The Philippines, which has been gripped by a power crisis, now says that
the immediate problems will be solved by the autumn. But the basic question
for everyone remains one of money. If power in the region is to grow as
forecast, enormous sums of capital have to be mobilised,' said Mr Gray.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE officials were yesterday at pains to damp speculation on foreign
exchange markets about US support for a higher yen as the Japanese currency
surged to a record Y108.65 to the US dollar.
Japanese government bond prices moved sharply higher. But the stock market's
Nikkei average closed only 264.23 points up at 20,895.99.
The yen's renewed appreciation in Tokyo followed strong dollar selling in
New York on Tuesday triggered by a US Treasury Department report to Congress
stating that a higher yen could help reverse Japan's huge trade surplus.
The report said that while the administration believed exchange rates should
reflect economic fundamentals, a decline of the dollar against the yen could
be seen as a reflection of forces tending to limit and ultimately reverse
Japan's widening trade surplus. The currency markets took it as indicating
US support for a higher yen to reduce Japan's Dollars 111bn (Pounds 72bn)
trade surplus, a view which has been fuelled by comments from US officials
earlier this year.
Yesterday's market reaction to the Treasury report is likely to have
irritated Japanese officials, increasingly concerned that the yen's 12 per
cent appreciation against the dollar since the beginning of the year could
hold back the country's economic recovery, widely expected later this year.
Japanese officials said the market was overreacting and moved quickly to
counter suggestions that it was US policy to guide the yen higher.
The Japanese authorities were joined in their attempts to damp speculation
by Mr Lawrence Summers, US undersecretary of the treasury, who said in
Washington that the report did not aim to outline US policy but simply
stated a fact.
In April, President Bill Clinton's remark that a stronger yen could reduce
Japan's trade surplus led to a bout of dollar selling.
While US officials attempted to play down those remarks, more recently Mr
Ron Brown, US secretary of commerce, triggered a similar dollar sell-off by
stating that market-driven exchange rate movements could correct the
US-Japan trade imbalance.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government is to propose to China that the two countries resume
bilateral security negotiations, frozen after the crushing of the Chinese
democracy movement four years ago.
Japanese officials will raise the sensitive issue during a visit by Mr Qian
Qichen, the Chinese foreign minister, due in Tokyo this Saturday, in the
hope of drawing Beijing into regional security discussions amid raising
concerns about the expanding capability of the People's Liberation Army.
The Japanese Foreign Ministry is divided over how to handle China's
increasingly sophisticated military technology, which some officials fear is
changing the balance of power in the region and creating a potential
long-term threat.
But the Chinese government does not welcome outside advice on the conduct of
its military affairs, and the Japanese government would like Beijing to
participate in broader discussions on regional security, which could include
China's capability.
Japan would also raise issues such as North Korea's military intentions and
its pullout from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, as well as the
changing role of Russia in the region and the future of Cambodia.
Links were cut in 1989 in protest at the PLA's role in the crushing of the
Chinese democracy movement, but Tokyo has become anxious to restart
discussions and believes Mr Qian's visit provides an appropriate
opportunity.
Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, a faction head of the ruling Liberal Democratic party,
has expressed concern about the modernisation of China's military,
highlighted by a planned 14.9 per cent increase in spending for fiscal 1993,
but the Japanese government, generally, has been timid on the issue.

PAKISTAN'S supreme court yesterday restored Mr Nawaz Sharif to office as
prime minister, apparently delivering a severe setback to President Ghulam
Ishaq Khan, who had dismissed him five weeks ago.
The National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, was also reinstated
after being dissolved by the president. A presidential spokesman said that
Mr Khan would honour the court's decision.
The judgment, supported by 10 out of 11 judges, came after a three-week
hearing on a petition filed by Mr Sharif challenging the presidential order.
'We hold that the order of April 18, 1993, passed by the president of
Pakistan, is not within the ambit of the powers conferred on the president.
. . and has therefore been passed without lawful authority,' the court said.
The decision removed from office an interim government installed by the
president which had included members of Ms Benazir Bhutto's opposition
party. It meant that elections which Mr Khan had called for July 14 would
not be necessary.
However, Mr Sharif's future remained uncertain amid talk of moves to remove
him through a vote of no confidence in the National Assembly, perhaps as
early as today.
Ms Bhutto said: 'The political reality is that the people and the country
want fresh elections to choose a representative government.' Boarding a
flight from Karachi to Islamabad, she said: 'We must proceed with great
caution to see that Pakistan is safe from any chaos.'
The detailed judgment has not been published. It is believed to have been
made partly on the grounds that the president acted in haste without trying
to resolve a government crisis through mediation. Mr Sharif had been seeking
to remove the presidential powers which Mr Khan used to dismiss him, as well
to eject Ms Bhutto's government in 1990.
Mr Sharif described the judgment as an important milestone in Pakistan's
history. He led a crowd to Islamabad's Faisal mosque where he offered
prayers of thanksgiving.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Ruling puts democracy back on track: Why business confidence
is likely to return to Pakistan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BALL is back in the court of Pakistan's politicians. Yesterday's
decision by the supreme court in Islamabad has returned the country to the
path of democratic development five weeks after it seemed in danger of being
derailed.
In a landmark decision, the court reversed last month's dissolution of the
National Assembly and restored to office the government of Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif.
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan's dismissal of the government on April 18 was
the third time since the lifting of martial law in 1985 that a prime
minister had been sacked while in office, under powers introduced by the
late military dictator, General Zia ul-Haq.
The constitutional amendments had strengthened presidential powers, allowing
him to remove prime ministers, dissolve parliament and call fresh elections.
But the supreme court's ruling has apparently ended those arbitrary powers,
or at least severely curtailed their use by any president in the future.
Mr Sharif's attempt to secure a vote in the National Assembly on curbing the
president's powers had led to his dismissal by Mr Khan.
Mr Sharif was due to call a session of the 217-seat assembly to seek a fresh
vote of confidence, intended to reinforce his political credentials, close
aides said after the court verdict.
However, the session could equally provide an opportunity to unseat him
again. Mr Sharif's opponents in parliament, including those loyal to
opposition leader Ms Benazir Bhutto and to the president, had been
discussing ways to vote Mr Sharif out should the assembly be restored.
Mr Hamid Nasir Chattha, who resigned from Mr Sharif's cabinet before his
government was sacked, said last night that 'the matter is not over'. He
said dissidents from Mr Sharif's party would continue to oppose him in the
assembly.
Politicians loyal to Mr Chattha said the dissidents were examining the
possibility of an alliance with the opposition People's Democratic Alliance,
led by Ms Bhutto, in an effort to remove the restored government. However,
the extent of support on both sides in the assembly is unlikely to become
clear until members begin to express their opinions in parliament.
The Sharif camp remains convinced that it has the support of enough members
to block any such moves.
If Mr Sharif survived the vote, it would clearly be difficult for him to
co-exist with Mr Khan, since the two men are now bitter enemies. Mr Sharif
could be further undermined by the four provincial governments, which are
known to be loyal to the president and have an uneasy relationship with the
prime minister.
In Pakistan's 46-year history, army generals have ruled for 24 of them.
Under civilian rule, Pakistan has seen 13 prime ministers, most of whom were
removed from office or resigned before completing their terms.
Despite the army's past role in running the country, yesterday's court
decision followed several weeks of assurances from military officials that
they have no plans to take power.
Nevertheless, the restored government faces huge political as well as
economic challenges. Mr Sharif has overseen a period of radical economic
reform but appeared to be running into problems at the time of his
dismissal.
The fiscal year which ends on June 30 is expected to close with one of
Pakistan's largest budget deficits. Tax evasion and substantial expenditures
on defence as well as debt servicing have left little room for increasing
development expenditures. A thriving black economy which is estimated by
some to be almost half the size of the national economy has set back efforts
to improve revenue collection.
Foreign exchange reserves dipped to Dollars 450m (Pounds 292.2m) from
Dollars 800m when the government fell. However, Mr Sartaj Aziz, who was
finance minister under Mr Sharif and is now likely to return to the same
position, said last night that the court's decision will end the
uncertainty.
'The restoration of the government will restore business confidence,' Mr
Aziz said, adding that economic reforms would be put back on track.
Government officials said last night that Mr Aziz and other ministers would
hold a series of meetings with business leaders within the next week, in an
effort to revive confidence.
They are expected to assure businesses that initiatives such as the
privatisation programme will go ahead unhindered.

AN UNREPENTANT Mr Xu Wenli, one of China's longest serving dissidents, was
freed from jail yesterday three years before his 15-year sentence expired.
His early release, apparently aimed at calming criticism in the West of
human rights violations, came as China faced censure over an EC mission to
Tibet.
Appearing gaunt and with several of his teeth missing, Mr Xu denied any
wrongdoing on his release, saying his political activities had been 'for my
country and my people'.
Mr Xu, 49, one of China's best-known dissidents, was arrested in 1981 and
sentenced the following year. He had been publisher of an underground
magazine, April 5 Forum, during the Democracy Wall protest period of the
late 1970s and is the sixth political prisoner to be given early release
this year. The Chinese gesture coincides with Washington's decision, due by
next week, on renewal of China's Most Favored Nation trading status. It also
appears to be aimed at improving its chances of securing endorsement for the
right to stage the 2000 Olympiad.
Mr Xu's release came as EC representatives met in Beijing to complete a
report of their recent mission to Tibet. The mission ended in recrimination
at the weekend with envoys protesting over detention of two Tibetans who had
been planning to make contact.
The streets of Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, were reported calm yesterday
after disturbances on Sunday and Monday in which large crowds of protesters
were dispersed by tear gas. Foreign travellers reported hearing automatic
gunfire.
Kieran Cooke adds from Singapore: China says it will not use force to pursue
its claim to the Spratlys, the disputed group of islands in the South China
Sea.
Mr Chi Haotian, the Chinese defence minister, who is visiting Malaysia, said
China still insists on its 'historical right' to the Spratly islands. But Mr
Chi said China also accepted the 'differing opinions' of other claimants -
Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan and Brunei.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Congress has slashed its aid budget for next year to accommodate the
Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.16bn) that President Bill Clinton has promised to
Russia and republics of the former Soviet Union, George Graham writes from
Washington.
Congressman David Obey, chairman of the House of Representatives' committee
in charge of foreign aid spending said it was 'not a pleasant job'. He
reduced the total aid budget by Dollars 1.4bn to Dollars 12.9bn, imposing a
2 per cent across-the-board cut on all programmes and stiffer reductions in
some areas.
The new aid bill will eliminate the Dollars 70m proposed as the US's
contribution to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Mr
Obey said the EBRD should not expect more money unless it replaced its
directors or underwent 'a radical attitude transplant'. The US contribution
to the International Development Association, the soft loan unit of the
World Bank, has also been slashed.
Bilateral aid to many third world countries will suffer as the
administration remains committed to preserving support to Israel and Egypt,
which already use up about 40 per cent of the total aid budget. Aid to other
countries will be cut further to keep Israel's and Egypt's share unchanged.

FT  27 MAY 93 / White House follies upstage Bosnia and the budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXPENSIVE presidential haircuts by Belgians called Christophe and cancelled
Dollars 15,000 (Pounds 9,740) breakfasts for lobbyists, even the shenanigans
in the White House travel office, could be dismissed as perfect 'silly
season' stories. Except for the fact, which is unfortunate for Bill Clinton,
that a combination of the budget, on which the House votes today, and Bosnia
make this far from a silly season.
Earlier this week, George Stephanopoulos, the communications director of the
modish coif, ruefully admitted that 'clearly last week did not go as
planned'. His boss blithely claimed the reverse was the case, because the
Ways and Means Committee had agreed a budget bill to his liking, though it
actually did so nearly two weeks ago. He did not adduce the latest Bosnian
agreement as evidence of 'a good week'.
Of the three incidents, 'Travelgate' threatens to have the longest
shelf-life, but all three, in the opinion of the president's growing army of
critics, demonstrate that something is seriously amiss with Mr Clinton's
sense of what is right and the White House's perception of what is wrong.
The on-board haircut that kept Air Force One on the ground at Los Angeles
airport for an hour is seen as a mistake because it showed the president had
lost his common touch, not least with the airline commuters he may have
inconvenienced. Worse, in the eyes of Washington, it was further evidence
that he had fallen under the sway of Hollywood, whose stars all have
'personal contracts' with hairdressers, face-lifters and individual trainers
and frequently these days seem to be occupying the Lincoln bedroom in the
White House.
The Democratic party fundraising breakfast for lobbyists seemed similarly
insensitive, since the president is supposed to be intent on curbing their
influence and cutting down on their tax deductions.
Travelgate is altogether messier because it involves, in no particular order
of importance:
The summary dismissal of career employees accused of mismanagement but
denied the right of appeal: the humiliating volte face on Tuesday night,
apparently rescinding the firing of five of the seven, but without restoring
their jobs, merely compounds the confusion.
The misuse of the FBI, called into investigate without the prior approval of
the agency's ultimate chief, Janet Reno, the attorney general, who, being
Janet Reno, has made her discontent about its politicisation public and
extracted an apology from the White House.
Nepotism, because a distant cousin of the president from Arkansas, who did a
lot of travel work for his campaign, wrote a memo in February explaining how
the travel office could be better run, and volunteered herself for the task.
Hollywood again, with cronyism added, because Harry Thomason, the Clinton
friend and Los Angeles-based TV producer, has interests in the airline
charter business which, in turn, complained about not being able to bid for
White House press flight contracts.
The extent of Mr Clinton's personal knowledge of any and all of the above is
in doubt, though sooner or later he will be asked what he knew and when he
knew it. So far he has confessed only to a general awareness.
But this is hardly the point, for he is the man in charge of the White House
staff and it is in the hottest of waters, a mere three weeks after it was
supposedly shaken up and down and reinforced by the arrival as deputy chief
of staff of Mr Roy Neel, Vice President Al Gore's veteran and politically
smart adviser.
The fundamental lack, a common argument goes, is that there is no one in the
White House with the clout to say to the president, 'This is wrong', or
'Have you considered the political fallout?' Thomas 'Mack' McLarty, the
chief of staff, does not seem able to do this; Bernard Nussbaum, the legal
counsel not long out of Wall Street, could apparently see nothing wrong with
inviting the FBI in for help; even Mr Stephanopoulos himself, with
supposedly sharp political antennae, did not see the danger signals.
Mr Gore went on TV to deny charges that the White House is too stuffed with
the young and politically unsophisticated. 'We've got a lot of veterans,' he
insisted. But former presidential candidate Paul Tsongas was closer to the
prevailing wisdom when he said Mr Clinton 'needs a few greybeards around
him'.
Though far from grey, it may be significant that his sharp campaign crew,
James Carville, Paul Begala, Mandy Grunwald and Stan Greenberg, are being
sighted more around the White House these days. It was, after all, Mr
Carville who posted up the immortal placard, 'It's the economy, stupid', to
keep the Clinton campaign team's minds focused.
But it is also true that Mr Clinton consciously set up this White House to
his own liking. They are his sort of policy people and, collegial though
their working environment may be, they do defer to him because they are in
awe of his intellect and application. Therefore their faults are seen as
extensions of his.
And it could not have come at a worse time. Perhaps it has provided some
cover for the difficulties the administration has in explaining its Bosnian
policies, but, domestically, it has distracted far more from the overriding
order of business, which is to get the budget package through Congress.
A president who is considered fair game by the press can become dead meat at
the hands of Bob Dole, Sam Nunn, and half a dozen others at the other end of
town who probably think they can do the job better.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Guatemalan president tightens grip: Government controls

<TEXT>
THE Guatemalan government yesterday moved to tighten its control over the
country, a day after President Jorge Serrano suspended the constitution and
closed down congress and the supreme court.
Although Mr Serrano said early on Tuesday that his move would not affect
freedom of expression, the government was yesterday controlling radio and TV
broadcasts. It has sent censors to monitor newspapers, while police
surrounded the offices of the two largest morning papers.
Opposition to Mr Serrano's action came at home and abroad. Mr Mario
Solorzano, the minister of labour and a vice-president of Socialist
International, resigned in protest at the moves.
He said the president had removed the possibility of reaching peace in
Guatemala and believed it would no longer be possible for international
financial institutions to continue support for the government.
The constitutional court, the highest judicial body in Guatemala, declared
the president's actions invalid.
The US put its Dollars 67m (Pounds 43.5m) aid programme to Guatemala under
review, the State Department said, but did not say if the aid was suspended.
Foreign ministers of the Organisation of American States are expected to
meet in Washington on June 3 over Guatemala, following condemnation of the
move by the US and almost all Latin American states, except for Peru.
A suspension of lending from international financial institutions could
follow the OAS meeting.
Mr Serrano, whose action is seen as emulating Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori's so-called 'self-coup' in April 1992, said he was thinking of
telephoning Mr Fujimori.
The government has a 15-month standby arrangement with the International
Monetary Fund which started last December, although the government has not
drawn the Dollars 54m available under the programme. Loans for the country
from the World Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank, which has
Dollars 110m of loans awaiting approval in the second half of the year,
could be jeopardised.
Soldiers yesterday surrounded the offices of a large union umbrella group.
Mr Alberto Villar, a committee member, said that his members would discuss
the possibility of calling a nationwide protest.
The human rights ombudsman, Mr Ramiro de Leon Carpio, came out of hiding to
protest at the move.
'The president doesn't have constitutional, legal or moral rights to take
the measures he did,' he told journalists. He called on different sectors of
society to put pressure on the regime to reverse its measures.
The British Foreign Office said the events in Guatemala had not led the
government to rethink its decision to remove its garrison of 1,400 troops in
neighbouring Belize.

US durable goods orders were flat in April, the Commerce Department said
yesterday, and order backlogs shrank to the lowest level in 4 1/2 years as
manufacturing business contracted, Reuter reports from Washington.
The unchanged orders total last month followed a revised drop of 3.7 per
cent in March, previously reported as 3.4 per cent. The figure was much
weaker than expected by Wall Street economists, who had forecast a 1.4 per
cent rise in orders.
April orders had been expected to rebound from March, when severe weather
hampered production in a number of industries. But the Commerce Department
report showed not only unchanged order volume but also fewer shipments of
finished products.
Total new orders in April were worth Dollars 130.3bn (Pounds 84.6bn).
Orders for defence goods, which experience wide monthly swings, rose by 2.9
per cent last month after 8.9 per cent in March. If defence is excluded,
overall orders in April fell by 0.1 per cent after decreasing by 4.3 per
cent in March.
'I found it to be a mildly disappointing report,' said Mr Dana Johnson,
vice-president and economist at First National Bank of Chicago.

priority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors, European Commission president, yesterday signalled a new
flexibility in the Gatt global trade talks, urging all sides to agree to
liberalise services such as banking and insurance.
The call marks a shift in emphasis since, six months ago, Mr Delors was
outspoken in his defence of European farm interests in the Uruguay Round.
The new focus on services echoes long-standing US and British arguments that
the EC - and particularly France - should pay less attention to agriculture.
Mr Delors' remarks came in a speech to the European parliament in
Strasbourg, and reflect his concern about rising unemployment in the EC and
the Community's diminishing competitiveness.
In his speech, Mr Delors noted that between 1970 and 1990 the US had created
29m jobs, Japan 11m, and the EC 8.8m. 'We need to think about that - and to
underline (our) interest in a Gatt agreement.'
The Commission president, who has ordered a study of Europe's
competitiveness and the unemployment crisis, recalled that services made up
half of EC GNP but only 20 per cent of EC exports.
US and EC negotiators are making good progress in their efforts to wrap up a
substantial Gatt market access package at the Group of Seven industrialised
nations' summit in Tokyo in July, according to senior officials on both
sides.
Both stress that Japan's willingness to offer greater access in financial
services will be critical to a deal. The idea is to set a market access deal
alongside the US-EC Blair House accord to form a broad foundation for a
comprehensive agreement to complete the Uruguay Round this year.

US officials yesterday claimed progress in talks aimed at opening up
Japanese financial services markets to US businesses, and said they would
press for an agreement on market access by the Group of Seven summit in
Tokyo in early July.
After talks in Washington between Mr Larry Summers, US Treasury
undersecretary for international affairs, and Mr Tadao Chino, vice minister
for international affairs at Japan's Finance Ministry, a US official said
agreement on financial services was crucial to the general services section
of the Uruguay Round of talks on liberalising Gatt.
The US has pressed for greater access to securities underwriting, asset
management, banking and derivatives trading in Japan.
A Treasury official said the two countries had agreed to continue talks,
particularly on derivatives, including stock index futures and options.
Striking transatlantic differences in attitudes to international trade
agreements are revealed in a survey to be published this week, Tim Dickson
reports.
It shows that while a large majority of US chief executives consider the
North American Free Trade Agreement far more important than the Uruguay
Round of Gatt - and expect to benefit from it - their European counterparts
believe Nafta will have little impact on their economies.
Three out of five European chief executives believe agreement on the Uruguay
Round would strengthen their economies, with only half the Americans holding
this view.
The survey by the Conference Board also finds national budget deficits and
healthcare costs are top of both European and American worry lists.

TEN governments and steel companies have submitted proposals to the US
Commerce Department to settle 34 'unfair' trade cases in the hope of
escaping punitive American tariffs on their flat-rolled steel exports.
This is the first sign that the cases could be settled with 'voluntary'
limits on steel trade like those agreed with the US during the 1980s. The
previous Bush administration vowed not to resort to what are essentially
steel quotas.
Instead, Mr Bush said he would stand back from the 'quasi-judicial' process
under which tariffs can be levied on products judged to be subsidised by
their governments or dumped at 'less than fair market value'. The Clinton
administration has indicated no change in steel policy.
The Commerce Department now has until midnight on June 21 to negotiate these
proposed 'suspension agreements' and to rule on 52 other dumping and
countervailing duty cases filed last year by the US steel industry. Trade
officials have indicated that suspension agreements would only be
satisfactory to the US producers if they included guaranteed price floors.
Countries whose governments or steel producers submitted proposed suspension
deals are: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Finland, Germany, Mexico,
Sweden, Poland and New Zealand.
Missing from the list are some of the biggest suppliers in Japan, Canada,
the UK, France, and Italy.
A Commerce official said the US would not consider settlement of the 34
cases unless the 'unfair trade practice' or its impact on US producers was
eliminated. No deal will be acceptable unless it is 'as advantageous as the
completion of the government's subsidy and dumping investigations'.
After June 21, the remaining cases must go to the US International Trade
Commission which determines if there has been injury. If cases drop out of
the process - through settlement or a rare finding that subsidies and
dumping have not taken place - the ITC commissioners could find it more
difficult to return an injury finding.
With three Democrats and three Republicans on the commission, the ITC is now
believed to be more inclined to rule for domestic producers.

INDIA is sending a high-powered business delegation to the UK and France
next week to promote trade and investment.
The British visit follows other initiatives to stimulate bilateral business,
including a trip by Mr John Major, the prime minister, and leading
businessmen to India this year.
The Indian delegation will be led by Mr RP Goenka, head of one of India's
largest commercial groups and a former president of the Federation of Indian
Chambers of Commerce, organiser of the mission.
Britain was last year the fourth largest foreign investor in India, with
planned investments totalling Dollars 41m (Pounds 26.6m), up from Dollars
13m in 1991. France was the 15th largest overseas investor, with planned
investments in 1992 worth Dollars 10m.
India's software exports rose in the year to March by 37 per cent to Dollars
225m, according to figures this week from the National Association of
Software and Service Companies. The government has targeted software as a
key export industry. The UK-based Caparo Group's proposal to set up a
3m-tonne integrated steel plant in Orissa, east India, with the state
government as the partner has been cleared by the cabinet committee on
foreign investment and the Indian Foreign Investment Board, writes Kunal
Bose in Calcutta.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Christopher reasserts US world role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, asserted yesterday that
'the need for American leadership in the post-cold war world remains
undiminished' and that the US stood 'prepared to act decisively to protect
our interests wherever and whenever it is necessary'.
But, in a separate television interview, he argued that the US must limit
its involvement in Bosnia or risk an 'indefinite' military commitment.
Americans, he said, had little enthusiasm for involvement 'in a humanitarian
crisis a long way from home in the middle of another continent'.
His comments, backed by similar statements about US leadership from Ms Dee
Dee Myers, the White House press spokeswoman, appeared intended to counter a
speech given on Tuesday by an unidentified senior State Department official,
believed to be Mr Peter Tarnoff, undersecretary for political affairs.
This off-the-record speech to journalists emphasised the primacy of US
economic interests and the limits of US resources. US foreign policy must be
'commensurate with these realities,' and 'may on occasion fall short of what
some Americans would like and others would hope for,' he said.
Mr Christopher, under fire as the architect of the policy that opposes a US
military presence in Bosnia, insisted to the Washington Post that 'there is
no derogation of our powers and our responsibility to lead'. But, he said in
a clear reference to the Balkans, 'in some situations we will try to involve
other countries - we would not remain a superpower for long if we have to do
everything on our own'.
But his dismissive reference to humanitarian issues in Bosnia also runs
counter to one of the administration's basic foreign policy principles. In
another indication of this apparent ambivalence this week the US made
available an additional Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.4m) to the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees, but Mrs Sadako Ogata, the commissioner, had been
unable by midday yesterday to secure a session with Mr Christopher or
President Bill Clinton.
Mrs Ogata is also understood to be personally upset by a deal struck between
Mr Christopher and Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, under
which she loses her current American deputy.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GATT disputes panel has ruled that the European Community's banana import
regime unfairly limits Latin American exports, trade sources said yesterday,
Reuter reports from Geneva.
The ruling was seen as a test case likely to encourage Latin American
nations to protest against a new EC quota scheme which sets even higher
tariffs on their bananas from July 1.
The panel recommended six EC member states remove their discriminatory
quotas and lower their tariff rates for Latin American producers to bring
them into line with those for other Gatt signatories, the sources said.
'The EC did lose,' said one trade source familiar with the report, which is
still confidential.
'The panel found two violations of Gatt provisions,' another said.
The report is also seen as a blow to African, Caribbean and Pacific
countries, which have enjoyed favourable access to some EC markets despite
their higher prices.
The 111 Gatt member states will be asked at a meeting of the ruling council
on June 16 to adopt the report formally.
The new regime will allow the annual import of 2m tonnes of bananas from
Latin America at a tariff of Dollars 117 (Pounds 75.90) a tonne. Shipments
over this limit will be charged at the rate of Dollars 995 a tonne - thereby
favouring ACP producers.

FT  27 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Small case, loud implications - An
anti-dumping claim sounds a sour note
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian feud between the Prestinis and the Pisonis, being waged on US
shores, is not, they insist, about love or revenge.
It is instead a protracted trade dispute over access to the US market for
the tiny leather or synthetic pads which cushion the movement of keys on
woodwind and brass instruments.
The case is small in every way. It involves unit price differences of less
than one cent, and the Dollars 200,000 (Pounds 130,000) market for keypads
is the smallest ever to be disputed before a US trade body, according to one
lawyer.
Mr Giuseppe Prestini, who makes keypads in Nogales, Arizona, has been
claiming for the last decade that Mr Luciano Pisoni exported keypads from
his factory in Trento, Italy, for less than fair market value, a practice
known as 'dumping' in trade parlance. Mr Prestini says his rival is trying
to drive him out of business by claiming the one small portion of the US
market which he still supplies.
In 1976 Mr Prestini's family closed its Italian factory in Trento and set up
shop in Arizona. Several years later Mr Pisoni, who was the tool and dye
maker in Mr Prestini's plant, set up his own shop, exporting keypads from
Italy.
By 1983 exports were booming for Mr Pisoni, while sales dropped for his
former boss in the US. So Mr Prestini took his troubles to the US
government, asking it to find Mr Pisoni in violation of US anti-dumping
regulations.
The Commerce Department ruled in 1984 that Mr Pisoni had sold keypads in the
US for 1.16 per cent below fair market value. The finding was later
overturned after Mr Pisoni's lawyer, free trade crusader Mr Larry Klayman,
argued that the discrepancy was due to exchange rate fluctuations.
Now for the second time in a decade Mr Prestini is charging Mr Pisoni with
dumping in the US market.
The department last week issued a preliminary finding that Mr Pisoni sold
keypads in the US for 1.26 per cent below fair market value, a margin of
less than a cent, since the price for keypads ranges from 12 cents each for
clarinets to 78 cents for saxophones.
The department must make a final determination by August 2, and then the
International Trade Commission must find that the dumping caused the US
maker injury before the duties may be imposed.
Mr Klayman claims the new case is harassment. 'The US government is being
used again as a stooge to accomplish what Mr Prestini cannot do in the
market place,' Mr Klayman said.
Mr William Perry, representing Mr Prestini, believes Mr Prestini lost in
1984 only because he could not afford an attorney, while Mr Klayman
represented Mr Pisoni pro bono - without a fee.
He concedes that the trade law is sometimes used for protectionist ends and
admits that 'congress has created a Frankenstein'. However, he said, small
companies should have equal access to such measures.
Small cases like this are becoming increasingly common now that the ITC has
a Trade Remedy Assistance Office to help small businesses with such
proceedings. Mr Klayman says the office's existence is a conflict of
interest because the ITC acts as judge and adviser in disputes.
Ms Mary Davis, a TRAO attorney, denies the charge and says there is no
contact between the ITC commissioners and her office.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Fyodorov bares all on Russia's economic woes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THESE are the days of living dangerously in the Russian economy, but they
are also the days of unusual candour, at least as far as Mr Boris Fyodorov,
Russia's deputy prime minister in charge of the economy, is concerned.
On Tuesday night he delighted and awed Russian and foreign economists with a
candid snapshot of life in the upper echelons of the Russian government.
He admitted, for example, that everyone 'apart from poor people on the
street' was shifting out of roubles into dollars, legally and illegally, and
acknowledged that 'I would do the same'.
The government was 'failing in its public duty' to protect people and their
currency, and when it took two months to effect a money transfer in roubles
and a day or two in dollars, lawlessness was perfectly understandable. 'We
have a very small stick, and no carrots,' he added.
Mr Fyodorov was breathtakingly self-confident. He disclosed that today he
will propose to the cabinet that no promises for extra expenditure be
honoured by the government. That would stop politicians, including President
Yeltsin, from making populist gestures in an election campaign sure to be
forthcoming.
Mr Fyodorov clearly identified the government's lax populism as being more
dangerous than the parliament.
'It's not so bad,' he said of the parliament, which is public enemy number
one as far as Mr Yeltsin is concerned.
The government is, according to Mr Fyodorov, riven with dissension. Even
within his own ministry he spends much of his time 'stopping people putting
forward proposals the opposite of those I am fighting for'.
One of the most valuable pieces of advice he had received, he said, was from
Professor Jeffrey Sachs, the government adviser from Harvard University, to
the effect that any agreement reached had to be signed on the spot. Mr
Fyodorov says he now gets central bank officials to sign any deal as soon as
it is reached.
Though he hailed the recent agreement between the government and the central
bank which will allow the government access to the first Dollars 1.5bn
(Pounds 972m) tranche of the Dollars 3bn 'systemic transformation facility'
put up by the IMF, he clearly does not trust Mr Victor Gerashchenko, central
bank chairman, to fulfil it. 'It is a gentleman's agreement,' he said.
'Let's see how many gentlemen there will be in the central bank' - recalling
that Mr Gerashchenko had recently said that he (Mr Fyodorov would soon
'crawl to him' for more credits.
Mr Fyodorov does not believe in greater economic integration in the
Commonwealth of Independent States.
'You cannot believe in a union like this. So far I have not seen any
documents which say that there is any economic integration. . . I welcome
with pleasure the introduction of new currencies. We are pretending there is
a rouble zone when in fact there is none.'

NATO yesterday failed to provide a clear endorsement of the latest
five-nation peace plan for Bosnia, although Mr Les Aspin, US defence
secretary, said most allies were 'pretty receptive' to the proposals.
Mr Aspin and Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, said there were many
'unanswered questions' about the joint action programme agreed in Washington
at the weekend, particularly about its proposals for safe areas. They said
the UN Security Council had to make the next move.
Questions raised by Mr Worner included the definition of safe areas, the
kind of forces required and their rules of engagement.
Mr Aspin said the military option on which the US earlier failed to gain
allied support - a lifting of the arms embargo to Moslem-led Bosnian
government forces and air strikes - was still available.
'In the end it may be that we end up going back to that option,' he said.
After criticism of the new plan by Germany and particularly Turkey, Mr Aspin
admitted that 'not everybody was consulted equally'. However, he said he
believed the plan would be implemented. He strongly denied it implied
abandoning the aim of a wider political settlement.
'But it does move towards stopping the killing first,' he said.
A communique issued after a two-day defence ministers' meeting here
conspicuously avoided giving explicit approval to the joint action
programme, saying only that it had been discussed.
The meeting underlined Nato's concerns about the allies' ability to provide
forces for new peacekeeping or peace enforcement missions amid continuing
defence cuts.
Mr Worner said countries needed to invest in properly-prepared forces and it
was 'the duty of the hour' for allies to stabilise their defence spending.
However, Mr Worner angrily contested accusations that the alliance had
proved ineffective in responding to the Bosnian crisis.
Nato should not be blamed for any lack of political will, he said. It was
prepared to do more but could not act unless it was mandated to do so by the
UN.
'It makes no sense to accuse Nato because everybody knows it is the United
Nations and not Nato that handles this crisis,' Mr Worner said.
But he warned that if the international community failed to deal
successfully with the conflict it would damage all international
organisations, Nato included.

MR Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday said he would refuse
to co-operate with an international tribunal being set up by the United
Nations to investigate war crimes in the former Yugoslavia.
'We would not deliver anyone accused of war crimes to this form of justice,'
he said. 'This is an attempt to choose sides and to proclaim one side
guilty.'
Early yesterday the UN Security Council agreed unanimously to establish an
international tribunal to hear charges of war crimes, including ethnic
cleansing, murder, rape and torture in former Yugoslavia.
It will be the first such body since the Nuremburg and Tokyo courts were set
up at the end of the second world war. But unlike those tribunals, the
11-member UN court will not be empowered to impose death sentences.
While it will sit in The Hague, home of the international court of justice,
the tribunal is expected to hear cases in countries closer to former
Yugoslavia.
Bringing the accused to justice may not be easy and it is likely to be some
time before the first case is heard. A commission set up by the Security
Council is collecting evidence of atrocities. Serbs, Bosnians and Croats
have all been accused of violations of international humanitarian law.
Meanwhile, in Sarajevo yesterday Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, international
mediator on Bosnia, held talks in an attempt to persuade the Moslem-led
Bosnian government to accept the Washington accord to contain the fighting.
.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Moslem president of Bosnia, rejected the accord,
saying it would allow Bosnian Serbs to keep territory they seized.
In London, Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, yesterday said the
Vance-Owen plan for Bosnia was not 'immutable' and that it could probably
not be brought about 'in one giant step'.

<TEXT>
THE LEADERS of the Russian Federation's constituent republics will use their
support for President Boris Yeltsin's proposed new constitution as a
bargaining chip to secure greater access to tax revenues and export
earnings, it emerged yesterday.
Mr Yeltsin told a meeting of republican chiefs yesterday that the new
constitution would limit the powers of the centre, giving republics more
rights but also more responsibilities. His spokesman said republican leaders
had signed up to a gentleman's agreement not to alter significantly the
president's constitutional draft.
In a related move the 21 republics - Chechnya was the only one to stay away
 -plan to meet next month to agree measures to implement a new federation
treaty in parallel to a constitutional convention, which opens on June 5 to
adopt the new constitution.
Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister, said the president would
soon publish a decree on ways of implementing the federal treaty, including
details of revenue sharing responsibilities between the regions and the
centre. The treaty was signed last year but Russia's 89 republics and
regions have complained that it has not been implemented.
A federation treaty is badly needed to give the state a more orderly
structure, but part of the problem in implementing it has been very
different concepts of what would constitute a fair division of power and
wealth with Moscow.
Mr Yeltsin will have to balance the interests of poorer regions which need
central government subsidies, while retaining enough control over economic
policy to push through reforms.

PRIVATISATION of Russia's small and medium-sized enterprises has been
disappointing in terms of its effects on companies' management structures
and business operations, according to a report issued yesterday under the
auspices of the UK Treasury.
The report, compiled by KPMG Management Consultancy and Heriot-Watt
University, says 46,000 medium-sized enterprises had been officially
privatised by January of this year, including 6 per cent of Russia's shops
and 5 per cent of its restaurants.
But the report's authors discovered that the act of privatising a company
had, in most cases, amounted to little more than a technical liberation from
state control. The report says privatised enterprises retained the same
management structures and personnel as had existed under the Soviet regime,
and indulged in little new investment or restructuring.
Most work collectives opted for sale of shares in a joint-stock company,
with 51 per cent control going to management and employees. But surveying
enterprises in Moscow, Volgograd and Nizhny Novgorod researchers discovered
that workers and management did not use this as an opportunity for change.
'The prevailing attitude was one of defending the status quo, particularly
employment and welfare provisions.'

<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, yesterday made his
boldest attempt this year to relaunch the European Community's drive towards
deeper political and economic union.
In a speech to the European parliament he urged the EC to press ahead with
the next phase of economic and monetary union and the streamlining of
decision-making powers, now that the Danish had voted in favour of the
Maastricht treaty on European union.
Mr Delors criticised the 'beggar-my-neighbour' policy of competitive
devaluation of individual currencies, and urged the EC to support the
putative single European currency, the Ecu, which remained 'a sad orphan'.
'We must try to recover the euphoria which was evident at the birth of the
Community and was still alive until very recently,' said Mr Delors, who has
been keeping a comparatively low profile for the last year. Mr Delors said
he was still deeply concerned by the grave economic crisis in Europe, and
the situation in the former Yugoslav republics, but in political terms 'the
train is back on the tracks'.
The Commission president also ended the year-old taboo on discussion of
institutional reform of the Community by saying it was time to draw up a
'blueprint for a greater Europe'.
Last year's vote against Maastricht in the first Danish referendum was
partly blamed on fears that EC decision-making would be amended once new
members joined the Community, in order to limit the use of national vetoes.
Mr Delors said yesterday that the EC would be 'groping in the dark' if it
pressed on with the admission of Finland, Norway, Sweden and Austria,
members of the European Free Trade Association (Efta), without considering
how a greater Europe would work. 'We must have a Community which is
political, efficient in its decision-making and which can constantly deepen
its own sense of unity,' he said.
Mr Delors said discussion on the shape of a future European union could
'start today', a rebuff to the British view that reforms will have to wait
until after enlargement of the EC. Mr John Major, the British prime
minister, has said the EC should have the new members in place before any
further consideration is given to institutional change.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Balladur staves off rift in coalition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FRENCH Prime Minister Edouard Balladur appeared yesterday to have
forestalled, with his latest job-boosting plan, the first serious rift in
his ruling coalition.
The prime minister, an RPR Gaullist, had come under criticism from Mr Valery
Giscard d'Estaing, president of the UDF centre-right party, for introducing
too much austerity in his May 10 budget.
In particular, the former French president, who is not in the RPR-UDF
coalition government but who is a contender for the presidency in 1995,
tried to swing the UDF against Mr Balladur's proposal to increase the
controversial CSG tax, a supplementary income tax hitting unearned as well
as earned income, on July 1. Mr Giscard d'Estaing said the tax increase
should be delayed until next year.
But Mr Balladur's announcement on Tuesday of a FFr40bn (Pounds 4.73bn) state
loan, most of which will be spent on preserving jobs and accelerating
housing and infrastructure, appeared yesterday to have silenced Mr Giscard
d'Estaing. Mr Bernard Bosson, the UDF transport minister, disowned his party
leader's criticism, expressing regret that most of the blows against the
government should have come from within.
Yet, with presidential elections less than two years away, the prime
minister runs a growing risk of being sniped at the two most likely
presidential contenders - Mr Giscard d'Estaing and Mr Jacques Chirac.
Criticism from the Socialists of Mr Balladur's change of emphasis towards
measures to create jobs has been muted by the fact that the prime minister
is now vigorously pursuing some of their policies. Not only is he providing
funding for 200,000 more places in Socialist-created work schemes, but his
labour minister, Mr Michel Giraud, said yesterday that he would implement a
law on redundancy procedures, passed by the Socialist government last
December and criticised then by conservatives.
Commenting on Mr Balladur's proposal for a wage subsidy, Les Echos newspaper
yesterday said that the government would have been critical if it had been
applied by its predecessor. In cases where employees have agreed to take a
wage cut in order to ward off the threat of layoffs, Mr Balladur has said
the state will step in 'temporarily' to make up the shortfall in wages.

<TEXT>
THE GERMAN government is considering politically explosive cuts in welfare
payments such as unemployment benefit, and a new delay in the German
government's move to Berlin, because of the need to make drastic savings in
its budget.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, has confirmed that the stormy issue of
when and how the government moves to Berlin is under question once again, as
he seeks to cut DM20bn (Pounds 7.9bn) a year out of his spending plans for
the next three years.
The government is considering delaying the start of any new government
buildings in Berlin to 2000, instead of 1994 as planned.
He is also putting back on the agenda a series of social spending cuts
furiously opposed by the opposition Social Democrats and trade unions.
The plan is to freeze most spending next year. This could mean no pay rises
for civil servants.
Other targets on the hit list - needed just to keep the central government
budget deficit down to DM70bn a year - include further cuts in defence
spending, transport (including rail reform plans) and subsidies for German
emigrants returning from Russia and eastern Europe.
Top of the cuts is unemployment benefit, with a reduction of 3 per cent
proposed. That would save DM3bn a year. A similar cut in support for workers
undergoing retraining - many of them in the former East Germany - would save
another DM2bn.
An increase in unemployment insurance contributions by 0.5 per cent, instead
of a planned decrease, could bring in an extra DM8.4bn a year.
The threatened delay in the move to Berlin has already unleashed a
predictable backlash from the pro-Berlin lobby, fearful that the delay could
become indefinite.
Yet given the narrow parliamentary majority for the move in the first place,
it could prove a popular compromise.
Cuts in social spending are acutely sensitive, and could founder on the
Social Democrats' majority in the upper house, the Bundesrat.
Other possible savings include postponing increases in student grants and
cutting the allowance for second children.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is throwing his weight behind the savings plan,
has promised that pensions benefits will not be affected. But it is thought
pensions contributions will have to go up in 1994, by as much as 2
percentage points.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Shareholders condemn Steinkuhler
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER

<DATELINE>
   STUTTGART
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FULL might of the German financial establishment yesterday united to
condemn Mr Franz Steinkuhler for the share dealing that led him to resign as
leader of Germany's most powerful union, IG Metall.
At the annual meeting of Daimler-Benz, where Mr Steinkuhler is a supervisory
board member, Germany's biggest bank described his share trading as 'totally
unacceptable' and 'massively lacking in sensitivity with regard to the
problems of insider trading'.
Mr Wolfram Freudenberg of Deutsche Bank, the biggest shareholder in
Daimler-Benz, said the union leader did not have inside information when he
bought nearly DM1m (Pounds 300,000) of shares in Mercedes Holding (MAH), a
Daimler holding company, in the weeks leading up to Daimler's supervisory
board meeting on April 2. The information about the proposed dissolution of
MAH - which led to a sharp rise in the share price from which Mr Steinkuhler
benefited - was only known by a few, and not by the union leader.
However, Mr Freudenberg said that Mr Steinkuhler had received confidential
information about Daimler on March 25. 'It is totally unacceptable that a
member of the supervisory board should have dealt in MAH shares under such
circumstances,' he said. 'In the interest of both the company and Germany as
a financial centre, we simply cannot put up with this sort of thing.'
The criticism was echoed by Mr Hans-Joachim Fonk, one of the two directors
of MAH, which owns a 25 per cent stake in Daimler. MAH and Deutsche Bank
said they would not vote to approve the reappointment of Mr Steinkuhler to
the Daimler supervisory board. Although he was a trade union official, Mr
Steinkuhler's position on the board was held in a personal capacity. He has
not yet offered to resign, but is unlikely to stay.
The circumstances surrounding the MAH announcement are being investigated by
the Insider Commission of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Mr Edzard Reuter,
Daimler's chief executive said the information had been released to the
market in a proper way.
IG Metall yesterday confirmed that Mr Steinkuhler had owned shares in AEG,
the electrical group now owned by Daimler, in 1985. The union leader had
denied any such ownership when he was accused last week of having bought
them just before Daimler confirmed its takeover.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday unveiled a job-creation strategy which it
hopes will help halve unemployment in the EC by the end of the century,
writes Andrew Hill.
The EC-wide 'framework for employment', agreed by the Commission at its
meeting in Strasbourg, aims to improve the Community's comparatively poor
record on employment.
The Commission proposes that member states should co-ordinate action, for
example by encouraging employees to adapt to different types of job,
developing new practices - such as job-sharing - and 'investigating the
scope for reducing labour costs'.

FT  27 MAY 93 / It is lonely at the top for Fiat's Agnelli
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ON HIS pedestal as chairman of the Fiat group, Mr Giovanni Agnelli has
become a lonely man.
In recent months, 12 Fiat group executives have been implicated in
allegations concerning illicit payments to Italy's political parties to
obtain contracts and favourable treatment.
Now the investigations have reached just one notch below him - Mr Cesare
Romiti, his faithful long-standing chief executive. Milan magistrates have
placed Mr Romiti on the list of persons officially under investigation.
The Milan magistrates want to cross-check evidence voluntarily provided by
Mr Romiti against testimony of Fiat executives already arrested. The
magistrates are understood to be anxious to check whether Mr Romiti himself
was directly involved in contacts with politicians and to clarify details
about the use by Fiat of overseas funds paid illicitly through a Swiss bank.
The involvement of Mr Romiti - and more directly that of Mr Giorgio Garuzzo
and Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli, respectively the group's chief operating
officer and chief financial officer - raises the awkward question of how
much the chairman himself knew of these illegal transactions.
Within the group, executives say Mr Agnelli was not concerned with the daily
running of the group and its 1,300 companies. As such he was unaware of the
extent of Fiat being a party to the system of bribes until around April this
year. When he did, they say, he immediately went public on April 17 with a
speech at Venice admitting Fiat had erred.
This then led to Mr Romiti's appearence before the Milan magistrates and a
complete volte face in the group's previous stance of non-cooperation with
the judiciary. Fiat also hastily approved a new code of business ethics for
the group.
One of the team of Milan magistrates admitted this week that Fiat's
evidence, combined with that provided by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Olivetti
chairman 10 days ago, has unlocked the main keys to the illicit system of
financing the political parties. This appeared to go some way towards
exonerating Mr Agnelli.
The 72 year-old Fiat chairman is on record as saying that when the first
group executive was arrested in May 1992, Mr Enzo Papi, the managing
director of the construction arm Cogefar-Impresit, he understood this was an
isolated instance with at best one or two other cases.
However, this suggests that there was no attempt to conduct an inquiry at a
senior level until nearly a year later. During this time a number of Fiat
executives had already spent considerable time in jail before agreeing to
talk to the authorities.
It also suggests that Fiat's top management either preferred to ignore the
growing wave of evidence of widespread corruption coming to light from last
autumn onwards, or adopted a policy of sitting tight.
In either case the image of the group has suffered, as has that of both Mr
Romiti and Mr Agnelli. As commentator Massimo Riva wrote yesterday in the
newspaper La Repubblica: 'Dealing with Fiat one writes Cesare Romiti but one
must read in for this Giovanni Agnelli, the man who is the real symbol and
incarnation of economic power, the standard bearer of the Italian industrial
system, the oracle to whom a good part of the country turns to decide the
course of their investments and consumer habits.'
There is indeed the question of why Fiat - through its enormous influence in
Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation, and through Mr Agnelli's
unparalleled prestige and personal contacts as well as ownership of one
national newspaper, La Stampa, and shares in another, Corriere della Serra -
did not denounce earlier a system of bribery which had got out of hand.
The uncomfortable answer would appear to be that Fiat grossly underestimated
the cancer of corruption in the system and at the same time found it
convenient to play along with the extortionate game of the politicians.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Threat to cabinet unity as row over Lamont intensifies:
Momentum builds for early government reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BEHIND-the-scenes battle over Mr Norman Lamont's hold on the Treasury last
night threatened a serious rift in Mr John Major's government.
As political momentum built up for an early cabinet reshuffle, Mr Lamont was
said to be fighting hard to resist the mounting pressure on his position.
Cabinet colleagues said the chancellor was insisting he should not be made
the 'scapegoat' for the government's political difficulties. The implication
was that he would leave the cabinet rather than accept another department.
Mr Lamont, who intends to spend the next few days preparing for the summer
public spending round, was said by friends to have won support on the
Conservative back benches.
But 10 Downing Street declined to quash the wave of speculation at
Westminster that the prime minister was preparing to shake up his
ministerial team. His aides stuck firmly to a 'no com-ment' formula designed
to keep open Mr Major's options.
Senior party figures were said to be making little secret of their
determination that Mr Norman Lamont should be replaced at the Treasury as
soon as possible.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary,
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, and Mr John MacGregor, transport
secretary, were being promoted as replacements for Mr Lamont.
The rift between the chancellor and some of the prime minister's close
associates left Mr Major facing demands from all wings of the party to end
the uncertainty.
Some MPs suggested that a reshuffle could come as early as today but the
consensus among senior ministers was that Mr Major would consider his
options during the Whitsun recess after parliament breaks up today.
Mr Major made it clear this week that he would not be pushed into a
reshuffle by media speculation or by attempts to 'assassinate' cabinet
members. But he is now being warned that the speculation - rife in
ministerial ranks - is destabilising the government.
Sir Norman Fowler, Tory party chairman, last night sought to damp the
speculation with a public though equivocal statement. He told journalists:
'Everyone should just calm down a bit and just allow things to take place.'
The impression of disarray was reinforced when Mr Lamont and Mr MacGregor
offered markedly different assessments of the ultimate goal of the
government's proposals for road pricing. Mr MacGregor was dismayed at the
chancellor's suggestion that motorway charges would lead eventually to
privatisation of sections of the road network.
The appearance of disunity was underlined by an unrelated row between Mr
MacGregor and Mr William Waldegrave, the public services and science
minister.
Mr Waldegrave was furious that a white paper unveiling the first overhaul in
decades of the government's science policy had been overshadowed by Mr
MacGregor's green paper on motorway tolls.
In an interview with the Guardian, Mr Lamont said it was the lot of a
chancellor to be disliked and to 'seem responsible for sinking the Titanic.'
He said he met finance ministers from all over the world, and they were
'deeply unpopular people.' But he said he acted as a useful lightning
conductor for the unpopularity of his party.

FT  27 MAY 93 / Bank of England faces losses of Pounds 115m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England faces losses of Pounds 115m on loans it made in the past
two years to prop up a few financially troubled small banks.
The Bank made the unprecedented disclosure that it had made Pounds 115m
provisions against possible loan losses in its 1993 annual report, published
yesterday.
The report adds that Mr Robin Leigh Pemberton, the Bank's retiring governor,
was awarded remuneration of Pounds 227,000 last year, 15 per cent more than
in the previous year. In both years, Mr Leigh Pemberton has waived his
entitlement to Pounds 34,135 of that.
Mr Leigh Pemberton's pay rise is likely to attract controversy, since the
Bank's performance, especially its supervision of Bank of Credit and
Commerce International, the corrupt international bank, has been much
criticised.
The Bank said yesterday that in the summer of 1991 it organised a rescue of
a handful of small and medium-size banks. Those banks were facing a cash
crisis because financial institutions were withdrawing deposits from them.
After consulting the Treasury, the Bank decided to provide indemnities to
clearing banks that made loans to those small banks. Over the following
year, several hundred million pounds of Bank-guaranteed loans were made to a
few banks, which are believed to have included National Home Loans, the
mortgage bank, and City Merchant Banks, part of fund management group
Invesco MIM.
In total, the Bank kept a close watch on 40 banks that it believed were
vulnerable. It felt that banks with significant exposure to the property
sector were most at risk.
The Bank was concerned that if a series of small banks collapsed, that might
shake confidence in the UK financial system and might prompt big financial
institutions to withdraw deposits from the clearing banks - which might lead
to a banking crisis.
Last autumn, when sterling withdrew from the European exchange rate
mechanism and began to fall, the Bank became convinced that the risk of a
crisis had receded.
However, a number of banks in receipt of Bank-guaranteed loans have run into
serious financial difficulties. As a result, the Bank's accounts for the
year to February 28 contain a Pounds 90m provision to cover possible losses
on the indemnities. In the previous year, it made a hitherto undisclosed
provision of Pounds 25m.
Sir Adrian Cadbury, who chairs the Bank's remuneration committee, said Mr
Leigh Pemberton's pay rise was the culmination of a three-year process to
make Bank salaries more com-petitive with the private sector.
He said executive directors' pay in 1993 had been frozen at last year's
level. Mr Eddie George, who will shortly succeed Mr Leigh Pemberton, is
freezing his pay for five years at Pounds 227,000.
The stock exchange was criticised earlier this week when it was disclosed
that remuneration received by Mr Peter Rawlins, who resigned in March as its
chief executive, rose 28 per cent last year.

THE government faced fresh controversy over its transport policies yesterday
as it set out proposals for a scheme to privatise the motorways. The plan
comes shortly after a close Commons vote in favour of privatising the
railways.
A green paper published by the Department of Transport suggested that the
motorways could be operated profitably by charging users. Car drivers could
face pay-as-you-go tolls of up to 1.5p a mile or an annual fee of up to
Pounds 75.
Private-sector companies could then be invited to compete for franchises to
operate the motorways, using the revenue produced to fund construction of
extra lanes or new roads.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, announced the proposals yesterday,
hours after narrowly surviving a Commons vote on the government's
controversial railway privatisation plans, also based on route franchising.
Mr MacGregor made no mention of motorway privatisation as he launched the
green paper. But Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, was simultaneously
telling a Confederation of British Industry conference on private-sector
funding for infrastructure that charges 'could pave the way for the
privatisation of large parts of Britain's motorway network'.
Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, called the plan 'another poll
tax on wheels' and said the revenues from charges and privatisation would
benefit only the Treasury.
Motoring organisations warned that motorway charges would be acceptable only
if there were guarantees that the money was used for extra spending on
roads.
Mr MacGregor said motorway charges were being proposed because the
government could not afford to finance the construction of enough new roads
to stop existing motorways becoming congested.
He repeatedly emphasised that the government was not committed to any of the
proposals in the green paper. 'I want to stimulate a big public debate,' he
said.
Mr MacGregor said annual permits or electronic tolls were the favoured
options for collecting charges. The former was less satisfactory because it
made a flat charge, Mr MacGregor said, but an electronic system would not be
available until at least 1998.
The green paper suggests that charges for lorries, already taxed more
heavily than almost anywhere else in Europe, would be much higher than those
for cars. The option yielding the most revenue - Pounds 700m a year - would
leave car drivers paying 1.5p a mile or Pounds 75 a year, while lorry
drivers paid 4.5p a mile or up to Pounds 750 a year, depending on the
vehicle's weight.
Many motorists would be unaffected by the charges because fewer than half of
them use the motorways regularly, the green paper says. It also predicts
that charges would result in a diversion of no more than than 10 per cent of
vehicle mileage to secondary roads.
Meanwhile, Mr Lamont told the Confederation of British Industry that there
was 'no limit' to infrastructure projects that could be financed by private
investment.
'From now on, any project which can be paid for from user charges and can
satisfy the normal planning requirements can proceed,' he said. 'If someone
wants to build a road . . . why should the government stand in the way?'

<TEXT>
RWE, the German electricity utility, is to take a stake of between 4 and 5
per cent in Endesa, the state-controlled Spanish generator and distributor.
Endesa recently paid Dollars 217m for a 2 per cent stake in RWE. At current
stock market prices, the RWE share purchase could total Dollars 467m. It
will make RWE the biggest foreign shareholder in a Spanish electricity
group.
The share purchases form part of a wide-ranging agreement between the two
utilities, which are seeking to pool research facilities and develop joint
ventures. Both are heavy users of coal-fired plants.
The agreement between the two utilities was signed last year shortly after
Tractabel of Belgium bought 3 per cent of Iberdrola, the private-sector
Spanish generator which, together with Endesa, controls the bulk of Spain's
domestic electricity market.
Mr Feliciano Fuster, Endesa chairman, said his company had still to decide
on whether to increase its stake in the German utility.

FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Carpetright shows sharp rise to Pounds 7.8m
for year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARPETRIGHT, the carpet company to be floated next month by Sir Philip
Harris, made profits of Pounds 7.81m in the year to May 1 this year.
The pre-tax result, up from Pounds 2.81m last time, was struck on sales 47
per cent higher at Pounds 78.6m (Pounds 53.4m). Operating profits jumped to
Pounds 7.47m (Pounds 2.68m) and operating margins were up from 5 per cent to
9.5 per cent.
The figures were revealed yesterday as Carpetright issued it pathfinder
prospectus ahead of a pricing decision on June 8.
Some 35 per cent of the shares are to be made available to the public. Sir
Philip and companies controlled by him will end up with approximately 20 per
cent of the company and his family will have a further 10 per cent.
Sir Philip confirmed that the flotation would be used to repay preference
share holders. He said the cash generative company would not make
acqsuisitions.
It would, however, consider buying small groups of carpet shops in order to
help it reach its target of increasing the number of outlets from 116 to 200
in the next three years.
County Natwest is sponsoring and underwriting the float while SG Warburg is
broker.

FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Betterware almost doubled to Pounds 13.7m -
Results reflect growth in average orders and doorstep distributors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETTERWARE, the door-to-door household goods distributor whose army of
10,000 self-employed sales people visit over 1m homes each week, has
reported a 94 per cent jump in full year profits.
For the year ended February 27 1993 the pre-tax balance rose from Pounds
7.04m to Pounds 13.7m; that included Pounds 624,000 exceptional gain
compared with Pounds 322,000 charge. Turnover increased 35 per cent to
Pounds 56.3m (Pounds 41.7m).
Cash flow was again strongly positive boosting year-end net cash balances to
Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 4.5m). Some of this will be used to cover the remaining
cost of the group's new Pounds 9.5m UK distribution centre which is on
target for completion by the end of this year.
Mr Andrew Cohen, chief executive, said sales in the core home shopping
business, which employs just 170 people, rose by 52 per cent to Pounds
44.7m. The growth reflected a rise in the average customer order from Pounds
7 to Pounds 8 and an increase in the number of doorstep distributors from
7,000 to 10,000.
The current catalogue contains 450 items ranging from can-openers to drain
cleaner 'priced competitively' with high street hardware stores.
Betterware launched a door-to-door sales operation in France 20 months ago
with a scaled down catalogue of 250 items, and was profitable and ahead of
target in its first year after start-up costs of Pounds 250,000; sales
reached Pounds 750,000. Orders are placed by one in four French homes
visited compared to one in five UK and the average order is worth Pounds 13.
Mr Cohen said the early results from the French operations confirmed the
potential for expanding overseas. The group will start up in Spain this year
and has plans to open up in another unidentified European country in the
following 12 months.
Earnings per share grew by 71 per cent to 8.4p (4.9p) and a final dividend
of 1.5p lifts the total to 2p after the scrip issue (equivalent 1.22p).
COMMENT
Betterware's business may not be glamorous, but Andrew Cohen has certainly
proved that his direct sales formulacan continue to deliver profit gains
even during a recession, provided overheads are kept to a bare minimum and
volumes still rise. Higher volumes generated by more local distributors,
shorter catalogue cycles and overseas expansion translate into greater
purchasing power and continuing healthy margins. Despite this there are no
real direct competitors on the horizon and there are significant barriers to
entry. Betterware has the door-to-door sales business down to a fine art.
Pre-tax profits of around Pounds 17m are likely this year and earnings per
share of about 11p imply a lofty prospective p/e of 24 - the share price has
risen more than five-fold in the last two years and could still go higher.

FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: SGS-Thomson surges to Dollars
24.4m in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian semiconductor maker, yesterday announced a
Dollars 24.4m profit for the first quarter of this year, after a total
profit of Dollars 3m for the whole of 1992.
This is the first quarterly report SGS-Thomson has filed, making comparisons
difficult, but it records a further step in the company's steady turnaround
from the Dollars 102m loss it made in 1991.
At the same time, the French government has clarified its strategy towards
the joint venture, which before last year's capital increase was held 45 per
cent by the French state, 45 per cent by the Italian state, and 10 per cent
by Thorn-EMI of the UK.
Mr Gerard Longuet, France's new industry minister, had created a stir two
weeks ago when he said that SGS-Thomson needed 'industrial partners' rather
than CEA-Industrie, the French nuclear operating agency which the previous
Socialist government brought into SGS.
Mr Longuet still wants big chip-users like Alcatel, the French
telecommunications group, to have a strong influence on SGS-Thomson's
industrial strategy, but not necessarily an equity stake in it.
Indeed he believes that it might even be better to keep private
shareholders, with their inevitable shorter-term financial considerations,
out of the capital of SGS which has to take a longer-run view of
semi-conductor development.
So, along with state-owned France Telecom and Thomson CSF, CEA-Industrie may
keep its equity stake in SGS-Thomson, provided this is kept quite separate
from its nuclear business.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Dams make a desert of north-east Nigeria: Construction of
irrigation projects provides no economic benefit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY RAINS in June have been the signal for generations of farmers,
fishermen and herdsmen of Nigeria's north-east arid zone to prepare for the
annual floods.
But this year around 2m people in Yobe and Borno fear that the floods will
not come. If the federal government carries on building dams in the north,
their traditional way of life and diverse natural habitat face extinction.
Upstream dams near Kano have at least halved the flood water in the
Hadejia-Nguru wetlands and work has begun on a much larger dam at Keffin
Zaki on the Jama'are river in Bauchi state which could turn the fertile
Yobe-Komadougou basin into a desert.
In April last year Dr Bukar Shaib, head of the Federal Environmental
Protection Agency (Fepa), drafted a letter to President Ibrahim Babangida
asking him to halt this project. It contained a proposal to set up a
co-ordinating authority for water resources in the Hadejia-Jama'are-Yobe
river basin.
The letter warned that unless water was 'properly co-ordinated at the
federal level, conflicts will arise between the five states within the basin
and there will be very serious desertification and ecological problems in
Jigawa, Yobe and Borno states.
'Without such co-ordination the EC delegate to Nigeria cannot recommend the
continuation of the North East Arid Zone Development Programme on which the
EC is spending about Dollars 50m in the next five years.'
Dr Shaib cited a report by agricultural experts that 'the Keffin Zaki dam
project should be shelved unless a full and independent study of the
environmental impact of the dam and irrigation schemes downstream proves
their economic benefit to all users.'
The letter was despatched via Mr Abubakar Hashidu, then agriculture
minister, who comes from Bauchi state, but it did not reach the president.
Months later Mr Hashidu awarded the Keffin Zaki dam contract to Julius
Berger Nigeria for an estimated N12bn (Dollars 482m). The decision was taken
without any study of the environmental impact or economic benefits.
Annual floods in the wetlands and Yobe river downstream are vital to the
economy of north-east Nigeria because they re-charge the water supply of the
region up to Lake Chad and provide surface water even in the long dry
season. Yobe and Borno states account for most of Nigeria's livestock,
notably the Fulani cattle.
The flooded areas produce crops all year, of which the most valuable is
rice. Last year operation of the Challawa dam severely reduced the flood,
already lowered by Tiga dam, and nearly all the rice crop failed in the
Hadejia river area.
Fisheries worth about N50m and the trees, reeds and mud used for timber,
fuel and building are dependent on the floods. The wetlands are home to 260
species of birds including many which migrate for the European summer and
part of the area has been made a wildlife sanctuary.
Drought in the 1970s led to a programme of building irrigation dams, which
the government has since pursued despite poor productivity and increasingly
alarming consequences downstream.
Mr Isa Mohammed, the present secretary of state for agriculture responsible
for water resources, declined to discuss the issue.
In the past 20 years the government has invested Dollars 3bn in schemes
which have impounded enough water to irrigate about half a million hectares
and yet only about 70,000 hectares are being irrigated - an overall cost of
Dollars 43,000 to irrigate each hectare. Yet scientists estimate that the
net annual benefits of land use in the natural wetlands are 12 times higher
than on the Kano river irrigation project upstream.
The governors of Yobe and Borno states are seeking an interview with the
president in Abuja to put the case for their region.
'The dam would be a disaster for Yobe and Borno,' according to an adviser to
the governor of Yobe state. 'Keffin Zaki dam would be shallow with a very
high evaporation rate. It is supposed to irrigate 85,000 hectares in Bauchi
state, but they do not need it and the downstream states do.'
The proposed dam would also cut the water supply to the arid zone of
neighbouring Niger along its south-eastern border and reduce the flow into
Lake Chad, which is already drying up fast as a result of dams built in
Cameroon and further south.
The contractors are mobilising on the dam site but construction has not yet
begun. Dr Muhtari Aminu-Kano, director of the Hadejia-Nguru Wetlands
Conservation Project, is working with the Nigeria Conservation Foundation
and other groups to change official policy and remains optimistic.
'But if adequate planning is not done and we do not keep the wetlands wet,
we will lose all the crops, livestock, fish and fuel-wood that have been
produced in this area and people will move en masse to the south. The
question we have to ask ourselves is: can this country cope with that kind
of dislocation?'
As part of its search for debt relief from official creditors, Nigeria has
been advised by the IMF to review projects which contribute little to the
nation's economic revival. The Keffin Zaki dam scheme is arguably a good
place to start.

THE Chinese government has blacklisted 3,000 companies judged to be the
country's worst polluters, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The companies belched out 60 per cent of China's measured industrial waste,
soot and other pollutants, the official news agency Xinhua said.
'If major efforts are made for the control of environmental problems caused
by the 3,000 enterprises, China will be much cleaner,' it said.
Among offenders were big state-run enterprises such as Anshan Iron and Steel
and the Daqing General Industrial Petrochemical Plant. The agency did not
say what action would be taken against companies on the blacklist.
Environmental pollution is a growing problem as China's economy expands,
presenting the government with a dilemma of development versus public
health.

made treatment of the debt-ridden economy the main campaign issue.
Mr Tofa, a bank chairman, said on radio that raising the value of Nigeria's
naira currency would be his priority, if elected. Mr Abiola, a newspaper
tycoon, said on television he could strengthen the currency and turn the
economy round within six months of taking office.
Both candidates pledged to raise the capacity utilisation of cash-strapped
industries, tackle unemployment and reduce Nigeria's heavy debt burden -
vote-catching statements in a nation where most people's living standards
have dropped since the army toppled the country's last civilian government
in 1983.
But economists doubt their programmes will do more to solve basic economic
problems than the military government's free market-oriented Structural
Adjustment Programme.
'Neither candidate has really dealt with the real issues. . . how to curb
corruption, restore local and foreign confidence in the economy and reduce
dependence on imports,' a Lagos-based western banker said.
The incoming civilian government is likely to inherit an economy burdened by
about Dollars 28bn of foreign debts, a weak naira, high inflation and a
population that expects relief from years of austerity.

FT  26 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Mexican textiles bet on Nafta lifeline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MEXICO'S once thriving textile and clothing sectors have been badly hit by
the country's free trade policy.
Cheap imports from South-East Asia and up-market goods from the US and
Europe have devastated the industry, forcing some 300 textile companies to
close since 1988, and putting about 20,000-25,000 workers out of a job.
Now, five years after the trade opening, the Mexican textile and clothes
industry is betting the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) will
reverse its ailing fortunes.
Industrialists are hoping a flood of joint ventures with US competitors,
cheap foreign capital and guaranteed access to the US market will raise
productivity and make the sector more competitive.
Under Nafta, the quota on Mexican textile exports to the US will be
scrapped, while current tariffs of 20 per cent or more will be phased out.
The so-called yarn forward agreement in Nafta means fibres have to be
converted into textiles in Mexico, the US, or Canada to be sold duty-free in
the region, giving Mexico a significant edge over Asian competitors.
Mr Peter Hutchinson, finance director of Alfa, the conglomerate with a joint
venture in fibres with Dupont, says: 'The downstream part of the chain in
textiles and garments is very labour-intensive and thus there is a strong
rationale to have production in Mexico given its comparative advantages
under Nafta.'
However, the transitition may involve a further shake-out in the Mexican
textile industry before it can reap the benefits of Nafta. For every well
capitalised, efficient Mexican textile company, there are still several
others with little money, antiquated machinery and small product lines.
Mr Javier de la Rosa, finance director of Grupo Synkro, Mexico's largest
tights maker, warns: 'The restructuring in the industry is going to
continue, because in general the textile sector has not invested in new
technology and in better fabrics. Obviously it has concentrated just on
survival.' He sees several more years of consolidation in the sector.
Joint ventures make sense because while US companies can offer cheap capital
and knowledge of the US market, the Mexican companies can offer wages a
fifth of the level in the US.
Closeness between Mexico and the US means Mexican factories can respond more
quickly to changes in the US consumer market than Asian competitors.
Cydsa, a petrochemicals to textiles conglomerate, is probably involved in
the largest joint venture to date. It is set to formalise an alliance with
the US textile company Jantzen in the production and commercialisation of 2m
sweaters a year, of which about 85 per cent will be exported.
Jantzen sells the sweaters throughout the US using its established
distribution network and is advising Cydsa on some technical aspects of the
manufacturing process.
Smaller companies are engaging in joint ventures. Mr Jorge Marin, the
37-year-old president of the Garment Business Chamber and head of the
Industrias Extro, is now building a factory in partnership with Hart-Marx, a
US textile maker, to produce 2,000 Oxford trousers a day for export and
domestic markets.

The German federal government, facing sagging revenues and soaring
unemployment costs, will try to trim about DM20bn (Dollars 12.2bn) from its
1994 budget, government sources said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Bonn.
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel announced over the weekend his intention
to seek new savings in the 'double digits of billions of marks,' and sources
said he narrowed this target in yesterday's talks with Chancellor Helmut
Kohl and other leaders of the ruling coalition.
The savings plan is expected to be tied up by mid-July, when the German
cabinet is to present its 1994 draft budget.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Norway boycotted over whaling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO supermarket groups, including Germany's Tengelmann - said to be Europe's
biggest food chain - have announced a boycott of Norwegian food and fish
products in protest against the Oslo government's decision to resume
commercial whaling.
Norway decided last week that it would allow the killing of 296 minke whales
in defiance of an eight-year ban on whaling by the International Whaling
Commission. Of the total, 160 whales were allotted as commercial catch; the
balance for scientific research.
Tengelmann, which has 4,500 food stores, imports Norwegian food and fish
products worth an estimated NKr100m (Dollars 14.3m) annually.
Total German imports of Norwegian products, excluding petroleum, reached
NKr15.9bn in 1992. Of the total, NKr1.4bn represents food products of which
NKr1.26bn is fish, mainly salmon. An executive with the Dusseldorf arm of
the Norwegian Trade Council said Tengelmann stressed it would stick to its
boycott decision until Norway conformed to the IWC ban.
Tengelmann banned imports of food products from Iceland in 1988 when it
resumed commercial whaling and has long been known for its green policies.
The trade council said that Nordsaade, a member of the Unilever group, had
also decided to stop buying Norwegian products from all companies and
suppliers which had either direct or indirect connections to Norwegian
whalers.
The Norwegian government reiterated the argument yesterday that its decision
to resume whaling is based on scientific research and responsible management
of marine resources.
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Norwegian fisheries directorate, which is
responsible for assigning individual whale quotas, said yesterday that 32
boats had qualified for commercial whaling permits, although he added that
not all of the whalers had decided to resume the commercial hunt this year.
They have until June 4 to respond.

FT  26 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SLIGHTLY livelier day in the futures market, following Monday's dull
session, saw trading take place in a tight range, still with very little for
investors to focus on, writes Christopher Price.
The June FT-SE 100 contract opened positively at 2,842 but quickly lost
ground as sellers came in. It settled to trade in a tight 12-point range in
a roller coaster ride during which some good two-way business was
transacted.
The relatively mild reaction to improvement in Britain's GDP figures was
symptomatic, according to dealers, of the general drift in the London market
in recent sessions.
A positive Wall Street helped to push June into higher terrain, although
resistance was being encountered at the 2,843 level. A large order, said to
have originated at the close from Goldman Sachs, sent the June contract to
its high of the day of 2,846, before drifting off in final deals.
June closed at 2,844, around 2 points above its fair value premium of about
5.5. Volume was 6,638 lots, still poor but an improvement from Monday.
In traded options, British Steel was again the busiest stock, reaching 2,700
contracts. It had traded more than 7,000 on Monday. The overall volume
yesterday was 33,643 lots, of which 7,583 were dealt in the FT-SE option. BT
followed with 2,238 contracts transacted, and Rolls-Royce was next with
1,658.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Computer Industry - Systems, Software &amp; Services
(18): Discipline that works - Software methodologies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHIL MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE USE of formal design principles and rigorous management controls for
building applications software has long been a controversial area in
software development. The argument usually revolves around whether to use a
formal software methodology or not.
A methodology - such as the Structured Systems Analysis and Design
Methodology favoured by UK government departments - is a disciplined
engineering approach to designing and building computer software.
Two diametrically-opposed schools of thought on methodologies have emerged:
one argues that a formal approach to design and management is essential to
ensure that the end product is satisfactory; the other argues that what
really matters is the end result and it is not important how it is achieved.
In reality, both groups are right. In some areas rigorous design is
essential. A large-scale corporate network system, which controls the
everyday operations of a company, needs careful thought and is best built
using formal software engineering principles. Infrastructural systems such
as a worldwide fund's transfer system for a bank - or an airline reservation
system - demand a disciplined approach to design and construction.
By contrast, a small-scale departmental information system, which gives its
users a flexible way to get at their data and process it, does not require
the same degree of formal design. A marketing information system for
tracking product sales, for example, is best served by a quick and easy
development method which involves close co-operation with the end-user.
Software methodologies have their origins in what are called 'critical'
systems in areas such as the military and aerospace. Such systems demand
highly predictable systems and robust design and only rigorous methods can
deliver these qualities.
All methodologies start from the idea that software is a product which can
be 'engineered' in the same way as a bridge or a motor car. They lay down
procedures for gathering information about company data and the processes
which transform it. Methodologies also help to enforce good design
principles and management controls. In the last decade, these engineering
design principles used to build 'critical' systems have made the transition
to the commercial sector, where the demand for better quality and greater
flexibility in software has increased.
They have, however, had only limited success and many companies still do not
use formal methodologies - though that does not mean their approach to
software production is not 'methodical'.
'I don't believe there is an organisation without a methodology of one sort
or another,' says Mr Alan Cook, director of product marketing with the
software tools specialist Softlab. 'It might be informal - but they are
using some method to develop software. They have to in today's complex
technology environment.'
The real issue is about discipline in development, says Mr Cook. 'We are
working in an engineering field and that demands discipline - standards and
the like. This means we need somewhere to put information about the system
being developed - a repository or data dictionary, for example. This acts as
a starting point to give you a clear view of the company and its goals.'
Mr John Peyton, European marketing director for Amdahl's Huron development
system, agrees that development discipline is the important issue. 'You need
a way to get the best out people in development - they are, at the same
time, the greatest asset and the weakest link,' he explains.
'But formal methods can act as a barrier between IT staff and users -
something which is not acceptable. This barrier reinforces the idea of 'us'
and 'them' and we need to get away from this.'
There are other problems with formal methods, Mr Peyton points out. 'They
are fine for systems which do not change - the infrastructural, operational
applications, for example. But more and more systems these days must be
flexible. They must be able to produce quick, demonstrable prototypes. Most
methodologies struggle with this.'
The growing sophistication of modern computer systems means that
methodologies will probably apply only to software which is 'under the
covers' where it can make a useful contribution as an engineering
discipline. As far as application development is concerned, however,
methodologies will recede into the infrastructure and tools used to build
software.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Computer Industry - Systems, Software &amp; Services
(16): Benefits beat drawbacks - A look at the trend towards outsourcing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIRTY-FIVE per cent of UK companies now contract out the management of
their computers to a third party, compared with 25 per cent in 1992, says a
survey by CMG Computer Management Group.
Outsourcing may be on the increase, but just how safe and satisfactory is it
for the company's computers? Some consultants urge caution. Ms Judith
Wainwright, of management consultants Pagoda, says: 'While contracting out
information services has proved effective for some, there is a growing body
of experience showing that there are traps for the unwary.'
These traps can include:
Falling quality. The in-house IT department may provide services to the
business on an ad hoc basis, such as working late to help solve problems or
providing informal advice. Such services will be lost if they are not
covered by the outsourcing contract.
Rising costs. This can happen in two ways. First, numbers of in-house IT
staff may rise, perhaps to compensate for falling service levels. According
to Ms Wainwright, this can lead to a number of 'mini-IS departments'.
Second, the supplier may use changing requirements as an opportunity to
improve margins on a captive customer.
Loss of flexibility. Companies choose their outsourcing supplier according
to what their needs are today. Yet their future needs may be very different.
Moreover, there is no guarantee that the supplier's service will develop in
the way a particular customer wants - it has to consider all its customers'
needs, not just one.
Poor security. Many companies fear that their data will not be as secure if
their computers are managed by an outside supplier. However, Mr Paul
Hopkins, sales and marketing director at Sema Group Facilities Management,
says: 'Outsourcing can be just as secure as keeping data in-house, perhaps
more so. Audits, security software and confidentiality agreements all exist
to help here, and contracts can be written which specify financial penalties
if the supplier lets data fall into the wrong hands or security agreements
are breached. Most outsourcing organisations will also let their customers'
auditors check that their security arrangements are satisfactory.'
Lack of control. Some IT activities are critical to the business; if these
are badly managed a company can lose control of its future.
Vote of confidence from users. Despite the potential risks, those who
actually use outsourcing have far fewer doubts about it than non-users. For
example, 50 per cent of non-users surveyed by CMG felt that facilities
management would lead to a loss of control over IT. But only 14 per cent of
users expressed this concern.
Similarly, 48 per cent of non-users thought that the FM supplier would not
understand their business, while only 17 per cent of users identified this
as a concern.
Benefits. In fact, many companies which have opted for outsourcing are
experiencing a number of benefits:
Seventy-seven per cent of users who responded to the survey say that it has
enabled them to concentrate on their core business.
Seventy per cent say that it has helped them to reduce headcount. (The
proportion of outsourcing contracts which involve transferring assets and/or
IT staff to the supplier is increasing.)
Almost half said that it gave them greater financial control over their
operations.
Over half (56 per cent) reported cost savings, while 29 per cent reported no
change in costs. Only 15 per cent of users said their costs had risen as a
result of using FM.
Crossroads FM. Facilities management can also help companies which are
changing IT direction, but need someone to run their existing systems while
they plan the change. For example, when it decided to move away from its
centralised mainframe strategy to smaller IBM systems, Imperial Tobacco
signed a facilities management contract with Hoskyns, the UK computer
services and FM company owned by Cap Gemini Sogeti of France. Mr Robert
Dyrbus, finance director of Imperial Tobacco, reckons that the entire new
installation (completed in 1991) cost just over Pounds 2m, including the
fees paid to Hoskyns. This compares with Imperial Tobacco's 1987-88 DP
budget of Pounds 15m - with Pounds 10m allocated just to run the mainframe.
But Mr Peter Falconer, associate director of Hoskyns, says that as the
market matures, crossroads FM accounts for a smaller proportion of the
company's new business - down to 20 per cent from 60 per cent of new FM
contracts two years ago. He says most companies now sign three-year or
five-year FM contracts because they have made a strategic commitment to
changing the way they manage IT.
Looking for a partner. Another sign of a maturing market is that customers
are getting more demanding. Forty-five per cent told CMG that they would
like to see their outsourcing arrangements turn into a form of partnership.
This is starting to happen. For example, Electronic Data Systems, the
computer services subsidiary of General Motors of the US, has reached
agreement in principle to take over the management of IT at Sweden's KF
co-operative conglomerate. If the deal goes ahead in June, it will be worth
Dollars 1bn over 10 years and involve a form of partnership (or
'co-sourcing') between the two companies.
CMG's research shows that for existing users, the benefits of FM far
outweigh the drawbacks. Nevertheless there were complaints. Over a third of
users say there have been 'difficulties defining the boundaries of
responsibility' and slightly less than a third complain of 'poor management
by the supplier' and 'loss of in-house expertise'.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Computer Industry - Systems, Software &amp; Services
(17): Testing limits of silicon chips - Multimedia: One more milestone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MULTIMEDIA looks set to move from being a niche market to becoming a part of
the mainstream computer industry, writes George Black.
This could give the industry the new lease of life it needs after a
recession. Leading personal computer makers and software package suppliers
are keenly supporting the development of multimedia because they see it as
the best hope of sustaining their growth.
Many users look forward to new applications that combine media such as
word-processed text, CD-ROM (Compact Disk Read Only Memory), graphics,
video, photography and audio.
Banks would like computer files on their customers that include photographs,
signatures and perhaps recorded interviews. Architects, estate agents,
engineers and planners would all like to be able to show their offerings on
a screen, or even to give a guided tour in 'virtual reality' headsets.
There are masses of prospective users in other sectors such as aerospace,
retailing, security, education, the police and television.
The accusation that multimedia is a technology looking for applications
could not be more wrong. But to become universal, multimedia has to come
down in price and bring together several emerging technologies. Although the
principles of the individual technologies have been mastered, getting them
to work together effectively calls for a lot more effort.
The biggest drawback for prospective users in the present economic climate
has been the cost, but the sharp fall in the price of personal computers is
helping. The market may soon reach the point where falling prices and
growing sales create a virtuous circle. The rapid spread of
videoconferencing as a cheaper alternative to air travel is evidence that
where multimedia is cost-effective there are plenty of customers.
The progress of multimedia depends on more processing power. Video and sound
are harder for computers to handle than text and graphics, but users now
expect instant response. The increase in power will come on the desktop
through new chips such as Intel's Pentium, as well as through faster
CD-ROMs, and in larger systems through what is known as 'massively parallel'
hardware.
But hardware makers are struggling to keep up with the demand for power. Mr
Trevor Wing, marketing director for VideoLogic, multimedia products
supplier, says processing video and sound will test the limits of the
silicon chip. Today's advanced workstations labour to process video, he
says. System builders will need to add new hardware to standard chips to
cope with the volume of information in multimedia applications.
The rapidly falling cost of storage is making multimedia applications
commercially feasible, but the capacity of storage devices can barely meet
demand. While PCs have standard hard disks of 80-120 megabytes and standard
CD-ROMs give 500 megabytes, processing the image of a newspaper could use
100 megabytes every day.
Multimedia will also stretch very large database technology. According to Mr
Robert McCord, European development director for database vendor Ingres, the
total volume of data held in databases worldwide could multiply 10 times by
the turn of the century. Whereas data up to now has been measurable in
gigabytes and terabytes, multimedia could need some new unit of volume not
yet in use.
Formidable problems of indexing and retrieval will need to be faced.
Multimedia vendors will be looking for bright ideas from developers of
relational and object-oriented database management systems and hypertext
searching software.
The recent move by Microsoft and Apple to modify their standard operating
systems software so that video, sound and graphics can be incorporated into
programs is seen by the industry as a big step towards creating a mass
market for multimedia.
Before, it was too difficult and expensive for software houses to change the
operating systems to connect them to multimedia applications. Now the
software houses are hard at work to build on the adapted operating systems.
In the next year or two a new generation of software packages should include
presentation systems using sound, video and graphics, aimed mainly at
marketing departments and sales people.
Video quality has to improve; at present postage stamp-sized video windows
give an acceptable image but anything larger tends to lose in smoothness.
The cost is such that there is usually a trade-off between the size and the
quality of the video. Add-in boards for video can be bought for Pounds 300,
which should help the market to grow and make good quality cheaper.
Users will want also higher resolution displays. The PC now delivers 256
colours as an industry standard, which is good enough for many applications,
but others will require even higher, television quality images.
By far the most popular application for multimedia is still training. The
reason for this, says Mr Peter Copeland, chairman of the Sussex-based
training company Futuremedia, is that it is both effective and cheap. Unlike
class instruction, it can be tailored to the individual's needs. A 10-hour
training course might cost Pounds 10,000, but the investment could be
recouped in less than a year, he says.
Standardisation is one of the main needs of the business in the next couple
of years. Microsoft has forged ahead with its own standards, but these may
soon merge with the official standards being developed by the International
Standards Organisation and the Consultative Committee on International
Telephony and Telegraphy.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Computer Industry - Systems, Software &amp; Services
(15): Pen computing is still in its infancy - A look at the prospects for a
market for which estimates vary wildly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR

<TEXT>
WITHIN two to three years, it should become clear whether pen computing can
provide a real alternative to computer keyboard input, at least for portable
computing.
Over the past 18 months the hottest products unveiled at computer trade
fairs and press conferences have been those operated by moving a pen pointer
across a touch-sensitive screen or pad.
Portable computer manufacturers, including industry heavyweights Apple and
IBM, are racing to deliver computers which take their commands from a
cordless stylus-style pen rather than a keyboard.
Some market researchers have predicted that 1m pen computers will be sold by
1995, but the market is in its infancy and the estimates vary wildly.
Mr Jeff Goldburg, Dataquest's mobile computer specialist, describes the
current state of pen computing as 'a lot of hot air and posturing.' It 'is
giving people inflated expectations,' he warns.
He believes that 1995 or 1996 could mark 'a watershed'. By then, he says:
'We will find out whether pen-based machines will come down to a price
people can afford.'
There is no doubt that one reason why sales of pen-based machines have been
slow to take off is cost. Most of the early pen-based tablet computers have
price tags around the Pounds 2,500 level - a substantial premium over the
price of a basic notebook computer with a keyboard - or are hand-held
machines with no big advantages over traditional electronic organisers with
keypads.
Other problems include a lack any software standards in the embryonic pen
computing market, the difficulty of producing software capable of reliably
recognising cursive (joined-up) writing, and the underlying doubt about
whether there are any real applications for the technology.
Aside from the individual proprietary systems used by some manufacturers,
there are at least two rival 'standard' operating systems for pen-input
devices, Microsoft's Windows for Pen Computing, which claims the support of
more than 120 software vendors and Penpoint from GO, a Silicon Valley
company.
In addition, IBM is expected to enter the fray with a version of OS/2 for
pen systems. 'It is really a mess,' says Mr Goldburg, who is nevertheless
betting on Microsoft's Windows for Pen Computing, 'providing they get their
act together.'
Certainly Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, is betting heavily on the
success of pen computing and has said he expects pen computing systems to be
'the next generation of portable computers,' because of their relative ease
of use and accessibility.
Indeed, despite the market's disappointing slow start, most hardware
manufacturers are pressing ahead with plans for pen-based machines and some
have already delivered their first offerings. Among the first pen-based
machines to reach the market were hand-held machines from Poqet, the Fujitsu
subsidiary, and the GRiDPad from Victor Technologies.
NCR, the ATT subsidiary, has already introduced a successor to its original
3125 pen-based machine which was the first system based on Intel's 80386
microprocessor and Toshiba, the notebook computer specialist, has recently
launched its first pen-based offering, the Dynapad T100X.
The Dynapad is a hand-held machine based on an AMD processor with a backlit
LCD screen. It measures 10.6 by 8.3 by 1.5 inches and weighs 3.3lb and is
likely to cost about Pounds 2,500. To circumvent the problem of the lack of
a standard pen-computer operating system, Toshiba offers a 'dual boot'
facility that loads either Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing or the rival
PenPoint 1.01 system developed by GO.
Some manufacturers have gone even further, providing transitional machines
which cater for both pen and keyboard input. For example, both the GRiD
Convertible and AST's PenExec look and work like any other clamshell-type
notebook computer with a keyboard. However, the screen is both a display and
data input device which can be used as a writing surface by the unit's
cordless pen.
In the handheld market Sharp, the Japanese electronics group, has launched
an electronic organiser which for the first time uses pen technology. The
IQ-9000 has a small keyboard and an electronic pen which can be used to
activate the usual functions of an organiser on its touch sensitive screen.
But aside from these hybrids, two basic designs of pen computer have
appeared: the tablet or clipboard and the palm-top. Clipboards are generally
A4 size, weigh about 6lb, and are used just like a conventional pen and
paper clipboard for collecting data or completing pre-defined electronic
forms.
Several companies on both sides of the Atlantic have begun to use clipboard
machines with specialist software or 'vertical applications', to achieve
cost savings in paper-intensive areas. The use of pen computers for this
type of work could well prove a niche market.
But the biggest market share of any emerging pen-based computer market is
expected to go to the hand-held palm-tops, the more sophisticated of which
have been given the name 'personal digital assistants' - although
definitions of exactly what constitutes a PDA vary considerably.
The most eagerly awaited of these is Apple's Newton, which is due to be
launched later this year. Newton, measuring 7in by 4in, will feature a
flip-up lid, an electronic pen which clips onto the side of the casing and
handwriting recognition software.
Amstrad, the UK consumer electronics group, has announced the Pounds 299 Pen
Pad, which it describes as a PDA: it is due to go on sale this month. Other
machines are expected from EO, a US-based joint venture start-up, IBM and
Motorola, Philips and Tandy.
One key limiting factor, however, for all these pen-based machines is the
current state of handwriting recognition software. At present most systems
can just about cope with carefully crafted capitals each entered in its own
box, but are lost when it comes to reading cursive writing - which means
that most typists, even the hunt-and-peck variety, can write more quickly
with a keyboard.
For example, Amstrad's PDA needs to be 'trained' to understand each
individual user's handwriting before it can be converted into text and
stored. Even then, each letter must be entered into its own individual box -
although users will be able to store and recall electronic 'pages' of their
natural handwriting and drawings as well.
Several companies have been working on more sophisticated recognition
software which they claim is able to recognise more than 80 per cent of
cursive script.
A technique called Freeman coding reduces each letter to a set of eight
little arrows, known as vectors. Another system called CalliGrapher,
developed by ParaGraph International, a Russian-American software company,
concentrates on words rather than letters and is claimed to achieve mearly
90 per cent accuracy.
Both systems, however, still require training time, and need expensive and
relatively bulky computing power which is difficult to fit into a hand-held
machine.
But technology could once again eventually come to the rescue, delivering
the low-priced specialised chips - and applications software - which pen
computing probably requires if it is to match the aspirations of those who
believe its time is still to come.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (14): In the shadow of the
deficit - The pound: the good news is confined to the short term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EIGHT MONTHS is a long time in the life of a European currency. From the
turbulent days of September, when sterling was ejected from the exchange
rate mechanism and heavily devalued, the pound is now enjoying a somewhat
brighter - and certainly calmer - outlook.
Over the past two months, sterling has clawed back some of the losses
suffered when it was first left to float on the international foreign
exchange markets.
At its lowest point, reached in February this year, the pound had devalued
by almost 20 per cent from where it stood on the morning of September 16 -
Black Wednesday. But allowing for recent gains, the devaluation amounts to
roughly 13 per cent.
In the short-term, analysts believe prospects for the pound are fairly rosy.
The consensus among 40 analysts earlier this month was that, by the end of
the year, the pound will be at 79.1 on the Bank of England's trade weighted
exchange rate index against a basket of currencies. This compares with the
low of 76.0 reached in February. Against the D-Mark, the consensus sees the
pound at about DM2.60 in the third and fourth quarters.
Sterling is currently benefiting from a perception among investors that,
assuming economic recovery does not falter, interest rates in the UK have
reached their floor.
The view is not shared by everyone. A number of analysts believe the
government will jump to cut rates at the first sign that the recovery is
losing pace. Nonetheless, there is a widespread belief that the next move
for interest rates will be upwards. By contrast, interest rates in the rest
of Europe are headed decisively downwards.
Good economic data is further boosting the pound, at least for the moment.
The past few months have seen a succession of optimistic figures on the
economy, suggesting that the UK is through the worst of its economic woes.
The figures stand out against the bad news coming from Europe's main
economies, in particular Germany where it is sinking into recession.
Underlining the optimism about the pound is a feeling, particularly outside
the UK, that sterling is undervalued.
'On the whole, the general view of overseas investors is that the
devaluation of the pound was just too big,' says Mr Jeremy Hawkins, of Bank
of America in London. 'They complain that the currency is too competitive
now.'
Mr Stephen Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, says: 'Many
investors realise that the pound is a little bit on the cheap side, so from
that point of view, at least against most European currencies, there is some
chance we can push on ahead.'
The good news about the pound, however, is confined mainly to the
short-term. Looking ahead, several developments could hinder sterling's
advance.
The blackest cloud hovering over the pound is the UK's current account
deficit. The financial markets are already anticipating nervously the
publication of first-quarter trade figures next month. The old series of
figures was suspended at the start of the year as a new system for measuring
European Community trade flows was introduced.
Although the Central Statistical Office has warned against deducing trends
from the figures that are available - the non-EC trade figures - traders and
analysts are disconcerted by their poor performance since the beginning of
the year, and are expecting bad news when the EC figures are released.
Apart from the potential shock of the first-quarter trade figures, there is
a more general fear that the current account deficit will deteriorate
sharply over the next two years, putting pressure on the government to
maintain a low pound.
Mr Paul Chertkow, currency analyst at UBS, believes the poor trade balance
will add to pressure on the government to stay out of the European exchange
rate mechanism, so that nothing can get in the way of a policy to ease the
burden of the trade deficit with an aggressively low pound.
Adding to the more cautious long-term outlook for the pound is a general
perception among foreign investors that UK economic policy is adrift.
'You don't take anything on trust from this government, given the chopping
and changing we have seen,' says Mr Hannah.
Mr Chertkow says the perception he picks-up from overseas is one of
considerable scepticism about the economic policy of Mr John Major, the
prime minister.
'There is a general feeling that the UK hasn't solved the Europe problem
yet, and beyond that there is disquiet that the rest of Europe may go ahead
without the UK,' he says.
Another reason to doubt the ability of the pound to recoup its losses in the
long term is that, historically, it has settled at a lower level following
devaluation, as high inflation has whittled away the competitive gains won
through devaluation.
'We have had one of the deepest recessions of any G7 country, and still
there is a question-mark over inflation,' says Mr Hannah, who does not
believe the UK has conquered its attachment to inflation.
'Over 10 to 20 years, it is best to assume that the pound will depreciate,'
he says.
Mr Chertkow takes a similarly gloomy long-term view. UBS's five - year
forecast for sterling sees it at parity with the dollar and at about DM2.00
against the German currency.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (16): Systems prepare for battle
 -Electronic brokerage is on the march - But even bullish project managers
recognise the pitfalls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS AUTUMN, foreign exchange dealers will have to watch their screens more
attentively than ever. The major suppliers of electronic real-time price
information to the market are about to engage in a huge sales war across
their desks.
The battle is to sell computer systems to the banks which simulate the work
currently done by human brokers - and which will do that work a good deal
cheaper.
Around 50 per cent of all FX deals are currently struck in direct
conversations between two counterparties in the interbank market. An
additional 35 per cent of deals are matched by brokers, who bring together
the buyers and sellers in the investment banks.
But, although brokers are extremely skilled and quick at their job, they add
significantly to the transaction costs which banks incur. Brokers charge
commissions, which can be quite considerable for less liquid currencies like
sterling and the French franc. At times of volatility, they can also widen
the spread between the cost of buying and selling currencies, so that they
can make returns.
Electronic matching systems aim to do the same work as the brokers, but at a
reduced cost. As one London-based foreign exchange manager puts: 'With these
new computerised systems, what the dealer sees on the screen is what he
gets.'
But more than one system is coming on to the market, and the battle to sell
them is set to be fierce.
Reuters, which has the largest market share in the provision of real-time
information to financial markets, launched its 2000-2 dealing system in May
of last year. Last month, Minex, a Japanese company, launched its system
which, for the moment, predominantly operates in the Tokyo market.
Later this year, a consortium bringing together the major foreign exchange
banks and the electronic information group, Quotron, is launching an
electronic matching system called Electronic Broking Service (EBS).
The Reuters system might easily have gone unchallenged. The information
group already has a huge hold over communications in the foreign exchange
market through its main dealing systems, Reuters 2000-1 and Reuter Monitor,
with 19,000 dealing terminals around the world. Quotron, which is backing
the EBS project, has only 3,000 of its FX Trader systems world-wide.
However, the launch of 2000-2 was of such concern to foreign exchange
managers at London's leading banks, that a group of them felt that they
needed to launch a rival in the form of EBS.
One fear was that Reuters would be in a position to dictate the nature of
foreign exchange dealing if it could extend its share of transactions to
some 80 per cent of the market.
There are concerns, too, that an increase in Reuters market share could put
it in a position to change the whole structure of FX dealing, if it so
wished.
A growing concentration of the FX business is in the hands of the major
interbank counterparties. According to investors in the EBS system, a key
concern of the banks is that Reuters should not sell its system outside the
non-banking sector.
As one backer of the EBS project puts it: 'If Reuters gained such a powerful
position that it could put its systems in the hands of anyone it wanted, the
interbank market would lose its strong hold on liquidity.'
The battle between EBS and Reuters over automated brokerage will be
particularly intense, because both companies have approached the development
of their systems in different ways.
Reuters spent years developing 2000-2 in laboratories, setting it up live
and then finding customers. 'You must make sure your product works,' says
Bob Etherington, marketing director at Reuters in London. 'At the end of the
day, people will judge your system on reliability, speed and security.'
The EBS consortium is also confident about the technical prowess of the
system it is yet to launch. But Mr Peter Bartko, director of the group, says
the critical advantage of the EBS system is the backing it has from the
dozen or so banks which - together - have a 35 per cent share of the
liquidity in the currency markets.
'You can't be half pregnant in this game,' he says. 'You have to encourage
dealers to use your system, and they will only do that if they can see a
two-way price on the screen with depth. You need a wide audience on day
one.'
Reuters has come under criticism for launching 2000-2 without signing up the
major counterparties as clients. The company is unwilling to reveal detail
on transaction volumes, but there has been criticism of the low level of
trading in the system's first year.
However, Mr Etherington is confident that the system is going from strength
to strength. He says that 183 users have signed up for the system, and
another 118 have contracted to use it, in 17 countries. The daily traffic on
the system is four times higher than it was at the start of the year. At
least one member of the EBS consortium is also thought to have subscribed to
Reuters 2000-2 system already.
'We would like to have the major counterparties, but we still have an
increasing number of the major players in the market,' he says.
Will automated brokerage change the nature of foreign exchange? Even at
their most bullish, the project managers acknowledge the pitfalls.
One of the biggest problems is that automated brokerage systems might be
comparatively slow in inputting prices into a market where every trading
second counts.
Today, when a dealer strikes a price with a broker, the transaction is
completed when he shouts 'done' down the telephone. He is now invited to use
a system in which deals are done in the slightly longer time it takes to
type a message on a typewriter keyboard.
But the earlier Reuters systems proved how technology can - with time -
change the nature of the market. The volatility and profits in FX are as
great as they are today because millions of dollars flow around the world in
a split second.
These funds would flow even more smoothly - and foreign exchange turnover
will be even greater - if a single institution can claim to be the world's
greatest broker.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (15): Recession proves a drag on
the anchor - The D-Mark presents a deceptive picture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Deutsche Mark has strengthened during the past eight months, in keeping
with its status as anchor currency within the European exchange rate
mechanism and 'safe haven' for investors in troubled times.
On a real trade-weighted basis, it has appreciated by 5 per cent since last
summer, having risen from 92.6 in July to 97.1 in April, according to an
index produced by the Bundesbank - inflicting a substantial loss of
competitiveness on the German economy.
The overall picture conceals a loss of value against the US dollar. As
German interest rates have fallen and the economy has slipped into
recession, investors have been attracted to the US currency by the prospect
of economic recovery and higher interest rates. The D-Mark has fallen by 16
per cent since the dollar hit a low point in early September.
It also disguises a steep appreciation against European Community
currencies. Here, the increase to February was closer to 10 per cent,
reflecting the devaluation of the Italian lire and sterling against the
D-Mark. The change will be even steeper after the recent devaluation of the
Portuguese escudo and the Spanish peseta.
Economists predict a change in perceptions of the D-Mark: its value against
the US dollar is set to decline further, and the currency is expected to
lose its relative strength against currencies within the ERM.
'It will be at the bottom end of the ERM grid, if not at the outright
bottom,' says Avinash Persaud, currency economist at the Union Bank of
Switzerland in London.
This reflects two factors: poor fundamentals for the German economy, and a
resurgence of a degree of harmony on foreign exchange markets within Europe.
The attractions of the currency were especially high in the second half of
last year. German interest rates were at very high levels as the Bundesbank
struggled to stifle the inflationary forces unleashed in the aftermath of
German reunification. While the high rates were the cause of currency
turmoil, they also guaranteed the appeal of the D-Mark when other currencies
were subjected to waves of speculative selling on foreign exchange markets.
Now that there have been a number of exchange rate realignments, the
tensions inherent within the ERM have been diffused, thereby removing the
conditions under which the D-mark has 'safe haven' status.
During the current year, the attractions of the D-mark have diminished with
each cut in German interest rates.
Although inflation is at more than twice the Bundesbank's long-term annual
target of 2 per cent, more rate cuts are expected, with the Discount rate
likely to be down to 5 or 6 per cent by the end of the year. Each cut
weakens the appeal of the D-Mark - but the German economy is sinking into
its worst recession since the second world war.
Another disadvantage is that Germany's political establishment has not
provided any concrete solutions to the problem of public-sector debt. Alison
Cottrell, at Midland Global Markets Research in London, calculates that the
total figure this year - including debts associated with the Treuhand, the
government's privatisation agency for the former east Germany, and state-run
industries - could amount to DM231bn, more than 8 per cent of GDP.
Ms Cottrell believes the German government's ability to tackle this issue is
further blunted by the prospect of a crop of regional and federal elections.
She says, however, that the downside risks for the D-mark versus other
European currencies are muted: 'Other countries will cut their rates as
well. In a European context the D-Mark will be soft but stable.' Her
estimate is that the D-Mark could move against sterling to around DM2.55 in
a year's time.
By contrast, Ms Cottrell predicts further weakening against the US dollar.
The extent will depend on the scale of the economic recovery in the US, but
she is predicting a rate of DM1.65 to the dollar in six months time, and
DM1.70 a year from now.
According to Thomas Mayer, chief economist at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt,
there are striking parallels between the development of the German economy
since reunification in 1990 and that of the US in the 1980s under President
Reagan. These point to substantial, if slow, depreciation of the D-Mark
against the dollar.
While Reagan hoped to stimulate a 'supply-side' revolution in the US by
cutting taxes, the elimination of central planning in the east was likewise
expected to induce an economic revolution. Instead, Mr Mayer argues, both
countries got a short-lived demand boom. The result in both cases was high
inflation and fiscal expansion.
'Like the US in the 1980s, Germany is becoming a 'twin-deficit country',' he
contends. 'That is, a country with high and rising public sector as well as
external (trade) deficits. . . In the US (this situation) put downward
pressure on the exchange rate and kept interest rates high during most of
the 1980's. With 'twin deficits' likely for most of the nineties, we expect
the exchange rate of the D-mark to ease and long-term bond yields to rise
from present levels in the intermediate future.'

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Computer Industry - Systems, Software &amp; Services
(11): Big Idea changes software - A look at the enthusiasm for object
orientation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHIL MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a basic law in information technology. When a new 'Big Idea' comes
along its progress follows a predictable pattern: initially, there is
unbridled enthusiasm from the technologists who advocate it; this is
followed by a process of bandwagon building - as supplier companies'
marketing departments recognise the Big Idea's potential as a way to
increase sales.
Finally, there is an inevitable backlash - as the Big Idea fails to live up
to the inflated expectations pushed by the marketeers. Artificial
intelligence, expert systems, computer-aided software engineering and many
other examples have followed the same pattern.
Object-oriented computing - a relatively new way of designing information
technology systems - could be an exception. As a Big Idea, it is approaching
the end of the second phase - with most manufacturers now claiming that they
offer products which may be described as object-oriented. It is time,
therefore, to look for signs of the backlash.
But, so far, there are no signs that the initial enthusiasm for the
object-oriented approach has started to wane. On the contrary, the bandwagon
is rolling along nicely and the first experiences of the genuine application
of the object-oriented approach are beginning to surface. Generally, the
results appear to be positive.
Mr Kerry Williams, an object-oriented technology specialist with the Swiss
Bank, reports significant success with the approach. 'The bank decided to
move to the technology about two years ago and we have delivered about a
dozen applications using it,' he says.
The applications are mainly concerned with the bank's front office
operations and what Mr Williams describes as applications 'which fill the
vacuum between the front and back office'. He is reluctant to be more
specific because the bank is conscious of the competitive advantage that the
new software brings.
There are a growing number of examples of similar successes using the
object-oriented approach. And if the number of conferences on
object-oriented design, scheduled over the next few months, is an indicator,
the level of interest is increasing and what might be termed a 'paradigm
shift' is in the wind.
Academically-minded purists will disagree but the essence of the
object-oriented approach is deceptively simple. It means thinking about
information processing systems as a set of well-defined components which can
interact with each other. Applications can be constructed from these
components in the same way that a child builds a toy from a set of Lego
bricks.
Any part of an IT system can be viewed as an object - from a complete
application like a sales order processing system down to a simple program
code routine to calculate a date. The object-oriented design approach
provides a formal theoretical base with which to define and build objects.
It also fits well with current pre-occupations in IT systems design such as
the client-server architecture and networked systems.
Advocates of the object-oriented approach claim that it makes building IT
applications much easier because software 'objects' can be directly related
to the 'real' world, rather than traditional software design methods which
concentrate on technology issues.
If successful, the object-oriented approach has profound implications for
the future of software and IT systems in general.
One of the main advantages of object components is that they can be used by
many different applications. This means that a program to prepare data for a
Postscript laser printer can be used by many applications. This technique is
widely used in personal computers which use Microsoft's Windows environment.
Similarly, the same 'spelling checker' program or object can be used by a
word processing package, a spreadsheet and a presentation package.
Inevitably, this means that it becomes more difficult to define exactly what
an 'application' is. Is it a complete 'solution' with all of the program
code required to perform the task 'built in'? Or is it a set of objects
which are brought together to perform the task as required?
A recent paper prepared by the Object Management Group (OMG), an industry
organisation set up to promote object-oriented technology, suggests that
future software applications will conform to the latter model. It uses the
concept of 'electronic brokerage' of software components - akin to the Stock
Exchange - as its starting point: 'We see this affecting software developers
in the first instance. They are looking for ways to put new software
products together by leveraging existing applications,' explains Mr Richard
Soley, technical director of OMG and co-author of the paper.
'An electronic brokerage system would allow them to 'discover' what objects
are available and what they can do. By delivering them electronically or
with CD-ROM, they can assess whether the software is suited to their
purpose.'
Mr Soley says that this has significant implications for software
distribution channels.
'It means that you can distribute software to a mass market with very few
overheads. It also means users can benefit from being able to choose from a
variety of different component objects to suit their needs.'
Such a system does, of course, assume a standard infrastructure to support
software components. The OMG says it is well on the way to building this
infrastructure and has been remarkably successful in persuading the IT
industry to adopt common standards.
'You will see brokerage-type operations beginning to emerge this year and,
within two years, end-user companies will see the effects,' says Mr Soley.
If this forecast is correct, then the Big Idea behind object-oriented
technology could be the one exception that proves the rule.

(14): The user-friendly service - Client-server computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Abbey National is a building society turned bank with 700 branches and
12,000 PCs. The branches service a wide variety of customer needs, and the
PC network is the route that Abbey National uses to meet those needs.
Since 1987, Abbey National has invested Pounds 100m a year in IT, with the
aim of bringing all its computer resources to bear on that network. Its
strategy is client-server computing. Using powerful host computers to back
up rings of PCs, each branch offers Abbey National counter staff a variety
of programs with a common interface.
Staff learn only how to work with one system. Whatever new function they
move to within the branch the software remains familiar. This leaves them
ready to cope with any request from a customer.
Mr Mac Millington is director of retail banking systems at Abbey National.
He believes that the key to client-server computing lies in the ability of
software to bundle together different functions. His PCs are linked through
the local host computer to the entire national network. So the ultimate
hosts are a bewildering array of large mainframe processors.
Mr Millington emphasises that in the client-server scheme of things these
systems are no more than large servers. 'True client-server computing comes
about when it all looks the same to the end-user. Most cashiers wouldn't
know which mainframe the data is on - and they don't need to. That's the job
of our IT people.'
He relies on Olivetti for the thousands of PCs and the software that binds
those terminals to the hosts and the bank's entire network. 'The key is to
glue all the applications together so what the user sees is one homogeneous
system. That's why we chose this Personal for Banking suite of software.
Olivetti understands the key is to make the whole structure transparent to
the user.'
becomes apparent as Mr Millington reels off the list of mainframe and core
system suppliers that Abbey National uses.
Large systems from Unisys, IBM, Amdahl, Stratus and Teradata all feature in
the bank's IT arsenal. These can store and transmit huge quantities of data,
but if the communications link between central computer sites and the
branches fails, the local operations can continue relying on branch hosts.
Each branch server has a link to 'foreign' hosts, providing external data
feeds such as Prestel services.
Mr Millington regards this durability as a critical aspect of client-server
operations. 'This allows us to give the service we want. If the host line is
down the branch can still keep up with customer queries because the client
software is at the front end.'
The arrival of the powerful 386-based PCs that Abbey National uses was
crucial to the client-server philosophy. Networks of dumb terminals,
providing whatever programs a mid-sized 32-bit processor or large mainframe
could store and transmit, were the standard manner of distributing an
institution's data. This set-up became obsolete as the PC began to outstrip
the old generation of mid-range computers. Once technology could offer local
intelligence, the client level of the operation took on a new value.
Abbey National staff no longer have to sign off and on when moving from
mortgages to personal banking. The common interface generated by the PB
software and supported by the processing power of the client PC keeps every
service in the one environment. The applications reside on the client PC
while the server, again a PC but dedicated to one task, holds all the branch
data.
In the old, mainframe-driven view of the world, the end-user was out on the
edge. Now client-server computing has brought the user and his applications
into the centre of things, with every other device, right up to mainframes,
regarded as a necessary peripheral. With software development focused on
aiding counter staff, client-server computing should give the consumer a
quicker and cleaner service.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Computer Industry - Systems, Software &amp; Services
(12): Rival threatens Unix - Open systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHIL MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE their long history, open systems are only now becoming a meaningful
reality. The trap of closed proprietary systems, which held most large
computer users in thrall for three decades, is finally fading to be replaced
by a freer, more flexible world of open systems, writes Phil Manchester.
In March this year an important group of leading computer manufacturers and
software developers announced its intention to put differences on one side
and co-operate in devising a Common Open Software Environment (Cose).
Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Santa Cruz Operation, Sunsoft, Univel and Unix Systems
Laboratories agreed to work towards a Cose 'standard' based on the Unix
operating system.
Cose aims to define broad standards for desktop user interfaces, graphics,
networking, multimedia computing and systems management. Theoretically, any
Unix software developed by the Cose companies will be able to run on the
other member companies' platforms.
But there were two notable absentees from the initiative. Microsoft - which
is working on a rival operating environment based on its Windows software -
was not invited and neither was Apple.
The Cose announcement is the latest in a succession of alliances aimed at
promoting a single software environment for the computer industry - a factor
which has led the move to be viewed with some cynicism by commentators and
users. IBM and HP were already working together within the Open Software
Foundation, an alliance set up in the late 1980s to promote their respective
'flavours' of Unix.
OSF was established in competition with AT&amp;T, the originator of Unix, which
was promoting its own standards under an alliance called Unix International.
Its members included USL (now part of Novell) and Sun Microsystems -
Sunsoft's parent company.
The two rival groupings have been moving together for two or three years -
with Unix International adopting several OSF-sponsored standards and vice
versa.
The Cose standard, therefore, is a ratification of a process which was
already well under way.
The movement towards open systems began in the early 1980s, when many
companies noticed that their ability to take advantage of information
technology advances was constrained by the inertia of their investment
applications based on single manufacturer systems. If they were dissatisfied
with their hardware supplier, there was little they could do about it. They
either threw everything away and started again or they continued to dig
themselves deeper into the proprietary systems hole.
The advent of personal computing served to highlight the disadvantages of a
fragmented market. The quick acceptance of the IBM/MS/DOS personal computer
boosted the market and gave manufacturers and software developers a common
technology to build on.
More important, it meant that customers could - to a large extent - rely on
compatibility across different manufacturers' systems. At the same time, it
brought software prices down because development costs could be amortised
across a much large market. Much of the activity in open systems over the
last two or three years has been aimed at extending the idea of a common
open standard to large computer systems.
Mr Bernard Guidon, European marketing manager for Hewlett-Packard and a key
participant in the Cose discussions, says that the move was a response to
pressure from customers: 'Large global companies have systems from many
different manufacturers and want their applications software to be
consistent across different hardware,' he explains.
'If we want the Unix market to grow - then we need to get our act together
and come up with a common Unix.'
He adds that it was surprisingly easy to get technicians from the various
Cose members to devise a set of standards on which everyone could agree.
'We told them not to look at what they had done in the past - but to work on
the best technology for the future.'
The simple fact that all of the participants were already working with the
Unix operating system - despite small, annoying differences between the
different versions - made things easier.
Unix has been synonymous with open systems since the mid-1980s when it was
widely adopted by leading manufacturers as a way to offer a common platform
to build applications on.
But there is a growing school of thought which runs against Unix -
particularly with the increased dominance of Microsoft in the operating
systems market. About 200m personal computers around the world use Microsoft
operating software - either in the form of MS/DOS or the more recent Windows
environment. Microsoft hopes that they will move on to its Windows NT
environment - once it becomes established. Windows NT offers many of the
features which have made Unix attractive as the foundation for larger
computer systems.
Microsoft has good reason to feel confident that it will prevail. Software
application developers are strongly committed to re-developing their
products to work under Windows NT and many users will be looking for a
smooth upward migration path from their current personal computer systems.
But Mr Guidon is also optimistic. He expects Microsoft will be forced to
move closer to Cose standards. 'Large companies will put pressure on
Microsoft to conform in the long term,' he predicts.

(13): Myth of the panacea interface - Human machine interaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY QUINN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVER since someone connected a television screen to a computer, the search
has been on for a computer that is easier to use. The major development of
the past decade has been the launch of the 'user friendly' Apple Macintosh.
The use of a mouse to control a 'desktop' has since spread to IBM-compatible
PCs in the form of Microsoft's Windows.
Each succeeding generation of microprocessor has brought the interface
between machine and man that much closer. The launch of the latest portable
computers - personal digital assistants - has introduced a new challenge to
the desktop, that of the notebook and pen.
PDAs such as E0's Communicator and Apple's Newton have no keyboard. Instead,
you write on the screen and the handwriting is translated into neat computer
text. Mr Hermann Hauser, chairman of EO Europe, describes the Communicator
as an 'active book'. The philosophy, he explains, 'uses the metaphor of the
book. The page itself is an effective unit of information; it is numbered
and grouped into chapters.
'Using the Communicator is just like using a notepad. It is like a hook
because it can present a lot of information without your having to input
anything. The active part comes from being able to edit and reformat the
information. Also, you can link parts together using a hyper-text system and
use multimedia with voice annotation and video.'
The Communicator screen looks like a notepad and has a 'book shelf' along
the bottom. Pages are 'turned' by touching the screen with the pen to the
left or right.
Mr Hauser compares the idea to the Macintosh. 'The Apple desktop metaphor is
successful and now it is 10 years old. It is good for the work it does, but
the book opens up to more people and is easier to use. For example, there is
no loading and saving of files. Instead, you go to part of the book. Saving
still goes on, but it is hidden from the user.'
But the pen has its limitations. Mr Charles Brennan, chairman of the British
Computer Society's interest group on human computer interaction, comments:
'The use of pens is touted by some as an improvement, but it's really a
solution to the fact that you can't fit a keyboard on a small portable. It
introduces as many difficulties as it solves.'
One problem is how to represent the volumes of data which computers can
access. One compact disc can store 600 times as much information as a floppy
disc, enough for a thousand novels. 'The book metaphor doesn't solve that,
nor does the desktop,' says Mr Brennan. 'You have to go beyond the real
world. You cannot look at a library and know where to go - you have to use
the computer as a support system.'
Researchers are already using virtual reality techniques to represent large
amounts of information as three-dimensional spaces. For example, the human
brain can be modelled as a structure for doctors and then 'flown around'
with heat or light used to highlight areas of inflammation.
As well as looking for new designs, work is concentrating on methodology and
standards. There are three major strands to this.
The first strand is building in 'usability'. Mr Paul Seaton of System
Concepts in London has worked on this under a project partly funded by the
DTI. 'At present, a lot of bespoke system development for big corporates is
done in-house. The development kits are promoted as being able to do the
whole job, but there's a lot more to it. Psychology and ergonomics are
concepts which are alien to these people. Companies such as Microsoft and
Apple recognise this, but in-house developers don't'
Existing system design methodologies leave the human interface to last, he
adds. 'You must move away from the technology and support the task, not
impose extra complications such as codes and jumping between screens to do
something that can be done on a single sheet of paper.'
The second strand is finding ways of assessing usability. Mr Martin Maguire
of the Husat Institute at Loughborough University says researchers there
have adopted four criteria:
User performance: usually measured by the time taken to carry out a task;
User satisfaction: responses to a questionnaire produce scores for
efficiency, control, learning, helpfulness and satisfaction;
Cognitive workload: breathing and heart rates are taken to measure stress
and mental effort. This is particularly important for safety-critical
systems, such as for air traffic control;
Analytic: a computer model of the user interface and tasks is built to see
how well the system performs. This can be done without the need for user
trials.
These measures would be applied by software developers, or by companies
commissioning software as a way of testing performance.
The third strand is the establishment of formal standards and trying to tie
in usability to open systems and total quality management. A European
directive which came into force this year (90/270/EEC) already contains
requirements relating to usability. Also, a working group is developing an
international standard (ISO 9241) dealing with software ergonomics and the
man-machine interface.
Ultimately, however, software developers have to work harder to understand
people. 'You can't solve usability by a panacea interface,' says Mr Brennan.
'You need to approach the big picture; recognise the organisational aspects,
the way people work and address the tasks that need to be done.'

information centre was set up on ergonomic issues. Contact Richard Wilson,

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (13): The yen's role in east Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE strengthening of the yen gathered momentum last month, the cries of
anguish from Japanese politicians and executives suggested that the currency
is close to the pain threshold for companies which have successfully endured
a decade of appreciation.
The past decade has also been characterised by appreciating expectations
that the yen will play an important role in international markets, but those
forecasts are in need of review with the collapse of the financial 'bubble',
pumped ever larger during the easy-money era of the late 1980s.
Japanese direct investment has fallen sharply, while the country's banks,
troubled by a mounting pile of non-performing loans, are wary of new lending
to international customers. At the same time, the Japanese corporate focus
is still firmly fixed on the traditional measure, the yen-dollar exchange
rate, as 83 per cent of import contracts and 60 per cent of export contracts
were denominated in dollars last year.
But Japanese interest and investment in east Asia remains strong.
Manufacturers are relocating factories to cut costs, and companies generally
expect strong growth from the region's economies, particularly China, in
contrast to their expectations of a weak recovery in the US and difficult
times ahead in Europe.
The emphasis on Asia is becoming increasingly apparent. Asian markets
accounted for 41 per cent of total trade last year, while north America
accounted for 30 per cent - five years ago, both regions were equal at 35
per cent. The Bank of Tokyo estimates that yen-denominated imports rose
almost 50 per cent over the past five years, due to 'a relative increase in
trade with east and south-east Asia, where the share of yen-denominated
transactions has traditionally been high'.
But it was to Washington that Tokyo turned in April, when the yen hovered
around Y110 to the dollar and Japanese executives feared that the Y100 mark
would be tested in the following weeks. The currency had appreciated 10 per
cent in just over two months, prompting the Bank of Japan to intervene and
Japanese politicians to warn about foreign exchange 'instability'.
By 'instability', the politicians meant tougher conditions for Japanese
export industries, but they thought it inappropriate to plead to the US on
behalf of a sector blamed for fuelling the bilateral trade surplus. The
Japanese government also felt some justification because it considered
President Clinton's apparent support for a strong yen partly responsible for
the 'instability'.
Japan's Economic Planning Agency calculates that a 10 per cent yen
appreciation, in theory, creates a 0.48 per cent contraction in gross
national product. But the EPA also estimates that the change leads to a 1.3
per cent fall in consumer prices, presumably stimulating final consumption,
which has been unusually weak in recent months.
The full benefits of a stronger yen are denied to Japanese companies,
because of the reluctance of the energy sector, which imports most of its
resources, to pass on the savings to consumers. Oil companies have announced
a 0.5 per cent trimming of prices at the petrol pump, but other industries
have yet to make similar reductions, arguing that raw materials costs have
risen over the past year.
Yen appreciation is another good reason for Japanese manufacturers to
relaunch restructuring programmes begun after the currency's sharp rise in
the mid-1980s, inspired by the Plaza Accord in September 1985. The Y110
level, where the currency has settled in recent weeks, should not pose
unexpected threats to these companies, as the dollar rate hit Y120.45 six
years ago.
But the present bout of appreciation comes as the manufacturing sector is
recovering from a serious case of over-capacity, brought on by a rapid
expansion in Japan-based factories during the late 1980s, when capital was
relatively cheap and the yen was relatively weak, distorting these
companies' projections for return on investment.
Manufacturers are being forced to look to cheaper production facilities in
China, Malaysia and Vietnam, which will spread the regional influence of the
yen. During April, Suzuki Motor, Aiwa, the audio equipment maker, and YKK,
the zipper manufacturer, announced new production facilities in east Asia.
A related trend strengthening the yen's role in east Asia is a surge in
re-imports, products made abroad by Japanese companies and sold in the
domestic market, which have increased at an annual rate of 20 per cent over
the past five years.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (11): The markets remain wary -
President Clinton's problems are hurting the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT A time when the new US president should be enjoying the political
honeymoon afforded to all new White House occupants, and aggressively
pushing his new policies through Congress, Mr Clinton's economic reforms are
in jeopardy.
His stock with the financial markets, the business community, the media, and
even the public, is also falling fast.
Not surprisingly, the president's problems have hurt the dollar. The Federal
Reserve may have recently intervened on its behalf, but the currency remains
near all-time lows against the yen, and only a few pfennigs above where it
started the year against the D-Mark, in spite of declining German interest
rates and a rapidly weakening German economy.
The economy has slowed down from the strong rates of growth seen at the end
of 1992. After expanding by 4.7 per cent in the final three months of last
year, gross domestic product grew by only 1.8 per cent in the first quarter
of this year.
Judging by a host of recent indicators, second-quarter growth is not likely
to rebound strongly, either. Concern about the economic outlook has reached
a point where analysts have begun warning that the Federal Reserve may have
to cut interest rates once more.
While the economy has stumbled, so has President Clinton, whose political
fortunes have nose-dived since the euphoria surrounding his first few weeks
in office.
He has also been rapidly losing the confidence of the public, who appear
unhappy about his planned tax increases and worried by the president's lack
of legislative success. A politically insecure president is never good for
the dollar, least of all one who is struggling during the opening months of
his first term.
To make matters worse, in recent months the Clinton administration has given
the foreign exchange markets the impression that it favours a weak dollar
against the yen, apparently in the hope that this would help to narrow the
US trade gap with Japan. The impression was first formed in February, when
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, spoke in support of a stronger
yen before reporters at the National Press Club.
Within days, that impression had crystallised after Mr Clinton, at a meeting
with Japanese prime minister Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, said that he expected the
US trade deficit with Japan to shrink because of the weakening dollar/yen
rate. Not surprisingly, foreign exchange dealers took this as an excuse to
sell the former and buy the latter, lowering the exchange rate from Y125 at
the start of the year to Y110.
Since then, it has barely budged, in spite of central bank intervention and
a policy reversal (of sorts) by the administration.
Under pressure from Tokyo, which worries that the strong yen will hurt
Japanese exports at a time when the domestic economy is in a slump, Mr
Bentsen explained that there had been some 'misperceptions' about the
government's stance on the dollar. He did not expressly say that he now
favoured a stronger dollar against the yen, but he warned that the
government stood ready to fight 'excessive volatility' in the markets. To
some observers, the whole episode underlined President Clinton's naivety
when it comes to handling issues of global finance.
Against the D-Mark, meanwhile, the US currency has remained relatively weak,
primarily because recent gradual and modest reductions in German interest
rates have not been enough to significantly narrow the differential between
US and German rates. What is more, hopes that the US Federal Reserve might
start tightening monetary policy later this year have been temporarily
dashed by the deceleration in US economic growth.
The dollar/D-Mark rate may have also been affected by heavy selling of
dollars by the Bundesbank. Speculation in the foreign exchange markets
suggests that the German central bank, which bought billions of dollars last
autumn during the crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism, has been
steadily selling those dollars in the markets to rebalance its reserves.
Economists are divided over where the economy is heading, but the consensus
is that it will record a steady, if unspectacular, rate of growth for the
rest of the year - somewhere in the range of 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent.
This does not necessarily bode well for the dollar, but what does is the
likelihood that the German and Japanese economies will weaken throughout
1993, and that the Bundesbank and the Tokyo government will lower interest
rates in an attempt to spur domestic economic activity.
The Bundesbank, in particular, is likely to take a more aggressive easing
stance, now that it apparently believes inflationary pressures are under
control.
Dollar investors, however, cannot count on the interest rate differential
being narrowed further by a tightening in US monetary policy. As Mr Edward
Yardeni, chief economist with CJ Lawrence in New York, says: 'We believe
that the Fed's number one concern is to keep the economy growing. So the
recent weakness in the foreign exchange value of the dollar shouldn't be an
obstacle to lower rates.'
As for President Clinton's role in the dollar's future, it is too early to
tell if his current problems are merely the early-term hiccups of a freshman
administration, or, more worryingly, a precursor of worse to come. Whatever
happens, it is fair to say that, for now at least, the foreign exchange
markets do not have much confidence in the new president.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (12): Cassandra of the Greenback
 -Profile of SBC's Jim O'Neill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST CURRENCY forecasters puzzle endlessly these days over whether the US
economic recovery will sustain its recent pace,and whether the US dollar
will go up or down.
But Mr Jim O'Neill, the 37-year-old head of currency research at Swiss
Banking Corporation in London, has never expressed much doubt about the US
currency's long-term future: 'I am still looking for the dollar to reach new
historic lows against the D-Mark. The only question is whether it will
happen this year or in the next three years.'
Mr O'Neill might well merit the title 'Cassandra of the Greenback'. He is
one of the most outspoken among a minority of analysts who believe that the
US currency has a strong downside.
After the US currency plunged to a historic low of DM1.3860 against the
D-Mark last September, many analysts became overnight dollar bulls. The year
1993 was dubbed 'the year of the dollar,' with a few forecasters suggesting
that it would top DM1.85 against the D-Mark this year.
The US currency's recent inability to break the DM1.67 level has taken more
than a few investors by surprise.
But Mr O'Neill believes that its performance fits his bearish outlook on the
currency.
The tall Mancunian with a no-nonsense manner says that he became a true
dollar bear five years ago, when he returned to the UK after a long period
working in the US.
He came away believing that, after several decades as the world's greatest
power, the US had been pushed into a long-term decline by the massive
increase in the US budget deficit in the 1980s.
'For a country that loves consuming rather than saving, President Reagan's
policies made things worse by increasing the deficit,' he says. 'And it will
be an increasingly difficult problem to solve now because of interest
payments.'
President Bill Clinton's difficulties getting a budget deficit reduction
package through Congress underline Mr O'Neill's long-term pessimism. 'The
idea that a democratically elected president can cut the deficit by reducing
spending is nonsense,' he says.
Compounding his view is a belief that the Federal Reserve will cut interest
rates again to stimulate economic growth. 'Growth may be stronger in the US
than in Europe,' he says. 'But it is weak compared to the experience of
Americans. They are used to GDP of 4 per cent at least.' Mr O'Neill admits
that it is not easy to take such a tough position on the world's major
currency, especially on days when the dollar performs well. 'Quite a few of
our customers phone me up from time to time and say: 'Will you ever be
bullish for the dollar?''
Nor is it a position he relishes taking. Despite being an obsessive
Manchester United supporter, he does not tend to hold very passionate views.
He has a great fondness for the US and appreciates its advantages over
England. He says: 'We moved from the US with our young son and I fear that,
when he's 15, he'll suddenly say: 'Why aren't we living in the US instead of
England.' But although he admits to being a maverick among forecasters, Mr
O'Neill believes that the problem is not with his judgment but with the
market's.
'I have never known an environment where so many investors have had the same
view - that the US is going up and that Europe is going down. The scope for
disappointment is very great.'

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Computer Industry - Systems, Software &amp; Services
(10): Users upgrade as prices fall - Printers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE the recession, the printer market has remained buoyant. As prices
fall, users upgrade, writes George Black.
The market is split into three roughly equal sectors: dot matrix, inkjet and
laser. Sales of dot matrix machines have fallen sharply, but this has been
offset by higher sales of inkjet and laser models.
While the volume of printer sales has gone up by around 20 per cent, prices
have come down around 30 per cent, so the market has probably grown only
slightly by value.
Increasing demand for better quality documents is the main force which is
driving sales up. Dot matrix printers are becoming steadily less popular,
even though prices are very low and the quality of output has improved.
Inkjet is much the fastest growing sector by units, up 85 per cent last
year, according to market researchers Romtec. These machines are bought
mainly by small businesses and home users who consider laser prices still
too high but want better quality than they get from their old nine-pin or
24-pin dot matrix printers. Inkjets now offer 300-360 dots per inch.
The boom in sales of inkjet models is also related to the fact that they are
quieter than dot matrix models, which is especially important for home use.
Colour inkjet sales have more than doubled in the past year; output is slow,
but many users are willing to sacrifice speed for colour. Colour laser
printing is still prohibitively expensive for most purposes.
However, inkjet is now seen by many users as a low-end solution. A
laser-printed document looks printed where an inkjet-printed document looks
no more than nicely typed. Laser printers are replacing inkjets in many
businesses as they become cheaper.
Lasers are classed as a 'mature' market compared to inkjets, but they are
nonetheless the fastest-growing sector by value of sales.
Laser quality is also improving, which matters to users who want to print
complex graphics; 300 dpi is the current standard, 600 dpi is spreading.
Many large companies looking for economies during the recession have been
sharing laser printers among staff on their local area networks. To do this,
they need machines capable of eight or 16 pages per minute output, rather
than two or four pages output by the slower ones.
Ms Nicky Ayre, Hewlett-Packard's UK peripherals programme manager, says that
network managers now spend a lot of their time dealing with printer
problems. The result is a growing market for slot-in cards, which report
printer faults to the network manager and allow many of them to be solved by
remote diagnostics.
Prices keep being pushed down by strong competition and the fall in the cost
of processors and memory. The market is extremely price-sensitive and most
suppliers have to offer discounts.
Laser prices have fallen sharply; most now cost Pounds 600-Pounds 700, some
as little as Pounds 400. Average inkjet prices are Pounds 300-Pounds 400,
but some are as low as Pounds 250, and dot matrixes Pounds 150-Pounds 200.
This could be almost as low as prices can go because of the inherent
manufacturing cost. High volume manufacturers can take this, but some
smaller players may soon find the market very tough.
Hewlett-Packard remains clear market leader, with around half the sales of
lasers and around 40 per cent of the whole market by value. Its dominance is
re-enforced by its close relationship with Canon, which makes its laser
printer engines.
In the past couple of years a number of printer makers have begun to market
their products by stressing environmental aspects.
Kyocera, a Japanese laser printer manufacturer, highlights its ability to
use 100 per cent recycled paper and its use of toner containers which can be
burned, rather than non-biodegradable ones which end up as toxic landfill.
Mr Phil Murphy, Kyocera's UK general manager, says that many large firms now
have environmental representatives who are taking an interest in these
issues. He also points out that there are European Commission directives to
member states to increase the amount of recycling of paper and packaging.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Computer Industry - Systems, Software &amp; Services
(9): The clones feel the heat - Personal computers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Dollars 50bn-a-year world personal computer market is in ferment. Prices
are falling again, new and more powerful microprocessors are arriving,
distribution channels are changing and the long predicted wave of
consolidation may have finally begun.
PC prices have been dropping sharply in most markets for the past two years.
Although the pace is likely to be slower this year, most analysts expect a
further decline of 10 to 15 per cent in Europe in 1993.
However, says Mr Chris Fell of Dataquest, 'The amount spent by customers is
falling much less quickly because people are trading up.' This is because
many customers are choosing higher specified machines - for example those
with faster microprocessors, bigger hard disks, larger screens and
accelerated graphics cards - rather than the budget entry level machines.
In addition, though some price-sensitive customers will continue to buy from
the 'ultra-clones' - small companies which build a PC from commodity-style
components, mostly manufactured in the south-east Asia and sold off the
pages of computer magazines - many business customers appear willing to pay
a small premium for an established name - providing they feel they are
getting value for money.
Over the past year IBM, Compaq, ICL and Olivetti have hit back at the
cut-price clone makers with low-price and highly competitive machines of
their own. Most established PC manufacturers now have two or more distinct
product lines aimed at different segments of the market.
'Apple, IBM and Compaq all now have competitive products,' says Mr Fell, who
believes many customers are now looking at other differences like bundled
software and after-sales service. 'We are back on the price-performance
curve,' he says.
But tumbling prices, slim margins, shortening product cycles and the
evaporation of customer loyalty are taking their toll, ensuring that only
the most nimble survive. Each month a steady stream of small, and some
not-so-small, clone manufacturers on both sides of the Atlantic fail or pull
out of the PC market.
Last year's price cuts left a number of clone markers including Everex,
Tandon and Zeos in financial difficulties. Tiko in the UK went bust. Even
some big manufacturers such as Olivetti in Europe admit they do not make
money on their PC business.
Mr Wyn Griffin, general manager for major accounts at Olivetti UK, says
corporate buyers 'just buy for the occasion, there are no long-term
contracts any more.' He adds that Olivetti, which also manufactures PCs for
sale by Digital Equipment in Europe, makes its money in the UK from
providing add-on services and applications to its customers.
Olivetti's agreement with Digital, with the latter taking up to a 10 per
cent equity stake in the Italian group, is one of a growing number of
strategic alliances which have become a feature of the global PC industry
and reinforce the view that the inevitable process of consolidation has
begun.
By the middle of the decade some in the industry like Mr Bruce Sinclair,
vice-president of Northern Europe for Dell Computer, predict that the world
PC market will be dominated by just a handful of players. Within five years
nine out of every 10 PCs could be supplied by just three companies and the
race to decide who will be the survivors has already begun.
Despite the risks, no company wishing to remain in the forefront of the
world computer industry can afford to ignore the PC sector. According to
Dataquest, the information technology consultancy, the PC accounted for 44.5
per cent of worldwide computer industry revenues last year - nearly as high
a percentage as mainframe and mini-computers combined.
IBM is still the world leader in terms of PC sales, with annual PC revenues
of Dollars 7-10bn and a worldwide market share of about 12.4 per cent. It is
followed by Apple (11.9 per cent), Compaq (6.6 per cent), NEC (5.1 per cent)
and Dell (3.5 per cent), according to Dataquest.
Overall, the PC market grew by a relatively modest 7.1 per cent in value
terms to Dollars 46.5bn in 1992, says Dataquest, but PC shipments in Europe
rose by 12 per cent to 9.4m units last year with much of this growth
occurring in the fourth quarter.
The falling price of basic PC hardware highlights the increasingly important
role played in the industry by other companies including Intel, the US
semiconductor manufacturer which makes the microprocessors used by most PCs
and by the software companies such as Microsoft with its MS/DOS operating
system, Windows 'environment' and wide range of business software packages,
and Novell, which sells the most popular networking software.
In the office, desktop PCs are increasingly linked by local area networks,
providing a huge market for the operating system and business software
companies.
Outside the office, the advent of lightweight notebook computers has
delivered fully functional computing power 'on the move'. About one in five
PC sales today are portables, and the proportion is increasing.
Portable computing has been made possible in part by advances in silicon
integration which have also fuelled the steady move towards more powerful
processors. Intel has cultivated this process as part of its marketing
strategy, developing a range of upgradeable 'clock-doubled' processors built
around its top-of-the-line 80486 microprocessor - soon to be displaced by
the new Pentium processor.
However, Intel no longer has the PC processor market to itself. New chips
from its rivals, AMD and Cyrix, have added to the recent proliferation of PC
processor types and Motorola, the second largest chip manufacturer, has
recently announced its entry into the field with its first Power PC
microprocessor, developed in conjunction with IBM and Apple Computer.
The old PC distribution channels have also come under increasing attack.
Direct mail order sales have helped some companies to challenge more
lethargic rivals. Dell, the Texas-based group, more than doubled its sales
last year to Dollars 2bn.
Most companies, including Compaq and IBM, now either sell their machines
directly through the pages of computer magazines or allow other
'off-the-page' resellers to conduct 'remote sales' on their behalf.
According to a new report on distribution by Dataquest, direct sales now
represent more than 20 per cent of total PC sales in all the major European
countries except Italy. However there are signs, particularly in the US,
that direct sales may have peaked. The fastest growing distribution channel
in the US today is the PC superstore.
By the end of 1995, predicts Mr Steve Brazier of Dataquest, superstores will
account for 20 per cent of all PC sales in the US. He believes Europe will
follow suit; in the UK the first PC superstores have already arrived.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (9): They're breathing down
London's neck - Changes may be imminent in the major-centres league table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON MAY find the going harder over the next few years, as it seeks to
consolidate its position as the leading centre in the world's foreign
exchange market.
Last year's crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism helped London's
position. Traders in the UK capital had a ringside seat at the drama, and
more influence on what was going on than their counterparts in New York and
Tokyo.
However, London's role could slip if, as expected, the European Community
nations choose somewhere outside the UK as the site of the mooted European
Central Bank.
Also, New York appears to be flexing its muscles as a centre for foreign
exchange dealing, with more US fund managers choosing to shift in and out of
non-US currencies as a way of maximising their investments.
At present Tokyo is a poor third in the league table of the centres for
foreign exchange. The nearest rivals to London in the rest of the European
Community - Frankfurt and Paris - are some way down the field and look in no
great shape to make much headway catching up.
According to the latest surveys of currency market dealing, in April 1992
London accounted for currency trading worth about Dollars 300bn a day, or
almost one third of the world total of some Dollars 1,000bn. New York was
next with Dollars 192bn, then Tokyo with Dollars 128bn.
Further down the league table, in fourth place, is Singapore with a daily
turnover of Dollars 74bn, Zurich with Dollars 68bn, Hong Kong (Dollars
61bn), Frankfurt (Dollars 57bn) and Paris (Dollars 35bn).
In recent years London has increased its lead, its annual daily turnover
having risen by 60 per cent between 1989 and 1992. New York, in contrast,
saw a 49 per cent increase in turnover during this period, while the
increase for Tokyo was a meagre 11 per cent.
All these centres have seen their foreign currency business rise in line
with increased liberalisation of financial markets worldwide, in which
cross-border money flows have become much more important. Total gross
cross-border equity holdings in the US, Europe and Japan increased by more
than 50 per cent from 1986 ot 1991, from Dollars 800bn to Dollars 1,300bn,
according to estimates at the International Monetary Fund.
Institutional investors have played a big part in this increase in
international monetary flows. European funds typically invest around one
fifth of their assets in other countries, as opposed to the equivalent
proportions of less than 10 per cent in the case of US and Japanese funds.
As a result, the shifts have had a proportionately greater effect on pushing
up currency trading in Europe than in the other industrial regions. London
has been a major beneficiary of this trend, partly because of the lightly
regulated nature of capital markets in the UK.
However, according to Mr Geoffrey Dennis, head of research at the New York
office of stockbrokers James Capel, this picture may be changing. He says US
investors are becoming more interested in switching money into other
currencies as they begin to weigh up the attractions of cross-border
investments.
In the past few years, this trend has been underscored by the rise in
importance of the mainly New York-based 'hedge funds' - relatively small
funds, which do business by taking speculative positions in currencies.
According to Mr Lawrence Veit, an economist at the Brown Brothers Harriman
investment bank in New York, US investors' 'global spread' puts New York
just ahead of London as a place from which he would advocate that a
portfolio of investment be handled.
Even though there may be grounds for thinking New York will catch up
somewhat on London in the currency trading league table, London will retain
the huge advantage of being in a favourable time zone for international
foreign exchange dealing.
A possible threat is the prospect that at least a sizeable part of Europe
will move on schedule to a single currency around the end of the century.
That development would automatically greatly reduce the opportunity for
trading in European currencies, and might damage London's role.
Another possible damper for London is that, assuming some form of monetary
union comes about, the planned European Central Bank is likely to be sited
somewhere other than London, with the main contenders being Bonn and
Amsterdam. Some people think that London's role as a centre of currency
trading would be diminished if it were some way from the centre of the
action in terms of monetary policy decisions.
However, according to another school of thought, the location of the central
bank will make very little difference to currency markets in specific
countries. A fully paid up member of this school is Mr Eddie George, who
takes over as governor of the Bank of England on July 1, from his current
job of deputy governor, and who is relatively unconcerned about the
implications for London financial markets of a central bank being located on
mainland Europe.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (10): Young economies attract
institutions - Exotic currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE last 12 turbulent months, commercial bank dealers have made unusually
large profits trading in the major currencies - the dollar, D-Mark and yen.
But foreign exchange managers, with their eyes on the future, wonder
whether, in 20 years' time, the big currency plays will be in the Chinese
renminbi, the Thai baht and the Argentinian peso.
Until recently, the trade in these so-called 'exotic' currencies was mainly
directed at providing a service to corporates with direct investments in
Latin America, eastern Europe and south-east Asia.
But the growth rates of these developing economies are now much greater than
those in Europe, the US and Japan - and their equity and bond markets are
expanding rapidly.
As a result, exotic currencies are beginning to attract institutional
investors, like pension and fund managers, who want to be exposed to the
higher returns that can be made by investing in these markets.
The nature of dealing in 'exotics' is still very different from that in the
major currency pairs. Bank dealers do not make a rapid entry and exit into
these less liquid markets, in the way that they do with the dollar or
D-Mark.
Instead, investors look for long-term exposure to the higher interest rates
offered in these countries at a time when short-term rates in the developed
world are declining.
Miss Birgitte Jespersen, head of the world currency desk at Citibank in
London, says that the past year has proved how resilient these currency
markets can be when the rest of the global FX market is in crisis.
'At one stage, I thought the turmoil in Europe would have a spill-over
effect on these other markets. But some people are beginning to think that
exotic currencies are more stable than those elsewhere.'
For a currency market-maker, investment in an exotics desk can be highly
lucrative. In recent years, the rate of return from trading these currencies
has grown as fast as the profits made trading the major market.
But there is little sign that banks are rushing to set up exotics desks all
over London.
It remains a sophisticated - and skills intensive - business to get into.
'If you build a business like this without a strong customer base in the
first place, then it will not come to you,' says Ms Jespersen. 'And the
customers tend to have a natural interest in the countries they are
investing in.'
One factor which may improve the profile of the exotic currencies would be
progress in economic reform in China and Russia, potentially the two largest
markets in the world.
Political chaos in the Kremlin, uncertainties over privatisation in Russia
and inconvertibility are all cited as reasons why the rouble is far from
being considered by London dealers as a currency to trade.
The Chinese renminbi is much more likely to attract dealers' attention in
the near future. The Chinese authorities have recently set up swap centres,
which allow foreign companies to exchange hard currency for the renminbi at
a fixed rate. With China's growth rate at around 12.8 per cent, this is
clearly a currency to watch.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (7): New anxieties for the banks
 -Market turmoil brought huge profits. James Blitz considers the
implications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN DEALING rooms across London, foreign exchange managers are trying to
restrain their euphoria.
Twelve months ago, the outlook for currency trading as a business was bleak.
The prospect of European Monetary Union prompted talk of declining
volatility in European currencies. The yen's exchange rate was dormant as
Japan failed to counter its economic downturn with a fiscal stimulus. And
dealers talked about the need to find returns in exotic currencies amid
decreasing volatility in the major currency pairs.
And then there was Black Wednesday - the apogee of the greatest crisis to
hit the currency markets since the collapse of the Bretton Woods agreement
in the early 1970s.
Last autumn's turmoil in the exchange rate mechanism unleashed huge flows of
funds through the world's dealing rooms - and the major banks made large
profits managing the flows against a background of gyrating exchange rates.
'It was, quite simply, the most outstanding year the foreign exchange market
has ever had in terms of profits,' says Mr David Clark, treasurer for Europe
at Midland Global Markets.
Banks never reveal their net profits in foreign exchange, and last year's
real returns can only be guessed at by looking at the banks' annual reports.
At NatWest bank, for example, gross profits in foreign exchange were up
around 150 per cent between 1991 and 1992, from Pounds 103m to Pounds 253m.
An official at another commercial banks claimed that, in a good year like
the last one, net FX profits at a UK clearing bank would be 20 per cent of
the profits of the group's entire treasury operation. At US investment
banks, which are more dedicated to trading in international capital markets,
the profits would be even greater.
The profits were reflected in pay packets, too. One chief dealer at a London
bank, who must remain nameless, recently admitted that he had taken home a
gross salary of nearly Pounds 250,000 in 1992.
With returns like that, foreign exchange managers ought to be boasting of
success all over London. But they are not. One reason is that the banks are
all too aware of the contempt that the public has for what are deemed to be
the profits of speculation. The danger is that central banks might harness
the angry public mood to try and regulate the market.
A more immediate concern for FX managers is that, even in plentiful times
like the present, they must study the market hard if they want to stay ahead
of their rivals in a highly competitive business.
These days, a commercial bank cannot just buy and sell currencies and hope
to make a profit. A bank's size, its geographical position and the range of
products it supplies to customers are all critical to success in currency
dealing.
The fundamental goal of every FX operation today is to 'capture' the
currency flows. The more turnover that a dealing room does, the greater the
returns that it can make by playing the short-term movements in exchange
rates.
At the same time, the more a bank can see what its major customers - like
corporates and pension funds - are doing, the more intelligence it has about
how to trade its own currency portfolio for profit.
It has become increasingly clear in the past year that an FX manager who
wants to maintain his bank's share of overall currency turnover must keep
several issues at the forefront of his mind if he wants to increase
turnover. First, he must be aware of the increasing concentration of
business in the major financial centres, especially London and New York. The
Bank for International Settlements reported recently that London increased
its share of the world's FX turnover from 25 per cent in 1989 to nearly 30
per cent in 1992.
These days, the prime movers of capital around the world are pension and
investment funds, and the quantity of a single transaction can sometimes run
to billions of dollars. Only the major centres can manage the huge pools of
liquidity in the main currency pairs like dollar/D-Mark and dollar/yen.
Another critical issue is a bank's size in the market. There is an
increasing concentration of business among a decreasing number of the major
commercial and investment banks.
The Bank of England reported last year that the 10 most active banks in the
City of London had 43 per cent of FX turnover, up from 36 per cent in 1989.
Only the biggest banks can convince fund managers that they have the
financial muscle and creditworthiness that these investors seek.
The most important decision that an FX manager must make is exactly what
kind of operation he is running and what services he is offering to clients
and other banks.
In recent years, the major commercial banks have expanded their FX
operations from straightforward transactions in the spot market into the
more sophisticated operations that tend to be dominated by more specialised
investment banks.
Many commercial banks now offer sophisticated products to their clients,
like tailor-made over-the-counter options for corporates, or advice on asset
allocation. The trend is scurrilously described as 'balance sheets trying to
acquire brains'.
Mr Martin Jaskell, head of global sales at NatWest Markets in London, says
that his bank has put a lot of effort into developing its customer and
derivatives side in recent years. 'Nobody in this business wants to just
make a price. They want to know why they are being asked to make a price.
And I am always training my people to ask the question 'why?''
Despite this, the major investment banks remain confident that they will be
able to keep their customers, even though they must use the major interbank
counterparties as a clearing house for their clients' operations.
Mr Dirk Morris, of JP Morgan Investments, in London, believes the banks are
hindered by their inability to take large open positions under the Basle
agreements. 'The banks are not in a position to take on risk,' he says. He
admits, however, that, if the banks are able to improve their balance sheets
over the next few years, they may provide more competition.
That competition will seem insignificant if governments and central banks
introduce capital controls or taxes over the next few years to contain short
term currency flows.
But, for the moment, the main question preoccupying currency managers is how
they can get the biggest slice of what is becoming one of the richest cakes
in financial markets.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (8): No getting away from it -
Profile of Midland's Rob Loewy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR Rob Loewy, head of foreign exchange at Midland Global Markets, work
never really stops. Even when he goes on holiday he is plugged into CNN
within hours of departure, in spite of vows beforehand to switch off.
But that, he says, is part of the attraction of the job.' You can never
really relax. If you pick up a paper or switch on the news there will always
be something that affects you.'
Mr Loewy, 35, carries out his job from the middle of London's biggest
dealing room. He is responsible for 100 people in London and a further 21
dotted around Midland's nine regional treasury centres.
Being head of foreign exchange at a major clearing bank is quite different
from working in one of the big American investment banks, he says, stressing
the need to cater for small orders as well as the professional end of the
wholesale market.
'We would like to be the bank that can quote prices for as little as Pounds
10,000 through to Pounds 10bn,' he says.
Midland's merger with Hong Kong bank last year expanded foreign exchange
operations enormously. There are now over 700 dealers in the dealing room,
offering a range of financial instruments including foreign exchange, gilts,
off- balance sheet trading, European government bonds, futures and equities.
Having everyone together on one floor, says Mr Loewy, improves the flow of
information in an age where big events that move financial markets have
ramifications for several areas.
The merger was only one of the elements adding to an already pressurised job
last year. Black Wednesday, and turmoil on the European currency markets,
came along to test Midland's foreign exchange capabilities as the banks were
joining forces.
'There has been an increase in the number of speculators,' says Mr Loewy,
thinking back to September 16 when the pound was forced out of the European
exchange rate mechanism. 'But the role we play as a UK commercial bank is
very different. We have an enormous set of internal limits that are there to
protect our share holders and investors. We can't afford to take huge
risks.'
Mr Loewy started work as a foreign exchange dealer, aged 21, after
graduating from Birmingham University, where he read political science. He
joined his first employer, Chemical Bank, in 1978 just as foreign exchange
was beginning to expand. By the time he left for Hong Kong Bank in 1989, he
was responsible for foreign exchange operations at Chemical Bank.
He is now used to getting out of bed before 6am and driving the 9 miles to
the office before starting work at 7am. He leaves 12 hours later, and on
occasion comes in during the night to watch particularly important orders.
At home, a Reuters terminal is installed and he carries a bleeper
everywhere.
'I have a stable home environment, a wife and two small children,' he says.
'My wife is very understanding of the pressure and the hours that are
necessary for this role. She probably realises that there are not many ways
in which she can alter or change that.'
When he is not overseeing Midland's increasingly complex foreign exchange
operations, Mr Loewy is involved with recruitment, visiting the regions, and
keeping abreast of customer requirements.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Computer Industry - Systems, Software &amp; Services
(6): An unstoppable march - Mid-range systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was a time when computers fitted neatly into one of three categories.
If it wasn't a PC or a mainframe, then it had to be a mini. The decline of
the mainframe and the emergence of the powerful workstation as a serious
scientific tool have given rise to a new category of system, the mid-range
computer.
Mid-range systems have taken the centre stage of business computing. In
power and price they overlap with both extremes of IT hardware, nudging
aside some top-end PCs and intruding on the domain of the mainframe. The
machine that made the mid-range is IBM's AS400. Depending on the
configuration, it can cost between Pounds 6,000 and Pounds 1m. Since June
1988 IBM has shipped well over 200,000 systems worldwide.
Northern Foods owns Express Dairies and supplies quality food to Marks &amp;
Spencer and other retailers. It has a Pounds 2bn turnover and manages
production across 65 operating companies using 75 AS400 machines. They have
replaced a fleet of IBM minis and a mix of mainframes from ICL and Digital
Equipment.
Mr Alan Earnshaw is Northern Foods' Hull-based IT director. He says the move
to mid-range computing has proved highly cost-effective. 'The mid-range idea
suits Northern Foods' style. We're a highly decentralised organisation. With
its high ease of use, the AS400 requires very few technical staff.'
Workstations spread access to the system across the site, running a whole
raft of stock control applications while Electronic Data Interchange ensures
rapid and frequent exchange of data with customers and suppliers.
The change in staffing requirements has been dramatic. Mr Earnshaw
characterises the standard local system manager as the site accountant. The
mid-range box is happy in an office. A mainframe operates in a purpose-built
computer room with dedicated support staff.
With its diversity of business software, distributed workstations and
extensive data links to third parties, Northern Foods typifies the mid-range
user. It also highlights the decline of the mainframe. 'Had there been no
mid-range option we would be running several mainframes and be faced with a
different order of IT costs,' says Mr Earnshaw.
IBM's critics have made much of the declining market for mainframes. The
largest computer company in the world grew fat on dominance of the mainframe
market only to see revenues undercut by the latest generation of systems.
IBM's own success with the AS400 is a measure of the demand for cheaper and
more practical processing power rather than a case of a manufacturer
undermining its own market.
There will always be a place for the mainframe. Processing vast arrays of
statistics or hosting huge specialist programs such as airline reservation
systems will continue to require a mainframe processor. But industrial
management means buying in off-the-shelf software and a continuous
throughput of factory data. The mid-range computer is designed with this
function in mind. In particular, its operating system is written to host the
very programs that business users find most practical.
The London International Group, the large medical equipment to
film-processing concern, has followed the downsizing path, dispensing with
IBM mainframes in favour of AS400s. But taking this plunge was not easy. Mr
Pratt, in charge of London International's IT, was involved in writing its
custom-built mainframe software application.
A mid-range program was installed from an external software house. 'There
was over 10 years worth of loyalty to that software on the mainframe. We had
to tell the end-user to change the system he was used to working with.' Mr
Pratt still says the move was well worth this disruption. Without the
hideously complicated mainframe operating system to worry about he can shop
around for business software packages to meet emerging requirements. 'Now we
don't spend time designing software inhouse we can concentrate on
implementing the right system, not trying to develop it ourselves.'
The mid-range threatens more than large hardware. It has also decimated one
species of employee. Mr Pratt notes the demise of the systems programmers
who kept mainframe applications functioning. 'They were skilled boffins,
very peculiar animals.' They may be missed for the colour they added to
computing, but the cost of finding and retaining their esoteric skills was
an incentive to change IT purchasing policy.
The march of the mid-range system seems unstoppable. But while the mainframe
will always be around to cater for some needs, so the term mini-computer is
still applied to small business computing. Hewlett-Packard splits its HP9000
range between minis (Pounds 20-100,000) and mid-range systems (Pounds
150,000-1m). The contemporary mini delivers much more power than its
predecessors, but HP finds it useful to preserve the term to define user
communities.
If specialist programmers have been a casualty of the mid-range revolution,
purchasers have felt the benefit. Taking the processing power from an
air-cooled computer room can only bring it closer to the business customer's
real needs.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Computer Industry - Systems, Software &amp; Services
(8): Small is beautiful - Memory card technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERSONAL computer owners have been used to the idea of systems that seem to
get smaller, faster and more powerful every year - but recent advances in
hard disk drive and add-on memory card technology have accelerated the pace
of this development tremendously.
One example of this is a new device that is smaller than an average
matchbox, weighs less than two ounces and can store the equivalent of 14,389
typed pages. Developed by Hewlett- Packard last year, it is one of the
world's smallest hard disks - able to store 21.4 Megabytes of data in a card
that is only 2 inches long, 1.44 inches across and 0.4 inches high.
Known as the HP Kittyhawk Personal Storage Module (PSM), it is typical of
the growing number of computer add-ons that are only a little larger than
the average credit card. These peripherals are typically fast, slick,
expensive and small. The computer industry is so convinced that users want
these tiny devices that they are developing them in unprecedented numbers.
Over the past year these credit card-sized add-ons for palmtop and notebook
computers has been produced to conform with the Personal Computer Memory
Card Industry Association standard. They include cards that add hard disks,
network connections, modems and other crucial functions to tiny PCs. The
PCMCIA expansion slot is basically a 68-pin tiny replica of the AT expansion
bus used in most 386 and 486 desktop computers.
PCMCIA was formed in 1989 as a non-profit trade association aimed at
establishing a worldwide memory card standard for the PC industry. The
standard defines the size, pin assignments, electrical requirements,
protocols and file formats of credit card-sized add-on cards. More than 130
manufacturers, semiconductor companies, software suppliers and systems
integrators have joined the PCMCIA, which two years ago reached an agreement
with Japanese standards group JEIDA on adoption of the specifications.
The PCMCIA membership list is impressive. The group's executive members
include Fujitsu, Intel, IBM, Microsoft, Mitsubishi, Polaroid, Poqet, Sharp,
Texas Instruments and Toshiba. Associate and affiliate members include
Apple, Commodore, Compaq, Epson, Lotus Development, Motorola and
WordPerfect. The breadth of support the group appears to enjoy across the
industry could make it succeed where similar previous attempts have failed.
According to Mr Bruce Sinclair, Dell Computer vice-president for Northern
Europe, PCMCIA has been successful because it offers practical sense for the
computer industry while helping out computer users at the same time.
He says that producers of portable and hand-held computers no longer have to
're-invent the wheel' every time they want to add new capabilities to the
systems. With PCMCIA, chances are that a third party company has already
designed that part that is needed to make a new solution possible. 'It is
one of those solutions that makes sense for everyone - being able to add
specialist communications functions designed to a common standard is just
brilliant for everyone.'
Assuming that PCMCIA becomes established as a standard, the question arises
of what PCMCIA cards will be able to do. To start with, their abilities were
very modest - offering only 128K of storage. Within the past year, 1 and 2
Mb PCMCIA cards have become more common - and 4 Mb are now starting to be
offered.
But PCMCIA is not just a standard confined to defining silicon storage.
Slots conforming to the standard can be designed to be used as general
purpose expansion slots - using six spare pins on the interface that cater
for input/ output devices such as network adaptor cards and modems.
Despite having to do far more than just provide memory, these cards are the
same physical format as the current memory cards. The commitment to produce
such devices is demonstrated by the membership of Intel, Hayes (the modem
manufacturer) and 3Com in the PCMCIA group.
Release 2.01 of the PCMCIA specification, issued early this year, includes a
refined 'execute in place' facility - which allows software companies not
only to put their software onto PCMCIA cards, but also include on the card
the RAM needed for the application - so that on a PC-compatible handheld
machine, for example, you can run Lotus 1-2-3 without using up any of the
system RAM on your pocket PC.
Release 2.01 also offers better support for flash memory and improved low
voltage operation. Further definitions are provided for the input/output
capability of the cards - which, its developers say, is similar to that of
an extended industry architecture expansion bus on a PC. By 'multiplexing'
on the 68 pin connectors, you can now plug in cordless communications
systems (such as pagers), network cards, modems and other devices.
The final issue is a psychological one. How many users or corporations will
be willing to pay Dollars 500 to Dollars 1,000 for add-ons that bring
capabilities to handheld computers that they can get much more cheaply in
desktop systems? Also, there is likely to be resistance to expensive add-ons
that are so small they can easily be lost through a hole in a suit jacket -
or even left on the bus by accident.
The best advice for those buying PCMCIA cards is to think of them as you
would of any other add-on circuit board for your desktop system. Buy from
reputable dealers and get them to install your PCMCIA cards - just as you
would add-on cards for the inside of your existing personal computer. That
will ensure you treat the equipment with the respect it needs to survive
life in a pocket or notebook PC. By comparing the PCMCIA version of the
add-on with the same item for a desktop system, you get a good idea of the
price premium you'll pay for 'going portable'.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Computer Industry - Systems, Software &amp; Services
(7): Every home should have one - Personal computers: the next consumer
blockbuster?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE personal computer revolution celebrates a dozen years in business, it
is starting to shift its attack on the status quo from the office to the
home. For years, so-called 'futurologists' have predicted that the PC could
change the average person's home life - but only recently has the technology
been invented to meet that challenge.
Personal computer technology - and its recent 'ease of use' ideas - are
being used in everything from automated bank teller machines to hand-held
'personal data assistants', televisions, videotape recorders and microwave
ovens. The computer industry is being particularly successful at
popularising the use of pictures to control equipment.
Many modern video recorders, for example, now have either a built-in
'screen' for selecting which television programmes their users wish to
record or offer the ability to display and enter this information on a
television screen.
Pictures such as that of a runner at the starting blocks of a race (to use
that, you should enter the start time of a programme) and the same runner
reaching the finish line (where you are supposed to enter the time when the
programme ends) are typical of the 'icon-based' approach to controlling
consumer devices that is evolving from the PC world.
Among the most voluble leaders of the computer industry on this subject is
Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and co-founder. The success of its
picture-based operating environment for personal computers - Microsoft
Windows 3.1 - gave the company a revenue growth last year of Dollars 950m.
Mr Gates is working to incorporate Microsoft Windows technology into a wide
variety of electronics products in both the office and the home. His aim is
an environment where fax, photocopier and telephone all run some form of
Windows - and are connected to one another. Meanwhile, the telephone PABX
shares its phone directories with the electronic mail and voicemail systems.
Both are available to Personal Information Management products for dialling
by PC modems.
The most intriguing of Mr Gates' office equipment notions is the handheld
Windows machine - which he suggests would be not unlike Apple Computer's
planned Newton hand-held computer. The Apple system allows users to control
it through the use of handwriting on the screen. But Mr Gates says this is
actually a limitation. 'Newton relies on the weakest part of the system to
do the most work - I prefer structured interfaces on modeless devices.'
It is clear, however, that projects which marry personal computer technology
to office or consumer electronics technology will require partnerships
between computer companies and those in other industries. Thus, Apple
Computer recently struck an agreement with electronics giant Toshiba to help
bring its software expertise to the Japanese market for 'personal digital
assistants' or PDAs.
A number of large manufacturers are counting on these PDA systems growing
fast in popularity - with Hewlett-Packard, for example, recently releasing
its 100LX series hand-held computer with built-in electronic mail.
The key to their success is their built-in communications functions. The EO
system developed by AT&amp;T in the US, for example, marries pen computing with
cellular phone technology to allow users from anywhere to read electronic
mail - as well as upload and download information and carry out standard
computing tasks. All of this happens by using a machine small enough to fit
in your hand and entirely controllable by pointing at pictures.
The growing number of US and European software companies in partnership with
Japanese manufacturers indicates how the market for 'picture-based control'
of electronic devices will advance. When pictures are used for control, they
are far more international. Just as certain international symbols are used
in automobiles for headlights, windshield wipers and brakes, common symbols
in the future could be used to control computers, video recorders,
refrigerators, radios and any other device that uses software.
In fact, some futurologists expect more and more consumer electronics
technology to be built around the PC - or at least to use a form of
picture-based control as an underlying control technology. They suggest, for
example, that it is ridiculous for people to have three remote controls in
their home (one each for the TV, the VCR and the CD player).
Instead, people might in future have a few wallmounted, colour flat screens
in their house that will be used for television, video games and information
management. The controls for all home systems would be condensed onto a
single hand-held controller running picture-based personal computer
software.
But many technological issues need to be settled before then. These include
international decisions about the resolution of high-definition TV, the cost
and reliability of large, colour screens and regulatory issues about their
use.
In the meantime, you can expect personal computer technology to appear in
almost anything that has electricity running through it - and pointing at
pictures to become the internationally standard way of controlling them.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (6): An insurance or a threat to
stability - Rising interest in products that allow currency exposure to be
hedged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE many reasons for the dramatic growth of the foreign exchange
market in recent years. But no technical development is as important as the
invention of currency-based products which allow investors to hedge their
underlying assets against exchange rate risks.
In the 1980s, fund mangers initially diversified their portfolios because of
the reduction of capital controls and a need to find new sources of income.
But the factor clinching their strategic decision to invest abroad was that
they could buy special financial instruments like forward contracts and
options to hedge themselves against risk.
More recently, the crisis in the exchange rate mechanism has sponsored a new
wave of interest in these derivative products among corporates who want to
hedge their currency exposure in a more volatile environment. Foreign
exchange managers in London report a huge increase in demand for these
products in the past 12 months.
As a result, the outlook for these markets appears healthy. According to the
International Monetary Fund, spot transactions in FX accounted for 73 per
cent of turnover in the UK market in 1986, and 50 per cent in 1989. But the
share of turnover in forwards and swaps increased from 27 per cent to 47 per
cent.
However, while these instruments seem like insurance premiums to some
investors, they are being seen as a threat to the stability of the foreign
exchange market.
In particular, serious concerns are being expressed about the development of
the market in options, which allow investors to buy or sell a currency if it
strikes a certain price.
As with so much else in the foreign exchange market these days, the concern
over options arise from recent changes in the industry. In the early 1980s,
the trade in currency options was in its infancy and supply-led. But, more
recently, new and more sophisticated ways have been thought up, by which
corporate and institutional customers can hedge themselves against risks.
There is a particularly strong interest in over-the-counter options (OTCs),
which a bank sells to an individual customer, and can be tailor-made to meet
customer requirements in considerable detail.
Mr Patrick Allaway, managing director of global foreign exchange sales at
Swiss Bank Corporation, says there are now 15 variations of the 'plain
vanilla' option. Customers, these days, can buy exotic products called
'barrier options,' or 'basket options,' which allow them to reduce their
cost of hedging.
The development of these options has made them extremely attractive to
investors and turned the derivatives business into a lucrative one.
But in an age of volatile exchange rates, the security which the customer
receives from buying the option may create problems for the bank which is
writing it.
In the last six months, several options-writing institutions have incurred
severe losses, because they assumed that the ERM set fixed floors and
ceilings for excessive movements in exchange rates.
Nobody talks openly about the casualties in this market. But a commonly-held
view is that several French institutions, which had particularly well
developed options businesses, were severely burned in the crisis.
There were also indications earlier this month that the Bank of Spain lost
billions of dollars by using options to defend the peseta's exchange rate.
The central bank in Madrid has denied the allegations. But dealers say that
the Bank of Spain wrote call options allowing investors to buy D-Marks at
exchange rates between Pta72 up to Pta80, in the belief that there would be
no devaluation to these levels.
Amid higher volatility in European exchange rates, there has been a general
rise in the cost of premiums. But foreign exchange managers believe that,
where casualties occur, it is because senior executives do not understand
the risks being taken by their staff.
Mr Martin Jaskell, head of global sales at NatWest Markets, says: 'If there
is not a proper understanding of the risks in this business there is a
potential for almost unlimited losses. That is why proper control is
absolutely essential.'
Central banks have also raised concern about the prospect of credit default
in this industry. Last month, the Bank for International Settlements said
that it might extend the amount of cash cover that commercial banks had to
set against the risks that were being taken in currency and futures markets.
But concerns remain that the growth of the derivatives market could help to
intensify currency flows which are directed against fixed exchange rates.
Again, last year's currency crisis provided a case study in the nature of
this market. In September, when both the lira and sterling were pushed close
to their ERM floors against the D-Mark, banks which had written options to
sell the currency below the ERM floor had to hurriedly hedge their
underlying (or delta) positions to ensure they could pay customers at the
new rate.
As the IMF puts it in its recent report on capital flows: 'Standard option
pricing formulas do not allow for the possibility of jumps in exchange
rates, for example during a realignment of ERM central parities. A surprise
realignment could greatly increase the delta leaving the bank underhedged.'
For the moment, the options business, which accounts for only 3 per cent of
total turnover in foreign exchange, is not big enough to concern regulators
too much.
But one leading currency manager in London said recently that if the share
of turnover grew much more, the impact of these products on the market would
be worrying to central bankers
'If you got to the stage where 10 per cent of all turnover were options
related, then the underlying moves would effectively account for half of all
FX turnover,' he said. 'And once you get to those levels, the more risk
there is that you would get extreme moves in the major currencies as a
result of derivatives.'

Central banks: Five ways to avoid a repeat of last year's crisis

<TEXT>
THE CENTRAL bankers of the leading European nations are not normally the
objects of pity. However, last year their world turned upside down.
One of the lessons from the crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism
was that the ability of central banks to keep currencies within prescribed
ranges - when faced with determined pressures from the foreign exchange
markets - is extremely limited.
As the consequences of the ERM turmoil sink in, the European Community's
central banks and their governments may be forced dramatically to scale back
their ambitions for linking exchange rates. That could place formidable
barriers to the Maastricht plan for creating a pan-EC currency union by the
end of the century.
The limits to the powers of central banks was spelled out in a report* by
the International Monetary Fund released last month. 'Until recently,' it
said, 'attacks on exchange rate regimes were treated as aberrant speculative
disturbances of otherwise well-functioning markets. It is now recognised,
however, that attacks can be the market's response to policy goals that are
perceived to be inconsistent with a given parity.'
The report added: 'The markets eventually decide on what are unsustainable
(economic) situations and, when they do, their size alone increasingly
allows them to force adjustments.'
Between last autumn and early this year hundreds, if not thousands, of
currency investors around the world collectively decided that the currencies
of the UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland were over-valued in the
mechanism against the D-Mark.
All were forced to devalue, despite European central banks selling in the
final six months of last year an unprecedented DM284bn from their reserves
in a vain effort to prop up the weak currencies.
Behind the drama was investor sentiment that the fragile economies in the
countries concerned could not contend with the high interest rates needed
for their currencies to keep within their D-Mark parities.
As one central banker involved with the drama put it: 'It was a very
difficult situation. We were defending the indefensible.'
There are five main ways in which central banks and their governments can
try to ensure that a similar currency crisis within the EC does not take
place again.
One is to hone the array of tactical weapons at the disposal of central
banks to defend currencies, including changes in interest rates and
intervention on markets to raise or depress currencies' value.
There is a limit to the efficacy of such actions. In the case of
hypothetical increases in interest rates to defend a country's currency, the
financial markets may calculate that the tight borrowing conditions will be
unacceptable in a country hit by economic slowdown. Hence high interest
rates may create more turbulence, rather than reduce it.
This was accepted in a report on the currency strains published last month
by a group of international officials headed by Mr Lamberto Dini, director
general of the Bank of Italy. This concluded: 'The effectiveness of interest
rate adjustments may depend on whether market participants perceive that the
authorities are strongly committed, and politically able, to maintain
interest rates at the adjusted levels on a prolonged basis.'
The second way forward is to agree to adjust fixed-rate systems far more
speedily to take account of economic pressures. Mr Wim Duisenberg, chairman
of the EC committee of central bank governors and the head of the Dutch
central bank, says Europe should have decided to encapsulate all the
realignments during the six-month crisis 'into one long weekend'.
Such neat solutions may be difficult to achieve, on the grounds that
governments normally see devaluation as a big political and psychological
blow. They therefore submit to a devaluation only as a last resort and after
a great deal of argument that can be highly time consuming.
The third idea is to try to arrange that, within a specific geographical
region, the economies of individual countries which elect to peg exchange
rates are reasonably in harmony with each other.
In such a state of affairs, exchange-rate fluctuations should remain fairly
small. This can best be managed, according to the Dini report, 'in economies
with relatively flexible wages and prices, low structural rigidities and
countercyclical fiscal stabilisers that are relatively effective and well
disciplined.'
In Europe, the closest to a group of countries linked in this way is what
can loosely be called the west European currency bloc - centred on Germany,
the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria - where there is a relatively high
degree of economic convergence and interest rates are set largely according
to German monetary policy. There may be practical difficulties in achieving
economic convergence across a broader set of EC countries in the way
envisaged under the Maastricht treaty.
The fourth idea is to move rapidly to abolish all differences in exchange
rates; in other words, to a full currency union for the countries involved.
This option would probably be valid only for those nations which had already
agreed the necessary large degree of economic convergence. For other
countries such a move would involve an unacceptably high degree of economic
strains.
Fifthly, nations could decide that the strains of trying to stay in a fixed
exchange rate system are greater than the benefits , and give up on this
idea. For the moment Britain - and possibly Italy, too - is in this
position. All the signs are that Britain, at least, will be in no hurry to
return to the ERM, which reduces the possibility of Europe's fourth biggest
economy joining in a monetary union according to the agreed timetable.
