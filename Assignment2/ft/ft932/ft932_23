FT  22 MAY 93 / Sport: Marathon which drove to the limit - Rallying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS

<TEXT>
IN THE END, the London to Sydney rally was a marathon fully deserving of the
name. It evolved, over 30 days and 11,500 miles of some of the world's
roughest and most remote roads and dirt tracks, from a tough but
conventional rally into a sometimes harrowing test not just of driving
skills but of endurance and the will to succeed, or even survive. En route,
most notably in its 1,200 miles traverse of the bedlam which envelops even
the most rural of India's roads, it descended occasionally into the stuff of
nightmare.
The 'sting in the tail', 3,700 miles across Australia where hazards covered
the spectrum from choking dust to blinding blizzards, confirmed that it is
an event deserving a place in motor sport history. That 86 cars out of the
106 which set out from London on April 17 on the Lombard Marathon made it
across the finishing line at Sydney Opera House on Sunday might give the
appearance that it was easy - at least in comparison with the original 1968
event, whose 25th anniversary this marathon commemorated. In 1968, only half
the starters managed to stagger into Sydney.
But in reality, the 1993 event 'has been 100 times more competitive than the
1968 version,' according to the 1993 director, Nick Brittan who competed on
the original marathon.
In 1968 the marathon was mainly a test of stamina. It took just 11 days to
complete. This year it took 30. In 1968 a competitor who developed a problem
could not stay up with the event and simply fell by the wayside. The 1993
marathon stopped each night to avoid having a bunch of fatigued and
semi-comatose rally drivers hurtling across continents for days and nights
on end.
That in turn has allowed a benevolent rally rule that, provided a competing
car can roll across the start line each day, it can be deemed a finisher.
A close look at the results reveals the full story: Francis Tuthill and
Anthony Showell, the deserving British winners in their Porsche 911,
incurred time penalties of 13 hours, 36 minutes and 11 seconds during this
odyssey.
Second-placed Ian Vaughan, a vice-president of Ford Australia, and co-driver
Barry Lake were 14 minutes and 20 seconds behind in their Ford Falcon. Even
Daily Mail photographer Neville Marriner and I only incurred a total of five
hours' more penalties in bringing home our Unipart-backed Lotus Cortina
36th.
By 50th place, penalties were measured not in hours but in days. The last
classified finishers, Australians Les and Roselee Johnson in their Ford
Mustang, incurred penalties of more than three days and nine hours.
For these, and many others, the closing stages were not a fight to the
finish against other drivers but a fight merely to finish, trying to hold
together cars deranged by the constant batterings of rough special stages,
often taken at 100 mph-plus, or damaging off-track excursions into rocks or
trees.
Lawrie Beach and Jim Rosenow had become Australian heroes by the time the
marathon had carved its way across the Nullarbor Plain and the worst of the
outback. Purely privateers and with no significant sponsorship, they had
carved their way to third place overall in their Ford Falcon.
On the penultimate day, their rear axle broke. They repaired it. on the
final stage of the final day the differential broke. They finished in 55th
place - on a towrope. Not once did their composure or the good humour
falter.
In contrast, we became almost embarrased by the reliability of the Unipart
car. We had started out calling it derisorily the Pompidou centre because of
its roof-mounted exhaust and other external pipework - and finished up
fondly calling it the 'old girl'. Over all 11,500 miles, despite crashing
once into rocks and once into the trees, plus several other minor
excursions, damage was confined to four exploded tyres. Otherwise we merely
changed oil, filters and other mundane items.
The casualties were not only mechanical. There was a disclaimer attached to
every competitor's dog tags reminding us that 'motor sport is dangerous'.
For Jenny Brittan, wife of the organiser, and herself a respected former
racing driver, the caution became reality in an accident on a stage between
Port Augusta and Broken Hill, when the Escort she was driving with David
Thomas hit a tree and rolled itself into a ball. Jenny broke five ribs.
By the time we reached Sydney four lives had been lost.
Australian co-driver Brian Ginger died in a road accident in Turkey. Basil
Wadman, co-driver to Tony King in their Hillman Hunter, suffered badly from
severe food poisoning as the marathon wound its way through the 50` heat of
the Rajasthan desert. He reached Udaipur in a state of collapse and died
after 12 hours in a Delhi hospital.
Basil did not have my good fortune in being detected, in similar state, by
nurse Jill Diamond, also competing, as our cars stopped together at petrol
pumps.
She wrapped me in rags for an 800 km drive to Bombay in scorching heat, and
had Neville keep drenching me in water as he drove. Drifting in and out of
consciousness by the time we reached Bombay, and barely aware of being
lifted out of the car, where I was doubly fortunate to fall straight into
the hands of Dr Rosemary Nixon, another competitor.
It was in India, too, that two young spectators lost their lives. Had this
happened in eastern Europe or Turkey, the scene of some earlier
irresponsible driving, the marathon could well have been plunged into
crisis. I hope, as do many of the other drivers, that it will be a long time
indeed before I drive again in a country where, even Indian officials
acknowledge, there is a fatality every 70 kilometres of the Udaipur to
Bombay road - on every single day.
In all other respects, this marathon has proved to be an event unique in its
format and extraordinary in the variety of images and experiences thrust
before its competitors' eyes. The 50th anniversary Marathon would be in
2018. Mr Brittan, my entry cheque is in the post.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Motoring: A pedigree Jaguar - The lineage of the latest big
cat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOUNG PEOPLE say Jaguars look old-fashioned. I suppose they are right. The
XJ12 is the latest - and will probably go down in motoring history as the
greatest - Jaguar saloon. At a glance, you can see that its shape, its
character, reflect the ideas of the late Sir William Lyons.
When he founded the marque in the 1930s, he demanded grace, pace and space
from his designers. Jaguars were sportily low in build and had wood veneer
and leather interiors. They appealed to buyers lacking funds to satisfy a
secret craving for a Bentley.
Nothing has really changed. The XJ12, introduced recently after a seemingly
endless gestation, is the latest development of the XJ40 model which
replaced the 18-year-old XJ6 in 1985. It does not look much different from
the XJ6; just a bit sleeker. But, then, there could never have been any
doubt that the XJ6 of 1972 had been sired by the Mk II of 1959.
One could go on, but I rest my case. Nothing matters more to Jaguar than
family tradition. Whims of fashion are ignored.
A Jaguar with a cherished registration number is as ageless as a Range Rover
(born 1970 and changed outwardly only in detail) or a Rolls-Royce. Could the
motoring equivalent of the man on a Clapham omnibus tell a 1965 Silver
Shadow from a 1993 Silver Spirit II? I would not put money on it.
Undeniably, the XJ12 has grace. And, with a 318 horsepower, six-litre,
12-cylinder engine shoe-horned under the bonnet, more pace than one can
possibly exploit in public. Jaguar claims acceleration from 0-60 mph (0-96
kph) in 6.8 seconds (two seconds less than the previous XJ12) and a top
speed of 155 mph (250 kph) compared with the old model's 139 mph (224 kph).
Who am I to disagree?
More to the point, its mid-range acceleration has been transformed by the
six-litre engine's greater pulling power. It leaps in virtual silence from
50 mph to 70 mph (80-113 kph) and 70 mph to 90 mph (113-145 kph) in 3.2 and
4.8 seconds respectively.
A driver who makes the fullest use of the performance - especially the
acceleration - might need to think about refilling the 19-gallon (86-litre)
tank soon after covering 200 miles (325 km). Even when accelerating only
moderately, I saw the computer's read-out of instant fuel consumption drop
to single miles per gallon figures. My test car's 13.4 mpg (21 l/100 km) in
town improved steadily to 15 mpg (18.8 l/100 km) on the motorway. Had my
journey been longer, 18-19 mpg (15-16 l/100 km) might have been achievable.
In the past, I have found Jaguars driven briskly on country roads to have
been soft enough to make passengers feel queasy. Stiffer suspension and
lower-profile (55 series) tyres have firmed up the V12's ride most
agreeably, yet only a handful of less sporting luxury cars can match its
lack of road noise. The steering is light and does not have much feel.
Parking is easy - provided you remember the turning circle is more than 40
ft (12.4 metres).
High gearing (nearly 29 mph/47 kph per 1,000 rpm) brings cloistered calm to
motorway cruising. The Connolly hide and walnut-veneered interior is in
classic English good taste. This ambience is no longer as exclusive as it
was; wood trim has become obligatory on posh cars wherever they are made.
But, in the Jaguar, it all seems natural and uncontrived.
So, the Jaguar has grace and pace - but what of space? By modern standards,
it does not have much. The roof line is low, so the seating position is too.
Four people can travel in style in an XJ12, but they had better not try to
take a large suitcase apiece. Four weekend bags practically filled the boot;
two sets of golf clubs in their trolleys would not go in.
The same six-litre engine and four-speed automatic transmission are now
available in the XJ-S coupe at Pounds 45,100 for the hard top, Pounds 52,900
for the convertible.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Sport: Man who keeps an eye on net profits - Tennis, the
Business / Keith Wheatley meets administrator Brian Tobin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIAN Tobin shakes his head over Wimbledon. As president of the
International Tennis Federation this Australian-born former banker heads an
organisation that oversees the most efficient dollar-generating sport in the
world. Sponsorship, massive TV revenues and player endorsements have turned
tennis into a huge global business.
And then there is Wimbledon, still the private ivy-clad members' club in the
leafy suburbs of south-west London. Playing on grass for heaven's sake,
instructing the world's superstar players to substitute their 'billboard'
kit for the traditional predominantly white and still unsponsored - not
counting the discreet little Rolex clock on each court.
'Every year I used to bring John Elliot for a day at Wimbledon, when he was
head of Carlton Breweries and he'd always say: We're going to sponsor this,'
recalled Tobin. 'I've still got a Pounds 10 bet with him that it will never
be the Fosters championship but I don't suppose I'll collect it now.'
When Tobin shakes his head over Wimbledon, it is with respectful awe. The
two-week All England championship makes a total profit of around Pounds 14m.
The ITF boss is at heart a traditionalist but as befits a person who started
work as a 16-year-old cashier, he also likes to see a strong bottom line.
When the two combine it makes him even happier.
Tobin is not unsympathetic to those critics who say that the highly-paid
week-in, week-out treadmill of professional tournament tennis is deadened by
an excess of cash over personality. 'The top players are probably making
Dollars 250,000 a week, win or lose,' he said in his office high above the
manicured lawns of London's other tennis shrine, Queen's Club.
'Their style of tennis play is becoming stereotyped by coaches urging them
to always go for percentages. The players are becoming robots, not only in
their style of play but in their personalities,' says Tobin. 'The money and
the entourage combines to create a player that must win 80 per cent of the
time. It doesn't develop flair.'
Like many administrators of his generation, Tobin can hardly believe he is
looking back to John McEnroe with nostalgia and affection. 'When John cuts
up badly you find that 20 per cent of the public complain and 80 per cent
came back to see his next match,' explained Tobin. 'You need a mean streak
to be a champion but there must also be control.
'Those strong personalities make the game attractive but you also need
regard for your fellow human being, which some of the new generation don't
have. John Newcombe, Arthur Ashe and Fred Perry had it.' Tobin was a player
of that generation, if not that ilk. He reached the No 8 singles ranking in
Australia and won the hard court doubles title with Lionel Brodie. In the
final they beat Lew Hoad and Ken Rosewall.
Yet is it not hypocrisy to criticise the amount of money in the game when
the ITF created the biggest purse of all - more than Dollars 2m for the
winner - with the annual Grand Slam Cup? Tobin is clearly unhappy on this
particular spot, saying only that the GSC was created to defend the four
Grand slam tournaments at the time of the ATP tour emerging.
'The Grand Slams are over the hump and don't really need the Cup to
survive,' said Tobin. 'It's a five year deal with an option to renew, so
whether it continues past 1994 remains to be seen.'
The ITF has grown with its sport. It now has nearly 50 employees and an
annual budget of Dollars 25m. The Davis Cup is the ITF's biggest asset,
creating well over half the its annual income through TV rights and
sponsorship. It is the biggest annual team sports competition in the world,
'dwarfing soccer's World Cup,' Tobin adds like a proud parent.
In 1993 a total of 101 countries will compete in Davis Cup and 76 in the
womens' equivalent, the Federation Cup, although among individual players
there can be considerable problems of motivation and commitment.
'Sanctions don't work against tennis players these days,' says Tobin. 'It's
like kids. You've got to give them incentives all the time. The top players
from some countries simply can't be bothered unless you dangle enormous sums
in front of them.'
The biggest recent boost to tennis was its return to the Olympics in 1984 as
a demonstration sport, with full status at Seoul in 1988. A lot of smaller
and developing countries, says Tobin, have a policy of only giving
government aid to Olympic sports. The ITF had 101 member countries in 1984,
now the total is 176.
'Last year we had two 15-year-old girls from Madagascar doing well in
Barcelona,' says Tobin.
Tobin is puzzled and worried about the increasing dominance of speed and
power in professional tennis. 'You get all sorts of suggestions. One chap
came up with superficially attractive idea of raising the net six inches -
until we asked him to consider how many million posts around the world would
have to be replaced.'
The ITF is amending ball specifications. 'We have a harder ball at one end
of the scale and a softer one at the other, so on a fast surface you could
slow it down with the softer ball,' he reasons. 'but I think the main area
of problem is the racquets but I doubt we can do much about those on the
market now.
'The ITF could restrict the materials that could be used from now on but who
knows, in 10 years there might be a commercially available material that
will build you a racquet hitting the ball 300kph. Sports that try to hold
the line against new technologies often end up in trouble.'

FT  22 MAY 93 / Sport: The slugger takes aim - Tennis, the French Open /
Champion Jim Courier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUCCESS, they say, breeds success. If you believe such aphorisms then look
no further than the 22-year-old American, Jim Courier, as the winner of the
1993 French Open which begins at the Stade Roland Garros in Paris on Monday.
For the past two years he has outhit, outwitted and outlasted all opposition
on the slow red clay. Courier in full flight - a whirling mass of flailing
arms and pumping legs - may not be a pretty sight but his physical game is
undeniably effective. Courier, a stocky right-hander with a two-handed
backhand, dashes about the court smiting the ball as if he hates it. His
western grip forehand, a heavy topspin blow which delivers most of his
winners, resembles the slugging action of a baseball batter. Not surprising,
this, because Jim seriously considered a career in professional baseball
with the Cincinnati Reds before settling on tennis. The baseball cap and the
striped shirts he wears echo his lasting love affair with America's national
sport.
Courier is trained by Jose Higueras and Brad Stine to peak at the Grand Slam
events. 'They are the only wins anyone ever remembers,' he says. He looked
fit and hard again when I watched him overpower Goran Ivanisevic to win in
Rome last Sunday, his fourth tournament win of the year. He thrives on
physical challenges, as he proved on a sweltering afternoon last January in
Melbourne by outplaying Stefan Edberg to win a second consecutive Australian
title.
Is there anyone with the physical and mental qualities, as well as the
technical ability, to unseat him? In last year's final Courier overwhelmed
Petr Korda. The Czech form does not suggest he will be a serious challenger
this time.
One who may have the necessary qualities is the 18-year-old Ukrainian,
Andrei Medvedev. He won the junior champion at Roland Garros in 1991 and
defeated the experienced Swiss Davis Cup player Jakob Hlasek in last year's
French Open en route to the fourth round, where Courier ended his run.
Medvedev won his first tour titles last year in Geneva and Stuttgart and
this year has won in Estoril and Barcelona, both clay court tournaments. He
is a tall and intelligent young man, with a lively sense of humour, mature
beyond his years. His fluent baseline game - few men hit the ball harder or
time it better - gives him a solid base from which to mount his net attacks
and his tactical awareness is already well developed. He is just the sort of
player who might make a sudden surge - as Michael Chang did at 17 in 1989.
Could Chang do it again? Certainly he has the courage and determination to
succeed, plus a wonderful return of serve, and few men can equal his speed
about the court. But the modern game is dominated by young gorillas wielding
their graphite rackets like Darth Vader's light sword.
One such giant is the 6 ft 5 in German, Marc Goellner. His feat in beating
Edberg and Lendl to capture the Nice title as a qualifier last month was
remarkable. It would be even more astonishing, though, if he were to do
anything of note in Paris. Life is not that simple.
Of the others Ivan Lendl, with three previous wins from five finals is the
most experienced. Furthermore he has just won on clay in Munich and is as
fit as a flea but at the age of 33 he may no longer have the mental stamina
to win seven hard matches in a row.
The new world No 1, Pete Sampras did not look impressive in losing to
Ivanisevic in Rome but claimed he was only preparing for Paris. At his best
Sampras has the powerful game to beat anyone but I fancy his chances more on
Wimbledon's fast grass than on slow European clay where his lack of patience
is exposed.
What of Becker? A former semi-finalist, Boris has still to win a tournament
on clay. Like Sampras, expect more from him at Wimbledon.
Overshadowing the women's event is the absence of the champion Monica Seles.
Gunther Parche's attack on the world No 1 in Hamburg will have repercussions
throughout the sporting world. Security at tennis tournaments will be
increased with players escorted to courts where they have to pass among the
paying public.
More worrying is the copycat factor. In Rome last week police arrested
Hubert Uebele, a bearded middle-aged man from Heidelberg. They took him back
to his hotel room and discovered a pistol, knives, pictures of Gabriela
Sabatini and Becker and tickets for front row seats for the Foro Italico.
The women will all try to block out thoughts of danger as they battle for
the absent queen's crown. The obvious favourite is Steffi Graf who has won
two of her five French Opens finals. A recent win in Berlin will encourage
her supporters but I am not convinced that Steffi has recovered the
consistency which she will need on slow clay. Too often of late there have
been lapses of concentration.
Sabatini looked fit and eager when I saw her in Marbella on Wednesday
training with her new coach Dennis Ralston. She is determined to make a
strong bid for the No 1 spot.
However, I believe the title might go to Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, the
youngest winner when she beat Graf in a memorable final in 1989. The
ebullient Spaniard is having the most consistent year of her career with
four titles already and has taken on Sabatini's coach Carlos Kirmayr. He has
helped Arantxa to relax in her matches - tension has always been her
weakness - but what would you expect from a man who once ran a band called
The Fleabags]

FT  22 MAY 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Child's play for teachers -
Cynthia Hurst meets two women who make educational games
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CYNTHIA HURST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREAT of redundancy turned out to be a blessing in disguise for two
Oxfordshire women, who have turned their experience of helping children with
learning difficulties into a thriving business.
Sue Lucksford and Jasmine Davey started HELP (Help Eliminate Learning
Problems) Educational Games, in the summer of 1991 when both - in their 50s
 -faced possible redundancy. In the event, Lucksford retained her position
as a special needs teacher in Didcot, but Davey lost her job as a special
needs resource technician, and a spare room in her home became the base for
the new enterprise.
HELP has found a ready market for its 13 board and card games. These are
aimed at specific reading and spelling problems, including dyslexia.
'Teachers are snatching them up,' said Davey. She says teachers have less
time to develop their own learning aids, and so are eager to find a
ready-made product.
'The potential to expand is enormous - we haven't touched half the schools
in Britain yet. As far as I know, no one else is doing this sort of thing,
so there was a gap in the market which we filled.' HELP began modestly, with
private savings, some financial backup from the government's Enterprise
Allowance Scheme and free advice from the Heart of England TEC and the
Thames Business Advice Centre. Turnover in the first year was Pounds 20,000,
and has grown to Pounds 3,000-Pounds 4,000 a month. The games are priced at
about Pounds 10 each.
'We've been ploughing all the money back into the business, so we haven't
borrowed at all except to buy an Apple Mac computer,' said Davey. 'I was
doing all the graphics with Letraset before, which took forever, but now I
can do them on the computer, and we also keep a database of customers on
it.'
Ideas for the games, with names like Odd Bods, Black Hole and Secret Sid,
come from Lucksford. They cover an age range from four to adult education,
and include some blank cards for teachers to add their own words.
Once an idea is developed, Davey does the artwork, developing it to the
ready to print stage. Most of the printing is done by a company in
Northamptonshire, which then ships the games nearby for finishing, cutting
and packaging.
They are then returned to Didcot, where Davey, Lucksford and their families
make sure each game box has the proper components and instructions. They are
shipped from the local post office to schools throughout Britain and
Ireland, and as far afield as Pakistan, where a British school has placed an
order.
At the moment, lack of money is the main obstacle to expansion.
'We really can't afford to do a lot of advertising, but we have had quite a
bit of success with educational shows and we have been included in the
catalogue for a purchasing group in Yorkshire,' said Davey. 'We tried mail
shots at first, but that was just too expensive. And we'd like to do
educational shows in London, but the cost of a stand is about Pounds 1,500,
compared with less than Pounds 100 elsewhere.'
She has taken HELP's products to shows, although travelling is difficult
because her disabled 16-year-old son needs constant care at home.
'The schools in Wales were very interested,' she said. 'One school wanted to
know if we could do versions in Welsh, and we'd be happy to try, but some of
the games are based on rhyming words, and what rhymes in English wouldn't
rhyme in Welsh.'

TOM Chapman punches a few keys on a computer in one of his four clothes
shops and on the screen appears itemised listings of what his well-heeled
customers have been purchasing. Rolling through the customer base, a long
entry suddenly flashes up.
Earlier this year one man strolled into Chapman's tiny retail empire and
spent Pounds 13,500 on himself in one go. The screen tells the tale. Rows of
Cerruti suits at Pounds 500, several Armani trousers at Pounds 230 each,
blocks of Missoni ties starting at Pounds 50, Pounds 300 crocodile belts by
J M Davidson, Gianni Versace shoes from Pounds 225 a pair. 'The largest
single purchase we've had like this is probably Pounds 20,000 to Pounds
25,000,' Chapman says. Recession always leaves some people unscathed.
Chapman is only 29 years old. He started his first clothing shop in
Wimbledon 10 years ago and made a Pounds 6,000 loss in the first 12 months.
Last year, his company, Matches generated sales of Pounds 3.1m, on which it
made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 245,000. Apart from a nice salary the
business provides Chapman with a Mercedes sports car and a house in one of
the smarter parts of this village suburb in south-west London where he has
all his retail outlets, virtually next to each other.
Chapman started Matches as a teenager with no knowledge of retailing or
clothing. He studied hotel management at college. His wife, Ruth, had done a
management trainee course with Jaeger, the clothing retailer. Although
Matches is successful, the first four years were bit of a disaster. 'We
started too far down market. It was only in 1987 that we began to get it
right so we really only got one year of the 1980s retail boom.'
Chapman began with Pounds 6,000 of his own money and a Pounds 5,000
overdraft facility from Barclays. He took a lease on a small shop for Pounds
4,000 a year. 'Rents were much lower then. On that unit it is now Pounds
21,500.'
This was the time of Next and Benetton and Chapman chose to sell relatively
inexpensive clothing but a little more exclusive than those offered by the
chains. He pored over trade magazines and bought in London's fashion
district around Great Portland Street - 'that's the cash and carry for the
trade'. He also visited Paris and Milan, using addresses of suppliers there
provided by the French and Italian trade centres in London.
'It was a lot easier then than now. You could get three months' credit but
no wholesaler will accept that now. It's too risky.' The shop though was not
a raging success. After a first-year loss it broke even in its second year
and made a paltry Pounds 9,000 profit in its third.
Then Chapman's luck turned. He found himself lumbered with nine women's
sweaters retailing at a hefty Pounds 270 and was astonished to sell them all
within a week. It was the end of 1986. 'That made us think we were working
too low down the market. We needed to sell an image, and promote a more
glamorous feeling within the shop.' The unit was refurbished, more expensive
designer-labels introduced and profits soared in the year to April 1988 to
Pounds 90,000 on a turnover of Pounds 320,000. A menswear shop was opened
virtually next door in 1988.
Matches' four shops are made up of two menswear units, one dedicated to more
casual clothing, and two for women's wear with one unit given over entirely
to the Italian brand Max Mara. All shops are small, about 600 sq ft each.
Matches raised turnover last year by a quarter and is aiming to increase it
15 per cent this year. This growth is based on strict guidelines Chapman
adheres to on buying policy, pricing, shop design, staff training and target
marketing.
Chapman sells clothes from about 75 so-called 'collections', most of them
from top designer labels including Byblos and Umberto Ginocchietti,
Moschino, Ralph Lauren and Montana. Almost all are French and Italian,
together with the occasional American and Spanish brand. Matches sells a few
British labels, including Joseph Conran and Rifat Ozbeck but fewer than it
used to. 'We had too many problems with quality and they are also very small
with generally a small-minded attitude to business. You would get them
saying to you: 'would you mind paying 10 days early because I've got the
bank on my back' or 'we can't deliver on time because we can't get the
cloth.' Joseph Conran now produces in Italy.'
Matches sells almost no clothing from Germany. 'German lines have never
worked for us. They do not have the cut or style or feeling we are trying to
promote. Hugo Boss is the only German line we carry. It has its devotees.'
Chapman has exclusivity agreements with most suppliers, usually stipulating
that they cannot supply to other retailers within a four mile radius from
Wimbledon.
Chapman says he sticks rigidly to recommended retail prices which are used
by 70 per cent of his suppliers. He complains to them if he discovers any
shop selling below. He says that some West End department stores sell above.
One top label stipulates that retailers must sell at a mark up of 300 per
cent - to protect sales at its own shops. Chapman says this is unusually
high. Matches operates on a gross margin of 38 per cent. Some people able to
pay say Pounds 1,365 for a Versace jacket might not care much perhaps about
who is making what margin.
The shops are done out with stone flooring and low level lighting.
Refurbishment costs up to Pounds 70,000 a unit. Customers are offered
coffee, and beer and wine is also available. Sales staff are on a basic
salary of Pounds 11,000 a year but get bonuses on each individual sale of
more than Pounds 600. This reflects the company's aim of selling a complete
'look' to a buyer: men's suits are displayed with matching shirts and ties.
Each shop has a manager and the tiny group has a relatively high staff level
of 24. Sales staff are required to be friendly and non-pushy and saying 'Can
I help you?' is banned. Staff costs last year were Pounds 380,000.
Attention to detail is encapsulated in the use of the company's Pounds
45,000 computer system designed specifically for retailers. Chapman uses the
information this churns out to target catalogues to those on the
9,000-strong mailing list depending on what they have already purchased.
Individual customers' sizes and preferences in colour and style are
tabulated making it easier for spouses and other relatives to purchase
gifts. Customers can buy at one-sixth the price, paying the rest over six
months, a method used for Pounds 400,000 of sales last year. The computer
system has been stolen once and Matches suffered one ram raid. A quarter of
the company's turnover is made in its annual reduced-price sales.
Chapman's next project is a retail outlet in the US where he is looking for
a site. 'I have this idea of a shop where you can buy clothes, have
something nice to eat, may be have pottery or antique pens or whatever for
sale in the same area making it a unique experience for the customer.'

FT  22 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Reform plan for divorcee pensions -
Radical changes to family and pension law are proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAMILY and pensions law will be changed radically if the government decides
to follow a long-awaited report on pensions and divorce released this week.
The working group on pensions and divorce was formed in January last year by
the Pensions Management Institute with funding from the Joseph Rowntree
Foundation. Its report recommends that courts should be given the power to
divide occupational and personal pension rights between a divorcing couple.
A pension is often the most valuable asset after the home. Yet, the courts
have no power to transfer pensions rights from husbands to wives. In
Scotland, pensions are regarded as part of 'matrimonial property' which
should be shared fairly on divorce but specific guidelines and valuation
methods do not exist.
The issue is compounded by the high numbers of divorces in the UK where one
in three marriages ends in failure.
The recommendations apply to men and women but women will be the principal
beneficiaries of changes to the law. Some 67 per cent of men receive an
occupational pension in their own right compared to only 26 per cent of
women. Since women's average earnings are less than men's, the average
income from an occupational pension for a woman is only Pounds 30 a week
compared with Pounds 61 for men.
For these reasons, the principle of pension splitting on divorce has been
recognised but the difficulty has been deciding the best way of doing this.
The PMI working group recommends that pension rights should be calculated by
using the same statutory cash equivalent as that used for calculating
transfer payments. The courts would decide the proportion to which the wife
would be entitled and the sum would be released from the husband's scheme.
It would then be transferred to the wife's occupational or personal scheme;
alternatively, the wife could choose to have benefits in her husband's
scheme, without the need for a transfer. The husband's pension benefits
would be reduced accordingly. If maintenance is being paid, the court should
be able to oblige the husband to take out life assurance for his former
wife.
'To split a pension payable in the future, you have to put a value on it
now,' said Richard Malone, director of actuaries Noble Lowndes and a member
of the working party. 'The recommendation, therefore, is to use the current
transfer value - a figure which would be paid out to another scheme if the
member had changed jobs. This value is readily available and would not
require substantial costs and administration.'
In Scotland, the usual practice is for a cash equivalent of the husband's
pension to be given to the wife in cash. She can either use it to provide
for her own pension or can spend it. The PMI's recommendation of a transfer
to another scheme means that the cash equivalent could only be used to
provide a pension for the former wife.
A transfer also gets around the problem of scarce liquid assets on divorce.
'One often used device (in Scotland) is to give the house to one party and
leave the pension rights for the other unaffected. While this may work where
there is a great deal of equity in the house, recent conditions make this
solution less and less likely to be effective,' said Bob Hubbard, president
of the PMI.
The working group adopts the principle of a 'clean break' (see below), where
the financial link between the divorcing parties is severed as soon as
possible. The reallocation of assets is thus not dependent on either party's
future actions.
There are complications, however. Many employees are contracted out of the
State Earnings Related Pension Scheme with part of their pension rights -
the guaranteed minimum pension - standing in place of Serps. When payment of
the pension starts, this portion is set against the Serps entitlement.
The PMI would like to see the GMP regarded as a pension fund asset which
could therefore be reallocated on divorce, but this may not be possible if
it is treated as a state benefit.
Another difficulty is where a divorce takes place when the pension is
already being paid. The PMI recommends earmarking part of the pension and
paying this to the divorced wife with life assurance for her funded from
other assets.
The PMI's report is a set of recommendations and it is too early to say how
much will be acted on. Women considering divorce will probably find that
there is little point in a tactical delay in the hope of benefitting from
any law changes. Sir Alec Atkinson, chairman of the working group, estimated
it would be at least another two to three years before prospective changes
in the law would take effect.
However, if the recommendations are followed, divorced women stand to
benefit substantially as illustrated by the following case studies provided
by Noble Lowndes.
A couple divorce at the age of 35 after 10 years of marriage. The husband,
who started a pension before the marriage now earns Pounds 40,000 and the
value of his accrued pension rights is Pounds 31,000. His wife, who stopped
work on a salary of Pounds 15,000 to have children, has 5 years of
pensionable service behind her and the value of her accrued rights is Pounds
7,000. The balance is Pounds 24,000 in the husband's favour. Under the PMI
guidelines, the wife would be entitled to half this amount - or Pounds
12,000 on divorce.
At the other end of the scale, a couple divorce after 35 years of marriage.
The 60-year-old husband has just retired on a final salary of Pounds 70,000.
The value of his pension rights is Pounds 713,000 and his current pension is
Pounds 46,667. His wife, who has never worked, has no pension rights in her
name. On divorce, she would be entitled to either half the value of her
husband's pension fund - some Pounds 356,500 or an earmarked pension of half
that payable to him, namely Pounds 23,333.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The cost of a clean break - Divorce
can be financially traumatic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HEATHER FARMBROUGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE DIVORCE proceedings start, most women understandably feel they want to
be independent from their former partner as soon as possible. In the highly
charged emotional climate which surrounds most divorces, they may be tempted
to agree a less than perfect financial settlement to speed up the process.
When a couple is relatively well-off, a so-called 'clean break' settlement
may seem the most attractive arrangement. This involves a one-off capital
payment with no maintenance. The links are severed, the recipient - usually
the wife - has a tidy sum over which she or he has total control, and both
parties can rebuild their lives.
That is the theory, but it does not always work in practice. For the wife,
the danger with a clean break settlement is that there is no coming back for
more. If she falls ill she may find there is not enough income to cover long
term nursing care.
A clean break may be better for a younger woman, but it may seem unfair on
elderly wives if their husbands keep the lion's share of the family assets.
And if things go wrong, there is little chance of help from an ex-husband -
as Sarah Hardy discovered.
When she married, her husband encouraged her with his financial backing to
become an underwriter on a number of Lloyd's syndicates which were then
profitable. She divorced in 1989. One of the syndicates is now facing heavy
and as yet unquantifiable losses. Although Sarah resigned from Lloyd's in
1987 she faces possible financial ruin as a result of her share of the
syndicate's losses. She bitterly regrets not arranging a token amount of
maintenance as this would have enabled her to go back to her former husband
for help with her living expenses.
Like many women, once her marriage broke up she wanted to be financially
independent. The lump sum enabled her to buy a flat and still have some
money to invest. She also felt that a one-off capital sum offered her
greater certainty than a future depending on maintenance payments. Had she
had children, their education and needs would have been met by separate
maintenance orders in their favour.
If she had agreed a conventional 'capital plus maintenance' settlement,
rather than a clean break, she could in certain circumstances have gone back
to the court to vary the level of maintenance (it can go down as well as
up). However, maintenance levels can only be varied to cover income needs
and not capital, so she would have been unable to claim against her former
husband to cover her Lloyd's losses.
In Sarah's case, however, such a settlement would have been unlikely as her
husband was exceptionally wealthy. When a couple is reasonably well-off,
solicitors and the courts will usually propose a clean break arrangement.
Indeed, courts are specifically directed to try to do so. The courts decide
how much the wife should get and how that figure should be determined,
setting a precedent for solicitors.
Over the last 15 years, in assessing the appropriate sum the courts'
approach has been very much based on the wife's strict income and capital
needs - what she will need to re-house herself and so on. While looking at
the amount required to compensate her for the loss of maintenance to meet
her income needs, the courts will also look at her life expectancy. The
shorter this is, the lower the sum required. The sum is assessed on the same
basis as an annuity.
This may be better for a wife in her 30s who may well remarry, but for the
elderly wife of a wealthy man the situation is less rosy. Until 15 or 20
years ago, when settlements were more likely to have been based on a share
of the couple's assets, a wife of many years could reasonably expect to
receive a settlement equal to at least one third, sometimes half, of the
couple's assets.
But nowadays, given the courts' increasing tendency to make orders on the
basis of reasonable needs, she could end up with considerably less. Her
husband may be left with a far higher proportion of the assets although his
needs may be equal. Only where an exceptional contribution has been made by
a wife towards a family's wealth will she get more than she ostensibly
needs.
As matrimonial lawyer Siobhan Readhead, a partner with the solicitors
Radcliffes &amp; Co, argues: 'The net result of all this appears to be that
increasingly little value is placed on the contribution made by a wife in
terms of bringing up children, home making, caring for the family and
supporting a financially successful husband. Furthermore, the older and
longer serving the wife, the less she needs to maintain herself until death
and therefore the smaller the proportion of the assets she may be awarded.'
Obviously, settlements depend on individual arrangements and circumstances.
There is no golden rule as to how much money a couple need to have to
justify a clean break; much more depends on whether the wife needs to be
re-housed and the kind of income and lifestyle to which she is used. In a
number of cases, the ultimate decision on the kind of settlement will rest
with the courts.
But a clean break settlement is safer and surer than maintenance payments
and usually better for women with careers. 'If it is possible to get a
decent amount of capital, there may be some justification for a clean
break,' says Fiona Price, managing director of independent financial
advisers Fiona Price and Partners, which specialises in advising women.
Should you find yourself heading towards divorce, what should you do? It is
worth engaging a good specialist matrimonial lawyer who can advise you how
to protect your interests the moment you realise your marriage is in serious
trouble. You will also need a good financial adviser.
During divorce negotiations, one of the first things a professional adviser
will ask you to do is to make a list of your and your husband's income and
assets. 'The biggest problem,' says Price, 'is that many women have no
financial experience and few financial arrangements in their own name. They
have not filled in a tax return so it is very difficult to get the
information they need. It is often down to how clever the solicitor is in
finding out about the husband's assets. It may even involve the wife
rummaging through drawers when the husband isn't there.'
You will also be asked to work out exactly what you spend. Fiona Price finds
that women often underestimate this. Make sure you include the odd coffee
while shopping, the papers, the hairdresser's tip and holidays as well as
your community charge, mortgage and gas bills. It can be dangerous to be too
parsimonious over this period because your husband may be able to argue that
you can afford to live like this all the time.
If you want to remain in the family home, one option as part of a clean
break settlement is to buy out your husband by paying him a lump sum for his
share. If you have to borrow the money or raise an extra mortgage, you will
be able to obtain tax relief on the mortgage. Your husband, too, will be
eligible for tax relief on a mortgage for a new home. If the family home is
to be sold and the housing market is volatile or rising, it may be
worthwhile to agree on a percentage of the sale proceeds rather than a
specific sum of cash.
While negotiations are proceeding you will have to agree on a temporary
financial arrangement until your settlement arrives. In most cases, existing
arrangements for household bills and school fees continue. But it may be
pointless venting your feelings by going on a credit card spending spree as
a thrifty husband may have already cancelled his payment arrangements.
If you are awarded a lump sum and are going to depend on this money for the
rest of your life, you need to invest shrewdly. You want to get the highest
possible income in the most tax efficient way, without exposing yourself to
risks and leaving plenty of flexibility.
Remember that you will be taxed on the income from the settlement, whereas
maintenance is not chargeable to tax. However, if you do not use your
personal allowance, the first Pounds 3,445 would be tax free.
But perhaps the most important advice for all women, however unlikely
divorce might seem, is to consider how you could remain independent if
things do go wrong.
Even if you give up your career and have no independent income, it is
important to know what financial provisions are being made for the future.
It is also a good idea to keep your own savings or inheritance legacy in a
separate account and to ensure that as many of the family assets as possible
are held in joint names. And remember, next time you contemplate leaving,
divorce can seriously damage your standard of living if you are married to a
rich man. The older you are, and the richer he is, the smaller proportion of
his assets you are likely to get.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Where zeros came first - The six year
record of Scottish National Trust / Doing the Splits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRUCTURE of split capital investment trusts can make all the
difference. Two trusts might have identical investment records, but with
different structures, investors can enjoy (or endure) wildly divergent
returns.
The experience of Scottish National is a case in point. It moved to a split
structure shortly after River &amp; Mercantile in 1987, but with a different,
more aggressive structure.
When Scottish National's split structure was created, there were several old
splits from the late 1960s and early 1970s still in existence. According to
Lewis Aaron, analyst at S G Warburg Securities, the problem with the old
trusts was that the assets had risen so much over the years, that the trust
had more than enough funds to repay the income shares. There was thus no
gearing left on the capital shares (gearing in this instance means that when
the assets of the trust rise, the capital shares rise even faster).
According to Aaron, the idea was that new split capital structures should
have 'permanent gearing'. Scottish National was therefore the first trust to
create zero dividend preference shares. By growing at a steady rate per
year, the zeros were rather like the crocodile in Peter Pan, which
relentlessly pursued Captain Hook. The trust manager, like the Captain, is
doomed forever to glance nervously over his shoulder, as the zeros doggedly
follow him. Only if he wins the race, can the capital shareholders profit.
The new structure was launched in the heady days of early October 1987, when
the stock market seemed set to rise at 15 per cent per annum forever. Within
two weeks, the Crash had ruined that assumption; and the early 1990s saw a
slump in the performance of high-yielding shares, which were the major
investment area for the trust.
The trust's managers have done a good job growing the assets, according to
Lewis Aaron, and investors in some classes of the shares have done extremely
well. But the gearing has not worked out for the capital shareholders - who
have lost nearly 80 per cent of their original investment.
As the graph shows, the net asset value of the capital shares has fluctuated
enormously, falling from 148.8p at the end of September 1989 to 2.8p at the
last year end. In fact, if you allow for the full repayment value of the
other shares, the capital shares have no asset backing at all.
Scottish National has a small amount (Pounds 1.5m) of 6 per cent cumulative
preference shares. But the main classes of shares are: stepped preference,
zero dividend, income and capital.
The stepped preference shares are entitled to a 5 per cent increase in
dividend and asset backing per year. Issued (like all the other major
classes of share) at 100p, they are entitled to be repaid at 171p in 1998.
At the current share price of 151.5p, the shares are on a gross redemption
yield of 8.2 per cent, according to manager Peter Kennedy. In the year to
September 30, the net dividend per share was 6.08p.
The zero dividend preference shares receive no income but will be repaid
immediately after the stepped preference shares. Their scheduled repayment
value in 1998 is 325p, equivalent to a gross redemption yield of 11.3 per
cent per annum from the 100p issue price. In retrospect, this combination of
high growth (which is taxed as capital gain) and security was a fantastic
deal.
Accordingly, the zeros have more than doubled since issue and the gross
redemption yield at the current price of 208p is 8.8 per cent. The trust has
sufficient assets to repay the zeros (at the final repayment price) 1.25
times; what in the jargon is called a 'cover' figure of 1.25. Warburg's
Aaron reckons 'the zeros and the stepped preference shares are around the
right price'.
The income shares receive all the revenue of the trust after the stepped and
cumulative preference shares have had their fill. Their entitlement to
assets steadily grows from 50p per share on issue and will reach 100p at
wind-up.
The income shares received a net dividend of 8.85p per share in the year to
September 30, 1992. However, the trust has forecast that the dividend will
fall to 7.5p per share this year, putting the shares, at 91.25p, on a flat
yield of around 10.25 per cent.
The capital shares receive no dividend but are entitled to all the assets of
the trust after all the other classes of share have been repaid. Were the
other classes of share to be repaid at their 1998 wind-up value, there would
currently be nothing left for the capital shares.
According to Lewis Aaron 'you would have to be an extreme bull, not only of
the market, but of the high-yielding sector, to buy the capital shares.' He
says asset growth of 5.2 per cent per year is needed for the capital shares
to get any return at all; 5.75 per cent per year to get back the current
price of 23p.
There are also warrants which allow the owner to buy capital shares at 300p,
but it would need asset growth of 12.5 per cent per annum for these to be
worth exercising.
Like many other split trusts, the manager Peter Kennedy of Gartmore Scotland
has a high portfolio yield (1.5 times the All-Share Index - around 6 per
cent at present) in order to offer the income shareholders a good return.
He has 15.6 per cent in gilts and 8.7 per cent in convertibles to help
produce this income and his list of 10 largest stocks contains several
utilities: BT, Shell, Lloyds Bank, BAT, North West Water, Welsh Water,
Prudential, Scottish Hydro, Commercial Union and South Western Electricity.
Key facts
The trust has a market capitalisation of around Pounds 369m and assets of
Pounds 343m, so the combined share package stands at a premium to asset
value. Gartmore Scotland is paid a management fee of 0.35 per cent of net
assets per annum.
Board
Sandy Struthers, the chairman, is also chairman of J &amp; A Gardner. Other
directors are: Charles Connell, executive chairman of the eponymous
shipowning company; Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore Investment Managers;
Peter Runciman, executive chairman of Shanks &amp; McEwan; Gordon Waddell,
executive chairman of Fairway (London); and Archie Walker, a director of
merchant bankers Singer &amp; Friedlander.
Savings scheme details
The minimum investment is Pounds 25 per month or Pounds 250 for a lump sum.
Buying and selling charges are 1 per cent (plus 0.5 per cent stamp duty on
purchases). Gartmore no longer has a Pep specifically tailored to Scottish
National.

Little-known tax privileges

OWNERS OF businesses and farms are well aware that the relief from
inheritance tax on gifts of much business and agricultural property is now
100 per cent. What is not widely known is that, with proper planning, it is
possible to use the 100 per cent relief twice, so as to double the value of
assets which can be gifted free of inheritance tax.
Property qualifying for 100 per cent relief includes 'in hand' (ie
untenanted) agricultural property, most businesses and partnership
interests, and shareholdings in unquoted trading companies carrying more
than 25 per cent of the votes. The property must have been owned for at
least two years.
As a result, such property can now be passed down to the younger generation
entirely free of inheritance tax.
Consider Mr and Mrs Archer, whose assets are as follows: Mr Archer owns
agricultural estate worth Pounds 1m, a farmhouse worth Pounds 400,000 and
investments of Pounds 1m; Mrs Archer has investments of Pounds 300,000.
The Archers wish to retain and to continue to run the estate. However, they
have been told that they should consider giving some of their investments to
their adult children. This is because, if the Archers survive the gifts by
seven years, they will avoid the inheritance tax that will otherwise be
payable on death.
Unfortunately, their investments contain large gains. If Mr and Mrs Archer
give them away, CGT will be payable. They therefore do not do so.
Mr Archer dies first, leaving everything to his wife. There is no
inheritance tax to pay, because gifts between spouses are exempt from tax.
After her husband's death, Mrs Archer takes charge of the business, though,
as in Mr Archer's lifetime, the actual day to day management is undertaken
by others.
Mrs Archer dies three years later. Her property passes to the children. Both
her agricultural estate and her farmhouse qualify for 100 per cent relief
from inheritance tax, but she has to pay Pounds 460,000 on her investments
of Pounds 1.3m (40 per cent of the excess over the Pounds 150,000
threshold).
This may seen a reasonable outcome. But the young Archers do not consider it
at all satisfactory. For they have been advised that, had two steps been
taken, the tax bill could have been reduced from Pounds 460,000 to nil.
One step is for Mr Archer to bequeath the agricultural estate and Pounds
150,000, equal to the tax free 'nil rate band', to a suitable flexible trust
for the potential benefit of Mrs Archer and the children. This will not give
rise to a tax charge on his death, because the agricultural estate qualifies
for 100 per cent relief, and the Pounds 150,000 is within the tax free band.
The other step is for Mrs Archer, after her husband's death, to buy the
agricultural estate from the trust for its market value of Pounds 1,000,000.
The effect of this is that Mrs Archer ends up owning the agricultural estate
together with the farmhouse and Pounds 150,000 of investments; and the trust
ends up owning Pounds 1,150,000 of investments (ie Pounds 150,000 bequeathed
by Mr Archer plus Pounds 1,000,000 paid by Mrs Archer).
The result of these arrangements is that no inheritance tax is payable on
Mrs Archer's death.
It may be objected that Mrs Archer would be unwise to divest herself of most
of the investments in this way, for she might require them, eg. to meet
nursing home bills. The answer to this is that, as she is a potential
beneficiary of the flexible trust, the investments in the trust can be paid
out to her at the trustees' discretion if this proves necessary.
The moral is that owners of business and agricultural property which
potentially qualify for 100 per cent relief would be well advised to review
their assets and their wills to ensure not only that 100 per cent relief is
available but also that it can be turned into 200 per cent relief by being
used twice.
Sophisticated technical provisions are required to pave the way for the
strategy, and very few conventional wills contain these. In the authors'
experience, owners of businesses and in-hand farms have begun to appreciate
the remarkable tax privileges which their property enjoys, or to take
advantage of the tax planning opportunities which these privileges present.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Being a foreigner on a diplomatic assignment in the UK I do not pay income
tax here. I am considering buying a flat in England.
If I decide to let the flat after I leave the UK, will I have to pay income
tax on the rental payments I receive? Will I be entitled to the personal
allowance of Pounds 3,445?
I am living with an English lady who has her own job. Will she be able to
have any claims in relation to the flat? Would the situation change if we
got married in the UK?
Yes the rental income will be taxable (after you cease to be entitled to
diplomatic immunity). Whether you will be entitled to a personal allowance
depends on your nationality and which country you will be living in; it is a
pity that you did not tell us more about yourself.
If the rent is paid to you the tenant will have to deduct 25 per cent tax;
you will then have to claim repayment of any excess tax, or pay any
additional tax, as the case may be. If the rent is collected by an agent
(professional or private), the tenant will be able to pay the rent in full;
the agent will be assessed to tax on your behalf, paying an estimated tax
bill at the beginning of January each year, with an adjustment after the end
of each tax year (April 5).
Write to the Inland Revenue public inquiry room, Somerset House, Strand,
London, WC2R 1LB, and ask for pamphlets IR20 (Residents and nonresidents:
liability to tax in the UK) and IR87 (Rooms to let: income from letting
property).
Talk to your solicitor about your partner's potential claim.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Under a previous arrangement between the UK and Manx Tax authorities, double
taxation relief was dealt with by the Manx Assessor of Income Tax under an
Extra Statutory Arrangement. Because of changes made by the UK Authority, I
am informed that this arrangement has been set aside and I must now
personally claim relief from the Inland Revenue.
As I do not understand how double taxation works I should be glad if you
could tell me about any publication which would explain the operation
simply.
Write to the Inland Revenue Claims Branch (International), St John's House,
Merton Road, Bootle, Merseyside, L69 9BB, explaining that you want to claim
the personal allowance and tax credit relief due as an Isle of Man resident.
It will be helpful if you tell them your Manx tax reference and the types of
income which you derive from the UK. You could also ask them for the free
pamphlet on double taxation relief, IR6.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax limit on gifts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF I CHOOSE to give my son money as a gift, what is the annual limit that I
can give without having any tax liability? He has a National Savings number.
Could I, for example, make over a maturing certificate to his number without
difficulty or penalty?
You are able to make an annual gift of Pounds 3,000 out of your annual
exemption for inheritance tax purposes. If you have not made a gift in the
previous tax year to April 5 1993, then you can double the gift to Pounds
6,000 to take account of the past year's relief.
In previous replies, I have also made reference to the possibility of
providing gifts out of income; but it would appear that you wish to make a
one-off gift which might not fall into this category.
It would be possible for you to make the gift by transferring the proceeds
from a maturing National Savings certificate to your son. But if you are
still holding the certificate, you should check the extension rate as it
might not be competitive and it could be better to transfer the money into a
new certificate.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: A setback for the Revenue -
Expatriates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DONALD ELKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE YEARS ago, a sudden change in the Inland Revenue's views on the
taxability of offshore portfolio bonds (OPBs), caught many current and
former expatriates by surprise.
Since, the authorities have been vigorously pursuing claims for the tax
which they consider to be due. Some investors have paid. But for most, the
matter remains unresolved.
OPBs are theoretically single premium life assurance policies although they
are primarily investments. By transferring a portfolio of stocks and shares,
unit trusts, gilts and so on to an offshore insurance company in return for
the issue of a bond, investors could retain the right to manage their
investments while - so it was thought - enjoying the tax treatment of a
single premium life policy.
Such treatment is that no liability to tax arises until you take benefits
from the bonds - and not even then provided you keep within the so called
'premium allowance' which permits drawings each year of 5 per cent of the
sum originally invested.
Clearly, since the insurance companies, being based offshore, are beyond the
reach of the Inland Revenue, such arrangements enable you to avoid tax
altogether for extended periods, even when you are resident in the UK and
drawing a 5 per cent 'income' from your bonds.
It was, no doubt, this, combined with the fact that considerable sums were
being invested, which attracted the attention of the Inland Revenue. Its
reaction was to claim that a 60-year-old piece of anti-avoidance legislation
 -currently Section 739 of the 1988 Taxes Act - was applicable.
If correct, this would strike at the heart of OPBs by enabling the taxing
authorities to 'look through' the bond and charge tax on the underlying
income in all years during which you are ordinarily resident in the UK.
But the legislation itself contains exemptions which negate the operation of
the section. To benefit, you must prove to the satisfaction of the Inland
Revenue either:
(a)'that avoiding taxation was not the purpose or one of the purposes of
acquiring the bond', or
(b)'that its acquisition was a bona fide commercial transaction, not
designed for the purpose of avoiding tax.'
It has gradually become clear that the Inland Revenue's views are by no
means unassailable. Can the Section be made to apply to a bondholder who,
while ordinarily resident in the UK now, did not have that status when the
bond was acquired?
Indeed, those negotiating with the Inland Revenue Special Investigations
Section, might well have felt that they were partaking in a dialogue of the
deaf. All arguments were politely turned aside and the 'party line'
reiterated.
However, Royal Life International and Matheson PFC report that a client of
theirs has succeeded in an appeal brought before the Special Commissioners.
All assessments raised by the Inspector of Taxes have, it seems, been
discharged.
This is a substantial breakthrough, even though such appeal decisions are
not binding in any but the case of the taxpayer concerned and are not even
officially reported.
Most importantly, the Special Commissioners found that Section 739 cannot
apply in the case of a bond effected by an individual at a time when he was
not ordinarily resident in the UK. Although that conclusion is directly
contrary to the decision reached by the Court of Appeal for Northern Ireland
in the case of Herdman v IRC in 1967, it had for some years been doubtful
whether that remained good law.
Any lingering doubts were eliminated by referring - as a recent House of
Lords decision makes clear may be done - to the statements of W S Morrison
in the course of the 1936 Finance Bill debates, when Section 739 was first
enacted.
For good measure, the appellant also convinced the commissioners that he was
entitled to exemption from the section as well. His aim had been to provide
for his retirement and although taxation was taken into account, avoiding
tax was not held to be one of the purposes for which the bond was effected.
It was also held to be a bona fide commercial transaction.
If you are an OPB holder and acquired your bond while resident overseas,
this is certainly good news. Nevertheless, celebrations are, for the moment,
premature. Not surprisingly, perhaps, the Inland Revenue has begun
preparations which might lead to a High Court challenge on points of law,
although the Special Commissioners' findings on matters of fact in this
particular case, cannot be overturned.
Consequently, until the situation clarifies, anyone intending to return to
the UK for residence at some time in the future, would be unwise to make
investments of this type.
Without doubt, however, the Inland Revenue has suffered a severe setback.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The sparkle in a fund manager's eye -
International bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL bond fund managers are full of good reasons for forgetting
gilts and investing in fixed interest bonds issued by governments other than
the UK.
Their enthusiasm is unsurprising given the relatively high returns achieved
in this sector. The performance figures for the largest 10 international
bond funds in the table, produced by Micropal, show an average return of
just under 19 per cent over the year to May 1 - a return assisted in part by
sterling's decline. Fund managers predict more to come.
'Over the last two years, international bond funds have performed
fantastically well,' said Tim Kay, investment manager for Baring's Global
Trust. 'Our view on gilts is that there is not much more scope for prices to
move upwards. The current return is probably only the coupon, that is, 7-8
per cent for medium maturities. International bonds are attractive because
of the possibility of making capital gains from the European markets and
currency gains from the dollar. We see the dollar strengthening against
sterling.'
The theory is that current UK interest rates have bottomed out or are very
near the bottom giving limited scope for capital gains but the slide in
interest rates has only recently begun in Europe. In addition, international
bond funds give their managers scope for currency plays which the sterling
denominated gilts market cannot offer.
Martin Wooller, director of fixed income at Fidelity Investments, believes
that European currencies will be weak against the dollar for the next two
years. Some 83 per cent of Fidelity's international bond fund exposure is to
dollars while 60 per cent of the fund is invested in European bonds.
Yields have fallen since we last published the table on April 24, reflecting
the move into recession in Europe, according to Wooller. Although a fall in
interest rates in Europe offer the potential for capital growth, yields
averaging 5.9 per cent for the funds listed in the table, are no longer
appealingly high for those looking principally for income.
'Investors now think that the yield on bond products is low,' acknowledged
Kay, 'but we go for total return.' He believes that bond funds should be
used by investors as a low risk investment as one part of a portfolio to
bring down the overall risk without reducing the yield greatly.
One fund which aims to deliver a high yield and is not a total return fund
is Guinness Flight's EMU trust, which invests solely in European bonds. The
9.2 per cent yield is achieved through its holding in Spanish peseta bonds
(28 per cent), Italian bonds (25 per cent), sterling bonds (15 per cent),
ECU bonds (12 per cent, Danish kroner bonds (10 per cent) and French bonds
(9 per cent).
The performance is significantly weaker than the other funds listed, usually
the consequence of choosing between income or capital growth. Philip
Saunders, director Guinness Flight Global Asset Management, mainly
attributes the lower performance to the fund's investment restriction to
Europe.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pep cheer from BT3
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is encouraging the use of Personal Equity Plans in the
forthcoming offer of shares in British Telecom, known as BT3. Better terms
for Pep investors will be available in that part of the offer known as the
'retail tender'.
Those who apply via the retail tender will be able to submit bids on the
same basis as institutional investors. Private investors will be able to
participate in the tender through one of around 100 stockbrokers or
financial intermediaries.
The plus point of this process is that they have the chance of buying
significant amounts of shares; the minus point is that any incentives and
discounts under the public offer will not be available via the tender.
The minimum investment for Peps under the retail tender will be Pounds
1,500, lower than the (yet-to-be-set) minimum for those who apply outside a
Pep. Managers will also be required to make no initial charges on
investments in new Peps used to acquire BT shares in the retail tender.
Investors who go for shares in the public offer will also be able to
transfer their shares into Peps. However, past privatisations have resulted
in some small allocations for those who apply through the public offer.
The marketing campaign for the sale of the third tranche of shares in BT
starts next week with dealing expected to begin in July.

THE MUSIC industry is in the news with the announcement that the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission is to investigate the price of compact discs. On
Tuesday, Thorn EMI, one of the biggest music companies in the world, is due
to announce its full-year results and any comments on CD prices by Sir Colin
Southgate, the chairman, will be regarded with interest.
Under the old accounting system, pre-tax profits of Pounds 330m are expected
compared with Pounds 255.1m in the previous year. This does not take
account, however, of exceptional items relating to Thames Television, which
the group recently sold to Pearson. With results reported under FRS3, this
and exceptional items related to smaller disposals will be included.
Supermarket stocks have been in the doldrums recently as investors have
focused on recovery plays and Argyll Group, the UK's third largest food
retailing group, is no exception. The stock has been trading around its lows
for the year.
Nevertheless Argyll, which runs the Safeway and Presto / Lo-Cost chains, is
expected to report a rise of as much as 15 per cent in full (53-week) year
pre-tax profits to between Pounds 415m and Pounds 420m when it announces its
results on Tuesday - continuing a remarkable six-year period of growth.
On Wednesday, Courtaulds is expected to report pre-tax profits for the year
to March of about Pounds 190m, down from Pounds 201m a year earlier. Of
interest will be the impact of sterling's devaluation on its exports. But a
cheaper pound will also mean higher debt.
Carlton Communications reports on Monday, forecasts are of a modest increase
in interim pre-tax profits to about Pounds 53m from Pounds 49m. The
improvement will be in spite of an operating loss of about Pounds 5m by
Carlton Television, the new London weekday ITV franchise. The loss will
reflect start up costs and weak advertising revenues.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The rising cost of paying for Burglar
Bill - Scheherazade Daneshkhu contemplates the increase in insurance
premiums on home contents and tells you how to cut the costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEACE of mind is becoming an ever more expensive commodity. Home contents
insurance premiums are estimated by the Association of British Insurers to
have risen by 20-25 per cent over the last 12 months, for the second year
running.
The main reason for premium increases has been claims resulting from the
rise in crime. The cost of theft from homes has increased by more than 200
per cent since the end of 1989, to Pounds 749m in 1992. Insurance companies
predict more but lower increases for the next year.
AA forecasts a rise of 10-15 per cent in the next 12 months. Royal Insurance
foresees increases of up to 9 per cent but General Accident says it does not
expect any premium rises over the next year.
But many homeowners may be asking why they should be shouldering the burden
of the rising crime rate when insurance companies are once again making
profits.
Commercial Union, General Accident and Guardian Royal Exchange are all back
in profit. Three other large general insurers, Eagle Star, Royal Insurance
and Sun Alliance, have been dragged down by their exposure to mortgage
indemnity claims, but should record profits within the next 18 months.
Insurance companies have been able to push through such large increases in
premiums because competition in the industry has declined.
Over the past year, companies have concentrated on tightening underwriting
by using more selective rating methods, reducing premiums for customers who
agree to a higher excess and restricting cover, rather than trying to expand
market share.
'Basically, insurance companies are more prepared to admit that the race for
market share meant they accepted risks which were poorly priced. Now, more
realistic premiums are being charged and the companies are less worried
about customers going to another company,' said the ABI.
Insurers have moved towards 'smarter pricing' by rewarding those with a low
claims history, through the use of discounts, leaving the higher-risk
customers to meet ever-increasing premiums.
'We have needed to respond to rising claims but we have tried to do it in a
selective way and we are not looking to put through major increases,' said
Prudential.
The 'direct writers' which sell to the public over the telephone in the
method pioneered by Royal Bank of Scotland's Direct Line, are as cautious
about bad risks in the home contents market as they are in their main
industry, motor insurance. Churchill, for example, will not take on anyone
who has made two or more claims from its insurance company in the last five
years.
In spite of the fall in competitive pressure, there is a wide variation on
premiums quoted for postcoded areas as the table shows. Although the claims
for the area in which you live will be the main determinant of the size of
premiums, it is possible to reduce premiums, according to a number of
criteria.
Age. Many companies will give a lower quotation to those aged 50 and above.
Direct Line says its premiums fall by about 5 per cent for this age group
while Royal Insurance will reduce premiums by about 15 per cent. Prudential
will give a 20 per cent reduction to those 50 and above, having reduced the
age from 60 years.
'Those who are over 50 are a better risk and tend to be at home more often.
We want to pick up more business in this area and retain customers of this
age,' said Prudential. Age Concern offers a special home and contents
insurance package aimed at those who are 60 years and over but the contents
are insured to a maximum of Pounds 20,000.
No claims discount. Apart from no claims bonuses, many companies will give
incentives to those who do not make claims. General Accident says that it
will take up to 25 per cent off gross premiums for someone who has a record
of no claims over four years. Churchill says it reduces premiums by up to 20
per cent for those with no claims in a three-year period and Eagle Star
offers reductions of up to 20 per cent for a five-year period.
Excesses. Most home contents policies have an excess of at least Pounds 50.
Homeowners can often reduce premiums if they agree to a higher excess. For
example, General Accident will reduce premiums by 20 per cent for a Pounds
250 excess; Countrywide will give 15 per cent off for a Pounds 100 excess,
25 per cent off for Pounds 250 excess and Pounds 30 per cent off for an
excess of Pounds 350.
Security. Many companies will reduce premiums for those who are members of
Neighbourhood Watch. General Accident, which last year sponsored Crime
Concern's Neighbourhood Watch conference, is the most generous giving
reductions of up to 40 per cent for those who are members and pass security
checks.
By contrast, Prudential does not set great store by neighbourhood watches,
preferring to give discounts of 10 per cent for fitting locks recommended by
the Master Locksmiths Association and a discount of 10 per cent off the
installation of the locks. Eagle Star, Countrywide and Cornhill also reduce
premiums by about 10 per cent for fitting recommended locks. Some companies
will not quote unless minimum security measures are met.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: 'Lodger cover' blow for a puzzled
landlady
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JANE ANDREWS* has had a number of surprises since she decided to take in a
lodger in February. She wanted to take advantage of the government's
rent-a-room scheme, under which people who let a furnished room in their
home are not be taxed on the first Pounds 3,250 of rent. The scheme is one
of the government's measures aimed at reviving the private rental sector.
She wrote to Halifax building society, her mortgage lender, to let them know
that she was taking in a lodger. Halifax requested details of her tax office
and national insurance number to check with the Inland Revenue that her
eligibility for tax relief would not be lost.
Her first surprise came when she received a letter from the society
consenting 'to your request to allow another person (the Lodger) to share
occupation of your mortgaged property with you.'
'My letter was written to advise them of a change - not requesting their
permission,' said Andrews. A further surprise was to come in the last
paragraph of the letter: a request for a Pounds 50 administration fee.
When she called her branch manager to protest, he said that she had been
sent a standard letter and did not need to pay the Pounds 50. 'He also said
that if customers like myself telephoned to query the charge, they were told
they did not have to pay and if customers sent a cheque, then they accepted
it]' said Andrews.
Halifax said this week that the Pounds 50 charge is to cover administration
costs when the society consents to borrowers for establishing a tenancy
agreement, or to lodgers staying at the property. It said that the
information given to Andrews 'was unfortunately incorrect and for this we
apologise.'
Andrews also wrote to her insurance company, Commercial Union, to let it
know that she had taken in a lodger. After two months she received a letter
which said her existing Key home contents policy could not be continued and
enclosed details instead of a new policy - Guesthouse.
Andrews was distressed since the letter gave her the impression that her
policy had been cancelled. Moreover, the new Guesthouse policy seemed
unsuitable since she did not have a liquor licence and was only taking in
one lodger.
'They said they were sorry if my letter was misleading as they had not
cancelled my policy but an endorsement had been imposed, which stated that
loss or damage caused by theft would not be covered unless violent means
were used to enter the home,' she said. This endorsement is standard
practice in the insurance industry.
'I find it ridiculous that my lodger can insure his goods against me but I
cannot get an all-risks cover, even though I am prepared to pay more for
it,' said Andrews. 'On the one hand, the government encourages people to
take in lodgers by relaxing the tax rules, yet on the other hand, insurance
companies block this by not taking the risk.'
Of the 10 companies approached (see table), Royal Insurance indicated the
greatest flexibility by being prepared to maintain the same level of cover
on a case by case basis.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Markets: Used endowments, handle with care - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENDOWMENT policies are not my favourite type of investment, as regular
readers will realise. They are not a bad product - just a product which best
suits a limited number of people but which, over the past decade, has been
mass marketed.
Most commentators have welcomed the growth of the second-hand endowment
market. It addresses one of the fundamental problems with endowment policies
 -inflexibility. Twenty-five years is a long time to wait for your number to
come up - as Manchester United supporters can attest.
During that quarter of a century, you are dependent on the investment
performance of one management group - you cannot transfer the funds to a
better-performing insurance company.
Until the emergence of the second-hand market, the options for disillusioned
policyholders were limited. They could make the policy paid up, which
prevented them from sending good money after bad, but locked up their cash.
Or they could surrender the policy and take their chance on the surrender
value. This value tended to be limited because of the insurance companies'
desire to recoup the costs of selling the policy (including the commission
paid to the salesman or adviser).
Now policyholders can auction their policies, or sell them to a
market-maker, and hope to receive more than the insurance company is willing
to pay. As well as giving investors a choice the second-hand market is thus
creating competition - something which, even in these post-Thatcherite days,
is generally perceived as a good thing.
Furthermore, the evidence of surveys such as that recently conducted by
Money Marketing indicates that surrender values have been improving. This
could be owing to the competition from the second-hand market, or it could
be a response to media criticism of low payouts. Whatever the reason, it is
good news.
The second-hand market seems, then, to have benefited policyholders who
sell. But Standard Life this week raised the question of whether investors
who buy the second hand policies are getting a good deal.
The company has decided to write to people who buy its policies second-hand
and tell them that 'where a policy has been purchased from its original
owner, the overall return to the new owner will depend not only on the
bonuses declared, but also on the purchase price paid. We must make it clear
that, since the price paid is not under our control, we cannot be
responsible if the eventual return, when the policy proceeds are taken, is
considered to be unsatisfactory.'
At the heart of this issue is whether the surrender value paid by Standard
Life is 'fair'. Suppose the fair value of a policy after 10 years was Pounds
10,000. If Standard Life offered a surrender value of only Pounds 8,000,
then a policyholder could sell his policy for Pounds 9,000. He would be in
profit and so would the buyer - since he would have bought a policy with a
fair value of Pounds 10,000 for Pounds 9,000.
Standard Life, however, believes that the surrender values it pays are fair.
In other words, second-hand investors are paying Pounds 9,000 for policies
worth only Pounds 8,000.
'Bonus rates have been reduced and, if investment returns remain low in the
future, further reductions can be expected. Coupled with an unrealistic
initial price being paid for a policy, this could lead to the purchaser
feeling dissatisfied with the return achieved at the end of the day,' the
company says.
Given that Standard Life is one of the most respected companies in the
insurance industry, and one of the best performers, these views carry
weight. And they provoked a quick response from Policy Portfolio, one
second-hand market-maker, which produced a six point rebuttal. In essence,
its argument is that returns from second-hand policies will still be good,
may not be available elsewhere and that, in any case, the risks are clearly
spelt out to investors.
The surrender value of an endowment policy is something which actuaries can
(and do) debate at length. Christopher Dobie of Beale Dobie, another firm in
the second-hand endowment market, points out that, after 15 years of a 25
year policy, Equitable Life can pay out 28 per cent more than Standard Life.
But has the second-hand market grown too quickly for its own good? There
still seems plenty of demand. Kleinwort Benson's Endowment Policy Trust,
which raised Pounds 30m to invest in second-hand policies in July 1992, is
only 50 per cent invested and has admitted that its purchasing programme has
been slower than expected. BZW and Beale Dobie are to launch a Pounds 20m
offshore fund with similar investment aims. The extent of future supply is
harder to assess; with interest rates low, fewer borrowers will be forced
into surrendering; on the other hand if bonus rates fall, more investors may
be disillusioned.
Those considering buying second-hand policies should remember the
'smoothing' nature of with profits policies. The evidence is that insurance
companies paid too much in 1989 and 1990 and have yet to redress the
balance. Thus future bonus rates could well be lower than if the insurance
companies had started with a clean slate. Standard Life has done the
industry a service by highlighting the issue.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Markets: Marks sparks retail revival - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Richard Greenbury, Marks and Spencer's chairman, could scarcely hide his
irritation this week at suggestions that the City of London thought M and S
shares were a good recession stock, but 'boring' once the recovery began.
'On any track record evaluation that's a lot of old rubbish,' was his
immediate reaction.
'We will do as well next year, and the year after that . . . as the goods we
buy, the price we charge for them and the service we give. If we get it
right we will do well and if we make a mess we will do badly,' was his more
considered follow-up.
It is difficult to quarrel with either statement. This week's results from
Marks and Spencer were impressive by any standards. Pre-tax profits
increased 25 per cent to Pounds 737m, making M and S once again the UK's
most profitable retailer, although turnover increased only 3 per cent.
The profit increase was flattered by the fact that last year's figure was
reduced by exceptional costs of more than Pounds 80m, according to the new
FRS3 accounting standard. But even stripping out those costs, profits were
up 10 per cent.
Profits and margins rose in the UK even after the company froze prices for
three-quarters of its clothing range and reduced them for the rest, and its
overseas businesses all enjoyed sales and profits increases.
Sir Richard's point is that a company that can do this well in a recession,
provided it continues to get the formula right - a safe bet  - can hardly
fail to benefit from an upturn in consumer spending.
Quite right, say the analysts. But other retailers starting from a lower
base and only just recovering from over-expansion and mismanagement in the
late 1980s may grow at an even faster rate.
One of them is Storehouse, which reported on Thursday. The improvement in
its fortunes was obscured by exceptional charges of Pounds 34.1m relating to
losses on last year's sale of the Richards and Habitat chains. Without
those, pre-tax profits would have tripled to Pounds 46.6m, while operating
profits for its remaining BhS and Mothercare chains quadrupled.
There is still room for improvement. Ann Iverson, Mothercare chief
executive, is looking for increases in market share and margins and her past
record suggests she can deliver. Reforms continue at BhS and refurbishment
of some stores this year may help lift sales.
A more risky bet, but still a recovery story, is Burton, which 10 days ago
announced a 13.3 per cent improvement in interim profits to Pounds 24.7m,
and sales up 14.3 per cent to Pounds 1.07bn.
John Hoerner, chief executive, has attacked the cost base through
wide-ranging rationalisation and increased part-time working. If he can
continue to improve efficiency, he may start to unlock the potential of a
company which has annual sales of Pounds 2bn but achieves net margins of
only 3 per cent - compared with M and S's 12.5 per cent.
The problem is that recent sales increases have been stimulated largely
through lowering prices, resulting in a 2.3 point drop in gross margins  - a
vicious circle it may be difficult to break out of.
Other clothing retailers are pulling through after life-saving surgery.
Next, which helped transform the face of the high street in the 1980s before
running into problems as it over-expanded, more than tripled pre-tax profits
last month with retail sales up 18 per cent. It believes it can increase
sales per square foot in its stores by another third.
In addition to the clothing retailers, some say stores such as Argos, MFI
and Dixons are set to benefit strongly from a consumer-led recovery, and
especially a pick-up in the housing market.
So where does that leave M and S? The growth prospects may not match that of
some other stores, if their own and the general economic recovery continues.
But few companies can offer such safe, steady growth. M and S is run
superbly, and in the past five years turnover has risen 30 per cent, pre-tax
profits 47 per cent and dividends 59 per cent.
As one stores analyst put it: 'If I was allowed to, I'd be buying the pants
off this one.'

FT  22 MAY 93 / Markets: Bank stocks; flying so high, falling so low - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WILD and unpredictable swings in share prices this year weeks have left
investors understandably light-headed, and none more so than those who
follow the banking sector.
If the market as a whole has taken investors on a roller-coaster ride,
investors in bank stocks must feel as if they have been strapped into the
back seat of a jet fighter during an aerial stunt routine.
During the first quarter bank shares reached for the sky, with the index of
bank stocks compiled by broking house Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods rising 12 per
cent in the first three months of the year. It easily outpaced the 3.6 per
cent return on the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and the 4.1 per cent return on the
Dow Jones industrial average.
Around mid-April, however, the bank sector fell into a dramatic nosedive,
and by the end of this week the 12 per cent gain recorded by the Keefe,
Bruyette index had suddenly shrunk to a meagre 2 per cent gain. In contrast,
after this week's record-breaking rally, the Dow was up 6.7 per cent and the
S&amp;P 500 up 3.4 per cent on the year.
So, what is wrong with the banks? They have been the centre of attention for
the best part of this year because a dominant influence on market sentiment
has been a growing fear of a rising inflation rate and higher interest
rates, factors which affect banks more directly than any other industry
sector.
Thus, when investor anxiety over last week's bad inflation numbers peaked
this week - at the moment the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee was
meeting in Washington DC to discuss whether to change monetary policy in
light of the inflation data - bank stocks were in the centre of the
firestorm.
Of course, bank stocks have fallen so far because they flew so high in the
first place. Three factors were behind the first quarter boom in the banking
sector: an industry-wide consolidation process that was producing big
mergers and takeovers; an improvement in earnings following cost-cutting
programmes and a major clean-up of balance sheets; and low domestic interest
rates, which boosted banks interest margins - the highly profitable
difference between the low interest rates banks pay to depositors on their
short-term assets and the higher rates banks earn on their loans and longer
term investments.
These factors, plus the realisation that the big money-centre banks in New
York and San Francisco had put the worst of the Latin America debt crisis
behind them, contributed to a feeding frenzy in the sector.
After mid-April, however, the of feeding frenzy turned into a selling
frenzy. Some damage can be attributed to profit-taking in the wake of a
first quarter reporting season that displayed strong earnings across the
industry.
According to figures compiled by American Banker, net profits at the top 25
banks in the US were 56 per cent higher in the first quarter of 1993 than in
the same quarter a year earlier. That sharp improvement was achieved in the
wake of a big drop in banks' non-performing assets (down from 2.89 per cent
of all assets to 2.06 per cent) and a widening in banks' average interest
margin of 17 basis-points.
As is often the case, after companies have announced profits that matched or
exceeded expectations, investors sell some of their holdings to lock-in
gains earned on the good earnings news.
Yet the decline in bank stocks was about much more than profit-taking. Given
that widening interest margins were a key factor in the strong earnings
reports, it was not surprising that when anxiety about higher short-term
interest rates took hold, investors, fearing a big squeeze on bank interest
margins, began to bale out of banks.
Now that the scare over interest rates has temporarily abated, the future
should look rosier for bank stocks. Not necessarily. Investors worry that
continued weak demand for bank loans, a slowdown in the pace of industry
consolidation, and doubts about banks' ability to sustain recent earnings
improvements, make the sector unattractive over the intermediate-term.
Ironically, investors are shunning bank stocks at a time when Wall Street
remains relatively bullish on the sector. In the past week several big
brokerage houses, including Salomon Brothers and Smith Barney, have put out
buy recommendations on bank stocks.
And James McDermott, of Keefe, Bruyette forecasts that earnings per share
from the 140 banks he covers will be up 15 per cent in the second quarter of
this year. If investors begin to take note of his, and other analysts',
optimism, bank stocks could soon be heading for the skies again.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Scottish Widows bond reissued - At a
Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Widows has made a new issue of its Monthly Income Bond, which was
criticised by some advisers when launched last year. As before, the bond
consists of an annuity and a personal equity plan. The annuity pays the
income - equivalent to a net 9.11 per cent per annum on the total invested -
while the Pep is designed to grow to repay the annuity. But there is no
guarantee that it will do so - the capital value of the units in the Pep
will need to grow at 7.75 per cent per annum for this to be achieved - so
this is far from a risk-free investment. It is good to see that Scottish
Widows' brochure makes this very clear.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Banks shake off dust of ages - At a
Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The banking sector has come out of the doldrums. After 16 years of lagging
behind the FT-A All-Share Index, the FT-Actuaries Bank Index this week moved
ahead. Throughout the 1980s, bank shares were depressed by bad Third World
loans and were hit again by the recession. But the addition of Hong Kong &amp;
Shanghai Bank to the sector, and the perception that profits are set to
recover, have led to a rally in the sector's relative rating.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Gold price riding a speculative
rollercoaster - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold prices had a topsy-turvy week with the US dollar price touching Dollars
384.50 a troy ounce on Wednesday, its highest level since the panic buying
just after the start of the Gulf War in January 1991.
The price of gold has rebounded from a seven-year low of Dollars 327 an
ounce in London on the first trading day of 1993. The rise during the past
four weeks has been partly inspired by high-profile investors Sir James
Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier, and George Soros, the US investment
fund manager.
However, the gold price fell back from the Wednesday peak, with some
investors taking profits, and dropped to around Dollars 373 an ounce on
Friday.

MUSIC: Wouldn't you like to get away, where everybody knows your na-a-ame,

All: Norm]
Norman: No beer today, Woody, gimme a bottle of cheap champagne.
Cliff: Celebrating, huh, Norm?
Norman: You know like in those movie car chases where the bad guy is right
on the tail of the good guy? Then the good guy yanks the wheel and the bad
guy goes straight on, over the edge of the canyon, splat, boom, kerpow]
Woody: You been taking driving lessons again, Mr Lamont?
Norman: The office, Woody] This Portillo guy, supposed to work for me but
all the time his fan-club is trying to push me out and him in.
Cliff: Some kind of Spanish hotshot, huh? You know, your second generation
immigrants, they got a success drive . . .
Norman (interrupts): No successful driving for him. Crashed and burned,
total write-off.
Frasier: Norman, I'm very concerned by this display of Schadenfreude.
Woody: Bless you]
Frasier: It's not healthy taking malicious pleasure when misfortune strikes
out of the blue.
Norman: Whaddaya mean, out of the blue? You think there wasn't some planning
here?
Carla: Great, a stab in the back, I love it. What did you do, Normie,
boobytrap his desk? Bug his bedroom? Itching powder in his shorts?
Norman: Nothing so crude, Carla. I gave him the chance to make his name by
tackling the issue of the decade.
Woody: What issue's that, Mr Lamont?
Norman: You know this government deficit crisis thing me and the boss
stumbled into?
Carla: Yeah, yeah, you bored us with that already.
Norman: Well, I said to this Portillo kid, I'll raise the taxes, you cut the

kinda stuff.
Frasier (awestruck): You told him to be brave?

Rebecca: Forget it, Sam. I'm not that desperate.
Sam: Still hung up on that Robin guy, the English banker, huh? What's he got
that I haven't?
Rebecca: A way with words, Sam. You think metonomy is a gang-bang with the
opera.
Sam: Oh yeah? If he's so good, gimme a f'rinstance.
Rebecca: Here are the last words he sent.
Sam: He writes you letters?
Rebecca: Kind of a quarterly bulletin. (Reads)
'On balance, the changes since the last inflation report have lowered
slightly both the expected inflation rate and the probability of breaching
the 4 per cent limit during the course of the year.' Stylish, huh?
Sam: Gimme that. This guy can't make up his mind about anything. How about
this: 'The impact next year of the Budget measures, together with the
uncertainties surrounding the rate at which the output gap is likely to
narrow, suggest that the probability of breaching the target next year may
be a little greater than previously envisaged, but the Bank's central
expectation still is that the target will be met.'
Rebecca: I call it a very balanced judgment.
Sam: Sure, sure. But this economist I met at the races said the Brits will
have a nasty shock when they realise your pal Robin's hinting there's a
chance underlying inflation could be getting on for 5 per cent next year.
Maybe that's why he wants the crummy pound a bit stronger.
Rebecca: He's scribbled a personal message at the end: April RPI: 1.3 per
cent. Sweet]
Sam: You want numbers? How's this for a number: 9 1/2 per cent. That's what
my economist buddy says long gilts will be yielding next year, compared with
8 1/2 now. Put that in your market valuations.
Rebecca: Sam, I preferred it when you stuck to baseball.

Cliff: Remember those Saatchi guys, the two brothers, used to come in here
all the time trying to buy up the pictures?
Carla: Yeah, one time they paid Dollars 500,000 in stock for Woody's

Cliff: Well, I ran into one of them today, said he was back for a
fund-raiser.
(Phone rings)
Woody (answering). Hey, Mr Saatchi] Yes, I've still got the stock, is it
worth anything? Only one-thirtieth of what it was in 1987? Gee, that's too
bad. And now you want me to pay you some money? Ten for every 27? What kind
of a deal d'you call that? A rights issue? Hey, I'm not that dumb.
Frasier: Very sensible, Woody.
Woody: Me and the guys at the Scottish Providential, we're kinda short at
the moment. Blew our wads last year on a few of those sure-thing rights
issues. Now we've got to stump up for the phone company and help ol' Norm
out of a hole.
Norman: That reminds me, Woody - put another Pounds 3bn on the slate. I'll
pay you back next century. Can I use the phone?
Woody: Why not? You and the rights issue guys are already into me for all my
spare cash.
Norman (on phone): Hey Ken, have you thought about turning the police force
over to Group 4? Great] (Hangs up.)
Woody: More champagne?
Norman: Make it a jeroboam. You ever have days when everything seems to go
right?

FT  22 MAY 93 / The Long View: Greenback blues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO FAR this year the score for conventional wisdom in the foreign exchange
market appears to be one hit, two misses.
The safe bets for 1993 were that the dollar and the yen would go up and the
D-mark would drop. Sure enough, the yen has duly done its stuff, rising 12
per cent on the basis of its trade-weighted index so far this year (and by
25 per cent since its low point last August). But there are some very stale
bulls around of the dollar (down 3 per cent since the end of December) and
some very unsatisfied bears of the D-Mark (down 1 per cent).
It is a reminder, perhaps, that when currencies are floating freely the
foreign exchange market is likely to come up with some reasonably sensible
answers, and will certainly not make life easy for forecasters or corporate
treasurers. How different is the rigged situation in the European Monetary
System, which last week endured its latest little upset (although the EC
continues to assure us that the ERM would work wonderfully if only the
politicians behaved sensibly).
It is interesting to remember that a year ago, before the first Danish
referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, the Spanish peseta was bursting through
the top of its ERM fluctuation band because it was a higher-yielding D-Mark
(no risk, extra return). Since then it has been devalued three times (and
has even depreciated against sterling).
Of course, foreign currency traders who base their decisions on patterns in
the five-minute charts cannot be expected to come up with sensible long-term
parities. But the standard views on the dollar and the D-Mark have been
based on perfectly reasonable economic projections: that a US recovery would
in due course lead to a tightening of monetary policy and a rise in bond
yields, while on the other hand the slide into German economic decline would
trigger sharp cuts in interest rates and a perceived need for a
significantly lower exchange rate in order to permit an economic revival not
only in Germany but right across Continental Europe.
These views have not yet been proven wrong, but they are getting dog-eared.
The American recovery, for instance, has been disappointing. It is normal
enough for the pace of a cyclical recovery to slacken after an early spurt,
but the 1.8 per cent GDP growth in the first quarter was unimpressive.
And although the long bond yield has duly risen - it topped 7 per cent
briefly this week - the US Treasury is so dependent on a steep yield curve
to persuade the banking system to finance its fiscal deficit that short-term
rates seem likely to stay low for some time. So holders of dollars will
continue to suffer an income disadvantage.
As for Germany, the Bundesbank continues to fight a dogged rearguard action,
worried about 4.3 per cent inflation and overshooting monetary growth. It
passed up this week's chance to cut its official interest rates further.
The Danish 'yes' vote was thought likely to erode some of the german
currency's safe haven appeal, but in the event the movements have been
modest. If the D-Mark is indeed poised on the edge of a cliff it is
certainly not suffering from vertigo.
But from a global perspective the economic weakness of Europe and the
overvaluation of several of its currencies are what stand out at present.
The European Commission is now forecasting negative economic growth for the
Community as a whole in 1993.
Nevertheless, huge trade deficits are looming, of 2 to 3 per cent of GDP for
Germany and the UK (and perhaps 1 1/2 per cent for the EC as a whole). A
major source of this imbalance is Japan, which is running a surplus of about
3 per cent of GDP; the appreciation of the yen is a logical consequence. But
the growing competitiveness of developing countries around the world -
especially China - also seems to be an important factor.
The pattern of mature economies suffering a destabilising degree of import
penetration is also, after all, seen in the US, where the trade deficit
jumped to Dollars 10.2bn in March, giving another jolt to the dollar bulls.
Europe is notably reluctant, however, to live without cheap imports: they
may destroy jobs but they also hold down the cost of living. The Bundesbank
has a duty to put the purchasing power of the D-Mark before other economic
priorities, and in the UK similar concerns clearly emerged in this week's
quarterly Inflation Report from the Bank of England.
The 6 per cent rally in the sterling exchange rate since February, said the
Bank, has improved the chances that the government's 4 per cent inflation
ceiling will not be breached next year, but any decline in the value of the
pound from here would put the target in peril.
In the end, however, attempts to hold national living standards at levels
which are not being earned are bound to end in failure. If it tries, Europe
will be overwhelmed by a twin deficit problem, with both budget gaps and
trade gaps.
But at what point will this come to dominate the foreign exchange markets?
In the short run, as we saw with the peseta last year, the markets barely
look beyond interest rates. But in other circumstances, and quite suddenly,
they might look at economic credibility instead. The deficits would have to
be cured, not just financed.
For the moment, however, the currency with perhaps the worst twin deficit
problem of the lot, sterling, has actually been edging up. Yet it is
possible to detect early signs of crisis in the surprising strength of those
traditional safe havens, gold and the Swiss franc. And German bond yields
have been rising, which could be an indication that foreign investors are
getting restless.
If you switched out of D-Marks into dollars at the end of last year at a
rate of 1.62 you have yet to show a profit. But hold on a bit longer, the
markets may see it your way soon.

FT  22 MAY 93 / A very polite middle-class mutiny at sea: What does it take
to make one of a number of identical boats go faster? Keith Wheatley has
been talking to some of the participants in the round the world yacht race
as it nears the finish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAWN HAD yet to break. The yacht's skipper and off-watch crew were still
sleeping as a slight hunched figure sent a coded radio message via satellite
back to the market town of Petersfield in southern England. Recipient Chay
Blyth knew from the pre-arranged sequence of words that he had a polite,
middle-class mutiny on his hands.
Aboard Commercial Union, one of 10 identical 67ft yachts taking part in
Blyth's brainchild, the British Steel Challenge round the world race were 14
individuals. The skipper Will Sutherland was an experienced racing sailor
employed by Blyth's company to take the boat safely round the 28,000 mile
course.
However, the crew had paid nearly Pounds 15,000 each to be part of this
extraordinary adventure. They had trained and dreamt of the Challenge for
nearly two years. And they were not happy. This articulate, dedicated group
with shore jobs ranging from company director to steelworker felt that Will
Sutherland was the primary reason why their yacht was trailing over a week
behind the race leaders.
Blyth had received a deputation from Commercial Union and been told of the
crew misgivings just a few days before the race sailed from Southampton last
September. The feisty former paratrooper told them to shape up and shut up -
adding that he would listen to a further well-grounded complaint if the
situation deteriorated on Leg One.
As the yacht, identical in speed and potential to its rivals, slipped
further behind en route to the Rio de Janeiro stopover it was clear that
lack of team-work and morale was the problem. Sutherland left his command in
Rio after a brief interview with Blyth. 'We're all under performance review
in this project and he didn't perform,' explained Blyth simply.
After a race lasting nearly eight months, including stopovers, the fleet is
only hours away from the finish in Southampton. Will the fastest boat win?
This is not a valid question since the hulls and equipment are identical. No
one involved is in any doubt that team-work and the management of human
assets has made the difference between first and last in this unique event.
'Human resources have been the most important factor so far in the results,'
commented Richard Tudor, skipper of British Steel II, before leaving Cape
Town on the final leg. 'You have to manage the characters involved on your
boat. Fair but diplomatic is my aim.'
'There's a clear linkage between the man-management aboard and how they do
in the race,' agreed Blyth. 'I could tell you which are the best-managed
boats in this fleet, we monitor that kind of thing very closely.' Yet this
is motivation and team-building of a very unusual kind. Not only did the
crew-volunteers begin as virtual amateurs in a hostile and potentially
dangerous environment; they were the valued clients, the skippers/managers
the hired hands.
Their labour and efforts could not be directed as in the Services or
business life, with the ultimate sanction of military discipline or
dismissal. John Chittenden, skipper of Nuclear Electric and overall race
leader since Rio, is at 52 the oldest man to command one of the yachts and
is a master mariner by profession.
'When this crew walk off the boat they have to feel happy. When the crew
walk off a merchant ship you don't give a damn what they think as long as
the ship's clean,' commented Chittenden. He has revelled in the company at
sea of his intellectual peers - and superiors. 'There are people aboard this
yacht far cleverer than me. I'd venture to suggest that there's more brain
power aboard Nuclear Electric than in the entire British merchant navy,' he
added.
Almost every convention concerning the command structure at sea and in races
has been stood on its head in the British Steel challenge. The skippers had
no say in choosing their crews. Furthermore they had virtually no
possibility of disposing of people they did not take to.
Blyth's small management team were careful to balance the 13-strong crews
internally by age, sex and even region. However, the crews were allocated to
skippers by ballot. 'They all grumbled about the people they'd been given
initially,' said Blyth. 'They had to mould complete strangers into a team
and they had no authority to throw anyone off except in the absolute direst
circumstances relating to safety.'
Vivien Cherry, the only woman skipper, is fond of saying that the bedrock
problem with many of the crew-volunteers is that 'they have been handed the
Dream on a Plate'. It is a harsh judgment, given that many of the CVs have
struggled desperately to raise the cash to take part. Those that are
affluent have often taken a risky year away from highly-competitive careers
or businesses that need tending.
Yet there is a contrast between the crews who are, ultimately, 'escapists'
and the nuts-and-bolts practicalities of the skippers. All of the latter had
proven abilities in ocean racing, a seamanship qualification sufficient to
satisfy the Department of Trade, and what Blyth describes as 'the most
important point, leadership'. The degree to which the latter has been
effectively deployed has been the story of the race.
Given that coercion has been the only management tool absent from this
nautical situation, it is fascinating to observe that the three leading
skippers all come from a military or near-Services background. However,
their style owes more to the studied informality of the Royal Marines or the
SAS than the eyes-front regime of the Guards, for instance.
Mike Golding is a watch commander in the Berkshire fire service and for the
past year, skipper of Group 4. His boat was comfortable winner of the
Southern Ocean leg from Hobart to Cape Town. As the winds built to 70mph and
the waves reached the size of large houses, the Group 4 crew seemed to revel
in the conditions, increasing their lead over the fleet day by day. After
three legs they were lying second and comfortable.
Golding's crew - all-male and the only such group in the fleet - have the
reputation of being highly disciplined. If so, it can hardly be on the model
of the Fire Service, as Golding freely concedes. 'In my shore job you have a
marvellous thing called the Discipline Code which gives you much more
leverage than you have in the Challenge,' he said.
'The Fire Service tells someone how to do something without query. Here,
especially in the early days, I always had to field the return question
'Why?' Sometimes it's appropriate and sometimes it isn't. Whenever a fire
unit goes operational it's inappropriate to ask questions. You haven't got
time to brief everyone on every aspect.
'On board I've tried to make people realise the the difference between those
types of situation. Early on there was a point when it did seem that
everything you did had to be fully briefed. That stage seemed to take a long
time to get past and it was an important milestone.
'For instance, when we're sailing in what we term 'Protective Mode' in bad
weather and you need to tack the yacht with 55 knots of wind across the
foredeck you don't need someone deciding on a whim to do something a
different way.
'In less stressed circumstances we might well discuss the manoeuvre and
whether there are improvements we can make. The crew can question the menu
but not the watch system, if that makes sense.' Of course, it takes a strong
and confident leader to be able to erect sensible and acceptable boundaries
dividing different areas of team life.
Pete Goss is the commander of Hofbrau Lager. A former Royal Marine and
single-handed racing sailor, Goss has worked for the Challenge since its
inception, running the early training weekends which turned the crew
volunteers from eager landlubbers clutching a cheque to trainee seamen
acceptable to his other skippers.
He became a considerable father-figure to the 130 CVs and there was
significant envy among the 90 per cent who were not balloted to his yacht.
Goss exemplifies the belief central to the Corps that every individual can
find enormous strength through their role in a team. He was a crucial player
in determining the Challenge ethos.
'In the beginning the skipper's word was Law because he was the only one who
knew what was going on,' said Goss, as his crew stowed food for the
five-week voyage from Cape Town to the Solent. 'But after racing over 20,000
miles already they've changed from a spoon-fed group to a highly
professional team.'
He adds that the skippers as a group possibly had the largest identity
crisis of all. They had not selected the crews and their own manager Chay
Blyth often seemed to listen to the clients (who, after all, had paid out a
total of Pounds 2m) or the sponsors (a further Pounds 2.5m) rather than his
own staff.
In contrast to the sophisticated programme devised for the CVs, the skippers
and management from the Challenge Business were left to rub along with one
three-day training weekend at the British Steel business college at
Leamington Spa. 'It wasn't long enough,' admits Blyth now. 'When we run the
next race it will be a two-or-three week course for the skippers.'
Certainly one can be sure that conventional leadership and management
training courses will have been overtaken by what has been learned on this
first race. 'The skipper's personality comes into it much more than in most
management questions because you are living cheek-by-jowl with the rest of
the team for weeks at a time,' reflected Pete Goss, whose yacht has
consistently been within the leaders at every stopover and may still win the
race. 'There are definitely different style from boat to boat and the key
determinant is the skipper.'
Richard Tudor, a former sailmaker who started his own business at the age of
18, had possibly the worst crisis of morale to cope with. His yacht British
Steel II won the first leg comfortably and was bookmaker's favourite to win
the whole race. Exactly halfway between Cape Horn and New Zealand, the
furthest point from land on the planet Earth, the boat lost its mast after
equipment failure.
'Once we realised that we had enough food and fuel to survive and that no
one had been injured when the mast fell down, everyone aboard had to come to
terms with being without a chance of winning the race. We weren't even sure
if we could reach Hobart in time to re-start on the next leg,' said Tudor, a
charismatic Welshman given to quoting from 'The Ancient Mariner.'
'We had one crewman sitting at the saloon table suddenly take his spectacles
off and beat them to fragments with his fists out of sheer frustration. It
was quite dreadful.' Tudor's influence in keeping the boat's spirit in good
enough shape to have them arrive in Tasmania raring to go on the next leg is
remarkable.
While other yachts have had personnel come and go, British Steel II has the
same squad it started with 16 months ago, without a change of watch or watch
leader.
'My experience of management is running my own business but here I know I'm
not trying to sell anyone anything. I'm purely a motivator. I also have to
be aware that with a high-powered workforce (and Tudor has several highly
successful self-made business tycoons aboard) there only one way to do a job
and that's the right way.'
Probably the 'skipper's skipper' most admired by his peers is the veteran
John Chittenden. Although the most experienced man of the sea, he has
rejected almost all of that ethos in favour of a shrewd, patient knowledge
of humanity. 'The running of a merchant ship has evolved over hundreds of
years into a pretty well bomb-proof routine. Here we're not into all that
shadow of the yardarm stuff,' he laughed. 'This has to be invented as we
go.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ON FOOT, by bicycle, motorcycle or boat, Cambodians go to the polls tomorrow
to elect a new government, in what will be the culmination of a troubled
Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.24bn) United Nations operation to bring peace and
democracy to a country that has known neither for more than two decades.
After years of dictatorship and communism, the 4.8m voters registered by the
UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) are unfamiliar with the way
democracy works and have only recently learnt from UN officials about the
secret ballot.
Khmer Rouge guerrillas have reneged on the 1991 peace agreement which
brought Untac to Cambodia and are still waging war against the government in
Phnom Penh. They have threatened to kill Cambodians who cast their votes,
while government soldiers have threatened to kill those who fail to vote for
the government.
Some voters will have to travel 20km to reach a polling station; others in
Khmer Rouge areas will not be able to vote at all.
When they reach the polling stations - reduced from 2,200 to 1,500 or less
because of the danger of Khmer Rouge attack - Cambodians will have their
index fingers dipped in invisible fluorescent ink. It can be detected under
ultra-violet light so nobody votes twice. Voting continues until next
Friday. If all goes well, Cambodians will elect a 120-member constituent
assembly. It will draft a new constitution within three months and become a
legislative assembly, which will form the new government. Once this stage is
reached Untac can supposedly leave the country.
The favourites in the election are the Cambodian People's party, which is
the communist party of the existing Phnom Penh administration, and
Funcinpec, the royalist party.
Veteran journalists of the Indochina wars have descended on gathered in
Phnom Penh to watch the event, recall old times and smoke marijuana, which
is available in local vegetable markets as a flavouring for soup.

GENERAL MOTORS is asking German authorities to pursue charges against Mr
Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, its former head of worldwide purchasing,
for the alleged removal of company documents.
Mr Lopez moved to Volkswagen of Germany in March as head of production and
purchasing.
At a press conference after GM's annual meeting in Oklahoma City yesterday,
Mr Louis Hughes, executive vice-president for international operations, said
the company had 'executed a legal complaint' against Mr Lopez 'for what we
believe is the taking of confidential documents'.
The complaint was in the hands of German prosecutors, who would decide
whether to pursue the charges, Mr Hughes added.
In Bonn last night, VW declined to comment. An official said there would be
no statement until Monday at the earliest.
Shortly after Mr Lopez's surprise departure, he hired six GM employees -
three purchasing executives and three buyers - who had worked under him. GM
has alleged that Mr Lopez also approached up to 40 more in an effort to lure
them to VW. The US group has already filed a legal action in Germany to stop
alleged headhunting of staff by Mr Lopez.
Mr Lopez's departure from GM was seen as a blow to its efforts to cut car
manufacturing costs in North America, where the company has lost Dollars
12bn (Pounds 7.70bn) over the past two years.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Lambeth criticised by auditor over Pounds 20m unlawful
spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Labour-controlled London Borough of Lambeth has incurred unlawful
expenditure of Pounds 20.2m in payments to one of its departments since
1988, according to a report published yesterday.
Mr Paul Claydon, the district auditor, said that when the council finally
allowed 'proper competition' for its highway contracts for the first time in
July 1992, the winning bids were 29 per cent cheaper than those tendered by
Lambeth's direct labour organisation.
The council could have saved Pounds 5m by contracting out the work properly
under the competitive tendering system during the period when the unlawful
payments were made, the auditor's public interest report said.
Mr Claydon is now considering whether to ask the High Court to order
individuals to repay the money unlawfully spent.
Examples of apparent 'deliberate manipulation' to the advantage of Lambeth's
own workforce before 1992 included the withdrawal of a successful private
contractor's tender in 1988 'after receiving threats', and the successful
reduction of a bid by the direct labour organisation in 1986 after a private
contractor had submitted a lower tender.
More than Pounds 200,000 was paid out to the highway maintenance workers
under a 'profit sharing' scheme without being authorised by councillors, the
report said.
Mr John Redwood, the local government minister, said the Department of the
Environment would take action if compulsory competitive tendering
requirements had been violated. This could involve closing Lambeth's
internal organisation by forbidding it to tender for contracts.
The DoE stressed that it would wait for Lambeth's detailed response before
taking action, but Mr Redwood said: 'There is always a danger with
authorities that don't treat financial control and discipline seriously that
things will go from bad to worse.'
The report also revealed that Pounds 173m was owed to Lambeth council in
overdue rents, community charge, rates and other debts. The council last
published its annual accounts on time eight years ago, while its financial
health is 'fragile' following 17 separate public interest reports from
district auditors in 14 years.
Mr Andrew Foster, chief executive of the Audit Commission, which employs the
district auditor, said the council had shown more vigour in the last year to
improve its position but voiced concern that 'a number of deadlines have
been missed'.
The council said it was implementing 120 recommendations by the auditor for
improved practice, and all allegations of malpractice would be referred to
an independent inquiry conducted by Ms Elizabeth Appleby, QC.

FT  22 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Gold
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is nothing like a little speculative fever to seduce the punters. Gold
touched Dollars 384 an ounce in New York this week before nerves and
profit-taking set in. Since bullion has rallied from Dollars 325 an ounce in
barely seven weeks some kind of setback was inevitable, but it seems
premature to conclude that all the excitement is over.
Certainly the price has been driven by futures and options trading. As Sir
James Goldsmith has unloaded stakes in Newmont Mining he has had plenty of
cash to plough back into options. Once the ball was rolling Sir James may
have been able to take profits and withdraw some money from the market. He
could then rely on options market makers rushing to cover their exposure,
gold producers keen to unwind forward sales and mechanical computer buying
programmes to keep things on the boil.
Such speculative bubbles tend to burst rather nastily. Yet at least part of
the recent rise may reflect the undervaluation of gold earlier in the year.
Consumption - most notably in the far east - was almost twice world mined
production last year. Only substantial sales from central banks kept the
price depressed. They have mostly stepped back from the market in the recent
rally, just as far eastern buyers have held back while the market is
volatile. But unless large official sales resume, gold will probably hold
above Dollars 350 an ounce.

FT  22 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: UK brewing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission's intervention in the brewing industry
may turn out not to have been quite so counter-productive after all. There
are a number of factors behind the outbreak of hostilities in brewing.
Recession and an ageing population have reduced demand for beer. Courage
appears to have lost its touch after the acquisition of Grand Metropolitan's
brands. But the most significant factor is a shift in the balance of power
towards the retail end of the beer industry. The obligation on brewers to
free pubs from the tie has facilitated the development of independent pub
chains with the clout to demand large discounts from their suppliers.
Consumers may not have felt much benefit yet, though they will surely demand
lower prices as time goes by. For now, the benefits accrue to companies such
as Boddington, which has left brewing already, First Leisure which was never
in it and JD Wetherspoon, one of the nimbler new multiples whose shares have
risen by 80 per cent since last October's flotation. The safe haven of pub
retailing also offers diversification into food which enhances gearing to
economic recovery.
As for the large brewers, the assumption is that the confrontation will
continue until one blinks and cuts capacity. But the problem is also one of
excessive proliferation of brands and cannot be dealt with simply by closing
down plant. That adds to the risks facing the big brewers. The real damage
will occur when discounting spreads to brands that at present command a
premium. Once that happens, lost ground may never be recovered.

FT  22 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Brixton Estate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's issue from Brixton Estate is a measure of how, after years of
horrendous underperformance, speculative froth is returning to the quoted
property market. Shares in the leading companies are above net asset values
with investors developing a voracious appetite for new paper. Before
yesterday's issue Brixton Estate's shares were trading at a premium of 7 per
cent to stated net assets. The deeply-discounted two-for-five rights issue
will dilute future net asset values, but the company was rewarded by a 6 per
cent rise in its share price. Such a response is only likely to stimulate a
string of similar fund-raising exercises. Shareholders should doubt the
wisdom of de-gearing at this stage of the cycle. But in Brixton's case its
well-regarded management intends to sink the full Pounds 101m proceeds into
property.
It is gambling that shareholders will be prepared to forgo some of the
potential increase in net asset value in return for better prospects for
income growth. With gearing of 114 per cent, the company had little
flexibility to borrow more itself. Brixton promises to gear up again from
its broader equity base if the opportunities emerge. If not, it will
certainly be hugely embarrassed.
The more money is sunk into property, the more certain the recovery in
values becomes. But if investors really do believe the market has turned,
there is now far better value in buying property direct.

FT  22 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Deflated expectations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cynics will have quickly rumbled yesterday's inflation data. Strip out the
poll tax and mortgage interest effect and the underlying rate of inflation
appears back on a gently rising trend. Insofar as this means companies have
some room for manoeuvre on pricing, this need not be bad for the equity
market. Especially so, since the fall in unit labour costs adds to the
striking competitive advantage UK companies enjoy compared with their German
counterparts. The low headline rate of inflation will also dampen wage
demands for some time.
Despite this week's blip in output figures, these factors should be
beneficial for earnings in the manufacturing sector. That may help explain
the 23 point rise in the FT-SE Mid 250 index this week while the large FT-SE
100 fell 35 points. But the market has also discounted earnings growth and
worries have emerged in other areas. Rights issues are flowing again, the
brewers are fighting for market share, brand values are under threat in the
food industry, and low wage increases will not do much to boost retail
spending.
To compensate for its lack of overall direction, the equity market is still
inclined to look for movement in individual sectors. Property shares are the
height of fashion. The enthusiasm has spread to banks who can expect falling
provisions if property values rise, and even to companies such as Forte and
Ladbroke which have considerable property interests. The market could have
sensed an accelerating recovery, but it has been running ahead of the
underlying market for much of this year. The latest excitement may be simply
a case of boredom causing it to suspend its disbelief.

FT  22 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Losses close a turbulent week
for Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A combination of profit-taking, expiration-related trading and sell programs
meant US share prices ended a tumultuous week with sharp losses, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 30.45 at 3,492.83.
The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 4.75 lower at 445.84, while
the Amex composite finished down 0.57 at 432.86, and the Nasdaq composite
down 3.14 at 694.29. Trading volume on the NYSE was 273m shares.
Following Wednesday and Thursday's record-breaking gains - the Dow climbed
79 points over the two days - some investors chose to book some of their
profits as soon as trading opened, contributing to an early 20-point decline
in the Dow. The fact that a large number of analysts remained suspicious of
the market's strength, believing that the buying was an over-reaction to the
absence of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve, only hastened the
rush to take some profits.
The monthly expiration of stock and stock index futures also sparked some
early selling. Although share prices quickly rallied from early technical
selling, stocks were hit later in the day by fresh declines in bond prices.
The benchmark 30-year government bond fell almost  1/2 point, sending the
yield back over 7 per cent. A number of afternoon sell programs, and news of
higher gold prices, subsequently pushed stocks to new lows late in the
session. AT&amp;T received an early lift from securities house Alex Brown, which
upgraded its rating on the stock and raised its earnings growth estimates.
The recommendation helped AT&amp;T gain Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 60 3/4 , but by
the close the shares had slipped back to end down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 59
1/8 . Trading volume was heavy at 3.3m shares.
Other leading stocks, under pressure from profit-taking, were also lower.
They included Coca-Cola, down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 40 7/8 , Pepsico,
down Dollars 1 at Dollars 36 3/4 , Walt Disney, Dollars  7/8 lower at
Dollars 43 1/8 , and Time Warner, down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 36 1/8 .
Storage Technology surged Dollars 1 to Dollars 40 5/8 in volume of 1m shares
after the company said it had agreed to acquire Amperif, a privately held
storage system manufacturer, for Dollars 83.6m.
The news that Storage Tech also plans to start shipping its long-delayed
Iceberg storage system by the fourth quarter of this year also buoyed the
stock.
May Department Stores rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 75 1/4 after the retailer
announced plans to invest Dollars 4.6bn over next five years on new stores.
The company also announced a 2-for-1 stock split.
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed little changed in extremely heavy trading. The
composite index rose 4.40 points, or 0.11 per cent, to 3835.99, with
advances leading declines 378 to 294. On the week, the index was up about 22
points. Volume, the third highest on record, was increased by extremely
heavy trading in Encor Inc. (about 14.1m shares) and American Eagle
Petroleums (about 12.8m shares), which are involved in separate merger
transactions. Volume reached 87,446,000 shares, above yesterday's 83,375,000
shares, and trading value was CDollars 625.6m against CDollars 541.7m.

leave Nikkei 1.1% ahead

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDEX-linked purchases by investment trust companies triggered a
short-covering rally in the stock index futures markets, lifting the Nikkei
average by 1.1 per cent in late activity, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average ended 227.08 higher at 20,557.47, and up 0.1 per cent
on the week, after trading between 20,297.76 and 20,653.85. The Topix Index
of all first section issues ended 18.79 higher at 1,613.12 and, in London,
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.69 to 1,244.25.
Volume was 400m shares, compared with Thursday's 349m. Advances led declines
by 765 to 250 with 162 unchanged.
Brokers said that comments from Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan
governor, that the nation's economy should recover in the second half of
this financial year encouraged some buying. Investors, equally, continued to
select issues with favourable earnings, or at the lower end of their trading
range.
An analyst at a big four Japanese broker said that he expects major
institutional investors to shift funds into equities after the earnings
season ends in about two weeks. Until then, however, trading volume on the
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange should remain light.
Buying from investment trusts boosted issues in the shipbuilding sector.
Hitachi Zosen, the day's most active issue, gained Y26 to Y603, Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries Y28 to Y734 and Sasebo Heavy Industries Y13 to Y607.
Consumer electronic issues saw buying. Pioneer Electronic rose Y130 to
Y2,520, TDK by Y50 to Y3,990 and Sony by Y50 to Y4,730.
But Nihon Unisys, the importer and computer marketer, dropped Y40 at Y1,420
on reports that the nation's securities watchdog had asked prosecutors to
indict two people for allegedly manipulating the company's stock.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 213.24 higher at 22,722.58, in volume of
24.5m shares.
Roundup
With a few exceptions, Pacific Rim markets tended to move on to the
downgrade.
AUSTRALIA finished the week on a strong note, supported by a strong banking
sector, Wall Street's advance and a recovery in the three month futures
contract.
The All Ordinaries index closed up 11.4 points at 1,695.6, little changed on
the week, in turnover of ADollars 342.36m.
The banking sector index gained 49.9 or 2.2 per cent to 2,335.8. National
Australia Bank soared 27 cents to a record ADollars 9.73 in response to
interim net profits which rose to ADollars 507.3m. Westpac, which reported a
ADollars 204.6m net loss, jumped near the close to finish 9 cents ahead at
ADollars 3.70.
On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the June Share Price Index contract rose 30
to a high of 1,703 before edging back to close at 1,694, with 1,539
contracts traded.
SEOUL gained for the fifth consecutive session but ended only fractionally
firmer as selling of large-capitalisation shares offset most of the solid
gains posted by small and medium-sized companies.
The composite index added 0.62 to 727.99, 3.1 per cent higher on the week.
TAIWAN was lower in thin trade which left the weighted index down 46.38 or
1.1 per cent at 4,300.25, for a weekly fall of 5.8 per cent. Turnover
totalled TDollars 23.2bn after Thursday's TDollars 25.1bn.
Investors were discouraged by conflict within the ruling Nationalist Party
ahead of its congress in August, poor April export order figures, and fears
that the government would revise down its 6.6 per cent GNP growth forecast
for this year. Financial shares again led the day's falls, with Cathay Life
Insurance sinking TDollars 4 to TDollars 170.
NEW ZEALAND drifted to a lower close, due mostly to minor falls in the
leading stocks, in quiet trade. The NZSE-40 capital index dipped 8.85 to
1,618.60, 2.4 per cent up on the week. Telecom shed 2 cents to Dollars 3.00
after its record high on Thursday.
SINGAPORE saw a third straight day of profit-taking which left the Straits
Times Industrial index 14.54 lower at 1,861.86, little changed on the week,
with activity dominated by speculative Malaysian stocks traded over the
counter.
BANGKOK lost ground as disappointment over worse-than-expected earnings this
week soured the mood. The SET index shed 7.24 to 858.37, 2.6 per cent lower
on the week, in moderate volume.
BOMBAY moved up after a two-day closure for settlement work, the BSE index
closing 47.74 higher at 2,357.71. Brokers said that the market had
stabilised, and there were rumours that the BSE might even lift restrictions
on short sales.

FT  22 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Advisers in quandary over Hong Kong
boom - Overseas investors are ignoring recent hints that it is time to get
out of the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When new issues are hundreds of times over-subscribed, second line stocks
double over-night, and the stock market shrugs off negative news with
historic highs, it is generally-assumed to be time to get out of the Hong
Kong stock market.
Certainly, there are enormous profits to be taken. The Hang Seng index has
celebrated a major bull run since the start of 1991 and in spite of the
political uncertainties of the moment, it has still achieved a 30 per cent
rise this year, closing yesterday at a record high of 7,169.96.
The stock market has focused on seemingly-improved Sino-British relations,
and has chosen to ignore crucial issues such as the debate over the renewal
of China's Most Favoured Nation status, and the over-heating of the Chinese
economy.
However, the move has not been entirely irrational. For the past three
years, Hong Kong has been gradually eroding its substantial political risk
discount, as investors have realised that the 1997 hand-over to China offers
huge economic benefits, in addition to its political challenges.
The economic boom in Southern China, the fastest growing region in the world
during the past decade, has been the engine for corporate earnings growth
(in earnings per share terms) of 21 per cent in 1991, 22 per cent in 1992
and an anticipated 20 per cent in 1993.
This growth is eroded by the high inflation rate, which remains alarmingly
close to double digits, but the corporate earnings trend remains impressive.
There have been other fringe benefits from China, with mainland money
pushing up the property and stock markets, as a means of switching out of
the rapidly devaluing Renminbi.
The story of Hong Kong as gateway to the Chinese economic miracle has caught
the imagination of US fund managers, with a stream of fresh capital flooding
in.
To US institutions, Hong Kong offers the twin advantages of its currency peg
to the strengthening US dollar, and its strong regulatory framework (at
least by Asian standards). In addition, when Hong Kong experiences an
economic slowdown, as in 1989, it has tended to achieve growth figures that
outpace the economic booms of the major economies.
But there are a number of reasons for caution. One of the keys to Hong
Kong's boom has been local liquidity. Hong Kong has experienced sizeably
negative interest rates for two years, leaving locals with the option of
shoring up savings in either the stock market or property market. As a
result of the currency's US dollar link, interest rates are expected to push
upwards soon.
The annual US debate on China's MFN will also cause some unease, as the
impact on Hong Kong would be devastating, if China lost this status. Next
year's renewal may hang on some conditions, but while there is little
indication that it is seriously at risk, the uncertainties of the debate
could have some impact on current enthusiasm for stocks.
Finally, and most important, there is the issue of China's economy. Last
week's announcement of a 25 per cent increase in China's retail sales for
April is the latest in a line of statistics which demonstrate unequivocally
the overheating of the Chinese economy.
The last time this happened, austerity measures led to a 60 per cent drop in
Hong Kong's GDP growth, back in 1989. This time round the impact would be
less severe, as the economy in the neighbouring Chinese province of
Guangdong has reached a greater level of autonomy, but with a substantial
devaluation of the RMB expected and a credit crunch already being imposed,
Hong Kong will be affected.
Mr Sheldon Kasowitz, research analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities, says:
'Huge increases in interest rates, the collapse of the currency and a
deteriorating trade balance are not the things that bull markets are made
of'.
However, the index is not overvalued on a current year basis. Based on
Jardine Fleming's forecasts, the Hong Kong market is trading on a
price-earnings ratio of only 12.4 times 1993 earnings. By comparison,
Thailand is on 13.2 and Malaysia 21.
This represents the top-end of Hong Kong's historical trading range, but
that could be said to reflect the rapidly-changing attitude towards Hong
Kong's future relationship with China.
Of greater concern is the fact that share prices have been rising on the
basis of political interpretation, rather than on political fact.
It is widely assumed that there has been a dramatic narrowing of the
political impasse over Governor Patten's controversial political proposals,
yet the meetings between Britain and China have not yet succeeded in moving
beyond principals.
Furthermore, it can be argued that China has a certain amount of
self-interest in appearing more conciliatory, during the course of the
debate over its MFN status. China has already demonstrated its ability to
influence the stock market when it wants to make a political point.
Against this, there is the enthusiasm of overseas investors. Mr Richard
Witts, managing director of United Mok Ying Kie Securities, says: 'It is
going to take a lot to stop money flooding in from the US and Europe. These
investors are going to be prepared to suffer a little for the long-term
attractions'.
Brokers' targets of a year-end Hang Seng index of between 7,500 and 8,000
still do not seem far-fetched, on current earnings forecasts. But given the
numerous uncertainties facing Hong Kong, it is hard to imagine there will
not be any blood and tears before it gets there.

FT  22 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses remain wary about Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES were chary about responding to consecutive record highs on Wall
Street, writes Our Markets Staff, as Paris and Brussels extended their
Ascension day holidays.
FRANKFURT was lifted by options-related buying in the last 10 minutes of
trading, but the DAX still closed 6.82 lower at 1,610.59, down 1.5 per cent
on the week, in volume up from DM5.1bn to DM5.4bn.
Schering rose DM14 to DM780.50. Mr Reinhard Fischer of Paribas Capital
Markets, which has brought Germany up from slightly underweight to average
as the dollar has strengthened, said that the pharmaceuticals group had
moved on its 80 per cent export ratio, and the potential effect of
dollar/mark relationship on its export margins.
ZURICH finished at a fourth consecutive record high although profit-taking
erased most of the early gains and Wall Street's weaker opening dampened the
mood. The SMI index finished 6.5 higher at 2,233.1, after a day's peak of
2,245.3. The market rose 2.1 per cent over the week.
Nestle and Brown Boveri were lifted by the strong dollar, rising SFr10 to
SFr1,140 in the bearers, and SFr10 to SFr813 respectively.
MILAN edged lower as the market digested yesterday's supplementary budget
package. Thursday's late and cautious half percentage point discount rate
cut had been widely expected and investors focused on the prospects for
further cuts. The Comit index eased 0.72 to 558.45 for a 3.6 per cent rise
on the week.
Recent out-performers bore the brunt of profit-taking. Against the trend,
Italmobiliare found favour with domestic fund managers, adding L1,500 or 3.5
per cent to fix at L44,500 before easing to L44,400 after hours.
MADRID closed virtually in balance, with banks higher and utilities mostly
lower after Fecsa blamed low demand, low rainfall and the peseta devaluation
for its decision not to pay a final dividend.
Fecsa fell Pta44 to Pta685 as the general index closed 0.92 higher at
256.33, up 1 per cent on the week.
AMSTERDAM saw early gains eroded after news of Wall Street's weak opening in
modest trade with many investors extending the Ascension Day holiday into
the weekend. The CBS Tendency index added 0.30 to 104.50, a weekly decline
of 2.8 per cent. Heineken, under pressure in recent weeks, shed another 90
cents to Fl 177.90 on news of higher first quarter losses at its Spanish El
Aguila affiliate.
STOCKHOLM advanced in heavy trading, mainly on foreign buying of the
pharmaceutical group, Astra, and the telecommunications giant, Ericsson. The
Affarsvarlden General index rose 16.2 to 1,092.7, up 1 per cent on the week.
Astra A rose SKr21 to SKr751 and Ericsson B by SKr9 to SKr320 as turnover
rose from SKr966m to SKr1.12bn.
HELSINKI climbed further after Wednesday's news that a threatened labour
market conflict had been settled, the Hex index rising 31.06, or 2.5 per
cent to 1,248.24, up 7.2 per cent on the week. Dealers said that hopes of
lower interest rates and the affirmative Danish vote on Maastricht had also
created optimism.
COPENHAGEN ended a politically crucial week with the Maastricht result that
it expected and and the CSE index 0.23 lower at 303.66, stood 0.5 per cent
down from its May 14 peak.

FT  22 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rights issue worries restrain
equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TURBULENT week in the London equity market drew to a close with prices of
the leading blue chips moderately easier as dealers continued to fret about
cash demands on the market and ignoring more good news on the domestic
economic front.
Continuing the trend of recent weeks, however, the second-line stocks
attracted renewed buying interest from the big institutions.
The FT-SE 100 index ended the day a net 4.6 lower at 2,812.2, down 34.8, or
1.2 per cent, on the week. Over the two-week account, however, the index has
risen 18.5, or 0.6 per cent. The FT-SE Mid 250 index extended its strong
showing, moving up 5.0 to a record 3,165.1; on the week the 250 index rose
22.8, or 0.7 per cent. Over the account the 250 index showed a gain of
55.76, or 1.8 per cent.
Gilt-eged stocks rose strongly in mid-session, helped by the upward move by
sterling after the economic data, but lost ground towards the close of
business as the pound eased against the dollar, although maintaining its
strength against the D-mark.
Longer-dated gilts, up around  1/4 at the day's best, eventually closed
around  3/16 down on balance. Index-linked, meanwhile retained gains of
around  1/4 , having been up  3/8 earlier in the session.
The FT-SE 100 began the day in good form, opening around six points higher
in response to Wall Street moving up to an all-time high overnight. The
market's optimism was quickly dented, however, by the latest fund raising
moves in London. Brixton Estates joined a long list of companies seeking
additional capital asking shareholders for Pounds 100m, albeit at favourable
terms. This week's heaviest calls have come from British Airways, which is
raising Pounds 442m and Allied Lyons, asking for Pounds 200m via a
convertible rights. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi launched a Pounds 73m cash call while
Compass proposed an Pounds 86m call. The market was awash yesterday with
suggestions that the new trading account could well see another wave of
funding calls with the property sector said to be a prime area.
The cash market was firmly in negative territory within an hour of the
opening and dropped to the day's low, down 15.7 FT-SE points, as Wall Street
opened with a fall of around 15 points on the Dow Jones Average. A gradual
recovery in the US steadied London towards the close. Turnover was a healthy
699.2m shares.

<TEXT>
Condom manufacturer and photo processor London International saw its shares
fall 7 to 178p on news that Superdrug the high street retailer had slashed
the price of condoms by a third. The news led to fears of a price war in the
same mould as recent battles over perfume and suncare products. One analyst
pointed out that prices cuts were most likely to be suffered by the retailer
rather than the manufacturer.
Nevertheless, the concerns gave an opportunity for dealers to mark down the
price of what has become an unloved stock following a poor performance by
its photo processing arm and a recent censure by the stock exchange over the
selective dispensing of information. Also dragged into the mire was Boots,
which fell 11 to 435p, with Morgan Stanley said to have also downgraded its
profit forecast.
Lubricants and chemicals company Burmah Castrol fell sharply as financial
advisers drew parallels with Brent Chemicals, which issued a profits warning
on Thursday.
Both companies have significant exposure to Germany - Burmah generates a
fifth of its turnover there - and there was additional pressure from a weak
D-Mark.
Burmah's shares were off 22 at one stage but securities house SGST argued
that the company was 'one of the few reliable success stories around', and
advised clients to see the price weakness as a buying opportunity. The
shares recovered to close 15 lower at 688p.
Brent bounced 3 to 102p but other chemicals groups were dragged down by the
worries it expressed. Courtaulds fell 10 to 517p and Laporte lost 6 to 607p.
Kleinwort Benson was one broker said to be recommending the regional
electricity stocks, strong in recent sessions on dividend hunting ahead of
the results season. East Midlands, which announced a restructuring
yesterday, added 8 1/2 to 457p and Norweb 12 to 503p.
British Gas fell 8 1/2 to 285 1/2 p on renewed concern over an on-going
Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry, due to report at the end of July,
and negative press coverage of the company's earnings prospects.
Profit-taking in Next, following the group's agm, sent the shares down 6 1/2
to 164 1/2 p. retail sales were in line with forecasts but hopes had been
raised after bullish noises from other retailers - with a consequent rise in
the shares.
An agency cross in Morrison Supermarkets of 4.8m, left the shares a penny
adrift at 161p.
Shares in Bass, which have fallen 15 per cent in three days following poor
results, tested the 450p level before finding support. They closed 2 ahead
at 464p.
P&amp;O, with substantial property interests, was one of the main beneficiaries
of the re-appraisal of property stocks. Strong demand from Salomons saw the
shares jump sharply but they came back on subsequent profit-taking to close
11 better at 603p. Ladbroke Group, also exposed to property, gained 3 to
179p.
Recovery buying boosted British Airways and the shares put on 9 to 310p.
Volume was 4.3m at the close. Volume in Vickers jumped to 4.7m after an
agency cross of 2.2m shares. The stock hardened a penny to 142p. Strong
two-way business in British Steel saw the shares firm 1 1/4 to 99 1/2 p.
Securiguard, the subject of a bid from Rentokil Group, added 2 to 292p, on
speculation that its predator would be forced to make a higher offer to win
control. Talk of an alternative offer was also heard. Rentokil eased 3 to
185p.

FT  22 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Banks marked down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A welter of 'also-ran' recommendations in the banking sector was countered
by the realisation that the sector index had closed above the FT-All share
for the first time in 16 years.
Rather than celebrate, marketmakers on the banking pitches took the moment
as a perfect opportunity to take profits and most of the banks closed down
on the day.
The morning rise was partly prompted by BZW which issued a buy note saying
banks had benefited from recession by being able to justify greater charges
and cutting costs. Also, Mr John Aitken at UBS recommended NatWest and
Lloyds after raising 1993 forecasts.
NatWest was marked up 14 in early trading but sold down throughout the day
to close 2 lower at 473p. Lloyds was 11 higher but closed a net 7 off at
541p and Barclays turned around from a high of 470p to end the day 3 lighter
at 457p.
The day's exceptions were Bank of Scotland and Royal Bank of Scotland which
rose 5 to 146p and 4 to 282p respectively. They benefited from a sharp rise
in results announced by National Australia Bank.

FT  22 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Property cash calls rumoured
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SPATE of rights issues in the property sector was being predicted
following Brixton Estates successful Pounds 100.7m cash call yesterday.
Analysts said the renewed appetite for the sector was likely to encourage
other property groups to come to the market. Hammerson in particular, and
MEPC, were widely tipped to follow suit within the next two weeks. They
would be likely to seek combined funds in the region of Pounds 500m, and
smaller property companies are also likely to join the fray.
Rights issues are seen as important for those companies needing to buy good
quality properties to ensure healthy cash flow. Meanwhile, with property
shares again racing forward yesterday, some property specialists underlined
their caution over embracing the whole sector. Mr Marc Gilbard at NatWest
Securities said: 'We prefer to be more selective. While institutional
appetite is high at the moment and supporting both issues and share rises,
when it runs out the quality differentiation will return.'
A more bullish Mr Andrew Causer at James Capel said: 'The sector has gone
ballistic. Investors should be buying across the board for a significant
recovery in the direct market in 1994 and 1995.'
Among the leaders, Land Securities jumped 9 to 574p, British Land 12 to 314p
and MEPC 7 to 437p. Brixton's rise of 11 to 207p seemed to support criticism
from some analysts that the rights issue discount was too large. The cash
call talk around Hammerson pulled the 'A' shares back to close 2 down at
337p.

FT  22 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading

<TEXT>
WORRIES that the London market might have to soak up a spate of rights
issues and fears of a turnaround on Wall Street led to a slide in stock
index futures yesterday, writes Joel Kibazo.
In a volatile session, the June contract on the FT-SE started trading at
2,828. A sizeable sell order brought a decline but June was later boosted by
the late morning release of favourable inflation figures. It was then that
June hit the day's high of 2,832.
However, talk of a flood of rights issues particularly in the property
sector, and fears that the New York market would start to tumble following
its recent strength once again encouraged strong selling and the contract
fell to the day's low of 2,803 in the last half hour of trading.
June finished at 2,812, more or less in line with the cash market on volume
of around 11,000 contracts.
The main feature in the traded options was the expiry of the May Index
options at 10.30 am. Total volume was 35,517 lots with Land Securities the
most active issue.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Money Markets: Sterling contracts up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THERE was a fractionally more bullish tone about UK base rate cuts yesterday
after Britain's inflation figures came in slightly better than had been
expected, writes James Blitz. The retail prices index showed a 1.3 per cent
rise in inflation in the year to April after a year-on-year increase of 1.9
per cent in March. This meant that there was an overall fall of 0.6
percentage points in the inflation rate.
The move from the poll tax to the council tax had a big impact in forcing
down the inflation rate.
Dealers in interest rate futures markets took the view that the lower
inflation rate would make a cut in UK base rates possible if the authorities
decided to introduce one later this year.
However, the June contract rose only 3 basis points closing at 93.95, a
level that was more or less consonant with 3-month sterling cash.
The September contract rose 10 basis points at one stage, to a high of
94.06, later falling back to close at 94.02. Trading in the September
contract was a great deal heavier than for June, indicating that the market
believes a cut is more likely to happen in the autumn, if at all.
Rates in the sterling cash market softened slightly during the day.
Three-month interest rates closed at 6 per cent, having been at 6 1/16 per
cent earlier in the day. There was a daily shortage of Pounds 1.5bn in the
discount market, with only Pounds 125m left as late assistance. The
overnight rate fell as low as 4 per cent.
In Europe, Finland and Portugal joined in the general round of official
interest rate cutting that has dominated the week of the Danish referendum.
Finland reduced its tender rate from 8.59 per cent to 8.37 per cent.
Portugal reduced its discount rate by 100 basis points to 13 1/2 per cent
and its reference rate by 150 basis points to 14 1/2 per cent.
German futures contracts fell back yesterday as dealers took the view that
the D-Mark's weakness on the currency markets might threaten the established
pace of German monetary easing.
The September Euromark contract fell 7 basis points to close at 93.46. Call
money also remained firm near Wednesday's level of 7.85 per cent with the
drain on liquidity caused by this month's tax payments prompting the central
bank to provide the market with short term funds.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling and yen surge ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK continued to show signs of weakness against most currencies
yesterday, allowing sterling to break through the DM2.52 barrier at one
point, and falling to new lows against the Japanese yen, writes James Blitz.
Yesterday's trading brought little in the way of fresh news to the market.
However, the D-Mark continued to trend downwards at the end of a week which
has brought Denmark's ratification of the Maastricht treaty and new
confidence in European Monetary Union. Inside the European exchange rate
mechanism, the French franc again broke below the FFr3.37 level against the
German currency and closed at FFr3.365, despite the fact that most of the
French market remained on holiday.
The Dutch guilder also broke through to a new 5-year high against the German
currency, moving from NFl 1.1230 to a London close of NFl 1.120.
By the close of trading, the guilder was some 59 basis points higher than
the D-Mark in the ERM grid.
Another indication of the D-Mark's softness was the fall in its ERM
divergence indicator from minus 17 percentage points to minus 23 percentage
points. It was 38 basis points above the weakest currency, the French franc.
However, the D-Mark could recover next week if provisional data for consumer
price inflation in Germany indicate lower annual inflation.
The dollar benefited from the D-Mark's general softness to close 1.4
pfennigs up on the day at DM1.6275. But sterling and the yen moved higher
against the D-Mark as a result of special factors.
Sterling broke through the DM2.52 level, peaking at DM2.5215 following
retail price inflation figures that were a little better than the market had
expected. However, it later succumbed to profit-taking to close at DM
2.5075, down  1/4 pfennig on the day.
A good inflation figure would normally raise speculation of another base
rate cut, weakening the currency. But Mr Mark Austin, an economist at
Midland Global Markets in London, said the figure underlined that the
government's inflation target was intact - and that this compounded the
general confidence in the UK authorities following the Maastricht
ratification vote in the House of Commons.
The Japanese currency also moved strongly against the D-Mark, closing at
Y67.90. from a previous Y68.53. The yen is likely to remain on the firm side
in the run-up to next week's trade talks between the US and Japanese
government. In the wake of this week's very poor US trade figures, there are
expectations that the US authorities will again push Tokyo into a strong yen
policy.

NINTENDO, the Japanese company that leads the video games market, yesterday
reported a 5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Y163.8bn (Dollars
1.48bn) for the year to end-March, as sales of its games continued to rise
strongly.
Nintendo said demand for its most advanced games machine, the Super Nintendo
Entertainment System, grew strongly to support an 11 per cent rise in sales
to Y562.75bn from Y507.50bn the year before.
Net income rose 2 per cent to Y87.16bn and the directors are proposing to
increase the net dividend by Y10 to a total of Y70 per share for the year.
Although Nintendo managed to stage a buoyant performance, it was not immune
from the effects of the worldwide economic slump and the impact of the sharp
appreciation of the yen.
The rise in earnings was however much lower than in the previous year when
pre-tax profits rose 11 per cent and net profits by 21 per cent.
Nintendo, which has an export ratio of more than 60 per cent, expects to
face a difficult trading environment in the year ahead, with the yen
forecast to continue its rise and the Japanese and European economies
unlikely to recover significantly in the near term.
The company faces growing competition in the games market not only from
Sega, which has been building up its share of overseas markets, but also
from new entrants into the market such as consumer electronics
manufacturers.
Kyocera, the leading Japanese manufacturer of semiconductors, reported a 7.5
per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y38bn for the year to March due to weak
domestic demand, foreign exchange-rate considerations and lower interest
rates, writes Wayne Aponte.
Net profits slipped by 13.9 per cent to Y20bn while sales dropped 5.2 per
cent to Y300bn.

<TEXT>
CANADIAN Airlines International has suffered two potentially serious
setbacks in its struggle to remain in the air as Canada's second leading
airline.
Tokyo Leasing, a creditor of the airline, said yesterday that it would not
support financial restructuring proposals in their present form, and
declared Canadian in default on a Y10bn (Dollars 90m) loan.
In addition, a Canadian newspaper reported yesterday that the National
Transportation Agency will urge the government to reject a proposed alliance
between Canadian and American Airlines of Dallas. The NTA's findings are due
to be made public next week.
The link between Canadian and American, which includes a CDollars 246m
(Dollars 195.20m) equity injection by the US carrier, is crucial to
Canadian's survival. Canadian has warned that it will collapse if the deal
does not go through.
The NTA was reported to be unhappy with provisions of the deal which would
give American Airlines control over some aspects of Canadian's business,
including major capital expenditures. Under Canadian law, foreign
shareholders are limited to a 25 per cent stake in a Canadian airline.
Canadian Airlines yesterday dismissed Tokyo Leasing's action as a
negotiating ploy. It said that several other creditors have also filed
default notices, and that negotiations with the leasing group are
continuing.

RICOH, a leading Japanese office automation equipment maker, yesterday
announced a 52.2 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y11.6bn (Dollars 9m)
for the year ended in March, and attributed the increase to its recent
restructuring efforts.
Net profits rose by 1.8 per cent to Y4.9bn for the year, in spite of a
decline in sales of 3.1 per cent to Y651.8bn. The Tokyo-based company had
streamlined its product range and research capacity, and strengthened sales
to offset the country's economic slump.
Brokers said the company's stock has risen in tandem with the overall
advance of the Nikkei average since mid-March.

FT  22 MAY 93 / International Company News: Directors reject Icahn's bid for
E-II Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR CARL ICAHN has been rejected in his multi-billion dollar bid for E-II
Holdings, the bankrupt parent company of Samsonite luggage, Culligan water
softener and McGregor clothing.
The creditors committee of E-II advised the directors to turn down the
Dollars 1.8bn all-cash offer made last week. E-II has its own reorganisation
plan that will be put before a bankruptcy court on Monday.
The directors agreed with the rejection, saying that the reorganisation plan
was 'in the best interests of all of E-II's constituencies, including its
subsidiaries and employees,' because it allowed creditors to share in any
appreciation in the value of the company.
The creditors committee indicated in its response to the bid that it 'was
sceptical that a sale of E-II's assets at this time would maximise value'.
But, a company statement added, the committee noted it would recommend that
the new board, which will take office after consummation of the
reorganisation plan, 'give con-sideration to' Mr Icahn's proposal.
E-II said yesterday that it was filing in court modifications to its
reorganisation plan which would reflect a higher liquidation value and would
provide 'a recovery to creditors in excess of the recovery which would have
been received by them under a proposal made by Carl Icahn, had that proposal
been capable of being implemented'.
The company said that, from studying the offer, 'it became obvious that
there were no firm financing arrangements supporting the Icahn proposal, and
that the Icahn proposal did not take into consideration a number of critical
legal and financial requirements for confirmation or the significance to the
company of the settlements reached with certain creditors'.
Mr Icahn, who owns almost 32 per cent of the group's junior bonds, reacted
by saying that E-II 'has finally admitted what we charged all along - that
the values used in formulating the plan were materially understated to the
dis-advantage of the junior creditors'.
Earlier, he said after his offer was rejected that he would be at Monday's
court hearing 'with the cash'.

<TEXT>
TRADING in the shares of Ciga, the Italian luxury hotels chain controlled by
the Aga Khan, was suspended yesterday in a further twist to the group's
long-running battle to remain afloat.
The suspension, which included Fimpar, the Aga Khan's holding company which
controls Ciga, resulted from a formal request by the subsidiary of an
Italian bank following the expiry of Dollars 100m revolving credit to
Fimpar.
Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the public sector investment banking and credit
institution has taken legal action to freeze Fimpar's assets - triggering
the share suspensions by Italy's Consob companies and stockmarket watchdog.
IMI's move followed the expiry earlier this month of the Dollars 100m
three-year facility and failure so far to reach agreement on an extension.
'Fimpar was not aware of the initiative,' said Mr Claudio Miorelli, a Ciga
official. 'We are now defining the terms of extending the facility,' he
said. He played down the assets freeze as a 'formal procedural step' taken
by IMI as lead manager of the syndicated credit facility.

first-quarter earnings

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOLLINGER, the holding company for Mr Conrad Black's international
publishing group, has reported flat first-quarter earnings.
An improved performance by the 68 per cent-owned Telegraph group in the UK
was not reflected on Hollinger's bottom line as a result of the weakening of
the pound against the Canadian dollar and the reduction of Hollinger's stake
at the time of the Telegraph's listing last July.
Hollinger's net income from continuing operations was CDollars 6.8m
(USDollars 5.4m), or 8 cents a share, up from CDollars 6.6m, or 7 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenues dropped slightly to CDollars 205.7m from
CDollars 209m.
These figures exclude an unusual gain of CDollars 18.5m this year and a
charge of CDollars 38.4m in 1992.
Excluding these charges as well as discontinued operations and the cost of
Hollinger's recent purchase of a stake in Canada's Southam Newspapers,
first-quarter earnings were CDollars 13.7m, or 20 cents a share, compared
with losses of CDollars 31.7m, or 63 cents a share, a year earlier.

FT  22 MAY 93 / International Company News: Newmont shares prompt new gold
rush - The Denver-based group's glittering attraction for investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gordon Parker, long-time chairman of Denver-based gold producer Newmont
Mining, is remarkably composed for a man who has just received a large and
largely faceless group of new bosses.
'I've been institutionalised,' he jokes, referring to the portfolio and
money managers who have bought nearly 30 per cent of Newmont's shares in the
last six months.
Many of these investors rushed in following Mr George Soros' widely
publicised purchase of a 14 per cent stake in Newmont on April 24. A
spokesman for Mr Soros, who has some Dollars 7bn under global management,
says the investment is passive and Mr Soros will not seek a seat on the
board.
Since the Soros trade gold prices have hit their highest level since 1991
and Newmont stock is at the top of its 52-week range.
Newmont's business is, literally, pure gold. Through its 90.1 per cent
ownership of Newmont Gold it is the largest gold producer in North America.
And the glitter of Newmont Gold's 19.5m ounces of gold reserves, most of
them in the rich Carlin Trend area of Nevada, has proved irresistible to a
generation of billionaire financiers.
Mr Parker, a South African mining executive who joined Newmont in 1981, has
repelled Mr T. Boone Pickens, the US corporate raider who wanted to grab
Newmont's gold mines in exchange for junk bonds in 1987. That forced Mr
Parker into the arms of Consolidated Gold Fields to recover some of the
Dollars 1.9bn debt incurred in the Pickens battle, and he later ended up
with Lord Hanson as boss when Gold Fields was taken over by the Hanson
conglomerate in 1989.
Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French industrialist, who is perhaps the
world's most prominent gold bull, became Newmont's main shareholder in 1990.
Sir James came on board when Lord Hanson swapped Gold Field's 49 per cent
stake in Newmont for about Dollars 1.6bn in US Pacific north-west forestry
operations owned by Sir James and his partner Lord Rothschild.
His purchase coincided with a long-term sag in gold prices. Even the biggest
gold bugs grew tired of waiting for inflation and global calamity to bolster
prices. Enormous central bank gold sales, 600 tonnes net last year, stifled
potential for a rally driven by the growing gap between gold demand and new
production.
As gold prices headed for seven-year lows, Sir James and Lord Rothschild -
through General Oriental Investments and RIT Capital Partners, their
respective investment vehicles - began to wriggle out of their Newmont
shares.
Newmont is a very efficiently run gold company, but investors buy gold
company shares for exposure to the gold market, and the metal's performance
has been dismal for the past decade. The long-term slide in gold prices has
been much more bothersome to Newmont than the continual change of big
shareholders.
As prices fall, all of the definitions of a gold mining company have to be
re-examined. Reserves must be revalued and revenues slip, even if, as is the
case with Newmont, production is rising. Newmont's income from continuing
operations dropped to Dollars 90.6m, or Dollars 1.30 a share, in 1992, from
Dollars 168.5m, or Dollars 2.49 a share, in 1990.
The fall was largely due to the sagging gold price. Mr Parker, despite his
reputation as a conservative executive, is wildly speculative when it comes
to pricing, and rarely hedges his production. Exposed to the market, Newmont
Gold's average sales price dropped from Dollars 403 per ounce in 1990 to
Dollars 379 in 1992.
Newmont Gold's production costs, at Dollars 210 per ounce, are among the
lowest in the world, but margins have been squeezed. The company produced
1.59m ounces of gold in 1992, and plans 1.7m ounces of output this year.
Newmont's 40 per cent income drop hampered Sir James' plans to reduce his
holdings, which comprised an uncomfortably large portion of his portfolio.
General Oriental Investments and the RIT group managed to sell 1.8m Newmont
shares to an Australian investor in October who immediately sold them on
through Salomon Brothers to about 50 institutional investors. The deal
received little notice, and gold prices continued their slide.
The machinations of the gold market are as opaque and malleable as the metal
itself, and in a remarkable turnround, spot prices for an ounce of gold in
New York rebounded from a January low of Dollars 328 to Dollars 347.50 on
the April day that Mr Soros bought 10m Newmont shares from the Goldsmith
group for Dollars 39.50 each.
Sir James, for his part, fanned the rally by telling the Press he had used
the Newmont proceeds to buy call options on gold. His options position
demonstrated he wanted to remain invested in gold, and its execution sent
the traders who granted the options into the market to buy gold to back the
trades. The deal worked neatly for Newmont, and for Sir James, who still
held some 30 per cent of the company and sits on its board.
Three days after the widely-publicised Soros deal, Newmont unloaded its 14
per cent interest in an Australian gold producer, Newcrest, netting about
Dollars 67m.
As the present gold fever which he helped to start worked its way through
world markets, Sir James sold another 10 per cent stake, or 6.5m Newmont
shares, to a consortium of investment banks that quickly remarketed the
block in a public offering at Dollars 45.50 per share. In another public
relations coup, the May 11 offering coincided with the release of the
widely-followed annual survey of the gold market by Gold Fields Minerals
Services, which is partly owned by Newmont.
The data showed gold demand far outstripping production last year and
pointed to China as an important gold buyer.
The excitement over gold may also help Newmont raise Dollars 115m to finance
a 15-year gold-leaching venture in Uzbekistan. It expects the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development to put up Dollars 90m of the project
finance, but is also courting other investors to help finance the deal.
Beyond the vagaries of the gold market, Newmont is well positioned for
growth. It plans to spend Dollars 68m this year to find and develop gold
reserves, more than half of this outside the US.
Its core operation, Newmont Gold, is mining lower-grade ore as it goes
deeper into the Carlin Trend. The company is buying a Dollars 230m roaster
to process some of this ore and is developing other extraction technologies.
Newmont Mining, meanwhile, is exploring properties in Nevada, near its
existing operations, and in Oregon and Idaho. In August, production will
begin at the company's 40 per cent joint venture in Peru, a low-cost,
high-yield leaching operation. Together, Newmont's share of proven reserves
in Oregon, Peru and Uzbekistan total 4.3m ounces. Two ventures in Indonesia
and one in Thailand are also under development, with Newmont geologists
prospecting in other areas in Asia, including Vietnam and China.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Commodities (Week in the markets): Gold market surges still
higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD CONTINUED to hold centre-stage on the world commodities scene this week
as options-related activity added to the upward momentum generated at the
end of last month by the concerted operations of two high-profile
international investors.
Most buyers seemed to have taken the day off on Monday following last week's
exertions, but with producer selling not making its expected appearance the
market was still able to edge up a few cents. That bolstered the buyers
confidence and they had little trouble pushing the price through resistance
at Dollars 370 a troy ounce on the way to Wednesday's 27-month high of
Dollars 384.50 an ounce on the London bullion market.
That was more than Dollars 40 above the level ruling four weeks ago when the
market learnt that Sir James Goldsmith had sold Dollars 400m worth of shares
in Newmont Mining, the biggest US gold producer, to Mr George Soros and had
used some of the money to buy gold options.
A retracement from the mid-week peak was linked by some New York traders to
unconfirmed reports that Mr Soros had been selling gold. They said the
reports had 'spooked' the market, although analysts were generally highly
sceptical about them. 'They haven't achieved any credibility,' Mr George
Milling-Stanley, analyst at Lehman Brothers told the Reuter news agency. But
he thought they might nevertheless be doing the market a service by helping
to 'shake out some of the silly money'.
The shake-out, which took the gold price down to Dollars 372 at one stage,
seemed to be over yesterday, however, when it consolidated to end at Dollars
375.15 an ounce, up Dollars 1.90 on the day and Dollars 7.35 on the week.
Traders thought the short-term technical outlook remained bullish and there
was optimism for the longer term. In a report issued yesterday Union
Bancaire Privee, a Geneva-based private bank, suggested that a further rise
in the gold price to between Dollars 380 and Dollars 400 an ounce looked
justified in coming months. It said market fundamentals had improved with
production levelling off, demand picking up and sales by Russia and central
banks likely to diminish.
Looking still further ahead Mr Paul Lennie, deputy managing director of Mase
Westpac, a leading bullion house, told mining analysts in London that he
expected the bull market to be maintained over the next year. In the absence
of central bank selling and with diminished forward sales by producers the
gold price had to rise, he said, and heavy overhead resistance at Dollars
440 an ounce was likely to be tested 'sometime in the next 12 months'.
At the London Metal Exchange copper prices continued last week's rally,
helped by a 6.7 per cent rise in April US housing starts, but failed to
break resistance at the equivalent of Dollars 1,850 a tonne for the three
months delivery contract. That level was briefly exceeded yesterday as the
market continued to defy bearish fundamentals and shrugged off a further
rise in exchange warehouse stocks to a nine-year high. But the price slipped
back to just below Dollars 1,840 a tonne at the close. In sterling terms the
three months position was Pounds 37 up on the week at Dollars 1,201.50 a
tone.
Lead was again the weakest LME market as warehouse stocks rose to a fresh
record of 254,125 tonnes. The three months price slide another Pounds 9 on
the week to a 6 3/4 -year low of Pounds 265.25 a tonne.
Three months tin reversed an early rise to end Dollars 37.50 down on the
week at Dollars 5,505 a tonne. It had touched Dollars 5,500 yesterday
morning before finding support.
The market derived little encouragement from a meeting last weekend of the
Association of Tin Producing Countries, from which officials were reported
to have emerged confused about what action to take to try to shore up world
prices.
Mr Redzwan Sumun, the association's executive secretary said its members,
who account for about 60 per cent of world tin production, were debating
whether it was worthwhile carrying on with their export quota scheme. The
ATPC estimates world tin stocks at about 40,000 tonnes, double the level it
had originally set as the target for the end of this year.
Producers outside the ATPC, like Peru, Burma, Vietnam and Portugal, have
been increasing their tin exports, while the foreign exchange-hungry former
Soviet Union, which used to be a big importer, has become an exporter.
London's robusta coffee market put in a stronger performance as short
positions were covered against the possibility of progress being made at
weekend producer talks on proposals to withhold beans from the market in an
effort to push prices to more a remunerative level. The July position
finished at Dollars 947 a tonne, up Dollars 19 on the day and Dollars 61 on
the week.
Technically-inspired selling weighed down raw sugar prices and New York's
October futures contract was trading late yesterday at 12.31 cents a lb,
down 0.50 on the week, having moved below 12 cents at one stage.
Nearby prices are still some 30 per cent higher than they were three months
ago but investors are looking for signs of improved demand before restoring
the uptrend.
On the supply side there was more bullish news this week when C. Czarnikow,
the London broker, cut its forecast of world production in 1992-93 by 3m
tonnes to 111.6m tonnes. It now predicts a supply deficit of 2.84m tonnes.

FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Albion advances 50% to Pounds 507,940
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Albion, the Northern Ireland-based maker of tailored mens
wear, showed a 50 per cent improvement, from Pounds 338,378 to Pounds
507,940, in the half year ended March.
Turnover was up by Pounds 1.72m to Pounds 9.14m. Earnings per share came out
at 9.6p (5.6p) and the interim dividend is being raised to 1.6p (1.2p).
The company said its order book was satisfactory, bearing in mind that trade
on the high street remained highly competitive.
Further profit improvement is dependent on growth, the directors said. And
with this in mind the acquisition of Maitland Menswear was finalised on
April 30 this year.

FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Richards Pounds 0.33m in the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLLAPSE in spending on home furnishings in the second half of the
period left pre-tax profits at Richards, the Aberdeen-based textile company,
with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 326,000 for the six months to March 31.
The comparable loss was Pounds 1.94m, restated for FRS 3, after taking in
the loss of Pounds 1.65m on disposal of the linen activities. Operating
losses this time were Pounds 349,000 against losses of Pounds 76,000, which
included profits on continuing activities of Pounds 277,000.
In the second half the performance has improved with the housing market
recovering and exports increasing.
Turnover was Pounds 34.6m (Pounds 37m) of which Pounds 144,000 (Pounds
1.88m) related to discontinued activities. Losses per share came out at
0.63p (5.97p). The interim dividend is held at 1.07p.

FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Brent bears brunt of recession - Trading at
the chemicals group has hit a wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD LANE of Horsell, chairman of Brent Chemicals and grandee of the
Conservative party, is not a popular man in the City. In March his
chairman's statement accompanying the results rang with confidence for the
future; though European markets were weak, the US market was improving, and
he praised the successful strategy of expanding internationally.
By this Thursday, his view had changed dramatically. Lord Lane told the AGM
that profits for the speciality chemicals company for the first half would
be well below those for the same period in 1992.
US recovery has not worked through to industrial companies, and in
continental Europe - which provides 55 per cent of profits - recession,
particularly in Germany and Spain, has hit hard. As a result, the shares
shed 26p to 103p, down from the 165p high in March, leaving analysts
floundering as to where they should pitch forecasts for the year.
From owning a share that carried an above average yield and some recovery
potential, shareholders must now question whether their dividend will still
be paid - or at least whether it will be covered by earnings.
Mr Steve Cuthbert, chief executive, chooses not make a profits forecast.
Chastened and disappointed, he does say the following; 'A shareholder
concerned if he would get a dividend or not would be over-reacting to the
position.'
But the abrupt turnround in trading is not the first time Brent shareholders
have been disappointed by their board. The company's progress has been
funded partly by organic growth. But it has also had a string of placings
and rights issues, to the extent that earnings per share are lower now than
they were in 1987.
Most recently Brent followed a 1991 rights issue to buy Hebro in Germany
with a March 1992 profits warning. Credibility was just beginning to be
restored when this latest warning came. While the Stock Exchange might
applaud Brent for favouring a public statement, rather than a series of
meetings with key brokers, the City would have preferred more realism first
time around.
As often happens when a company's trading hits a wall, attention has focused
on the balance sheet it must now fall back on. While the company has called
this 'strong' and claimed no net debt at the end of last year, some analysts
remain concerned. With unfortunate timing, Hoare Govett's long time bear of
Brent, Mr Martin Evans, turned a buyer only days before the latest profit
warning, but even then pointed to the creeping level of debt.
One reason for this is deferred payments for past acquisitions. Payments of
Pounds 7.8m this year - Pounds 5.7m is payable in 1994 - would have pushed
gearing to 40 per cent by the end of 1993 on the pre-warning figures. Mr
Cuthbert recognises it will be somewhat higher now.
But Brent does not include another Pounds 6.5m of finance leases or Pounds
12m of preference shares, which some analysts think should be considered as
part of debt. It is stretching definitions to call this a strong balance
sheet, although Mr Cuthbert says interest is covered seven times by profits.
Operationally, Brent is facing considerable constraints. It has a limited
scope to improve profits in Germany - which accounts for 30 per cent of
income - or in the rest of Europe, which together provided 55 per cent of
the Pounds 11.5m profits in 1992. With the exception of British Vita, Brent
has the highest relative exposure to the weakening Continental economy of
any UK chemicals company.
And the company has already enjoyed 18 months of the usual cost cutting and
overhead control medicine. It therefore remains heavily dependent on these
unpromising economies, slowing their slide into recession.
Sales of some of its products - packaging inks and coatings, and metal
treatment chemicals - are heavily dependent on an economic upturn in its
markets - a factor which even better management could not control.
Brent now has an exceptionally tough task to restore credibility and some
shareholders may decide they have had enough.
Its message about European and US markets has not been missed by a wider
audience. Following Brent's warning, Burmah Castrol shares fell yesterday on
fears of its German exposure through its Foseco subsidiary. Courtaulds and
Hickson also slipped. Recovery may be around the corner, but it is turning
out to be a longer corner than many imagined.

FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Sticky patch for abrasive entrepreneur -
The career of Clive Smith, former chairman of Petranol
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CLIVE Smith was 25 years old when he made his first million pounds. He
had started with one truck, built up a transport company and sold it to
Unilever.
Mr Smith had expanded the business by trucking subsidised meat from the
Irish Republic to Turkey. He claims that, by the time he sold it, Comarte
Europa International, was the biggest international refrigerated transport
company in the European common market.
That sale was in 1974, paving the way for Mr Smith, a self-made man with a
flair for deal-making, to move on to promote the Stock Exchange flotation of
several natural resources companies in the 1980s.
At the moment his career has hit a sticky patch. The share prices of many of
the companies in which he has substantial shareholdings have collapsed. The
Serious Fraud Office is investigating possible irregular share dealings in
two of them - Butte Mining and Richmond Oil &amp; Gas - and he is negotiating
with his cred-itors.
He had a three-year contract with Unilever to continue managing Comarte but
his style did not match that of a big corporation and the contract was ended
by mutual agreement after 12 months.
He subsequently owned and managed companies in industrial property, plant
hire, industrial chemicals and car hire and leasing. He once told a
colleague that he became fascinated by commodity trading. Then one day which
is for ever etched in his memory, he made a Pounds 100,000 profit in the
morning but lost Pounds 250,000 in the afternoon. 'I realised commodity
trading could become addictive so I quit,' he said.
Mr Smith had his first taste of what the natural resources sector had to
offer in September 1977 when he acquired Parkland Colliery, a private coal
mine needing modernisation. It was a wonderful deal. Parkland had cash in
its books but he bought the company on deferred terms. He had already
established, drawing on his transport and plant hire experience, that
Parkland owned a great deal of good, saleable mechanical equipment and
plant. Asset sales covered the whole of the purchase price.
Colleagues say the simplicity of the Parkland deal made an indelible
impression on Mr Smith. 'He always looks for deals where there is no
downside for him,' said one.
In 1978 he acquired Podmore Hall Colliery Company which had a license to
mine substantial coal reserves. By 1981 Podmore had become the biggest
privately owned coal mine in the UK. That year both coal companies, which
had been bought for a total of Pounds 250,000, were sold to Anglo
International Mining for Pounds 1.875m.
Mr Smith said at the time that he sold out of coal because he felt that
investment in the production and development of oil and gas would show a
greater return on his capital. So he invested some of the proceeds in the US
oil and gas industry. In September 1981, with some partners, he set up a
chemical trading company to supply the oil and gas industry. Through the
contacts this brought, Mr Smith was introduced to some oil and gas prospects
and in October 1982 his company acquired its first interest in this sector.
In 1983 the company changed its name to Petranol and in February the
following year it was launched on the London Stock Exchange. Some 2.8m
shares, or 27 per cent of the equity, were offered for sale at 125p a share,
valuing Petranol at Pounds 13m. Mr Smith controlled 3.8m shares or 36.5 per
cent, worth, at the launch, Pounds 4.75m.
The Petranol launch forced Mr Smith into the public eye for one of the very
few times in his career. It was a time when Dallas was among the most
popular television shows so for a while newspapers were calling him 'the JR
of the Potteries'.
In fact, his home is between Nantwich and Crewe and some of his
acquaintances call him, unkindly, because he lost a thumb in a car accident,
'the nine-fingered, fat man from Cheshire.' This is not entirely fair
because, although a little portly, Mr Smith is not fat. One acquaintance
says: 'It is just that he looks as if he lives on chip butties.'
He has a benevolent but forceful north country manner and can be very
charming. But he can also be volatile if he is crossed. 'He likes to bark at
people and uses lawyers letters and writs a lot,' said one business
colleague. Another said: 'He is a guy who is easy to fall out with. He can
be very charming but he can be abrasive too.'
Like many north country businessmen, often with good reason, Mr Smith is
very distrustful of the City and its establishment.
This distrust intensified after the Petranol board in March 1986 voted him
out of the chairmanship. He subsequently left the board but was back in the
limelight again only weeks later when Petranol received an all-paper bid
worth Pounds 21m from another small oil and gas company, Inoco.
The Takeover Panel intervened and took the unusual step of ruling that Inoco
and Mr Smith had been acting in concert. It said Inoco should add a cash
alternative to its offer. Inoco did not have the financial resources for
this so it had to drop the bid. At that time it was said Inoco owned 6.6 per
cent of Petranol and Mr Smith 25 per cent. They undertook to reduce their
combined holdings to below the 29.9 per cent which automatically triggered a
bid.
Mr Smith seems to prefer to keep in the background, often not even taking a
non-executive directorship in those companies he has helped bring to market
or in which his family trusts have big shareholdings.
Consequently he uses a large number of people to do his bidding. One person
who has had business dealings with Mr Smith says: 'He has more accountants
and advisers than anyone I have ever known. He also has used up more lawyers
than anyone I have ever known.'
Mr Smith recently described himself as 'an independent businessman who acts
internationally as an adviser and consultant in the sale and purchase of
companies, generally with oil, gas or mineral assets in the US.'
Virtually all of his interests are held in offshore trusts. 'My entire
affairs are dealt with offshore by different administrators,' he said
recently. He has told acquaintances that this is because he does not trust
the City of London and its representatives.
In spite of this dislike, Mr Smith took a substantial shareholding in
Corporate Broking Services, set up by Mr David Wilkinson after he left TC
Coombes, another stockbroker. Mr Smith had several dealings with Coombes
which in the mid-1980s was one of the most aggressive broking houses in the
natural resources sector. Coombes went into receivership and CBS went into
liquidation in 1991.
These brokers were involved with Mr Smith in the Stock Exchange flotations
of Butte Mining, Richmond Oil &amp; Gas and Globe Petroleum (launched first as
Far East Resources). Mr Smith also took a substantial shareholding in
another resource company, Geevor, which started as a Cornish tin miner.
Acquaintances speak in awe of Mr Smith's capacity for hard work. He
frequently commutes on the 7am train from Crewe to London and does not
return until 11 at night. 'You can often find him in his office at
midnight,' said one.
In his more mellow moods, Mr Smith frequently tells people that he is not
interested in money for himself but is working to secure the future of his
two daughters.
However, some acquaintances suggest that, like many entrepreneurs today, he
is not as rich as he once was and that many of his assets are pledged to the
banks as collateral for loans.

FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: New computer trade association
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of small UK personal computer companies yesterday launched a new
trade association with the object of improving the reputation of suppliers
who sell 'direct' - through newspaper and magazine advertisements, writes
Alan Cane.
Mr Keith Warburton, a personal computer consultant and founder of the
Personal Computer Direct Marketers' Association said it had been formed
after the failure of a number of direct marketing companies in recent
months.
The PCDMA will not reimburse customers for money lost if a company fails but
it insists that its members meet minimum standards including a two year
track record.
The larger personal computer companies have shown little interest in joining
the association.

FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Isosceles agrees debt package and
standstill extension with lenders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ISOSCELES, the heavily-indebted parent of the Gateway food retail chain,
said yesterday that its lending banks had agreed a restructuring package for
its Pounds 1.4bn debts.
Its current standstill agreement, under which debt repayment was suspended
last year pending agreement on the restructuring, has been extended beyond
its May 28 deadline.
This is to allow time for shareholders to decide on the package at an
extraordinary general meeting likely in the last week of June.
The restructuring, put to lenders in early April, creates a new company,
Gateway Holdings, to assume responsibility for Pounds 500m of debt, while
the balance of about Pounds 923m will remain in Isosceles in a restructured
form.
Gateway Holdings will run the Gateway Foodmarkets Group and will be
wholly-owned by Isosceles, a highly leveraged management buy-out vehicle. It
ran into trouble when recession and the slump in values of retail businesses
meant that disposals planned to cover debt could not be made at high enough
prices.
Gateway Holdings will have no liability for Isosceles' debt and in effect
will be 'ringfenced' from the borrowings.
Gateway this week announced a price and promotion campaign, making permanent
price reductions on between 1,000 and 1,500 lines across a range of
products.

FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram board wins day on auditor

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGRY small shareholders tried but failed to oust Arthur Andersen as auditor
to Spring Ram, the manufacturer of kitchens, bathrooms and home improvement
products, at the company's AGM in Leeds.
They won on a show of hands by 48 to 40, but Mr Bill Rooney, chairman, said
he had 105m proxy votes for reappointment and only 8m against. The vote on
the floor was re-taken and most of those against then abstained.
However, this was the only blemish on the day for Mr Rooney, Spring Ram's
founder. Shareholders backed him after he apologised for management mistakes
and promised appointment of a second non-executive director and a strong
finance director within weeks.
Clearly nervous, Mr Rooney told the packed meeting of about 200 people that
a senior manager in Balterley Bathrooms, a subsidiary, had overstated
profits to impress his superiors, mainly by manipulating stock figures. No
money was stolen, Mr Rooney said, and the fraud was so clever that neither
management nor auditors could have reasonably been expected to spot it.
The report and accounts and dividend were approved unanimously on a show of
hands, as was the election of Mr Roy Barber, a company doctor.

FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Clive Smith faces creditors in fight
against bankruptcy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CLIVE SMITH, the Midlands entrepreneur known for his involvement in the
flotations of several natural resources companies in London in the 1980s,
will seek to avoid personal bankruptcy next month when he faces creditors
demanding repayment of about Pounds 20m.
Mr Smith has been involved in UK quoted companies such as Butte Mining,
Geevor, Petranol, Richmond Oil &amp; Gas and Globe Petroleum, formerly called
Far East Resources.
The Serious Fraud Office has launched an investigation into at least two,
Richmond and Butte, following a raid on the offices of Bryant &amp; Co, a Jersey
accountant last year.
Mr Smith is due to meet a group of 15 creditors in London on June 7 where he
will propose to repay approximately 8p for every pound of debt owed, against
0.1p if he is forced into bankruptcy.
The meeting was scheduled for Monday but was adjourned following questions
from some creditors over certain debt claims. In order to be approved, the
arrangement must be approved by creditors representing 75 per cent of the
debt.
Some Pounds 12m is being claimed by Richard Pearce &amp; Sons, a Hong Kong
registered company. The address for Richard Pearce is listed in Mr Smith's
schedule of creditors as Danore, Drogheda, Co Meath, Ireland. This is the
same address as Mr Kelvin Myles, who managed many of Mr Smith's offshore
interests from an accountant's office in Jersey.
A further Pounds 3.8m is being claimed by Newsham Investments, an offshore
vehicle for the Smith family.
Other creditors include Societe Banquaire de Paris, which a court ruled in
November was owed Pounds 2.7m by Mr Smith. Last year the bank issued
proceedings against him to recover this amount, the balance of a Pounds 3m
loan made in 1990.
Mr Smith offered security in the form of shares in Geevor, Richmond, Butte,
and two other companies, Western &amp; Pacific and Image Store Holdings. The
value of the collateral is at present estimated at Pounds 1.5m.
In his voluntary arrangement, Mr Smith has proposed to repay Pounds 12,000
in the first year of the agreement, the proceeds from his work as a 'finance
cum project consultant'.
Mr Smith argues that he would be able to improve his contribution in the
second and third years and holds out the promise of a further Pounds 1.67m
payment if he is able to recover money due to the CJ Smith Life Trust.

FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Owen &amp; Robinson restructures capital and
makes Pounds 2.1m placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OWEN &amp; ROBINSON, the jewellery and sports footwear retailer, has announced
plans to overcome its high level of debt and accumulated losses and finance
development by raising Pounds 2.1m through a placing and open offer.
Mr Alan Gaynor, chief executive, said that the company had done as much it
could to 'get a grip on the losses' but it would be unable to move forward
without a capital reconstruction.
The company also reported pre-tax losses for the year to January 31 of
Pounds 2.53m (Pounds 2.92m) on turnover of Pounds 25.5m (Pounds 26.3m).
The reconstruction involves the agreed conversion into equity of Pounds 2m
of debt held by Hill Samuel, the company's principal banker, Pounds 1.35m of
loan notes held by two principal shareholders and Pounds 1.1m nominal of A
preference shares.
It is proposed to convert the Pounds 8.2m nominal convertible preference
shares at a rate nearly six times greater than the existing provisions and
make a capital reduction involving the elimination of the share premium
account and the capital redemption reserve and consolidate the present 1p
shares into 20p shares.
Mr Gaynor and Mr Mike Smith, finance director, are being given options over
a total of 1.05m shares at 27p.
Credit Lyonnais Laing is placing or will subscribe for 9.25m new shares.
Existing shareholders are being offered the shares at 27p each on the basis
of 171 for every 100 new shares.
As a result of the changes Mr Gaynor said that gearing would be cut from
2,200 per cent to 35 per cent.
The loss for the year was after exceptional charges of Pounds 1.13m (Pounds
832,000). Losses per share were 7.6p (12.88p).

FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: 300 jobs go in East Midlands Electricity
cost cutting move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EAST MIDLANDS Electricity is to cut 300 jobs and reduce the size of its
headquarters in a restructuring of the core business which will also see a
rationalisation of the board of directors.
Yesterday's announcement is the latest in a series of cost-cutting moves by
electricity companies. Like several others in the sector, East Midlands is
consolidating the number of districts and sharpening its focus on profits.
Thirteen districts, which have in the past been cost centres, will be turned
into seven profit centres. The management of profits from buying and selling
electricity will be devolved to the regions.
At the top of the company the 11-person board is being cut by two.
Mr Keith Jackson is taking early retirement and Mr Philip Champ, while
retaining responsibility for generation and overseas operations, is
relinquishing his board position.
The restructuring of the distribution business will cut annual operating
costs by about Pounds 10m.
The job losses, which will take place over 18 months, are expected to cost
Pounds 13m, but Mr John Harris, chairman, said this was already built into
cost forecasts.
The 300 job losses follow a reduction of 100 in the last year and 400 since
privatisation. Mr Harris said the move was part of a gradual process, rather
than a step change.
Middle management jobs would be cut, said Mr Harris. Others would move out
of head office to the business units.
The seven business units are Coventry, Derby, Leicester, Lincoln, Milton
Keynes, Northamptonshire and Nottingham.
The new structure incorporates a six month pilot project at Derby which the
company says resulted in wider spans of control and shorter lines of
communication.

<TEXT>
ANGRY small shareholders tried but failed to oust Arthur Andersen as auditor
to Spring Ram, the Yorkshire manufacturer of kitchens, bathrooms and home
improvement products, at the company's AGM in Leeds yesterday.
They won on a show of hands by 48 to 40, but Mr Bill Rooney, the chairman,
said he had 105m proxy votes for reappointment of the accountancy firm and
only 8m against. The vote on the floor was re-taken and most of those
against then abstained.
However, this was the only blemish on the day for Mr Rooney, Spring Ram's
founder. Shareholders backed him unanimously after he apologised for
management mistakes and promised appointment of a second non-executive
director and a strong finance director within weeks.
The value of Spring Ram's shares has halved recently after two surprises.
First, the company revealed false accounting at a subsidiary. Then shares
were suspended briefly to allow an announcement that last year's pre-tax
profits would be nearly Pounds 13m below expectations of Pounds 39m after
Arthur Andersen had insisted on a more conservative approach.
Clearly nervous, Mr Rooney told the packed meeting of about 200 people that
a senior manager in Balterley Bathrooms, a subsidiary, had overstated
profits to impress his superiors, mainly by manipulating stock figures.
Although no money was stolen, Mr Rooney said, the fraud was so clever that
neither management nor auditors could have reasonably been expected to spot
it.
Mr Rooney added that all new accounting standards had been, or would be,
introduced ahead of obligations. New systems also ensured that no manager
could act alone to falsify figures, reducing risks of problems arising
again.
Spring Ram's report and accounts and dividend were approved unanimously on a
show of hands, as was the election of Mr Roy Barber, a company doctor. Mr
Barber will supervise internal audit and oversee corporate governance
policy.
Mr Rooney said Spring Ram had continued investing heavily throughout the
recession. 'But we didn't expect 4 1/2 years of depressed times. Had we
known, we would have phased developments.'

FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley static in chilly
climate - Trading areas are 'battleground for market share'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOLVERHAMPTON &amp; Dudley Breweries, reporting a marginal increase in
first-half profits, said yesterday that its trading area in the Midlands and
north-west England had become, 'the battleground for market share' between
the national brewers.
'We cannot avoid some of the effects,' said Mr David Miller, chairman.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to March 28 edged ahead from Pounds
16.52m to Pounds 16.65m in a trading climate that was 'still pretty chilly.'
Excluding property and investment disposals, profits declined from Pounds
16.1m to Pounds 15.97m.
Earnings per share rose slightly from 17.6p to 17.7p while the interim
dividend is increased 9.3 per cent to 4.7p.
Trading profit of Pounds 18.55m was 2.8 per cent higher on turnover 5.3 per
cent ahead, at Pounds 107.3m, with a full contribution from the Camerons
brewery acquisition,
Beer volumes declined by 'a not discouraging' 0.6 per cent. Operating
margins were under pressure from competition in the wholesale trade, and
from rising costs of maintaining service standards to pub customers, but
brewing costs were reduced. Trading margins fell from 17.7 per cent to 17.3
per cent.
Mr Miller said:'We aim to avoid the disruption to margins in the wholesale
trade arising from the larger brewers' market share ambitions. Improved
profitability is much more likely to be achieved by lower production and
distribution costs and an improvement in managed house throughputs than
through the wholesale trade.'
Margins improved in the tenanted estate, but pubs classified as 'boozers'
suffered from the recession, particularly in the building industry. 'It is
the skilled hourly-paid man who has been the backbone of trade in these
pubs. For him, this recession has been interminable, and he is hard up,'
said Mr Miller.
Camerons expanded its distribution and pub estate in north -east England,
but operating profits do not yet match the carrying costs of the acquisition
made in January last year.
Aggressive bidding for conference and business trade lifted hotels' turnover
by 9.7 per cent.

FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Brixton Estate seeks Pounds 100.7m - Other
property companies expected to make cash calls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIXTON Estate, the seventh largest property group in the UK, yesterday
launched a 2-for-5 rights issue to raise Pounds 100.7m to take advantage of
low property prices.
The new shares are being offered at 155p. Yesterday the shares rose 11p to
207p.
Brixton is the second big property company after Slough Estates to tap
shareholders. Analysts believe other property companies may embark on
similar exercises.
The cash call, a further sign that confidence is beginning to return to the
battered property sector, should find favour with institutional investors.
In the last few months, a growing number have started to move back into the
property market, believing it will begin to recover within the next 18
months.
Mr Harry Axton, chairman, said: 'Since the company went public in the
thirties we have only had one rights issue which raised Pounds 15m in 1980.
We resist asking shareholders for money if we can manage without it.'
The value of Brixton's property portfolio at the year-end dropped from
Pounds 724m to Pounds 679m. Net borrowings rose to Pounds 346m, representing
gearing of 114 per cent.
With significant undrawn borrowing facilities still available, Mr Axton said
the group had not been under any pressure to raise new finance.
A quarter of the debt is repayable over the following five years and 1 per
cent within 12 months.
Two of Brixton's biggest shareholders, Clerical Medical &amp; General Life
Assurance Society and Royal Insurance Asset Management, which own 37.4 per
cent of the group, have undertaken to take up their rights. The rest of the
issue is underwritten by J Henry Schroder Wagg.
'If we are going to take advantage of the present situation we need more
money,' said Mr Axton. 'We are looking for the right sort of properties,
which are let or partially let.'
Mr Axton said he had spotted 'short green shoots' in the letting business,
the number of sales, however, was still small compared to the increase in
new visits.
Net rental income last year was in excess of Pounds 55m and the majority was
derived from tenants described by the group as 'good quality credit risks'.
The group holds land where planning permission exists for 600,000 sq ft of
industrial and office space.
Shareholders will be asked to approve the increase in share capital at an
extraordinary general meeting on June 7.

FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Ferraris profit boost and Pounds 2m rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FERRARIS, the medical equipment and specialist engineering group, formerly
known as Stainless Metalcraft, yesterday moved to strengthen its financial
base with a two-for-three rights issue to raise Pounds 1.95m and said it is
applying for its shares to be admitted to the official list.
The group also announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 251,000 for the six
months to last February, compared with Pounds 77,000 in the same period of
1991/92. Turnover rose to Pounds 5.43m against Pounds 4.83m. Ferraris
returned to profit in the year to last August, after two years of losses.
The rights issue is priced at 55p a share, a discount of 12p to its
overnight price. It has been underwritten by Singer &amp; Friedlander in
Birmingham and brokers are Peel, Hunt.
Proceeds of the rights will be used to buy the freehold of its main
operating site at Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, as well as the outstanding
minority interest in its US subsidiary and reduce gearing.
Between 1989 and 1991, when Ferraris reorganised its business, moving out of
general engineering, gearing rose from 70 to 154 per cent and last year was
98 per cent. After the rights issue it will fall to under 20 per cent and
said Mr Ken Baker, the chairman, 'we plan to keep it that way for the
future.'
He described the fund-raising as 'tidying up the garden,' a financial
reorganisation to complement the operational reorganisation. One element of
this has been to widen the shareholder base.
The directors and the Childs family, holders of the largest block of shares,
are renouncing their rights entitlement so that their combined holdings will
decline from 40 per cent to under 24 per cent of the equity.
Based on earnings per share of 2.4p, against 0.7p in the comparable half,
shareholders will receive an interim dividend of 0.75p a share. In 1991/92
they received no interim, but a final of 1p.

FT  22 MAY 93 / It's lost that faltering feeling: A couple of weak spots in
the UK economy do not detract from current optimism about the recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's economic recovery is still on track after a week of wayward
statistics which left egg on forecasters' faces.
For a day or two, reports that retail sales fell unexpectedly in April and
manufacturing output dipped in March suggested that recovery was faltering.
But these doubts were confounded by Thursday's equally surprising news that
seasonally adjusted unemployment fell in April for the third month in a row
 -by 1,400 to 2.94m.
The week's blips have brought the recovery back to earth. Between December
and February, manufacturing output increased by a spectacular 2.7 per cent
after a year of stagnation, while in the same two months the volume of
retail sales rose by 2.2 per cent.
Such growth rates were clearly unsustainable. The latest hints of a
corrugated upturn after months of the economy bumping along the bottom of
the business cycle suggest that the recovery is likely to be moderate. This
will be no bad thing, if it means that inflationary pressures stay subdued.
But at the same time, the controversy surrounding Mr Michael Portillo, the
chief secretary of the Treasury, amid reports of Treasury plans to cut
health and social security spending, is a reminder of problems further down
the line.
The recovery could still hit the buffers. Recession in continental Europe is
a growing worry for exporters although Britain may be increasing its share
of total world trade. Britain's budget and current account deficits are more
intractable problems that could one day trigger a crisis of confidence if
financial markets believe they are running out of control.
For the moment, however, international investors are relatively optimistic
about the British economy, as evidenced by sterling's firm performance over
the past week. Yesterday's news that the annual rate of retail price
inflation fell last month to 1.3 per cent - its lowest level for nearly 30
years - while bank and building society lending grew by a larger than
expected Pounds 2.9bn suggest that the UK may succeed in using sterling's
devaluation since September to spur economic growth without falling prey to
high inflation. However, the future path of inflation is likely to be
upwards.
But this week's news has also left a strong impression that something
special is happening in UK manufacturing industry, which has emerged as the
main beneficiary of the devaluation. April's fall in unemployment was
unspectacular compared with declines of more than 25,000 in each of the
preceding two months. But other official figures on Thursday showed that
seasonally adjusted employment in manufacturing industry rose by 5,000 in
March and by 11,000 in the first quarter after years of decline.
'You have to go back to the 1960s to find the start of a recovery in which
manufacturing employment rises,' comments Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist
at Kleinwort Benson, the investment bank. The last time that manufacturing
employment increased for three successive months was in 1988, when the UK
economy was booming. The long term post-war trend in manufacturing
employment has been inexorably downwards: from a peak of 7.89m in June 1971
to about 4.2m today.
Almost certainly, there are special factors behind the rise. Many companies
were too quick to shed labour in the dark days of last September when
business and consumer confidence slumped after sterling's forced departure
from the European exchange rate mechanism. The labour market reforms of the
1980s and the much tougher disciplines imposed on managements by financial
markets seem also to have encouraged a 'hire and fire' culture in Britain
more akin to that of the US than Britain's European Community partners.
Some growth in the manufacturing workforce could also reflect increased
economic growth. But here government and independent economists are
cautious. Nobody is suggesting that unemployment will not rise again.
What is clear, however, is that manufacturers have come through the
recession in reasonably good fettle. The 0.3 per cent fall in manufacturing
output between February and March seems to have been statistical 'noise'
rather than evidence of the recovery's fragility.
Manufacturers report rising orders and expect further increases in output.
The Bank of England says their profitability was maintained through the
recession. Manufacturing productivity is growing strongly: up 7.8 per cent
in the three months to the end of March compared with the first quarter of
last year. Unit labour costs are falling: down an annual 2.9 per cent over
the same period. By contrast, the Bank of England is forecasting a 9.8 per
cent increase in the unit labour costs of west German manufacturers this
year.
Mr Spencer believes the improved fortunes of Britain's manufacturers could
trigger 'an emulation effect' in other parts of the economy. There is some
anecdotal evidence to support such hopes. Mr Charles Burton, joint managing
director of Business Strategies, an economic consultancy, has noticed a
change in his customers' requirements that might point to future economic
growth.
'A financial institution, two retailers and even some construction companies
have asked BSL to think about where in the UK they should expand their
activities,' Mr Burton says. 'That is first time we have had such business
since the late 1980s.'
But manufacturing is too small a part of the economy to ensure recovery on
its own. The key to sustained growth lies with the hitherto
recession-shocked British consumer.
Here too there are encouraging signs. April's surprise 0.3 per cent decline
in retail sales compared with March has to be set against a sharp
improvement in consumer confidence as measured by Gallup, the opinion poll
company, and a survey this week from the Confederation of British Industry
forecasting further increases in retail sales in May.
The high levels of debt and debt-servicing costs, which have crimped
consumer demand, may also be easing slightly. The accompanying chart, based
on Bank of England data, shows how personal income gearing (which measures
personal sector interest payments as a proportion of disposable income) has
fallen to about 10 per cent from 14 per cent in 1990, largely because of
falling mortgage interest rates. The recent slight rise in house prices may
have halted the rise in capital gearing, the measure of outstanding lending
as a proportion of consumers' financial and tangible wealth.
One of the most hopeful indicators is the May Gallup survey of unemployment
expectations. The 28 percentage point gap between the 49 per cent of
respondents expecting unemployment to rise and the 21 per cent expecting it
to fall was the smallest since May 1990 and suggests that fear of losing
one's job is falling sharply.
If so, the way will be open for a more broadly based upturn, supported by a
more active housing market and increased personal borrowing.
But the recovery is bound to be modest so long as the economy is weighed
down by Britain's current account and budget deficits and the prospect of
future tax increases and public spending cuts to correct these problems.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Letter: Selective briefings 'patently unfair' to the small
investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr I CAMERON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I fully support the action of the London Stock Exchange in cracking
down on selective leaking of price-sensitive information ('Crackdown on
private briefings for analysts', May 15/16). As a hobby in my retirement, I
am a small investor in the equity of London-listed companies. I believe that
all the generally known facts relevant to making investment decisions are
reflected in the price of a company's shares and, with this in mind, I have
written a simple program in Basic which, when run on my pc, extracts this
information and suggests which shares are a good buy.
At present I scan 125 listed companies daily. I also use information
acquired via the FT's 'Free annual report service' and the 'Directors' share
transactions in their own companies' listed in the FT. I supplement this
with data from Monday's FT and Extel cards.
In each of the years that my program has influenced my share dealings, the
increase in the net value (after allowing for actual buying and expected
selling costs) of investments has comfortably exceeded the increase in the
FT-SE 100 Index. Indeed, I would consider I had failed if it had not done
so.
It would seem patently unfair if, after I had taken all this trouble, a
'group of analysts and institutions' were handed, on a plate, price
sensitive information denied to the rest of us.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Tough road to travel: The challenges facing Adele Biss, the
new head of the British Tourist Authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Adele Biss smiled broadly for the cameras in central London yesterday as
the government announced she was to be Britain's new tourism chief.
If she is still smiling when her term as chairman of the British Tourist
Authority and the English Tourist Board ends in three years that will be an
achievement in itself. Her predecessor, ex-Punch editor Mr William Davis,
rounded off his stint by declaring: 'The pay is absurd and the chances of
achieving any worthwhile results are slim.'
Ms Biss, who takes up the part-time, Pounds 35,000 a year appointment on
June 1, has the advantage that the tourist industry has no preconceived
ideas about her. 'I've never heard of her,' said one senior industry figure.
'No one seems to have heard of her.'
Ms Biss, 48, has, however, had a successful business career. She was a
founder of the Biss Lancaster public relations company which was acquired by
WCRS, the advertising group, in 1985. She was also a non-executive director
of the British Railways Board for five years. She is currently a director of
European Passenger Services, the BR subsidiary that will run rail services
through the Channel tunnel.
In the 1970s, she worked for Thomson Holidays, the UK's biggest travel
group. As a public relations consultant, she represented the Association of
British Travel Agents, Pickfords Travel, Holiday Inn and several charter
airlines and cruise companies. She also, as an economics student at
University College London in the 1960s, took coach-loads of tourists on
10-day trips around Europe, for which they had paid Pounds 19.
While her experience with the travel industry has mostly involved taking
tourists out of the UK rather than bringing them in, she is not a complete
novice. That some in the British travel trade reacted sceptically to her
appointment has far more to do with an unwillingness to believe the
government will treat the industry fairly and generously than with any
personal antipathy.
The UK tourist industry employs 1.5m people - more than the construction
sector or the health service. It represents about 4 per cent of gross
domestic product and contributes Pounds 25bn to the economy annually. Yet it
is barely discussed by ministers. Responsibility for tourism has been passed
from the Department of Trade and Industry to employment and now to the
Department of National Heritage. At national heritage, formed after last
year's general election, tourist industry managers believe they are regarded
as unimportant compared with broadcasting and the arts.
The House of Commons did debate tourism last March, for the first time in
nearly five years. But Mr Robert Key, the national heritage minister, was
derided for his claim during the debate that the flying of more Union Jacks
would assist the industry.
The delay in appointing Ms Biss, when the government had known since last
January that Mr Davis would not be continuing in the post, was seen as
further evidence of official lack of interest.
As always, however, the chief gripe is money. While the BTA's grant is to
rise from Pounds 32.1m this year to Pounds 33.5m in 1995, the ETB's funding
will be cut from Pounds 15.4m this year to Pounds 9.1m in 1995. The BTA
promotes Britain abroad, while the ETB attempts to improve the quality of
tourist facilities and encourage the locals to take their holidays at home.
The government argues that the ETB's work should be done by the 11 English
regional tourist boards.
Some in the industry agree that at a time of public spending cuts, what
money there is should be devoted to the BTA. However, Mr John Jarvis,
chairman of the privately-owned Jarvis Hotels group, who has served as
interim ETB chairman for the past two months, believes Ms Biss should fight
for the ETB's survival. English tourism needs a central co-ordinating board
to ensure that standards are maintained and improved. 'To co-ordinate
tourism will take more than Pounds 9m,' he says.
Mr Jarvis, who described Ms Biss's appointment as a 'refreshing choice',
says that a still unpublished study he has commissioned from management
consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand will strengthen the argument for the ETB's
retention.
Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage minister, accepted, during the
parliamentary debate, that the BTA performs a function which the private
sector cannot. 'Overseas promotion is difficult to organise and the returns
to individual businesses may be quite small and unpredictable - not worth
the investment.
'The industry, unaided, would not put sufficient money and effort into
overseas promotion. The tourism industry is particularly fragmented; it
covers many sectors and it is not in the direct interest of any one private
sector company to promote Britain as a destination,' he said.
While the BTA is a frequent winner of awards for the service offered by its
overseas offices, some comment on how paltry its efforts seem when compared
with other countries.
Mr Mario Bodini, managing director of Jac Travel, which brings tour groups
to the UK, said: 'Given the funds they have available, the BTA, for the most
part, is fairly good. Still, I get quite embarrassed when I'm at
international trade shows and I see that the British stand is feeble
compared with quite small destina-tions such as Holland, Austria or
Portugal.'
Mr Peter Bates, marketing director of the Savoy Hotel group, said the BTA
needed to focus its energies more clearly when promoting the UK's
attractions. He said, for example, that the relative cheapness of the UK to
American visitors after sterling's effective devaluation last September had
not been sufficiently stressed in the US market.
In 1991-2, the BTA received Pounds 24m in funding from the private sector
and other public bodies such as local authorities. Mr Bates argued the BTA
needs to pay more attention to travel companies' views on how that money
should be spent.
Ms Biss insists she is ready to listen and does not think she will suffer
her predecessor's frustrations. 'I would guess my expectations are a little
bit different from what his were. A lot of my past has been spent persuading
people and reconciling different points of view.'
Unlike Mr Davis when he began, she has no illusions about the level of
government support she is likely to get. 'Anyone going into a public
appointment now understands the economic background, the whole problem of
public finances. Maybe I've got a different starting point from him.'

FT  22 MAY 93 / Rogues on the run: Havens are available to fugitives with
cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT Writers
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever the outcome of his flight from Britain three weeks ago, Mr Asil
Nadir looks set to go down in the history books among a long list of
fugitive businessmen who have eluded the arm of the law.
Ensconced in the sunlit fastness of northern Cyprus, the former chairman of
Polly Peck International might ponder the experiences of others who have
swapped the world of high finance for lives removed from the limelight.
Jabez Spencer Balfour, a notorious 19th-century British fraudster, escaped
to Argentina but was brought back to stand trial in 1895. He was given a
14-year sentence to punish what the judge called 'a long career of
cold-blooded villainy by which he has ruined thousands of humble and happy
homes'.
Staying beyond the reach of police and judiciary requires stamina, cash and
top-level contacts, as well as expert knowledge of extradition laws.
A small, secretive industry of companies tracks down fugitives. The work can
be risky. 'People in hiding can play hard-ball,' says one UK accountant
involved in this area. 'There are some you definitely do not want to go
after without protection.'
'You're dealing with sophisticated individuals,' says Mr John Conyngham,
managing director of the UK arm of Kroll Associates, the New York-based
corporate investigations company. Mr Conyngham says the refusal of some
countries to extradite their own nationals can pose problems.
Mr Ted Clements, executive director for consulting and investigations at the
London office of the California-based Pinkerton's security group,
specialises in unravelling cross-border financial transactions. These can be
exotic: Pinkerton's UK operation is considering helping the Russian
government track down 500 tonnes of missing Czarist gold.
One worry for absconders is that the number of countries offering firm
protection is shrinking. China, for instance, has tried conspicuously to
help international justice authorities, part of its efforts to collaborate
with the west.
Spain's Costa del Sol used to be a favourite haunt for suspected criminals,
but the Spanish authorities have now become more helpful on extradition. 'If
the paperwork is put to them, they are more co-operative,' says Mr David
Sherwin, head of fraud investigations and risk management at accountants
Ernst &amp; Young.
Yet there are still plenty of havens. Governments in the Gulf, for instance,
have been reluctant to extradite individuals involved with the collapsed
Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Several key BCCI figures wanted
by the New York district attorney's office are thought to be holed up in the
Middle East.
South-east Asia is a favourite place in which suspects disappear. 'If you
are dealing with poor countries, where money will buy a lot, you do just
that - you buy a lot,' says one Hong Kong police official.
A celebrated Hong Kong case concerned the Ma family, who own the Oriental
Daily, Hong Kong's biggest-selling daily newspaper. Facing drugs-related
charges, the Ma brothers, Ma Shek Yu (or 'White powder' Ma) and Ma Sik Chun,
jumped Hong Kong bail and fled to Taiwan as long ago as 1976.
Somewhat closer to Mr Nadir's current refuge, Switzerland can offer solace
for people fleeing fiscal inquiries, as it does not consider tax evasion a
crime. Mr Octav Botnar, former chairman of the Nissan car importing company
in the UK, was usefully in Switzerland in January last year when the Inland
Revenue issued an arrest warrant for him.
Another well-known Swiss resident is Mr Marc Rich, head of the eponymous
commodity trading group. In 1983 he was charged in New York with
racketeering, fraud, tax evasion and illegally trading with Iran. Mr Rich
moved his headquarters to the tiny but extremely wealthy canton of Zug,
where he and his company have lived comfortably ever since.
Mr Jean Ziegler, a Swiss parliamentarian and author of a book on
Switzerland's role as an illicit financial haven, suggests Mr Nadir could
follow Mr Rich's lead - but underlines he should become a benefactor to the
canton. 'If you do something in the interest of Zug, it will look after
you,' he says.
However, for Mr Werner K Rey, the Swiss financier who formerly headed the
collapsed Omni conglomerate, Switzerland offered no hiding place. Charged
with defrauding the group, Mr Rey disappeared early last year. He was traced
in December to the Bahamas, where he has been trying to block the Swiss
government's extradition demands.
For many fugitive financiers, the main threat to their well-being stems not
from government and judicial authorities, but from creditors. Some may be
seeking both cash and revenge. Fear of reprisals has occasionally led
runaways to seek protective custody. Mr George Koskotas, former chairman of
the Bank of Crete, fled to Brazil in 1988 after being charged with
large-scale fraud. But, concerned that his life might be in danger, he later
effectively gave himself up by travelling to the US, from where he was
extradited back to Greece in 1991.
Mr Eugene Mastrangelo, managing director of the Pinkerton's Risk Assessment
Services in the US, says the Bank of Crete story may contain lessons for Mr
Nadir. 'If I was him, my least concern would be the authorities. I would
worry more about the individuals who had staked me out.'
He says Mr Nadir would probably be safer if he went underground in the
Lebanon. 'There, he'd slip off the screen - and he could do whatever he's
got to do to correct his personal situation.'

FT  22 MAY 93 / Letter: Lavishness of dinner in eye of the beholder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID IVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your reporter David Owen writes of a 'lavish dinner' to mark the
chancellor's 21st anniversary as member of parliament for
Kingston-upon-Thames ('Knives out for Lamont again', May 15).
As somebody who was also there I can confirm that it was a very pleasant and
convivial occasion, but 'lavish dinner'? - it depends on one's standards.
David Owen also refers to 'days when Conservative governments used sometimes
to win mid-term by-elections'. In fact, Norman Lamont won the Kingston
by-election in May 1972 with a negligible swing against a Conservative
government nearly two years into office. This was attributable to his
impressive qualities as a candidate, the legacy of the retiring member John
Boyd-Carpenter, and an efficient Conservative organisation with more than
6,000 members.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Letter: Economic success at right social cost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NORMAN WILLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I heartily endorse your view that 'high and rising unemployment is now
the biggest problem facing all European governments, and their most urgent
need is growth and job creation' ('Get Europe to work,' May 19), but would
disagree equally strongly with your conclusion that this does not allow for
measures of social protection.
The real challenge for Europe is how to combine high levels of employment,
economic success and high social standards. Popular political pressures make
it impossible for Europe to seek to match the wage costs of its competitors
in Asia and elsewhere by driving down living standards.
The realistic course open to us is one based on high quality 'value-added'
production, improved training, better use of resources and maximising our
creative skills. But the support of Europe's working people for change
depends on us having a solid base of social protection and a genuine
all-Europe co-operative growth strategy. We won modest gains on this at the
Edinburgh Summit, and have had very positive and practical discussions with
the Danish government and the European Commission.
This could set the country on a new and popular course. If it does, I am
sure nobody will attack Jacques Delors for 'coming over and interfering with
our unemployment'.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Re your your editorial 'Cable telecoms' (May 19) I was left wondering
whether all you were suggesting was that one of the government's proposals
in the duopoly review be brought forward by 10 1/2 months. The March 1991
white paper stated that 'the government intends. . .from April 1 1994 to
allow the national PTOs (public telecommunications operators) to tender in
their own right for a local delivery service licence for any part of the
country not at that time covered by a cable or local delivery licence. Any
such application would fall to be considered under the normal ITC procedures
as specified at that time. . .'

FT  22 MAY 93 / Letter: Dissatisfied with BR's reaction to complaint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN PARKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The contents of the article 'Citizen's Charter cuts BR payouts' (May
17) did not surprise me. I took a journey by train from Euston to Chester,
via Crewe, in September last year. The InterCity was late, the connection
was not held despite being shown in the InterCity timetable and I, with
about six others, was left stranded.
The station manager had no authority to do other than (very politely)
explain the BR structure and authority levels, to advise who we could
complain to, and when the next train left for Chester. A further hour's
delay would have invalidated my appointment and so I took a taxi.
I wrote to Chris Green, managing director of InterCity, and was rapidly
passed down to a customer relations officer in Birmingham who quoted
internal procedures and regulations to me to prove that he could only take
responsibility for the InterCity delay. I guess that if you chop your
organisation into enough bits and force your customer to deal with each, he
gets fed up and goes away. I did and have not travelled by rail since.
BR's best solution would have been to give the station staff at Crewe the
authority to put us into a taxi, with profuse apologies. The next best would
have been for Mr Green to apologise and offer some compensation which had a
greater value to me than cost to BR - upgrade to first class on my next
journey or provide a discount voucher.
The worst was the course of action BR took, which demonstrated that top
management delegates customer service and satisfaction as low down the
organisation as possible. When I phoned the clerk concerned he was surprised
I could contact him and then quoted more regulations at me. As your article
on on Charterline confirms (Management: 'Manning the hot lines', May 19),
dissatisfied clients tell many friends and are very costly.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Life after Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS HAS been a historic week for the European Community. For almost five
years - to be precise, ever since the Hanover summit of EC heads of
government in June 1988 - debate about economic and monetary union has been
all-consuming. This week, which saw both the Danish vote in favour of the
Maastricht treaty and the successful third reading of the ratification bill
in the House of Commons, should mark the end of that long and painful
debate. The treaty should be ratified. But this will not end the
controversy. It will not even be the beginning of the end. It will just be
the end of the beginning.
Deciding the form of the treaty was the first stage. Ratifying it was a
second, still more contentious, one. But implementing it in current economic
circumstances will be most difficult of all. What is the EC to do with a
solemn treaty that has been ratified, but in some respects cannot be
implemented?
While the policy-makers grapple with these dilemmas, markets have decided
that, Emu or no, exchange rate stability is back, at least for a select
group of hard currency countries.
For this group, the decline in interest rate differentials vis-a-vis the
D-Mark has been nothing short of remarkable. Since the beginning of this
year, interest rate differentials on three-month money have fallen from more
than 14 percentage points to 0.85 percentage points for the Danish krone,
from 24 percentage points to 0.1 percentage points for the Irish punt and
from 5.1 percentage points to 0.1 percentage points for the French franc.
On the Dutch guilder, the comparable interest rate has been consistently
below that on the D-Mark, most recently by half a percentage point. But the
Belgian franc has joined the guilder, with a decline in the differential
from a percentage point in February, to minus 0.3 points.
Long-term bonds
More important as an indicator of long-term expectations are differentials
in yields on long-term bonds vis a vis the D-Mark. For the Irish punt, these
have tumbled from 3.1 points in January to 0.9 points; for the Danish krone,
from 2.4 percentage points last September to 0.6; for the Belgian franc,
from 1.2 points last September to 0.6; for the French franc, from 1.4
percentage points last October to 0.3; and for the Dutch guilder, from 0.5
points last September to -0.2 points.
Markets have already decided that these currencies are in the inner core of
the exchange rate mechanism. By contrast, the Italian lira, with a bond
yield differential of 5 1/2 percentage points, and the Spanish peseta, with
one of 4 points, are judged to offer an altogether different class of risk.
But sterling, with a bond yield differential of 1 percentage point, is
another matter again.
The increased chance of reaching monetary union is far from being the sole
reason for the markets' greater confidence in long-term currency stability.
The recently narrowing - and by now decidedly small - interest rate
differentials for the Danish krone, with its opt out, show that.
Germany's position
Investors have probably concluded that Germany is simply in the same leaky
economic boat as other core members of the ERM. Unification has swept away
its fiscal stability and the historic strength of the German current
account; inflation is now well entrenched; and the all-German unemployment
rate is the highest in the EC. Nor are there merely these structural
similarities. The cyclical position is also now fully comparable.
It is at least a reasonable assumption that the Bundesbank will be driven,
willy nilly, towards a monetary policy suitable for all the core countries.
There is also little reason to expect the D-Mark to remain a particularly
strong currency, even by European standards. Globally, things look worse
still. The D-Mark hit an all-time low against the Japanese yen this week.
Interest rate differentials suggest it is set to lose still more of its
value against both the yen and the dollar.
So is Emu, albeit a distant prospect, also increasingly an irrelevant one?
Will it be possible for currencies in the ERM core to sustain stability on
the basis of fundamental convergence, rather than hopes for a rapid march to
Emu? It is quite conceivable that this will happen, but investors may be too
optimistic in assuming that this is almost certain. The question is whether
the electorates of these countries will all be equally tolerant of policies
that generate slow growth and high unemployment. In practice, enduring
confidence in exchange rate stability depends on the emergence of policies
that generate recovery now and lower unemployment in the longer term.
Ratification of Maastricht was necessary. But the next five years must not
be as dominated by the provisions of that treaty as the last five have been
dominated by debates about it. The European Commission has at last
recognised that the EC has severe cyclical and structural economic problems.
Monetary and economic policies are needed to deal with these. The search
should start now.

FT  22 MAY 93 / The town without pity: Congressional setbacks and a drumbeat
of media criticism have made Bill Clinton appear vulnerable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is the Washington political establishment seriously down on Bill Clinton or,
in its own way, merely testing him? If the former, are his current troubles
comparable to those that eventually paralysed Jimmy Carter and,
domestically, George Bush? If the latter, does he have the stuff to pass the
exam?
The questions have to be recognised because Washington, where comment is the
staff of life, is asking them insistently. The rest of the country seems
more patient with the new president but it is still plugged in to what comes
out of the capital. It is possible to win the White House by running against
Washington, as Messrs Carter, Reagan and Clinton demonstrated, and even
easier to acquire popular cult status by keeping up the drumbeat of
criticism, which is Ross Perot's modus operandi. But once installed, a
president has got to come to terms with his new neighbours. He may seduce
them, cow them, deal with them or even go over their heads - avoid them he
cannot.
The establishment itself is both easy and hard to define. Its clear
component parts are the politicians, the media and the special interest
lobbies. But all eat and drink from the central trough, which is the
president and his government, and all have radically or subtly different
agendas.
At present there is no denying their collective appetite for Mr Clinton's
flesh. The issues may be Bosnia, deficit reduction, still unannounced
healthcare reform, gays in the military, campaign financing, federal land
use, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and more; and they are drawing
blood. For the first time, there has been a touch of petulance in the
president's responses and an acceptance, in the recent White House staff
reshuffle, that some of the criticisms had merit.
It was no coincidence that the president chose to take his economic message,
campaign-style, on the road for several days. It was equally predictable
that he was promptly criticised for leaving the superheated Washington
kitchen, just as he had been previously attacked for not getting out and
about enough.
Even commentators sympathetic to Mr Clinton have taken on a harder edge. Joe
Klein of Newsweek, condemning his 'marshmallowly all-inclusive empathy',
wrote: 'He has neutered the eternal political question - what's he for? -
and raised a darker, more perverse, test of his leadership - what, if
anything, is he against?' David Gergen of US News wrote: 'Friend and foe
alike think he can be rolled. . . . He has a wonderful head and a big heart,
but people are looking for more backbone.'
This is most evident in Mr Clinton's relations with Congress, where
politicians, more than ever, can no longer be defined simply by their party
allegiance. The Republicans may have held together to block the economic
stimulus package but desertions from Senator Bob Dole's fold enabled easier
voter registration (the 'motor voter' bill) to pass and may allow campaign
finance reform to get through. Some Republicans are nervous about being
blamed for 'gridlock'.
However, the adjustment after 12 years to a Democrat in the White House is
proving harder for the president's own party. Their universal public
catechism is that they want him to succeed, not least because if he fails
they may go down too, but many have difficulty separating the general wood
from their own favourite trees. In the House this week teeth have been bared
by a group of fiscal conservatives led by Congressmen Charles Stenholm of
Texas and Tim Penny of Minnesota, now strengthened by Congressman Dave
McCurdy of Oklahoma, a bosom friend of Mr Clinton until he was not rewarded
with either the Defense Department or the CIA. Their beef is that the
president's deficit reduction plan relies too much on revenue raising and
not enough on spending cuts.
Tom Foley, the speaker of the House, nursing a comfortable Democratic
majority, can probably contain their opposition by cracking the whip. Mr
Clinton helped by going to Capitol Hill this week. But the more
independent-minded Senate is a tougher nut to crack, as witnessed on
Thursday when David Boren, the Democrat from the oil state of Oklahoma and a
key member of the finance committee that has a Democratic majority of only
11 to nine, joined John Danforth, the Missouri Republican, in proposing
deeper spending cuts and fewer new taxes, including abandoning the BTU-based
energy tax. Their plan probably cannot pass the Senate but their opposition
makes more problematic and protracted the enactment of Mr Clinton's version
of the package in most of its proposed form.
The proliferation of special Democratic causes is also now pressing Mr
Clinton. Senator Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, a wily operator in defence
of his state's oil and gas interests, will ride his other hobby horse, a
value-added tax, for all it is worth, including siding with Messrs Boren and
Danforth. Congressman Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Senator Max Baucus of
Montana have laid down clear markers on Nafta passage, as has Senator George
Mitchell, the majority leader, on renewing China's most-favoured-nation
trading status. Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, who chairs the important House
ways and means committee, was more direct in simply eliminating the
investment tax credit from the president's agenda (with no complaints from
Mr Clinton because the committee approved a revenue bill broadly to his
liking).
Cross-party and regional coalitions are now a constant possibility, beyond
the farm and oil-state assault on the energy tax. Westerners combined to
frustrate Mr Clinton's plans to increase revenues from federal lands;
high-tech states such as Texas want to preserve multi-billion-dollar
prestige projects such as the super collider (a giant atom smasher) and the
space station.
None of this is new to Washington, though it now assumes particular
intensity. Congress is also set in some of its other ways, seemingly
oblivious to last year's electoral mandate for change. For example, much of
the blame for the slowness in administration appointments does lie with the
White House's relentless pursuit of diversity - but not all of it. The
Senate was not shown in its best light this week when a routine session to
confirm 16 nominees was endlessly delayed by special pleadings for potato
farmers in Maine, a commuter trunk road in St Louis, and changes in the
Treasury's family income statistics. Only half the nominees got the nod and
the perception of business as usual, now captured by live cable television
coverage, was reinforced.
If the body politic is fretting, the media is even more fractious. Instant
punditry is now the norm, no longer confined to the established columnists
or notorious talk show hosts who became celebrities last year because the
candidates all wanted to appear on their programmes. Every action by the
president is deemed worthy of an absolute life-or-death verdict, as in some
Roman amphitheatre. The sense of government and politics as a process is
getting lost.
Mr Clinton shares some blame for this phenomenon, because his chronic
activism invites so many judgments. Also, unlike Presidents Reagan and Bush,
both often inarticulate unless speaking from a script, his natural tendency,
now slightly curbed, is to talk knowledgeably all around any given subject.
This still delights many - Chris Patten, the governor of Hong Kong, was
quite bowled over by his recent Oval Office session - but it also may
confuse the public as much as it enlightens.
The Bosnian petard has been particularly illustrative. Having tried, like
the grand old Duke of York, to march the American people and the allies up
the hill of forceful intervention, his retreat, even if understandable,
reinforces an impression of indecision. A common complaint, from press and
politicians alike, is that support would be there if only the president
explained what he was going to do and why. Some red-blooded pundits apart,
this would probably extend to doing relatively little in the Balkans,
barring some new wave of atrocities or threats to other countries.
However, some of the media assaults seem less well-founded. This week's
controversies over the sacking of the White House travel staff for
non-competitive practices and sloppy bookkeeping and the circumstances of Mr
Clinton's haircut on board Air Force One at Los Angeles Airport do not
suggest a willingness to give the president a fair shake. But they do
increase the perception that he is vulnerable.
Explanations include a media sense that he got too easy a ride at the end
(not the beginning) of last year's campaign; the media's piqued relations
with the very young and workaholic White House staff; and a punchier and
more herd-like brand of contemporary political journalism, which is now more
of a blood sport and less of a contemplative occupation.
In a sense, Mr Clinton's good start - the first budget bill passed, Boris
Yeltsin succoured, fine speeches given - set him up for a fall, which the
Washington establishment always enjoys facilitating. Even the capital's new
star, Janet Reno, the attorney-general, is feeling this phenomenon. Having
risen to staggering heights of popularity by the mere, but abnormal, act of
'taking responsibility' for the Waco denouement, she is now under fire for
protecting those who gave her bad advice. 'Only in Washington,' said a tart
column in the iconoclastic New Republic, 'would this make her a hero.'
Observing the political and media fray is Washington's largest
private-sector industry - the special interest lobbyists. They are vultures
in the populist eye of Ross Perot and a target of Mr Clinton, who wants to
take away some of their tax deductions. While it is far too facile to place
all lobbyists in the hall of reactionary shame normally reserved for the
National Rifle Association, it is dangerous to ignore their power. Their
influence in Oklahoma on Senator Boren was palpable.
One such clash of the lobbying titans already endangers healthcare reform
even before its unveiling. Abortion rights advocates are demanding that
national health insurance cover be provided to all reproductive services
while the right-to-life forces are threatening to scuttle the whole package
if a single cent is spent to reimburse abortions. Totally lost in the
passionate wash is the reality that only a minute share of national
healthcare costs, which everybody accept must be curtailed, are accounted
for by abortions.
It has always been said of Mr Clinton that he is a fast learner. It was true
in last year's campaign and was certainly the case over 12 years as governor
of Arkansas, especially after a hyperactive first term ended in defeat. But
the campaign and Little Rock were the minor leagues. In Washington, he is
seriously expected to be the boss, using whatever tactics work, and the
first year is when that essence of leadership needs to be shown. In short,
he needs to win 'a big one' - and soon.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Tendering change planned to facilitate cost savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is considering proposals to change the rules on competitive
tendering after a warning from contractors that confusion over the rights of
employees is reducing the scope for cost saving through market testing and
contracting out.
The proposals, which include increasing the length of public sector
contracts, have been drawn up by the Cleaning and Support Services
Association, which represents public sector contractors.
In a recent letter to the prime minister the association says that the
Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981, known
as Tupe, have made it 'very difficult' for contractors to bid for public
sector work.
Where the Tupe regulations apply a contractor must take over the existing
workforce at their current terms and conditions. This makes it hard to
reduce labour costs, often the main source of cost savings for contractors.
The prime minister has asked government departments for information about
how the Tupe regulations are affecting market testing and contracting out
and has promised a co-ordinated reply.
The association says that if the Tupe regulations apply it is hard for the
contractor to achieve cost savings in the three years which contracts
commonly last. It argues that longer contracts would allow labour costs to
be gradually reduced through natural wastage or negotiated reorganisation.
The association says: 'The longer the contract term the greater the
opportunity there is for a more competitive approach.'
The association recommends a minimum of five years for contracts, with an
option to extend them for a further two years before re-tendering.
Other proposals from the association include amendments to the Tupe
regulations to make it easier for contractors to reorganise their
workforces.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Lending up sharply but money growth sluggish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LENDING BY banks and building societies to the private and corporate sectors
rose sharply last month, but the underlying growth of broad money was
sluggish, pointing to low levels of inflation for some time.
Bank of England figures showed that bank and building society lending, known
as M4 lending, rose by Pounds 2.9bn last month after falling Pounds 1.3bn in
March as the private and corporate sectors continued to repay debt. M4
lending has been erratic in the past few months.
Economists said much of the the sharp rise in April represented a bounce
back from the March figure.
Broad money - notes and coins in circulation plus bank and building society
deposits - grew a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent on the previous month to
give a year-on-year growth rate of 3.5 per cent, slightly weaker than
expected.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said: 'The
underlying trend in broad money growth is consistent with at best a very
modest economic recovery.'
The 3.5 per cent increase in provisional M4 was at the bottom of the
Treasury's 3 per cent to 9 per cent monitoring range set in the March
Budget.
Data from the British Bankers Association showed that sterling lending by
the nine big high-street banking groups to the private sector (about 70 per
cent of total bank lending) rose almost Pounds 2.5bn in April. This compared
with a revised fall of Pounds 1bn in March.
The association said a similar pattern occurred last year with a big fall in
March followed by a larger rise in April. It said the most likely
explanation was the exceptional size of the public sector borrowing
requirement in March of both years which allowed the temporary repayment of
bank borrowing by companies.
A better idea of the trend is given by averaging out the March and April
figures. The result, monthly growth of Pounds 733m, is only slightly higher
than the trend figure for the previous three months.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Building society inflow up to Pounds 1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING SOCIETIES had a net inflow of deposits from savers of Pounds 1.07bn
in April compared with Pounds 249m in March, enjoying their best month for
two years.
The last time building societies had a comparable monthly inflow was April
1991, when net receipts totalled Pounds 1.3bn. Net inflow was Pounds 820m
for the whole of the previous three months.
Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the Building Societies Association, said
the rise represented 'a significant departure from the modest inflows
experienced over recent months'.
He attributed the increase to 'the specific marketing efforts of individual
societies and seasonal factors rather than a general trend. As such the
inflow of savings may well fall back next month'.
Mr Nigel Richardson of Yamaichi Securities said the figures indicated that
people were saving more of their discretionary income, which had been rising
as a result of the fall in mortgage rates.
Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Greenwell Montagu, said: 'Building
societies will find it more difficult to whinge against National Savings as
a result of these figures.'
The increase in mortgage activity recorded in March was sustained in the
April building society figures. Gross mortgage lending was Pounds 2.71bn in
April, up fractionally from March.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Computer hackers jailed for 6 months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO COMPUTER hackers who broke into systems belonging to companies and
institutions around the world were imprisoned for six months yesterday, John
Mason writes.
Mr Neil Woods and Mr Karl Strickland had earlier pleaded guilty to offences
under the Computer Misuse Act - legislation introduced in 1990 to outlaw
computer hacking.
For two years the two men hacked into computers belonging to the investment
bank SG Warburg, British Telecommunications, the European Community and
Nasa, the US space agency.
The court heard that the cost of the damage they caused was conservatively
estimated at more than Pounds 123,000.
Passing sentence on the men at Southwark Crown Court in London Judge Michael
Harris said he fully accepted that their hacking activities were not
designed to damage systems, to misuse the information they contained or to
make a profit from what they were doing.
He told them custodial sentences were appropriate, however, 'to penalise you
for what you have done and for the losses caused and to deter others who
might be similarly tempted'.
Mr Strickland, a Liverpool University research assistant, and Mr Woods, a
computer salesman from Oldham, Greater Manchester, both pleaded guilty to
conspiring to obtain telegraphic services dishonestly and to engaging in the
unauthorised publication of computer information.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Smith warns Major over 'a privatisation too far'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday called on the government to bow
to public opinion and drop its 'crazy' proposals for privatising British
Rail, the Post Office and British Coal.
He accused Mr John Major, the prime minister, of acting like a 'runaway
train' by ignoring the verdict of the voters in recent elections that they
were opposed to any further privatisations. Mr Smith warned the prime
minister that if he refused to listen to the British people 'privatisation
will be his Waterloo'.
Mr Smith, in a speech to the Welsh Labour party conference at Llandudno,
ridiculed the performance of Group 4, the security company, in escorting
prisoners to the courts - 'the privatisation scheme that allowed
enterprising prisoners to privatise themselves'.
Instead of learning the lesson of what was 'a privatisation too far', he
said, the prime minister was taking this 'ideological claptrap' into areas
which even his predecessor, Baroness Thatcher, had realised were beyond the
pale.
Mr Smith also scoffed at Mr Major's appeal for a climate of partnership
between government and industry, made earlier in the week at the
Confederation of British Industry's annual dinner.
The Tories had 14 years in which to build such a partnership, Mr Smith said,
so why should anyone believe they were serious about it now?
Mr Smith underlined the role played by Mr Major as chief secretary to the
Treasury, chancellor and prime minister in the conduct of policy which
produced a Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement and threats to the welfare
state. He said that the prime minister, having broken his pledges on tax,
now seemed set on tearing up his promises not to cut public expenditure.
Mr Smith accused the government of shaming the nation with its strategy of
trying to boost inward investment by selling Britain as a low-skill, low-pay
economy. The strategy was doomed because there would always be countries
which would do the work more cheaply, pay their people less and exploit them
even more.
Dealing with his proposals to improve the Labour party's internal democracy,
Mr Smith denied that they involved breaking the links with the unions. Under
existing arrangements political levy-paying union members already made a
voluntary contribution to the party and they would be encouraged to play a
full role at constituency level by paying a special membership rate.
Mr Smith said: 'It is a twin-track strategy - one member, one vote, but also
many more members, many more votes.'

FT  22 MAY 93 / Proposal to help property recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS have been asked to adopt an innovative approach to dealing with
their problem property loans by selling the underlying assets to a jointly
owned company, Vanessa Houlder writes.
The suggestion, by Mr Ken Caesar, a partner of Richard Ellis Chartered
Surveyors and Mr Colin Bird, a partner of Price Waterhouse, is designed to
improve the prospects of a recovery in the property market by reducing the
overhang of property for sale.
They said the company, which would own Pounds 1bn to 2bn of property, would
require the injection of several hundreds of millions of pounds of equity to
gain approval from the Bank of England. The company could be sold or floated
after several years. Several bankers dismissed the idea as unrealistic
because of likely difficulties in raising outside equity and reaching
agreement among themselves.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Paisley's party and Sinn Fein make gains in Ulster poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXPECTATIONS OF an early resumption of the round-table talks on Northern
Ireland appeared to fade last night as the final results for the province's
local elections showed that Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist party,
which is led by the Rev Ian Paisley, had reversed their electoral decline.
In Belfast Sinn Fein emerged with 23.2 per cent, the biggest share of the
vote for any party, outpolling even the Ulster Unionist party.
Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said the result 'has dramatically
renovated Sinn Fein's mandate'.
Across the province the Sinn Fein vote increased by 1.5 percentage points to
12.5 per cent, winning it 51 council seats out of the 582 total.
The Ulster Unionist party, the largest party in Northern Ireland, saw its
support slip by 5 points to 29 per cent, although it increased the number of
seats it holds from 193 to 197.
Mr Herbert Ditty, the hard-line unionist Lord Mayor of Belfast, lost his
seat to Mr Chris McGimpsey, an independent unionist, but control of the
council remains in Unionist hands by a slim majority.
Mr Ken Maginnis, deputy leader of the UUP, lost his seat in Dungannon, while
the nationalist SDLP consolidated its hold on Derry council, winning an
absolute majority of 17 seats.
The turnout across the province was 55 per cent. The overall nationalist
vote apparently rose as Unionist participation fell. The main loser has been
the Conservative party, which saw most of the gains it made in the 1989
local elections wiped out.
The Conservatives won only six seats, against more than 10 last time, with
support apparently drifting back to the centrist Alliance party.
The Alliance vote increased by 1 point to 7.7 per cent, but its support
appears increasingly concentrated in the middle-class areas of the east and
south-east of the province.
Mr Brian Feeney, a spokesman for the SDLP, said the vote for the political
extremes had hardened in those areas which had suffered the most political
violence over the past year, while the vote for the more moderate SDLP, UUP
and Alliance parties had held up or improved where there was greater
stability.
He said the Belfast result 'will have knocked a lot of people back on their
heels'.
Mr Addie Morrow, until recently the chairman of the Alliance party, said: 'I
believe the result is very bad for the future of Northern Ireland. The
electorate has given no encouragement for the parties to get together and
negotiate.'
Mr Richard McCaulay, the spokesman for Sinn Fein, whose party has been
excluded from talks because of its support for the IRA, said future
political talks 'are almost certain to fail unless a process is developed
which excludes no-one'.
The DUP described its result as 'a left hook' to efforts by Sir Patrick
Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, to get talks going again.
Mr Peter Robinson, the DUP deputy leader, said: 'If Sir Patrick Mayhew
cannot read the message of this election then he needs glasses.' The DUP 'is
not interested in the talks on the basis of the blueprint that (Sir Patrick)
has offered'.
Results: UUP 197 seats; DUP 103; SDLP 127; Sinn Fein 51; Alliance 44;
Conservatives 6; Independents 51.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Scrapping poll tax helps curb inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUT-PRICE lettuces, apples and cauliflowers and a shift in local taxation
were behind the big fall in inflation announced yesterday.
Many types of seasonal foods are much cheaper than a year ago because of
bumper harvests around the world. The move from the poll tax to the council
tax last month had a big impact in forcing down the inflation rate. Higher
central government grants mean the average household is paying 8.7 per cent
less under the new system.
The retail prices index for last month came to 140.6, up 0.9 per cent from
the 139.3 registered in March.
The index is worked out on the basis that in January 1987 it was 100.
In the year to last month the RPI rose by just 1.3 per cent, after a
year-on-year increase of 1.9 per cent in March, for an overall fall of 0.6
percentage points in the inflation rate.
The impact of the switch in taxation took 0.7 percentage points off this
rate between March and April.
Rising prices - albeit of a moderate degree - for other types of goods and
services were responsible for pushing up the rate by a meagre 0.1 of a
percentage point.
Between March and last month seasonal foods fell in price by 2.8 per cent,
the biggest April decrease for these items since the Central Statistical
Office started records in 1956.
Seasonal foods - one of the 15 main categories of goods and services forming
the basis for the RPI - last month cost 7.7 per cent less than in April last
year after a year-on-year fall of 6.8 per cent in March.
Fresh fruit was sold last month for 17 per cent less than a year previously
while prices of vegetables were down 2 per cent.
Shoppers also found fresh fish at bargain prices, down 10 per cent from the
corresponding month last year.
Potatoes were down 4 per cent in price, but lamb and cheese cost 12 per cent
and 10 per cent more respectively. Non-seasonal foods as a whole cost 3 per
cent more last month than a year previously.
Of all 15 categories in the RPI only six experienced an increase between
March and April in the year-on-year rate of price changes. Housing costs -
in which local taxation is a key component - were down 6.9 per cent in the
12 months to April after a 3.6 per cent fall in the year to March.
The average housebuyer has seen mortgage interest payments fall by 23 per
cent in the year to last month, reflecting lower interest rates.
Household fuel and light bills fell 0.6 per cent between April last year and
last month, while leisure goods were up in price by only a muted 1.7 per
cent.
Cigarettes and tobacco showed price increases of 7 per cent over this period
while canteen meals were up 8 per cent.
Furniture has risen in price by only 2 per cent over the past year and
electrical appliances have not increased.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Computer hackers jailed for 6 months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO COMPUTER hackers who broke into systems belonging to companies and
institutions around the world were imprisoned for six months yesterday.
Mr Neil Woods and Mr Karl Strickland had earlier pleaded guilty to offences
under the Computer Misuse Act - legislation introduced in 1990 to outlaw
computer hacking.
For two years the two men hacked into computers belonging to the investment
bank SG Warburg, British Telecommunications, the European Community, and
Nasa, the US space agency. The court heard that the cost of the damage they
caused was conservatively estimated at more than Pounds 123,000.
Passing sentence on the men at Southwark Crown Court in London, Judge
Michael Harris said he fully accepted that their hacking activities were not
designed to damage systems, to misuse the information they contained, or to
make a profit from what they were doing.
He told them, however, custodial sentences were appropriate 'to penalise you
for what you have done and for the losses caused, and to deter others who
might be similarly tempted'.
He said hacking was not harmless and hackers needed to be given a clear
signal that their activities would not be tolerated.
Mr Strickland, a Liverpool University research assistant, and Mr Woods, a
computer salesman from Oldham, both pleaded guilty to conspiring to obtain
telegraphic services dishonestly, and engaging in the unauthorised
publication of computer information.
Mr Woods also admitted causing Pounds 15,000 damage to a computer owned by
Central London Polytechnic.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Building society inflow up to Pounds 1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING SOCIETIES had a net inflow of deposits from savers of Pounds 1.07bn
in April compared with Pounds 249m in March, enjoying their best month for
two years.
Net inflow was Pounds 820m for the whole of the previous three months. The
last time building societies had a comparable monthly inflow was April 1991,
when net recipts totalled Pounds 1.3bn.
Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the Building Societies Association, said
the rise 'represents a significant departure from the modest inflows
experienced over recent months'.
He attributed the increase to 'the specific marketing efforts of individual
societies and seasonal factors rather than a general trend. As such the
inflow of savings may well fall back next month'.
Mr Nigel Richardson of Yamaichi Securities said the figures indicated that
people were saving more of their discretionary income, which had been rising
as a result of the fall in mortgage rates.
Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Greenwell Montagu, said: 'Building
societies will find it more difficult to whinge against National Savings as
a result of these figures. They discount fears of mortgage rate rises.'
National Savings contributed Pounds 249m to government funding in April, and
most of this - Pounds 162m - came from accrued interest.
Last year building societies claimed unfair competition by National Savings.
Its First Option Bond raised Pounds 800m in four months and Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester building society raised its mortgage rates as a result.
The increase in mortgage activity recorded in March was sustained in the
April building society figures. Gross mortgage lending was Pounds 2.71bn in
April, up fractionally from March. Net new commitments increased to Pounds
3.18bn, up from Pounds 3.09bn in March. Voluntary company liquidations in
England and Wales rose to 3,454 in the first quarter of the year compared
with 3,416 in the same period last year, KMPG Peat Marwick said.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Way opened for BR bill changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday rejected calls from a Commons select committee for
changes to its rail privatisation plans. It appeared to leave open the
possibility of last-minute amendments to the Railways Bill, to be debated in
the Commons next week.
The cross-party transport committee last month published the results of a
four-month investigation into the government's plans and called for a series
of changes, warning that privatisation could otherwise go badly wrong.
Several of its criticisms focused on the idea of open access to the tracks
for competing passenger-train operators and the separation of ownership of
the tracks and trains. The committee also warned that budgetary constraints
could lead to line closures.
The government response rejects fundamental changes to the structure of
privatisation. It says: 'As the report itself recognises, the grain of
current trends in Europe and elsewhere is away from unitary railway
undertakings and towards greater freedom of access.'
The government also says, however, that it has been considering the issues
addressed by the report and will continue to do so as the Railways Bill
passes through parliament.
This statement may give encouragement to rebel Conservative backbenchers
seeking changes to the Railways Bill at report stage in the Commons on
Monday and Tuesday.
The rebels want clauses added to the bill which would preserve discounted
railcard schemes and give British Rail the right to bid for franchises.
Train passengers have registered a large vote of no-confidence in the
privatisation plans, a survey shows. Some 71 per cent of people interviewed
at mainline stations said they were opposed to the plans, according to a
Gallup survey in today's Daily Telegraph. Gallup interviewed 575 passengers.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Deception causes Sumitomo loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUMITOMO Finance International, the London-based arm of the Sumitomo Bank,
suffered losses of Dollars 2m to Dollars 3m on its interest rate options
book last autumn after an employee concealed his true trading position from
senior management.
The losses were linked to the partial breakdown of the European exchange
rate mechanism, which overturned the assumptions about volatility and market
correlation on which options prices are based, making the market extremely
difficult to trade.
A number of houses suffered losses. But at Sumitomo Finance, the manager of
the interest rate options desk falsified prices in order to foil the
management's control procedures. Unchecked, the losses mushroomed.
The full affair came to light yesterday, when the Securities and Futures
Authority, the UK regulator, expelled Mr Zahid Mannan, the manager in
question, from its registers. This in effect bars him for life from the
business in the UK. There was no suggestion that Mr Mannan was seeking to
profit personally.
Mr Mannan was also fined Pounds 10,000 and ordered to make a contribution of
Pounds 4,000 towards the SFA's investigation costs.
As manager of the interest rate options desk Mr Mannan had to record the
value of his positions in management reports submitted to his chief
executive.
He gave falsely inflated values in order to hide his true position. Mr
Mannan then persuaded an employee with another firm, which he knew was used
by Sumitomo's accounts department to check those valuations, to quote
inflated prices that corresponded with those in his own internal management
reports.
This arrangement was brought to light while Mr Mannan was on holiday and the
subsequent investigation showed that his actions had resulted in Sumitomo's
qualifying capital being overstated in the preceding months, the SFA said.
The amount of capital held by firms is adjusted according to their exposure.
Sumitomo Finance declined to comment.
Among a number of serious 'hits' as a result of options trading is
Allied-Lyons, the UK food and drinks group, which lost Pounds 150m in 1991
on foreign exchange positions taken without the knowledge of senior
management.
The Sumitomo losses, while much less severe, underline the problems involved
in managing the risk generated by derivatives business.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Broad Left wins in BT union poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING unrest over changes in working practices and job cuts at British
Telecommunications have led to an unexpectedly victory by the Broad Left in
this year's executive committee elections in the 125,000-strong National
Communications Union.
The success of the left may threaten the union's policy of co-operation with
BT over its plans to cut 15,000 jobs this year with a further 15,000 due to
go in 1994.
The election has left a group of leftwing Labour party members and members
of far left groups holding 20 of the 35 executive seats. The rightwing
Members First organisation suffered a loss of 10 seats, being reduced to
only three places with the clerical group holding the other 12 executive
places. One NCU official said the main reason for the sweeping victory by
the Broad Left was the threat of compulsory seven-day shift working and
extension of the existing working day under BT's customer improvement
programme.
Mr Tony Young, the NCU's moderate general secretary, said yesterday there
were 'no viable options' to the NCU's current strategy towards BT. He added
that any refusal by the union to work with BT would be 'unwise' and ensure
it exercised 'less influence' in the company.
The change in the executive's balance of power could also lead to a shift in
its policy to the rejection of one-member-one-vote for the selection of
Labour party parliamentary candidates. This would be a setback to the
chances of Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, winning a vote on the issue at
the autumn party conference.

MR RICHARD Needham, the trade minister, is to lead a delegation of 25
business executives on a five-day export promotion mission to the Far East
at the end of the month, Ivor Owen writes.
This was announced by Mr Edward Leigh, junior trade and industry minister,

efforts of British companies to maximise their share of the world's
fastest-growing market.
He said South Korea was among the 17 countries to which ministers would lead

Mr Leigh said British exports to China had doubled in the first two months
of this year, and Mr Needham, who had been there three times in the last
year, was planning an early return visit.
Mr Leigh said Britain's share of world trade had stabilised in volume terms
after three decades of decline.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Many London hospital services face axe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SERIES of reviews ordered by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, is
about to recommend widespread closures of specialist hospital services in
London.
The six reviews of the allocation of specialist services in London are also
about to propose several transfers of facilities to areas of population
growth outside the capital.
An unexpected consequence of the reviews, which came after the Tomlinson
report into London healthcare, is that they could undermine the financial
stability of successful hospitals identified for survival by Tomlinson.
St Mary's, Paddington - one of the capital's most financially viable
teaching hospitals - stands to lose 10 per cent of its annual income if the
government accepts a recommendation that its cardiac surgery and renal
transplant facilities close.
Mrs Bottomley will receive the final recommendations of the review teams -
which have examined the provision of cancer, renal, neurosciences, plastic
surgery and burns, cardiac and children's services - next week. But
confidential briefings of the review teams' overall thinking, given this
week to senior managers and medical school academics, indicate that there
will be radical restructuring of specialist services around fewer, bigger
units.
The inquiry concluded that the 14 inner London hospitals providing
specialist cardiac services should be reduced to five, with a new cardiac
centre located at Brighton. A similar reduction in neuroscience services is
proposed, with some of the capital's surplus specialist capacity
transferring to Guildford.
The survival chances of Charing Cross hospital, one of those threatened with
closure after the Tomlinson report, have risen as a result of the reviews,
which envisage retaining it as a specialist centre. Other inner London
teaching hospitals likely to emerge from the reviews with a strong range of
specialist services are the combined Guy's-St Thomas'; St George's; the
Royal London and University College.
The review teams are expected, however, to support the removal of specialist
services from St Bartholomew's hospital in the City, another of those
recommended for closure in the Tomlinson report. This would make it
increasingly probable that St Bartholomew's would be fully amalgamated with
the Royal London on the latter's East End site.
There is general acceptance that London's many scattered specialist services
need rationalisation, but some of the specific recommendations will cause
anger and alarm. Staff at St Mary's reacted with dismay yesterday to the
proposed loss of specialist activities.
The Tomlinson report concluded that St Mary's ranked 'fairly low' on a
vulnerability list of London hospitals and had a stable financial position.
But the review recommendations would lead to the loss of Pounds 10m from its
Pounds 100m annual income.
Lord Glenarthur, chairman of the St Mary's Trust, said: 'This hospital has
worked hard to become viable and is a good example of the fact that the NHS
reforms are working. But instead of rewarding success, we are apparently now
being told to try to walk on one leg.'

FT  22 MAY 93 / Hopes rise for launch of investment watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS for the creation of the Personal Investment Authority, the
proposed new self-regulatory body for financial services, have been boosted
by a compromise proposal on membership rules intended to encourage banks,
building societies and independent sales agents to join.
The proposal from Sir Brian Jenkins, a senior partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand,
the accountancy firm, and a former Lord Mayor of London, involves moderating
the controversial proposal by the Securities and Investments Board that
independent financial advisers be required to have minimum capital of Pounds
10,000.
Sir Brian has proposed that only those who, after submitting a three-year
business plan, cannot demonstrate solvency will have to present an
enforceable guarantee that up to Pounds 10,000 could be put into the
business.
The solvency test will also have to be met if their gross revenues fall by
25 per cent, or if a single source providing more than 10 per cent of their
business is lost.
Bankers, who had been particularly keen to see minimum capital rules,
privately said they did not believe the compromise would weaken regulatory
standards.
One bank official said: 'If this report is adopted in its present form it
will go a long way towards encouraging at least some of the big banks to
join the PIA.'
Both Barclays Bank and National Westminster Bank have said they would join
the PIA provided it raised regulatory standards along the lines suggested
last year by SIB chairman Mr Andrew Large.
The PIA had asked Sir Brian to review the SIB proposals, intended to make
the PIA a tougher regulator than the existing self-regulatory bodies.
The PIA is intended to replace Lautro, the self-regulatory body for life
insurers, and Fimbra, the body for independent financial advisers.
Life insurers have said they will not join unless the banks and building
societies which sell financial services join as well. Most of those are
regulated directly by SIB.
Sir Brian endorsed SIB's proposal that all those joining the PIA be vetted
before admission, even if they had previously been members in good standing
of a similar body.
He urged, however, that as far as possible, those vetting new members should
rely on information already on file at other self-regulatory bodies.
The proposals are also expected to be largely welcomed by large independent
financial adviser firms which already exceed the minimum requirements
spelled out in the paper.
Mr John Bridle, chief executive at Towry Law, a large chain of independent
financial advisers, said: 'One needs to do something so the industry as a
whole can demonstrate it is committed to raising standards.'

FT  22 MAY 93 / SFO seeks two men who fled with Nadir: Officials 'gnash
teeth at borders'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DETECTIVES FROM the Serious Fraud Office want to question two UK
businessmen, Mr Peter Dimond and Mr David Hamilton, who are living in
northern Cyprus after flying there with Mr Asil Nadir.
Mr Dimond, a former aircraft dealer, this week described how he helped Mr
Nadir jump his Pounds 3m bail by flying to Beauvais in France, where they
were met by a Cessna Citation jet which flew them to northern Cyprus.
Mr Hamilton has been identified as having at least a part interest in the
US-registered Cessna Citation. Mr Dimond and Mr Hamilton were on the plane
with Mr Nadir when it landed in Kyrenia on May 4.
Mr Michael Hamlin, owner of Hamlin Jets, which manages the Citation,
yesterday said Mr Hamilton had been a 'co-owner' of the plane for three
years. He confirmed Mr Hamilton had been on board.
He said that two other passengers, Mr Timothy Lambon, a Zimbabwean, and Mr
Anthony Sawyer had also been on board. The SFO also wants to question them.
Mr Hamlin said yesterday the jet had not flown directly to Beauvais, as
originally thought, but had spent a night in Dinard, France. He said he had
been unaware of the purpose of the flight.
Mr Dimond said in Cyprus yesterday he had no intention of returning to
England to face police questioning. 'If you were in my shoes would you go
back?' he said. 'The police can come here and question me here. There is
nothing to stop me talking to them. But they know they can do nothing.'
Asked about possible extradition, he said that so far the Turkish Cypriot
authorities had left him alone, adding he did not know the status of his
stay on the island.
Foreign Office officials indicated that efforts to secure Turkey's help in
having Mr Nadir and British citizens linked to his escape brought back to
the UK remained deadlocked.
The growing frustration felt by British officials was summed up by a senior
detective last night: 'We are sitting at the borders, champing and gnashing
our teeth, but there is very little we can do.'
Police hope Mr Dimond will eventually return to England voluntarily to
rejoin his wife and family in his Hampshire home. Under UK law anyone who
helps a financial fugitive to jump bail faces a potential prison term of
anything up to five years.

FT  22 MAY 93 / 420 jobs at Swan Hunter to go soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TOTAL of 420 of the 2,200 jobs at Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder,
will be lost next week, receivers Price Waterhouse said yesterday.
The cuts, described by union leaders as a devasting blow, are mainly among
steelworkers and technical staff. The 420 planned redundancies comprise 212
blue-collar workers, 134 white-collar workers and 74 short-term contract
workers.
Mr Ed James, one of the receivers, said the redundancies were necessary to
bring employment levels into balance with the company's workload, while
retaining technical expertise as the search continued for a buyer for the
business as a going concern.
Labour MP Mr Steve Byers, in whose Wallsend constituency the company is
headquartered, attacked the decision to shed jobs as premature.
Union leaders, who were told further jobs would be at risk in the near
future if Swans did not win an Oman order it has tendered for, expressed
concern that cutting 89 technical jobs, one third of the total, could
handicap attempts to clinch new contracts - a view rejected by Price
Waterhouse.
The job losses take effect next Friday, the last date the Ministry of
Defence has agreed for outfitting work to continue at Swans on three Type 23
frigates, its main workload. Finishing the vessels, providing work until
late 1994, offers Swans the best chance of finding a buyer as a going
concern. Talks between Price Waterhouse and the ministry are continuing.
Yesterday HMS Westminster left the Tyne for sea trials, postponed when Swans
went into receivership last Thursday after its failure to win a helicopter
carrier order. Price Waterhouse denied Mr Byers's claim that the Westminster
might not return to the Tyne next week for completion.
Mr Byers also said that the ministry on Thursday invited Vosper Thornycroft
of Southampton to submit a price for completing work on the frigates. The
ministry said it could not comment. Mr Martin Jay, Vosper's managing
director, said the ministry had issued no such statement. The company
refused to comment further.
Mr Jay said his company, which has a Pounds 700m order book reaching to
1997, had 'plenty of spare capacity'.
AV Seawork, a wholly owned Vosper subsidiary, advertised in Tyneside's
Evening Chronicle on Thursday for experienced ship design engineers.
Interviews will be held at a Wallsend hotel on Tuesday. Mr Jay said the
engineers were needed for the company's existing workload.
The Tyne and Wear Development Corporation announced yesterday it was
providing, with the Tyneside Training and Enterprise Council, up to Pounds
100,000 to study the merchant shipbuilding market and help Price Waterhouse
evaluate bids.
Tomorrow in Carlisle shop stewards from all UK shipyards will be asked to
back a motion urging workers at other yards to refuse to work on the
frigates.
Mr Mike Hubbold, outfitting trades secretary at VSEL in Barrow-in-Furness,
said unions there had taken no stance yet on what would happen should the
frigates be moved there.

FT  22 MAY 93 / BCCI auditor probe halted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HIGH COURT yesterday granted Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, the
chance to delay an investigation into its role as auditor to the collapsed
Bank of Credit and Commerce International by the profession's highest
disciplinary body, Andrew Jack writes.
Mr Justice Tuckey granted the firm leave for judicial review at a two-day
hearing in July to determine whether it could delay an inquiry by the Joint
Disciplinary Scheme of three of the UK's leading accountancy bodies.
The JDS maintains that it has a duty in the public interest to examine the
role of the firm in the circumstances surrounding the collapse of BCCI.
But Price Waterhouse said any proceedings from the inquiry would be subject
to discovery and could prejudice the outcome of writs against the firm by
the liquidators to BCCI for more than Dollars 8bn.
It also disclosed for the first time that the joint monitoring unit which
regulates auditors in chartered accountancy firms had inspected PW with an
extended remit to consider its role as auditor to BCCI. It has not had its
right to conduct bank audits rebuked as a result.

MR ASIL Nadir, the fugitive Cypriot businessman, has successfully intervened
in the Turkish courts to prevent the sale of Gunaydin, the Istanbul
newspaper, in his latest move to regain control of his Turkish assets.
On Thursday an Istanbul court postponed the sale by the official receivers

The former Polly Peck chairman, who jumped bail in the UK earlier this month

Gunaydin's staff, owed more than TL60bn by Mr Nadir, created a new company
called Yeni Gunaydin last year, printing on machinery auctioned by the state
receivers.
Imar bank, the newspaper's creditors, unsuccessfully challenged the move in
the courts.
This week Mr Osman Adas, acting for Mr Nadir, claimed the Gunaydin title was
vested in Veb Holding, a private company, which according to Turkish
Treasury records is 100 per cent owned by Mr Nadir.
Mr Nadir's action has blocked the sale of Gunaydin to Mr Mustafa Suzer, a
businessman of Kurdish origin and owner of the Pera Palas Hotel,
immortalised by the writer Agatha Christie.

FT  22 MAY 93 / National Mutual offshoot is fined Pounds 45,000 by Lautro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NM FINANCIAL Management, the UK life insurance division of Australia-based
National Mutual, has been fined Pounds 45,000 by regulators for failing to
vet its sales staff properly and for failing to insure that 'best advice'
was given to clients.
NMFM will also have to pay the costs of the investigation and pay
compensation to investors who have been sold unsuitable products.
Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, said
yesterday that its compliance staff initially uncovered deficiencies in
NMFM's procedures for vetting sales staff during a visit in December 1990.
In May last year Lautro conducted a further visit and found there were still
deficiencies and that moreover, there was insufficient information in
company files for regulators to see whether best advice had been given.
Under Lautro rules sales agents must conduct a 'fact-find' on each
prospective customer to discover his financial position, needs and goals.
Without this information sales agents cannot properly advise a client about
the product most appropriate to his needs.
This may lead to mis-selling of unsuitable products which are likely to be
cancelled by clients in the first few years, leading to a loss of most of
the premiums paid.
NMFM said that since that visit it had improved its vetting procedures and
had reviewed policies sold to customers where insufficient fact-finds were
recorded. It said that compensation required to be paid in only one case.

FT  22 MAY 93 / HK anxious over China MFN decision: What the colony stands
to lose if Beijing's trade privileges are curtailed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST interested bystander in the run-up to President Bill Clinton's
decision on June 3 to renew or not to renew China's most favoured nation
trading status is Hong Kong.
Hong Kong, which over the past decade has become China's most important
international port, has much to lose if the US decides to curtail China's
trading privileges.
China dominates the colony's burgeoning re-export trade. Last year Hong Kong
re-exported to the rest of the world goods of Chinese origin with a value of
HKDollars 403.8bn (Pounds 33.9bn) (up 28 per cent on 1991) and re-exported
to China goods with a value of HKDollars 212bn (up 38 per cent).
This re-export trade - which in real terms earns the colony between
HKDollars 16 to HKDollars 20 in every HKDollars 100 of re-exports - has
confirmed the colony's role as China's pre-eminent entrepot. But the
enmeshing of the two economies has made Hong Kong vulnerable to actions
taken against China.
The Hong Kong government reckons that in the worst case - the removal of
China's MFN status - Hong Kong's growth rate could halve from about 6 per
cent to 3 per cent and up to 70,000 workers lose their jobs.
The impact on southern China, principally Guangdong, has not been the
subject of economists' estimates. It is, however, a fair bet that in the
worst case many of the 3m who are employed in Hong Kong-owned factories
there would suffer the same fate as their Hong Kong compatriots.
One Hong Kong manufacturer of toys and electronic games in southern China
has told the local authorities that half its 3,000-member work force will be
shed if China loses its MFN status. 'We will immediately set up a factory in
Macao if China loses MFN,' a senior executive said.
Other observers in the colony, mostly academic economists, greet the annual
MFN renewal process with a degree of puzzlement. They point out that by
imposing conditions on China's MFN status, the US will be harming the
process that it has most applauded in the past, the growth of a capitalist
market in China.
They also observe that the US is trying to have it both ways. On the one
hand it applauds the migration of Hong Kong and Taiwanese businesses to the
mainland, and the 'subversive' impact that may have on the regime's control
of China, but on the other hand by seeking to make MFN conditional it
undermines that business migration.
Others, like Professor Y Y Kueh, of Lingnan College in Hong Kong, point to
the effects this business migration has had on the bilateral trade balances
of Hong Kong, Taiwan, and China with the US. From this perspective it is
possible to argue that the motivating force behind China's trade surplus
with the US is not China as such, but the transplanted factories of Hong
Kong and Taiwanese companies.
The links between investment and trade are well known and for Professor Kueh
it is no coincidence that the trade surpluses of Hong Kong and Taiwan with
the US fell off sharply at the same time as China's trade surplus with the
US began to take off. 'The downturn in the Hong Kong and Taiwan trade
surpluses with the US are the mirror images of the upturn in the mainland's
surplus with the US,' he said.
Whether the recognition of this will have much impact in Washington remains
to be seen. Yet curiously the prospect that President Clinton may attach
conditions to China's renewal of MFN - or threaten tough conditions in a
year's time if improvements in human rights, arms sales and trading
practices are not made - has failed to stir the colony as much as it has in
the past.
This is best seen in the behaviour of the local bourse which rises ever
higher on larger and larger volumes of transactions. This time last year and
indeed since 1990, when a Republican president was in the White House and
showed little interest in MFN conditionality, the annual ritual of MFN
renewal always had the power to undermine investor confidence.
What has changed this time is that Hong Kong has seen the likely list of
conditions Mr Clinton might apply and concluded that the colony, and
probably China, can live with them. Mr Paul Cheng, chairman of Hong Kong's
General Chamber of Commerce and the head of Inchcape, the UK trading house,
says: 'I am cautiously optimistic.'
Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, is also confident that he was able
to convince the US administration and Congress not to make Hong Kong's
political development a condition of renewal, if conditions are placed on
MFN. He also points out that for the US to enforce the sanction most touted
 -that higher tariffs be applied to goods from China's state-owned sector -
would be virtually impossible.
But in the end is also the view that annual MFN renewal process is the best
stick with which the US has to influence policy in China. According to Mr
Enzio von Pfeil, economist with Warburg Securities: 'At the end of the day I
do not think the Americans want to remove China's MFN. If they do they will
have lost their stick.'

FT  22 MAY 93 / Japanese trade surplus 'likely to decline'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Ministry of International Trade and Industry has responded to
growing criticism of the country's massive trade surplus with a report which
argues that it is likely to decline in the long run because of changes in
Japanese society and corporate organisations.
In its annual white paper on trade submitted to the cabinet yesterday,
Japanese trade officials rebut the argument that the country's trade surplus
is a result of its closed markets.
The report strongly criticises results-oriented approaches to solving trade
issues, which it says leads to protectionism, and calls for greater
co-operation between countries to promote a multilateral approach to world
trade.
The Japanese position on its trade surplus and proposals to deal with the
problem through a multilateral, free-market approach comes as the Clinton
administration has stepped up pressure on Japan to adopt a more 'managed'
approach in tackling its trade surplus.
The US has recently been showing impatience with its inability to reduce its
trade deficit with Japan, which grew for the 28th consecutive month to
Dollars 10.25bn (Pounds 6.6bn) from Dollars 7.11bn a year ago.
Miti's white paper argues that the common perception of Japan's trade
surplus as being due to the closed nature of markets is mistaken. Its recent
increase, according to Miti, is due to a number of factors unrelated to the
openness of its markets, such as the appreciation of the yen and weaker oil
prices, which make up for about half of the rise in the surplus since 1990.
At the same time, the recent rise of the surplus is due to the fall in
imports resulting from the bursting of the Japanese economic bubble.
Miti also argues that Japanese competitiveness in certain industries is what
lies behind Japan's surpluses in those specific sectors rather than the
closed nature of these markets as claimed by some.
The ministry further questions the view that having a trade surplus is
damaging to the world economy.
It says that in order to tackle the trade imbalance a re-evaluation of the
nature and effect of trade surpluses and multi-lateral co-operation in
promoting economic growth is needed.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Hopes raised by Japanese money growth

MONEY SUPPLY in Japan expanded 0.6 per cent in April, following a revised
contraction of 0.4 per cent in March, prompting the Bank of Japan to suggest
that signs of economic recovery are emerging.
Bank officials said the preliminary year-on-year expansion in M2 plus
certificates of deposit reflected the effects of two stimulatory packages
announced in recent months by the government, which has pumped extra funds
into public works. Money supply has contracted in six of the past seven
months, but the bank argues that firm growth will be seen this quarter,
partly because of the government packages, but also because lower interest
rates have encouraged economic activity.
The bank said the broadest measure, which includes postal and agricultural
institution savings, grew 2.5 per cent in April, up from a revised 2.0 per
cent in March, as money continued to flow into the postal savings system.
The preliminary expansion in March had been 2.3 per cent.
But bank officials are concerned that consumer demand remains weak and that
two-thirds of Japanese companies have announced profit falls during the
present profit season, the third year of decline, with many forecasting a
fourth year of decline and a reduction in capital spending.
Japan's Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission yesterday asked for
indictment of a property company executive and a former finance company
manager for alleged stock price manipulation. Mr Makoto Araya, president of
Teishin Fudo, and Mr Hiroshi Kimura, a former managing director at Sumitomo
Fudosan Finance, are alleged to have unlawfully ramped Nihon Unisys stock.

<TEXT>
EC FINANCE ministers last night opened a two-day informal meeting expected
to focus on prospects for growth to tackle Europe's unemployment problem and
tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism.
The Danish presidency of the EC is hoping the tax cuts unveiled after this
week's successful referendum on Maastricht will galvanise other member
states to follow suit. The aim is to create momentum for an EC growth
package ahead of next month's summit in Copenhagen.
Ministers will also discuss a report on last September's ERM crisis which
led to the withdrawal of the British pound and the Italian lira. But the
report, by the EC's monetary committee of senior treasury officials and
central bankers, does not recommend substantial changes.
The UK declared this week it would not rejoin the ERM in the near future and
stuck to its argument that there are fundamental 'fault-lines' in the system
which act to the detriment of weaker currencies. Yet EC and British
officials say the UK has not put forward proposals to change operation of
the ERM, mainly because it does not wish to offend France and Germany.
Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance minister, is likely to be questioned
about his call for revision of 'convergence criteria' for monetary union if
recession continues.

After 10 days of negotiations, the leaders of Bavaria's Christian Social
Union, junior partners in the Bonn coalition, decided yesterday that Mr
Edmund Stoiber should become the new Bavarian prime minister, after Mr Max
Streibl resigns in the summer, writes Quentin Peel.
The decision means that Mr Theo Waigel, the party leader, will remain
finance minister in the Bonn government - although it was clear that he
would have preferred to come home to Bavaria. Mr Stoiber, now interior
minister in Munich, has emerged as the strong man in the CSU, but has agreed
to step down from his post as deputy party leader as part of the compromise.

according to figures published by the Commerce Ministry, writes Stefan
Wagstyl in New Delhi.
The reformist government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, sees
export expansion as a key motor for India's economic growth. However, export
growth was held back in the year to March by a slump in sales to the
countries of the former Communist bloc and by inter-religious violence in
Bombay and elsewhere. Imports in the year grew 12.05 per cent to Dollars
21.7bn, leaving an overall trade deficit of Dollars 3.3bn.

A bomb killed four people and injured 16 outside a police station in central

The explosion fits a pattern of violence by Moslem militants fighting to
turn Egypt into a strict Islamic state. More than 120 people have been
killed since March last year, by militant gunmen and bombers or in
retaliatory raids by the security forces.
The blast was in an area near the headquarters of two daily newspapers and

THE BANK of Portugal, the central bank, yesterday lowered the central bank
discount rate and its bond reference rate for the first time in five years,
writes Peter Wise in Lisbon. The discount rate was brought down from 14.5
per cent to 13.5 per cent and the bond reference rate from 16 to 14.5 per
cent.
The discount rate is a little used non-binding reference rate with little
impact on the money markets. Today, the central bank's main intervention
rates are its liquidity mop-up rate and liquidity injection rates, now at 13
and 13.75 per cent respectively. The bond reference rate is widely used in
both private and public bond issues.
The bank has been encouraged by falling inflation: the year-on-year rate for
April fell to 6.2 per cent, the lowest since 1973.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Perez trips up over his own reforms: The suspension of
Venezuela's president over corruption charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela who was suspended from office
yesterday over allegations of corruption - is in part a victim of his own
attempts to reform Venezuela.
In trying to change the country's traditionally corrupt judicial system, he
encouraged the independence of the Supreme Court. It was this body that on
Thursday handed down a crucial ruling that there was sufficient cause to try
him for corruption.
The court ruling paved the way for yesterday's unanimous vote by the Senate
for impeachment - meaning that Mr Perez is automatically suspended from his
duties as chief executive and must answer criminal charges before the 15
members of the Supreme Court.
Previously, a president could count on the highest court to support any
government initiative, since most justices were closely linked to the ruling
party. But Mr Perez last year appointed five new justices who were political
independents.
It was also the president who supported more independence for a central bank
whose foreign exchange receipts have provided evidence against him in the
case. He also openly encouraged political debate and tolerated vociferous
opposition and calls for his resignation, eventually culminating in the
corruption charges.
The irony is that many of the trends Mr Perez tried to reverse in his second
term of office - big government, state inefficiency and an arrogant
political class - were those that he set in train himself in his first
administration during the oil boom in the 1970s.
In a TV address after the Supreme Court voted on Thursday on the charges of
fraudulently managing Dollars 17m in government funds, the President's voice
broke and he seemed ready to burst into tears. 'I would have preferred a
different death,' he said.
As a result of the Senate vote, a former underling, Senator Octavio Lepage,
takes over as acting president until the full Venezuelan congress decides on
a legislator to fill the rest of Mr Perez's term.
Mr Perez, 70, was elected by a large majority in 1988 and his period in
office is due to expire in February 1994.
His critics assert that charges sent to the Supreme Court by Attorney
General Ramon Escovar Salom on March 11 show that Mr Perez and two former
cabinet ministers, Mr Alejandro Izaguirre and Mr Reinaldo Figueredo
Planchart, used Dollars 17m allotted for security and defence purposes for
other ends.
The president and his supporters say that while administrative
irregularities did occur in handling the money, there is no evidence of
criminal action by Mr Perez or his two former ministers. They consider the
charges and subsequent actions as vengeance against Mr Perez by foes
collected in more than 50 years of politics. The attorney general's charges
centre on documented evidence that money from a secret fund slated for
security and defence purposes outside Venezuela were paid to the wrong
ministry: the ministry of the presidential secretariat rather than to the
ministry of the interior, which had original responsibilities for the funds.
Mr Perez has said he will not divulge how the money was spent since it
involved confidential actitivities. He is only the latest in a line of
presidents who had access to secret government funds and there was
previously no accounting of how these funds were used.
Another accusation made against Mr Perez - although not in formal charges -
was that he and associates used their knowledge that the government would
soon eliminate multiple exchange rates to make a large foreign exchange gain
in early 1989. The money - 250m Bolivars was converted at 14.5 to the dollar
to around Dollars 17m. When a few days later exchange controls were lifted,
the Bolivar was devalued to more than 34 to the dollar.
Almost since he took office in February 1989, Mr Perez has been unpopular.
He instituted highly unpopular economic reforms in keeping with an extended
agreement with the International Monetary Fund. His economic reforms, which
lifted generalised food subsidies, for example, created hardship for many
poor Venezuelans and brought strong opposition early in his government.
These political and economic problems exploded in February 1992 when army
officers attempted a coup. They said they tried to topple the government to
make Venezuelan democracy more responsible, to eliminate corruption and to
rid the country of IMF-inspired measures.
The political situation worsened during 1992 and another attempted coup was
staged in November. Throughout all this, Mr Perez came under attack not only
as the father of unpopular economic reform but also a representive of old,
corrupt politics.
Mr Perez admitted to numerous errors. In the end, the task of overhauling
the country turned out to be too much. He could not complete economic or
political reform, and was unable to carry through plans to privatise
government companies or rebuild Venezuela's crumbling health, education and
public safety systems.
He became a lightning rod for grievances caused by accumulated mistakes,
corruption and abuses of recent decades.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Outcry over life sentence for East Timor rebel leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN Indonesian court yesterday sentenced Mr Xanana Gusmao, the East Timor
rebel leader, to life imprisonment, provoking international criticism.
Mr Gusmao, leader of the Fretilin movement which has been waging a guerrilla
campaign for independence since 1975, was found guilty of separatism,
rebellion and illegal possession of arms after a three-month trial.
Portuguese President Mario Soares described the sentence as 'hard, violent
and illegitimate'.
Amnesty International, the human rights group, said Mr Gusmao had suffered a
blatantly unfair trial in which he had been ordered to stop after reading
two pages of his final 29-page defence plea because the judge said his
remarks were 'irrelevant'.
Indonesia invaded and annexed the island territory of East Timor after the
Portuguese colonial administration withdrew in 1975. Relief organisations
believe up to 200,000 East Timorese have died from disease, starvation and
in fighting. Indonesian sovereignty is not recognised by the United Nations.
International pressure over widespread allegations of human rights abuses in
East Timor was stepped up after November 1991 when soldiers fired into a
crowd of independence demonstrators. Witnesses said up to 180 people died.
Indonesia accuses Mr Gusmao of backing the demonstration, which Jakarta says
incited the troops to fire.
The life sentence was sought by the prosecution. Judge Hieronymus Godang
told the court in Dili, capital of East Timor: 'The reason the punishment is
so heavy is that the defendant's actions disturbed stability in East Timor.'
Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, Portuguese prime minister, said the sentence served
to undermine the dialogue between the Lisbon and Jakarta governments aimed
at reaching an internationally acceptable solution for East Timor.
The countries' foreign ministers have been meeting under the auspices of Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general, to seek
confidence-building measures to help reach a solution for East Timor. The
next meeting is set for September in New York.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Pollution fund run by IADB may end Nafta conflict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROPOSAL to establish an environmental fund within the InterAmerican
Development Bank to help tackle pollution problems on the Mexican border
with the US is being examined by the two governments.
The suggestion, which comes from the IADB, is aimed at helping to defuse
opposition by environmentalists to the North American Free Trade Agreement
between the US, Canada and Mexico.
The Nafta agreement has to be ratified by the legislatures of all three
countries, but is opposed by an important section of the US Congress. Side
agreements to cover labour and environmental issues - meant to prevent
companies shifting operations to Mexico to take advantage of lax enforcement
of labour and environmental standards - are now being negotiated.
The trust fund would be supported by the three Nafta and set up with only a
small amount of paid-in capital: a Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) fund would
require Dollars 250m to be paid in, with the rest callable. The cost to
government budgets would be substantially reduced.
Once established, the fund could then borrow on international capital
markets, with the guarantee of its three government shareholders, at
relatively low interest rates. The fund would be administered by the Bank,
which has experience in lending for environmental improvements throughout
Latin America, and would lend to regional and municipal authorities and
utilities in Mexico.
One idea gaining ground in Washington has been for the establishment of a
North American Development Bank to fund environmental clean-up and help
areas which suffer job losses apparently because of the agreement. However,
such a bank would be expensive to establish and would take a long time to
start operations.
On the other hand, other mechanisms would probably be required to cover
problems in Canada or the US - such as job losses or clean-ups on the US
side of the border with Mexico - since all the Bank's past experience has
been in Latin America and the Caribbean. With the fund borrowing at market
interest rates, it would be unable to provide concessional resources.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Most CIS states to get own currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOST OF the former states of the Soviet Union are expected to introduce
their own currencies in the next year, as a result of the International
Monetary Fund's stance on linking its support to the control of inflation.
The IMF, now negotiating with Russia over a Pounds 1.5bn initial tranche of
support, changed its position of encouraging the former Soviet states to
remain in the rouble zone after it became clear that the Russian central
bank's generous credits to industry and the budget would continue, and with
it very high levels of inflation.
The reversal will place some pressure on the other states to leave the
rouble zone to benefit from Fund, World Bank and bilateral support for a
reform programme.
Its consequences have been highlighted this month by the introduction in
Kyrgyzia, one of the smallest and poorest of the newly independent states,
of its own currency, the som. The currency has Dollars 400m (Pounds 260m)
backing from the IMF, the World Bank and the Japanese government - a
relatively large sum for a small and poor country - to support its pegged
rate of four som to the dollar.
Mr Tursunbek Chyngyshev, the Kyrgyz prime minister, said officials from
other states had told him before the som was introduced that they supported
his move and would all follow suit shortly. 'They all believe it is
inevitable and that Russia itself will soon make the decision to create its
own currency.'
Russia is still the banker for most of the 15 former Soviet states - though
it is increasingly limiting the credits paid out to them and in some cases,
as with Ukraine, has stopped issuing credits entirely. Mr Boris Fyodorov,
the Russian finance minister, this week welcomed Kyrgyzia's adoption of the
som as an example for others.
The rouble has been, since the beginning of this year, printed with 'Bank of
Russia' rather than 'USSR'. However, it is still available to all states, in
both cash notes and so-called 'cashless' credits through accounts between
the central banks of the republics and of Russia.
IMF officials are making it clear to the republics that a decision to remain
in the rouble zone is their own to make, but if they decided to remain they
would be treated as an economic extension of Russia. If an agreement was
reached between the Fund and Russia, these states could also hope to
conclude one; if none was, they would probably be unable to conclude their
own.
Besides the three Baltic states - which declared independence first and
introduced currencies or coupons last year - only Ukraine has yet to
conclude an agreement with the IMF, and its currency is closer to a coupon
than to a fully-fledged money issue.
Turkmenistan, another Central Asian state, has said it will create its own
currency in the autumn. Its economy, based on huge reserves of natural gas,
is much stronger than Kyrgyzia's.
Kazakhstan has only a few days to prevent crops in the south of the country
from being devastated by locusts, but a government official said yesterday
he was confident the threat would be eliminated. Reuter reports from Moscow.
Deputy agriculture minister Viktor Kosarev was quoted in the Kazakh capital
Alma-Ata as saying more than half of the 300,000 hectares of pasture land
infested with locust larvae had already been sprayed with chemicals in an
operation using 14 aircraft and 200 tractors. The locusts would be destroyed
this month.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Democratic senators close ranks behind Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMOCRATIC senators yesterday closed ranks behind President Bill Clinton's
budget plan, but Senator David Boren of Oklahoma, who earlier this week
broke with the White House, remained adamant in his opposition to the energy
tax which is a key component of the plan.
Even Democrats from oil-producing states, who share Mr Boren's hostility to
the energy tax, rallied behind the administration's plan, criticising Mr
Boren's alternative proposals for hurting the elderly.
'The breakaway group broke too far,' said Senator John Breaux of Louisiana,
who earlier in the week had been expected to join Mr Boren in his rebellion.
Senate Democratic leaders, however, held out the possibility of further
concessions to help shield certain industries from the impact of the energy
tax, which will be levied on the thermal content of fuels, and Mr Boren,
too, opened the door to some form of energy tax.
Mr Boren's opposition is enough to block the Clinton budget bill from moving
forward from the Senate finance committee, in which he holds a crucial swing
vote.
The Boren alternative, unveiled with the backing of Senator Bennett
Johnston, another Democrat, and two Republicans, would eliminate the energy
tax, which is expected to raise Dollars 71.5bn (Pounds 46.4bn) over five
years, and replace it with caps on pension and health benefits for the
elderly.
It stands no chance of passage, because it trips over Senate procedural
rules that would require it to win 60 votes, not just a normal majority of
51. But its backers believe it could form the basis for a bipartisan
compromise.

US PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's health care task force has come under fire from
several directions over its proposal for a radical shift in the burden of
responsibility for medical malpractice.
The proposal would transfer the burden of liability away from individual
doctors and on to the hospitals, insurers or health plans they work with.
Doctors have long complained that the threat of malpractice lawsuits drives
up their costs and forces them to prescribe unnecessary defensive medical
procedures, but the move to 'enterprise liability' proposed by the White
House task force, chaired by the president's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton,
has failed to satisfy them.
Insurance companies complained that the shift would not address the
underlying problems of escalating jury awards of damages for medical
malpractice, and might make the situation worse.
'It just shifts the liability,' said Mr Tom O'Day, associate vice-president
for government affairs at the Alliance of American Insurers, a grouping of
insurance companies. Consumer advocates are critical of the enterprise
liability proposal, fearing it may mean inadequate discipline is applied to
incompetent doctors.
The shift to enterprise liability rests on the assumption that most people
will, after the Clinton reforms, be covered by a health plan grouping
particular doctors and hospitals who have agreed to a certain scale of fees,
instead of by a general insurance policy that allows them to visit any
doctor. A patient would then sue the health plan, rather than the individual
doctor.
Doctors in the US are estimated to pay about Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.5bn) a
year in liability premiums to cover themselves against the cost of
malpractice lawsuits. In addition, some studies have estimated that Dollars
20bn to Dollars 30bn a year of unnecessary medical tests and procedures are
prescribed by doctors to guard against any accusation of negligence.
Other analysts, however, say that many of these tests would be performed
anyway, and that the threat of malpractice suits may have led to better
medical care.
Critics of the current system say the most severe costs may be invisible:
many newly qualified doctors steer clear of specialities such as
anaesthesiology and obstetrics because of the prevalence of lawsuits and the
higher liability insurance rates. Many communities have to travel far afield
to obtain care as a result.
Whether the impact of liability suits is exaggerated, public perception is
that they are a big factor in rising health care costs.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Greece liberalises capital movement

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GREECE has loosened controls on medium-term capital movement to other
European Community countries, making it easier for residents to borrow in
foreign currency and buy securities abroad.
Under the new central bank directives, Greeks are no longer required to hold
foreign securities for at least one year and are also allowed to invest
abroad in derivatives for the first time.
Companies can borrow in foreign exchange without restriction, while all
forward transactions in drachmas with a duration of more than three months
are permitted.
The liberalisation will be extended to non-EC countries later this year, the
Bank of Greece said.
The central bank has also transferred its responsibility for day-to-day
monitoring of capital movements to the commercial banks, in an effort to
reduce bureaucratic delay in handling foreign exchange transactions.
'Effectively, we have taken away 90 per cent of remaining exchange
restrictions. The rest will be automatically lifted next July,' a Bank of
Greece official said.
Greece was allowed by its Community partners to maintain existing controls
on capital movement for 18 months after the launch of the single market.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Italian budget raises taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE government of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi yesterday unveiled a L12,500bn
(Pounds 5.3bn) mini-budget raising taxes and cutting spending to hold down
Italy's public sector deficit.
Most of the L5,950bn extra revenue will come from raising the tax on petrol
and increasing the size of the end-of-year advance VAT payments required of
companies.
Spending cuts will mainly affect central government transfers to local
authorities, block hiring of new teachers (Italy has the highest number of
teachers per capita in Europe) and involve a selective freeze on
disbursements from the treasury's numerous special funds.
'This sort of action is certainly not popular; but it is unfortunately
necessary,' Mr Ciampi said after yesterday's cabinet meeting.
The former central bank governor, who assumed the premiership on April 26,
added: 'This is a correction during the course of the year because the
deficit was moving away from the target.'
The clear commitment by the Ciampi government to austerity, combined with
encouraging signs of continued falling inflation and a fresh cut in the Bank
of Italy's discount rate, boosted the lira. Yesterday the Italian currency
was trading close to L900 against the D-Mark, a strengthening of nearly L100
in a month.
In January the Amato government agreed with the EC as a condition of
obtaining a Ecu8bn (Pounds 6.3bn) loan facility that Italy's 1993 deficit
would be held below 11 per cent of GDP or around L150,000bn.
The new measures should ensure that the deficit is around L154,000 -
providing the L7,000bn promised from privatisation materialises.
Officials estimated the petrol price rises would add no more than 0.2
percentage points to inflation during the year. Yesterday, preliminary
figures in the big cities for May indicated inflation was running at an
annualised rate of 4 per cent - the lowest since 1969.
Although work on the mini-budget was begun by the previous government, the
final shape was provided by the new economic team. This is still headed by
Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, but now includes Prof Luigi
Spaventa, the budget minister, and Mr Franco Gallo in the Finance Ministry.
Yesterday Prof Spaventa said the primary deficit would be L37,500bn for the
year. This small primary deficit underlines the extent to which servicing
Italy's huge debt weighs on the budget.
But the cost of interest payments on the debt was eased this week by the cut
in the discount rate to 10.5 per cent.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Falcone murder commemorated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN authorities, for the first time, have decided to make the
commemoration of a Mafia murder a national event.
Instructions have gone out to all schools to observe a minute's silence
today for Mr Giovanni Falcone, the leading anti-Mafia magistrate who was
killed with his wife and their bodyguards on May 23 last year. The
commemoration also covers Mr Paolo Borsellino, Mr Falcone's colleague,
killed with his escort two months later.
In Palermo where both killings occurred, as well as throughout all big
Italian cities, ceremonies and demonstrations are planned over the weekend
to commemorate these two brutal killings.
Magistrates investigating the Falcone murder revealed this week that his
secret movements were almost certainly betrayed to the Mafia from inside
Italy's security services. Since last December, Mr Bruno Contrada, head of
Mafia intelligence in Sisde, the domestic intelligence service, has been in
custody on allegations of consorting with the Mafia.
Recent tests on cigarette butts - left by those who planted the huge
explosive device which killed Mr Falcone as he drove into Palermo from the
airport - show three people were involved. But no arrests have been made of
those who carried out the bombing. In the case of the Borsellino killing,
police have arrested a man for alleged involvement in placing the fatal car
bomb. This week also saw the capture of Nitto Santapoala, the number two in
the Sicilian Mafia who is believed to have been behind the killings.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Spanish Socialists put up a fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHORT, sharp Spanish election campaign officially began yesterday, as two
nationwide opinion polls showed the ruling Socialists of Mr Felipe Gonzalez
in the lead but well short of winning enough seats on June 6 to be able to
govern on their own.
Addressing 25,000 supporters in a Valencia bullring, Mr Gonzalez appealed to
voters for help to continue modernising Spain and to ensure it was never
again isolated from the rest of the world as under the Franco regime.
The latest polls - one in the Madrid daily newspaper Diario 16 and the
another in the Catalan daily El Periodico - both seem to reflect a surge in
Socialist support even after May 13. That was when the government was forced
to devalue the peseta by 8 per cent and when it published official figures
showing that 253,000 people had lost their jobs in the first three months of
the year.
The opinion polls confirmed the feelings of some seasoned observers of
Spanish politics that the main challenger, the conservative Partido Popular
 -whose leader, Mr Jose Maria Aznar, was welcomed in Britain by Prime
Minister John Major this week as 'Spain's next prime minister'  - has failed
to capitalise on the government's economic troubles.
Diario 16 said its poll showed the Socialists winning 35 per cent of the
vote to the PP's 33 per cent. El Periodico had the Socialists at 35 but the
PP at 30.7 per cent, well down on most recent polls.
Voter turnout on June 6 is expected to be as high as 80 per cent. But some
polling organisations say as many as 5 per cent of the electorate may not
make up their minds how to vote until they have their ballot papers.
While the Socialists appear to have made big gains at the expense of their
opponents after the devaluation, the party has been made to appear
incompetent in the principality of Asturias, which it governs. In an effort
to capture votes, the regional government recently announced it had secured
agreement from a foreign investor to build a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) oil
refinery in the region.
But the Saudi International Bank, which the Asturians had announced was
leading the project, has denied all knowledge of it. It seems that no-one in
Asturias ever bothered to call the bank to check the credentials of a
mystery middle-man who conducted negotiations and who has now disappeared.
The Asturian Socialists are not saying whether they paid the man any
commissions.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINIAN legislators yesterday refused to accept Prime Minister Leonid
Kuchma's resignation, offered on Thursday. It was a big political setback
for President Leonid Kravchuk, who had tried to undermine him.
The unexpected surge of support for the reformist Mr Kuchma has resulted in
a political stalemate which must be resolved in the coming weeks if Ukraine
is to address its mounting economic problems.
Although the president lost his bid for extra powers, parliament also failed
to give Mr Kuchma the expanded economic authority he requested at the
beginning of the week.
On Thursday, Mr Kravchuk asked that the president should take the place of
the prime minister as the head of the Ukrainian cabinet.
On Thursday, parliament appeared inclined to back Mr Kravchuk's proposal. Mr
Kuchma has bluntly warned MPs that if he remains in office they can expect
price increases and slashed government subsidies. That was a message the
industrialists and collective farm chairmen who dominate the legislature
appeared reluctant to accept.
By contrast, during his 18 months as president Mr Kravchuk has shied away
from tough economic decisions and many MPs appeared to expect that with the
president at the head of the government they would get a softer ride, at
least in the short term.
The swing issue appeared to be Mr Kuchma's brief announcement of a telegram
sent from Russia late on Thursday demanding world prices for its oil and
gas. This would deliver a crushing blow to Ukraine's economy, traditionally
dependent on subsidised energy from its northern neighbour.
In these circumstances, MPs overwhelming voted to reject Mr Kuchma's
resignation. However, the fickle parliament's shift has not resolved the
question of who is to steer the economy through what is likely to be a hot
summer.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Steel industry changes may see stockholders sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESTRUCTURING Europe's recession-torn steel industry could have important
knock-on effects as mills dispose of stockholding subsidiaries to
concentrate their cash on steelmaking, according to a report.
The shake-out could produce some 'interesting opportunities' for the
financially stronger mills, since there are good reasons to integrate
downstream into stockholding, says the study by London-based CRU
International.
Almost all European mills have expanded into stockholding - many during the
late 1980s, when profits from steel production were high.
British Steel also has stockholding interests in Germany, France, the
Netherlands, Ireland, Spain and Norway. Usinor-Sacilor, meanwhile, has
bought stockholders in nine European countries outside France where it is
based.
Some mills have acquired stockholders to gain market share. But CRU says
that the most compelling reason for integration between a steel mill and a
stockholder is that it adds to the mill's processing capacity.
The capital spending needed for additional processing facilities could
introduce a valuable barrier to entry into a business where barriers are now
low, says CRU.
This could cause two types of stockholders to emerge. Larger companies,
often owned by steel mills, will tend to specialise in the product range of
their parent companies, and will increasingly focus on processing steel.
These companies may have better profit margins than the second category of
general stockholders, which do little or no processing. But takeovers may be
more frequent in this category, because asset values have been depressed by
the recession or owners have come under financial pressure.

plans a referendum

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN may be able to conclude its negotiations for membership of the
European Community by the end of the year, Ms Anne Wibble. Swedish finance
minister, said yesterday, Reuter reports from London.
'There are of course a number of important issues to discuss but neither we
nor the Commission can see any serious problems,' she said.
'The negotiations are now well under way and we hope to make substantial
progress during the Belgian presidency, possibly even conclude the
negotiations.'
Belgium will hold the six-month rotating EC presidency for the second half
of 1993.
Ms Wibble said the issues to be discussed included Sweden's financial
contributions, regional and agricultural policy and trade relations with
third countries.
Negotiations are also taking place on EC membership for Sweden's Nordic
neighbours, Finland and Norway. Sweden plans to hold a referendum on the
question next year.
Ms Wibble said Sweden would plan to join the European single currency
proposed in the Maastricht treaty on European union.
But she and Mr Thomas Franzen, the Swedish central bank deputy governor,
said the Swedish crown, whose link with the European Currency Unit was
severed during last year's upheaval in the European currency markets, would
continue to float for now.
Mr Franzen said the crown's 17 per cent devaluation since the break was
'excessive' and could lead to economic imbalance as exports grew while the
home market stagnated.
'We must have a more balanced situation in our economy and a more stable
international environment before we can return to a fixed exchange rate
regime,' he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN and British foreign ministers claimed yesterday that substantial
progress was being made on new initiatives to end the fighting in Bosnia, in
spite of President Bill Clinton's reservations on setting up expanded 'safe
havens' for Bosnian Moslems.
Neither Mr Andrei Kozyrev nor Mr Douglas Hurd disclosed details after
discussions in Washington with Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of
state. But both hinted that all three, plus Mr Alain Juppe of France, could
meet again today in either Washington or New York.
The foreign minister of Spain, which is one of the nations with peacekeeping
troops in Bosnia, has also been invited to join the discussions.
Mr Clinton, speaking after a White House meeting with Mr Kozyrev, said the
US was 'sceptical that we'll be able to resolve this satisfactorily within
the framework that has been proposed'. He went on: 'I don't want to see the
US get in a position where we're re-creating Northern Ireland, Lebanon or
Cyprus or anything else.'
He saw 'some potential down the road' for a peacekeeping operation, but
added: 'We don't want our people in there basically in a shooting gallery.'
His comments contrasted sharply with those of Mr Kozyrev, who insisted after
meeting the president that the US and Russia were 'very, very close' to an
agreement that could be presented to the European allies.
But a senior British official emphasised that the allies accepted that the
US would not send ground troops as a contribution to an expanded military
force to protect the safe havens.
The United Nations Security Council is due next week to consider the safe
havens, as well as the setting up of a war crimes tribunal and the
stationing of possibly 500 inspectors on the Serbia-Bosnia border to observe
whether Serbia is honouring its pledge to stop military and fuel supplies to
the Bosnian Serbs.
Mr Hurd conceded that the question of the implicit recognition of Serb
territorial gains 'will have to be answered' when full details of the new
peace initiative are made known.
Mr Christopher, according to several US press reports, has come round to the
view that it is impossible to roll back all the Serb gains and is prepared
to accept the safe haven notion so long as it is, as one senior official put
it, 'a temporary measure and not the endorsement of any concept of
partition'.
That concern seems to underline Mr Clinton's reservations. The White House
also made clear on Thursday that the US wants to avoid the impression that
'ethnic cleansing' by both Serbs and Croats is being rewarded.
Mr Clinton was not entirely dismissive of chances of an international
agreement. He said that 'ultimately there will have to be some reasonable
borders and some political solutions which have a reasonable territorial
component'. In such circumstances, he implied, US ground forces could be
peacekeepers.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Ministers put spending target under threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPENDING departments in Whitehall have ignored a firm Treasury instruction
not to seek increased resources for next year and instead submitted bids for
extra funds totalling several billion pounds.
The threat to the Treasury's public spending targets emerged as the Prime
Minister's Office sought yesterday to calm the political row which erupted
this week over radical proposals to shrink the welfare state.
With Mr John Major anxious to direct attention to the latest batch of
favourable economic indicators, his aides said that options thrown up by the
Treasury's long-term spending review were unlikely to result in immediate
decisions.
But the decision by virtually all the main departments - the exception is
defence - to fight for additional resources in this summer's spending
negotiations underlined the severity of the looming cabinet clash over
Whitehall budgets.
There were renewed indications that some departments are determined to press
for the extension into 1994 of a published current public sector pay limit.
The Treasury opposes maintaining the present 1.5 per cent pay ceiling,
arguing for informal restraint. But several cabinet ministers - including
those on the party's right wing - believe it will be impossible to hold the
line on public sector wages without the formal ceiling.
The expected clashes have prompted Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary
to the Treasury, to bring forward to mid-June the traditional cabinet
discussion on spending priorities. Mr Portillo will have time to hold an
intense round of discussions with his spending colleagues before the August
holidays.
Yesterday, shadow chancellor Gordon Brown said he planned to raise the whole
question of public spending and public service cuts - including the possible
introduction of charges for National Health Service beds - when he addresses
the Welsh Labour party conference in Llandudno today.
Mr Portillo insisted this week that the government was determined to stick
to the cash ceilings for Whitehall spending set last autumn for the
financial years 1994/95 and 1995/96.
The ceilings for the two years - Pounds 253.6bn and Pounds 263.3bn
respectively - were agreed by the cabinet last autumn and re-affirmed in Mr
Norman Lamont's March Budget. They imply small cuts in overall expenditure
once inflation has been taken into account.
In an attempt to hold the line earlier this year, Mr Portilloasked
colleagues to abandon the traditional practice of bidding for extra cash and
to provide the Treasury with options for cuts of between 2.5 and 5 per cent.
But ministers said the home office and social security, health, education,
environment, and transport departments - which account for more than
three-quarters of all spending - have rejected any budget reductions.
Instead they have submitted additional bids which one senior Whitehall
official said ran into 'many billions'.
The Treasury has set aside a Pounds 7bn contingency reserve for unforeseen
expenditure in 1994/95 but only half can be allocated during the summer.
A substantial proportion of the remainder has already been earmarked to
cover the knock-on effect of additional expenditure agreed for the present
financial year.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Ireland's president to take tea at the palace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER seven decades during which British monarchs seemed to overlook the
existence of the neighbouring Irish Republic, the royal frost has now thawed
a little. Ireland's President Mary Robinson has been invited to London for
tea with the Queen.
Buckingham Palace did not announce next Thursday's visit, but it confirmed
leaks from Dublin. It will be a private visit, a courtesy call, a palace
official said yesterday. There is no question of a state occasion.
The Queen went to Germany last year, hoping to heal wounds of the second
world war. She visited Spain in 1988, shrugging off the UK's territorial
dispute over Gibraltar. In the US, once a British colony, the Queen draws
crowds. The French have been known to wave flags for her.
But historical divisions between Britain and Ireland live on. No British
king or queen has met an Irish president. The last monarch to visit southern
Ireland was Edward VII in 1903 - almost 20 years before the partitioning of
Ulster and the creation of an Irish Free State.
Next week's visit illustrates the improvement in UK-Irish government
relations which - even as late as the 1980s - were punctuated by
ill-tempered outbursts over the extradition of Irish terrorists, or the
quality of British justice.
The neighbourliness is not reflected, however, in Northern Ireland.
Yesterday local election results in the province set back hopes of Irish and
British ministers that 'round-table' political talks on the province's
political future would be re-started soon.
The better-than-expected performance of the Rev Ian Paisley's hard-line
Democratic Unionist party will only encourage him in his pledge not to
resume negotiations until Ireland compromises on its territorial claim on
the north. Also faring well was Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA
which is excluded from talks by both the Irish and the British governments.
The territorial dispute over Northern Ireland remains the unofficial reason
why diplomats in London and Dublin continue to advise their respective heads
of state against a formal meeting.
But there are, perhaps, personal memories too; the Queen's cousin Lord
Mountbatten was murdered by the IRA in 1979.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Inflation lowest for 29 years: Chancellor hails 1.3% annual
RPI rate as 'astonishing' achievement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S battered reputation for economic management received a
boost yesterday with news that inflation had come down to its lowest level
for 29 years.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, hailed the drop in retail price inflation
in April to a year-on-year rate of 1.3 per cent as an 'astonishing'
achievement that would underpin an upturn by helping investment and jobs.
UK inflation is now well below half the 3.5 per cent average in European
Community countries. Only Denmark among Britain's EC partners has a lower
figure.
The response in financial markets was more muted, with gilts, London share
prices and sterling all registering falls. Many investors believe UK
inflation has bottomed, and may rise strongly in coming months assuming the
recovery picks up. The retail prices index last month was 1.3 per cent
higher than in April last year, after a year-on-year rise of 1.9 per cent in
March. Excluding mortgage interest payments, the RPI rose 2.9 per cent
between April 1992 and last month, after increasing 3.5 per cent in the 12
months to March. The lowest rate by this measure since the government
started records in 1975 was exceptionally good news for the Treasury, which
aims to keep this figure below 4 per cent.
Although generally weak demand pressures caused by the recession played
their part, the overriding reason for the shift in the headline RPI rate was
the switch from poll tax to council tax last month. The average householder
now pays a far smaller bill for local taxes.
Another measure of inflation - the RPI excluding both mortgage payments and
local tax payments - showed a small rise between March and April from 3.2
per cent to 3.3 per cent. The year-on-year rise in this measure stood at 3.3
per cent in December last year and reached a low of 2.9 per cent in January.
Mr Lamont, in bullish comments to reporters outside 11 Downing Street,
concentrated on the headline RPI figure, heralding this as 'excellent news'.
He added: 'Britain is very firmly in the low inflation camp among the major
economies and I am determined that we are going to stay that way.'
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, was less enthusiastic. He warned
that inflation would go up in coming months.
A similarly downbeat mood was evident on financial markets, where the
inflation news failed to excite investors, even though the headline RPI
figure was slightly lower than the City had expected. Mr John Shepperd, an
economist at SG Warburg Securities, said: 'We are not seeing any fundamental
improvement (on inflation), more a statistical blip.'
Such sentiments unsettled investors on the gilt market, where 10-year
securities lost a quarter of a point. London shares slid fractionally, with
the FT-SE 100 index of leading stocks shedding 4.6 to close at 2,812.2. On
the foreign exchange markets, the pound lost a quarter of a pfennig against
a weak D-Mark to finish at DM2.5075, though up more than 4 pfennigs on the
week. In New York, sterling closed at DM2.50945. Against the dollar, the
pound closed in London at Dollars 1.5415 and in New York at Dollars 1.543.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Treasury public spending target under assault
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPENDING departments in Whitehall have ignored a firm Treasury instruction
not to seek increased resources for next year and instead submitted bids for
extra funds totalling several billion pounds.
The threat to the Treasury's public spending targets emerged as the prime
minister's office sought yesterday to calm the political row which erupted
this week over radical proposals to shrink the welfare state.
With Mr John Major anxious to direct attention to the latest batch of
favourable economic indicators, his aides said that options thrown up by the
Treasury's long-term spending review were unlikely to result in immediate
decisions.
But the decision by virtually all the main departments - the exception is
defence - to fight for additional resources in this summer's spending
negotiations underlined the severity of the looming cabinet clash over
Whitehall budgets.
There were renewed indications that some departments are determined to press
for the extension into 1994 of a published current public sector pay limit.
The Treasury vigorously opposes maintaining the present 1.5 per cent pay
ceiling, arguing for informal restraint. But several cabinet ministers -
including those on the right wing of party - believe it will be impossible
to hold the line on public sector wages without the formal ceiling.
The expected clashes have prompted Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary
to the Treasury, to bring forward to mid-June the traditional cabinet
discussion on spending priorities. Mr Portillo will have time to hold an
intense round of discussions with his spending colleagues before the August
holidays.
The chief secretary insisted this week that the government was determined to
stick to the cash ceilings for Whitehall spending set last autumn for the
financial years 1994/95 and 1995/96.
The ceilings for the two years - Pounds 253.6bn and Pounds 263.3bn
respectively - were agreed by the cabinet last autumn and re-affirmed in Mr
Norman Lamont's March Budget. They imply small cuts in overall expenditure
once inflation has been taken into account.
In an attempt to hold the line earlier this year Mr Portillo asked
colleagues to abandon the traditional practice of bidding for extra cash and
to provide the Treasury with options for cuts of between 2.5 and 5 per cent.
But ministers said the home office and social security, health, education,
environment, and transport departments - which account for more than
three-quarters of all spending - have rejected any budget reductions.
Instead they have submitted additional bids which one senior Whitehall
official said ran into 'many billions'. The treasury has set aside a Pounds
7bn contingency reserve for unforeseen expenditure in 1994/95 but only half
can be allocated during the summer.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 30m orders won by Taylor
Woodrow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Three new contracts won by TAYLOR WOODROW companies for facilities

total value of current projects by the group in this sector to nearly Pounds
30m.
One of the latest is a Pounds 6m contract for works services management at
three naval bases in the Plymouth area, won by Taylor Woodrow Management
(TWM).
Another, worth Pounds 1.3m, was won by Taylor Woodrow Construction Southern

2.2m of building work at RAF Northolt, was won by Myton, a subsidiary of the
Taylor Woodrow group.
Work on TWM' s three-year management contract is under way at the Royal
Naval Engineering College at Manadon, HMS Raleigh training base, and the
Royal Naval Gunners' School at HMS Cambridge.
TWM also has a three-year works services management contract worth Pounds 7m
for two facilities in Portsmouth - the Royal Naval Hospital, Haslar, and
Fort Monckton.
The 18-month contract to refurbish the junior ranks mess at RAF Brize Norton
near Witney in Oxfordshire, has begun. TWCS is also undertaking a similar
refurbishment project at Castlemartin army training camp in Pembrokeshire,

FT  21 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI climbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ahead of its demerger, ICI rose 11 to 1260p as the group announced that the
sale of its European polypropylene arm to BASF, of Germany, would not be
referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Nevertheless, the enthusiasm remained with the chemicals side. The initial
gulf between ICI 'new' and the bioscience arm Zeneca, which have been traded
in the officially sanctioned 'grey' market, was closed up yesterday. ICI
'new' rose 121 to 630p, while Zeneca ex-rights closed at the same level and
Zeneca nil-paid lost a penny to 39p.
Tobacco and insurance group BAT Industries recovered some of its recent
fall, ending 12 up at 834 1/2 p.
Results from Storehouse came in at the top end of expectations, although
recent reports from the retail trade had indicated the rising strength in
high street sales and the shares reacted mildly. They closed 2 adrift at
199p.
The retirement of Sir Bernard Ashley from the board of Laura Ashley
coincided with the sale of a large chunk of his stake in the clothing group.
Close on 30m shares were placed by Kleinwort Benson and Robert Fleming at
108p with institutions, according to dealers. The stock closed a penny off
at 112p.
Bearish comment and marketmakers' short positions combined to send
Kingfisher down 15 to 592p. James Capel was said to be negative over the
French retailer Darty.
Brent Chemicals fell 30 to 99p after announcing sales and margins for the
first four months of the year that were well below expectations. The group
added that its first half profits would be significantly below last year's
figure.
The details highlighted the dire performance of the chemicals industry in
mainland Europe and companies with exposure to the area also saw their share
price totter. Burmah closed 3 lower at 706p after being up in early trading.
Regional electricity shares made strong progress as investors focused on the
prospect of 10 per cent-plus rises in dividends during the preliminary
reporting season.
Double-figure rises were common throughout the sector, with Northern
Electricity the best performer and finally 13 higher at 501p, closely
followed by Southern, the only FT-SE 100 stock in the sector, which closed
10 1/2 up at 459 1/2 p. Eastern was a similar amount better at 462 1/2 p and
South West gained 10 at 482p.
Scottish Power moved forward 5 to 315p on good turnover of 4.1m after the
company delivered a 10 per cent increase in the dividend along with
satisfactory preliminary figures.
British Gas closed 1 1/2 higher at 294p after first-quarter figures towards
the top end of the range of forecasts. Bears continued to point to the
outcome of the MMC inquiry, while bulls said the market had possibly
overlooked the profit potential of an aggressive cost exercise at the
company.
Media stocks performed well yesterday, with suggestions that US domestic
funds had been buying selectively. That interest, often in tight markets,
was helped by some specific factors.
Watmoughs, the design to packaging group, rose 5 to 665p after saying it was
renewing a magazine production contract. Ferguson International, which
supplies products and services to the retail and communications industries,
added 18 at 323p on encouraging results. Dorling Kindersley, the publisher,
recovered from recent profit-taking, bouncing 7 to 267p, and Haynes
Publishing was lifted 15 to 323p. Among the larger groups, United Newspapers
rose 7 to 595p and Reuters 12 to 1276p.
Celestion, the clothing and hi-fi group which was transmuted into Magellan
at its agm on Monday, put on 13 at 166p. The company was featured at a
smaller companies exhibition hosted yesterday by its joint broker Hoare
Govett.
Cookson Group moved 3 1/2 ahead to 199 1/2 p after NatWest Securities urged
investors to switch out of ECC following a forecast cut on Wednesday. Mr
Geoff Allum at the house said: 'Earnings at Cookson are likely to continue
growing over the next two years, whereas earnings at China Clays remain
under pressure.' Bargain hunters helped ECC claw back some of Wednesday's
losses and the shares ended 5 up at 438p.
Hopes of disposals at Cannon Street Investments boosted the shares and they
finished 2 better at 26p. A favourable annual meeting and reports of a
recommendation from Kleinwort Benson boosted BTR by 5 to 590p. Some 4.4m
shares had been dealt by the close of trading.
The placing of Pounds 39m of convertible prefence shares in John Laing by
BZW went without a hitch, according to dealers. Laing 'A' closed marginally
higher at 266p.
Redland shares eased 2 to 492p in spite of plenty of good news on increases
in UK housebuilding and a 7 per cent jump in housing permits in Germany,
announced at the company's annual meeting.
A stock overhang depressed Siebe. The shares eased 6 to 461p, with Kleinwort
Benson and SG Warburg said to have been among the day's main sellers.
James Wilkes hardened a penny to 82p on the news that Suter, unchanged at
144p, had raised its stake in the engineering group to 15.3 per cent.
Further profit-taking in Rolls-Royce saw the shares slip 2 1/2 to 145p on
turnover of 3.1m.

FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Crabtree gains listing via Pounds 19m move
into Somerset
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRABTREE Holdings, a supplier of metal decorating printing presses, coaters
and sheet metal feeders, is coming to the stock market via the Pounds 19.4m
reverse takeover of Somerset Trust.
Shares in Somerset, formerly the Children's Medical Charity Investment
Trust, were suspended at 178p on May 4.
The consideration consists of Pounds 5m in shares to the vendors, Pounds
8.4m in loan notes and Pounds 6m cash.
To fund this, a placing by Credit Lyonnais Laing of 6.67m new 10p ordinary
Somerset shares at 150p apiece to raise Pounds 10m has been proposed, along
with a 3-for-1 rights issue, underwritten by Hill Samuel Bank, of 3.6m new
10p ordinary shares at 150p to raise Pounds 5.4m.
Of the Pounds 14.7m raised, after expenses, Pounds 14.4m will finance the
acquisition. The balance with be used to cut borrowings and increase working
capital.
It is also proposed that Somerset's existing shares of Pounds 1 be
subdivided into one 10p ordinary and one 90p deferred. Furthermore,
Somerset's name is to be changed to Crabtree Group. Shareholders' approval
for these proposals will be sought at an egm on June 21.
Somerset also yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 35,000 (Pounds
39,000) for 1992, after exceptional charges of Pounds 6,000. Income from
fixed net assets was Pounds 49,000 (Pounds 55,000).

FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Starmin offers enhanced scrip 50% higher
than dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STARMIN, the Guildford-based quarry products group, has joined the growing
trend for proposing enhanced scrip dividends to ease the company's
unrelieved advance corporation tax situation and conserve cash resources.
The scrip offer is worth 30p per 100 shares, a 50 per cent improvement on
the unchanged cash dividend of 0.3p including a recommended maintained final
payment of 0.2p.
Although Starmin now operates mainly in the UK the unrelieved ACT arose from
the companies in the group when the Abdullah brothers bought into it in 1989
following their departure from Evered, and the operations of acquisitions.
Mr Raschid Abdullah, chief executive, added that cash conservation was as
important a reason as the ACT. 'Although smaller companies are returning to
fashion raising funds is still difficult,' he said.
In the 1992 year the company reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 8.06m,
compared with profits of Pounds 1.94m. The maintenance of the dividend was
based on the company's prospects, which the board viewed with a little more
confidence than at the interim stage.
In the current year there had been some signs of increased activity and a
satisfactory result in the first three months. But the company warned that
the recovery would be slow and difficult.
The pre-tax figure was achieved after exceptional charges of Pounds 9.21m
(Pounds 924,000) relating to reorganisation and restructuring costs less
earlier provisions and property sale profits.
Of the pre-exceptional profits of Pounds 1.87m (Pounds 3.38m) Pounds 2.24m
(Pounds 3.35m) related to continuing operations. Turnover was static at
Pounds 20.1m (Pounds 20m) and losses per share came out at 2.5p against
earnings of 0.5p.
Mr Abdullah said that the company had taken a cautious view of the year and
was one of the reasons for the delay in publishing the results.
At the annual meeting Mr Owen Rout is being replaced as chairman by Lord
Parkinson, the present deputy.

FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Brent Chemicals warns of downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Brent Chemicals, the speciality chemicals group, shed nearly a
quarter of their value yesterday after the chairman said sales and margins
had been hit in the first four months of trading.
Lord Lane, chairman, told shareholders at the AGM that he expected profits
for the first half to be 'significantly below' those achieved in the same
period in 1992.
The shares closed down 30p at 99p.
City analysts were shocked at the comprehensive nature of what amounted to a
profits warning. The statement appeared to show not only a turn down in
business in continental Europe and the UK, but also in the US.
It was also a marked contrast to the statement made by the chairman at the
time of the 1992 results. In late March, Lord Lane was acknowledging tough
trading conditions but talking confidently to the City about the future.
Lord Lane said yesterday that after a promising start, sales in the US had
recently slowed, particularly in the aerospace-linked field, and sales in
the UK industrial metal finishing had continued to weaken.
Germany had produced profits below those for the same period last year,
although they were still 'healthy' and cash flow was strong.
Elsewhere in continental Europe, the company was experiencing 'difficult
market conditions.'

FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: SBC to issue 5m covered call warrants on
BAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWISS BANK Corporation is to issue 5m covered call warrants on BAT
Industries, the financial services and tobacco group, which is likely to
earn the bank a healthy profit on its purchase of the shares through BAT's
recent scrip issue.
SBC will sell the covered call warrants through its retail network. The
warrants give holders the right to buy the underlying shares at a set price
during a set period.
Like other large Swiss banks, SBC is known for its retail placement ability
in Switzerland, where investors are strongly influenced by banks' 'buy'
lists. BAT shares are recommended as a long-term and short-term buy by SBC.
SBC expects to own about 10m BAT shares, after offering to pay holders 2 per
cent less than the market price for the shares issued as a scrip dividend,
undercutting Barclays de Zoete Wedd's offer of a 5 per cent discount. The
scrip dividend scheme was devised by BZW for BAT for tax reasons.
The call price - that is, the price at which warrant holders can buy the
shares - is set at 835p, yesterday's closing price.
Each warrant costs 110p, which represents a premium of 13.1 per cent over
the share price and can be exercised at any time from June 8, 1993 to
November 25, 1994.
SBC bought the shares at 816.66p so stands to make a profit if the warrants
are exercised. Even if the warrants are not exercised, SBC has knocked 55p
off the cost of holding each share if it sells 5m warrants at 110p each.

FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Ferguson doubles to Pounds 9.7m as managing
director resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FERGUSON International Holdings, the printing and publishing group, almost
doubled pre-tax profits to Pounds 9.7m in the year to February 28. The
advance from Pounds 4.9m was thanks partly to flattering comparisons under
the FRS 3 accounting rules.
The company, whose shares closed up 18p at 323p, also announced the
resignation by 'mutual consent' of Mr Michael Saint as group managing
director.
Having managed the refocusing of the company over the past three years, Mr
Saint said it was time to move on. A successor would be announced later, the
company said.
Underlying profit growth was 28 per cent after stripping out exceptional
costs for the closure of loss-making operations, disposals and
restructuring. These were a net Pounds 849,000 this time and Pounds 3.3m a
year earlier.
Operating profits on continuing activities rose 25 per cent to Pounds 11.4m.
Interest charges fell to Pounds 777,000 (Pounds 1.1m) while gearing was
reduced to 15.1 per cent (25.1 per cent).
The clothing hangers division was the only one to show a fall in operating
profits to Pounds 2.47m (Pounds 2.63m) on improved turnover of Pounds 31.5m
(Pounds 31.1m).
The company's biggest business, labels, improved margins and contributed
Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 4.4m) on turnover of Pounds 58.1m (Pounds 51.8m).
Communications components improved profits to Pounds 1.67m (Pounds 1.56m) on
turnover of Pounds 20.5m (Pounds 16.8m).
Printing and publishing raised its input to Pounds 533,000 (Pounds 493,000)
on turnover of Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 10.5m) and took a small loss on
discontinued operations.
Turnover from continuing operations rose to Pounds 121m (Pounds 110m). The
proposed unchanged final dividend of 8.25p maintains the total at 12.5p, out
of earnings per share of 19.5p (16.5p)

FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Laing seeks Pounds 39m in placing - Funds
needed for privately-financed infrastructure projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN LAING, one of Britain's biggest construction groups, is raising Pounds
39m, part of which will be used to invest in privately-financed European
infrastructure projects.
The company is a member of joint ventures bidding to construct a
privately-financed road toll bridge across the Firth of Forth in Scotland
and a toll bridge across the river Tagus in Lisbon, Portugal.
It is currently building a toll bridge across the river Severn, between
England and Wales, in the joint venture with GTM Entrepose, the French
construction group.
Laing is raising the cash through a placing and offer to shareholders of
40.2m of 6.4 per cent convertible cumulative preference shares. The issue is
being handled by Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Shareholders are being offered 9
convertible shares at Pounds 1 each for every 20 ordinary shares held.
The company, which made a Pounds 11.6m pre-tax profit last year following a
Pounds 65.3m loss in 1991, says it needs the money to increase its
involvement in private infrastructure projects.
It will also be used to to expand Laing's overseas contracting business,
particularly in the Far East and to expand its private housebuilding
operations from south-east England, where it currently operates, into the
Midlands.
Laing says it is also looking at opportunities in continental Europe through
its recently formed Societe Europeenne de Construction joint venture with
GTM Entrepose of France, NCC of Sweden and Strabag Bau of Germany,
Laing had net cash of Pounds 34m at the end of April, but this excluded
Pounds 125m of guarantees, performance bonds and letters of credit which
increasingly are being sought by UK and international construction clients.
The group said that increased demand for performance bonds and the
requirement of a strong financial base to bid for private infrastructure
projects had persuaded it to increase shareholders' funds through a
preference issue rather than raise debt, despite its strong cash position.
Mr Martin Laing, chairman, said: 'The increasing requirement for contractors
to provide performance guarantees means that balance sheet strength is, and
will continue to be, a competitive consideration in securing new business.'
Performance bonds of up to 10 per cent of a contract's value mean that large
amounts of capital can remain tied up in jobs that have already been
completed, putting increased strain on balance sheets. A shortage of
construction work in the UK meant that customers have been in a much
stronger position to demand performance guarantees.

<TEXT>
HUNGARY vowed yesterday to recapitalise its troubled financial sector after
the disclosure in the Financial Times that loan losses at Magyar Hitel Bank
and Kereskedelmi Bank, the two largest commercial banks, had wiped out their
capital.
AV RT, the state holding company, said it would be ready to put proposals on
new capital for the banks it owns before the government's economic cabinet
in two or three weeks.
A World Bank-International Monetary Fund mission is then due in June to
discuss a broader programme to restructure Hungary's problem debtors as well
as to recapitalise problem banks, said Mr Teleki, chairman of the AV RT.
Mr Teleki conceded yesterday new capital was necessary but would not comment
on a recommendation by the World Bank for an infusion of Ft100bn (Dollars
1.1bn) to bring the capital adequacy of the whole banking sector up to 4 per
cent of assets on international accounting.
However, an AV RT official said that the World Bank was considering a
package worth upwards of Dollars 400m in structural adjustment and
enterprise restructuring loans to help put Hungary's financial system in
order.
Mr Teleki's comments came in an angry response to yesterday's publication of
data from a confidential World Bank document which revealed that Hungary's
top commercial banks were 'technically insolvent'.
Mr Teleki accepted that Hungarian banks did not meet international norms for
capital strength. But added: 'That is not the aim. While they are still not
privatised there is no point in them meeting international standards.'
Hitel Bank yesterday responded to the revelation of its technical insolvency
by stressing it remained liquid and stated that it had positive capital
under Hungary's, more flattering, accounting principles.
Citibank Overseas Investment is to lift its stake in Citibank Budapest to
100 per cent by acquiring a 20 per cent stake from the National Bank of
Hungary, Reuter reports from Budapest.
The Budapest-based bank earned pre-tax profits of Ft2bn in 1992.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Fall in demand hits Matsushita and Sony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MATSUSHITA and Sony, two of the world's leading consumer electronics
companies, yesterday reported sharp declines in pre-tax profits for the year
ended March as demand continued to be severely depressed in major markets.
They warned that conditions were unlikely to improve significantly in the
current year.
Both companies were also under considerable strain from higher depreciation
costs, including amortisation resulting from their acquisition of important
film studios in the US and from the yen's sharp appreciation in the past
year.
Matsushita, the world's largest electronics group, reported a 54 per cent
decline in pre-tax profits to Y168.4bn (Dollars 1.52bn) from the previous
year. Sales were down 5 per cent to Y7,055.9bn, while net profits decreased
71 per cent to Y38.4bn.
Sony saw a 57 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y92.6bn on sales up 1.6
per cent at Y3,993bn.
Net profits fell 70 per cent to Y36.3bn. The sharp fall was partly due to an
extraordinary gain from sales of shares in a subsidiary the previous year.
The 6 per cent appreciation of the yen during the period also had a
significant impact. Sony, which is dependent on exports for 66 per cent of
sales, said that the yen's appreciation had resulted in a Y154bn decline in
revenues.
For Matsushita, which has an export ratio of 36 per cent, the impact was
just Y7.3bn.
Both companies faced difficulty in the market for audio and video equipment.
Matsushita also saw declines in most of its other product areas such as home
appliances, electronic components and entertainment. The group was hit by
restructuring costs for JVC, the troubled audio-visual affiliate, and by
costs relating to defective refrigerators sold by another subsidiary.
Sony said that in the past six months it had sold 240,000 units of the
MiniDisc, one of its newest products.
One area in which Sony did particularly well in contrast to Matsushita was
in the entertainment field. Sony's film division increased sales by 16 per
cent in yen terms and 25 per cent on a dollar basis.
Sony's music division, reported a slight decline in yen but a 16 per cent
increase on a local currency basis.
Meanwhile Matsushita's entertainment division, which includes MCA studios,
reported a 3 per cent sales decline in yen terms although this would have
been a slight increase on a dollar basis.
Both Matsushita and Sony are cutting costs to meet what they expect will be
continued weakness in their markets.
Capital expenditure has been nearly halved at Sony while Matsushita has been
reducing the number of product models it offers as well as other costs.
Matsushita is forecasting flat sales for next year at Y7,060bn on a
consolidated basis and a 25 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Y210bn.
Sony is forecasting a 2 per cent decline in sales to Y3,910bn and a 6 per
cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y87bn due in part to higher interest
charges.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime minister, said yesterday greater
European integration would be a priority when the country takes over the EC
presidency from Denmark in six weeks' time.
'It has to be said quite clearly that the best response to the political and
economic crisis we are going through is not less, but more Europe,' said Mr
Dehaene in a speech in Waregem, northern Belgium.
'That means, first, implementing the Maastricht treaty and, secondly,
ensuring (economic) growth in Europe,' Mr Dehaene, a Flemish Christian
Democrat, told a meeting of Catholic employers.
Mr Dehaene's speech is likely to create disquiet among Euro-sceptics in
Britain, which has yet to ratify the Maastricht treaty. They fear that
Belgium, backed by other enthusiastic EC members, will pursue a strong line
in favour of greater integration during its six-month presidency, especially
now that Denmark has voted in favour of the treaty.
He added that monetary union would underpin the European economy and
'finally put an end to competitive devaluations' of EC currencies, which
have put pressure on Belgium's export-based economy.
Senior Belgian ministers have suggested in the last week that the EC might
have to consider relaxing Maastricht's strict economic conditions for
monetary union, if the recession persists.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian authorities yesterday patched up divisions over proposals for
economic reform which are linked to a new Dollars 3bn loan from the
International Monetary Fund.
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the
central bank chairman, and Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, reached
broad agreement to make no new spending decisions for the rest of this year,
to increase interest rates, and to maintain quarterly limits on credit
expansion.
The agreement follows modifications discussed with the IMF. Earlier this
week, the measures were criticised by Mr Gerashchenko, who has deep
reservations about Mr Fyodorov's strategy for cutting inflation and
restructuring the economy.
Mr Gerashchenko told bankers that restrictions on credit expansion agreed
with the government would be overshot in the second quarter, not to mention
the rest of the year. He also challenged proposals for the rate at which the
Central Bank gives credit to the economy to track a so-called market rate.
But agreement among the three men is by no means the end of internal
squabbling in the Russian camp. The proposals for instance run directly
counter to the views of old-time conservatives such as first deputy prime
minister Oleg Lobov, in charge of the Economics Ministry.
Mr Fyodorov, who has sought to make the proposals as binding as possible for
his colleagues, said at the beginning of the week he expected the government
and Central Bank to make a joint pledge yesterday. But Mr Sergei Vasiliev,
head of the government centre to monitor economic reform, said the document
would not be ready until Saturday.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Italian interest rate cut to 10.5%
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Bank of Italy yesterday cut the discount rate by half a percentage point
to 10.5 per cent, the lowest level since 1978.
The move followed the positive outcome of the second Danish referendum on
the Maastricht treaty and is in response to calls from recession-hit
industries to ease the still high cost of borrowing. The rate cut is the
third this year.
Commercial banks immediately began to bring their prime rates into line. On
average the commercial banks looked set to cut their prime rates by half a
percentage point to 11.75 per cent.
The fall in interest rates, reflected in the reduced cost of financing the
budget deficit, brought some relief to the Ciampi government as the economic
team finalised measures for a mini-budget.
This could be announced today with a mix of new taxes and spending cuts
which are aimed at producing an extra L13,000bn (Dollars 8.8bn). The bulk is
expected to come from higher taxes, specially on petrol.
The mini-budget is also being planned in conjunction with the 1994 budget
which for the first time will be ready before the summer recess of
parliament.
Austerity is expected to continue with the need to hold down the public
sector deficit which remains over 10.5 per cent of GDP.
This week the government received another harsh reminder of the continued
demands on the Treasury. A constitutional court sentence has declared that
some 3.6m civil servants and members of the military are eligible to have
their severance pay on retirement topped up to accommodate inflation. The
court allowed parliament a reasonable period to implement legislation but
this will add at least L9,000bn in public spending.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Window on the west reopens: St Petersburg could be Russia's
Milan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNNLEY BROWNING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN tobacco companies are among the growing number of investors choosing
St Petersburg, Russia's former imperial capital, as the home base for their
operations in the former Soviet Union.
While most Moscow-based companies such as Coca-Cola, IBM and 3M have
representative offices in the city, other companies, including Procter &amp;
Gamble, Phillip Morris, RJR Reynolds and Gillette, have made St Petersburg
their CIS headquarters.
'St Petersburg could be to Moscow what Milan is to Rome,' says Mr Ruud
Wittkampf, St Petersburg manager of Ernst &amp; Young, one of six accounting,
auditing and consulting firms represented here. 'Rome may be Italy's
political locus, but Milan is its economic centre.'
Built by Peter the Great as 'a window on the west' nearly three centuries
ago, St Petersburg has long been Russia's most European city. With
geographic proximity to the west, a more co-operative bureaucracy,
architectural grandeur, a well educated population and military-industrial
enterprises ripe for conversion, the city has significant advantages over
Moscow.
Nearly half of about 6,000 foreign joint ventures in Russia are based in the
city. Gillette, which plans to build a factory to supplement its joint
venture partner Leninetz's existing factory, intends to make St Petersburg
one of the company's top three manufacturing points in the world.
Rothmans, which recently announced plans for a Dollars 90m factory, joins
tobacco concerns Phillip Morris and RJR Reynolds in establishing
manufacturing operations in St Petersburg.
Coca-Cola is also negotiating land agreements to build a bottling factory,
the first stage of a Dollars 34m project. Otis Elevator, which operated in
the city before the 1917 revolution, recently opened its manufacturing
facility and plans full production capacity and export to the rest of Europe
in 1996, while 3M is building a factory to make telecommunications products.
Western consumer-goods companies are marketing their products to an urban,
highly educated population in a city long considered the cultural and
intellectual capital of Russia.
St Petersburg's 5m population is the most highly educated in Russia; more
than half have university degrees; 60 per cent are of working age; one in
seven is an engineer working in military-industrial enterprises. The city
also provides a choice pool of highly qualified labour.
Mr Konstantin Karczmarczyk, director of Arctls, a Russian company involved
in the conversion of military industries, is less sanguine than those who
see the city as an east European hub. He says western companies looking for
manufacturing partners often find inefficient management and disastrous
balance sheets alongside high levels of quality and technology.
'Military enterprises have real visions of capitalism but the practices of
the old Soviet system,' he adds.
When joint ventures do materialise, they are not always happy marriages.
Gillette spent months in fraught negotiations with its partner Leninetz,
which promised to reconstruct an existing factory to produce 1bn razor
blades a year, but the project is believed to be long behind schedule.
Part of St Petersburg's appeal lies in its reputation as a city less
entangled in red tape than other Russian cities, and in the reputation of
its first elected mayor, Mr Anatoly Sobchak. He advocates tax incentives for
big business, private ownership of land, and banking reforms. He is the
architect of the Free Economic Zone project, in which tax breaks, abolition
of import/ export tariffs, and simplified joint venture registration
procedures would boost foreign trade and encourage manufacturing.
Popular opposition to Mr Sobchak is also growing. His critics say he pays
too much attention to western companies offering products few can afford
while neglecting housing, transport and other infrastructural problems and
failing to combat rising crime.
There are problems. Crime has risen significantly. Eight Marlboro kiosks
were firebombed recently for 'undercutting' the price of cigarettes sold in
stands controlled by racketeers, and Coca-Cola pays the taxi fare home for
its Russian employees, who are routinely harassed.
Businessmen also complain that property negotiations are hampered by
disputes over who owns what. Unlike Moscow, where gigantic Stalin-era
structures dominate the skyline, St Petersburg has endless rows of once
elegant 19th-century, Italianate buildings which will be prime investments
once the bureaucratic wrangling over property rights are overcome.
But despite the problems, life is starting to get easier. Satellite
telecommunication is now available, sales of centrally located privatised
apartments to executives are soaring, and the city's second five-star hotel,
the Nevskij Palace, is due to open soon.

SHARES in US Shoe fell sharply as the retailer reported a first-quarter net
loss of dollars 9.7m compared with earnings of dollars 2.8m. Net sales fell
1.1 per cent to dollars 640m, our New York staff writes.
The company said the losses were primarily due to the women's clothing
retailing division, which had operating losses of dollars 20.3m against
dollars 3.3m. A new president of these operations had recently been
appointed, the company added.
On Wall Street, the shares dropped dollars 1/2 to dollars 9, a 52-week low.

privatisation stalled

   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Greek government has abandoned plans to privatise Olympic Airways
quickly and now aims to restructure the state carrier, Reuter reports from
Athens.
'Let's leave out for the time the word privatisation. This is not the
objective. The objective is to have a viable company which will not depend
on government subsidies,' Olympic's recently appointed president, Mr
Emmanuel Fthenakis, said.
'(This) objective cannot be reached by going out and selling shares. I won't
do that,' he said.
The government decided in 1991 to sell 49 per cent of Olympic and give
management rights to the strategic investor. Officials had said
privatisation was going ahead, but investors showed little interest because
of Olympic's dollars 1.3bn debt.
'The short-term policy now is to keep Olympic from closing down. The
middle-term policy is to restructure it by writing off its debt and in the
long run the company could still be partly privatised,' a senior government
official involved in the sell-off said in an interview. 'But this
(privatisation) will not take place before the next elections,' he added.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With brand worries continuing to haunt food manufacturers, the fall in
Cadbury Schweppes was further fuelled by renewed rumours that the company
was about to launch a rights issue.
Although heard before, particularly in relation to a bid for United
Biscuits, rights hints have received fresh impetus from the recent spate of
issues by other consumer groups. However, while food analysts remain
sceptical, Cadbury has often emphasised its strategy that a rights issue
would only be contemplated for acquisition purposes.
Underpinning Cadbury's decline and general weakness in the sector was the
continuing fallout from comments this week from French food group BSN, which
have reignited recent fears over the vulnerability of food brands to
discount retailers. Among those to fall yesterday, Unilever retreated 18 to
996p, Hillsdown 8 to 139p, Cadbury 14 to 422p and Associated British Foods 5
to 469p. UB lost 2 to 403p.

FURTHER signs that investor confidence is returning to the property market
was signalled by improved results and positive comments from Chesterfield
Properties, and shares rose impressively across the sector. The Chesterfield
improvement follows more bullish reports from other property groups, most
recently Land Securities, the biggest in the sector.
Property analysts remain largely cautious towards the sector as a whole,
arguing that the selective nature of the recovery in property is mirrored in
the diversity of property stocks.
Yesterday, however, investors appeared keen on a wide variety of shares,
among which Chesterfield surged 58 to 330p, Bilton 16 to 531p, helped by
news on housing starts from Laing, British Land 11 to 302p, Hammerson 'A' 14

FT  21 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains wiped out at the close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRMNESS in sterling foll-owing good UK unemployment figures proved a
somewhat negative factor yesterday in a UK stock market no longer confident
that domestic interest rates can be reduced again in the near future. Having
been buoyed for much of the session by Wall Street's surge to a new peak
overnight, the London blue chips turned off towards the close. The FT-SE 100
Index ended a shade easier, contrasting with a sharp rise in the FT-SE Mid
250 Index, which broke through to a new closing high of 3,160.1.
London's response to Wall Street's rebound in the previous session was
somewhat disappointing. Although the Footsie gained 13 points in early
trading, dealers said there was little support behind it. The big
institutions were unwilling to buy stock at these levels, in fact a fairly
high level of Seaq volume suggested that some were selective sellers.
However, the market held on to its initial gains until early afternoon when
the combination of a firm pound and a dull Wall Street brought a sharp
reaction. The Dow Average was a couple of points off in UK trading hours
amid general nervousness ahead of today's Triple Witching Hour when a batch
of important futures contracts expire.
By the close, the FT-SE 100 was a net 2.9 down at 2,816.8. The contrast with
the FT-SE Mid 250, which gained 11.1 points, raised the perennial question
of whether the smaller stocks favoured by private investors lead, or merely
follow, the blue chip market. Some traders commented that the smaller stocks
which are included in the Mid 250 index were 'not always easy to sell' in a
market which has become increasingly nervous regarding economic prospects on
both domestic and international fronts.
Seaq volume increased sharply yesterday, totalling 700.8m shares compared
with 647.8m in the previous session. But non-Footsie business remained at
the slightly reduced levels of recent sessions, constituting only about 56
per cent of the day's total, against averages of around 62 per cent over the
past few months.
The market was undermined by the weakness in consumer issues which has
followed the disclosure of a fall in domestic retail sales last month. This
cloud over the progress of the recovery in the domestic economy has been
pressed home by disappointing results from the brewery sector and a lukewarm
reception in the stock market to the latest trading figures from Marks and
Spencer, the monarch of the high street retailers.
Renewed falls among consumer shares were accompanied by fresh hints that a
large takeover bid was in the air, and would perhaps bring the sizeable
rights issue of which the stock market is in fear.
At the same time, the London market lacked the lead from the big blue chip
sectors yesterday. Oil shares made no response to Wall Street's advance and
the pharmaceuticals sector also stayed in the shadows.
Several leading UK houses appeared to be avoiding taking on any big trading
positions in the international blue chips. The London market has become
nervous of the near-term outlook for the continental European economies in
the wake of this week's indications of inflationary pressures in Germany.

FT  21 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALK OF an impending rights issue, along with the availability of large
lines of stock in the equity market, depressed a futures sector already
disappointed with the lack of a further cut in interest rates, writes Joel
Kibazo.
Taking its cue from the strong overnight performance of Wall Street, the
June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened firmly at 2,837. But with
disappointment on the interest rates front still very much a feature, the
contract traded in a tight 10-point range for the rest of the morning, with
the favourable unemployment figures making little impact.
The availability of sizeable amounts of stock in the cash market led June
lower, with many of the big insitutions unwilling to buy the future. Talk of
a rights issue late in the day helped cause a sell-off that saw the contract
fall to the day's low of 2,815.
The usual bargain hunting helped June off the bottom and it closed at 2,818,
down 10 from Wednesday's close, with the premium to the cash market having
fallen to a mere two points. Turnover was poor, reaching 7,746 lots by the
official close.
In traded options, volume fell to 32,777. However, the FT-SE 100 and the
Euro FT-SE 100 options were busy ahead of today's expiry of the May index
options. They traded 8,762 and 6,331 lots respectively. Land Securities was
the busiest stock option with a total of 3,205 contracts dealt.

FT  21 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Late demand again propels Dow
to record

<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER spending most of the session in a narrow trading range close to
opening values, a fresh late burst of program buying lifted US stocks to
record highs for the second consecutive day, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 23.25 ahead at a record 3,523.28,
with most of the gain coming in the final few minutes of trading. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 3.02 stronger at 450.59, while the Nasdaq
composite was 7.00 higher at 697.43. New York SE volume came to 289.2m
shares.
The volatility and confusion of Wednesday - when an early 30-point fall in
the Dow was turned into a record-breaking 55-point romp in the wake of a
bond market rally and a sudden dip in gold prices - gave way to calm and
contemplation at yesterday's opening.
In spite of the new index highs, investors initially remained uncertain
about the outlook, although in the first few minutes of trading it looked as
if stocks were heading yet again into record territory. An early 14-point
gain, however, quickly disappeared as the institutional buying that opened
the day petered out.
The day's economic news was not good, helping to keep prices in check. State
unemployment claims rose by 7,000 during the second week of May, and the
Philadelphia Federal Reserve's index of local business activity fell. It was
not until the last 15 minutes before the close that stocks took off, lifted
by program trading related to today's expiration of stock and stock index
futures contracts.
Some of the market's recent leaders ran into profit-taking. Hewlett-Packard,
in great demand following good earnings news early in the week, receded
Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 87. AT&amp;T, at the forefront of the rally on
Wednesday, eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 60.
Other leading issues built on their gains. Walt Disney added Dollars 2 3/8
at Dollars 44. Gold shares, which saw heavy selling on Wednesday, were
firmer after a small rally in the gold price. Battle Mountain rose Dollars
5/8 to Dollars 9 3/8 .
Citicorp put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 28 3/4 in volume of 4.07m shares on
news that Mr Chris Steffen, former chief financial officer of Eastman Kodak,
is joining the bank's management team.
Canada
TORONTO advanced as positive sentiment about Wednesday's Ontario budget and
Wall Street's record-breaking run swept most indices higher. 'Banks were
better on the fact that they do not get slapped with a heavy tax,' a trader
commented.
The TSE 300 index ended 20.3 up at 3,831.6 and rises led declines by 392 to
301 after volume of 79.6m shares. The financial services sector climbed 30.6
to 2,930.5.

FT  21 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Wall Street triumphs over its fear of
inflation - The abrupt shift of sentiment that took the US market to new
highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Confusion, uncertainty, rumour and a touch of hysteria reign on Wall Street
this week.
There is confusion and uncertainty about where stocks, bonds, gold prices
and the economy are heading. There are wild rumours about what well-known
investment managers are doing with their money. And there has been a burst
of hysteria about inflation and monetary policy.
In spite of all this, US stock markets have managed to rise to record highs.
On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 55.64 to 3,500.03, an
impressive recovery from a morning which had seen it 30 points down.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index moved to within 10 points of its all-time
peak. Other market indices also approached, or broke through, their records,
in some of the heaviest trading ever seen on Wall Street.
The week opened with investors in a gloomy mood, fearful that recent news of
rising consumer, producer and commodity prices heralded the return of higher
inflation. The resurgence in the price of gold, a traditional inflation
hedge, had reinforced those fears.
The same worries had already undermined bond prices, sending the yield on
the benchmark 30-year government bond back above 7 per cent for the first
time in more than a month. This made equity investors even more nervous,
because rising bond yields make stocks look less attractive.
Both the stock and bond markets fretted that signs of revived inflation
might prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. The fretting
reached a peak this week because the Fed's open market committee was meeting
to review monetary policy. Pessimists feared that the open market committee
would put up short-term interest rates to head off a rise in prices.
When the committee meeting ended with no apparent change of policy, the
markets' mood suddenly brightened. Simultaneously, gold prices were hit by
profit-taking and dropped almost Dollars 10 from their Wednesday morning
high of Dollars 383 an ounce. The stage was set for a sharp reversal of
market sentiment.
As Mr Richard Hoey, chief economist at fund group Dreyfus, explained: 'What
we saw was a popping of the bubble of hysteria about accelerating
inflation.' He believed that stock market and bond market investors had
'built up a negative psychology based upon bad inflation numbers, the rising
gold price and falling bonds'. It was a fragile psychology which crumbled
easily.
First, bond prices rallied, bringing the yield on three-year treasuries down
from 7.07 per cent to 6.97 per cent. Then stocks turned upwards, heading to
new highs.
Rumours abounded. During the afternoon Mr George Soros, the well-known
investor who had helped spark the rally in gold, was rumoured to be
switching back out of the metal into bonds. Then word spread that Fidelity
Investment's huge Magellan fund had started to pour money into stocks in
anticipation of a big market rally. Neither rumour was true, but they
contributed to Wednesday's frenzy.
Other factors were at work. The most recent survey of market sentiment had
shown that investment advisers were more bearish about the market's outlook
that at any time since October 1990. To the professional investors, this was
an indication that the bears had exhausted their selling, and a sign that
the market was ripe for a rally. Many immediately began buying stocks.
Although the buying quickly petered out yesterday - at midday, bond and
equity prices were virtually unchanged - at least the fuss over gold prices
and inflation appeared to have died down. Mr Laszlo Birinyi, the veteran
market watcher with Birinyi Associates in New York, said: 'The whole gold
play was overworked. The conventional wisdom that gold is some sort of
harbinger of inflation is simply not true.'
Yet, the nagging uncertainties that were evident at the start of the week
had not gone away. While interest rates will probably remain where they are
for a few months, the next move in rates is more likely to be up than down.
Stocks still look pricey, and the huge inflows of investor cash (via mutual
funds) that has propped up prices for so long will slow down this summer
because of seasonal factors.
The recent performance of stock and bond markets has left Wall Street
feeling dazed and confused. Mr Birinyi is one observer who thinks that there
is more to the market's strength than just low interest rates and heavy
buying of mutual funds by investors chasing attractive yields. 'Maybe the
market is saying something major about the future. What it is, I do not
know.'

FT  21 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses fail to match
Eurotrack response
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL shares quoted in London offered a positive response as Wall
Street held its overnight gains, the Eurotrack 100 ending nearly a
percentage point ahead in the post bourse.
Where they were open on Ascension day, as in Milan and Madrid, senior
bourses seemed more subdued, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN remained at a 21-month high, the Comit index adding 0.68 to 559.17 in
strong turnover, on continued expectations of lower interest rates.
Mr Fabio Ferrando of Albertini in Milan believed that, given the continuing
strength of the lira, a half point cut in the discount rate was likely to
follow swiftly on the heels of agreement on a supplementary budget, expected
today.
Over the medium term, he thought that further reductions might be expected
when agreements are reached on labour reform and on the shape of the 1994
budget, which is due at the end of July.
Olivetti continued ahead, after the launch of its rights issue on Monday.
The shares rose L64 or 4.5 per cent per cent to fix at L1,474, before L1,470
after hours.
Mondadori, the publisher slumped L1,150 or 8.5 per cent to fix at L12,000
before rebounding to L12,500 after-hours amid profit-taking after the recent
speculation about a restructuring.
MADRID closed virtually flat, the general index closing 0.22 higher at
255.41, block trades keeping turnover relatively respectable at Pta18.2bn,
though well down from Wednesday's Pta28.6bn.
Tabacalera stood out in share price terms, rising Pta145 or 4.1 per cent to
Pta3,695 in volume of 335,436 shares, almost half of which was attributed to
block trades by brokers Asesores Bursatiles.
WARSAW shot up again. Of 17 stocks listed on the main market, 14 hit new
highs and the WIG index rose 254.1 or 9.2 per cent to 3,002.9, its sixth
record high in two weeks. Turnover was 345.8bn zloty.
Brokers said that the market was simply too small to soak up the sheer
pressure of buying at the moment. Meanwhile, the state-owned EL AL Israel
Airlines said in New York that it expects to be privatised soon and has seen
interest from financial investors in Israel and around the world.
ISTANBUL saw further profit-taking which left the 75-share index 105.07 or
1.3 per cent lower at 7,919.59 and 5.15 per cent down from last Thursday's
record high of 8,349.31.
Mrs Nur Pekin of Schroders in London noted that liquidity was being
withdrawn from the market as advance income tax payments totalling TL3
trillion fell due this week and next. Activity was also slowing ahead of a
week-long national holiday which begins on May 31 and amid rumours that the
Public Participation Administration, which is responsible for Turkey's
privatisation programme, was selling some of its holdings.
TEL AVIV managed a token recovery in thin trading after several days of
losses, the Mishtanim blue chip index closing 0.53 higher at 206.98 in
turnover of Shk182m.
DUBLIN recovered its momentum, led higher by financial issues, with the
central bank's cut in its short-term facility by 25 basis points to 8.25 per
cent widely expected. The ISEQ overall index rose 4.4 to 1,528.85.

FT  21 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Rumours spur Hong Kong
rally as Nikkei wavers
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EQUITIES settled lower as weakness in futures and small-lot sales erased
earlier gains in light volume. But the nation's revised industrial output
data for March encouraged a minor rally in late trading, lifting the Nikkei
average off its intraday low, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The Nikkei ended 50.40 easier at 20,330.39, after moving between 20,122.78
and 20,535.79. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 3.63 at
1,594.33. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 1.39 at 1,228.26.
Volume contracted to 350m shares from Wednesday's 397m and falls led rises
by 611 to 396, with 173 issues unchanged.
Brokers said Japan's revised output growth rate for March of 2.5 per cent,
up from 1.5 per cent, suggested that the domestic economy is improving and
encouraged some investors to buy back futures contracts during the afternoon
session. This, ultimately, aided the cash market.
However, the day's lower level of trading activity left the Nikkei
susceptible to waves of arbitrage-related sales, which put pressure on many
large-capital issues, brokers added.
Technical analysts predict that the market's weakness will pull equities
lower in the short term. Without government support through public fund
purchases, it is likely that the Nikkei would trade closer to 19,500, they
said.
Retreating gold prices in overnight trading prompted investors to take early
profits from Sumitomo Metal Mining, the recent market leader. It ended Y40
lower at Y1,120. Mitsui Mining and Smelting eased Y8 to Y550.
An appreciation of the yen against the dollar lifted regional power
suppliers. Kyushu Electric Power rose Y60 to Y2,940 and Chubu Electric Power
Y40 to Y2,920.
Individual investors continued to support companies with good earnings
results. Aiwa, the Japanese audio maker, climbed Y120 to Y1,490 on better
than expected earnings.
Some shipbuilding issues moved higher after figures from Namura
Shipbuilding, Y10 up at Y1,270. Sasebo Heavy Industries gained Y35 at Y594.
In Osaka the OSE average dipped 275.76 to 22,552.98 in volume of 17m shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets put in a mostly firm performance.
HONG KONG turned higher after rumours, later denied, of a resumption soon of
meetings of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group on handing over Hong Kong
to China in 1997.
Institutional bargain hunting helped the Hang Seng index to advance 25.08 to
7,118.96 in turnover down to HKDollars 4.28bn from Wednesday's HKDollars
5.43bn.
SYDNEY felt the effects of positive results in the banking sector and the
All Ordinaries index ended 1.6 up at 1,684.2 in turnover of ADollars 398.7m.
National Australia Bank added 24 cents at ADollars 9.46 after announcing
profits at the top end of expectations. Westpac Banking, which reported an
ADollars 204.6m interim loss, held steady at ADollars 3.61.
SINGAPORE retreated for the second consecutive session, with the market
failing to maintain record intraday highs set in early trade. The Straits
Times Industrial index eased 0.21 to 1,876.40, having peaked earlier at an
intraday record of 1,883.25.
Turnover was a record SDollars 847.46m, beating the previous high of
SDollars 740.65m seen on April 15, with continued heavy demand for Malaysian
shares.
KUALA LUMPUR extended its record-setting run, posting gains for the fifth
consecutive day. The composite index added 5.68 at 735.11.
NEW ZEALAND finished fractionally below its high for the year in active
trade, the NZSE-40 capital index gaining 11.54 at 1,627.45.
Telecom put on 7 cents at NZDollars 3.02 - its highest ever close - in
volume of more than 3.5m shares, in continued reaction to Tuesday's results.
TAIWAN fell 2.3 per cent as a wave of late selling left the weighted index
99.91 lower at 4,336.63. Turnover remained thin at TDollars 25.07bn.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Money Markets: More rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE central banks of both Ireland and Italy cut their official short-term
interest rates yesterday, as tensions continued to ease inside the European
exchange rate mechanism, writes James Blitz.
Denmark, Portugal, Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands have all eased
monetary policy this week in the wake of Denmark's approval of the
Maastricht treaty.
Yesterday, the Italian central bank joined this group, cutting its discount
rate to 10.50 per cent from a previous 11.0 per cent. A little while later,
Ireland's central bank cut its short-term facility rate to 8.25 per cent
from 8.50 per cent.
Yesterday's moves raised new questions about whether European central banks
might be able to cut interest rates without waiting for the Bundesbank to do
so first.
Mr Adrian James, an economist at NatWest Markets in London, said that a
crucial test of the structure of European rates will come on Monday when the
Bank of France operates in the money market.
The Bank of France's intervention rate - which effectively acts as its repo
rate - is currently at 7.75 per cent, only 15 basis points above Germany's.
Mr James says the Bank of France may seize the opportunity to push their
short-term rates below Germany's for the first time since their aborted
attempt in the winter of 1991.
One sign that the markets are at least expecting German and French
short-term rates to converge is that the June futures contracts for both
currencies' interest rates are getting closer together.
The Euromark contract closed at 92.78 yesterday, on very thin trading. The
French contract remained at 92.66 on a day when the Matif was closed for the
public holiday.
In sterling markets, there was a downbeat attitude towards rate cuts after
the April unemployment figures registered their third consecutive monthly
drop.
The September short sterling contract dropped 11 basis points at its low
point, but later rebounded amid sterling's strong performance against the
D-Mark on the foreign exchanges. It closed at 93.99, down 6 basis points on
the day.
In the cash market, the three-month deposit rate was unchanged at 6 per
cent. There was a large shortage of Pounds 1.7bn, and the overnight rate
peaked at 9 per cent.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: More pressure on the D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE weakening of the D-Mark inside the European exchange rate mechanism
continued to occupy dealers' minds yesterday, with sterling and the French
franc performing strongly against the German currency, writes James Blitz.
Although the Bundesbank decided not to ease any of its official rates this
week, the behaviour of market practitioners and central bankers might have
led outsiders to believe that there had been a significant policy easing in
Germany.
Yesterday, Ireland and Italy joined the growing band of European countries
who have lowered official interest rates in the wake of the Danish
referendum result - and in spite of the unchanged Bundesbank discount rate.
Their ability to ease policy was justified by the fact that no European
currency has weakened against the D-Mark in the wake of these moves.
Yesterday, the Italian lira closed at L910 to the D-Mark from a previous
L914.9. The Irish punt stayed firmly at the top of the hard core of
countries in the ERM grid.
However, the two most significant movers in Europe yesterday were currencies
whose central banks have left policy unchanged. The French franc closed
little altered, but again broke down through the FFr3.37 per D-Mark barrier
earlier in the day. The French currency's strength is that its central bank
has replenished the reserves used when defending its position in the ERM.
Sterling was also the beneficiary of powerful inflows of funds, convincingly
breaking through the DM2.50 barrier and ending in London at DM2.5100, its
highest finish since January 13.
The pound benefited from the third consecutive drop in the UK unemployment
figures, which took the market by surprise.
The dollar weakened moderately against the D-Mark yesterday, following a
powerful performance earlier in the week. It closed a pfennig down at
DM1.6135 in London, but it improved a little in New York to end at DM1.6155.
Although the D-Mark remains third from bottom of the ERM grid, a sharp fall
in its EMS divergence indicator - from minus 3 percentage points to minus 17
percentage points in the last three days - testifies to its weakness.
Thus far, the Italian lira has probably benefited more than most from that
weakness. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economic adviser at Bank of America in London,
believes that the lira now looks tired, and that Scandinavian currencies may
be the next beneficiaries of asset reallocation.
He points out that the European Community's finance ministers are meeting in
Denmark today and that a possible subject of discussion will be the
repegging of the Swedish krone and Finnish markka to the D-Mark.
The Swedish krone has been devalued by 20 per cent since its decoupling from
the Ecu last year, and the markka by 19 per cent.

THAILAND'S Agriculture Ministry will seek cabinet approval this month for a
special 500m baht (Pounds 13m) budget to be allocated to finance a
government effort to shore up weak rubber prices, reports Reuter from
Bangkok.
Mr Sanit Samosorn, director of the Rubber Research Institute, said the
budget, together with similar previous allocations, will enable the
government to buy 30,000 to 40,000 tonnes of unprocessed rubber.
He said the government fund was aimed at keeping the price of domestic
unsmoked sheets USS-3 at B17 a kilogram, compared with the present market
price of B15.50-16.00.
He said that the ministry would also ask the central bank to extend
short-term soft loans to private and state-owned agricultural co-operatives
to help them stock more rubber.
The concessionary loans will carry a 5 per cent annual interest rate,
compared with the 15 per cent commercial banks charge small borrowers.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rhodium plunge forces Westplats
to close shaft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLLAPSE of rhodium's price has forced Western Platinum, the world's
third-largest platinum group metals producer, to close a shaft at its
biggest mine in South Africa and to lay off 1,500 people or 10 per cent of
the workforce.
This was revealed yesterday by Mr Terry Wilkinson, Westplats' managing
director in an otherwise upbeat presentation to the Association of Mining
Analysts in London.
Mr Wilkinson pointed out the group put the shaft on care and maintenance
only to cut costs and to ensure that Westplats' borrowings did not rise
above the present R800m (Pounds 106m). Westplats' rhodium output, scheduled
to be about 50,000 troy ounces in the financial year to end-September, would
not be affected because production would be increased in other mining areas.
Rhodium, an essential material for some automotive anti-pollution catalysts,
raced up to a record Dollars 7,000 an ounce in 1990 but had fallen back to
Dollars 1,850 by the end of last year and recently fell to about Dollars 800
an ounce.
In its annual survey of the platinum metals market published earlier this
week, Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group, warned
that the recent rise in platinum's price was unlikely to compensate the
South African producers for the fall in rhodium and that production cuts
might have to be made.
JM suggested there was a small supply surplus of platinum last year but Mr
Wilkinson said his impression was that the platinum and rhodium markets were
in balance.
Westplats sells directly to only 14 customers - including Engelhard in the
US and Mitsubishi in Japan - and Mr Wilkinson said that there had been no
sign that they had been using rhodium from stock.
Westplats aims to produce 480,000 ounces of platinum this year and by 1995
expects annual production to include 550,000 ounces of platinum and 65,000
ounces of rhodium. Mr Wilkinson said the group's recent expansion had been,
and would continue to be, driven by demand from the small group of
customers. 'We would not put platinum into the spot market.'
He said that Westplats was 'over the capital expenditure hump' and needed to
spend only about R40m a year for some time. No decision had yet been taken
on various methods of reducing debt but a rights issue had not been ruled
out. Mr Wilkinson pointed out, however, that Mr Dieter Bock, new chief
executive of Lonrho, which owns 73 per cent of Westplats, had said that
Lonrho would retain at least 51 per cent of Westplats. Gencor of South
Africa owns 27 per cent of Westplats and has indicated that it would like to
increase its stake.
Analysts said that the positive tone of the presentation, during which Mr
Wilkinson said Westplats was the lowest-cost platinum metals producer with
the highest profit margins, implied the company was being readied for stock
market flotation.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Full capacity reached after
expansion at Bolivian open pit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ASSIGNED CAPACITY at Inti Raymi's Kori Khollo gold/silver open pit mine in
western Bolivia, which recently underwent a Dollars 163m expansion, has now
been reached according to Mr Alvaro Ugalde, the general manager.
The expansion of Karl Khollo was concluded in January. Inti Raymi is 85 per
cent owned by Battle Mountain Gold Company of Nevada. The remaining 15 per
cent is held by Emusa, a Bolivian mining enterprise. The expansion programme
will boost production capacity from 45,000 troy ounces of gold a year to
240,000 ounces. Silver capacity will increase from 250,000 ounces a year to
lm ounces.
Expansion was prompted by the exhaustion of the pit's 6m tonnes of
gold/silver oxide deposits. Exploration showed a further 60m tonnes of
sulphide deposits below, with a grade of 2.3 grams of gold and 14.5 grams of
silver per tonne. Following installation of a new carbon leaching plant, the
sulphide deposits are now being exploited. The recovery rate is 64.2 grams
of gold and 28.7 grams of silver per tonne.
Production of oxide deposit ceased in February. The production figures for
that month were 15,400 ounces of gold and 131,000 ounces of silver. Mr
Ugalde said overall production in 1992 reached 50,000 ounces of gold and
250,000 ounces of silver. Projected production for 1993 is 212,000 ounces of
gold and 900,000 ounces of silver rising in 1994 to 240,000 ounces and lm
ounces.
Funding for the company's expansion breaks down into Dollars 95m from
outside funding agencies, Dollars 55m from Battle Mountain and Dollars 13m
from Inti Raymi itself. Mr Ugalde believes a gold price of Dollars 330 an
ounce is necessary to cover interest payments.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Production to be doubled at
Amazonian gold mine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANHIA VALE do Rio Doce, the state-controlled Brazilian mining group, is
investing Dollars 20m to double gold production at its Igarape Bahia mine in
the Carajas region of the Amazonian state of Para. Last year, output from
the site was 4.9 tonnes.
When the new facilities come on line in mid-1994, CVRD's annual gold
production capacity will stand at 17 tonnes. The company produced 11.3
tonnes in 1992.
Brazil's overall production will probably remain about the same as last
year's 76.5 tonnes, however, predicted Mr Peter Rich, a consultant based in
Rio de Janeiro. CVRD's growth is likely to be offset by a drop off from
other mining companies. Some older sites are nearing depletion, and other
inefficient operations will be unviable unless the metal's current price
recovery becomes even more bullish, said Mr Rich. Multinationals cannot be
expected to invest unless there is a change in the constitutional
restriction on foreign majority ownership of mining operations, he added.
The expansion of Igarape Bahia is part of a programme designed to boost
annual production to about 30 tonnes by the year 2000, said Mr Francisco
Viveiros, CVRD superintendent of gold operations. That would make the
company 'part of the club of the world's biggest producers,' he noted.
If that sounds ambitious, it must be remembered that CVRD produced just 1.7
tonnes as recently as 1989. 'Brazil doesn't have a tradition of hard rock
mining, but they've performed miracles,' said Mr Rich.
To reach its goal, CVRD is investing about Dollars 40m this year for
prospecting and geological surveys, according Mr Viveiros. About Dollars 25m
of that is specifically earmarked for potential gold discoveries, with the
other Dollars 15m part of the general prospecting budget where gold is one
of several minerals sought, said the company official.
Some analysts are sceptical about the investment figures, but if they are
accurate, CVRD is spending twice as much this year in Brazil as all other
mining companies combined.
The company, the world's biggest exporter of iron ore, has been able to
gamble with gold and maintain satisfactory margins in an era of low prices
thanks to low production costs. It spent Dollars 200 to produce an ounce of
metal, less than the most efficient US and Australian producers, said Mr
Viveiros. Factors helping to reduce costs are Igarape Bahia's proximity to
infrastructure at the nearby Carajas iron ore site, and competitively priced
hydroelectric power.
Mr Viveiros stressed the benefits of a 'fly in-fly out' labour scheme,
whereby miners and their families maintain their permanent homes away from
the jungle site, decreasing infrastructure outlays, and cost-cutting
negotiations with suppliers of processing chemicals and other inputs.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bigger sugar deficit forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD SUGAR production will fall 2.84m tonnes below consumption in 1992-93,
according to Czarnikow, the London trade house.
The group's latest sugar review puts production at 111.6m tonnes, down 3m
tonnes from the last estimate in February, and substantially below last
year's 116.42m tonnes.
Consumption is now estimated at 113.9m tonnes, and 600,000 tonnes has been
allowed for what Czarnikow terms 'unrecorded disappearance'. The deficit is
well ahead of the International Sugar Organisation's figure of 1.61m tonnes,
announced earlier this week.
Mr Chris Pack, analyst at Czarnikow, said yesterday that the latest figures
showed a swing from last season's surplus to this season's deficit of 7m
tonnes.
'It is not surprising that the market has moved sharply ahead,' he said. 'It
is trying to find a new level.'
For most of the six months between last September and February, the New York
nearby raw sugar contracts were trading between 8 and 9 cents a lb. But as
perceptions increased of much lower crops than expected in Cuba, Thailand
and India, the market has risen sharply. On Monday the New York July
contract reached a high of 13.26 cents a lb before profit taking set in.
Yesterday in late trading it was at 11.98 cents a lb.
Czarnikow estimates Cuban production at 5.5m tonnes, on the high side
compared with other forecasters but still well down on last year's 7m
tonnes. Indian production is put at 11.5m tonnes, down 3m tonnes from last
year, while Thailand is expected to produce 3.8m tonnes, down from 1991-92's
5.1m tonnes.
Mr Pack said that now a clearer picture of production was emerging, the
market was looking for signs of demand, which has been restricted by the
higher price levels. 'This market is fundamentally driven,' he said, 'but
demand is a little cool for some of the rampant bulls to follow.'

FT  21 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: India lifts foodgrain
production target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDIAN agriculture ministry has raised its foodgrain production target
for 1993-94 to 188m tonnes, encouraged by indications that this year's
south-west monsoon will arrive on time and that rain levels will be normal.
Until recently the foodgrain production target was a subject of contention
between the Planning Commission, which suggested a figure of 188m tonnes,
and the agriculture ministry, which wanted it to be pegged at 183m tonnes.
In addition to the monsoon hopes, the agriculture ministry has been induced
to come round to the Planning Commission's view by a rise in the 1992-93
estimate from 177m tonnes to 180.3m. Few had expected that output would
touch 180m tonnes as the monsoon broke late and there was drought in many
parts.
The restoration of subsidy on phosphatic fertiliser in response to pressure
from the powerful farmers' lobby should make the increased production target
attainable. The south-west monsoon, begining in June, is crucial for India's
summer crop, which is bigger than the winter crop. Last year's summer
foodgrain crop amounted to 101m tonnes.
The Indian monsoon is considered normal if the rainfall is within 10 per
cent of 88 cm; last year it was 77.4 cm. The Meteorological Department will
this month issue a formal monsoon forecast.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sagging rubber prices put pact
in jeopardy - Next week's crucial meeting between producers and consumers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of the International Natural Rubber Agreement will be decided
next week when producing and consuming countries meet here to make one last
attempt to avert the collapse of one of the world's more enduring commodity
pacts.
The negotiations - under the auspices of the International Natural Rubber
Organisation - come at a time when rubber prices have slumped to their
lowest level in real terms for more than 30 years, partly because of
uncertainties about the future of the agreement.
'I just hope some compromise can be worked out,' said a delegate from one of
the consuming country members. 'When it comes down to it the abandonment of
Inra is in no one's interests - the producers are going to suffer the most
if it collapses.'
The early signs are not good. Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Sri Lanka,
Nigeria and the Ivory Coast, together accounting for about 80 per cent of
global natural rubber production, are on one side of the Inro negotiating
table. On the other side are the European Community, the US, Japan, China,
the Commonwealth of Independent States and some smaller consumers.
The producers see pricing as the main issue. They say that the agreement,
which has been in existence in one form or another since the late 1970s, has
not been effective in ensuring fair prices to rubber growers, particularly
over the last five years. Malaysia, until recently the world's biggest
producer, has seen its production fall in each of the last four years as low
prices have forced plantation owners and farmers out of business. The
producers say Inra must be renegotiated to give them a better deal.
The consumers, while recognising the difficulties producers are facing, say
that with the recession in much of the industrialised world, demand is weak.
'It's all about supply and demand, it's as simple as that,' said one rubber
trader.
The consumers - mostly the big tyre companies - say the immediate issue is
the failure of producers to abide by the terms of the agreement. They say
producers broke Inra rules by refusing to agree to a downward revision of
prices earlier this year. Until that issue is resolved there can be no
discussion of renegotiating Inra, which expires at the end of this year,
they warn.
Increasingly harsh words have bounced back and forth, with the producers, in
particular, making little effort to hide their anger.
Mr Lim Keng Yaik, Malaysia's minister of primary industries, has accused
consumer countries of not caring whether price levels are remunerative for
producer countries.
'We want Inra but not at any cost,' said Mr Lim. 'Producers must protect
themselves. They should not allow themselves to be trampled on by the rich
and powerful consuming countries.'
Producers have threatened to bring in their own pricing mechanisms if the
agreement collapses, setting export quotas for producer countries in an
effort to drive up prices. But producers privately admit that with a large
number of rubber deals now being concluded on a direct producer-to-buyer
basis rather than through an international exchange, such a system would be
very difficult to implement.
Producers face a further dilemma in that if the agreement does collapse then
nearly 200,000 tonnes of natural rubber stockpiled by its buffer stock
manager will start being sold on the open market, exerting further strong
downward pressure on world natural rubber prices.
This might all sound like good news for the consumers. But in the medium to
long term they would also face problems. Consumers need security of supply,
but if prices continue dropping then inevitably more producers will go out
of business and eventually world supply will contract. Furthermore consumers
cannot afford to lose sources of supply like Malaysia, which, with its long
history of rubber production, delivers high quality product.
Even in the short term the consumers would face difficulties if the
agreement was abandoned. Inra has provided some sort of global framework for
the rubber industry and, for all its limitations, a pricing guide. Consumers
do not relish a free-for-all in the rubber market, with all the extra
negotiations and paper work that would entail.
A Malaysian negotiator at the talks says that if what he calls enlightened
self interest prevails, then Inra might yet be saved. 'But there is a lot of
belligerence about. I'd put the chances of saving Inra at only about one in
three at best.'

Comex GOLD futures had rebounded by midday after early selling dried up, but
the market appeared to be looking for direction. 'We're at a key point here.
People are nervous about going long and about going short,' one New York
analyst said. Producer selling depressed the market overnight, although
buying out of the Middle East was seen providing some support. On the London
bullion market business was relatively quiet. Dealers said the market had a
more negative tone in the short term. 'One day it looks okay over Dollars
380, and then the next day, it looks bad Dollars 10 lower,' one commented.
COPPER consolidated earlier gains on the LME, and ended firmer, while other
base metals ended narrowly mixed after routine trading. Dealers said copper
benefited from short-covering away from Dollars 1,800 a tonne for
three-month metal, but did little to threaten the Dollars 1,850 target on
the upside. Three-month ZINC spent the day trading just above Dollars 980 a
tonne, where some support was expected. Dealers see the market building a
base above recent lows of Dollars 970.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts shrug off decline in jobless figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER and PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government bond market was not too perturbed about the possible
implications for inflation of the continued fall in unemployment. Losses
across the yield curve were small yesterday.
The surprise of a third month's decline in the jobless figures did raise
fears of impending pay pressure. Signs of anxiety about inflation showed
through in gains in the longer-dated index-linked stock.
However, a decline from 4.5 per cent to 4 per cent in the annual rate of
wage increases assuaged some of the concern, as did continued hopes of a
historically-low advance in the retail prices index, to be announced today.
Another cushion against inflation fears was provided by sterling, which
strengthened to more than DM2.51. The background remained cautious before
next week's auction.
A HALF-POINT cut in interest rates by the Bank of Italy, reducing the
discount rate to 10.5 per cent, sparked a late rally in government bonds,
with the BTP futures contract gaining about  1/4 point.
The cut came a day earlier than expected and confirmed the easing made
possible by increased confidence in the lira.
Among the high yielders, Spain was hit by profit-taking. Worst affected was
the five-year area, where a spate of buying had exaggerated the 'U' in the
yield curve, leading to the correction.
JAPANESE government bonds opened on a stronger note, helped by the yen's
buoyancy against the dollar and by a recovery in US Treasuries.
Nerves also steadied after the Bank of Japan squashed residual speculation
about a rise in interest rates.
However, there was little to give real impetus to the bond market, which has
started to look to next week's auction.
The No 145 5.5 per cent bond due 2002 opened in Tokyo on a yield of 4.625
per cent, compared with the previous evening's 4.665 per cent. It closed at
4.63 per cent. The September futures contract opened 20 basis points higher
at 106.28, and closed at the same level.
AUSTRALIAN government bonds firmed as currency regained some ground against
the US dollar.
The decline in the Australian dollar to less than 70 cents had been bad news
for the market because it wiped out hopes of an imminent cut in interest
rates. A half-point cut had been built into the short end of the market and
the resultant sell-off in that area had flattened the yield curve by as much
as 25 basis points.
US TREASURY prices were little changed in light trading yesterday as the
bond market caught its breath after Wednesday's wild fluctuations.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/32 at 101
7/8 , yielding 6.971 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was also down  1/32 , at 99 3/4 -to yield 3.992 per cent.
After Wednesday's remarkable late rally, when the long bond bounced back
from early losses to end sharply higher, dealers and investors stayed mostly
quiet. If anything, the market's mood remained on the bullish side, buoyed
by two sets of data.
First, the news that state unemployment claims rose 7,000 in the second week
of May reinforced the view that labour market conditions remain weak.
Second, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's index of local business activity
showed a sharp decline in May, further evidence that economic conditions
throughout the US remain patchy, spotty, with the economic recovery evident
in some regions, but not others.

FT  21 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Latin American corporate bond
fund to be launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAKING advantage of the increasing flow of Eurobond issues from Latin
America, a new dollar-denominated corporate bond fund is being launched with
an initial size of Dollars 50m to Dollars 100m.
The Latin American Corporate Bond Fund will invest in companies which are
'market leaders with first-rate balance sheets, but the wrong address',
according to Mr Audley Twiston Davies of Latin American Securities, advisers
to the fund. It will be set up as a closed-end trust with a 10-year term.
Most of the borrowers will be from Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela and
Chile, of which only the last has investment grade status from Standard &amp;
Poor's or Moody's, the two main credit rating agencies. The country rating
provides a ceiling on corporate ratings.
The International Finance Corporation, the private sector affiliate of the
World Bank, has said it will invest up to Dollars 15m in the new fund.
Mr Twiston Davies said the yield spread on the new fund was expected to be
more than 400 basis points over five-year US Treasuries, giving a yield of
about 9.5 per cent. There was also scope for capital gains as Latin American
countries and companies were re-rated.
Among Latin American corporate bonds, some Mexican issues have yield spreads
of less than 400 basis points, while the better Brazilian ones range from
450 to 500 basis points, according to one expert on the region.
Last year, Latin American borrowers tapped the Eurobond market with about 90
issues, raising nearly Dollars 10bn. Well over 100 issues are expected to be
made this year, raising up to 50 per cent more.

FT  21 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Moody's assigns B2 rating to
Kloster Cruise secured notes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOODY'S Investors Service, the US-based rating agency, has assigned a B2
speculative grade rating to the Dollars 300m senior, 10-year, secured notes
issued earlier this month by Kloster Cruise, a unit of Vard, the Norwegian
ferry and cruise group.
The coupon was set at 13 per cent and the notes were placed with a group of
'qualified' institutional investors, and secured against mortgages on two of
the company's 12-strong cruise ship fleet.
'The appraised value of the ships - Dollars 360m in aggregate - provides
only a slim cushion of asset coverage,' according to the rating agency.
Moody's said a decline in earnings combined with a heavy debt-service burden
had created a liquidity crisis within Kloster, the third-largest cruise ship
operator in the world. 'The company was in violation of covenants under its
key bank agreement and auditors expressed doubt about its ability to
continue as an on-going concern,' but doubt was removed, Moody's said, by
the financial restructuring.
Kloster earlier warned it will post a net loss in 1993. First quarter losses
rose to NKr88.2m (Dollars 12.8m) from losses of NKr17.4m in the same period
in 1992. Besides the issue, Kloster doubled its debt maturity profile to six
years from three years.
Moody's warned that Kloster faces new capital expenditures to strengthen its
competitive position and this may necessitate additional borrowings.
This year, Kloster will have to meet debt-servicing requirements of Dollars
230m while total interest bearing debt is estimated at Dollars 1bn. The
financial restructuring increased Kloster's annual interest payments by
Dollars 10m to Dollars 80m.
Moody's said Kloster may be forced to divest some of its cruise lines or
shift resources between lines to achieve economies of scale and pursue
market share as a result of aggressive expansion of larger and
better-capitalised competitors.
'Lacklustre economic growth could prolong cautious consumer spending and
dampen a recovery in Kloster Cruise's earnings and cash flow despite
historically stable and growing demand for cruise vacations,' Moody's
believes.

   THE asset-backed area of the international capital market
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
which has experienced a dearth of deals in recent months - saw the launch of
two new issues yesterday.
Goldman Sachs launched a Pounds 116m deal for European Bank Investment
Trust, which holds 20 per cent risk-weighted assets with Credit Suisse
Financial Products providing the cash-flow from swaps.
According to Goldman Sachs, investors have two lines of security - a
guarantee from Financial Guaranty Insurance (FGIC), and a pool of assets
which are senior fixed-rate sterling obligations from European banks with a
credit rating of AA-/AA3 or better. The bank obligations will consist of
bonds, letters of credit or loans and are procured in the market by a
specialist boutique. The structure is expected to be bought by banks,
according to the lead manager. One market participant commented that the
payment - of three-month Libor plus 0.2 per cent 'seems a bit tight'.
The day's other asset-backed deal came from Daiwa Europe which is launching
Dollars 100m of secured extendable notes for Grace 1 International, a
special purpose vehicle. These are secured by US commercial mortgages. The
maturity can be lengthened from 2001 to 2002 at the bondholders' option.
Elsewhere, Petrobras, the Brazilian oil group, launched its long-awaited
floating rate deal yesterday, offering Dollars 300m of five-year notes.
The notes are priced at 99.5 and have a coupon of six-month Libor plus 440
basis points. At the current level, that would mean a coupon of 7.775 per
cent and a yield of 7.82 per cent, according to lead-manager Chase
Investment Bank, although the coupon will not be set until June 4.
Mr Jorge Jasson, managing director with Chase's international capital
markets group, said Petrobras was keen to create a liquid benchmark in the
five-year area. 'The deal has had a warm reception as the market welcomes
floating-rate notes at a time when interest rate vulnerability is
increasing,' he said, adding that only a handful of emerging market names
have launched floating-rate deals.
Petrobras already has one floating-rate note deal under its belt, having
launched Dollars 140m of two-year notes maturing in August 1994. However,
the borrower was keen to test investor appetite for a bigger, longer-dated
issue.
Chase said the deal was priced with an eye on both the existing FRN and
other fixed rate issues in the market from similar borrowers. The existing
notes are trading at around 100.75, giving a yield of 365 basis points over
Libor, according to Chase, while other fixed rate bonds from Petrobras are
trading at 450 to 475 basis points over US Treasury bonds.

MATSUSHITA Electric Industrial, a leading manufacturer of electronic goods
in Japan, plans to issue Y200bn (Dollars 1.8bn) of straight corporate bonds
next quarter, the company announced yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo.
The company said it had not determined terms and conditions for the
borrowing, which is to finance the Y185bn buy-out of the company's
longstanding semiconductor joint venture with Philips Electronics of the
Netherlands.
The borrowing, which could comprise several issues, would represent a
sizeable tap on the growing corporate market. Companies have increasingly
been turning to bonds to raise funds because of the weak equity market and
because bank finance is more expensive.
Alcatel Alsthom, the Paris-based telecommunications and transport group,
said a ADollars 500m domestic commercial paper programme would go towards
working capital used throughout the Asia-Pacific region, Reuter reports from
Sydney.

FT  21 MAY 93 / International Company News: Sharp contrast in Australian
bank results

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTPAC Banking Corporation and National Australia Bank, the largest
Australian banking groups, yesterday revealed widely contrasting financial
performances for the six months to March.
The National consolidated its position as the country's most successful
major bank with a 25 per cent rise in net earnings, after extraordinaries,
to ADollars 507.3m (USDollars 362.3m), an interim dividend increase from 22
cents to 24 cents a share, and a 5 per cent fall in bad and doubtful debt
charges to Dollars A392.1m.
In contrast, Westpac reported a Dollars A204.6m loss, a halved interim
dividend of 6 cents a share, large new bad and doubtful debt write-offs of
almost Dollars A800m, and plans to raise a further Dollars A500m in
converting preference shares to top up its capital adequacy ratios.
Although still in the red, the latest Westpac result was far better than the
previous corresponding half, when the bank's property and other problems
first surfaced with a Dollars A2.7bn bad and doubtful debt write-off,
causing a Dollars A1.7bn net loss.
Property problems again bit hard into the latest Westpac result.
Non-property write-offs were reduced to a manageable Dollars A275m, but
revaluations of problem property assets caused a further Dollars A525m in
bad debt charges.
The Westpac result was also hit by abnormal losses of Dollars A178.3m
(Dollars A266.6m previously), including a Dollars A137m charge for
restructuring expenses.
The managing director of Westpac, Mr Robert Joss, pointed yesterday to
progress achieved by the bank towards recovery targets. He said operating
expenses had been reduced markedly and the company's earnings before
write-offs and tax had risen from Dollars A686.7m to Dollars A729.1m in the
half.
This reflected improved performances in the bank's Australian, New Zealand,
US and European operations and a return to profits by the troubled finance
offshoot, Australian Guarantee Corporation.
'The group's results will be largely influenced by the successful completion
of restructures now in process to reduce operating expenses and the effect
of reducing low-performing corporate assets, mainly offshore,' Mr Joss said.
'The adverse impact of non-performing loans has been diminishing.'
Westpac's gross problem loan portfolio eased from Dollars A9.72bn to Dollars
A8.57bn in the half. In contrast, the National's problem loans, although not
strictly comparable because of differing accounting practices, grew from
Dollars A4.25bn to Dollars A5.31bn.
The National's result reflected higher earnings from its Australian, UK and
Irish banks and a bigger contribution from New Zealand following the
takeover of Bank of New Zealand (BNZ) late last year. UK and Irish banks
lifted their combined contribution from Dollars A83.9m to Dollars A152.5m.
The Clydesdale Bank lifted its net contribution from Dollars A37.7m to
Dollars A65.8m; Northern Bank was up from Dollars A23.8m to Dollars A32.6m;
Yorkshire Bank rose from Dollars A45.8m to Dollars A89m; National Irish
lifted from Dollars A5.9m to Dollars A9.5m; but NAG (UK) increased its loss
from Dollars A12.4m to Dollars A16m.
The managing director of the National, Mr Don Argus, said the latest result
had been achieved without any significant upturn in economies where the bank
operates. He said profit before tax and provisions had risen by 10.3 per
cent to Dollars A1.24bn.
'Gains were generated through increased productivity, successful cost
containment, improved credit management and by the development of successful
new banking products targeted at key segments of the market,' Mr Argus said.
The National's total capital adequacy ratio was reduced from 11.7 to a
still-comfortable 10.8 per cent in the half, against the required Reserve
Bank minimum of 8 per cent. Westpac's corresponding ratio rose from a shaky
8.4 per cent to 10 per cent.
Westpac directors yesterday approved a request by the bank's newest major
shareholder, Lend Lease Corporation, to lift its Westpac stake to 15 per
cent. They also invited two Lend Lease executives, Mr Stuart Hornery and Mr
John Morschel, to join the Westpac board.
Meanwhile, the chairman of Westpac, Mr John Uhrig, announced he would resign
from the board of the bank's existing 15 per cent shareholder, the AMP
Society.

ONO Pharmaceutical, a medium-sized Japanese drug maker, announced a 21.2 per
cent increase, to Y36.3bn (Dollars 327.02m), in pre-tax profits for the year
to March. It attributed the rise to sales of new drugs. Net profits rose
15.5 per cent to Y15.5bn.
Sales grew 19.9 per cent to Y95.1bn as a result of solid sales of Kinedak,
its remedy for diabetes, and Vega, its anti-asthmatic compound.
The company is to raise dividends by Y6 to Y20 per share for the last fiscal
year in tandem with the increase in profits and sales.
The Osaka-based company expects pre-tax profits to climb 3.2 per cent to
Y37.5bn for the current financial year.
Taisho Pharmaceutical said pre-tax profits rose 1 per cent to Y54.3bn last
year. Net profits increased 1.5 per cent to Y28.3bn.
Sales rose 7.3 per cent to Y204bn against the last fiscal year, on steady
sales of antibiotic and new tonic drinks.

MATSUSHITA and Sony, two of the world's leading consumer electronics
companies, yesterday reported sharp declines in pre-tax profits for the year
to March as demand continued to be severely depressed in major markets. They
warned that conditions were unlikely to improve significantly in the current
year.
Both were also under strain from higher depreciation costs, including
amortisation resulting from their acquisition of important film studios in
the US and from the yen's sharp appreciation in the past year.
Matsushita, the world's largest electronics group, reported a 54 per cent
decline in pre-tax profits to Y168.4bn (Dollars 151m). Sales were down 5 per
cent to Y7,055.9bn, while net profits decreased 71 per cent to Y38.4bn.
Sony saw a 57 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y92.6bn on sales up 1.6
per cent at Y3,993bn.
Net profits fell 70 per cent to Y36.3bn. The sharp fall was partly due to an
extraordinary gain from sales of shares in a subsidiary the previous year.
The 6 per cent appreciation of the yen during the period also had a
significant impact. Sony, which is dependent on exports for 66 per cent of
sales, said that the yen's appreciation had resulted in a Y154bn decline in
revenues. For Matsushita, which has an export ratio of 36 per cent, the
impact was just Y7.3bn.
Both companies faced difficulty in the market for audio and video equipment.
Matsushita also saw declines in most of its other product areas, such as
home appliances, electronic components and entertainment. The group was hit
by restructuring costs for JVC, the audio-visual affiliate, and by costs
relating to faulty refrigerators sold by another subsidiary.
Both Matsushita and Sony are cutting costs to meet what they expect will be
continued weakness in their markets.
Capital expenditure has been nearly halved at Sony while Matsushita has been
reducing the number of product models it offers as well as other costs.
Matsushita is forecasting flat sales for next year of Y7,060bn on a
consolidated basis and a 25 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Y210bn.
Sony is forecasting a 2 per cent decline in sales to Y3,910bn and a 6 per
cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y87bn due in part to higher interest
charges.

<TEXT>
TORAY Industries, the leading Japanese maker of synthetic fibres, reported a
6.6 per cent fall, to Y48.2bn (Dollars 434.23m), in pre-tax profit for the
year to end-March. The result reflects reduced domestic demand, which led to
increased price competition and smaller margins in most sectors.
Sales for the year were down 3.2 per cent to Y580bn, with a 6.8 per cent
decline in fibres and textiles and a 5.5 per cent fall in plastics and
chemicals. However, new products and other businesses, including materials
used in sporting goods and pharmaceuticals, surged 20.6 per cent.
Sluggish demand for consumer electronics in Japan was partly responsible for
the fall in plastics and chemicals sales, while intensified competition in
the polyester film market reduced the company's overseas margins.
Consolidated sales slipped a marginal 0.6 per cent to Y970.5bn, while net
profit was down 3.1 per cent, as demand in east Asia for industrial
materials remained relatively strong.
For the current year, the parent is expecting a slight increase in sales to
Y590bn, but pre-tax profit at around the same level as last year's Y48bn.
Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals reported a 58 per cent plunge in pre-tax profits to
Y6.3bn, which it blamed on weaker sales of synthetic resins and plastics to
the car and electronics industries, and increased depreciation charges.
Sales were down 6.4 per cent to Y395bn.
Mitsui Toatsu plans to halve its dividend to Y3 and forecast another 20 per
cent fall in profits to Y5bn this year on sales of about Y390bn.
Mitsubishi Petrochemical experienced a 72.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profit
to Y8.3bn, as prices weakened for core products such as ethylene. While
sales volume remained flat, sales value was down 8.5 per cent to Y372.1bn.

FOSTER'S has signed a second joint brewing venture deal in China as part of
its push into the fast-growing Chinese beer market.
The Australian brewer's subsidiary, Carlton and United Breweries, signed a
USDollars 7m agreement with the state-owned Princess Brewery in Guangdong
province, south China.
Foster's executives expect to invest about USDollars 140m by the end of this
century in a network of breweries in China.
The Guangdong brewery, at Doumen near the Portuguese enclave of Macao, will
be upgraded, and a second brewery built later. Carlton and United Breweries
expects to be producing 300m litres a year at the Princess Brewery within
five years, compared with present production of 35m litres.
On Tuesday, CUB agreed a joint venture with the Huaguang brewery, one of
Shanghai's leading brewers. It expects to sign a further agreement soon with
a brewer in northern China, and anticipates that within five years it will
be producing more beer in China than in Australia.
Foster's expects China to displace the US as the world's biggest beer market
by the end of the century.

CERAMCO, the biggest lingerie maker in Australasia, yesterday announced
operating profits after tax for the year to March 31 up from NZDollars 16.7m
(USDollars 9.3m) to NZDollars 19.3m. Total profits for the year, after an
extraordinary profit of NZDollars 7m, were up 61 per cent to NZDollars 26.3m
from NZDollars 16.6m.
Directors said they expected continuing improvements in earnings and in the
group's financial position.
The results include trading profits of NZDollars 851,000 from the sale of
two subsidiaries outside of its key interests of clothing and exporting
china clays. Directors said both these activities were well placed in the
international market with high cash-flows and export growth potential.
During the year, Ceramco sold its interests in Steel and Tube Holdings,
realising NZDollars 32.5m, a surplus of NZDollars 3.7m over the written-down
book value. It also eliminated all debt from the balance sheet and had
NZDollars 4.5m in cash on deposit at the year's end.
It had also repaid to shareholders half the company's paid-up capital, or
NZDollars 24.2m, and cancelled 48.4m shares. Operating revenue was NZDollars
163m, compared with NZDollars 133m.

margins at Toray

TORAY Industries, the leading Japanese maker of synthetic fibres, reported a
6.6 per cent fall, to Y48.2bn (Dollars 434.23m), in pre-tax profit for the
year to end-March. The result reflects reduced domestic demand, which led to
increased price competition and smaller margins in most sectors.
Sales for the year were down 3.2 per cent to Y580bn, with a 6.8 per cent
decline in fibres and textiles and a 5.5 per cent fall in plastics and
chemicals. However, new products and other businesses, including materials
used in sporting goods and pharmaceuticals, surged 20.6 per cent.
Sluggish demand for consumer electronics in Japan was partly responsible for
the fall in plastics and chemicals sales, while intensified competition in
the polyester film market reduced the company's overseas margins.
Consolidated sales slipped a marginal 0.6 per cent to Y970.5bn, while net
profit was down 3.1 per cent, as demand in east Asia for industrial
materials remained relatively strong. For the current year, the parent is
expecting a slight increase in sales to Y590bn, but pre-tax profit at around
the same level as last year's Y48bn.
Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals reported a 58 per cent plunge in pre-tax profits to
Y6.3bn, which it blamed on weaker sales of synthetic resins and plastics to
the car and electronics industries, and increased depreciation charges.
Sales were down 6.4 per cent to Y395bn.
Mitsui Toatsu plans to halve its dividend to Y3 and forecast another 20 per
cent fall in profits to Y5bn this year on sales of about Y390bn.
Mitsubishi Petrochemical experienced a steep 72.7 per cent fall in pre-tax
profit to Y8.3bn, as prices weakened for core products such as ethylene.
While sales volume remained flat, sales value was down 8.5 per cent to
Y372.1bn, and is expected to remain at the same level this year. Pre-tax
profit is forecast to slip to Y4bn.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BANK of New Zealand yesterday announced an unaudited operating tax-paid
profit of NZ134.6m (USDollars 74.8m) for the year to March 31, which the new
owners, National Bank of Australia, said was in line with expectations.
The result is not comparable with last year's profit of NZDollars 172m as
NAB changed the company's accounting policies in November when it bought the
bank for NZDollars 1.45bn. It said then that the changes were being made to
reflect its own accounting and provisioning policies. This led to an
abnormal item of NZDollars 277.2m after tax. If the abnormal item is
included, BNZ made a loss of NZDollars 151.3m.
The managing director, Mr Bob Prowse, said the results reflected reduced
income from treasury-related activities such as securities and foreign
exchange trading, where the bank was adopting a more cautious approach. He
said trading margins had tightened significantly during late 1992 and early
1993.

for the 12 months to March, up from Rs1.15bn the year before, bucking the
country's general trend of falling profits.
Sales rose by a quarter, to Rs38.09bn, mostly due to strong growth in the
tobacco business. After provisions, net profits rose by more than a third to
Rs1.55bn.
Earnings per share rose to Rs13.30 from Rs9.87, reversing the fall in the
previous year.

FT  21 MAY 93 / International Company News: Parametric looks to Asia for
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARAMETRIC TECHNOLOGY, one of the fastest-growing high-technology companies
in the US, has begun a big expansion into Asia to tap the market for its
mechanical Cadcam (computer-aided design and manufacturing) software.
The Massachusetts-based Parametric, founded in 1985 and valued at about
Dollars 1bn on Wall Street, has been rapidly developing its operations in
Europe over the past two years. But in recent months it has stepped up its
Asian presence, opening direct sales offices to complement existing
distribution arrangements.
Mr Louis Volpe, vice-president for marketing and operations, said in London
that Parametric wanted to achieve a broad balance between its US, European
and Asian sales over the next 10 years.
With turnover doubling in the US each year, this would imply even faster
growth in Europe and Asia.
Parametric sees Japan as its biggest market in Asia. Along with other Cadcam
vendors, it is keen to exploit the Japanese move from two-dimensional to
three-dimensional mechanical design, which is occurring rather later than in
Europe and the US.
But Mr Volpe said Chinese companies had expressed much interest in its
products. It had also just received the largest-ever Cadcam order from an
Indian company, Tata Engineering and Locomotive.
In Europe, Parametric is targeting electronics packaging and automotive
companies. It is hoping to use its new Pro/Dieface software for complex
body-panels as a way into the European automotive market.
Parametric's sales surged from Dollars 11m in 1989 to Dollars 86.7m last
year due to the popularity of its Pro/Engineer family of software products
and their applicability to a number of different workstations.
Net earnings over the same period rose from Dollars 2.24m to Dollars 21.1m.
The company said in April its second-quarter earnings rose 109 per cent to
Dollars 9.8m.

MR Bob Crandall, chairman of American Airlines, says the US carrier has held
talks over possible partnerships with a number of European carriers,

Speaking after his company's annual meeting in Texas, Mr Crandall said: 'We
haven't been able to structure a deal that makes sense for us and a European
partner.' However, he said talks were continuing although he did not specify
which carriers these involved.
Although talks in the past had covered equity investments, discussions under
way now were more about marketing relationships, he said.

INTRACOM, the Greek telecommunications equipment manufacturer in which
Ericsson of Sweden holds a 12 per cent stake, increased net earnings by 4.4
per cent to Dr6.6bn (Dollars 30m) for 1992 after delays in signing contracts
held up production.
Sales rose by 11.2 per cent to Dr33.8bn. They were led by the company's
expansion into eastern Europe with the launch of a computerised lottery game
in Russia.
Exports amounted to 16 per cent of sales in 1992, compared with 7 per cent
in the previous year.
Olympic Lotto, a Dollars 15m joint venture between Intracom and the Russian
Olympic Committee, uses hardware and software designed in Greece.
Intracom has also signed contracts with the governments of Ukraine,
Bulgaria, Romania and Moldavia to set up similar lottery games.
The company also exports specialised software, both for Ericsson's digital
switching systems and the GSM mobile telephone system, as well as equipment
for IBM personal computers manufactured in Europe.
The company forecasts that turnover will rise to Dr69bn this year following
the award of a Dr50bn contract to modernise the Athens telephone network
after several months' delay.
The turnkey project for OTE, the state-owned telecommunications operator,
will be partly funded by the European Community.
Intracom is also participating in one of two international consortia setting
up competitive mobile telephone networks in Greece. Both networks are due to
start operating later this year.
The company projects that investment this year will reach Dr7.5bn, focusing
on further automation and improving quality control.

MOLSON, the Canadian brewing and retailing group, says that strength in its
brewing and overseas special chemicals operations were more than offset by
difficulties in retailing and other problems in North America in the year
ended March 31.
The company reported a fall in net profits to CDollars 113.7m (USDollars
89.3m), or CDollars 1.90 a share, for the year compared with CDollars
126.2m, or CDollars 2.25, in fiscal 1992.
Sales and other revenues rose by 6 per cent to CDollars 3.1bn, from CDollars
2.9bn.
Including a special gain of CDollars 51m after tax from the sale by Molson
of 20 per cent of a brewing subsidiary to Miller Brewing of the US, total
profit for the latest year was CDollars 164.7m, equal to CDollars 2.76 a
share.
Mr Marshall Cohen, president, said that conditions were difficult in some
markets and management is taking corrective steps. Molson's brewing profits
rose 3.8 per cent to CDollars 167.6m.
The recession and a poor summer season were offset by higher prices and more
efficient production.
Molson Breweries is now 40 per cent owned by Molson, 40 per cent by Foster's
of Australia and 20 per cent by Miller.
The link with Miller would raise sales of Molson brands significantly in the
US, said Mr Cohen.
Operating profits from Diversey, Molson's special chemical business, rose 39
per cent, but its North American operations were affected by the recession
and problems with absorbing an acquisition.
Diversey's sales were flat at CDollars 1.3bn and operating profits fell 9
per cent to CDollars 70m but US operations are being rationalised and
European marketing strengthened, said Mr Cohen.
Hardware retailing was restructured and took a special CDollars 83m charge.
Molson's new Aikenhead warehouse store subsidiary reported a CDollars 9.9m
operating loss, but should be profitable this year.
It plans 28 stores in Ontario and western Canada by fiscal 1998. Aikenhead
is Molson's answer to the invasion of the Canadian market by Home Depot of
the US.
The sports and entertainment activities recorded a fall in operating profits
to CDollars 2.9m from CDollars 8.3m.

offshoot

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TELE-COMMUNICATIONS (TCI), the world's largest cable television operator,
has agreed to buy 49 per cent of Cablevision, the cable subsidiary of
Mexico's giant media company Grupo Televisa.
As part of the deal, TCI and Televisa will set up a joint venture to develop
cable and pay television in Latin America, including Brazil, the region's
largest television market.
The new company will benefit from TCI's advanced pay television technology
and expand by forming joint ventures with or buying up existing Latin
American cable companies, or starting new ones from scratch, Televisa said.
Mr Fernando Diez Barrosa, Televisa's vice-chairman, said: 'Together, Grupo
Televisa and TCI will build the Spanish and Portuguese-speaking world's
ultimate pay television system for information and entertainment. We will
deliver limitless product options on-demand into the living rooms of over
350m consumers where the growth of cable and pay television will be
explosive.'
Cablevision says it is the largest pay television company in Mexico,
although its main rival, Multivision, also claims this title. Last year,
Cablevision had 193,000 subscribers, with revenues of nearly Dollars 80m, up
40 per cent on 1991.
Televisa is the biggest and most powerful media company in the
Spanish-speaking world with revenues last year of Dollars 1.36bn. It has a
near-monopoly in Mexico and stakes in television stations in the US, through
Univision, the Spanish-speaking network, in Peru and Chile, and production
agreements in Venezuela and Argentina.
However, its dominance in Mexico will come under threat next month when the
government privatises two state-owned channels. The favoured bidding group
for the state channels includes the owner of Multivision.
In the US, TCI serves 10.2m customers in 49 states. It also has investments
in nine countries - including the UK franchise, Tele-West, in partnership
with US West. The Denver-based company has more than 1m international
subscribers, and other international joint venture arrangements have taken
it into Israel, Sweden, Norway and New Zealand.

MR RUPERT Murdoch's News Corporation announced yesterday that it had
completed arrangements for a revolving credit facility amounting to Dollars
3bn.
The facility is being provided by a 27-member banking group, and will permit
borrowings in US dollars, Australian dollars and sterling.
It has a final maturity date of June 1999 and, according to News
Corporation, the facility will cut the company's bank borrowing rates by 75
basis points.
The proceeds from the new facility will be used to repay News Corp's
outstanding borrowings under a Dollars 2bn 'override' facility - set up in
early 1991, with 146 lending banks - and a Dollars 901m stand-alone facility
for HarperCollins
The Dollars 3bn refinancing represents a further big step in the
restructuring of News Corp's debt. In late 1990, it was facing severe
financial problems with debts of more than Dollars 7.6bn.
The company held lengthy negotiations with international banks and after
months of talks, it was agreed that about Dollars 7.6bn of debt would be
restructured over three years.

FT  21 MAY 93 / International Company News: Fiat tightens grip on Italian
market

THE PURCHASE of the outstanding 51 per cent of Maserati for L75.8bn (Dollars
51.3m) has allowed Fiat, Italy's leading private company, to tighten its
hold over the domestic car industry.
Fiat bought 49 per cent of Modena-based Maserati, best known for its
expensive sports saloons, in 1989. The acquisition included 51 per cent of
Innocenti, the Maserati-owned maker of compact cars.
The agreement to buy out the remaining shares in Maserati follows the
illness earlier this year of Mr Alejandro De Tomaso, whose family controlled
the company via the New York-listed De Tomaso Industries concern. Mr De
Tomaso's continuing ill-health prompted the decision to sell out.
Maserati made about 1,000 cars last year, well down on its pre-recession
output of between 1,500 and 1,800 units a year. The company has been badly
hit by the slowdown in sales and is believed to have suffered rising losses
in 1992. Sales are divided almost equally between Italy and foreign markets,
notably Germany, France and Switzerland.
The seemingly high price for Maserati in view of its financial performance
may be explained by the inclusion in the deal of the company's former
Lambrate plant on the eastern fringe of Milan. Production at Lambrate ceased
recently and Fiat is expected to redevelop the site as a big new shopping
centre.
Fiat said the acquisition would not trigger any change in Maserati's
identity nor closer contacts with Ferrari, the prestige Fiat-owned sports
car maker also located near Modena.
Fiat's original investment in Maserati was expected to give it a new lease
of life. but, despite some limited financing, the investment had few obvious
benefits for Maserati. That may be explained by the fact that the stake was
purchased in the same year as Fiat failed in its bid to take over Saab of
Sweden and may have reflected a broader strategy of developing synergies
between Fiat's Lancia marque and Saab and Maserati.
By contrast, Fiat has had some success in developing Innocenti, which no
longer produces cars, as an additional brand for vehicles from its foreign
factories. Innocenti's Elba model is actually the station wagon version of
Fiat's Uno model made in Brazil.
GFT, the troubled Torinese clothing and textiles group, said talks on
selling a substantial stake to Miroglio, another privately-owned clothing
concern, had been broken off by mutual agreement.
The two companies said negotiations between them and with outside partners
had revealed 'considerable difference in the interpretation of and ways of
looking at methods of operation in the market'.

HUNGARY vowed yesterday to recapitalise its troubled financial sector after
the disclosure in the Financial Times that loan losses at Magyar Hitel Bank
and Kereskedelmi Bank, the two largest commercial banks, had wiped out their
capital.
AV RT, the state holding company, said it would be ready to put proposals on
new capital for the banks it owns before the government's economic cabinet
in two or three weeks.
A World Bank-International Monetary Fund mission is then due in June to
discuss a broader programme to restructure Hungary's problem debtors as well
as to recapitalise problem banks, said Mr Teleki, chairman of the AV RT.
Mr Teleki conceded yesterday new capital was necessary, but would not
comment on a recommendation by the World Bank for an infusion of Ft100bn
(Dollars 1.1bn) to bring the capital adequacy of the whole banking sector up
to 4 per cent of assets on international accounting.

FT  21 MAY 93 / International Company News: Warehouse clubs pay price for
wafer-thin margins - The gloom surrounding large discount stores in the US
as profits and sales recede
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER two decades of heady expansion, has the 'warehouse club' explosion in
the US come to an abrupt halt?
If so, what does this mean for the nation's large discount store operators,
who own many of these cut-price, no-frills retail barns, and whose 'everyday
low pricing' strategies have dominated the stores sector for the past few
years?
The worries are real. Only this week, K mart - in the process of reporting
an 80 per cent slump in first-quarter profits - noted that 'like-for-like'
sales in its 114-outlet PACE warehouse chain dipped by almost 6 per cent
during the three months to April.
Waban, which owns the smallest of the five big warehouse club chains,
reported a 28 per cent fall in underlying first-quarter profits.
On the west coast, shares in Washington-based Costco, which has plans to
introduce warehouse clubs to the UK, have halved over the past year. Even
the mighty Wal-Mart Stores has been affected.
Wal-Mart's Sam's Clubs division, the largest club chain, saw revenues from
comparable outlets decline in February and March. That, in turn, fuelled
Wall Street's perennial worries over whether America's top-selling retailer
would be able to sustain its remarkable growth rate. Wal-Mart shares are
flirting with their 52-week low.
Such gloom contrasts sharply with the results established by warehouse clubs
over the past 15 years. The concept was born in California in the
late-1970s, when an aptly-named entrepreneur, Mr Sol Price, opened the first
outlet in San Diego.
Competitors quickly followed Mr Price's lead and club sales erupted. Having
stood at only Dollars 2bn in 1984, they rose to almost Dollars 18bn in 1989.
Last year, they totalled Dollars 33bn. These advances have come partly from
new openings, but some operators - such as Costco - have enjoyed comparable
store sales growth in excess of 20 per cent in recent years.
Today, the typical warehouse club outlet comprises a large shack, probably
on the outskirts of an urban area and stocked with anything from office
supplies to food items, which are sold at bargain-basement prices.
Many of the customers, who usually pay a one-off membership fee, are small
businesses. To keep costs down, warehouse clubs carry a limited range of
items (perhaps 3,500 to 4,500 compared with a discount retailer's
20,000-plus), have shorter opening hours, and use minimal advertising.
Gross margins in the warehouse club business have always been thin, making
sales growth essential to any profit momentum. Now, it seems, this is
waning.
'Warehouse clubs have found it difficult to get any real sales growth,' says
Mr Walter Loeb, retail consultant.
Mr Jeffrey Feiner, analyst at Salomon Brothers, estimates same-store sales
growth at Costco and Sam's will probably reach 5 per cent in 1993, way below
the double-digit figures seen in recent years.
However, this stagnation, say the pessimists, is only symptomatic of more
fundamental problems faced by the warehouse club industry:
Clubs are seeing increased competition from a new breed of specialised
superstores. These have sprung up in many product sectors, from books to
footwear, and, in many cases, have yet to prove themselves in profit terms.
Such outlets are large (at upwards of 100,000 sq ft, they are at least three
times the size of an average UK supermarket) and carry an extensive range of
products within a clearly defined merchandise category.
The Incredible Universe stores, which Tandy Corporation opened in Texas and
Oregon last year is a good example. At about 150,000 sq ft, these outlets
are about 50 per cent larger than the average warehouse club.
They are filled solely with electronic goods, from refrigerators to cameras,
which are proffered at highly attractive prices.
'These power retailers have well-informed sales people to advise on
selection,' comments Mr Loeb. 'They carry competitively-priced products, so
many customers no longer regard warehouse clubs as the lowest price source.'
He notes that some supermarkets are devoting part of their store space to
warehouse-style racking, bulk-packaged goods and selling at club-style
prices.
There is the lack of growth in the economy generally, and in the small
business sector in particular.
According to Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the financial information group, the number
of new business incorporations was on a steady five-year decline between
1986 and 1991, while business failures have been mounting steadily and
reached record levels in 1992.
In an effort to stimulate sales, some warehouse club operators have been
experimenting with new product lines. Costco, for example, has tested garden
equipment and professional tools, while others have added drug store
products and optical services.
The clubs' success is intrinsically linked to their very tight operating
parameters, and the wafer-thin margins leave little room for error. Any
significant increase in items offered, tends to result in a disproportionate
rise in selling costs.
Club operators, buoyed by the apparent success of their sub-sector, have
been opening new outlets at a formidable rate. This has led to congestion in
certain geographical regions.
In the Dallas-Fort Worth area, for example, Sam's had more than a dozen
stores by the end of 1992, PACE had four, and Price Club, one. Almost
two-thirds of these outlets had opened over the past two years.
That said, some analysts think the recent reaction to the clubs' sales
slowdown has been overdone.
They note that food items account for over half the clubs' turnover, and
that food prices have been falling - meaning that sales in this area have
had to run to stand still. That is unlikely to be a long-term trend.
The warehouse club sector may have scope for some further consolidation,
alleviating the congestion difficulties. To an extent, this has happened. An
example is the merger of PACE and Price Savers, once owned by Kroger, the
supermarket group.
'Similar to other retail sub-sectors, we believe that the warehouse club
sector will have to undergo some type of shake-out,' say analysts at
Salomon.
What seems likely is that, if home market growth is slowing, warehouse club
operators will be increasingly anxious to expand their horizons. This has
started to happen.
Wal-Mart and Price Company, have crossed the border into Mexico in
conjunction with local partners.
Price Company, in a joint venture with Littlewoods, and Costco, in which
France's Carrefour owns a minority stake, plan to open outlets in the UK.
Both companies operate a dozen or more club outlets in Canada.
Price, while denying that overseas expansion is simply a response to
sluggish conditions at home, has a joint venture in Spain and Portugal,
where it is looking for sites in the hope of opening its first warehouse on
the outskirts of Madrid next year.
However, Price is more cautious about some pundits' suggestions that the
warehouse clubs could work well in parts of eastern Europe.
'Eastern Europe is a procurement question,' it comments. 'One can establish
clubs, but will one have products to sell?'

FT  21 MAY 93 / International Company News: Japan's trading houses hit by
portfolio losses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S leading trading houses yesterday reported sharply lower profits
after booking losses on securities investments made during the late 1980s.
Mitsubishi Corporation, the core company of the Mitsubishi group, reported a
62 per cent fall in net profits, to Y15.3bn (Dollars 137.83m), for the year
to March, after making provisions of Y66bn for stock losses and the
restructuring of MC Finance, a subsidiary which became a symbol of its
investment excesses during the late 1980s.
The profits of several other trading houses, including Sumitomo Corporation,
Marubeni, and Itochu were also dragged down by losses on their securities
funds, which had been regarded as an important profit centre to supplement
core profits during the late 1980s, when stock prices rose sharply.
Mr Tetsuo Kamimura, Mitsubishi's managing director, said the company covered
some losses by realising Y30bn from the sale of equities. He said the
company still had Y918bn in unrealised gains on stocks, but it included
Mitsubishi group cross-holdings that were unlikely to be sold.
Transactions by Mitsubishi for the year totalled Y14,996bn, down 4.5 per
cent, while pre-tax profit was 12 per cent lower at Y75.6bn and was forecast
to slip to Y75bn this year.
Sumitomo Corporation reported a 12 per cent fall in turnover to Y16,530bn,
and pre-tax profit fell 35 per cent to Y41bn as the company reported a
Y18.7bn appraisal loss on securities holdings and made a Y12.9bn special
profit on a property sale.
Mitsui and Co reported a 4 per cent decline in total turnover to Y15,496bn,
but a 5.9 per cent increase in net profit to Y23.9bn, mainly because its
exposure to securities investment funds was less than that of other trading
houses.
Itochu reported a 7.4 per cent decline in transactions to Y18,529bn but a 10
per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Y49.8bn, attributed to a decrease in
interest payments following a reduction of interest rates over the year.
Marubeni said turnover fell 7.5 per cent to Y16,863bn, while pre-tax profit
was 2.6 per cent lower at Y37.4bn, and net profit slipped 37.4 per cent to
Y10.9bn.

FT  21 MAY 93 / International Company News: Navistar ends run of 10
quarterly deficits

<TEXT>
AN INCREASE in medium and heavy truck sales in the second quarter allowed
Navistar International, the US truck and engine maker, to claw back to a
quarterly profit after 10 consecutive quarters of losses.
Navistar said net income was Dollars 8m, or 1 cent per common share, in the
second quarter of this year against a net loss of Dollars 35m, or 17 cents,
in the same quarter of 1992.
Sales jumped 36 per cent to Dollars 1.24bn.
Navistar increased its share of the North American truck market to 28.7 per
cent from 26.4 per cent last year. Shipments of medium and heavy trucks and
school bus chassis rose 40 per cent to 20,700 units. Diesel engine shipments
rose 19 per cent. Navistar sold 71,500 trucks in the quarter, up 19 per
cent.
The rise in sales prompted Navistar to increase its projections for overall
industry demand for trucks in 1993-94. The company expects North American
demand for heavy trucks to rise 27 per cent, while medium truck and school
bus chassis demand will rise 10 per cent.
'Orders for heavy trucks remain strong, while the market for medium trucks
is improving as well,' said Mr James Cotting, Navistar's chairman.
The profitable quarter comes just as the troubled truck maker is in the
final stages of negotiating a settlement with employee unions to restructure
retiree health care and life insurance programs.
The settlement, which has been accepted by the unions and is awaiting court
approval, involves issuance of 255m shares of new common stock. The issue
will double Navistar's share base.
As the result of 1980's restructurings and the sale of its International
Harvester heavy equipment operations, Navistar supports three retirees for
every active worker. The proposed settlement, while diluting stock, is
projected to save Navistar Dollars 90m per year in costs.
Navistar intends to seek shareholder approval of the settlement at a special
meeting scheduled for late June.

<TEXT>
TELEFONICA, the state-controlled Spanish telecommunications monopoly, has
reported consolidated group pre-tax profits for the first three months of
1993 of Pta19.3bn (Dollars 166.4m), a 17.4 per cent increase on the same
period last year.
According to figures filed with the CNMV, the Spanish stock market
commission, Telefonica's group sales reached Pta306.5bn, up from Pta284.8bn
in the first quarter of 1992.
Earlier this month, the Telefonica parent reported first-quarter pre-tax
profits of Pta18.3bn, up from Pta14.9bn last year, while it said turnover
totalled Pta292bn, up from Pta270bn.
The fact that group profits have overtaken the parent's will come as some
relief to the company. Consolidated profits last year were hit by losses at
some of Telefonica's smaller domestic service companies.

PRE-TAX profits of Merchant Retail Group fell by Pounds 640,000 to Pounds
1.08m in the year to March 27, although turnover increased from Pounds 170m
to Pounds 186m.
The results include property profits of Pounds 664,000 and a provision of
Pounds 574,000 for the closure of Barnum's.
Capital expenditure amounted to Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 9m), but tighter
controls on working capital had resulted in a reduction in bank borrowings
to Pounds 16.7m (Pounds 17.8m).
A final dividend of 0.75p (nil) makes an unchanged total for the year of
1.1p. Although not fully covered by earnings of 0.84p (1.24p), the directors
said the payment was appropriate as action had been taken to deal with the
loss-making businesses and further cost reductions were being introduced.
The shares rose 1 1/2 p to 16 1/2 p.

FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Southern Business shares fall after
provisions warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Southern Business Group fell by 19 per cent yesterday to 67p as
the the photocopier leasing company warned it would make provisions of
Pounds 3m in the second half to pay for a reorganisation of existing
contracts.
The company said it had decided to make fundamental changes to the way in
which its contracts were marketed and administered.
Customers would be sent bills showing the amount of copies actually made,
along with the volume agreed in the contracts. In many cases, because of the
effects of recession on smaller businesses, the actual number used would be
lower. Southern Business Group plans to bring its existing contracts in to
line with the actual number used.
'This policy will enhance the group's reputation for customer service,' said
Mr David McErlain, chairman. 'While it will inevitably lead to an ongoing
cost, the board believes the benefits . . . will significantly outweigh
these costs.'
The decision follows the group's revelation earlier this year that it had
uncovered 'improprieties' in its dealings with some customers. About 12
salesmen and one director subsequently left the company.
Southern issued the warning yesterday as it revealed virtually static
pre-tax profits for the first half of Pounds 7.2m (Pounds 7.1m). Sales were
8 per cent ahead to Pounds 29.4m for the six months ended March 31.
Although Mr McErlain said market conditions remained difficult, the dividend
was raised by 10 per cent to 1.27p. Earnings were ahead from 4.93p to 4.99p.
The group also announced the appointment of Mr Roger Limpenny, previously
finance director, as joint managing director with Mr McErlain. Mr David
Holton, company secretary, was appointed finance director.

FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Denton stirs debate on future of junior
market - Minister calls for an entrepreneurial approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEBATE over the future structure of a junior market was given added
impetus yesterday with a call from Baroness Denton, the minister for small
companies, for a more entrepreneurial market aimed at encouraging growth in
smaller companies.
Speaking to the Financial Times at the opening of the Hoare Govett Small
Companies Exhibition, Baroness Denton called for a 'greater sense of risk
and enterprise' in any new market which might succeed the Unlisted
Securities Market, due to close in 1996.
'Some people want to gamble with their investments and I would rather they
gambled on industry than on horses,' she said.
Referring to the Stock Exchange's role as a regulatory body, which is often
quoted as one the main obstacles to the creation of a higher risk
professional market, the minister said:'I think there is a balance which can
be achieved between risk and security.'
She stressed the importance of smaller companies to the UK economy. Figures
published this week showed that companies with fewer than 20 employees had
helped create 350,000 new jobs between 1989 and 1991. 'Britain's prosperity
depends on the continuing vitality of this sector,' she said.
The minister is due to meet Stock Exchange representatives next month to
discuss alternatives to the USM.
Proposals include the call by the lobby organisation, Cisco, for a
three-tier market, including a higher risk sector aimed at professional
investors. The Stock Exchange has also set up a working party on the issue,
which meets for the first time next week.
The small companies exhibition, the second organised by Hoare Govett,
attracted some 45 companies ranging in market value from Pounds 5m to Pounds
250m.
Hoare Govett estimated that between 300 and 350 brokers, institutional
investors and visitors were due to attend the exhibition in London's
Barbican centre.
Mr Peter Meinertzhagen, chairman of Hoare Govett, said the recent revival in
the UK smaller companies market had begun to attract international
investors. Representatives from the US had attended the London exhibition.
Exhibition participants welcomed the opportunity to meet a wide range of
institutions and brokers.
'We have seen a lot of fund managers we might never have met,' said Mr James
Wallace of Pifco Holdings. 'From that point of view it is definitely worth a
day out.'

FT  21 MAY 93 / British Gas says it may have to cut 15,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS could be forced to cut as many as 15,000 jobs or 20 per cent of
its workforce in its core gas business over the next couple of years because
of increasing competition and regulatory pressure.
But Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, said the company's plans depend on the
outcome of an inquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which is due
to make its report by the end of July.
By the end of this year, British Gas plans to cut around 4,000 jobs in its
UK gas business division - about 1,000 more than previously planned - and
just over 1,200 among its headquarters staff.
The cost-cutting move is being prompted by a squeeze on British Gas's
profits from a price cap on household sales and the growth of competition in
the industrial and commercial market.
Competition and regulatory pressure led to a Pounds 75m reduction in
first-quarter profits on sales in the UK, but this was largely offset by
lower gas purchase costs and growth in British Gas's overseas operations.
Overall, first-quarter profits slipped by Pounds 8m to Pounds 650m after the
exploration and production division showed a Pounds 60m increase in profit
to Pounds 175m.
The UK gas business reported a drop in profit to Pounds 743m from Pounds
789m.
Mr Brown said the MMC report would have an important effect on future
profitability: 'The ability for the company to expand and prosper depends on
getting a fair reward for investment. The alternative is a damaging squeeze
on profits.'
He said that if the household supply market were opened up to competition,
some customers would gain price savings of as much as 15 per cent. But
British Gas estimates that only 6m - a third - of its customers would gain
and 12m households would end up paying more, some as much as 90 per cent
more.
In an effort to encourage competitors into the market for high-volume, low
price sales - the so-called interruptible market - British Gas is discussing
setting up peak sales trading. This would help rivals to balance supply and
demand by providing a marketplace for excess gas where large users could buy
cheap supplies.

FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Warner Estates declines to Pounds 3.76m at
midterm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WARNER Estates reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.76m for the six months
to March 31, compared with Pounds 4.11m restated on a FRS 3 basis to take
account of realised capital surpluses less released revaluation gains.
The main interest of the company is property investment but the pre-tax
figure also included losses of Pounds 268,000 from marble and tiling
activities.
Turnover was Pounds 5.41m (Pounds 6.42m) including Pounds 1.16m (Pounds
505,000) from marble and tiling.
Rental income increased slightly and this was expected to continue as rent
reviews and lettings occurred. Further restructuring has been undertaken at
marble and tiling where indications for the second half were more hopeful.
Earnings per share came out at 5.43p (6.08p) and the interim dividend is
raised to 3.65p (3.5p).

FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Net assets improve at MCIT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEZZANINE Capital and Income Trust (2001) maintained its final dividend at
7.5p yesterday, as it announced an increase of 43 per cent in the net asset
value of its capital shares and 9.6 per cent in the nav of its income shares
in the year to March 31.
The split capital invest- ment trust invests in the debt and in the shares
of US com- panies. The portfolio, which is managed by Jordan-Zalasnick, the
US group, has in- vestments in just eight companies.
During the year, the trust realised an investment in Rockwood, which brought
in Dollars 9m. A restructuring of American Safety Razor, another of the
group's investments, resulted in MCIT receiving Dollars 1.2m of
payment-in-kind notes.
Although these are classed as revenue, they are not cash, and the board
accordingly cut its interim dividend. The total dividend is thus down at
13.75p, against 14.5p.
However, ASR has filed to make a public offering in the US. If this happens,
MCIT will receive cash for the payment-in-kind notes, which it will
distribute as a special interim dividend.
The trust's equity assets were valued at Pounds 55.9m, up from Pounds 43.3m
at the end of the previous financial year, an increase of 29 per cent.
The net asset value per capital share was 255.3p, while nav per income share
was 120.7p.

FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Laing joins growing number of UK
housebuilders to report sharp improvement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Laing yesterday joined the growing number of UK housebuilders to report
a sharp improvement in the housing market since the beginning of this year.
The company said that agreed sales, on which a deposit had been paid, rose
significantly compared with the first four months of last year. Part of this
was because of a temporary rise in sales to Housing Associations taking
advantage of a government spending initiative which ended in March.
If Housing Association business was excluded, private sector sales had still
risen by 20 per cent, said the company, which operates only in south-east
England.
'Downward pressure on prices in the south-east has virtually ceased and the
need to employ sales incentives is reducing,' according to Laing which said
it had seen a considerable improvement in the level of deposits taken in the
first three months of 1993.

FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: French Connection returns to the black with
Pounds 102,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a plunge to losses of Pounds 8m last time, French Connection, the
USM-quoted clothing wholesaler and retailer which is 80 per cent owned by Mr
Stephen Marks, scraped back into the black with Pounds 102,000 pre-tax in
the year to January 31.
Mr George Wardale, chairman, pointed out that second-half profits were
Pounds 637,000, a position with which he said he could be 'cautiously
positive.'
Operating profits emerged at Pounds 2.48m (losses Pounds 3.94m).
The year saw further rationalisation and reorganisation of the group. This
restructuring followed the management changes, and the consequent shifts in
activity, of a year ago.
Exceptional costs of Pounds 1.32m (Pounds 2.93m) included some Pounds
800,000 for the closure or disposal of seven French Connection concessions.
There are now 31 outlets in the UK and eight in the US.
Mr Wardale said that, all things remaining equal, the rationalisation of the
retail business was complete. The Pounds 500,000 balance in the exceptionals
was for the closure of the warehouse in France and professional fees
connected with the group refinancing.
These moves were part of the concentration on the core - made up of the
brands and outlets of French Connection and Nicole Farhi.
Although sales in French Connection Wholesale declined Pounds 2m to Pounds
10.3m operating losses were cut to Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 2.8m).
Nicole Farhi Wholesale lifted sales to Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 5.4m) and, with
improved margins, made profits of Pounds 1.6m (losses Pounds 300,000).
Retail sales grew Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 13.6m and losses shrank to Pounds
200,000 (Pounds 300,000).
Profits of Pounds 900,000 (losses Pounds 100,000) were struck in the US. The
French operation broke even (Pounds 400,000 loss) on lower sales, and in
Hong Kong profits were held at Pounds 300,000 because of adverse currency
movements.
Group turnover decreased to Pounds 47.4m (Pounds 49.9m). Losses per share
were 3p (40.6p).

FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: FT-A Bank Index above All-Share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK BANK shares yesterday ended a 16-year run of underperforming the equity
markets, a turning point that underscored their recovery in investors'
opinion.
The FT-Actuaries Bank Index rose 1.5 per cent yesterday to close at 1,406.97
compared with the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index's which ended at 1,393.64.
Thus, the ratio of the bank index to the All-Share, known as the sector
relative, was greater than 100 per cent for the first time since 1977.
The bank index - based on shares of the large high street clearing banks and
others including Standard Chartered and Abbey National - stayed below the
All-Share in the 1980s because of losses on loans to less developed
countries and high interest rates.
Some analysts have predicted that the sector would continue to outperform
this year as expectations of bank profitability rise.
Investor confidence in bank shares has grown strongly over the past 18
months as banks are perceived to have improved their management, and to have
set in train profit recoveries extending to 1995 or 1996.
The sector relative figure has risen from around 70 per cent at the end of
1991 to 101 per cent yesterday. It was boosted last July by the addition of
HSBC Holdings to the sector following its acquisition of Midland Bank.
Mr Nick Collier, analyst at Morgan Stanley, said the banks' sector relative
figure would have stood at about 88 per cent yesterday without the addition
of HSBC Holdings.
This left scope for further outperformance by banks this year.
Mr Collier said he believed banks would be inherently more profitable in a
low interest and low inflation economy where the risks accompanying loans
were cut.
Banks are still suffering from losses on loans made in the late 1980s.
Mr Robert Law, analyst at Lehman Brothers, said bank shares had
underperformed during the 1980s because of loan problems, and the dilution
of capital through high inflation, which had required a series of rights
issues.
He said current share prices largely discounted recoveries in earnings up to
1995 or 1996, and the outperformance of bank shares could be fragile if
assumptions that future loans would be less risky than past ones proved
wrong.
The last time that the FT-A All Share was at the same level as the banks'
index was January 17, 1977.
Bank shares reached their lowest relative level in April 1989, when they
fell to 66 per cent of the FT-A All Share.

FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Gerrard &amp; National rises 61% - EC directive
requires disclosure of hidden reserves for the first time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERRARD &amp; National, the financial group which owns one of the City of
London's leading discount houses, yesterday made a full disclosure of its
profits and reserves for the first time in its 137-year history.
Following the implementation of the European Community's second banking
directive, Gerrard has ended the practice of making transfers of undisclosed
sums to and from hidden reserves.
On the new accounting basis of making full disclosure, Gerrard made pre-tax
profits of Pounds 25.2m in the year to April 5, a rise of 61 per cent on a
restated Pounds 15.7m.
It also disclosed that it had Pounds 6.1m in hidden inner reserves, which
have now been transferred to published reserves. On this new basis,
published shareholders' funds totalled Pounds 109m at the year end.
Gerrard's business is divided into two parts, a trading division, which acts
as a principal in securities and money markets, and a broking division,
which is an agent in the same markets.
The trading division made pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.3m, a rise of 74 per
cent, while the broking division made Pounds 13.9m, 53 per cent higher.
Mr Brian Williamson, chairman, said the group was a substantial beneficiary
from the trading activity generated by the UK's withdrawal from the Exchange
Rate Mechanism last autumn and the subsequent falls in UK interest rates.
Gerrard &amp; National Limited, the group's discount house which is part of the
trading division, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 8m, up from Pounds 3m.
Discount houses are traders in short-term money market instruments such as
bills of exchange, and have the privilege of being able to trade directly
with the Bank of England.
The dividend for the year is being increased from 21p to 21.5p, an increase
of 2.4 per cent on 1992. Earnings per share were 38p, up from 24.3p.
Mr Williamson said the small dividend increase was justified by Gerrard's
record of always increasing the dividend, even during more difficult trading
conditions, ever since the group took its modern form in 1969 with the
merger of two discount houses, Gerrard &amp; Reid and the National Discount
Company.
He pointed out that the group had diversified its interests substantially
over the past few years. As a result, earnings from non-discount interests
last year contributed 90 per cent of the cost of the group's dividend,
compared with 20 per cent four years ago.
King &amp; Shaxson, another discount house group, also disclosed yesterday that
it more than doubled profits in the year to April 30. Profits before
exceptional items but after providing for rebate and taxation were Pounds
2.21m, up from Pounds 920,000.
The full year dividend proposed by the group is 9p, up from 5p.
The consolidated profit and loss account for the year includes the results
of Smith St Aubyn, a discount house owned by King &amp; Shaxson.

FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Inveresk valued at Pounds 79m in 150p share
offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVERESK, the Scotland-based speciality paper maker, is valued at Pounds
78.8m in a placing and intermediaries offer launched yesterday, with shares
being issued at 150p.
The company, which was bought out by its management from Georgia-Pacific in
1990, is going public in order to expand and, over time, to make
acquisitions.
It operates four mills, three in eastern Scotland and one in Somerset,
making speciality types of paper.
The offer will raise Pounds 32.1m. Of this Pounds 7.8m will be used to pay
off preference shares and outstanding borrowing, leaving about Pounds 2m to
help finance future expansion.
After the issue Inveresk will be without debt and will have unutilised
borrowing facilities of Pounds 20m.
On the basis of historic earnings per share of 11.5p for the year to
November 28 1992, the offer values the company at 13 time earnings. Notional
net dividend per share last year was 5p, producing a yield of 4.2 per cent.
Of the 22.6m shares being issued, some 14.7m are being placed with
institutions and 7.9m are offered to directors, employees and
intermediaries. Directors are retaining 85 per cent of their holdings and,
with employees, will own 26 per cent of the company after the issue.
Existing institutional shareholders will own 23 per cent.
COMMENT
Inveresk is floating without a profits forecast and with an operating
profits line that does not soar upwards. But that is good by the standards
of the paper industry over the last three years. As an MBO company it paid
off its debt rapidly and invested in plant improvements. Having recently
extricated itself from high volume, commodity sectors of the paper market,
it is purely a niche operator with a broad spread of products and customers.
Pulp represents only 30 per cent of total costs. It now has a low cost base
and enjoys operational gearing in spare capacity to take advantage of the
economic upturn in the UK. Management is experienced, though not necessarily
in making acquisitions, which it intends to do. Opinion is divided on
whether Inveresk will itself be taken over, but that is not its intention.
The placing has proved popular with institutions looking for a stock which
will benefit from this stage of the cycle and allocations have been much
smaller than those asked for. The issue is fairly priced at a modest
discount to the market on a historic p/e ratio of 13, which could easily go
to 15 when trading begins.

<TEXT>
SMITHKLINE Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceutical group, is setting up a
wide-ranging strategic alliance with Human Genome Sciences, one of the new
wave of US companies set up to identify the structure and function of human
genes in health and disease.
The goal is to convert genetic discoveries into new drugs and diagnostic
products. By the nature of pharmaceutical research, these are unlikely to
reach the market for several years.
The companies refused to disclose any financial details, but SB will have to
spend tens of millions of pounds on R&amp;D if the collaboration is to lead to
significant new products.
Dr George Poste, SB's pharmaceutical R&amp;D chairman, said the work would lead
to new drugs and vaccines and also to accurate molecular tests for the early
detection of disease, including the identification of people at risk before
any symptoms have appeared.

FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: France and nursing homes boost Kunick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KUNICK, the leisure group, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.06m for the
six months to March 31, a 29 per cent increase on the comparable pro forma
profits of Pounds 1.6m. There was a significantly improved performance in
France and a turnround in the UK nursing homes, writes Peggy Hollinger.
Last year it sold 50 per cent of Goldsborough Holdings, its UK nursing home
business to County NatWest Ventures. The results assume that the business
had been a 50 per cent associate throughout both periods.
Sales were 5 per cent ahead at Pounds 49.3m (Pounds 47m). After preference
dividends losses per share were 0.26p (0.43p).
Mr Christopher Burnett, chairman, said Goldsborough's performance had
encouraged the joint owners to aim for a flotation within the next 12
months.

FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Brewers' heads down for prolonged
in-fighting - The effects of discounting, the latest weapon in the battle
for market share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WAR of attrition is being fought in the UK beer market: a series of
sporadic, intensive, skirmishes between national brewers intent on gaining
or defending market share.
None of the participants so far has gained much ground; all are beginning to
show the cost of their efforts.
Bass, the UK's leading brewer, this week reported that it had advanced its
market share by 0.2 percentage points in six months, while its profit margin
had fallen from 9.7 per cent to 8.3 per cent.
The aggression is likely to continue for some time, as market conditions
have rarely been better for winning share - or for losing it.
Government orders which forced the national brewers to free about 11,000
pubs - about 10 per cent of the total - from exclusive beer supplies have
opened opportunities for competitors to move into outlets from which they
were previously excluded.
The free trade will expand further. The proportion of beer sold through the
brewers' tied pubs is forecast to decline from 44 per cent of the total in
1989 to about 20 per cent by the end of the decade.
At the same time, take-home trade volume - beer sold through supermarkets
and off-licences - is expected to grow from 18 per cent of the total market
to 30 per cent.
Against a background in which total beer consumption is set to fall by about
5 per cent during the 1990s, largely because of demographic changes, the
national brewers have been forced to sharpen their competitive edge.
With the loss of much of the assured, high-margin flow of sales through
their own pubs, they must now battle to capture outlets controlled by new
pub retailing companies and multiple grocers, by individual licensees and
liquor stores.
The initial response to this prospect saw Courage seek to strengthen its
position by acquiring Grand Metropolitan's breweries and beer brands; and
Allied-Lyons merge its brewing operations with Carlsberg in
Carlsberg-Tetley.
Like GrandMet, regional brewers Greenalls, Boddington and Devenish quit the
industry to become retailers.
Since these dispositions, the struggle for market share has been fought with
a variety of weapons: discounts, supply agreements, loan ties, and increased
marketing.
Courage, despite its denials, is widely regarded as the most aggressive
price-cutter. As its outlets in the GrandMet and Inntrepreneur pub estates
are freed over the next four years, it may be left at a disadvantage with
rivals who each retain several thousand pubs.
That prospect, says one analyst, has led to 'erratic and sometimes frantic'
discounting to gain a more secure position.
But, whoever may have started the latest campaign, discounting is, and has
long been, a weapon in the armoury of all the other brewers - Allied, Bass,
Whitbread and Scottish &amp; Newcastle.
In the competition to supply some of the bigger pub companies - where
increased volumes may compensate for lower prices - discounts have risen to
about Pounds 80 a barrel, or about half the list price. The signs are that
discounting, though on a lesser scale, is spreading to other areas of the
free trade.
The key question is how far the brewers will be prepared to go, and for how
long.
Mr Martin Hawkins, analyst at Nikko Securities, says: 'It does not make
commercial sense for the national brewers to have maintained a high level of
capital investment in restructuring brewing and distribution operations if
it is accepted that the overall return will continue to diminish.
'A committed volume-oriented strategy can ultimately only be successful
through bankrupting the competition and running the risk of bankrupting
oneself. It is in no-one's interests to discount so aggressively for a
protracted period that the major players go broke in the process.'
Brewers, facing equal pressures on margins in the expanding take-home
market, are well aware of the dangers.
Some of the pressure has been eased by cost benefits from the closure of
breweries and other rationalisation measures. But there is still substantial
over-capacity in the industry.
It would take the closure of another brewery by each of the nationals to
remove it, says Mr Roy Moss, chairman of Carlsberg-Tetley.
It seems more likely that weaker regional brewers could be forced out of the
industry first.
However, brewers are already finding that discounting alone is not enough to
secure more volume.
It is significant that the price war so far has been confined to standard
lagers and keg ales - and even there the better-known brands have had to
concede less.
All the brewers' leading brands - Whitbread's Boddington and Stella Artois;
Bass's Carling Black Label and Worthington; Allied's Tetley and Castlemaine,
have increased volume without price cuts.
Such brand portfolios, backed by a supporting package that combines value
for money, and quality of service including loans, long-term agreements, and
promotional and business support, hold increasing attraction for retailers.
Provision of such packages does not come cheap: bad free trade debts have
cost Whitbread Pounds 37m. Allied's bad debt charges were Pounds 17m last
year and Bass's provisions nearly doubled to Pounds 19m in its first half.
But the costs do not have quite the unnerving effect on investors as the
prospects of a full-scale price war. That consideration may help to restrain
the present hostilities.

FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Reduced write-downs cut Westbury loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTBURY, the Cheltenham-based housebuilder, saw pre-tax losses contract to
Pounds 2.18m in the year to February 28 against losses of Pounds 15.1m.
The company said it was 'cautiously optimistic', reporting in the first 11
weeks of this financial year a 15 per cent increase in site visitors and a
20 per cent increase in reservations compared with a strong performance at
the same time last year.
The losses followed exceptional charges of Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 15.8m),
including a Pounds 5.6m write-down on the land bank bringing the total in
land bank write-downs to Pounds 32m over three years.
There was also a Pounds 700,000 provision against losses in associated
companies and the projected shortfall in the cost of completing a joint
venture. The company also provided Pounds 1m against outstanding home loans
made as part of incentive packages.
Turnover was Pounds 133m (Pounds 132m).
Losses per share were 0.3p (17.4p) and a final dividend of 3.25p (5.75p)
gives a total for the year of 5p (9p).

FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Pru helped by accruals accounting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRUDENTIAL Corporation, Britain's largest life assurance company, yesterday
reported that under the new proposed 'accruals' basis of accounting for
profits, its 1992 earnings rose 9 per cent to Pounds 807m.
The Pru had earlier reported profits for the same period using the so-called
embedded value method of accounting, which is currently the industry
standard.
That method however has been criticised by securities analysts as flawed
because it does not recognise profits or losses from insurance policies
until they mature. Under accruals accounting, profits are much more closely
related to ongoing activities.
So far, the Pru is the only big UK insurer to have reported results on an
accruals basis.
The Association of British Insurers, after a two-year study, had asked the
industry to begin experimenting with the method. Earnings were somewhat
lower than analysts had anticipated, reflecting somewhat worse than expected
continuous disability business in its M&amp;G reinsurance arm. However, analysts
noted that the effects of a reorganisation in Prudential's UK life assurance
businesses, which has absorbed Pounds 180m in costs, has produced unexpected
cost savings which will be reflected in the 1993 statutory profits.
Profits on new business rose 30 per cent to Pounds 226m, largely on sales of
single premium products and the so-called prudence bond in particular. But
profits on business in force fell sharply from Pounds 52m to Pounds 36m,
partly reflecting reduced investment returns in Australia and Canada.
Meanwhile, it emerged that a leading shareholders group, Pensions Investment
Research Council, has sharply criticised the Pru for failing to follow best
practice in corporate governance. The Pru is one of the UK's largest
shareholders and its chief executive, Mr Mick Newmarch, has been outspoken
on matters of board behaviour.

FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Control agrees with creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CONTROL SECURITIES, the debt
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
laden property, pubs and brewing group, announced agreement in principle
with its major creditors yesterday on restructuring proposals which would
enable its shares to resume trading by the end of July.
The proposals, which will be subject to shareholder and bondholder approval,
are designed to provide the group with what Mr John Kerslake, finance
director, described as 'a one year breathing space,' while it embarks on a
new business plan aimed at reducing gearing and strengthening the balance
sheet by converting debt into equity.
Control's shares have been suspended at 16 1/2 p since October 1991, when
the group's offices were raided by the Serious Fraud Office in connection
with the investigation into the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
The group was not under investigation, but Mr Nazmu Virani, its former
chairman and chief executive, was arrested in March last year in connection
with BCCI. Since July last year the group has been operating under a series
of 30-day standstill agreements with its banks, led by Barclays, while the
restructuring negotiations were conducted.
The centerpiece of the proposals is a new business plan under which the bulk
of the group's assets would be sold in a 'controlled programme of disposals'
with the proceeds being used to repay the group's Pounds 148m bank debt in
full.
The asset sale would include the group's mixed property portfolio which, it
is hoped, would be largely sold by mid-1995, the group's UK and Spanish
hotel operations and the Belhaven brewery in Scotland and 61 Scottish pubs.
In addition the group's Swiss franc bondholders will be offered a mixture of
new 8 1/4 per cent deferred interest bonds and cumulative convertible
redeemable preference shares in exchange for their existing securities.
If the restructuring is approved at an extraordinary meeting on June 14, Mr
Sydney Robin will step down as chairman and chief executive, and be replaced
by Mr Howard Dyer, a consultant to the group since September who has been
responsible with Mr Kerslake for devising the proposals. Under these the
group will be renamed Ascot Holdings and will focus on the leisure industry,
initially on the group's existing English pub estate which will be
streamlined.
The estate currently comprises 588 tenanted pubs across the country. Under
the plan a streamlined initial core of 150 English pubs would be kept.
Presenting the proposals, Mr Kerslake emphasised that there were substantial
risks inherent within the restructuring proposals, but the board believes
they represent the only practicable means for the group to continue to
trade.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Dialling for dollars, yen, pounds . . .: The government's
sale of shares in BT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Lord Cairns, chief executive of SG Warburg, launches the marketing
campaign for the sale of the government's remaining shares in BT on Monday,
he will be looking forward to a relatively trouble-free few months.
There is a marked contrast with the atmosphere surrounding the second sale
of BT shares in 1991, in which Warburg also played the leading role. That
sale was dogged by political uncertainty in the run-up to the general
election; by concern over the imminent price review by Oftel, the industry
regulator; and by a row with investment institutions over how the float was
marketed.
This time, Lord Cairns will have fewer worries as he announces the timetable
for the sale. He is expected to say that, subject to demand, the Treasury
plans to sell all of its 21.9 per cent holding valued at more than Pounds
5bn in mid-July.
Still, though the current sale is progressing smoothly, a number of concerns
remain.
The first of these is the emergence of wider competition to BT's basic
business. Mr Tim Hirst, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, one of the stockbrokers
which declined to take part in the sale when it was not asked to be a global
manager, says the potential impact has been underestimated. He expects that
cable operators will be providing telephony to more than 2m residential and
550,000 business customers by 1997, compared with a total of 150,000 today.
Mr Hirst estimates that this could cost BT Pounds 550m a year in lost line
rental and call volumes. That is only 4 per cent of BT's current revenues,
but since much of BT's network costs are fixed, there may be a painful
impact on profits. In any event, the entry of the cable operators indicates
the extent to which BT core business, UK telephony, is at last becoming a
competitive market.
The second area of potential concern is, as always, the attitude of the
regulator. Uncertainties currently hang over how much BT should charge its
competitors for the use of its lines; and how it should separate out its
accounts for local and long-distance business. Oftel is expected to report
on this shortly.
For Warburg, global co-ordinator to the offer, the third issue is closer to
home. The structure of the sale is proving controversial. For the first time
in any privatisation 11 global managers will compete among each other to
sell the new shares to the top 500 institutions throughout the world.
The government decided against the usual practice of giving brokers
exclusive rights in different parts of the globe. Instead, it decided that
competition among selected managers would drum up demand and increase the
price at which it can sell its BT shares.
But the idea that there is going to be vigorous competition is not as simple
as it seems.
During the pre-marketing phase, which lasts for around two weeks, all the
brokers - apart from Warburg - may only approach institutions in an region
allocated to them as their home base. Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, for
example, may only market the offer to US institutions, while Daiwa will be
restricted to Japan.
Warburg, however, will be able to market shares anywhere in the world. Only
at the end of the pre-marketing phase can all the managers compete for big
investors in any country.
The delay in competition is meant to prevent institutions from being
pestered by over-zealous government advisers. Warburg is so keen to avoid
such an annoyance that it has introduced rules to control the competition
throughout the sale:
Every week each global manager has to report on how it sees the market in BT
shares developing, with a copy for Warburg.
All contacts with institutions, even within an allocated region, must be
reported to Warburg.
During the roadshows in which BT will actively market the government's
shares around the world, Warburg will be the only adviser in the one-to-one
meetings between the company and potential investors.
Mr James Sassoon, a director of SG Warburg, said: 'In any competition one
needs a set of rules to make sure competition is fair and to make it fair
there has to be some control. We have to make sure the control is not
excessive.'
What has emerged is a hybrid structure combining both competition and
control. But some of the global managers are not convinced that Warburg has
got the balance right.
Some have described the global co-ordinator as 'erring in favour of
excessive control', introducing 'heavy policing' and keeping a 'tight rein'
on the sale.
One global manager advised Warburg 'to play it very carefully and to play it
straight because the potential for conflict is so great'.
The particular concern of some global managers is that Warburg will use the
information passed to it by other brokers to win a greater share of
business, particularly in overseas markets.
However, Warburg says this will not happen because it has established a
'Chinese wall' between the directors co-ordinating the sale and the team
competing for business with the global managers.
Mr Sassoon says that the UK Treasury has made sure that Warburg is not in a
position to 'steal the deal'. The bank is also making it clear to investors
that their bids will be treated on an equal basis regardless of which
manager puts in the bid.
Though relations between the issues' managers may prove delicate, they are
likely to meet considerable appetite for the shares. A number of big UK
institutions, for example, said they were underweighted in BT shares and
welcomed the opportunity to buy more.
Since around two-thirds of the new shares are expected to go to private
investors, as in the previous BT share sale, some institutions may be left
bidding for the stock in the after-market, which should help the shares to
go to a premium after the sale.
There is one other comforting factor. In the last sale, some institutions
felt Warburg was being heavy-handed in threatening to penalise investors who
tried to go short of the stock ahead of the sale. In practice, however, they
had no complaints about the relatively relaxed way the policy was
implemented. Though it will also apply this time, fund managers do not
expect the row to recur.

FT  21 MAY 93 / ScottishPower beats forecast for full-year result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISHPOWER launched the electricity results season yesterday with better
than expected profits, but a dividend that fell slightly below forecasts.
The Glasgow-based company, which engages in electricity generation as well
as distribution, made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 297m in the year ending
March 31, an increase of 14 per cent. Analysts had been expecting a figure
around Pounds 290m. The shares gained 5p to 315p.
The result included a Pounds 23m reorganisation provision offset by a Pounds
9.7m credit for a reassessment of energy losses in the system. There was
also a net interest charge of Pounds 9m and a Pounds 10.4m net premium
charge on redemptions of government debt.
The board is recommending a final dividend of 7.43p, bringing the total for
the year to 11.15p, an increase of 10.1 per cent. The board said this was in
line with a policy of providing sustained real dividend growth, but dividend
cover was maintained at 2.5 times.
Mr Murray Stuart, the chairman, described the past year as 'extremely active
and successful'.
The main source of revenue was the company's home market where sales reached
Pounds 1.2bn, up 5.7 per cent. The rise came both from a price increase and
higher volumes due to the poor weather. Exports to England rose 3.1 per cent
to Pounds 73m.
These are expected to show further increases as the capacity of the
cross-border interconnector is raised.
Turnover in the appliance retailing business rose 37 per cent to Pounds 90m,
producing a profit of Pounds 4.5m, up from Pounds 1.8m the year before.
ScottishPower's profits were boosted by further reductions in costs,
particularly manpower. Staff numbers have fallen by more than 1,400 to 8,038
in the two years since privatisation, contributing to a 49 per cent increase
in operating profit per employee to Pounds 41,000 over the period.
Strong cash flow permitted repayment of Pounds 142m of high- interest
government debt which should provide significant savings until the year
2005, though new accounting rules obliged a write-off of the Pounds 10.4m
premium paid. This reduced gearing from 17.7 per cent to 12.2 per cent.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Ex-Eastman Kodak chief of finance joins Citicorp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Christopher Steffen, chief financial officer at Eastman Kodak until he
quit after 11 weeks because of differences with the chairman of the troubled
film products company, is to join Citicorp, the biggest US bank.
An announcement from the bank yesterday said that Mr Steffen would become a
member of its management committee and 'concentrate on internal operations,
productivity programmes, control and audit'. Mr John Reed, Citicorp's
chairman, added that he expected to recommend that Mr Steffen be made a
Citicorp director, and a senior executive vice-president at the bank.
The move seems likely to be interpreted as an attempt by Citicorp to
introduce solid industrial management experience and a fresh approach to
operational controls. 'Chris brings . . . a breadth of international and
modern industrial experience that will contribute significantly to our
continued focus on . . . operational performance,' said Mr Reed.
Mr Steffen, who was formerly chief financial officer of Honeywell, had come
to Kodak with a reputation for taking tough, rapid action to improve a
company's performance.
His departure appeared to result from a clash with the group's chairman, Mr
Kay Whitmore, over how to approach the company's problems. Mr Whitmore said
at the time that Mr Steffen had left 'not because we disagreed on what needs
to change, but because we could not agree on the process for making that
change happen'.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Recovery continues at Storehouse with profit of Pounds 15.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOREHOUSE, the retail group that includes BhS and Mothercare, continued its
recovery yesterday as it announced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 15.2m.
That was slightly down on last year's Pounds 15.8m, but was after
exceptional costs of Pounds 31.4m to cover losses on the sale of the Habitat
and Richards chains last autumn. Before those costs, the profit was Pounds
46.6m - outstripping City forecasts.
Operating profits for the continuing retail businesses rose fourfold to
Pounds 43m. But Storehouse shares fell 2p to 199p in a subdued market.
Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman, said Storehouse had 'made great progress in
the last year on all fronts', and expected sales and profits growth to
continue in the coming year.
Sales in the continuing businesses rose from Pounds 880.8m to Pounds 966.8m,
although total sales fell to Pounds 1.14bn from Pounds 1.18bn because of the
disposals.
Mr Graham Rider, finance director, said year-on-year sales increases were
still running at about 10 per cent, and margins had improved by 1.5
percentage points. But he insisted this was due to improvements in
Storehouse's organisation and merchandising rather than a general pick-up in
consumer spending.
Earnings per share after exceptionals fell to 0.1p from 2.6p, mainly due to
a significantly higher tax charge. But the company held its final dividend
at 2.5p, making a total pay-out of 5p.
The company is close to drawing up a short list for a new chief executive to
replace Mr David Dworkin who left in February to head US stores group Carter
Hawley Hale. However it could not say when an appointment might be made.
Mr Dworkin, who joined Storehouse in 1990, is widely credited with turning
the group around. He reduced the staff by 900, cut out layers of management
and improved organisation, display and merchandising at BhS.
His reforms helped BhS double its operating profits to Pounds 44.1m last
year. Mothercare, where Mr Dworkin's work is being continued by Ms Ann
Iverson, his former colleague at a US stores chain, moved from a Pounds 3.9m
loss to a Pounds 5m profit.
Ms Iverson said this was due to an operational revamp and price cuts which
helped regain market share.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Plan to seize BR pension fund assets abandoned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday abandoned its plan to seize part of British Rail's
pension fund assets after privatisation in the face of opposition from
trustees, employees and Conservative party backbenchers.
Instead, the roughly Pounds 8.5bn in pension fund assets will be used to
create a joint industry scheme for current employees as long as they remain
in the rail industry. A portion of those assets will be set aside in a
separate pool to pay benefits to present and deferred pensioners.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said yesterday: 'There can be no
question of a U-turn as this is a decision being taken for the first time.'
He said the move was not a blueprint for the future of the pension schemes
of other soon-to-be-privatised industries. 'This plan is particular to the
railway industry.'
Trustees of the Rail Pension Scheme had been urging the government to back
down on its 'Option Two', outlined in the white paper on rail privatisation.
The government had proposed seizing a portion of the pension scheme's assets
in exchange for a promise to pay index-linked pensions indefinitely.
'This is largely what the trustees were looking for, but there are still
some safeguards we are seeking,' said one trustee.
In particular, the trustees want assurances that ministerial powers over the
pension scheme may not be used to weaken the benefit structure in the future
nor to shift the cost-sharing in a way that forces members to increase their
proportion of contributions.
Answering questions at a news conference, Mr MacGregor said the new owners
of the privatised BR companies would be represented on the Joint Industry
Scheme board of trustees but would not have the power either to wind up the
scheme or weaken its benefits without the consent of parliament.
It is envisaged that the JIS will have a trustee company consisting of
employees and representatives of BR's new owners. There will then be a
series of local boards who decide matters relating to conditions of
individual schemes.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Nadir masterminded his own escape, businessman claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British businessman who helped Mr Asil Nadir jump his Pounds 3m bail
yesterday rebutted police claims that there had been a 'Mr Big' who had
organised the fugitive businessman's escape to northern Cyprus.
Mr Peter Dimond, a former aircraft dealer, also said Mr Nadir's escape had
been 'ridiculously easy' to organise, in spite of police surveillance.
Speaking from northern Cyprus, for the first time since Mr Nadir fled the
country, Mr Dimond told the Financial Times that he had organised the
'minute by minute' details of the flight which had taken Mr Nadir from
Compton Abbas in Dorset to Beauvais in France - but insisted that Mr Nadir
had masterminded the overall plans.
'Mr Big was Mr Nadir. He organised it himself,' said Mr Dimond, in response
to reports that the Serious Fraud Office was seeking an individual who
masterminded Mr Nadir's escape.
Mr Dimond said new EC regulations, which do not require passport checks at
airfields, had made it easy to arrange the journey, which had involved two
aircraft and six airfields.
'It was so simple it was unreal. Anyone in the street could have done what I
did,' he said.
Mr Dimond said he had no intention of returning to England in the near
future.
If found guilty of aiding Mr Nadir to jump bail he could face charges under
British law - although in practice it would be impossible to extradite him
without the co-operation of the north Cypriot authorities.
A senior British customs official confirmed last night that the aircraft
carrying Mr Nadir had evaded UK customs and immigration checks.
Referring to his escape from Compton Abbas, the official said that in an
airport of that kind 'nobody would do anything about it', adding: 'We are in
the single market.'
Mr Dimond's role in the flight had started through his family friendship
with Mr Nadir, who had known his wife, Mrs Hope Dimond, since the 1970s.
Speaking from the family home in Hampshire yesterday, Mrs Dimond said: 'It
was basically a social connection - we were friendly with his family. We had
no business connection with Mr Nadir or Polly Peck at all.'
According to Mr Dimond, he had decided to help with the escape because of
frustration at the British authorities' treatment of Mr Nadir.
'We have watched very closely the way the situation has been handled,' he
said. 'There was a time when it was time to go and so his friends said 'OK,
let's do it.' It was just an act of friendship - like giving a friend a lift
in a car.'
A regular user of Compton Abbas airfield, Mr Dimond approached the airfield
owner, Mr Clive Hughes, a week before Mr Nadir's departure to book an
aircraft for himself and a friend.
Then, on the morning of May 4, Mr Dimond and his friend arrived at the
airfield. Mr Hughes said yesterday he had not recognised Mr Nadir, who had
been dressed in dark glasses and a hat, and introduced to him as an
'aviation friend' of Mr Dimond.
'I did it as a private flight for a friend,' said Mr Hughes yesterday, who
claimed that because the aircraft's intercom had been broken during the
hour-long flight he had not spoken to Mr Nadir who had sat, facing
backwards, in the rear of the aircraft. The only payment Mr Hughes had
received had been Pounds 300 to cover the cost of fuel, he said.
Mr Clive Vleiland-Boddy, owner of the piper aircraft, registration number
G-BSPG, yesterday said that he had not known who had been using it.
Under new EC regulations, Mr Hughes said, he had not been required to carry
out any customs check, apart from handing out a leaflet explaining the
passport regulations for passengers leaving England.
When the aircraft arrived in Beauvais, Mr Dimond and Mr Nadir had joined a
second aircraft, a Cessna Citation executive jet, registration N-11HJ, which
had flown from Hatfield to meet them.
'I left them at the aircraft side. Peter knew I had to get back in a hurry,'
said Mr Hughes, who said he was back in England three hours after he left.
Mr Michael Hamlin, owner of Hamlin Jets, which manages the Hatfield airfield
where the Citation jet was based, yesterday confirmed that the Citation had
travelled from Hatfield to Beauvais and then on to Cyprus.
He denied he had had any knowledge of the purpose of the journey.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Democratic rebellion poses threat to Clinton energy tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEMOCRATIC senators launched a rebellion yesterday which threatened to kill
or water down President Bill Clinton's proposed energy tax, a cornerstone of
his economic proposals aimed at raising about Dollars 70bn (Pounds 45bn)
over five years.
The revolt came only a day after Mr Clinton headed off dissent over his
economic plan in the House of Representatives.
Senators David Boren and Ben nett Johnston teamed up with moderate
Republican allies led by Senator John Danforth to launch a rival economic
plan. This would raise taxes by Dollars 150bn over five years, rather than
the Dollars 272bn Mr Clinton proposed, and instead cut Dollars 163bn of
spending on health and pension benefits for the elderly.
Although the senators presented their plan as a fiscally prudent alternative
to the Clinton proposals, their main target is the elimination of the energy
tax, levied on fuels according to their energy content, which is opposed by
oil and gas producers in their home states. Their opposition to the
president's economic bill creates a severe obstacle to its passage. An
Oklahoman, Mr Boren sits on the Senate finance committee, and his defection
would make it extremely difficult to move the economic bill forward.
Mr Johnston yesterday declared the energy tax dead. 'It will not succeed
because it will not get the votes,' he said.
However, Mr George Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, said he was
'convinced that the President's budget plan will pass the Congress largely
intact', but explicitly left the door open for further exemptions from the
energy tax.
Mr Mitchell and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, chairman of the finance
committee, expressed confidence that Mr Boren's plan would not pass the
committee, still less the full Senate, while Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury
Secretary, said long term interest rates would rise if the Clinton budget
were to fail.
Mr Clinton argued yesterday that alternatives to the energy tax such as a
petrol tax fell unevenly on different US regions, while benefit cuts for the
elderly would shift the burden of reducing the budget deficit
disproportionately on those who could least afford it.
Mr Clinton has been able to head off dissent in the House by standing firm
and appealing for party loyalty. Many Democrats in the Senate, however, are
immune to such appeals.
The Democratic majority in the Senate is also much slimmer than in the House
of Representatives - 57-43 in the full chamber and just 11-9 on many
committees.
Less clear, however, is how many Republicans will be willing, for the sake
of inflicting a defeat on Mr Clinton, to add their names to the
Boren-Danforth proposal. This not only enters the politically explosive
territory of pension cuts, but also accepts the increase in top income tax
rates proposed in the Clinton plan - traditionally taboo for Republicans.
Mr Clinton finds himself caught in a tug of war between the left and right
wings of his party.

FT  21 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: ScottishPower
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is clearly something to be said for being first in the privatisation
queue: nervous ministers and merchant bankers tend to err on the side of
caution when making business assumptions and pricing offers. It is thus
ScottishPower's misfortune to have been the government's third attempt to
price correctly the UK electricity industry. The Treasury has managed to
truss the business so that it has neither the slack RPI caps of the regional
electricity companies, nor the generous dividend cover of the generators.
Small wonder, then, that the shares have underperformed the FT-A electricity
sector since privatisation.
Yesterday's figures give some support to those who argue that ScottishPower
can start to make back some ground. Underlying profits growth was 18 per
cent, and the expansion of the interconnector between Scotland and England
will provide a growing stream of unregulated earnings. The company's
management is also making strides to throw off the cosy pre-privatisation
culture. Yet there are worries - most notably the failure to achieve the
rate of return on the electricity transmission business projected at the
time of flotation. Turnover growth is also likely to be sluggish unless some
fierce Scottish winters spark demand. Despite the interconnector, there is
little reason to suppose that the shares can yet move to a below-market
yield.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pity about FRS3. The adoption of the new accounting conventions rather
wrecked Storehouse's annual results, knocking down pre-tax profits to Pounds
15.2m and almost wiping out earnings per share. The damage caused by
disposing of businesses also meant the company had to dip into reserves to
fund its maintained dividend. But the market chose to ignore such
technicalities, concentrating instead on Storehouse's underlying trading. At
that level, the company buffed up its reputation as one of retailing's most
promising recovery stocks, lifting trading profits more than four-fold to
Pounds 43m. BhS doubled its contribution. Mothercare, at last, came back
into the black.
Storehouse's share rating certainly demands as much. Fortunately, the
recovery momentum seems to have a long way to run - although the appointment
of a chief executive would help convert the doubters. BhS's sales per square
foot remain pitiful in comparison with Marks and Spencer. Mothercare's
profit margin is still less than 2 per cent. Yet Storehouse is also laying
firm foundations for solid organic growth over the longer term. Although
expensive in the short run, the repurchase of property freeholds will lower
its future cost base. Its continuing restructuring of store operations will
do the same. Storehouse's recovery is a classic example of the benefits of
concentrating on core businesses - and the joys of starting from a low base.
Would that Burton and Sears were to follow suit.

there is a tendency to forget British Gas's current financial condition. The
result of the investigation will be vital to the company's future, but on
any likely outcome life will continue to be pretty tough. With the RPI-5
price formula and increased competition, earnings this year are likely to be
around 22p a share. That means dividend cover will only be 1.5 times against
the company's declared target of a twice covered payout. Interest cover is
close to the company's own comfort level of four times. Meanwhile capital
expenditure - particularly on exploration and production - will mean a
further cash outflow this year.
Those financial ratios might seem comfortable for a pure utility, but the
profile of the business is shifting markedly. Even if some of the more
radical suggestions are ignored by the MMC, competition in the UK gas
business will increase, lessening the security of the utility franchise. At
the same time, the heavy investment in exploration and production is taking
the company into higher risk areas which will not start to produce
substantial returns until 1995. If the MMC produces a particularly tough
report, that might even force a hard look at the dividend. On a milder
outcome, the prospects for dividend growth will still be severely limited.
The 6 per cent yield on British Gas shares is supposed to reflect
uncertainty over the MMC investigation. But unless that review increases the
rate of return on the UK gas business, a re-rating looks unlikely.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Once again, the economic indicators seem to be pointing in every direction.
After disappointing figures for manufacturing output and retail sales
earlier in the week, yesterday brought the unexpected news that unemployment
fell in April for the third month in a row. Viewed in a slightly longer
perspective, though, the figures are not so confusing. Manufacturing output
rose 2 per cent in the three months to March; retail sales were up 1.4 per
cent in the quarter to April. That is consistent with a moderate recovery in
which the latest figures simply offset earlier months of exceptionally good
figures. Similarly, the recent good news on unemployment compensates for the
particularly bleak period last autumn when the rate of increase seemed to be
accelerating.
Only time will tell if there are also structural changes at work, or how far
the lower jobless rate also reflects pressure on claimants to leave the
register. This time, though, there is a hint of underlying improvement in
the small increase in the manufacturing workforce.
The unequivocally encouraging point is the further fall in average earnings
and the resulting drop in unit labour costs, which are 3 per cent below
March last year. That points to a recovery based on improved competitiveness
with, as yet, no threat to inflation. It is small wonder that sterling took
the figures well. The only trouble is that an exchange rate over DM2.50 does
not provide much incentive for overseas investors to buy gilts. As the
running in the auctions gets tougher, the government might come to regret
that it did not clamp down more in the Budget. It now appears the economy
was strong enough to take such treatment.

FT  21 MAY 93 / No need to hit the panic button: The growing fear in the US
of higher inflation and faltering growth looks exaggerated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The irrationality of financial markets is sometimes remarkable. A few weeks
ago, the fear on Wall Street was that the US economic recovery had ground to
a halt. In the past few days that concern has been replaced by fear of
galloping inflation.
The price of gold - still regarded by many small investors as the ultimate
hedge against inflation - has surged and is now 15 per cent higher than in
early March. And the yield on long-dated bonds climbed briefly above 7 per
cent, on worries that the Federal Reserve might begin to tighten monetary
policy.
When the Fed concluded its policy meeting this week without signalling an
immediate rise in interest rates, there was a collective sigh of relief. On
Wednesday, the Dow Jones Average rose more than 50 points to a new record.
Bond yields and the gold price retreated from earlier highs. But confidence
is fragile: the next bad economic number is liable to set off another wave
of concern.
Faltering growth and faster inflation are ever-present risks. But both at
the same time? If the economy is really slowing, inflation is unlikely to
pose a threat - and vice versa. History suggests that 'stagflation' is a
product of 'supply shocks' - such as the sudden increases in oil prices that
hit the world economy in the 1970s. Nothing of that kind is happening today.
The most legitimate source of concern lies in Washington politics. With
conservative Democrats, Republicans and Texas billionaire Ross Perot all
taking pot shots at the Clinton economic plan, the fate of the
deficit-cutting package is uncertain. If the end result is a substitution of
bigger spending cuts for some of the tax increases, markets will be well
pleased; but the risk is that the various factions in Congress will be
unable to agree on anything.
Meanwhile, if you allow for the 'noise' that seems to envelop nearly every
US statistical series, the stagflation fear looks greatly overstated.
Inflation probably has passed its low point for this business cycle, but it
seems unlikely to gather momentum rapidly. At the same time, the vigour of
the US corporate sector suggests the outlook for growth is better than
widely appreciated.
Mr Paul Mastroddi, senior economist at J P Morgan, the New York bank, notes
that business investment in new equipment has accounted for about a third of
total economic growth in the past year even though this sector represents
only 8 per cent of gross domestic product. Equipment investment was up 14
per cent in real terms in the first quarter of this year against the same
period of last year.
This startling rate of growth helps explain why business leaders showed no
interest in the temporary investment tax credit proposed in President Bill
Clinton's economic plan but since axed by Congress.
The investment surge is being led by huge purchases of computers and other
information processing equipment. Investment in these items (which now
accounts for 45 per cent of all equipment investment) was up more than 21
per cent in real terms in the year to the first quarter. But other
categories of business capital formation are also doing well: investment in
transport equipment and general industrial equipment was up 11.5 per cent
and 7.5 per cent respectively.
Capital formation is admittedly recovering from a relatively low base. But
the investment recovery looks secure because it is underpinned by higher
profits and productivity following extensive corporate restructuring.
After-tax profits rose 10 per cent last year and may rise by nearly 20 per
cent this year.
Productivity was up 3.3 per cent last year, the sharpest increase for a
decade. Gains in service-sector efficiency slowed in the first quarter but
manufacturing productivity was up 5 per cent compared with the same period
last year, the strongest rise since 1977. Mr Bruce Steinberg, senior
economist at Merrill Lynch in New York, reckons the underlying rate of
productivity growth in all sectors of the economy is 2 per cent a year, or
about twice the average rate in the past two decades.
The investment-driven recovery reflects a special feature of this upturn: it
is the first in recent decades to occur spontaneously - that is, without a
big artificial boost from fiscal or monetary policy.
Fiscal policy could not be loosened because of the huge federal deficits
carried over from the 1980s. The Federal Reserve has eased monetary policy,
but not as quickly or as sharply as in some previous business cycles. Real
short-term interest rates are roughly zero, rather than negative; long-term
real rates are 3.5 to 4.0 per cent, high by historical standards.
The federal government's inability to lend a hand together with 'structural'
impediments - such as defence cuts and weak balance sheets in the personal
and corporate sectors - explain the halting recovery. The ballooning of the
trade deficit in March may result in first quarter growth being revised down
to an annual rate of as little as 1 per cent. This sounds awful, but it
follows growth at an annual rate of nearly 5 per cent in the fourth quarter
and is merely the latest of a succession of 'growth dips' since the economy
stopped contracting two years ago.
More recent data is mixed but on balance quite encouraging. Housing starts
and retail sales rebounded in April after bad weather hit businesses in the
first quarter. Car sales early this month were well above first quarter
levels. Industrial production and payroll employment, however, are growing
only slowly. But provided consumer confidence does not sink further, the
economy seems capable of an annual growth rate of 2.5 per cent this quarter,
rising to perhaps 3 per cent in the second half of the year.
Americans are frustrated by the slow recovery. But it may be no bad thing.
The lack of an artificial public-sector stimulus means that companies,
rather than consumers, are taking the lead; ultimately this could result in
a more durable upturn. But will inflationary pressures force the Fed to
tighten monetary policy and ruin everything?
Superficially, there are grounds for concern. Sharp increases in consumer
and producer prices in April were the third set of bad figures in four
months. Since the beginning of the year, the consumer price index has risen
at an annual rate of 3.9 per cent against a 2.9 per cent increase last year.
This cannot all be put down to distortions such as a surge in the price of
fresh vegetables following bad winter storms. The 'core' consumer price
index - which excludes the volatile food and energy components - has risen
at an annual rate of 4.5 per cent since January.
Some of the Clinton administration's policies are also having an adverse
effect. A ruling to block steel imports has allowed US steel companies to
raise prices sharply. The yen's sharp appreciation is forcing Japanese
companies to raise US prices. Instead of concentrating on regaining market
share, US competitors seem to be following suit.
Yet it hard to get too alarmed. Industrial capacity utilisation rates are
well below the levels that sparked inflation in the past. Wage pressures are
subdued, reflecting the 7 per cent jobless rate. Unit labour costs were up
only 1.4 per cent in the year to the first quarter, reflecting the
improvement in productivity.
Price increases, moreover, have been bunched in the first four months in
each of the past three years, casting doubts on the quality of seasonal
adjustments. Some of the biggest sources of price pressures in recent
months, such as higher air fares and tobacco prices - are already being
reversed.
Bond markets are upset because they had anticipated a decline in inflation
from 3 per cent to 2.5 per cent. This no longer looks feasible. But few of
the leading forecasters expect inflation to rise much above 3.5 per cent
this year and some say 3 per cent is still achievable.
In his Delphic public utterances, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has
shown every sign of leaning towards this relatively relaxed view of
inflation trends. Under his leadership, the Fed has sensibly responded to
'facts not forecasts'.
At some point in the next six months to a year, the Fed probably will have
to prove its anti-inflation credentials by raising short-term rates. But
when that crucial turning point arrives, Mr Greenspan will want to confront
a sceptical Clinton administration with incontrovertible evidence of the
need for action. With unemployment high and the vigour of the recovery still
a matter of debate, he does not yet have that compelling evidence.

Things have looked pretty bleak for Franz Steinkuhler, Germany's
cigar-smoking top trade unionist, in the past few days, after all the
publicity about his dealings in Daimler-Benz shares.
So nice to note that, just in time for his 56th birthday yesterday, he has
been getting a few loyal messages among the flood of predictable calls for
his resignation.
The engineering union loyalists quoted an old proverb from the Ruhr, to the
effect that: 'It's the chap who does the work who makes the mistakes. An
idle bloke never blunders.'
While the Mercedes works councils say Steinkuhler is an embarrassment (he
sits on Daimler's supervisory board), the boys at Volkswagen (where he's
also on the supervisory board) say magnanimously they think a bit of
solidarity is in order even if their leaders are prone to err.
Wonder who'll be sending greetings for his 57th.

If you are interested in how honest business types can slip off the rails,
don't forget to watch It's a Steal on BBC2 tomorrow night. In the last of
the current Hypotheticals series, Professor Arthur Miller of Harvard Law
School does a first rate job cross-examining a group of leading British
businessmen employed by an imaginary company. Out of a cast list which
includes Sir John Quinton, Lord Spens and Sir Nicholas Goodison, it is less
well-known types such as Kingfisher's Nigel Whittaker, Michael East of
Eastcastle Management, personal assistant Fiona Alfred, and Roger Pincham of
Gerrard Vivian Gray, who turn in the best performances.
However, the real star of the show is G Ware Travelstead, the US property
developer. Watch him and it's easy to see why he is about the only person to
have made money out of Canary Wharf.

To shame ostentatious descendants into conforming, the ministry has

already been corrected by the removal of stone statuary and the like. The
posthumous offenders included former law-makers, several leading

Modest to the very last, Sir Owen Green stepped down as chairman of BTR,
Britain's ninth-biggest company, after yesterday's annual meeting. Eschewing
the opportunity granted by one shareholder who asked for a resume of his
guiding principles, Sir Owen summed up 37 years of corporate wheeling and
dealing simply; 'All I offered was integrity and competence and all I would
seek from my successors is integrity and competence.'
He departed with none of the razzmatazz that marks Hanson's meetings. There
was no carefully orchestrated speech by a big city figure, nor any offer of
an honorary life presidency. Just a few words from his old colleague Norman
Ireland and Sir Owen was off.

Forget the impending take-over by China. Today's hot topic in Hong Kong is
who should be the number one citizen under the present regime . . . and
governor Chris Patten isn't even a contender. The row centres on the licence
plate '1', now gracing the car of police commissioner Li Kwan-ha. Some
members of the legislative council want it auctioned for charity.
The proceeds, they claim, would be sure to exceed the record Pounds
100,000-plus reputedly paid by businessman Wong Ming-hung for the '2' plate
charitably surrendered for sale by finance secretary Hamish Macleod. So the
police chief ought to follow suit.
But 55-year-old Li disagrees, claiming his licence plate is essential to his
force's esprit de corps. 'When the balloon goes up, our many fine young men
and women are working in the street. If No 1 comes up, it has a tremendous
morale-boosting effect,' he explained.
'In that case,' rejoined one of the auction lobby, 'he ought to drive around
town 24 hours a day.'

FT  21 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Danish stimulus
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE violence in Copenhagen perpetrated by a minority of demonstrators has
sounded a discordant note amid the general relief prompted by Tuesday's
Maastricht referendum result. However, the Yes vote has given the Social
Democrat-led coalition an opportunity to bring in a modest stimulus
programme for the hard-pressed Danish economy.
Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, prime minister since January, is the current
president of the EC council. His personal success in securing a Yes, though
based on treaty opt-outs negotiated by the previous government, makes Mr
Rasmussen one of the few EC leaders entitled to walk with a spring in his
step. He intends to capitalise on this victory by using next month's EC's
summit in Copenhagen as a platform to launch Community-wide measures to
combat the European recession.
Accounting for just 2 per cent of EC GDP, Denmark has limited room to act
alone. Furthermore, the tax cuts and accelerated public sector investment
announced on Wednesday may not be large enough to boost GDP expansion from 1
per cent this year to 3 per cent in 1994, as the government hopes. But by
seizing the opportunity to push for non-inflationary growth, Mr Rasmussen is
setting a good example.
With unemployment now 12 per cent after six years in the doldrums, there is
no doubt that Denmark needs higher growth. There is also no doubt that the
economy is capable of delivering it. Denmark has curbed its spending habits
of the early 1980s. It boasts an inflation rate of 1 per cent and a current
account surplus. Ironically for a country which wants to steer clear of the
plan for a single currency, Denmark is one of the few EC states close to
fulfilling the Maastricht targets set down to guide the path to economic and
monetary union.
Foreign exchange market doubts about Denmark's ability to stay in the ERM
'hard core' have forced the Danish National Bank to maintain high interest
rates during the past 12 months. Uncertainties will remain unless Denmark
provides evidence it can shake off the damage to competitiveness caused by
the European devaluations since last autumn. In view of its Emu opt-out,
Denmark has to work doubly hard to convince the markets that it is serious
about monetary stability.
However, the gap between short-term German and Danish interest rates, in
April as much as 5 percentage points, has now fallen to less than 1 point.
Following this week's 1 point cut in the discount rate, there is now room
for the National Bank to reduce rates further.
By holding down wage rises and putting up with high unemployment, the Danes
have made big sacrifices. Assuming the recession in the larger EC economies
 -above all Germany - does not worsen, Mr Rasmussen now has a chance to show
that rigorous economic management can bring its own reward.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TO PARAPHRASE one of its ministers, Mr John Major's cabinet should come
clean about just how deep a hole it is in. The government is heading for the
largest primary budget deficit in peacetime. Its commendable target is to
cut the borrowing requirement, expected to reach Pounds 50bn this year, from
8 per cent of gross domestic product to 3.75 per cent in 1997-98.
If the rate of economic recovery is rapid, some of this may be achieved
without pain. Revenue from taxation would then rise sharply while the demand
for social security payments fell. Some of the shortfall in revenue could be
met by further increases in taxation, but this the government is
understandably anxious to avoid. The remaining option is deep cuts in
spending.
A strong government would set out its stall thus, and invite the public to
accept the consequences. The administration moves from flap to exasperation,
as it did yesterday over suggestions that the Treasury was pressing for the
withdrawal of the National Health Service from dental care and the scrapping
of free prescriptions for all but the poorest.
To his credit, Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has
been graphic in his delineation of the problem, but necessarily cagey about
possible solutions. The trouble arose when talk of NHS cuts stole headlines
from a prime minister who had spent a day working on restoring his authority
after Maastricht.
On Wednesday Mr Portillo said that something would have to give. At question
time yesterday Mr Major read out a long prepared answer which suggested
that, while everything remained open, the idea of making worse-off
pensioners and parents of sick children pay for their prescriptions could
not have been further from his thoughts. Fine, but he should have explained
that the deficit could not be tackled without some inroads being made into
previously sacrosanct areas, although he could not yet say which ones.
That would be a reasonable if tough line to take. Mr Portillo has been given
until next March or April to find and negotiate long-term reductions in
public spending. There will be plenty of interdepartmental infighting
between now and then. An interim result can be expected in the autumn, when
the expenditure limits for 1994-95 are announced. Genuine reductions should
at that time be demanded of most departments. Will the government be able to
make them stick?
In the present climate there can be little confidence that it will. A
government reversal of policy is no longer a surprise. The Conservatives are
divided; their majority is small; the house is fractious. The cabinet cannot
always have its way; any rebellious dozen of its supposed supporters can
prevent it from doing almost anything. The budget deficit is too serious a
matter to be left to these parliamentary high-jinks. Mr Major must spell
this out, and thereby reassert his leadership.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Personal View: IMF leads where others must follow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD D ERB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Much ado about lending', by Edward Balls and John Lloyd (May 12, 1993), had
too much ado about gossip among unnamed officials, and more than a little
misinformation about help provided in the past and now made available to
Russia and other transition economies by the International Monetary Fund.
Readers may be misled into believing that money is about to be dispensed
without regard for the pace and quality of economic reforms. Such
misperceptions could harm the reform process and western support.
A closer look at what transpired last year would have helped Mr Balls and Mr
Lloyd to appreciate why the IMF recently initiated a fresh approach. They
might have avoided repeating the myth that only Dollars 1bn of an original
Dollars 24bn aid package (for Russia) was disbursed in 1992. In fact, the
IMF alone disbursed Dollars 1bn. Bilateral credits and European Community
disbursements totalled another Dollars 16bn, and formal debt rescheduling
plus the accumulation of arrears conferred effective debt relief of Dollars
14bn. Views may differ on how to count all this against the ill-defined
Dollars 24bn promised by western governments but everyone should understand
that Russia, by standard measures of external financing applied by the IMF
to all countries, effectively received financing of about Dollars 30bn.
Russia could have obtained more help by now from the IMF and elsewhere, and
be closer to a stable market economy, if it had been able to adhere to the
economic and financial programme the government drew up last summer.
Unfortunately, support within Russia for halting inflation and accelerating
basic reforms was not broad enough, and crucial supporting institutional
arrangements were not in place. Credit expansion by the central bank and the
government's budget went badly off track, while most legal and institutional
reform failed to accelerate.
The problem was not that 'the IMF tried to nail down too many details', but
that the government and central bank did not implement their own programme.
From long hard experience in many countries the IMF has learned that the
devil is usually in the details. Successful implementation of a
stabilisation programme requires that the authorities themselves pay full
attention to the details. Some states of the former Soviet Union and other
transition economies have also encountered unanticipated difficulty in
sustaining economic reform programmes, although by contrast the three Baltic
states have had considerable success so far, and not by ignoring the
'details'.
What could be done? Long before any Group of Seven pronouncements, the IMF
was evaluating ways to help transition economies to focus on the preliminary
steps necessary in vital areas before they could execute comprehensive,
fully articulated economic programmes. Concern was also mounting over the
deteriorating external payments situation facing many of them, due to the
collapse of state-directed trade and payments systems and to abrupt hikes in
oil and gas import costs as energy prices were raised towards world market
levels. An innovative form of IMF engagement was needed, and quickly.
The solution devised was a special temporary lending window, similar to
others set up by the IMF in the past, with a more concentrated, streamlined
version of the conditionality associated with traditional IMF standby
credits. That is where Mr Balls and Mr Lloyd are especially wide of the
mark: far from jettisoning 'financial considerations', the chief element for
countries to qualify for the new IMF loans will be adoption of the critical
measures needed to move towards financial stability. Mr Lawrence Summers is
right: conditionality is being focused, not weakened.
In all its lending operations the IMF seeks credible assurances - including
initial actions - that sound financial policies will indeed be taken by
borrowing countries. Only then does the IMF begin to disburse. Further
drawings are conditional on agreed indicators of financial stabilisation
being met.
The IMF's new 'Systemic Transformation Facility' (STF), to provide modest
opening round help to hard-pressed transition economies, was unveiled to
strong support from its executive board. The ensuing Tokyo endorsement by
the G7 of the IMF proposal was gratifying, but equally vital will be
additional G7 financial support. A large G7 bilateral aid package for Russia
is welcome, but support for the other transition economies, many highly
interdependent with Russia, has still to be announced. Here again the IMF is
taking the lead - the first STF drawing has just been approved for
Kyrgyzstan. The G7 and others must soon follow.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Good news on UK earnings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CELEBRATIONS ARE indeed in order. But this is not mainly because seasonally
adjusted unemployment has declined for the third successive month, if by a
mere 1,400. Far more encouraging is the further fall in pay inflation. The
UK now has a chance to secure the stable, low-inflation economy for which so
many have suffered so much.
Over the three months to April 8 seasonally adjusted unemployment fell by
52,700. This is unprecedented at so early a stage of an upturn. One
explanation for the good news is the strength of the recovery, as shown in
data on retail sales and manufacturing output published earlier this week.
The 'hire and fire' mentality is another explanation, the implication being
that the falling unemployment must be set against the huge increases at the
end of last year. The inflow into the labour force is also smaller than in
the early 1980s.
Against such optimistic views of the prospects must be set the lack of any
significant increase in the stock of vacancies, following its jump between
January and February. The unexpected declines in unemployment may simply
reflect an overhang of Jobcentre placement targets last financial year. If
so, they will not continue. The picture should be clearer when information
on employment in the first quarter of 1993 becomes available in the next
Labour Force Survey, due in June.
Less murky, and more encouraging, is the decline in the underlying annual
increase in whole economy earnings, to 4 per cent. Seasonally adjusted
earnings rose 2 per cent in manufacturing in March, but fell 0.6 per cent in
services. This divergence, already apparent earlier this year, may reflect
sterling's departure from the ERM. Nevertheless, wages and salaries per unit
of manufactured output fell by 2.9 per cent over the year to March, because
of a 7.8 per cent rise in output per head.
Taken with the Bank of England's latest forecast for underlying inflation
over the next 18 months, these trends imply negligible growth in real
earnings. One implication is that growth in real expenditure per worker
would make little contribution to the recovery in demand. A more favourable
one is that real earnings would grow more slowly than labour productivity.
That is precisely how to combine devaluation with stable inflation. It is
also how to increase incentives for employment. Low growth in real wages has
to be a better way to sustain competitiveness than fast productivity growth
in an economy with some 3m unemployed.
If the underlying increase in earnings were kept to 4 per cent, or less, it
would be possible to combine low inflation with modest increases in real
earnings per worker. This mixture can give the UK the steady rise in output
and employment that it needs. It could even justify the stringent
disinflationary policies of the past several years. Mr Major may U-turn
elsewhere. On this he must not.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Raise a glass to Mr Clarke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke is a jolly chap, full of warm beer and words like
'judgment', 'common sense' and 'reasonable decisions' - the home secretary
who personifies England. It is he who, following a waffly intervention by Mr
Robert MacLennan, Liberal Democrat, replied: 'In response to the honourable
gentleman, I ask him to go away, lie down in a dark room, keep taking the
tablets and think carefully about whether the Liberal Democrats have an
opinion one way or the other on the merits of any of the proposals that I
have just announced.'
That is the authentic voice of the cheerful thug at his most cheerful and
his most thuggish. It earns him this season's second prize for the most
successful speech announcing a government retreat from a previous position;
the first is still firmly in the grasp of Mr Douglas Hurd, although whether
he earned it defending Maastricht or failing to defend Bosnia is a fine
point. The foreign secretary can make the most guilt-ridden slide down the
back drainpipes of policy seem like an elegant drawing room pirouette. The
home secretary simply puts his foot on the bar rail, his elbow on the
counter, looks up at the house and asks: 'What're you having squire?'
What the Commons is having is bar-room wisdom from a politician who was
highly rated for having roughed up the nurses when he was health secretary
and the teachers when he was at education, which is to say overrated. Our Mr
Clarke's performance is perpetually diminished by hindsight. Do not mistake
the import of this seemingly harsh judgment. Everything has a context. When
you consider the home secretary's colleagues - men such as, say, the
chancellor, or the first lord of the Treasury - our hero stands out as
certainly their equal and, some venture, their better.
True, he did not leave either of his two previous departments in a condition
of smoothly oiled perfection. That accounts for his less than triple-A
overall rating. But his quick wit, his bonhomie and his willingness to
tackle powerful interest groups should take him far in this administration,
in spite of what can now be seen as questionable results at health and
education.
None of this has much to do with the principal task of the Home Office,
which is to protect us from criminals. We should not blame Mr Clarke for
that. His preoccupation, like that of his fellow-ministers, is with the
office politics of his chosen profession. Who will be promoted, where to,
and when? These are the motivating questions. A healthy concern about such
matters keeps ministers from trying to invent any new policies. That is to
the good. Most policies, especially on crime, are neutral. Some, such as the
elements of the government's own brand-new criminal justice bill that the
home secretary reversed last week, may be positively harmful. Few do any
good.
The figures tell the tale. Between 1979 and 1991 the government increased
the number of police officers by 12 per cent. This enhanced force succeeded
in putting 8 per cent more people in prison. It was a wasted effort. For
during the same period the number of recorded crimes rose by 112 per cent.
This does not mean that the actual number of crimes more than doubled.
Criminal statistics are the most misleading of all measures of anti-social
behaviour. People have become increasingly willing to report break-ins,
rapes and the like; the police are more assiduous at writing entries in the
book. Yet even when this is taken into account we are left with the
impression that during the 1980s there was a steady increase, of imprecise
amount, in crime, particularly violent crime. Anecdotal evidence supports
this view.
It is also clear that nobody has a sure-fire answer to the problem.
Professor David Pyle, senior lecturer in economics at the University of
Leicester, has produced a paper* whose depressing conclusion is that there
are few novel approaches to crime in which the benefits outweigh the costs.
It is even more depressing that the production of such a thesis has been
sponsored by Securicor Services, but that is the age in which we live.
It is, however, clearly possible to sup with Securicor and go home with an
independent mind. The best that the author can say of the privatisation of
crime prevention is that the case is 'not proven'. The professor looks at
neighbourhood watch schemes, electronic tagging and the privatisation of
prisons. 'There may be dangers,' he says, 'in placing too much reliance on
the private sector in this field.' Policing, which is a 'public good' should
be financed through 'compulsory public subscription'.
Prof Pyle is no kinder to us soppy old liberals. For he tells us that the
remedies popular in the bar-room do apparently work. Various studies
demonstrate that increases in the certainty and severity of punishment can
be effective in reducing crime. This may be news to the Home Office, if not
to its political head. As to which is better, 'certainty' or 'severity', the
conventional wisdom is again challenged. The rise in police strength
necessary to make it more likely that criminals will be caught is seen as
less cost-effective than simply sending more offenders to prison, for longer
periods. This will be disputed by those whose basic discipline is sociology
rather than economics. Liberals will, however, enjoy his finding that
'recorded property crime is much more closely related to the level of
economic activity in England and Wales than had previously been thought'.
One remedy does stand out. Most crimes of violence are caused by
drunkenness; the majority occur after pub closing time, especially at
weekends. Prof Pyle postulates a market solution, namely raising the price
of alcohol. This might be reinforced by encouraging the sale of low-alcohol
beers and wines; his analogy is the differential tax that has brought about
a switch to unleaded petrol. 'There seems to be no reason why such a policy
would prove to be ineffective, even if, as seems likely, the demand for
alcoholic drink is price inelastic,' he writes. Mr Clarke is the ideal
minister to propound such a scheme. 'Common sense,' he would mutter. 'Stands
to reason.' It could do both him, and our Saturday nights, a modicum of
good.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Cambodian Elections: Ballot despite the bullets - Cambodia's
continuing civil war is unlikely to stop Sunday's election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The calendar on the wall of a Pakistani-manned UN police station north of
Phnom Penh has only one entry for May 23: 'Election - Inshallah (God
willing).' In spite of a continuing civil war, in spite of the failure to
implement the peace plan signed by the four main Cambodian factions in Paris
in 1991, and in spite of threatened attacks on polling stations by Khmer
Rouge guerrillas, the United Nations is grimly determined to go ahead with
Sunday's election.
Nearly Dollars 2bn has been committed to one of the UN's costliest and most
criticised peacekeeping operations. Short of an overwhelming upsurge of
violence, it is unlikely that the UN will risk further attacks on its
performance by cancelling or postponing the election, being contested
principally by the government communist party (the Cambodian People's party
or CPP) and the royalist party, Funcinpec.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, who leads the 22,000 peacekeepers of the UN Transitional
Authority in Cambodia (Untac), said yesterday that political parties had
held more than 1,500 peaceful meetings during the six-week campaign period,
but admitted that the five-day elections would be held in less than
satisfactory conditions.
'We are going through this important chapter in the history of Cambodia, in
the history of south-east Asia, in the history of the UN itself,' Mr Akashi
told Untac staff this week in a rousing pre-election pep-talk. The election
itself would be 'fairly respectable and credible', he added.
But the obstacles to a 'free and fair election' in Cambodia in the 'neutral
political environment' outlined in the Paris peace accords have been evident
for many months. Untac was charged with monitoring a ceasefire, but the two
principal combatants - the Khmer Rouge and the Phnom Penh administration
installed by Vietnam in 1979 - never stopped fighting. Untac's mandate was
confined to peacekeeping, not peacemaking, and it was not allowed to impose
peace by force of arms.
The Khmer Rouge also denied Untac access to most of its strongholds in the
north-west and refused to disarm its guerrillas or regroup them in
cantonment areas in accordance with the peace plan. With Khmer Rouge
fighters still at large, the other factions decided to keep their own
soldiers armed.
This year the Khmer Rouge withdrew from the peace process altogether and
threatened to disrupt the election; the government, meanwhile, mounted a
campaign of assassination and intimidation against its remaining election
rivals, which Untac was unable to stop.
Mr Akashi managed to persuade Funcinpec, which says at least 50 of its
supporters and officials have been killed, and the Buddhist Liberal
Democratic party (BLDP) to stay in the running; their withdrawal would have
further undermined the election's credibility.
But even if it is deemed reasonably fair, with no serious outbreaks of
violence or vote-rigging, the election's outcome is not guaranteed to bring
peace to Cambodia, or to allow the UN to withdraw with its reputation
intact.
Consider the options. If the government wins, it will achieve the
international recognition and foreign aid denied it since the Vietnamese
invaded and overthrew the Khmer Rouge regime 14 years ago. France and Russia
both favour a government victory.
Mr Hun Sen, the prime minister, says that if the government wins, it will
treat Khmer Rouge guerrillas as 'armed bandits'. The idea would be to wear
down the Khmer Rouge until it becomes a containable left-wing insurgency
that can be eventually defeated.
The newly-elected government would still be riddled with corruption. But,
like its patron in neighbouring Vietnam, it would probably be quick to
accept economic reforms and might even adapt to the democratic ideals
enshrined in the Paris peace plan in coming years.
Unfortunately, many Cambodians and western diplomats doubt that the
government would be able to crush the Khmer Rouge. If the CPP wins, the
opposition parties are likely to cry foul and point to the UN's own numerous
reports of government human rights abuses and intimidation during the
campaign. Some defeated opposition leaders may even join the Khmer Rouge, as
they did in the years before the peace agreement.
'If the CPP wins, we've got another Angola on our hands,' says one UN
election officer, referring to the decision by Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Angolan
opposition leader, to resume fighting after the communist government in
Luanda won the Angolan election.
While the Khmer Rouge guerrilla force is not thought strong enough to hold
important towns, it has used the 19 months since the peace deal to enlarge
its presence in the countryside, partly by seizing territory from other
factions.
Though China may have stopped backing the Khmer Rouge, Thai generals and
businessmen remain its staunch supporters. The elusive Pol Pot, leader of
the Khmer Rouge, has a house in eastern Thailand and has close relations
with the Thai military.
The government is by no means certain to win. A Funcinpec victory would at
least convince most observers that the election result was fair. Funcinpec
has only a vestigial army and has been on the receiving end of
government-sanctioned attacks on its campaign workers and supporters.
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the Funcinpec leader, has promised to try to
appoint his father Prince Sihanouk as the Cambodian president if his party
wins. Prince Sihanouk, backed by China, has spoken of the need to bring all
four factions, including the Khmer Rouge, into a government of national
reconciliation.
However, few believe that if Funcinpec wins the government - with more than
200,000 soldiers, policemen, and militiamen - will hand over power to a
party which it regards as infiltrated and easily influenced by the Khmer
Rouge.
'The UN must make sure that power will be transferred to whoever wins the
election,' says a somewhat hopeful Mr Ung Huot, the Funcinpec election
campaign manager.
If the election proceeds and results emerge on schedule in early June, even
an outright winner may decide that it is wiser to form a coalition
government. As one western diplomat puts it: 'We are not going to wake up on
May 31 and find ourselves with an ideal political situation.'
Untac's mandate is due to expire in August, and pressure is mounting for a
withdrawal because of the rising cost and the dangers to UN staff. But many
UN officials believe some kind of presence will be required for the
foreseeable future no matter who wins the election. For Mr Akashi, who once
described his job as suitable for a 'masochist', the pain is not yet over.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Letter: Importance of whaling to Japanese society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr FUMIO YOSHINO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Although Robert Thomson's several articles (Whaling ban wins strong US
backing, May 11; Whale sanctuary vote set for today, May 12; and Japan irked
by rejection of whale plan, May 14) were all informative and objective, I
nevertheless feel that additional information is needed in order to inform
non-Japanese readers about the tradition and importance of whale meat in
Japanese society.
It now appears to the average Japanese person that a fever called
'environmental protection' has dominated the International Whaling
Commission seminar in Kyoto.
Of course, Japanese people fully realise that the whaling ban proposal does
not stem from any hostility towards our race.
However, what we are uneasy about is the implicit lack of understanding of
our way of living.
Japan's fish catch was 96.9kg per person in 1991 compared to 14.9kg per
person in the UK and 19.8kg in the US.
Nevertheless, the level of imports of marine products in this country
exceeds that of our exports by more than three times.
Our daily calorie intake comprises 13.1 per cent of marine products,
compared to 17.7 per cent of meat such as beef, pork and poultry. (Seaweed,
which the Japanese love and consume in large amounts, has no calories.)
The consumption of whale meat in Japan can perhaps be likened to the
consumption of snails in France. Without snails no Frenchman would die, but
to take away this cherished foodstuff would no doubt cause great commotion
and much disgruntlement.
Japanese people realise that this peculiar dish is a speciality to a
particular country, but we would never consider doing away with the custom
of eating such a dish.
The Japanese are said to have a history of whaling dating back to before
Christ, although we only began eating meat roughly 100 years ago, after
centuries of abstinence for religious reasons.
Since the introduction of meat into Japan, our tastes have certainly
changed. We now consume more than twice the amount of meat that we did 20
years ago.
The opinion that the whale is a great symbol of nature and that the mammal
is some kind of higher form of animal seems strange to me.
I feel that the only hope of proceeding with discussions at the seminar in
Kyoto is to base them on a mutual understanding of different ways of living.
Otherwise the commission would simply be a witchhunt by culturally less
intelligent people who could not accept other peoples' values.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Letter: Headline earnings per share figure may allow
confusion and manipulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RON PATERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I see that your published company statistics will in future use the
'headline' earnings per share figure proposed by the Institute for
Investment Management and Research, which broadly seeks to distinguish
trading results from capital items. You are confident that their formula
provides a 'factual and robust' basis for the statistics on which your
readers rely. That may not be entirely justified.
Your decision has no doubt been provoked by dissatisfaction with the
all-embracing earnings per share figure now required by FRS3. However, the
Accounting Standards Board chose that figure precisely because the headline
numbers which many people prefer cannot deliver what they promise.
As my firm has commented to the IIMR, headline earnings per share will not
in practice be 'factual and robust'. That is because the seemingly
attractive theoretical distinction between trading performance and capital
gains and losses does not work in practice.
An example concerns the costs of closing down a business. The headline
earnings per share figure is supposed to exclude the costs of discontinuing
the business, but to include trading results during the run down period.
This distinction will often be meaningless, if not impossible to make.
There is a danger that earnings per share figures based on these
distinctions will be misunderstood and that misconceptions about the
'important' figures in accounts will be created. Experience has shown that
focusing on an intermediate figure in the profit and loss account tends only
to corrupt the figure itself. In making this change, you are in danger of
putting the clock back and undermining the ASB's efforts to promote a deeper
analysis of accounts rather than reliance on a simplistic and manipulable
ratio.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Letter: UK shipbuilding policy riddled with anomaly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JOHN TOMANEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial ('Swan song', May 17) arguing that the downfall of Swan
Hunter was inevitable is flawed.
Despite assertions to the contrary, the argument that there is too much
shipbuilding capacity in the UK does not stand scrutiny. A reasonable level
of success in export markets, together with the Ministry of Defence's plans
to procure further logistics and assault vessels as well as Type 23
frigates, suggests that the market will provide enough work for all the
warship yards. Indeed, some observers fear that government procurement
strategy may be creating a potential capacity shortage, especially of design
and technical skills, later in the decade. The government should take
account of this possibility in its dealings with the sector.
Your editorial also ignores both the fact that Swan Hunter has a record of
producing merchant ships and that most predictions are for this market to
grow in the 1990s, largely because of the ageing of the world fleet.
Swan Hunter is the only UK yard that has a record of producing both merchant
vessels and the full range of military vessels in its own right. As a
monopsonist in the naval sector, the government should have made this a
factor in its decision to order the helicopter carrier. More importantly, it
should make this a consideration in the vital effort to save shipbuilding on
the Tyne.
The position of the government is riddled with anomaly and inconsistency. It
allowed a consortium that included Kvaerner, a merchant yard whose contracts
have been supported with intervention funding, to compete with Swan Hunter,
whose diversification efforts were hindered by the government's refusal to
support an application for intervention funding for the yard. As a
consequence Swan Hunter's very future depended on winning naval orders. Good
luck to Kvaerner, but where is the logic in all of this?
Finally, your implication that because UK yards struggled to maintain market
share in the past, the UK should withdraw from shipbuilding, seems neatly to
encapsulate the reasoning that has underpinned the manufacturing decline
that is at the heart of the UK's economic problem.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Letter: Simpler way to encourage use of Ecu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BEN COLEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lord Cobbold suggests some interesting ideas for easing the
introduction of a single European currency ('How to make the Ecu
user-friendly', May 12). A simpler way of encouraging use of the Ecu might
be to improve the general ability of companies, particularly smaller ones,
to manage their foreign exchange exposure and, in so doing, show them how
the Ecu can be useful now.
While many large firms already use the Ecu to hedge against overseas
exposures, smaller ones are often unaware of even basic Treasury management
techniques and of the Ecu-based services their local bank offers.
A study we undertook for the European Commission last year revealed that
most EC banks offer a comprehensive range of Ecu-based services. It should
be easy to set up an Ecu bank account for payments made to and received from
several EC countries, thus reducing exchange costs. Equally, assuming
overseas purchasers agree, there are few problems to invoicing in Ecus,
which lessens the risks of volatile exchange rates. The main obstacle is
ignorance.
Both the Commission, as promoter of the Ecu, and our own resurgent
Department of Trade and Industry, as promoters of overseas trade, might like
to consider how they could assist small firms to manage foreign currency
exposure better.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Arts: St Petersburg Philharmonic - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The death of Tybalt is one of the most dramatic sections of Prokofiev's
Romeo and Juliet, but this performance was determined to outdo any other. As
the mortal blows struck, the conductor Mariss Jansons leapt in the air,
slashing at each chord with vicious stabs of his baton, driving the music
brutally, violently, decisively, to its grim and noisy conclusion. By the
end Tybalt was well and truly dead.
That was the spine-tingling end to the first half of the St Petersburg
Philharmonic Orchestra's concert on Wednesday. It was the orchestra's only
appearance in London on this tour and so there should not have been any
empty seats - certainly not the rows of vacant places visible upstairs at
the Barbican. Surely the message has got round that this is still a
marvellous orchestra and Jansons a conductor unrivalled today for sheer
excitement?
Any implication that their performances together are merely over-dramatised
must quickly be put to rest. The Prokofiev was high on adrenalin, as was
Rakhmaninov's Second Symphony after the interval, but half the intensity
comes from the scrupulous way in which Jansons has rehearsed the orchestra,
so that every note, every dot and dash of the score is in the right place.
(I do not refer here to the cuts in the symphony's finale, where many pages
were missing completely.)
The ensemble was exact. The inner ear of the orchestra balances the music
superbly. Yet for much of the evening the playing sounded mushy. Why? Part
of the reason will probably have been the unusual layout of the instruments,
which put first violins and basses (top and bottom of the aural spectrum) on
the left, middle strings and brass together on the right - an arrangement
which clearly did not work.
The rest, I fear, was down to the Barbican's acoustics, which not for the
first time scuppered a visiting orchestra's best efforts. It was very
noticeable that nothing sounded better than the opening of the slow
movement, where the exemplary solo clarinet was accompanied by rustling
violas and pizzicato basses. As soon as the rest of the orchestra came in,
clarity and focus of sound were lost as cross-echoes bounced back and forth.
For a performance of this symphony that had passion, lack of indulgence, an
absolute grip on the music from first to last, it would be difficult to
improve upon this conductor and the St Petersburg Philharmonic. If only the
swashbuckling Jansons could have slayed the Barbican acoustics while he was
about it.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Arts: Enterprising 'Soundbites]' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BOC Covent Garden Festival, a highly various affair, got underway this
week. At the Donmar Warehouse on Tuesday and Wednesday we had 'Soundbites]'
There was loose talk in advance about the commissioned '10-minute' pieces;
in fact the norm for the five mini-operas - three commissioned, two older
pieces by Gerald Barry and the late Stephen Oliver - was about twice as long
as that. The company was the ENO's Contemporary Opera Studio (artistic
director David Pountney), whose musical director David Barry and the
producer and designer David Fielding achieved more than creditable results
for every work.
The composers, it seemed, were allowed to draw upon only a modest band:
string quartet, flute, clarinet, harp and keyboards. In fact Sally Beamish
used only three of them for her Ease, and Barry's 1977 The Garden just a
whimsical cello and piano. But the striking thing (so to speak) was the
absence of any percussion whatever, unless you counted the typewriters in
Ease: even five years ago, I believe, the notion that a bunch of young
composers might forgo percussion would have seemed wildly improbable.
There was not a single synthesiser to be heard, nor any taped sounds; there
were TV sets in David Horne's Jason Field, but their screens showed nothing.
And where the teenage opera-composers reviewed here (glumly) by Andrew
Clements last week resorted wholesale to minimalism - it enables you to
write many more minutes of music with much less effort - there was no trace
of that at the Donmar. Barry's Things that gain by being painted does offer
minimal music in another sense; its quaint text, drawn from a 10th-century
Japanese pillow book (and mostly spoken), is really all, and the
instrumental duo supplies only airy asides.
As the snobbish aesthete-heroine, Jacqueline Horner was encouraged toward
theatrical over-statement, where a more innocent manner might allow us to
relish her comic self-revelation more. Cooler impersonations by Lynne Davies
and Andrew MacKenzie-Wicks, as bereaved wife and mysterious gardener, served
The Garden better. As often with Oliver, the score sounded fluently
effective, without promising that further acquaintance would discover
anything more strongly coherent.
Ease is a punning title, for its 'E's are the suicidal Emma Bovary and
Eleanor Marx, who made the first English translation of Flaubert's novel. In
Edward Kemp's text they become ghostly, anguished intimates, to no great
purpose, though Miss Davies and Margaret Preece enacted them with fervour.
The Beamish score sports some interesting, short-breathed ideas of its own,
but scarcely turns the situation into music-drama. At different, confident
extremes, the music of Horne's Jason Field and Colin Huehns' Solid Assets
lent far more vital charges to their texts.
In the former, a 27-year-old labourer meets - perhaps only in imagination -
the parents of a 12-year-old boy he has murdered. In the cast-list they
appear simply as Mother, Father and Son, which suggests how their
instinctive family roles will reach across the dreadful confrontation.
Overlapping sung lines left many details inaudible; but in any case, what
Horne has through-composed is really a dramatic cantata a tre, one with an
instrumental ensemble as prominent and as urgently expressive as the voices.
The idiom is up-to-date but palatable and clear, and respectful of British
tradition (he is a Scot): it struck me that Jason Field seemed a natural
descendant of, say, Vaughan Williams' On Wenlock Edge.
Huehns is plainly a natural theatre composer. Meredith Oakes's rhyming text
for Solid Assets is a wry, neatly amusing sketch, and Huehns finds bright
musical touches, sometimes bare-faced devices, for bringing it all to crisp
life.
As a 'gross', middle-aged art-lover who is happy to pay millions for an
ancient Egyptian piece that is now less than dust, the baritone Karl Morgan
Daymond was no less apt and sonorous than as the homicidal young hunk in
Jason Field: this singer has a fine career before him. The role of the
art-dealer allowed MacKenzie-Wicks at last to exercise his lyrical tenor to
best effect, and Miss Horner made a doughty art-widow. Huehns is bound to go
off in some enterprising direction; it will be interesting to learn which
one he chooses.
Festival sponsored by the BOC Group, with support from Guardian Royal
Exchange and American Express

FT  21 MAY 93 / Arts: The Nederlands Dans Theatre 2 - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nederlands Dans Theater has a second, smaller, younger ensemble, NDT2, made
up of dancers who are being groomed to join the main troupe. (NDT3, you may
recall, also exists - a ghetto of performers who are identified as being old
but still able to function on stage. The mind shrinks from the idea of what
might be found in an NDT4.) NDT2 is at Sadler's Wells with a repertory all
too familiar in its concerns. 'Never mind the steps; think of the message'
is the motto for the NDT companies, but moral worth and, I suspect,
political correctness, are fatal ingredients for choreography.
I saw the second of two programmes on offer this week, and though it
proposed the work of four choreographers, there was little differentiation
between the pieces. Hans van Manen's Shorthand found three men and three
women in figure-hugging shiny black plastic leotards - they looked like
animated caviar - who struggled, posed, made duets (one, of course, for a
couple of chaps) and behaved in rather stolid, and possibly Dutch, fashion.
These activities sat rather oddly with Stravinsky's Gesualdo score, but I do
not find that musical aptness is the banner under which NDT often sails.
Two other works - Ohad Naharin's Passomezzo and Jiri Kylian's Stoolgame - I
have reported on before. The first is an awkward courtship ritual between a
hideously dressed couple - she tries to get her man with a display of
sagging limbs and very determined winter underwear; he has forgotten to put
on his trousers - while Tudor songs are sung. It lasts, thank Heaven, only
ten minutes. The second is grimly determined about an individual fighting
with a group and turning into a martyr, while a tiresome sound-track by Arne
Nordheim is played. (The music is probably ideal for NDT because it was
assembled as a result of Nordheim's having seen Soviet troops preparing to
crush the Prague Spring uprising.) The angst hangs heavy on the vine.
The closing piece of the programme is Paul Lightfoot's Step Lightly, in
which four girls and two men fling themselves about on the ground - like Old
Man River, they just keep rolling along - and suggest that they are enjoying
really juicy nervous break-downs. It is accompanied by Bulgarian folk songs
performed with steel-cutting timbre by a women's chorus. (My own belief is
that peasantry are better employed doing something useful in the fields.)
Much of this nonsense would be inadmissible were it not that the NDT2
dancers are very impressive. The men are uniformly excellent, moving with
big, flashing dynamics, taut and clear in energy. Among them Urtzi Aranburu
and Miguel Rodriguez are exceptionally fine. The women are pleasing - if
generally less challenged by the choreography - and in Step Lightly I was
very taken by the airiness and delicacy of Catherine Riesi's dancing. They
all deserve better things.
NDT 2 is at Sadler's Wells until May 22

FT  21 MAY 93 / Arts: Uncomfortable installations - Lynn MacRitchie reviews
the disturbing work of Mona Hatoum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The exhibition of the work of Mona Hatoum at the Arnolfini Gallery in
Bristol demonstrates that it is possible to observe the progression and
growth associated with work in the more conventional media such as painting
and sculpture just as clearly in the work of an artist who has so far chosen
to work in those media generally considered more extreme - performance,
video and installation. Examples of Hatoum's video works of the 1980s are
included in the exhibition, along with new installation pieces and smaller
objects, giving an excellent opportunity to study the progression over a
decade of the work of an artist committed to exploring some of the darker
aspects of the human condition.
While her subject matter is frequently disturbing, Hatoum is quite clear
where the priority in her work lies. 'In the process of developing a piece
of work, I go through a rigorous paring down of all that is superfluous to
arrive at a precise and contained form. Always in my work, in all its
manifestations, whether it is performance, video or installation work,
formal considerations are of primary importance.'
Hatoum is a Palestinian, born in Beirut, who studied in London at the Byam
Shaw and Slade schools from 1975 to 1981, thus finding herself safe while
her family faced the horrors of civil war. An enduring theme of her work,
whether expressed quite obviously in her early performances, in which she
endured actual discomfort and pain and not a little danger or in the latest
installation pieces, is the expression of physical and mental unease.
In earlier pieces this was equated with her own disablement through
blindfolding or entrapment in containers of mud or plastic body bags, while
the spectator looked on uncomfortably, hoping that actual injury would not
be the price of the artist's dedication to this particular choice of formal
means to manifest her explorations of torment and fear.
In the new installation pieces, the spectator is almost further confounded,
experiencing in their own person the dislocations and conundrums the works
use to such powerful effect. I doubt whether anyone approaching 'The light
at the end' made in 1989 and exhibited at the Hayward Gallery in 1990 as
part of The British Art Show will forget their moment of real fear on
approaching the six red neon strips suspended between a metal frame at the
end of a dimly lit enclosed space and discovering that the piece did not
just resemble a grid of radiating elements but was in fact exactly that, the
sensation of growing heat and danger as one approached not counterfeit but
only too real.
Her recent installations, while not involving actual danger, still pack a
physical punch. At the Arnolfini, the first room contains a new work, at
first glance an exemplary minimalist composition. Sheets of thick plate
glass fill the space between two iron girders which support the roof. The
wall to the right is covered in sheets of metal, of the same proportion as
the sheets of glass. Both glass and metal are studded with smaller metal
plugs, marking off the space at regular intervals in a grid pattern. It is
not certain whether these have a structural function, or are entirely
decorative. Nor is it certain why their outline, unlike that of the larger
elements, is unclear. Closer inspection - for the ambiguity of the shapes
invites closer inspection  - reveals that they are small magnets, thick with
iron filings, their role as spatial indicators subverted by their other,
inescapable function as part of a natural and ineluctable process.
Nothing is at it seems: even the calm perfection of minimalism, the artist
reminds us, must in the end be subject to the darker forces of nature, just
as we, as human beings, are subject to the darker forces which make us into
the persecutors of our fellows.
Those who do not wish to journey to Bristol may see its second large scale
piece, 'Light Sentence', concurrently exhibited in London, where it forms
part of the Serpentine's 'Four Rooms' exhibit of installation works. It is
simply constructed, of ready-made industrial elements, wire mesh lockers and
a bare light bulb. The lockers are arranged to form a curve, at the centre
of which the bulb ascends and descends, controlled by a motor. Its motion,
almost imperceptible in itself, causes a mesmerising pattern of ever
shifting shadows to be traced on the enclosing walls, enveloping the shadow
of the spectator within their traces.
In the elegant spaces of the Arnolfini, the work is menacing but also richly
beautiful. At the Serpentine, its windows blocked off to accommodate the
piece, darkness and threat become its most powerful characteristics, the
haunting beauty of the play of light becoming secondary to a menacing sense
of enclosure. Our shadows are part of its structure: we have been trapped in
our admiration, complicit in an experience which is darker than it seems.
Mona Hatoum, Arnolfini Gallery, until 6 June. 16 Narrow Quay, Bristol, BS1
4QA, telephone 0272 299191.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Arts: Nanci Griffith, country girl - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nanci Griffith was a school teacher before she became the self-appointed
guardian of country music. And don't you know it. Her Wednesday night
appearance at the Albert Hall was as much a lecture as a concert.
Not that it was boring: Griffith is too much of an enthusiast, and too,
well, odd for that. She has a Texan drawl that stretches into Oklahoma. She
also has a disarmingly mimsy speaking voice which miraculously converts into
a resonant toe curler when she finally gets around to singing.
But the most mesmerising thing about her performance is her ability to
centre the universe around her girlish shoulders. Without Nanci, you are
made to feel, country music would have gone the way of the drawing room
ballad. Fortunately she has playing the guitars in her band both the
'greatest acoustic guitar player in my life time' as well as 'my favourite
singer-songwriter'. It was a relief that the percussionist's life time
achievement was that he came from Hemel Hempstead.
The whole performance is one long roll call of inspirations and good
friends. We learn, rather remarkably, that Nanci, and the equally decorative
Emmylou Harris, spend their New Year Eves playing lonesome country duets.
Other singers actually dropped in on the concert. Carolyn Hester, the primal
force behind Griffiths decision to go on the road, turned up to chorus on
'Boots of Spanish Leather', and a crinkly Ralph McTell was happy to share
the verses on Nanci's latest single 'From Clare to Here', which he wrote. By
the final rousing version of 'Its a hard life wherever you go', the eleven
musicians on stage had even been joined by the guitar tuner.
Actually Nanci Griffith has good reasons to present herself as the
incarnation of country. She was plugging a latest album 'Other voices, Other
rooms', which is devoted to songs by contemporaries and precursors, one
precursor stretching back to 1877. It made for a strange blend of the
personal and the universal. We learned a great deal of Nanci Griffiths
experiences with the security system at Dallas Airport; we also heard her
covers of fine songs by Tom Paxton and Townes Van Zandt.
It has taken Nanci Griffith many years to reach her current eminence. For
decades her songs were hits for others; now in repaying the compliment she
has somehow appropriated the entire country music catalogue. The audience
sat in quiet reverence. Griffith has obviously moved swiftly from school
teacher, to head mistress, to chairman of the governors. There is a great
deal of steel inside the frock.
Nanci Griffith is touring the country until early July

Were it not for Brookside (Channel 4, 8.30pm) you could tonight happily
part-exchange the TV for a take-away pizza. Will Mandy Jordache finally
confess she has stabbed her husband to death? Can the producers find such a
good plot-line again?
Measure For Measure (BBC2, 9.30pm) is an excellent programme dealing with an
off-beat subject - measurement - but even it is not good enough to keep this
viewer tuned into Have I Got News For You (BBC2, 10pm), which has definitely
lost the spark of the previous series. Paul Merton is terribly funny but
seems bored with it all; Ian Hislop is now just smug; pretty-boy Angus
Deayton probably no longer needs the money.
You need to sit up till midnight for the good stuff. Rock Docs: Three Steps
to Heaven (BBC2, 12.10am) is a repeat of an Arena documentary on rock 'n
roller Eddie Cochran. Five minutes later there is The Quatermass Experiment
(Channel 4, 12.15am), a vintage Hammer movie.

EDMUND NUTTALL has won a Pounds 4m contract from Peterhead Bay Authority to
construct a new jetty and breakwater in Peterhead Harbour, in the Grampian
region of Scotland. The jetty is to provide berthing facilities for North
Sea service vessels, while the breakwater will give protection to a future
marina development planned for the harbour area.
The main works involve the construction of a reinforced concrete jetty 170
metres long and 23 metres wide, supported on tubular steel piles. The
breakwater will consist of a 250-metre long layered rubble mound.
Associated works include dredging and rock removal, the placement of graded
fill over the existing foreshore and sea bed to reclaim a 180 x 40 metre
storage area and a marina base area. Sheet piling, and electrical and
drainage provisions will also be undertaken.
The location of the works is to the west end of the ASCO (Aberdeen Service
Company) south base berths within Peterhead Bay harbour.

Lord Parkinson, 61, the former Conservative minister of transport, is taking
over as chairman of Starmin, the quarry products group in which the Abdullah
brothers, Raschid and Osman, have a substantial interest.
Starmin, which has a market capitalisation of Pounds 16.8m and has just
reported an after-tax loss of Pounds 8.5m for 1992 after heavy asset write
downs, has been hard hit by the recession.
However, its balance sheet is stronger than many of its smaller rivals and
it is understood that Lord Parkinson is keen to take advantage of expansion
opportunities.
Lord Parkinson, a former non-executive director of Tarmac, joined Starmin
just over a year ago as deputy chairman.
He will take over from the current chairman Owen Rout, a former senior
executive with Barclays Bank. Rout, 63, who has been chairman for three
years, will remain on the board as non-executive deputy chairman.

What type of Guinness are you - draught or overdraft? British Nuclear Fuels'
chairman, John Guinness, 57, (right) is used to being asked the question and
is rather proud of the fact that he has reasserted his ties with the
overdraft side of the family by becoming a non-executive director of
Guinness Mahon, the city merchant bank founded by Robert Rundell Guinness.
His father and grandfather were partners in the bank and his elder brother,
Sir Howard, spent a couple of years there before joining S G Warburg.
However, John Guinness is not the family's sole representative in the bank,
now owned by Japan's Bank of Yokohama.
Tim Guinness, 45, joint managing director of Guinness Flight Asset
Management, has kept the family name alive, but he's a descendant of the
brewing side.

<TEXT>
lMS International, a division of the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corporation, has
chosen TILBURY DOUGLAS as its preferred contractor to complete a new
corporate office in Marylebone, under a Pounds 14m design and build
contract.
The nine-storey development at 1-9 Harewood Avenue will provide the client
with 85,000 sq ft of office facility, 15 residential units and space for
basement car parking.
The construction works pose a number of challenges that will require
innovative solutions by Tilbury Douglas. The building is already partly
constructed.
The first task of Tilbury Douglas's design and build team will be to
evaluate the condition of the existing building structure, fabric and
services.
Access will be restricted as the site of the inner city development is
bounded by adjoining properties on two sides.
The offices will incorporate a high content of mechanical and electrical
services.
The contract includes all internal finishings and fitting out of the office
and reception areas and will administered on behalf of lMS International by
Monk Dunstone Associates.

FT  21 MAY 93 / People: Linx to listen carefully
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Linx Printing Technologies, the manufacturer of continuous ink jet printing
equipment that issued a profits warning on Tuesday, has parted company with
its sales and marketing director, John Shead.
The parting was 'amicable' according to Linx chief executive, Derek Harris,
but follows recognition that the group's sales strategy had gone astray in
Europe.
Replacing Shead is John Cetti, who has spent eight years building from
scratch the European ink jet business of Videojet, a company based in the US
but controlled by GEC of the UK.
Videojet appears to have been among the companies taking market share from
Linx and the other UK-quoted ink jet printer maker, Domino Printing Sciences
 -which six weeks ago also issued a profits warning.
While Linx and Domino may have run into trouble meeting their plans, they
will both be aware of another UK competitor. Willett, a private Northampton
company with sales of Pounds 50m, says sales of its wider range of products
including ink jet printers are still growing in Europe, possibly as a result
of selling through subsidiaries rather than through foreign distributors.
Harris said Cetti's arrival is the first stage of a reorganisation in Europe
that has yet to take a firm shape. 'We have to listen carefully to what John
says now,' he says.
Cetti will have responsibility for Linx worldwide sales and marketing
operations.

FT  21 MAY 93 / People: Sir Bernard Ashley's flowery farewell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Bernard Ashley yesterday stepped down as chairman of Laura Ashley, the
international clothing and home furnishings group, 40 years after the
business was founded by his wife. His departure marks an end of an era for
the company, and the symbolic completion of its transition from family-owned
business to public company.
Sir Bernard was also reported to have sold about a quarter of the Ashley
family's 49 per cent shareholding in the company yesterday. He had
previously said he planned progressively to reduce the stake to about 25 per
cent.
Although some other members of the Ashley family are involved in PR
activities, none of them has an active role in running the company, which
will now be headed by Jim Maxmin, the American chief executive, and Hugh
Blakeway Webb, who moves up from deputy chairman to chairman.
Sir Bernard's departure was not unexpected, after the company admitted last
month that he had not attended a board meeting since last May, and was
devoting increasing amounts of time to his hotel interests in Wales and the
US.
Laura Ashley said yesterday Sir Bernard had intended to retire for some
time, and decided the 40th anniversary year was an appropriate time to do
so, especially now the company seemed to be staging a recovery after several
years of losses. He will become honorary life president and remain a
non-executive director, as well as being involved in 'conceptual design'.
Hugh Blakeway Webb, a former barrister and partner of accountants Deloitte
Haskins &amp; Sells joined the company as deputy chairman in 1991 and has
frequently represented Sir Bernard at board meetings. He has been an adviser
to the family for some years and was involved in the 1985 floatation. He
also helped negotiate the minority investment by the Aeon group, setting the
company back on a firm financial footing, and was involved in assembling the
present management team.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Management: The Major problem with quiet leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VISIONARY, charismatic, inspirational, extrovert, relentlessly energetic and
assertive, even autocratic and arrogant. That, in a cliche-clad nutshell, is
most people's picture of the effective leader, whether in politics, the
military, or business.
Consider a representative list of such leaders: Churchill, Kennedy, De
Gaulle, Thatcher, Montgomery, MacArthur, Alfred Sloan, Jack Welch, Lee
Iacocca, John Harvey-Jones, Anita Roddick.
But what about Dwight D. Eisenhower and Harry S. Truman? To quote the
inimitable Peter Drucker, they were singularly effective yet 'possessed no
more charisma than a dead mackerel'. Nor, in the usually accepted sense of
the word (charisma, not mackerel), did Abraham Lincoln, Clement Attlee -
Britain's first post-war prime minister - or Konrad Adenauer. In our day the
same goes, for such manifestly successful and 'transformational' business
leaders as Donald Petersen, ex-chairman of worldwide Ford, Geoffrey Whalen
of British Peugeot-Talbot, Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy of Kingfisher (UK
Woolworths) and - arguably - Sir Christopher Hogg of Courtaulds and Reuters.
All are shy and at best are average communicators on a public platform. Some
are downright grey: the remarkably successful Mulcahy has been dubbed
'Mogadon Man'. Most are keener to listen and consult than to hold forth and
believe strongly in team leadership.
Which brings us to the unfortunate and accident-prone John Major, Britain's
nice prime minister. Over the past fortnight he has been vilified as never
before - for possessing what appear, at first sight, to be similar
characteristics and style of my second group of heroes.
How come the paradox? Does what works in business fall flat in politics? Or
is Major a Petersen or Mulcahy in the making, if only his critics will get
off his back?
Sadly for Major, he is less similar to the second cast-list than his
admirers might think. The most obvious contrast is with Hogg.
Hogg may be 'ultra-cerebral and terribly reserved' as a UK academic puts it,
and he certainly inclines to consensus rather than assertive
leadership-from-the-front. Yet he conforms completely to a description of
outstanding leaders given by Peter Senge, a US academic expert on the
subject. Rather than conventional charisma, 'What distinguishes them is the
clarity and persuasiveness of their ideas, the depth of their commitment and
their openness to continually learning more,' says Senge. 'They instil
confidence in those around them.'
To some extent, Whalen and Mulcahy also fit this picture. They may be
reticent, but at the same time their manifest drive and sense of strategic
direction - even if not quite a vision in the usual sense - create a sort of
charisma, at least among close colleagues.
Petersen had that too, but also something rather different. His 'vision' was
as much to do with reforming Ford's internal structures and processes -
creating what he called 'a teamwork dynamo' - as with achieving distinction
in the US car market, though he did that in spades. Every account of his
tenure during Ford's remarkable revival in the 1980s stresses his collegial,
listening, and 'enabling' style.
In theory, that makes Petersen the closest parallel to John Major - or,
rather, to the way Major tries to operate. Which brings us to what academics
would call the 'systems differences' between political and business
leadership.
Andrew Kakabadse, a Cranfield professor who studies business leadership in
nine countries, boils the usual long list of key attributes down to three:
'visioning'; good communications; and a 'team orientation'.
Visioning involves a degree of creativity, but also the ability to make
sense of immense 'systems detail', he says. Communications must be
consistently excellent, both internally and externally. Teamwork is more a
matter of open, thorough dialogue, than whether the final decision is taken
by consensus or autocratically.
Few leadership experts would score Major highly on clarity and consistency
of vision. Most would agree with Philip Sadler, the former head of Ashridge
Management College, that Major's goals are 'unstrung beads'. They lack the
unifying thread which a good business leader finds vital.
On the second attribute, communications, Major has demonstrably failed to
perform. Unlike reticent chief executives, who can delegate much of their
external relations downwards to specialists, or upwards to an extrovert
chairman, political leaders are only as effective as their own ability to
communicate.
It is a moot point whether Major deserves a high score on the third key
attribute, teamwork, in spite of his belief in it. Given the poor quality of
so many of his government's decisions and subsequent climbdowns - or
inconsistent refusals to compromise - it is far from clear that he is
stimulating a sufficiently thorough team dialogue. Moreover, instead of
allowing his more headstrong colleagues to take ill-considered decisions, he
should, in common with Attlee or Petersen, show he has the steel to overrule
them from time to time.
In politics as well as business, leaders who want to have staying power must
tailor their style to changing situations. At US General Electric, Jack
Welch has done that, becoming more consultative than a decade ago. Thatcher
could not recognise or accept the need and suffered the consequences.
In Major's case the question may be more whether a halfway adequate manager
can transform himself into someone who, however quietly, can galvanise
others into cohesive action. Mulcahy had a decade to do so, Petersen two.
Major has no such luxury.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Technology: The intelligent car hits the road - Crumbling
highways and congestion have forced the US to re-think transportation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The experience of driving down a US highway has not changed much over the
last 40 years.
The car models may be far more sophisticated, but motorists feel the same,
often bumpy surface under their wheels and pass through toll booths which
could easily serve as a backdrop to a film set in the 1950s.
But new technologies are about to shake up the staid world of highway
transportation in the US.
In the pipeline are such innovations as stronger, more durable concrete
surfaces and automatic sensors which collect tolls simply by debiting a
motorist's bank account.
After trailing behind Japan and Europe for years in the area of
transportation technology, the US is finally catching up and, in some cases,
moving to the cutting edge of highway innovations.
The new attention being paid to transportation is triggered by necessity.
Traffic problems are worsening, bridges and highways continue to crumble and
the cost of repair is mounting.
These factors are forcing the federal and state governments to take a hard
look at longer-lasting infrastructure.
If they succeed in extending the life of US highways, the savings could be
tremendous. The National Research Council, a privately funded research
group, estimates that improving the durability of the country's roads and
bridges by just one percentage point would yield savings to the federal
government of between Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) and Dollars 30bn over a
20-year period.
One reason that new highway technologies have been slow to take hold is that
spending on infrastructure is ultimately controlled by bureaucratic state
and federal governments.
However, the private sector, lured by government grants for research and the
promise of a mass market for transportation products, is beginning to take
on more responsibility.
State-of-the-art technology, known as 'intelligent vehicle highway systems'
(IVHS), is set to revolutionise the way Americans use their cars.
This new technology would allow car computers to gather and give off
information on everything from road conditions to the number of passengers
in the vehicle. Private and public-sector groups have formed a
Washington-based association, known as the Intelligent Vehicle Highway
Society.
Among the association's long-term goals are the installation of computerised
sensors on all federal highways to limit the number of stops a vehicle is
forced to make. These sensors would aim to eliminate toll booths by debiting
users' bank accounts as they passed through invisible borders. The sensors
would also be equipped to weigh trucks in motion and offer computerised
cargo inspection.
Once the system was in full operation, a truck could move across the
country, petrol permitting, without making a single stop.
The new sensors would be useful, not only on highways, but on urban streets
as well. In Los Angeles, a new IVHS project plans to install sensors at
4,000 intersections. The sensors would aim to minimise 'wasted green time' -
the period of time a traffic light stays green without any vehicle passing
through.
When the flow of cars slowed down, the sensors would tell the traffic light
to turn red, giving other cars at the crossing a chance to move ahead.
According to IVHS, over Dollars 200bn will be spent on these types of
systems over the next 20 years. Some 80 per cent of that investment is set
to come from the private sector and the remainder from federal and state
governments.
'The US is the only country in the world with a 20-year plan for IVHS,' says
Fred Tucker, head of the automotive division at Motorola. Private companies,
hopeful that the US can take the lead in this area, have been moving ahead
with IVHS tests, and related products, such as self-navigation systems,
should be on the market later this year.
In Orlando, Florida, General Motors and Avis, the car rental group, have
just completed a market test for self-navigating vehicles. Drivers using the
Avis cars were amused by voices that spit out directions, such as 'Turn
right at the next set of lights,' and 'You are three miles from Disneyland.'
General Motors specially produced 100 cars for the project, all equipped
with 'talking' devices to give drivers directions and computer screens
featuring maps of the area. Sensors on the cars let the computer know the
exact location of the vehicle, enabling them to guide drivers. The
experiment was so well-received that more comprehensive navigation tests are
being organised in several regions of the country.
In a project in the Chicago suburbs, about 5,000 vehicles will be equipped
with computers which will not only give directions but will also try to keep
drivers away from traffic jams. The Chicago experiment, sponsored in part by
Motorola, will not rely on specially made vehicles but, instead, on the
installation of systems similar to those the group eventually hopes to sell
on the mass market.
Motorola will collect information from the cars' computers about their
movements and relay traffic reports to their drivers.
'We'll use the computers to tell drivers about road conditions, traffic
congestion and other information,' said Joseph Ligar, who is heading the
project.
Even the most sophisticated navigation systems, though, will not help much
if the US does not move quickly to improve the condition of its roads.
A congressional report has warned that, in two years, 35 per cent of the
country's interstate roads will have outlived their useful life. Rather than
patch up the problems in piecemeal fashion, the government is investing in
new technologies to improve the roads' durability.
'The price of concrete, cement and other building materials is very small
compared with the overall cost of construction,' says Surendra Shah, a
professor of engineering at Northwestern University and a leading researcher
on innovative building materials. 'So it makes sense to use the best
material available, even if it is a little more expensive.'
Construction groups are working with a slew of new materials to expand the
lifespan of roads and bridges. Some new concretes, by using fibre and
chemical additives, are attaining strengths 10 to 25 times higher than
every-day concrete. One of the problems with concrete is that it is porous
and thus sus-ceptible to moisture-produced cracks.
Many companies have begun to use microfine particles to fill in the holes
and, thereby, to 'waterproof' roads. 'Micro-silica is extremely effective in
eliminating the permeability of concrete,' says Kenneth Rear, technology
manager at WR Grace, a big concrete maker. Concrete is also an extremely
brittle material, highly suscept-ible to cracking. To improve bonding at an
atomic level, some groups are experimenting with polymer additives such as
carbon, steel, glass fibres and poly-propyline.
These additives improve the flexibility of concrete, enabling construction
companies to use thinner layers of the material in road construction.
'This new product is just as cheap as asphalt to use and far more durable,'
says Leet Denton, president of Denton Construction in Detroit. There are
many other innovations to improve the quality of concrete.
One chemical group, Arco Chemical, is working on a chemical product which
would pre-shrink concrete before it is laid down, reducing cracking later
on.
And Denton Construction has championed fast-drying concrete which, through
the use of high-grade stone and insulation blankets, can support traffic
within four hours of being laid down.
Many of these products have come into use only recently in actual
construction; others are still in the experimental phase.
However, most transportation authorities predict an avalanche of new
innovations over the next few years. If they are right, US highways could
soon leap from 1950s' technology into the 21st century.

Researchers at Cambridge Consultants have developed an alternative to
vacuum-formed plastic trays which relies more on origami than traditional
packaging. Vacuum-formed trays are widely used in the food industry - to
separate the biscuits in a packet, for example.
The CCL method folds paper or paperboard on the production line from a
single reel of paper. The technique enables companies to change their
packaging quickly if a new product line is introduced. As plastic trays are
rarely made on the packing site, stocks have to be held and separating the
trays often has to be done manually. CCL: UK, 0223 420024.

Freezing temperatures could provide an economical way of recycling used
tyres. Aga has installed a recycling plant for the Swiss company Elude which
uses a process called cryogenic fragmentation.
The tyres are shredded and fed into a tunnel where liquid and gaseous
nitrogen cools the fragments to below -80`C. A hammer mill then pounds the
chips which separate into their components: steel, textiles and rubber
granules. The rubber granules can be used for athletics tracks and even
rubberised asphalt for road surfaces. Aga: Switzerland, 61 821 7282;

Builders and do-it-yourself enthusiasts could save both time and money with
a collapsible cement mixer, designed by a former engineer from Watford.
David Gawron's patented Gizmix replaces the traditional mixer's steel drum
with a synthetic rubber bag inside a web of telescopic tubular rods.
Packaged with the motor the mixer can be stored in a box in the corner of a
workshop or garage.
Because it is light enough to carry, it can also be taken to the upper
stories of a high-rise building without the need for a winch.
Once in production, the Gizmix should cost less than Pounds 100 to buy.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Management: Guiding lights - British companies are turning
increasingly to mentoring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Ulysses put his son in the care of his old friend Mentor while he began
his epic journey, little did he know what he was starting.
Some three thousand years later mentoring has become one of the most
fashionable areas in management development. According to a recent survey by
the Industrial Society, 40 per cent of British companies have a mentoring
scheme, and a further 20 per cent are thinking about creating one. The
subject has spawned its own jargon, specialist consultancies, conferences
and even a society with a database dedicated to mentoring.
But the idea could scarcely be simpler. A mentor is someone with experience
who offers help and knowledge to someone junior. The mentor is not the boss,
nor is he or she trying to teach anything specific. They are there to guide,
listen and advise.
There is nothing special about that; most people on the rise have had their
own career confidants, just as most senior people have had a protege or two.
Mentoring, as conceived by the human resource experts makes the process
formal and, by doing so, creates a fairer system, less subject to politics
and back scratching.
Mentoring as a science became established in the US in the 1970s, when an
article in the Harvard Business Review argued that being a mentor
distinguished a leader from a mere manager. Other US research found that top
executives who had had a mentor did better than those who had not.
In the 1980s mentoring caught on in the UK as a way of helping graduates
settle down in big companies. Now there are mentors for managers at all
levels, mentors for disadvantaged groups of employees and even mentors for
mentors.
The idea accords well with the latest management thinking: people 'own'
their development and in flat organisations, where people are no longer
being told what to do by their immediate superiors, they need others to
guide and help them.
Despite the popularity of mentoring schemes, not all have been successful.
Many of the early US efforts went wrong because they were too formal and
established so many rules for the behaviour of mentor and mentoree that the
relationship was stifled. In the UK the problem has been the reverse.
According to David Clutterbuck, director of the European Mentoring Centre,
some companies simply said 'You are a mentor, go away and mate', and then
were surprised when their schemes collapsed.
At a recent conference on mentoring organised by the Industrial Society,
Clutterbuck said the most common sources of problems occur when companies
failed to:
Prepare the mentors or mentorees properly
Set clear goals for the scheme
Set clear goals for each mentoring relationship
Provide support networks for mentors and mentorees.
BT, the telecoms group, has addressed many of these issues and has
established a large mentoring programme for its graduate engineers. The aim,
says Adam Scott, an enthusiastic mentor and a director of BT, is to avoid
the 'rather muddled experience' he had when he qualified.
Scott, in common with every mentor, was selected as someone who not only had
the necessary experience, but also had 'interpersonal skills.'
The loss of senior management time is the main cost of the scheme - Scott
estimates the six annual meetings he holds with each mentoree cost about
Pounds 1,000-Pounds 2,000. At the first meeting he sits with his mentoree at
his Apple Mac computer and they agree the terms of their relationship, its
confidentiality and the subjects to be discussed.
Scott, in common with other BT mentors has been trained in the art. So, too,
have the mentorees and the line managers, who are left out of the
relationship, but who need to understand and support what is happening.
Every three months there are meetings for both sides to discuss shared
concerns. Mentors prepare regular reports on the process and there are
support staff to solve problems. So far some 80 graduates have taken part
and about 60 per cent have asked for the relationship to be continued once
the formal two-year programme is over.
Although graduate schemes still predominate, there are an increasing number
of mentoring programmes aimed at other well-defined groups of employees. At
the Prudential, a mentoring programme has been designed for pregnant women,
to make it easier for them to return to work afterwards. Mentors are chosen
among women with similar experiences and who can help with the problems of
juggling jobs and babies, offer advice on childcare and keep the mentoree in
touch with the company during maternity leave. The Pru says the scheme has
helped retain staff in whom much has been invested and has made those who
return immediately effective in their jobs.
The Pru has had little trouble finding women prepared to be mentors, but the
same is not the case for companies establishing schemes for senior people.
Indeed, those which want mentors for their top executives frequently end up
seeking outside help.
One company that provides such a mentoring service is the consultancy GHN,
which says it has mentored senior managers from around 200 companies. 'At
the very top levels it is almost impossible to handle mentoring internally.
There are so many hidden agendas,' says Susan Block of GHN. She denies that
it matters if the mentor is ignorant of the ins and outs of the particular
company. Instead, they must be good at probing, listening and questioning
and may also need to deliver painful home truths. Such home truths do not
come cheap - a year's programme of tailor-made personal development costs
between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 10,000.
Not every senior person wanting a mentor has to hire a professional. As
Oxford Regional Health Authority has found out, some mentors are prepared to
offer their services for free, even if they do not work for the same
organisation. The authority has set up a nine-week programme for 100 chief
executives and top health managers, which includes a confidential mentoring
scheme. Each manager is responsible for finding their own mentor, who could
come from another region or an academic institution.
There are limits, though, as Gary Hoyte, who helped to set up the scheme,
admits. 'If everyone in the country needed a mentor, perhaps mentor overload
would set in. There would be a backlash, with everyone resenting the amount
of time they were spending. But we are a long way from that now.'

FT  21 MAY 93 / Survey of London Docklands (7): Activists with a fresh
spring in their step - Michael Cassell talks to some of the movers and
shakers who are helping to make Docklands work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOCKLANDS is both a very old community and a very new one. Some of the
people who live there have roots in the area which extend back for
generations; others have been there only months or years.
But, together, they have a common interest in ensuring that one of Europe's
largest development projects is a success.
For some people, the priority has been the completion and operation of vital
elements of the area's commercial infrastructure; others have been concerned
to ensure that the all-important, social aspects of a developing riverside
community attract equal attention.
Most at least agree that Docklands is beyond the point where division and
disagreement are useful. Despite inevitable, continuing friction, the
emphasis is on working together as much as possible for the benefit of the
entire community.
'We all fought with the development corporation but, if you can't beat them,
join them', says RITA BENSLEY, a lifelong docklands resident and prime mover
in the Docklands Business Initiative. It was formed last year principally to
lobby government for a go-ahead to the Jubilee line underground extension.
Mrs Bensley, despite other community commitments, jumped in to help. Though
she held many doubts about the way the area was being developed, she
believes the underground extension is vital for dockland's future.
She helped organise a petition for the extension among the local community -
which raised 2,500 signatures on the first day - and then accompanied it to
Downing Street. The government, she says, has to show its support for the
east end of London and docklands in particular, which 'many people think has
closed down'.
Mrs Bensley is also chairwoman of the Association of Island Communities, a
docklands umbrella group which has been fighting for local people for more
than 50 years. She is administrator at a local community centre and also
helps out at an old people's club room.
'The Jubilee line will bring in more employment, some of it for local
people. If it goes ahead, it will be wonderful news. The people of docklands
have been forced to live on a building site for ten years. We've had the
coffee, now its time for the cream'.
Another high-profile activist is PAT WARD, a former Barclays Bank man who
came to docklands in the mid-1980s to establish his bank's presence in the
area. Made redundant, he joined the Isle of Dogs Community Trust, becoming
its director in 1991.
The trust, which was set up in 1989, raises funds from the business
community and distributes them within the local community. It has to date
given about Pounds 200,000 to a variety of organisations. Bids for grants of
up to Pounds 1,000 are considered and the trust also has other funds to help
larger self-help projects. Mr Ward says:'We are helping to create permanent
links between local business and community which are of benefit to
everyone'.
LES WEBBER is chairman of the Docklands Business Club, which was started in
1984 by dockland's 'early settlers' when wellington boots were still the
order of the day.
Mr Webber, the club's third chairman, says it has suffered in the last 18
months, given the recession and lack of confidence in docklands. But
membership has again started to rise, with around 450 names now on the
corporate register. They include Ogilvy &amp; Mather, BT, Tate &amp; Lyle and recent
newcomers Texaco.
A prime role for the club, apart from lobbying everyone and everything from
ministers to Commons select committees on behalf of the business community,
is to encourage networking between local companies. He believes the club's
future is now secure.
Mr Webber is also well-known locally as an executive of Builder Group, the
trade press publishers, which has itself invested Pounds 8m in docklands
premises.
'I believe in banging the drum for Docklands. Unless people already here get
off their backsides and shout about the attractions, then our own investment
in the area is being eroded,' he says.
One of the single biggest investments in Docklands is London City Airport,
perched on the Royal Docks and run by WILLIAM CHARNOCK, managing director.
Mr Charnock arrived in early 1988, the year after the airport opened for
business. The controversy surrounding the airport was still in full swing
and, as the complex has expanded, its impact on the local community has been
the raw material of local newspaper headlines.
Mr Charnock charts the enormous changes at the airport which have taken
place since his arrival, and is confident that, despite the turbulence
surrounding its expansion, its future is now looking brighter. Speed of
access to the airport, despite its proximity to the city, has been
unreliable because of the weak transport links and the slim choice of
destinations has inevitably restricted its popularity. No big airline
operators have come in, and, as yet, there are no domestic, onward links.
But several new services are to be introduced in the coming months and there
will be faster access from the City following the opening of the new
docklands highway - 'from the City and on to your aircraft in 30 minutes. We
are compact, quick and friendly,' he claims.
Last year the airport handled 187,000 passengers and he hopes 1993 will see
up to 300,000 people passing through. The airport, however, is still
loss-making, a position which is unlikely to change until between 450,000
and 500,000 opt for London City. Capacity is two million a year.
Mr Charnock, who has a staff of 90 (around 450 people, in all, work around
the airport complex) is optimistic - 'the year has started very well, the
airlines appear increasingly confident and things are looking up.'
Construction group Mowlem has not, however, yet managed to find a partner to
share its load.
Someone who has been involved in the development of docklands a great deal
longer is PETER TURLIK, head of strategic affairs at the London Docklands
Development Corporation. A town-planner by profession, he was involved in
docklands before the LDDC was born, firstly via secondment to the Greater
London Council's docklands joint committee and then to the Department of the
Environment.
He joined the LDDC on its formation in 1981 as director of industrial
development, with responsibility for vesting in the corporation local land,
and for setting up the docklands enterprise zone - 'that first Christmas
there were 12 of us in the old Fred Olsen shipping building and we kept
getting lost every time we tried to get off the Isle of Dogs through the old
timber yards.'
Mr Turlik later became director of business development and by 1988 was
overseeing efforts to attract overseas investment. As head of strategic
affairs, he oversees the LDDC corporate plan, which is submitted annually to
the DoE.
He thinks the corporation has used the last two, difficult years well to
retrench and prepare for the next phase of expansion - 'I sometimes have to
pinch myself. Things have gone tremendously quickly. We had a lot of luck in
the 1980s and we've also had our bad breaks. But we don't give ourselves
enough credit for what has been achieved.'
Docklands is a new experience, however, for ROGER COLOMB, a managing
director of Texaco, the energy group, which moved into Canary Wharf only
weeks ago. As the man in charge of administration, he has been responsible
for relocating 1,000 staff, the last arrivals moving in to Westferry Circus
at the beginning of March.
Mr Colomb may be a new face and Texaco may be a new name locally but he is
keen to make his company an integral part of the local community as soon as
possible. He says Texaco has an opportunity to play an important role in the
life of Docklands, financially as well as socially, and intends to do so.
The company, with a 1,000-year lease on 230,000 sq ft of office space, has
already forged links with local organisations. Mr Colomb says there is 'a
real opportunity for us to put down some real roots.' But his own, daily
journey from Buckinghamshire takes him only ten minutes longer than to
Knightsbridge so he does not intend to move in to live.
ERIC SORENSEN might be forgiven for thinking he has been chief executive of
the LDDC for ten years, rather than just over two years. He arrived from the
Department of the Environment as docklands faced its biggest crisis and
readily admits that the going has been extremely tough - 'the recession, the
collapse of Canary Wharf, uncertainty over the Jubilee line and the DoE's
own decision not to relocate here gave the impression that the government
had become bored with the whole process. It was not the case, but that's how
it appeared.'
Mr Sorensen, 48, was at the DoE from 1967 until he arrived at the DoE and
has wide experience of urban regeneration. He was private secretary to Mr
Peter Shore when he was environment secretary and spent three years as head
of the Merseyside task force, developing local regeneration projects.
By 1987 he was head of the urban policy unit in the cabinet office and
became deputy secretary of the DoE's housing and construction command before
joining the LDDC. Last year was, he says, the low point but he is optimistic
that docklands will soon be back on course.
There is also a new spring in the step of MALCOLM HUTCHINSON, managing
director of the Docklands Light Railway. After a rough start which made it
something of a local laughing stock, the DLR is regaining its reputation as
a modern, fast passenger service linking docklands and the City.
With Brown Root, the US engineering contractors, appointed to manage the
system's expansion over the next three years, Mr Hutchinson says:'I am a
great fan of Docklands. I am confident it has a bright future and I am
determined, with the help of my staff, to play a full part in the area's
regeneration'.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Survey of London Docklands (8): Journey between polar
extremes - Dining in Docklands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HUGE parcel arrived in the post, full of leaflets, magazines and a thick
business directory about Docklands. All of them made more than a passing
reference to The London Docklands Guide - Good Food Awards.
So, I thought, this cannot be the wilderness painted by other guides such as
Michelin and the Good Food Guide. Apart from a little oasis around Butler's
Wharf, they had virtually nothing to recommend in Docklands.
Thus, with two such polar extremes fixed in mind, I set off to find discover
the latest facilities for dining in Docklands. And where better to begin
than at that rallying point to a new business empire: Canary Wharf. But this
turned out to be a rather fleeting visit. There's a pizzeria and - in Cabot
Place - a capucchino bar and an open-plan concession for snacks ('just
changed hands,' commented the security guard). I managed to find 'The Cat &amp;
Canary' - and a ship, The Lady Gwynfred - and that was my lot.
To raise morale, I felt that the Docklands Guide blue-riband award-winner,
Manzi's seafood restaurant at Turnberry Quay, might do the trick. After all,
the original in Leicester Street has been going strong since 1928.
This new rotunda-shaped building off Pepper Street looks fine from outside:
good views across the quay - and warm brickwork. Inside, it is less
convincing with the flourishes of modern Italian dining (sharp lighting,
murals) offset by ersatz bistro furniture and tableware, even fake gingham.
Sadly, the food is a marked return to the bad old days. Breton fish soup was
divvied up with provencale rouille; the colour and, come to think of it, the
taste of Germolene and it did little to boost a dreary liquid. Chicken
livers with bacon tasted satisfactory, but looked appalling - slung onto the
plate with shrivelled lettuce.
Fish - their speciality - proved hugely disappointing. Some salmon was
completely dried out; and a section of plain-grilled turbot, if more moist,
arrived with a large blob of Hollandaise that tasted like rancid
butter-icing. The sauce chef's night off? Let's hope so.
Image seems to be a prime consideration in Docklands. New roads that have
yet to acquire buildings already have lush rows of trees and shrubs.
Materials used in architecture - steel and glass - help to create an image
of optimism and a bright future.
Even the occasional dockside Georgian dwelling has had its brickwork cleaned
so that any glimpse of history now looks sharp and positive.
Commercial Road - the Limehouse section - at least has yet to receive such
attention. It looks ripe for demolition. But it is here that you'll find one
of the oldest gastronomic links with an earlier era.
'Old Friends' is the descendant of the original venue on West India Dock
Road, established just after the war to provide Cantonese food for visiting
Chinese sailors. With its tassled lanterns and flowery wallpaper, there's
none of today's Soho-chic about it.
The food is acceptable rather than exceptional; standard Cantonese dishes
without the balance or sharpness that you might find in London's Lisle
Street.
Three doors up is Tai-Pan - more modern, lighter and airier and offering
some spicier Szechuan dishes alongside more predictable items: soft shell
crab with peppercorn salt, Mongolian lamb wrapped in lettuce leaves and
wonderful chow nor lok, king prawns in their shells in a tomato sauce.
Heading east towards Silvertown, Beckton and London City Airport, I suddenly
realised what a conundrum Docklands has become as I stood near Gallions
Reach and looked back at the Isle of Dogs.
Here are still vast expanses of land and water virtually untouched with
almost village-like communities tucked away that seem a million miles
removed from the shimmering towers and wharves further west. Fine dining
doesn't exist, but occasionally you will find an established neighbourhood
restaurant doing well.
The Woolwich Tandoori in North Woolwich, next to a boarded-up pub and an
empty Chinese take-away, represents the East End rather than Docklands, and
is doing a rather more down-to-earth job than most of the eateries you will
come across.
Here, tandooris and biyranis are fine, served pleasantly in a gold and
mirrored cave.
This cosy air is in marked opposition to the colder, more brittle edge of
the newer hotels in the area. The Britannia International has both Jenny's
Carvery and Crompton's a la carte restaurant, neither of which manage to
either comfort or challenge. Anywhere still cooking dishes (let alone
describing them thus) such as Canard a l'Orange or Supreme de Volaille Kiev
deserves a suspicious gaze.
My theory was born out by a very pedestrian dish called 'Surf &amp; Turf' which
not even king prawns and tarragon butter sauce could revive.
Across the river in Rotherhithe, the Three Crowns Restaurant in the Scandic
Crown Hotel is barely an improvement. The centre piece is a smorgasbord for
both lunch and dinner. It is unremarkable save only for the fact that the
owners are Scandinavian - and you'd have thought they would know a thing or
two about such buffets. (I bet you don't get rough-cut smoked mackerel,
flavourless ordinary prawns and dreary wilting garnishes at the Oslo or
Helsinki branches).
Thankfully, there is hope on the horizon and his name is Sir Terence Conran.
Not content with Le Pont de Ia Tour and the Blueprint Cafe at the Design
Museum, there's a new, more informal eatery, the Cantina del Ponte. And, as
if that wasn't enough, a new chop-house in Butler's Wharf to be unveiled
later this year.
I have no desire to inflate Sir Terence's reputation at the expense of
anyone else's, but it should be said that this is one of the few places
where you are virtually assured of being served something more than half way
decent. And, the combined effect of this cluster of eateries seems to me to
be in the true spirit of what Docklands is all about. A model of cool,
well-designed business efficiency, reflecting the spirit of the age.
The new Cantina del Ponte majors well on fresh pizzas and calzone, simple
grills and fresh salads. A risotto of tomatoes and baby spinach was
heavenly; and a calzone with three cheeses, aubergine and basil had perfect
texture and taste.
Just when you think you've had your fill, there's also a collection of shops
to enable you to take the experience home with you in the shape of fine
olive oils, basil plants and fresh breads. Conran has proved that you can
take a site and bring in enough people to make it pay.
Others have not been so fortunate. With buildings filling (then emptying) on
the Isle of Dogs, restaurateurs have seen their business ebb and flow.
The Waterfront on South Quay Plaza has recently closed and is now doing bar
snacks, instead. And a ship, Le Passarelle, also moored on South Quay as a
restaurant, was towed away earlier this month.
Facilities for dining in Docklands, it would seem, are unlikely to stabilise
until there's a more firmly rooted population in place. Then, hopefully,
restaurant entries in the London Docklands Guide might overlap more often
with those in the Good Food Guide.

and new - Leisure Facilities

<TEXT>
I WAS on my way to the Surrey Docks Watersports Centre when I came across
the story of the whale oil which lit the lamps of London.
At the Watersports Centre, you can sail, canoe or windsurf if you are over
eight years old and are able to swim 50 metres in light clothes. The whale
oil story, less bracing but more intriguing, is on a Docklands Heritage
information panel near the water's edge at Greenland Dock.
It says: 'Two hundred years ago, you would have been unhappily aware of the
awful stench of rotting whale blubber. Each spring, small ships left here
for six-week dashes to the icy, storm-blown Arctic waters off Greenland.
Half-rotten whale blubber was brought back in casks and boiled in huge
coppers on this dockside to extract the oil. Much of it was used to light
the streets of London.'
Two hundred years later, the lights are no longer lit with oil and whale
hunting is frowned upon. The part of the dock on which the information panel
appears is now called Rainbow Quay after 'the Greenpeace ship Rainbow
Warrior which campaigned against whaling.'
In 200 years' time, visitors to Docklands may find the story of the
twentieth century anti-whaling movement as interesting as the oil lamps of
London. For the record, there are 11 watersports centres in London
Docklands, a 200-metre artificial ski slope, three urban farms and dozens of
pubs and restaurants, some of them very old. There is no leisure activity in
Docklands, however, which beats wandering around.
Docklands has acquired an awful reputation in some quarters. Some of it
comes from local activists who objected to the breakneck development of the
1980s. More of it comes from people who have never been there but have
persuaded themselves, all the same, that it has been a disaster.
Many critics, in this newspaper as much as any other, have excoriated the
architecture, the 'toy-town' Docklands Light Railway and much else. I cannot
understand why. It is true that some of the office building is uninspiring.
But some of the shopping areas in restored wharf buildings are excellent.
And much of the residential development, low-rise and brick, is a distinct
improvement on most of what was done all over London in the three preceding
decades.
Some of the outlying buildings at Canary Wharf - with their transplanted,
straight-out-of-the-box, North American look - do bear a startling
resemblance to the hotels at the Euro Disney theme park outside Paris.
But the queues are shorter at Docklands than at Euro Disney and
entertainment is available at a fraction of the price. The Docklands Light
Railway swoops and veers like a fairground ride. It is easier on the
stomach, however, than Disney's Big Thunder Mountain and you can get on and
off as you like.
If the threat of IRA bombing had not ended plans to allow visitors to ride
the lift to the top of the Canary Wharf tower, there would be no reason to
visit the Paris theme park at all. Unlike Euro Disney, Docklands' surprises
are uncontrived. They slip from the layers of the past that you unravel on
each visit, rather than from the minds of the Disney imagineers.
So far-reaching were London's trading links, that there is hardly a foreign
visitor who is not going to find some Docklands connection. There is, for
example, the Norway Cut Swing Bridge, Finland Quay East and West India Quay.
Did you know that the Mayflower, which took the Pilgrim Fathers to America
in 1620, departed from the riverside quarter of Rotherhithe? Or that its
captain, Christopher James, is buried in St Mary's churchyard, a short walk
from the river?
Rotherhithe is a quiet, clean, settled-looking place. The residents could
make much more of their American connection if they wanted to. Perhaps they
don't. The restored 16th century pub, which was once called the Spread
Eagle, is now called the Mayflower. But apart from a small plaque explaining
this, it doesn't shout about it.
The parish church of St Mary, Rotherhithe, has been a site of Christian
worship for nearly 1,000 years. The current church, splendid in the spring
sunshine, replaced one built in the twelfth century. It was completed in
1715 and was designed by John James, an associate of Sir Christopher Wren.
It beats Sleeping Beauty's Castle.
A little more care could certainly have been taken to ensure that transport
links were developed along with the offices and homes of the new Docklands,
rather than as an after-thought.
Some of the new transport facilities are already looking run-down. Island
Gardens station, through which many tourists pass on their way to the
Greenwich foot tunnel, was strewn with litter when I was there.
But all these moans to some extent miss the point. To travel through
Docklands is to realise that it has often been a place of chaos, of failed
dreams, of wild booms and busts, of perseverance against the odds.
German air raids in September 1940 destroyed all the timber in Surrey Docks
 -350,000 tons in one night.
The flames were visible 30 miles away. On 57 consecutive nights from
September to November 1940, 25,000 bombs rained down on Docklands, making
them the most heavily bombed civilian target in the country. But they stayed
open.
Once a gateway of world trade, Docklands' calm waters are now free for
windsurfing. On dry land, others had new aspirations for the area. No longer
the destination of the world's trading ships, some - such as Paul Reichmann,
Canary Wharf's failed developer - believed London's docklands could be the
electronic gateway to Europe, providing the offices from which business
would be done at the tap of a computer key.
Those new developers have added another layer to the Docklands story. Future
visitors might see the results as the high-water mark of a greedy time,
whose nemesis was both inevitable and richly-deserved. Or they might regard
the new buildings, homes and shops as a testament to a much-maligned decade,
in which, for all the accompanying chicanery and rough manners, a somnolent
nation awoke, however briefly, to the promise of the future. Both
interpretations assume the failure of Docklands in its newest guise. But
that failure is not inevitable; Docklands in its high-tech, electronic form,
might rise again. What, after all, is a four or five-year property slump in
a city as old as London?
In the Docklands Visitor Centre, a history of the area tells us that
London's prosperity died out after 410 AD But the city boomed again, even if
did take 300 years.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Survey of London Docklands (4): New mood of realism as
market stirs again - Housing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE story of the rise and fall of docklands is neatly encapsulated in the
experiences of its housing market.
In the late 1980s, the vision of glitzy, futuristic apartments, their yuppy
inhabitants swilling chilled wine behind unwelcoming, electronic gates
appeared to say it all - despite the fact that nearly two-thirds of all
house sales went to local residents on more modest means.
Docklands was perceived as the front-edge of a brave new world, built on a
booming financial services market in which the smart but inexperienced could
make big bucks and buy a swanky home just a few minutes drive from the
office in the Porsche Carrerra.
But the bubble burst and with it went the over-confident, over-mortgaged
newcomers who had been ready to pay up to Pounds 600,000 for a new lifestyle
and a private mooring. The values of homes built for trading, rather than
for living in, collapsed and the story turned sour.
It was not a story exclusive to Docklands but, somehow, the calamity seemed
all the worse, given the promise which had been held out by its creators and
promoters.
A recent report from Ancer, the property consultants, showed just how bad
things became. Last year, it says, only 230 new residential properties were
sold in Docklands - well under a third of the total sold in 1990 and the
lowest number recorded in more than a decade.
At the worst point, the London Docklands Development Corporation calculated
that around 1,500 completed homes were looking for buyers, approaching 15
per cent of the the total number completed since the LDDC arrived.
Prices, on average, have fallen by between 30 and 35 per cent across the
board, not only an indication of collapsing demand but of the absurd,
temporary overheating which hit the market in the latter stages of the
1980s' boom.
A new mood of realism means that apartments like those at Clippers Quay,
originally valued to be sold at Pounds 195,000, are being sold now for
Pounds 120,000.
Now, after a prolonged period in which owners and developers have licked
their wounds, there are some signs that the worst is over and that the local
housing market is again stirring.
Caution, however, is now the overriding theme. Mr Mike Bignell, the LDDC's
head of property marketing, says there was a surge in interest among buyers
at the very start of the year but it tailed off in March - 'it's been up and
down. We are still waiting to see if there has been any significant
improvement again,' he says.
There is also some evidence that, once again, interest is beginning to rise
among foreign investors, who played a role in the market during the late
1980s.
At the same time, it appears that sales of residential property for
investment purposes are accounting for a growing proportion of those
transactions which are taking place.
Investors can expect a gross rental return of up 12 per cent on their
property, against a realistic return on more central London properties of up
to 9 per cent, according to one local agent.
Some of the property experts are already proclaiming the Docklands revival
is underway. Ancer reports a 'sudden surge' in sales, with clear signs of
renewed strength after four years of weakness. But however optimistic the
noises, there is little doubt that any increase in activity will take a
considerable time to work through in terms of rising prices.
After the knocks of the late 1980s and early '90s, the LDDC is gearing up
for renewed activity in its role as vendor of development land. Over the
next year it plans the phased release of 13 development sites, a significant
increase on the previous twelve months.
The return of private developers is seen as essential, given the
ever-present dangers of housing estate 'ghettos' if development is left only
to the public sector. A mixed community of housing remains the driving
philosophy for the area.
The LDDC is negotiating land deals in several locations, including a key
site at Beckton. It is also releasing a development site in the same area by
organising a competition among builders.
Price alone will not be enough to win. A developer will be selected on the
basis of the proposals submitted, with attention paid to the type of housing
and the time-scale envisaged among other factors - 'we are not yet ready to
consider tendering sites,' says Mr Bignell.
Builders are certainly renewing their interest in the area, albeit
cautiously. Having sold nearly all the properties on its Hithe Point
development, Barratt London has started work on Sovereign View, a former
wharf on Surrey Docks, which will provide 275 homes and apartments. Prices
will start as low as Pounds 65,000.
Fairview New Homes is also building in Docklands for the first time,
developing 113 low-cost starter homes on a 2.4-acre waterside site at Timber
Wharves, Isle of Dogs.
Prices on the development, which has yielded the first land deal of such a
size for four years, will start as low as Pounds 39,000.
There are also some housing association schemes under way, a sector of the
market which for a time has represented the only meaningful development in
the area.
The LDDC is now, above all, looking for a period of equilibrium in local
housing. It wants to place the emphasis, initially, on low-cost housing and
will then release what it describes as higher quality locations as market
conditions permit.
It is particularly excited about the prospects for developing an urban
village to the south of Royal Victoria dock.
The LDDC envisages 300 housing units being built over the next two and half
years and - in a rolling programme - wants to see 7,000 homes and a complete
community in place within seven years. The infrastructure is already in
place.
Such schemes point to the way ahead. There are few who believe that the
return of super-luxury property developments is, once again, just around the
corner.
A great many fingers have been burned in the last three or four years and
Docklands realises that it will not be in its own interests if the local
housing market is exposed to another damaging debacle. According to Mr
Bignell, 'this time round, it is all going to be much more down-to-earth.'

FT  21 MAY 93 / Survey of London Docklands (5): A return to favour -
Industrial Sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR most of the 1980s, the industrial sector's role in regenerating London
Docklands was eclipsed by the rapid growth of the office sector. But in the
wake of the slump in the Docklands' office market, the sector's potential is
being re-examined.
The London Docklands Development Corporation has commissioned Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley, chartered surveyors, to consider the prospects of attracting light
industry to the area. Although the findings have not yet been published,
they are likely to show that there is scope for putting more emphasis on
industry property.
'The fact that the LDDC is now seriously considering industrial development
in the Docklands is logical and sensible in view of the infrastructure and
spending already accorded to the area and given the state of the office
property market,' says Mr Stephen Mallen, head of property research at
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley.
A greater emphasis on industrial development would build on an established
base. The docks traditionally had numerous industries related to the import
and export of goods, even though it was rarely associated with heavy
manufacturing. North Woolwich and Silvertown are still important areas for
manufacturing and service industries. For instance, long-established
companies include Pura Foods, refiners and bottlers of edible oil, in
Leamouth and Tate &amp; Lyle, sugar refiners and Charringtons, the brewers in
Silvertown. That said, the past two decades saw a rapid decline in
industrial activity. The closure of the Docks left many riverside industries
with no long term prospect of survival.
Some critics of the LDDC think that it did not do enough to tackle the
continued decline of the area's traditional industrial and manufacturing
base - 'the LDDC has consistently encouraged and even accelerated this
decline. Rather than use its power and resources to assist local industries,
the Corporation tends to see them as a barrier to regeneration,' said the
Docklands Consultative Committee, a group set up by the area's local
authorities.
The LDDC did not accept this criticism. It pointed to the support it gave
businesses through serviced industrial sites at Cody Road, north of Canning
Town, Crescent Street in E16 and the Poplar Business Park, together with the
London Industrial Park that Newnham set up in Beckton. Various government
grants such as City Grant are also available.
The LDDC has earmarked 42 acres of land for light industry. The proposed
sites are four acres at Quebec Way in Surrey Docks, seven acres at Cody
Road, north of Leamouth, 11 acres on the south side of King George V Dock
and 20 acres on the south side of Albert Basin.
SOME critics suggest that these sites may have problems attracting
occupiers. Access may be too difficult and the high building and landscaping
requirements too onerous to suit some potential users.
However, a change in policy which allowed industrial or distribution
companies to use better sites might ultimately be considered a wasted
opportunity. Having invested heavily in upgrading the area - some Pounds
500m has been spent on infrastructure in the Royal Docks - it holds out the
hope of attracting prestigious occupiers, such as a business park or
corporate headquarters.
A decision to encourage industrial development would, in some respects, be a
break with the past. The architects of the dockland's regeneration had an
ambivalent attitude to manufacturing industry. They did not want to 'condemn
Docklands to its past,' as Mr Reg Ward, its first chief executive put it.
The efforts made by local authorities in the 1970s to bring back
manufacturing industry were considered to be futile. Moreover, the
Docklands, they believed, had the potential to be more than a routine
industrial development area.
The LDDC got the chance to prove this in 1982, when the Government set up an
Enterprise Zone covering 460 acres on the Isle of Dogs and Lea Estuary. This
gave a ten-year exemption from rates and allowed 100 per cent tax write-offs
against the capital costs of non-residential buildings.
Although the government had expected the Enterprise Zone to encourage
industrial expansion, the LDDC believed it could also be used by office
users, who would be attracted by the ability to write-off their investment
against tax.
'We used the EZ in an entirely different and somewhat 'maverick' way . . .
to make the Isle of Dogs an office and commercial location rather than
confirming it as an industrial one,' said Mr Ward.
Builders put up flexible 'business space,' which could be used for
activities ranging from warehousing, production, research and development
and offices. Although these were mostly successful, the emphasis
increasingly switched to office developments in the 1980s as the service
sector expanded and land values rose.
Nonetheless, the area had successes in bringing in high-tech industry,
particularly in the case of the telecommunications industry. For instance, a
teleport was opened at North Woolwich to handle satellite communications for
financial business services.
National newspapers were also important investors. The printworks of the
Daily Mail, Guardian, Daily Telegraph and the FT moved in to Surrey Quays,
Millharbour, Isle of Dogs and Leamouth. They were attracted to Docklands by
its enterprise zone status, its good communications, large sites and easy
accessibility to Central London.
The tax breaks have now expired, although the other attractions remain. The
effort to attract new users to the area is likely to focus on the limited
number of manufacturing activities that benefit from proximity to central
London.
Potential occupiers may include perishable food processors serving the
Central London market or businesses associated with telecoms, data storage
and transmission and computer centres. There may also be demand from
warehouses for distributors serving the London market, although planners
might be reluctant to give permission to buildings with relatively low
aesthetic appeal or employment potential.
The difficulties of attracting industry to the inner cities means that more
industrial development cannot play more than a partial role in the
regeneration of the docklands. But the area's greatly improved
infrastructure and its over-supply of offices makes a good case for putting
a greater emphasis on industrial development.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Survey of London Docklands (3): Dockland defenders remain
hopeful - Office Property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR after Canary Wharf's insolvency sent shockwaves through the Docklands
office market, opinion remains sharply divided about the sector's prospects
for recovery.
The sceptics doubt whether the area has a chance of ever living up to the
ambitious plans that were hatched in the second half of the 1980s. They
believe that the high-profile problems of Canary Wharf and other schemes
have dealt a lasting blow to the Dockland's prestige. Moreover, the
oversupply in the City and weak demand from the financial services sector
will severely constrain take-up of offices. At the current rate of take-up,
there is well over a decade's supply of available office space.
But its defenders believe that within the next five years, its fortunes
could be transformed. They think it can still fulfil its potential of being
London's third business centre, along with the City and West End.
The area's champions draw encouragement from improvements to the Docklands
transport system and the arrival of large tenants such as Texaco at Canary
Wharf.
Moreover, they contend that Canary Wharf's move into administration was less
damaging to tenant demand than was generally assumed, notwithstanding the
decision of some of the Wharf's tenants, such as American Express, to
abandon their move.
Interest in the Docklands from potential tenants actually increased after
the insolvency of Canary Wharf, according to Mr Roger Parsons of Knight
Frank &amp; Rutley, chartered surveyors - 'we had a lot of people come and have
a look purely out of curiosity. It raised expectations that there were
incredible deals because everyone assumed the Docklands was on its knees.'
Indeed, demand for office space in the Docklands showed slight signs of
improvement last year. Take-up increased to 332,000 sq ft in 1992, compared
to 192,500 sq ft in 1991, according to Knight Frank &amp; Rutley.
The trend also improved in the first quarter of 1993, which saw the highest
quarterly take-up rate of 213,503 sq ft, since the second quarter of 1990.
However, it is unclear how sustainable this improvement will be. Some 90 per
cent of the first quarter's take-up was the result of moves by three
occupiers from in or immediately around the Docklands. The largest deal was
struck by the London Borough of Tower Hamlets which in February announced
that it would move its town hall to a 140,000 sq ft building in the East
India Dock development owned by NCC, the Swedish development group and SPP,
the Swedish insurance group. In addition, Northern and Shell, the
publishers, bought the 54,000 sq ft Merchant House in City Harbour and East
London Telecommunications let 27,000 sq ft at Limeharbour Court.
Another notable deal in the first quarter of 1993 was the LDDC's sale of
three acres in March to the Lord Chancellor's Department, which announced
plans to build a 150,000 sq ft courtroom complex in East India Dock. Other
office tenants that have taken space in the past year include Endsleigh
Insurance, which rented 24,000 sq ft in South Quay Plaza II in 1992, the
Dept. of Transport, Sunrise TV and the National Therapeutic and Osteopathic
Society.
THE Western International University of Phoenix, Arizona agreed last summer
to open a London campus that would occupy 20,000 sq ft of Glengall Bridge, a
scheme by London and Edinburgh Trust and BICC Development at Millharbour.
Another educational establishment, the European Language School, also took
space in the scheme.
The attraction of the Docklands for most incoming tenants is price.
Typically, a new tenant would pay Pounds 10 per sq ft for a ten year lease,
with 2 1/2 years rent free. Furthermore, the Uniform Business Rate of around
Pounds 10-15 per sq ft for top specification space is cheaper than in the
City and West End rates where it averages some Pounds 23 per sq ft. However,
the 1995 revaluation, which is based on rental values in April 1993, will
reduce this differential.
Although there has been a trickle of small and medium-sized deals in the
past year, the Docklands will need to attract large office users before it
has a realistic chance of recovery. Some 57 per cent of available space of
available space in the Isle of Dogs (which totals 2.87m sq ft) is in
buildings over 200,000 sq ft.
Unsurprisingly, Canary Wharf dominates the market. It accounts for half the
available space in the Isle of Dogs, which in turn accounts for 84 per cent
of the LDDC area.
Its prospects remain highly uncertain. Since the project moved into
administration, it has attracted little interest from tenants. Even with an
economic recovery and a resolution of the uncertainty surrounding the
Jubilee Line extension, the prospects of filling up the 4.5m sq ft project
are daunting.
Recovery in the Docklands property market is likely to lag the rest of the
London office market. Agents blame the meagre level of interest from
potential tenants on the intense price competition from other parts of
London.
'The problem is that there hasn't been a good reason to come to the
Docklands. The competition has been so strong,' says one agent.
The best hope of Docklands property owners is that once the large new office
blocks in the City of London have been taken up, large occupiers will decide
to move down the river to the docklands, rather than opt for second hand
accommodation that lacks air-conditioning. Another faint source of comfort
for Docklands' landlords is that the development pipeline has virtually
dried up. Moreover, there is little likelihood that the large development
projects that have already won planning permission will come to fruition.
With its modern office space and improving infrastructure, the Docklands
should benefit from a pick-up in tenant demand as the economy recovers. But
even the most optimism observer of the Docklands believes that pulling its
property market out of its current position will be a long, slow haul.
A Small Business Ideas Day, sponsored by John Laing, the construction group,
will be held on Wednesday, June 9 at the Skylines development. Details of
the open day and exhibition are available on 071 497 9707.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Survey of London Docklands (2): Envy of the capital -
Transport Investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOCKLANDS is caught in a trap when it comes to transport. On the one hand,
it wants to secure investment in more and better links by stressing to
government the inadequacy of the existing infrastructure. On the other, it
seeks to lure investors by telling them how good its transport is now.
Amid the resulting confusion, the overriding impression is that the first of
these two versions is correct: that the government has let docklands down by
failing to provide better transport. Indeed, the developers of Canary Wharf
have directly attributed that project's financial failure to the inadequacy
of the links between central London and the Isle of Dogs. But are these
criticisms founded on reality, or myth?
To answer the question, it is necessary to go back to the beginning of the
docklands story. It is sometimes forgotten just how modest the government's
ambitions for docklands were when it set up the London Docklands Development
Corporation to regenerate the area in 1981. Then, all it foresaw was the
construction of 8.5m sq ft of light industrial premises. Clearly, east
London's transport needs had to be looked at afresh, but at that time it
seemed enough to improve the roads and install the 'toy town' Docklands
Light Railway on a shoestring budget of Pounds 77m.
That might have been the end of the story had it not been for the Reichmann
brothers. But when they and their private property company, Olympia &amp; York,
arrived in 1987 with their grandiose scheme to turn the the Isle of Dogs
into London's third business centre (the other two being the West End and
the City), the transport plans were thrown into chaos.
Considering the scale of the demands being made on it, the government
reacted with astonishing speed and generosity. Within months, it was
carrying out detailed work on the options for improving docklands' transport
infrastructure. The East London Rail Study was completed and published in
January 1989, and in November that same year a Bill to authorise
construction of the Jubilee Line extension went before parliament. More than
Pounds 3.5bn was committed to roads, the Underground line and the upgrading
of the Docklands Light Railway.
It is true that not all this transport investment went smoothly - but then,
transport investment rarely does. Services on the Docklands Light Railway,
for example, were continually disrupted by the upgrading programme.
Under pressure from Olympia &amp; York to do something about the railway's poor
performance, the government eventually stripped control of the line from
London Transport and installed a new management team headed by Sir Peter
Levene, the former procurement chief at the Ministry of Defence.
Worse, the Jubilee Line was never built. But that was not the government's
fault. Since it was the Canary Wharf development that had given rise to the
need for the line, and since Canary Wharf would be the main beneficiary of
it, the government had secured an undertaking from Olympia &amp; York that the
company would make an up-front contribution of Pounds 100m towards the
line's Pounds 1.8bn construction cost.
When Olympia &amp; York collapsed, the company defaulted on its agreement, and
construction of the line has been postponed ever since. In other respects,
however, docklands is now looking well-served by transport. The main
features of the infrastructure include:
Roads: the Pounds 1.65bn roads and river crossings programme is virtually
complete, with many roads opening ahead of schedule.
The single most important road, the underground Limehouse Link, opened six
months ahead of schedule this month greatly improving communications between
docklands and the City. Barely a mile long and costing Pounds 255m to build,
it is reputed to be pro rata one of the most expensive pieces of road in the
world.
Docklands Light Railway: Initially built for Pounds 77m, the Docklands Light
Railway is now approaching the end of an Pounds 800m programme of
improvement and expansion. It has already been extended to Bank in the City;
an eastwards extension to Beckton opens in October; and a southward
extension across the river to Lewisham is planned.
The line is now performing reliably, with capacity greatly increased.
Jubilee Line Extension: the government has pledged that construction of the
Jubilee Line extension from central London to docklands will begin as soon
as the private sector produces its promised Pounds 100m contribution.
Last month the European Investment Bank said it was prepared to plug the gap
by lending Pounds 100m to whoever took over Canary Wharf from the
administrators, but the decision is likely to take some time to translate
into action.
London City Airport: a Pounds 5m runway extension made it possible to
introduce jet services at the privately-owned London City Airport in
docklands last year, leading to an expansion of services.
The airport will also get a boost from the opening of the Limehouse Link,
which it claims will put it within a 15-minute taxi ride of Tower Bridge in
the City.
RiverBus: a fleet of RiverBuses provides a novel form of urban transport
along the Thames between docklands and central London, operating at
15-minute during peak hours.
So where does that leave transport in docklands today?
Whatever else it may be, it is the envy of the rest of the capital - and
indeed, the rest of the country - which has been starved of transport
investment to pay for the Pounds 3.5bn being lavished in east London.
With Canary Wharf in administration and the rest of docklands blighted by
the surpluses overhanging the property market, it could reasonably be argued
that the real question is no longer whether the amount being spent on
transport in the area is too little, but whether it is too much.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Survey of London Docklands (1): May the best dream win -
After serious setbacks for London Docklands - a Pounds 10bn, world-class
experiment in urban regeneration - recent events seem to indicate that the
worst may now be over
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LONDON DOCKLANDS has always needed its visionaries and dreamers. The last
three years, however, have been more likely to generate nightmares.
The 5,000-acre riverside sprawl to the east of the British capital, a
world-class experiment in urban regeneration and a marble-clad totem to the
forces of free enterprise, was born at the dawn of Britain's entrepreneurial
renaissance.
The economic boom years of the 1980s gave it a flying start as it set about
showing the sceptics and the small-minded how government and business could
unite behind a Pounds 10bn budget to transform dereliction and decay into a
21st century, wealth-creating community.
But as the debate intensified over the logic of a strategy which built
skyscrapers first and roads second, so the swift transition from economic
boom to recession piled problem upon problem down in the docks.
The story of how golden promise turned to dark despair has been well
catalogued. An upstart rival to the centuries-old City on its doorstep,
dockland's ability to usurp the traditional role of the Square Mile was
always in question. The collapse of the UK economy - and in financial
services and the south-east, in particular, seemed to provide the answer.
Land which had doubled in value between 1986 and 1987 was now unsaleable,
along with the apartments which had boasted jacuzzis and six noughts on the
end of their asking prices. Companies which had been on the brink of moving
in, pulled back; new development ground to a halt as the inventory of empty
space rocketed,
The crisis of confidence seemed to spread to those with responsibility for
docklands, both within the London Docklands Development Corporation and in
Whitehall. The Department of the Environment, having raised expectations,
decided against moving its own staff to the area.
The spectacular collapse of Canary Wharf, the most grandiose property scheme
from the world's most ambitious property developer, also threw into doubt
the future of the crucial, Pounds 1.8bn Jubilee line underground extension.
The government expressed regret - from the sidelines.
'Last September was the low point,' recalls Mr Eric Sorensen, LDDC chief
executive. 'There seemed to be very little more that could be added to our
problems.
Beyond Docklands, the public impression was that the entire project had shut
down, that the area was set to revert to a wilderness. Yet the doom and
gloom about what was always going to be a long-term project, with its fair
share of ups and downs, may always have been a bit overdone.
In Dockland's darkest hour, more than 61,000 people were living there, a
similar number were employed there and 2,500 businesses were operating
there. The economic fault lines could not detract, either, from the sheer
physical achievements of some of the most enterprising developers and
designers.
But the statistics were of little comfort in the immediate crisis. Mr
Sorensen says, however, there was 'no point in whistling the wind.'
The best contribution was to press on with efforts to ensure that the
all-important transport links were developed - 'it was not just about
physical construction; it was psychologically important for the whole area
that we should make progress,' he adds.
THE LDDC has worked hard in helping to get the Jubilee line extension back
on track and, following agreement by the European Investment Bank to inject
Pounds 98m into the project, believes an important corner has been turned. A
final go-ahead, however, is still awaited.
Other, recent events have conspired to offer some hope that the worst really
might be over. Canary Wharf could soon be out of the hands of
administrators, while the ill-fated docklands light railway is improving its
unreliable image and expanding its network.
The opening this month of the controversial docklands highway, a dual
carriageway running from the city to the London City Airport, will transform
access, although there are fears of serious congestion around Tower Hill.
The airport itself is set for a significant expansion of its continental
services, though the complex remains a loss-making enterprise and operators,
Mowlem, have failed to find a partner to help them bear the cost. Its claim
of being a 15-minute taxi ride from the city should now, at least, be met.
There are also hopes that the end of recession will more generally stimulate
economic activity and allow Docklands to put its worst period behind it.
Caution prevails but there are some straws in the wind.
Local housing agents say that there has been an improvement in interest
among potential buyers and the commercial property market - sagging under
the weight of unwanted floorspace - is being encouraged by the arrival of
some significant occupiers.
Texaco, the US-owned energy group has just moved 1,000 headquarters staff
from London's west end into Canary Wharf while Credit Suisse First Boston
has brought in another 1,500. Canary Wharf, the giant 'white elephant,' now
has 6,500 people working in it. Other arrivals include Peat Marwick, Morgan
Stanley and Tower Hamlets council, with its 800 staff. Mirror Group
Newspapers is also said to be considering a move into Docklands.
The LDDC itself says it is no longer keeping its head down on the
development front. As the authority vested with ownership of 550 acres of
local land, it is again marketing some of its sites in a new air of
optimism. It intends to release 25 small building sites this year and is
brushing off previously aborted plans for an exhibition centre close to the
Royal Docks. The corporation is also keen to pursue ambitious plans for an
urban village on a 70-acre site in the same locality. It could ultimately be
home for up to 5,000 people.
Housing developers are also back in business, with Barrett London and
Fairview New Homes developing nearly 400 new homes between them. The
emphasis, in contrast to the 1980s, is going to be on lower-cost housing,
with prices on one of the developments starting at only Pounds 39,000.
Foreign investment interest is also perking up, with the Bank of China
recently completing the purchase of a block of 48 apartments on the Isle of
Dogs. New efforts to attract inward investors from overseas are being made
by the LDDC.
The position of Docklands as a vital, commercial bridgehead to the east of
London was recently endorsed by the government when it announced plans for a
'golden corridor' of development running along both sides of the Thames as
far as Tilbury and Sheerness.
The proposals were immediately welcomed by the LDDC as evidence of the
government's commitment to building up the economy to the east of the
capital. Mr Michael Howard, the Environment Secretary, slapped down 'critics
and doom mongers' to suggest that Docklands will resume its growth once the
economy gets under steam.
He was announcing the creation of a task force to spearhead long-term
economic development along the so-called East Thames Corridor. The intention
is to have a planning framework in place by March 1994.
Already, however, there are critics of the proposals, who point out that
such a strategy could suck development away from the west of London. They
also stress that much of the relevant land to the east of the capital has
been ravaged by years of industrial misuse.
Though Mr Howard spoke of docklands as a 'great success story,' his plans
for further expansion to the east clearly revealed that lessons have been
learned in high places.
A key to the plans will be in ensuring that the development of the corridor
co-incides with an extensive infrastructure programme. A more flexible
strategy will also mean less concentration on office developments and the
provision of a broader range of integrated projects.
The minister envisaged 100,000 new homes and 100,000 extra jobs in a decade.
Virtually the same targets are shared by Docklands itself. May the best
dream win.

FT  21 MAY 93 / The Property Market: The end of the Georgian reign - The
exodus of companies from Edinburgh's traditional business district
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Charlotte Square in Edinburgh, as the firms which operate there like to
boast, is the best business address in Europe. Yet many of its occupants are
deserting it.
In the past 18 months the whole of the south side of the square has become
vacant, there are empty buildings on both the east and west sides, and a
building on the north side is for sale. As the 'for let' signs proliferate,
some people fear that parts of the square, designed by Robert Adam, may soon
look tatty.
In one sense Charlotte Square is only the most spectacular victim of the
downturn in the Edinburgh office property market which has left vacant about
200 Georgian houses used as offices throughout the city's New Town. In a
normal market about 40 would be vacant, says Mr Andy Irvine of Jones Lang
Wootton, the surveyors.
But Charlotte Square's plight is also the product of another trend which
many people involved in the city's development regard positively: the
expansion of the business district from the New Town out to Lothian Road to
the south.
Edinburgh's prime office district has traditionally comprised the dumbbell
formed by Charlotte Square to the west and St Andrew Square to the east,
connected by George Street. Most firms in the New Town occupy Georgian
houses.
In Charlotte Square the solicitors Dundas &amp; Wilson until recently occupied
five houses. The tightly enforced rules for grade A listed buildings meant
that to install computer wiring meant getting planning permission to drill
holes in thick walls. But the area was prestigious and there was virtually
nowhere nearby with good open-plan accommodation.
The constraints on development in the New Town, the slow process of getting
planning permission and the lack of office space elsewhere meant that when
businesses expanded in the late-1980s rents for the best office
accommodation trebled from Pounds 7 per square foot in 1985 to Pounds 21 in
1989.
It was not until late 1991 that alternative accommodation attractive to
Charlotte Square occupants became available, when Saltire Court, a high
quality stone-faced office building in Castle Terrace off Lothian Road was
completed.
Saltire Court went ahead after Edinburgh district council reversed years of
opposition to fostering the financial sector, and released the site. The
first occupants were Martin Currie and KPMG Peat Marwick from Charlotte
Square, followed by Dundas &amp; Wilson.
But Scottish Metropolitan, the developer, was unlucky: by the time Saltire
Court was finished the approaching recession made companies wary of moving,
especially if they were unable to find tenants to take on their existing
properties. (Some tenants of Saltire Court are still paying rent on their
former properties, in addition to the headline rent of Pounds 22-Pounds 23
per sq ft in the new building).
Only now, after solicitors Shepherd &amp; Wedderburn decided in March to move
from Charlotte Square, is 92 per cent of Saltire Court's 175,000 sq ft of
office space let.
But people working in Saltire Court and other developments near Lothian Road
will still feel slightly out on a limb until a long-standing 10-acre site
between the Caledonian Hotel and the Sheraton fills up. Progress there is at
last being made, sufficient to allow Mr Jim McFarlane of Lothian and
Edinburgh Enterprise (Leel), the local enterprise company, to claim that
Edinburgh is 'bucking the recession'.
Work began in January on a Pounds 38m conference centre, designed by the
post-modernist architect Terry Farrell and capable of holding 1,200 people,
on a site on Morrison Street. The conference centre has long been considered
the cornerstone to the development of the Lothian Road site.
The council and Leel set up a company to build and run the conference centre
and to develop the rest of the site, after the original consortium of
Sheraton Securities and Greycoat, which was to have developed the centre,
collapsed.
That gave Standard Life, the Edinburgh-based life assurance company, the
confidence to choose Lothian Road to accommodate its expansion. It should
shortly get consent for a 270,000 sq ft office complex on a site which it
will buy from the council and from Queens Moat, owner of the Caledonian
Hotel.
Further south Scottish Widows is seeking planning permission for a new
800,000 sq ft headquarters on the 6.5-acre Port Hamilton site, which it
would buy from the receivers of Ford Sellar Morris, another victim of the
property collapse.
Meanwhile a joint venture between Cala and Morrison Group, both Scottish
companies, says it will proceed with a 190,000 sq ft office building close
to the conference centre. The consortium is confident of obtaining a pre-let
before going ahead.
If all these schemes go ahead the central business district will have been
extended southwards and the Lothian Road area will have become Edinburgh's
main area for large city centre offices. But though Saltire Court has shown
that Edinburgh firms can be tempted out of their Georgian splendour, some
people doubt whether occupiers requiring up to 30,000 sq ft of space will
rush to abandon the New Town.
Mr Peter Smolka of Hillier Parker points out that several offices with
open-plan space are finished or under construction behind Georgian facades
in the New Town.
'I'd say there are enough developments under construction to retain a lot of
prospective tenants in the traditional core. Suddenly Edinburgh has become a
city that offers a choice of accommodation,' he says. Rents have come back
to Pounds 16.
So where does this leave Charlotte Square? Mr Smolka believes the council
will have to allow more alterations behind the facades if the exodus is to
be halted. Significantly, Mr David Murray, a Scottish tycoon, recently
obtained consent to redevelop the Roxburghe Hotel on the corner of the
square, mainly as offices.
Mr Roy Durie of chartered surveyors Ryden says there are a number of smaller
occupiers - 'public relations companies, advertising agencies and
professional firms' - which would dearly like a Charlotte Square address.
Jones Lang Wootton's Mr Irvine says: 'I am not at all gloomy about Charlotte
Square.' Despite the attractions of open-plan offices, Georgian houses 'work
very well for businesses with up to 25 people.'
But though sentiment in the market has begun improving, Mr Irvine says many
businesses which would like to move are locked into long leases.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour MPs split in Maastricht vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, was congratulated by cabinet colleagues
in the Commons last night after the Maastricht bill secured its third
reading in spite of a revolt by 41 Tory backbenchers.
The bill now goes to the House of Lords.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, saw his party split three ways - with the
majority following the official party line by abstaining.
Former cabinet ministers Mr Tony Benn and Mr Peter Shore were among the 65
Labour backbenchers who went into the lobby against the bill while four
Labour MPs voted for it.
Mr Kenneth Baker, the former Conservative party chairman and home secretary,
was among five government backbenchers who abstained.
Closing the debate, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, underlined the prime
minister's recent declaration that sterling would not rejoin the European
exchange rate mechanism for several years.
Stressing that it would be two or three years until the German economy
adjusted fully to the massive strains of reunification, the chancellor said:
'Until it does, it would not be appropriate for us to contemplate rejoining
the exchange rate mechanism'.
To government cheers, he insisted: 'It would not be in our economic
interests - and the government will not do it.'
Opening the debate Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, sought to win
over Tory doubters with a further assurance that Maastricht was not a
blueprint for a European superstate.
The foreign secretary used the 205th hour MPs have spent debating the
measure in the past year to warn passionately of the dangers of eroding
European competitiveness and to set out his vision of the Community's
future.
In a confident and relaxed address he assured Euro-sceptics that their fears
of a 'lurch' towards a superstate were 'misguided.' He concluded with a
clarion call to MPs before the bill moves to the Lords to 'find again' the
decisive will to act together in the 'great matters' where there was a
common European interest.
On the eve of the first anniversary of the bill's second reading Mr Hurd
devoted much of his speech to concerns that the costs imposed on employers
by the social chapter could have serious consequences for European
competitiveness.
'More and more people' were concerned about the high labour costs European
companies were faced with compared with their international competitors.
The social chapter could 'place in jeopardy many of the achievements of the
last 14 years in freeing our labour market from restrictions which destroy
jobs'.
His views were rejected by Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, who
said the government's decision to exclude the social chapter was
'fundamentally unacceptable.'
Referring to the manoeuvring that had forced the government to remove the
protocol containing Britain's social chapter opt-out, he said Labour had
secured a 'valuable legal situation' that may yet allow British workers to
use the European Court to gain access to the benefits of the chapter.
Mr Cunningham said Labour could not support the bill because of the
government's decision to exclude the social chapter. But since the party's
efforts had procured for MPs an opportunity to vote on the chapter's
principle, it would be 'obtuse' for Labour to vote against it.
To do so would deny the social chapter to workers in Europe as well as
Britain.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rifkind pressed on Swan Hunter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Political Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL FIVE Tyne and Wear local authorities yesterday asked Mr Malcolm Rifkind,
the defence secretary, for an assurance that the Swan Hunter shipyard would
be allowed to complete work on three frigates.
The leaders of the councils said they would not enter into talks about the
government's proposed enterprise zone if the shipyard closed with the loss
of 2,200 jobs.
The yard's receivers are to meet union officials today and are expected to
put forward a plan for redundancies.
The councils said Swan Hunter was 'at the heart of the north's economy and
its loss would be simply devastating to the whole of the north-east'.
Completion work on the Type-23 frigates Westminster, Northumberland and
Richmond would keep Swan Hunter going into next year and ensure continuing
employment for a significant part of the workforce. It would also provide
more time to find a new owner for the yard.
The only definite result so far from talks between the receivers and the
Ministry of Defence is that the yard can continue working at least up to the
end of next week.
Unions are poised to take a tough stance if the yard is forced to close
after this and if attempts are made to complete the frigates elsewhere.
Union conveners from shipyards throughout the country are to meet in
Carlisle tomorrow to discuss a call for Swan Hunter workers to resist
efforts to move the frigates and for workers at other yards to refuse to
complete them.
Mr Stephen Byers, the Labour MP whose Wallsend constituency takes in the
shipyard, said he had been told Swan Hunter creditors and local banks had
already lined up receivers to move into companies owed money.
He said the 'fall-out' from the Swan Hunter crisis would be devastating for
the whole north-east England economy.
'Within the next two weeks we shall witness the spectacle of further
companies going under in the wake of the collapse of Swan Hunter.'

FT  21 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour backs SIB on bank regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESPONSIBILITY FOR bank regulation should be taken away from the Bank of
England and could eventually be given to the Securities and Investments
Board, Labour said yesterday.
Mr Alistair Darling, the party's spokesman on City affairs, said the SIB
should have overall responsibility for financial services regulation and
should be given powers of enforcement.
'In time it might be appropriate to fuse the banking supervisory body with
the SIB,' he said.
But he maintained he was not advocating the 'importation' of a US-style
Securities and Exchange Commission. 'We need a solution designed for the
UK.'
Mr Darling used an Edinburgh speech to the Scottish region of the London
Stock Exchange to outline Labour's stance on a range of financial service
issues and to call for an overhaul of the 1986 Financial Services Act.
He said Labour would support the establishment of the proposed Personal
Investment Authority provided it met certain basic standards - 'not least a
majority on a supervisory body should come from outside the industry'.
He called for the new law on insider dealing to be tightly defined and for
offenders to be prosecuted with 'as much speed as the due process of law
will allow.'
If the new law was satisfactory, Labour would favour dealing with
misdemeanours which fell short of criminal conduct through the regulatory
system.
But he said current government proposals lacked 'clarity and precision.' The
committee of MPs scrutinising the proposed new insider dealing legislation
will begin their deliberations shortly.

THE government last night accepted a Lords backbench move to allow councils
to refuse to sell homes reserved for the elderly. At present applications by
a sitting tenant to buy such a property are referred to the environment
secretary.
But junior environment minister Lord Strathclyde accepted a change, moved by
Tory peer Lord Monk Bretton during the Housing and Urban Development Bill's

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, gave a further assurance in the Commons
yesterday that there was nothing in the Maastricht treaty obliging Britain
to rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism, Ivor Owen writes.
He rejected a suggestion by Sir Peter Tapsell (C East Lindsey), a prominent
opponent of the treaty, that at an earlier stage he had been advised that
the provision entitling Britain to opt out from monetary union did not
extend to the exchange rate mechanism.
Stressing that he had not been given any fresh advice, the prime minister
insisted that it had always been the case that the treaty did not require
Britain to rejoin the exchange rate mechanism.
Mr Major said the treaty made clear that the UK government retained
responsibility for monetary policy in stages two and three of economic and
monetary union so long as it did not participate in a single monetary
policy.
Mr Major said the government would not 'enter into a single currency unless
and until this House has explicitly approved it'.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: 'New agenda' on crime urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE silent majority must speak up against crime, Mr Tony Blair, shadow home
secretary, told the Police Federation conference in Blackpool yesterday.
He called for a new national consensus based on the principles of
partnership and shared responsibility where 'police, public and politicians
work together to construct a modern agenda for safer communities and to turn
despair into hope.'
Mr Blair won a more enthusiastic reception from the conference than Mr
Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, when he addressed it on Wednesday. Delegates
cheered loudly at the end of a speech in which Mr Blair said an entirely new
approach was needed in the fight against crime. Public morale on the issue
was low, the Crown Prosecution Service was under pressure and court
procedures were outdated. Parts of the criminal justice system were
teetering on the brink of collapse.
'A country that prides itself on its standards and its civilisation is
tolerating a dangerous and growing sickness that makes a mockery of those
standards and undermines those civilised values.'
Mr Blair said that while only a fool would excuse the commission of crime on
the grounds of an individual's upbringing, only a bigot would deny the
impact of broken homes, poverty, unemployment, poor housing and lack of
education. Attacking the government's record, he said there was no point in
complaining about juvenile crime and then shutting down residential home
places; or admitting that there was a relationship between the economy and
crime and then cutting 300,000 training places since 1981.
The federation's first debate on freemasonry yesterday led to the defeat of
a motion declaring that membership of the movement was not conducive to the
independence of the police. Proposers of the motion had sought a compulsory
registers of freemasons in the police service.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd in passionate Maastricht
defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAASTRICHT IS not a blueprint for a European superstate, Mr Douglas Hurd
told MPs yesterday as the bill implementing the treaty moved towards its
third Commons reading.
The foreign secretary used the 205th hour MPs have spent debating the
measure in the past year to warn passionately of the dangers of eroding
European competitiveness and to set out his vision of the Community's
future.
In a confident and relaxed address he assured Euro-sceptics that their fears
of a 'lurch' towards a superstate were 'misguided.' He concluded with a
clarion call to MPs before the bill moves to the Lords to 'find again' the
decisive will to act together in the 'great matters' where there was a
common European interest.
On the eve of the first anniversary of the bill's second reading Mr Hurd
devoted much of his speech to concerns that the costs which the social
chapter would impose on employers could have serious consequences for
European competitiveness.
'More and more people' were concerned about the high labour costs European
companies were 'having to shoulder' compared with their international
competitors.
The social chapter could 'place in jeopardy many of the achievements of the
last 14 years in freeing our labour market from restrictions which destroy
jobs.'
His views were rejected by Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, who
said the government's decision to exclude the social chapter was
'fundamentally unacceptable.'
Referring to the manoeuvring that had forced the government to remove the
protocol containing Britain's social chapter opt-out, he said Labour had
secured a 'valuable legal situation' that may yet allow British workers to
use the European Court to gain access to the chapter's benefits.
Turning to the future, Mr Hurd referred to a need to build a more
decentralised and diverse community that was both outward looking and 'free
trading.'
The European Commission should be more accountable and the role of national
parliaments built up. 'We are no longer heading for a community in which
diversity will be smothered or smuggled away.'
But in one of numerous interventions from Tory and Labour Euro-sceptics the
foreign secretary sidestepped a demand for assurances that control of
foreign and defence policy would not in time move to the EC. 'I cannot say
what will happen in 1996,' he said.
He also mocked Labour for its decision to abstain on last night's vote after
so many hours devoted to detailed scrutiny of the Maastricht bill. Labour
MPs had come to Westminster 'from all parts of the kingdom' to abstain in
person, he said.
Mr Cunningham said Labour could not support the bill because of the
government's decision to exclude the social chapter. But since the party's
efforts had procured for MPs an opportunity to vote on the chapter's
principle, it would be 'obtuse' for Labour to vote against it. To do so
would deny the social chapter to workers in Europe as well as Britain.
Brandishing a copy of the bill with more than half of its wording
highlighted in lime-green marker pen, he said Labour had had 'some
considerable success' in amending the measure. The government had 'sidled
away' from so many votes recently that 'we have lost count.'

FT  21 MAY 93 / Competition brings confusion to gas: Strains over industrial
fuel supplies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT MONTH the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is likely to decide whether
households will be able to choose their own gas supplier. But any move to
open up the gas market further will have to be made cautiously.
The rapid growth of competition to industrial users in the past three years
has caused embarrassing problems for British Gas and brought the threat of
legal action from rival suppliers.
The commission has been investigating the gas industry since last August and
its report will indicate whether British Gas's pipelines should be sold off
and whether competitors can enter the household supply business.
Competitors now account for about 10 per cent of the gas flowing through
British Gas's 162,000 miles of pipelines. In November 1991 competitors
supplied 1,000 industrial sites. By last September that had grown to 5,000.
Since then the market has been opened up further and rivals now serve 45,000
sites.
Competitors have captured a quarter of British Gas's industrial market and
the company is expecting the number of sites supplied by its rivals to pass
100,000 by the end of this year.
But no-one predicted how rapidly competition would develop and there have
been problems. British Gas is responsible for reading the meters at all
industrial sites - whether the sites are supplied by British Gas or its
competitors.
Once it has read the meters it bills the rival shippers for transport
charges, telling them how much gas they have supplied. The shippers, which
may supply several sites belonging to one company, must then invoice their
own customers.
British Gas's computers have not been able to cope with the extra work,
however. A backlog of invoices has built up meaning that some shippers have
not been billed for gas since November. As a result the shippers have either
been unable to invoice their own customers or have had to present them with
estimated bills.
The changeover from British Gas to rivals has also been difficult for
customers. One department store chain received bills from British Gas - with
the threat of cutting off supply - long after it had moved to a competitor.
A group of shippers has written to British Gas to complain and several have
threatened legal action for breach of their transport contracts. But Mr John
Huggins, director of gas transportation at British Gas, said the situation
was improving. The company is spending Pounds 10m on updating its computer
in the next six months so that it will be able to deal with the increased
workload.
Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas's chief executive, said yesterday: 'We're
making very good progress and in a couple of months we should be up to date
on the invoices.'
But the company's competitors still complain that the more business they
capture, the more delays it brings in billing.
Mr Huggins said: 'It's a huge task. You can get as many as 10,000 pieces of
information for the bigger shippers, and if one is missing, you can't send
them a bill.'
Just monitoring the additional gas flows has proved a logistical headache.
'It's been an explosive growth and we just didn't have a system designed to
cope with that quantity,' Mr Huggins said.
British Gas relies on its 47 competitors to tell it by fax or telex how much
gas they are pushing through the network each day. But this information is
given five days in arrears. There is no way of knowing to whom the gas
belongs once it is in the pipelines.
At the moment, British Gas provides back-up gas if shippers are short. But
if the commission recommends that pipelines be separated off - as has been
suggested by the regulator - the transport arrangements will have to be more
carefully policed.

FT  21 MAY 93 / County pacts hit Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVES have been excluded from power in most of the 26 English
counties where no party has overall control.
The pattern of control in the counties is uneven, and several councils are
relying on informal arrangements between Labour and Liberal Democrats
without electing a new council leader.
A survey by Municipal Journal found eight counties which were formerly under
Conservative control now with either Liberal Democrats or Labour forming, or
set to form, a minority administration. They are: Cambridgeshire, East
Sussex, Hampshire, Hereford and Worcester, Lincolnshire, Suffolk,
Warwickshire, and West Sussex.
Since Municipal Journal went to press Norfolk, where the Conservatives are
still the largest party, has also announced that Labour will take the chairs
of its committees. Labour was unable, however, to strike a deal with the
Liberal Democrats, so progress will need to be made on an issue-by-issue
basis and the council has no formal leader.
The most formal co-operation yet announced is in Berkshire, where Labour and
the Liberal Democrats provide joint leaders. Municipal Journal adds that
Liberal Democrats could run Devon and Dorset, where they narrowly missed
overall control, with independent backing. Labour is continuing minority
rule in Shropshire, following a suggestion of a three-way pact.
The one exception to the Conservative rout so far is Wiltshire, where the
Conservatives have provided the chairperson and Labour the vice-chairperson,
even though the Liberal Democrats were only two seats short of an overall
majority.
Both parties have denied any formal Lab-Con pact, and administration will be
on an 'issue-by-issue' basis.
Changes in policy have been sharp. In Cambridgeshire, which now has a
Liberal Democrat chairperson and a Labour vice-chairperson, the council has
announced plans to abolish a transport charge for sixth-form students
introduced by the outgoing Conservative administration, and to provide a
'cash injection' for education and social services.
Counties which were hung before the election - Avon, Bedfordshire and
Oxfordshire - are continuing the practice of not electing permanent
committee chairpersons but allowing the jobs to rotate between the parties.

Mr Neil Woods and Mr Karl Strickland broke into one of the systems operated
by Warburgs and gained full system manager status.
The two had access to the bank's computers around the world, Mr James
Richardson, prosecuting, told the court. Radio pager numbers and home
telephone numbers of Warburg computer staff were found by police at Mr
Woods' home.
The two men had swapped network user identifications and authorisation codes
enabling them to dial into other systems belonging to other companies such
as British Telecom, education establishments and the European Community, Mr
Richardson said.
Mr Woods, of Oldham, Greater Manchester, and Mr Strickland, from Liverpool,
pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to conspiring to obtain telegraphic
services dishonestly. They also admitted engaging in the unauthorised
publication of computer information.
Mr Woods also admitted causing damage to a computer owned by Central London
Polytechnic.
The two men are expected to be sentenced today.
In March this year Mr Paul Bedworth, a student from Ilkley, West Yorkshire
who joined the two men in some of their hacking activities, was acquitted of
offences under the Computer Misuse Act.
His trial was the first test of the legislation since it was passed in 1990.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Labour is urged to boost training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EDUCATION and training should go to the top of a future Labour government's
spending priorities, Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general
union, said yesterday.
Mr Edmonds was speaking at a forum attended by representatives of Training
and Enterprise Councils, which administer government-financed training
programmes in England and Wales, and by young members of his union.
The GMB is among the small number of unions seeking to raise the issue of
training among its own members and the trade union movement. Last year it
and the TGWU general union proposed that all workers should have an
entitlement to five days' training every year.
Mr Edmonds said no political party had grasped the importance of training
and education, and he questioned some Labour policies, such as obliging
companies to spend a certain amount on training.
He said the Labour party should be capable of switching its spending
priorities in favour of education and training. 'In the short term it would
mean taking money from other spending areas, but there would be a payback in
the medium term,' he said.
Mr Michael Nixon, chief executive of North London Tec, said the agenda for
Tecs was getting longer and broader. 'But we must not take our eye off youth
training and training for unemployed adults,' he said.
Mr Nixon said Tecs had lobbied hard for more money for training - not always
with success. Tecs were still aware that there was concern about the quality
of programmes, but they had improved since Tecs were set up.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Smith applauds 'full and active' union role in party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, said yesterday he was 'proud' of the
unions' links with his party and hoped they would continue to play a 'full
and active' role in it.
He believed this autumn's party conference would approve the 'twin-track
strategy' of one member, one vote for the selection of parliamentary
candidates and the creation of a 'much larger participating membership'.
Mr Smith said at the launch of the political-fund ballot of the AEEU
engineering union that he was convinced that the links between party and
unions remained as valid and as strong as ever. 'The debate is about
modernising our relationship, not ending it,' he said. 'I want to encourage
the involvement of as many trade union members as possible in all the
party's activities.'
The 900,000-strong AEEU is the first big union to hold its political-fund
ballot. Under the 1984 Trade Union Act all unions with political funds
separate from their general financial funds must win the approval of their
members for the political funds by secret ballot at least once every 10
years.
Over the next 12 months all 31 unions with such funds will ballot their
members on their continuation. In 1985-1986, when the first such ballots
took place, 20 unions acquired political funds for the first time.
Not all unions with political funds are affiliated to the Labour party.
Unaffiliated unions include the Nalgo local government union and the Civil
and Public Services Association.
Any union that wishes to finance lobbies of parliament or campaigns against
government policy is required by law to do so from a legally recognised
political fund.
There are now 51 out of the total of 301 unions - covering just under 6m
members - which have political funds totalling Pounds 18m. Only 29 of the 51
are affiliated to Labour, but they provided just over Pounds 4m of the
party's Pounds 6m income in 1991.
AEEU leaders stressed yesterday that they had decided to hold an early
political-fund ballot to ensure that the government met 75 per cent of the
Pounds 200,000 cost to the union. Two months ago the Department of
Employment decided to phase out state funding of such ballots by April 1996.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Friedrich makes record Pounds 2.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PAINTING by the greatest German romantic artist of the early 19th century,
Caspar David Friedrich, sold for Pounds 2.3m at Christie's in London
yesterday. The buyer was the J. Paul Getty Museum of Malibu, California.
'Spaziergang in der Abenddammerung' (A Walk at Dusk) depicts a lone figure,
perhaps the artist, contemplating a megalithic tomb at twilight. The price,
at the low end of the estimate, was a record for Friedrich.
This is the first 19th century German painting to be acquired by the Getty
museum.
The sale of this small, academic work is more justification for Christie's
gamble in presenting for the first time a large two-day auction of German
and Austrian art in London. Christie's expected Pounds 9m and was on target
for Pounds 18m.
In Christie's modern art section a painting of 'Sunflowers' by Emil Nolde
was on target at Pounds 661,500, while among the Old Masters 'Lucretia' by
the Renaissance artist Lucas Cranach I doubled its estimate at Pounds
309,500.
Christie's announced yesterday that on June 23 it will sell the first book
printed in English. 'The Recuyell of the Histories of Troy' was printed by
William Caxton in Bruges, Belgium in 1473, three years before he set up shop
in the precincts of Westminster Abbey. It is expected to sell for up to
Pounds 500,000.
The book is being sold by the Marquess of Bath, who has two copies. He is
disposing of 18 other duplicate copies from his library and expects to make
Pounds 1m.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Rise in jobless subsidies proposed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASED subsidies for companies willing to take on long-term unemployed
people and for the jobless individuals themselves have been proposed by Mr
Frank Field, chairman of the Commons social services committee, and
Professor Dennis Snower, professor of economics at Birkbeck College, London.
Under the Workstart scheme, to be tested in four areas soon, companies will
be given Pounds 60 a week in the first half year of employment and Pounds 30
in the second half.
Mr Field and Prof Snower view this subsidy as insufficient. They suggest:
Offering companies a voucher of Pounds 1.50 per week for each week beyond
six months that an individual has been unemployed, up to a maximum of Pounds
150 per week.
Offering individuals who had been jobless for at least four years and who
find jobs paying at least Pounds 60 a week, a subsidy up to the level of
their welfare benefits, provided that the employer is able to show that the
job amounts to a net increase in the size of the workforce.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Banks 'may not meet loan demand'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK BANKS are unlikely to be able to meet any significant increase in demand
for loans over the coming few years, IBCA, Europe's leading credit rating
agency, warned yesterday, Robert Peston writes.
An IBCA report on the seven biggest UK banks warns of a limited form of
'credit crunch' when the UK economy starts to grow, unless banks'
profitability exceeds what most have achieved since 1985.
The report says banks need to earn annual post-tax profits equal to 12 per
cent of equity if they are to make normal dividend payments and increase
their assets, mostly loans, by 2 per cent a year after adjusting for
inflation. A 2 per cent growth rate would be low by recent historical
stan-dards.
The seven leading UK banks have earned only a 7 per cent annual return on
equity over the past seven years. Only Lloyds and Bank of Scotland have
consistently earned more than 12 per cent in the period.

FT  21 MAY 93 / British Coal seeks leave to start mine closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL yesterday asked two High Court judges for a declaration that it
can lawfully shut the first 10 mines in its pit closure programme.
Lawyers for British Coal argued that correct review procedures had been
adopted since the original High Court judgment last December, which ruled
the closure proposals unlawful since no proper consultation had been carried
out.
Mr Nicholas Underhill QC, for British Coal, said the Union of Democratic
Mineworkers and Nacods, the pit deputies' union, had already agreed to the
closure of Cotgrave and Silverhill pits in Nottinghamshire.
British Coal now wanted to shut the remaining eight pits scheduled for early
closure, but this had been opposed by the National Union of Mineworkers and
Nacods.
The pits are Grimethorpe, Houghton Main and Markham Main in the Yorkshire
region, Trentham, Parkside, Betws and Taff Merthyr in Midlands and Wales and
Vane Tempest in the north-east.
Mr Underhill said the unions were wrong in arguing that British Coal had
failed to comply with the court's order that consultation procedures should
be followed which were substantially the same as the modified colliery
review procedure and included some form of independent scrutiny.
British Coal had consulted properly, he said. He asked the judges to rule
that if closure of the pits went ahead there would be no breach of the
order.
'Even if such closure would, as a matter of wording, constitute a breach of
the order, British Coal has now complied with its substantive obligations
and the order should be discharged,' he said.
Mr John Hendy QC, for the NUM, said he could not see on what basis there was
jurisdiction for yesterday's application to be made. The hearing would,
however, test whether proper consultations had taken place.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Average earnings rise by slowest rate for 25 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AVERAGE EARNINGS grew an underlying 4 per cent in the year to March, the
slowest rate of increase for 25 years and 0.5 percentage point lower than in
February.
The Department of Employment said the March figure was affected by advance
payments of bonuses and salaries in March last year ahead of the general
election and anxiety about the Labour party's plans for higher tax rates.
This was especially relevant in the service sector, where average earnings
slowed considerably. In the year to March underlying earnings rose by 3.75
per cent, the lowest figure since the statistical series began in 1985. It
compared with 4.5 per cent in the year to February. Earnings were also
driven lower by falling pay settlements, the department said. In March
British footwear workers agreed a pay increase of 2.5 per cent compared with
3.75 per cent last year, while electrical contractors' employees agreed 3.1
per cent compared with 5.8 per cent a year ago.
In manufacturing the underlying increase in average weekly earnings in the
year to March was 4.75 per cent, compared with 5 per cent in the year to
February.
Average earnings have now fallen more than 6 percentage points since they
peaked in July 1990 at 10.25 per cent.
Unit wage costs were 2.9 per cent lower in the three months to March than
they were in the same period a year ago. This was the largest fall in such
costs since the series began in 1970. Officials said unit wage costs were
falling faster than in any other G7 country.
Manufacturing productivity, or output per head, was 2.7 per cent higher in
the three months to March than it was in the three months ending December.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Fall in unemployment fails to clarify trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SMALL fall in the jobless total last month did little to remove
confusion about the trend in unemployment.
Although a third consecutive monthly decline makes the falls in February and
March look less like 'freak' figures, other data released yesterday was not
so encouraging, including a month-on-month fall in unfilled vacancies.
The government denied Labour party accusations that the figures were
'fiddled'. Mr Peter Stibbard, director of statistics at the Department of
Employment, said: 'I have been assured by Mr Mike Fogden, chief executive of
the Employment Service, that there has been no significant change in the way
the administrative rules have been applied in recent months. They have been
applied in the same way as in the second half of last year when the figures
were rising fast.'
Many analysts, however, continued to express doubts about the trend in
unemployment and said they expected to see the jobless total rise again in
the months ahead.
The employment department said that although the April fall had taken the
jobless total to its lowest level for five months, 'it was not easy to
detect a consistent trend yet'.
Unfilled vacancies at Jobcentres fell a seasonally adjusted 1,600 last month
to 124,600. Falls in such vacancies, which account for about a third of all
vacancies, tend to precede rises in unemployment. More encouragingly, they
rose on average by 6,600 in the three months to April and were up by 15,800
compared with a year ago.
Overtime hours worked in manufacturing industry were 9.11m per week in
March, a decrease of 0.07m hours per week since February.
Manufacturing employment, however, rose in March and also rose in January
and February following substantial revisions to the figures. It increased by
5,000 in March to 4.2m, for the third consecutive monthly rise.
In the regions the biggest falls in unemployment were in the south-east, the
south-west, the east Midlands and Northern Ireland. The most substantial
rises were in London, the north and the north-west.
The unadjusted count of people out of work and claiming benefit increased by
3,786 to push the figure back over the 3m mark. The new total of 3,000,511
represents 10.7 per cent of the workforce. The seasonally adjusted rate of
unemployment was unchanged at 10.5 per cent.
More people joined the dole queue in April than in March, but the monthly
unadjusted inflow of 364,800 was 1,600 fewer than a year ago. Outflows were
25,700 higher than in April a year ago.
The average monthly rate of increase in unemployment has eased considerably.
In the six months to April, a better guide to underlying trends, the average
increase was 11,900 compared with 29,700 in the previous six months.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Output of cars rises 4% on year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAR PRODUCTION in April was 4 per cent higher than in April last year,
helped by higher output for export markets, but production of commercial
vehicles fell heavily for the third month in succession.
Car production increased to 113,286 from 108,902 in the same month a year
ago statistics released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders
and the Government's Central Statistical Office show.
Car output in the first four months was 477,795. That was 5.7 per cent
higher than in the corresponding period a year ago.
Production has been boosted by higher output for export markets in spite of
the steep fall in new car sales in continental Europe.
Production in the UK is rising as a result of the increasing output of
Nissan, Honda and Toyota, the three Japanese carmakers that have located
their first European car plants in the UK.
Nissan is still planning to raise production at its Sunderland plant by 51
per cent this year to 270,000 from 179,000 last year, in spite of falling
sales of its UK-built Primera large family car.
Honda, which started output at its Swindon plant last October, is due to
produce 32,000 cars this year, while output at Toyota's Burnaston plant near
Derby is expected to total 36,000.
Car output for export markets in April was 11.9 per cent higher than a year
ago, while export production in the first four months increased by 8.2 per
cent year on year.
Production of commercial vehicles in April plunged by 33.5 per cent year on
year to 14,989, while output in the first four months at 74,188 was 17 per
cent lower than in the corresponding period a year ago.
Production has been hit by the collapse into receivership of Leyland Daf in
early February. Output has continued at both the Leyland Daf vans plant at
Birmingham and at the truck plant at Leyland, Lancashire, but it has been at
a much lower level than a year ago.
At the same time, van output by General Motors at its Vauxhall plant at
Ellesmere Port, Cheshire and its IBC Vehicles plant at Luton has also seen a
sharp fall.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Rubbish burning urged to replace landfill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCINERATION is environmentally preferable to dumping waste in landfills,
the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution said yesterday.
The commission's report is likely to influence the environment department's
thinking about a levy on landfills - licensed rubbish dumps - to encourage
more recycling and incineration.
Sir John Houghton, commission chairman, said yesterday: 'Incineration under
carefully controlled conditions is likely to represent the best practicable
environmental option for such wastes'. He added, however, that some
incinerators had been unsatisfactory.
About 90 per cent of UK waste now goes to landfill, a small amount to
recycling, and less than 10 per cent to incineration. The cost of landfill
has remained low in the UK compared with continental Europe. That is partly
because the UK's excavation of aggregates has left many convenient holes
while local residents' objections have curtailed the spread of incinerators.
The commission argues that poisons leach out from landfill sites into the
water table, even with modern technology, and it regrets the department's
recent postponement of tighter rules for landfill operators.
Mr Don Reeve, a leading member of the commission, said it would back a
landfill levy to help shift the economic balance towards incineration. The
commission has found that landfill costs now range from Pounds 5 to Pounds
30 a tonne compared with incineration costs of Pounds 15 to Pounds 30 a
tonne. It predicts that landfill costs will rise by 2000 to between Pounds
10 and Pounds 45 a tonne because of a scarcity of suitable sites and tighter
regulation.
Incineration costs will rise in the same period to between Pounds 30 and
Pounds 35 a tonne, the commission predicts, excluding the non-fossil fuel
obligation, a government subsidy which is due to end in 1998. The commission
recommends extending some form of subsidy to encourage the development of
technologies to extract energy from waste.
It also argues that landfill, which emits methane gas from the decomposition
of organic material, could contribute at least three times as much to global
warming than incineration per 1,000 tonnes of waste.
Mr David Riddle, managing director of Cory Environmental, a leading
incinerator and landfill operator, said: 'I believe that the incineration
arguments are best for large volumes of waste, although in remote places
landfill may be best.'
Mr Malcolm Chilton, general manager of Mass Energy, a group specialising in
converting waste to energy through incineration, said that councils
anticipating rising landfill prices would be attracted by incineration
schemes.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Charity chief backs moves for 'efficiency' standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S VOLUNTARY sec-tor, with a turnover of Pounds 17bn, must develop
high standards of efficiency and integrity to complement the Charity
Commission's regulatory role, Mr Richard Fries, chief charity commissioner,
said yesterday.
Increased competition in the voluntary sector, contract-based funding and
changes in charity law are all contributing to pressures for greater
efficiency. One of the issues under examination by the commission is whether
recognised standards of efficiency could be established and applied across
the sector.
Mr Fries, presenting the commission's annual report to an audience of
voluntary-sector leaders in London, said the commission was going through
changes as profound as any in its 140-year history. The 1992 Charities Act
had strengthened its supervisory powers, but it was important for it to use
them to support as well as supervise charities.
He said: 'The more we can use our powers and skills to help enhance the
integrity and efficiency of charities, whether in legal or financial
matters, the less it will be necessary to intervene to correct things which
have gone wrong.'
Mr Fries said evidence showed that difficulties were 'overwhelmingly' the
result of maladministration rather than abuse or fraud, and the commission
would attempt to act in a preventative way.
The new charities legislation has increased trustees' responsibilities and
will impose stricter accounting requirements. Computerisation of the
commission's register of charities has, for the first time, equipped it to
monitor charity accounts effectively.
Last year 4,681 new charities were registered in England and Wales but
almost equal number of defunct ones - 4,546 - were removed from the
register. There were 170,357 registered charities at the end of last year.
The commission started 718 inquiries into possible maladministration and
abuse last year, an increase of 29 per cent over 1991.
Issues under consideration by the commissioners include possible new
guidance on the extent to which charities may take part in political
activity, a sensitive area where there are few firm legal precedents. A
consultation paper is likely to go out to charities soon. The commission is
also putting out a warning that a growing practice among some organisations
of recruiting collectors by random, unsolicited telephone calls does not
meet the responsibility of trustees to main-tain control of fund-raising.
Mr Fries, a senior Home Office official who took charge of the Charity
Commission last year, is keen to dispel its former remote, supervisory image
and develop it into a body working in partnership with the voluntary sector.
Value-for-money exercises on the lines of those conducted by the Audit
Commission in local government and the National Health Service are a
possible future development.
Voluntary organisations are in growing need of financial, legal,
communications and other advice, a report by the National Council for
Voluntary Organisations concluded yesterday. It called on the government,
local authorities and other bodies funding the sector to include finance for
the development of professional advice in their grants.

FT  21 MAY 93 / CBI warning over Continental orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ORDER BOOKS are continuing to fill gradually, but exports are being affected
by the sharp economic slowdown on the Continent, especially in Germany,
members of the Yorkshire and Humberside region of the Confederation of
British Industry reported yesterday.
The CBI's regional council, meeting in Sheffield, said UK markets were still
fragile for many companies, but that an upward trend in demand was emerging.
The outlook for employment had improved but job losses were expected to
continue in the short term, with uncertainty restraining consumer spending.
Mr Peter Barker, the council's chairman, said the construction industry was
still finding the economy sluggish, but investment in plant and equipment in
other sectors was picking up as confidence mounted.
Sheffield steel processing companies supplying niche markets have reported
increasing export business in the wake of the devaluation of sterling last
September, but worry is mounting about a slowdown in Germany.
Continental prices are also competitive in high-volume steelmaking sectors,
so although Sheffield's output of steel products is at record levels,
margins and profits are under increasing strain.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Friedrich fetches record Pounds 2.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PAINTING by the greatest German romantic artist of the early 19th century,
Caspar David Friedrich, sold for Pounds 2.3m at Christie's in London
yesterday. The buyer was the J. Paul Getty Museum of Malibu, California.
'Spaziergang in der Abenddammerung' (A Walk at Dusk) depicts a lone figure,
perhaps the artist, contemplating a megalithic tomb at twilight. The price,
at the low end of the estimate, was a record for Friedrich.
This is the first 19th century German painting to be acquired by the Getty
museum.
The sale of this small, academic work is more justification for Christie's
gamble in presenting for the first time a large two-day auction of German
and Austrian art in London. Christie's expected Pounds 9m and was on target
for Pounds 18m.
On Wednesday an early 19th century scientific instrument - a precursor of
the modern calculator - sold to the Swiss dealer Edgar Mannheimer for Pounds
7.7m. The price had been estimated at Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 20,000 and the
sale was almost certainly the largest gap between an estimate and a selling
price in auction-room history. It proves what can occasionally happen when
two keen collectors are desperate for the same item.
In Christie's modern art section a painting of 'Sunflowers' by Emil Nolde
was on target at Pounds 661,500, while among the Old Masters 'Lucretia' by
the Renaissance artist Lucas Cranach I doubled its estimate at Pounds
309,500.
Christie's announced yesterday that on June 23 it will sell the first book
printed in English . 'The Recuyell of the Histories of Troy' was printed by
William Caxton in Bruges, Belgium in 1473, three years before he set up shop
in the precincts of Westminster Abbey. It is expected to sell for up to
Pounds 500,000.
The book is being sold by the Marquis of Bath, who has two copies. The
Marquis is disposing of 18 other duplicate copies from his library and
expects to make Pounds 1m. Also in the auction is 'Chroniques de France',
printed in Paris in 1493 by Antoine Verard, estimated at up to Pounds
700,000.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Statement soon on tourism chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is poised to announce a new head of the British Tourist
Authority, amid criticism from industry leaders that there was insufficient
consultation about suitable candidates and that ministers took too long to
make the appointment.
Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, is believed to have sent the
name of the new BTA chairman to Mr John Major, the prime minister, for
approval.
An announcement is expected today or early next week. The new BTA head will
also chair the English Tourist Board. The joint chairmanship is a
two-day-a-week post with an annual salary of about Pounds 35,000.
Tourist industry executives yesterday criticised the government for not
consulting them. BTA board members had not been told yesterday who their new
chairman would be.
One leading tourist industry figure said: 'I find the whole thing
disappointing. You'd think they'd come and talk to us to get a bit of advice
on how the industry would feel and whether they've got the right sort of
person.'
The government has known since last January that Mr William Davis, the
previous chairman, would not be continuing when his three-year term finished
at the end of March. Since his departure the BTA and ETB have been without
permanent heads.
The authority has also been without a chief executive since Easter, when Mr
Michael Medlicott left to join Delta Air Lines, the US car-rier.
The government appointed headhunters Tyzack Accord to find suitable
candidates and they submitted a shortlist of three before the end of March.
The delay in making a decision has left the tourist industry leaderless in
the approach to the summer season.
Mr John Lewis, the authority's interim chairman, was considered a possible
candidate for the permanent post, but is understood to have withdrawn his
name.

The current basic charge on the exchange's Talisman settlement system for UK
equities will be reduced by 20 per cent (from 50p to 40p per Pounds 1,000
lot) with effect from May 1.
Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, the exchange's chairman, described the reduction as
'an important first step in lowering the cost of settlement to the market'.
He hoped to announce a further rebate in the coming months.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Exchange warns companies on leaks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES listed on the London Stock Exchange should make public statements
rather than leaking price-sensitive information, Mr Martin Hall, the
exchange's head of public policy, said yesterday, Peter Martin writes.
On Friday the exchange censured London International Group for leaking news
about lower-than-expected profits to a limited number of analysts and
investors.
In a speech in Edinburgh, Mr Hall said the market did not like disagreeable
shocks, and the best way of avoiding them was the immediate publication of
price-sensitive material.
'Currently there is reluctance to make such formal statements, bred of fear
that the market will over-react because they are relatively rare events,' he
said. 'If they were more commonly used they would be received by the market
with a better sense of proportion.'
There could also be useful regular dialogue between companies and the
market. 'But such dialogue should not be the means of imparting selectively
what all the world should be told,' he said.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Vosper staff accept 7% pay deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOSPER THORNEYCROFT, the shipbuilder, announced yesterday it had reached a
two-year, 7 per cent pay agreement with its workforce of 2,000. The deal
involves a 3 per cent basic wage increase this year with a further 4 per
cent in 1994.
But the pay increase was conditional on the workforce accepting the
introduction of a three-shift system of working and the introduction of
individual worker certification of quality levels in prod-uction.
Two small improvements in benefits were included in the agreement.
Manual workers will be able to claim company sick pay from the first day of
sickness absence and not the second, bringing them into line with
white-collar staff. The rate of the sick pay will rise by 3 per cent this
year and a further 4 per cent in 1994.
Mr Martin Jay, the company's managing director, said yesterday that the new
deal would improve steel shipbuilding manufacture.
'Our order books are at a record high,' he said. 'There has been a 50 per
cent improvement in productivity in steel shipbuilding over the past six
years. The new deal will give us even greater flexibility than we already
have.'
The Vosper Thorneycroft workforce voted 58 per cent in favour of the pay
agreement, with 42 per cent against.

FT  21 MAY 93 / BR freight to be split for sell-off: Rail businesses could
pass into foreign ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST OF British Rail's Pounds 700m-a-year freight business is to be split
into three regional companies and sold to the private sector in 1995, the
government announced yesterday.
One stock market analyst estimated that the three companies - mainly
comprising BR's profitable coal, steel, iron ore and petroleum operations -
could have a combined value of Pounds 500m in a trade sale or stock market
flotation.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said he had already received
inquiries from companies interested in buying the freight operations, and
added that management buy-outs would be considered.
He also opened up the possibility that the freight businesses could pass
into foreign ownership. 'We have had visits from overseas,' he said.
The freight operations are being sold as part of the government's plans for
the privatisation of BR. The plans will start taking effect in April next
year if the Railways Bill, currently before parliament, is passed.
Mr MacGregor said the government's aim was to create a 'thriving,
competitive' railfreight business. He said: 'Our proposals offer the best
hope of getting more freight back on to the railways.'
The plans envisage that BR's profitable bulk freight business, which made an
operating profit of Pounds 67.5m on turnover of Pounds 505.5m in the year to
March 1992, will be split into three geographical units next year in
readiness for privatisation.
These units will include BR's contract services businesses, carrying goods
such as china clay, chemicals, food and drink.
These are among the few profitable parts of the heavily lossmaking
Railfreight Distribution business.
Existing bulk freight contracts will be evenly split between the three
geographical units. But once in the private sector the companies will be
free to compete against one another for existing and new business in all
parts of the country.
They will also have to compete with any new companies wishing to enter the
railfreight market, all of which will enjoy equal rights of access to the
railway tracks once privatisation takes place.
Mr MacGregor said the freight operations were being split into three to
promote competition.
'BR's customers very strongly agree with the idea of breaking up BR's
monopoly,' he said.
One other part of BR's freight operations - Rail Express Systems, the BR
business responsible for Royal Mail trains - is to be privatised as soon as
possible, but the government has not yet decided what form the sale should
take.
The lossmaking freight operations, including Freight-liner, the container
business, will have to stay with whatever is left of BR after privatisation
while the government looks for ways of getting the private sector involved
in running them. These account for about 20 per cent of BR's freight
business in revenue terms.
BR will also retain responsibility for Continental freight for the present
so that it can see the launch of Channel tunnel services through their
initial phase.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Lecturers warned against action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER EDUCATION college employers yesterday threatened to remove lecturers
from the payroll if they refused to mark college registers.
The move is an escalation of the dispute between the National Association of
Teachers in Further and Higher Education and the College Employers Forum
over the negotiation of new contracts following the transfer of the colleges
from local education authority to government control last month.
Natfhe staged a national strike yesterday in protest at proposed new
contracts, and claimed to have closed most of the colleges in Wales and
northern England. It has requested its members to continue action by
refusing to mark registers.
But Mr Roger Ward, the forum's chief negotiator, said lecturers who did not
mark registers would be removed from the payroll. He said that about one
third of the 360 college principals involved had already sent letters to
staff containing the threat, while the rest would follow within a week.
He said: 'This is the regrettable and inevitable result of Natfhe's
strong-arm tactics. We look forward to the dropping of industrial action and
returning to the bargaining table.'
Mr Ward said refusing to mark registers was a 'serious breach of contract'
and could leave employers liable under fire and safety regulations.
Meanwhile, Mr John Patten, the education secretary, yesterday published
draft charters for further and higher education. The charters are meant to
raise standards in colleges and universities as part of the Citizens'
Charter initiative and mostly concern availability of information for both
students and employers.
They also require technical alterations to the university admissions system
and independent inspections for further education colleges.
Principals, lecturers' unions and the National Union of Students generally
welcomed the documents. However, Professor Ray Cowell, vice-chancellor of
Nottingham Trent University, criticised the omission of partnerships with
industry from the charter and described its views on students as 'naive and
dated'. University leaders yesterday called for at least Pounds 3.2bn to
repair buildings and expand for the future. The Committee of
Vice-Chancellors and Principals said Pounds 1.35bn was needed to clear a
10-year backlog of building maintenance work.

FT  21 MAY 93 / MacGregor fails to avert rebellion threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT was last night still facing a possible revolt next week over
British Rail privatisation - in spite of attempts by Mr John MacGregor,
transport secretary, to calm fears of potential rebel Tory MPs.
Sir Keith Speed, Tory MP for Ashford who is leading the protests, said after
an hour-long meeting with Mr MacGregor that he may still vote against the
government when the Railways bill is debated on Monday and Tuesday.
At least eight Tory MPs have signed amendments to the bill that would allow
BR itself to compete for passenger service franchises. The MPs also want
legal guarantees to ensure that concessionary fare schemes for pensioners
and young people and London Travelcards continue under privatisation.
In theory, nine rebels would be enough to overturn the government's majority
of 18, if all opposition parties attend in full strength and assuming the
rebels' amendments are selected by the Speaker.
However, there were signs last night that Mr MacGregor may have offered
sufficient assurances - particularly on concessionary travel cards - to
bring some rebels into line. Government business managers will increase
pressure over the weekend on others.
Sir Keith said the rebels would consider their position. As a last resort
the government could probably rely on several of Northern Ireland's Unionist
MPs being absent.
Mr MacGregor hinted that he would try to head off the rebellion by making
clear that concessionary fare schemes and the London Travelcard were likely
to remain commercially attractive after privatisation.
He remained strongly opposed, however, to any move towards allowing BR to
bid for franchises - which he believes would undermine the main objective of
the bill, the transfer of the operation of rail services from the public to
private sector. Instead BR managers are being offered financial incentives
to launch management buy-outs.

MR JOHN MacGregor, transport secretary, last night met Conservative MPs in
an attempt to head off a threatened rebellion next Monday over the
privatisation of British Rail.
Sir Keith Speed, Conservative MP for Ashford, said before the meeting that
he was prepared to vote against the government if ministers did not back
down. He could threaten the Conservative's 18-strong Commons majority if
joined by more than a handful of colleagues.
At least eight Tory MPs have signed a series of amendments intended to
guarantee the future of concessionary fare schemes for pensioners and young
people, and of the London travelcard. The MPs also want BR itself to be able
to compete for passenger service franchises.
Mr MacGregor last night hinted he would try to head off the rebellion by
making clear that concessionary fare schemes and the London travelcard were
likely to remain commercially attractive after privatisation.
He said on BBC radio: 'Just as it is happening at the moment and there is
advantage in it, so there will be in the future.'
Mr MacGregor remained strongly opposed, however, to any move towards
allowing BR to bid for franchises - which he believes would undermine the
main objective of the bill, the transfer of the operation of rail services
from the public to private sector.
Instead BR managers are being offered financial incentives to launch
management buyouts.
Mr MacGregor's stance appeared unlikely to satisfy Sir Keith, who complained
that private finance was unlikely to be forthcoming for management buyouts.
Government business managers will be working hard during the weekend to
persuade other Conservatives not to defy the government.
