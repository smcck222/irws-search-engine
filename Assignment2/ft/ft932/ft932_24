FT  21 MAY 93 / Superdrug cuts prices of condoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPERDRUG, the high street discount retailer, yesterday cut the price of
condoms by up to a third at all 680 of its shops, signalling a fresh round
of its continuing price-war with its main rival, Boots, the UK's largest
chemist chain, Gary Mead writes.
This is the third significant price reduction by Superdrug in 18 months.
Superdrug cut prices on fine perfumes by 30 per cent at 42 of its stores in
the run-up to last Christmas.
At the end of April it took 25 per cent off the prices of branded suncare
products, and Boots responded with reductions of 30 per cent.
Prices of 19 types of condom from the two leading brands - Durex and Mates -
and Femidom, a newly launched female condom, will be cut immediately. The UK
condom market - worth about Pounds 45m at retail prices - is the subject of
a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry.
Superdrug estimated yesterday that its price reductions would save a typical
couple more than Pounds 30 annually.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London Stock Exchange yesterday announced a reduction in its settlement
charges to members amounting to about Pounds 7m per year.
The current basic charge on the exchange's Talisman settlement system for UK
equities will be reduced by 20 per cent (from 50p to 40p per Pounds 1,000
lot), with effect from May 1.
Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, the exchange's chairman, described the reduction as
'an important first step in lowering the cost of settlement to the market',
adding that he hoped to announce a further rebate in the coming months.

FT  21 MAY 93 / IRA blast injures 20 people in Belfast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A 1,000lb IRA bomb exploded in the centre of Belfast yesterday, injuring 20
people and badly damaging the headquarters of the Ulster Unionist party, as
counting started for Northern Ireland's local elections.
The explosion came as early returns from the polls, held on Wednesday,
suggested that the hardline parties on both sides of the sectarian divide
had performed strongly, an outcome which would damage the prospects of
renewed inter-party talks on the province's future.
The bomb, similar in size to the one which killed three people and badly
damaged the Baltic Exchange in London last year, was placed in a skip lorry
in a side street between the Europa Hotel and the Grand Opera House, yards
from the UUP headquarters. It was near the spot where another powerful IRA
bomb was detonated in December 1991.
The device went off during the morning rush-hour, as the Army attempted to
disarm it by two controlled explosions. It badly damaged the Europa Hotel
and surrounding offices and shops, blowing out windows over a wide area.
None of the injured was seriously hurt. The IRA claimed responsibility for
the blast.
The Belfast Opera House - repaired at a cost of Pounds 1m after being hit by
the IRA bomb of late 1991 - took the full force of the explosion. A huge
hole was blasted in the side of the 98-year-old building.
The bombers evaded an intensive security cordon which has been thrown around
the city centre during the week leading up to the elections, in which 582
councillors are to be elected to 26 district councils in the province.
Mr Jim Wilson, general secretary of the UUP, said: 'I would suggest the IRA
have identified their real enemy, the Ulster Unionist people of the
province. They obviously know they didn't write us off at the ballot box and
they won't do it with a bomb either.'
Dr Joe Hendron, Social Democratic and Labour party MP for the nationalist
area of west Belfast, said: 'I look on the people who did this as gangsters.
It is a dastardly act and I condemn all those associated with planning it
and executing it.'
The final results of the elections are not expected until this afternoon, as
the proportional representation system used in the province entails numerous
counts of transferable votes.
Early returns suggest that the UUP vote has slipped from 31 per cent to 30
per cent, while the vote for the hardline Democratic Unionist party, and for
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has strengthened in the urban
centres of Belfast and Derry.
If this trend is confirmed in the final result it will prove a bitter
disappointment to Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary. He
hoped that a strengthened vote for the UUP and the SDLP, the more moderate
parties on either side of the sectarian divide, would facilitate his efforts
to renew the inter-party talks on the province's political future, which
were abandoned without agreement last November.
At Westminster yesterday Sir Patrick told MPs that proposals the government
was drawing up for the province's future would 'give some direction and
focus' to any renewed talks.
But he said that the government had no plans to publish its suggestions  -
expected to set a framework for devolved government in the province. The
government wants to keep details of negotiations confidential, he said.
Sir Patrick is due to meet the leaders of Northern Ireland's main political
parties, once the local elections are com-pleted.
Two Anglo-Irish conference meetings are expected before any round-table
talks start, however, suggesting a resumption of negotiations is at least
another month away.
There also seems to be only lukewarm support among local political leaders
for such talks.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Nadir escape was 'ridiculously easy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ESCAPE from the UK of Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive Turkish Cypriot
businessman, was 'ridiculously easy' to organise, in spite of police
surveillance, according to the Hampshire businessman who helped him jump his
Pounds 3m bail.
'Anyone in the street could have done what I did,' Mr Peter Dimond, a former
aeroplane dealer, said. The two-plane journey had been planned in a matter
of days. 'It was so simple it was unreal.'
Speaking from northern Cyprus, Mr Dimond said he had no regrets about his
part in the affair. He said his role had been in arranging the flight from
the Compton Abbas airfield in Dorset which took Mr Nadir to Beauvais near
Paris.
Mr Dimond, a long-time family friend of Mr Nadir through his wife, Hope,
says he became involved in the escape through frustration at the treatment
of Mr Nadir by the Serious Fraud Office.
'We have watched very closely the way the situation has been handled,' he
said. 'There was a time when it was time to go and so his friends said 'OK,
let's do it'. It was just an act of friendship - like giving a friend a lift
in a car.'
A regular user of Compton Abbas airfield, Mr Dimond approached the owner, Mr
Clive Hughes, a friend of several years standing, a week before Mr Nadir's
departure to book a plane for himself and a friend.
He said Mr Hughes had agreed to pilot the twin-engined Piper Seneca plane to
Beauvais as a favour to him. 'The pilots did not know who they were
carrying,' Mr Dimond said. 'My part of the operation was that. The owner and
pilot knew me - they wouldn't just go off and take anybody.'
Early on the morning of May 4 Mr Nadir left his flat in London's Belgravia,
arriving with Mr Dimond at Compton Abbas airfield in the late morning. Mr
Hughes said yesterday that Mr Nadir, in dark glasses and a hat, was
introduced to him as an 'aviation friend' of Mr Dimond.
'I did it as a private flight for a friend,' said Mr Hughes. He said the
plane's intercom had been broken during the hour long flight and he had not
spoken to Mr Nadir, who had sat, facing backwards, in the rear of the plane.
The only payment he had received was Pounds 300 to cover the cost of petrol.
Mr Clive Vleiland-Boddy, owner of the Piper plane, registration number
GBSPG, yesterday said he had not known who was using it.
Under new EC regulations, Mr Hughes says he had not been required to carry
out any customs check, apart from handing out a leaflet explaining passport
regulations for leaving England.
When the plane arrived in Beauvais, Mr Dimond and Mr Nadir had hurried
across the airfield to join the second aircraft, a Citation Cessna,
registration N-11HJ, which had flown from Hatfield to meet them.
'I left them at the aircraft side. Peter knew I had to get back in a hurry,'
said Mr Hughes.
Mr Dimond yesterday denied that he had arranged the second aircraft which
later took Mr Nadir and Mr Dimond from Beauvais to Cyprus, via Vienna and
Istanbul.
Mr Hamlin, owner of Hamlin jets, which manages the Hatfield airfield where
the Citation is based, yesterday confirmed the plane had travelled to
Beauvais and then on to northern Cyprus, but he had no idea beforehand what
the purpose of the flight was.
Mr Dimond said he had no intention of returning to England. If he was found
aiding Mr Nadir to jump bail, he could face charges under British law,
although, in practice, it would be impossible to extradite him without the
co-operation of the north Cypriot authorities. 'I do not intend to become a
fall guy for the frustration and anger of the people who were told to look
for us,' he said.
A former car dealer, and licensed pilot, he set up Southcoast Aviation, an
aircraft trading company, in 1987. After this folded at the end of the
1980s, Mr Dimond had, he admitted, been facing financial difficulties.
Mr Dimond denied that he had been paid for his role in the affair. 'I did it
because I was sick of the system. I thought this man deserves to get out and
have a right to free speech - there was no payment.'

Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, yesterday praised Kyrgyzstan for 'a
bold and courageous reform programme that should be a model for all states
of the former Soviet Union', writes George Graham in Washington. Mr Bentsen
spoke after meeting Kyrgyzstan's President Askar Akayev, who was in
Washington for talks with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
Kyrgyzstan is the first country to qualify for the IMF's new financing
facility to help the economies of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union
make the leap from communism to capitalism.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Li Peng's illness a boost for rival
</HEADLINE>

   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIRMATION yesterday that Mr Li Peng, the ailing Chinese premier, would
remain out of view for the moment has fuelled speculation about not only his
physical recovery but also his political well-being.
Mr Li's continued absence has boosted the stocks of his chief rival, Mr Zhu
Rongji, the reformist vice-premier and former mayor of Shanghai. Mr Zhu this
week is making a high-profile visit to Canada and to Latin America.
China's foreign ministry may have inadvertently encouraged talk about Mr
Li's future when it told reporters that the premier would not be meeting
visiting dignitaries, including Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign
minister.
The 65-year-old Mr Li has not been seen in public since the last week of
April. He was photographed playing tennis with Mr Goh Chok Tong, the
visiting Singapore prime minister, on April 20.
On April 26, Chinese officials announced that Mr Li would not be able to
keep an appointment with Philippine President Fidel Ramos because he was
suffering from a 'cold'. He was also obliged to cancel a 12-day visit to
Central Asia.
One month later, no photographs have appeared of a recuperating Mr Li, nor
has the Chinese press revealed that his condition required hospitalisation.
In light of persistent reports that Mr Li is suffering heart problems,
Chinese officials have long since given up trying to pretend that he has
been laid low by the flu.
Mr Li's lingering health problems have now taken on a political dimension,
in the view of Chinese and western observers. 'You've got to see Zhu Rongji
as the big winner in all this,' said a long-serving Beijing diplomat. 'It
certainly raises questions about Li Peng's political future.'
'Li had weathered so many political storms in the past that his survival
skills were regarded as one of his assets,' the official added.
'But this illness has put a dent in the perception that he is
indestructible.'
Adding to Mr Li's political difficulties may be the fact that he is not
particularly popular in any case, and therefore his colleagues may be less
inclined to indulge health problems. Speculation that his 'illness' may
indeed be political and not physical has also been revived; although
evidence suggests otherwise.
Mr Li was 're-elected' to a second five-year term as premier at the recent
National People's Congress, but an unprecedented 10 per cent of the more
than 2,000 delegates either voted against him or abstained. Mr Li, who is
associated with leadership hardliners, is blamed by many Chinese for the
bloody crackdown on the Tiananmen pro-democracy demonstrators in June 1989.
Mr Li's continued absence has reinforced perceptions that Mr Zhu, also 65,
who was confirmed as senior vice premier at the NPC, is the 'strong man' in
the government in any case. Added to responsibilities for the day-to-day
work of the administration have been the 'high profile' meeting and greeting
functions normally reserved for the premier.
Western officials who have seen Mr Zhu in action recently say that he has
carried off his additional duties with conspicuous self-confidence. His
performance at a meeting in Shanghai earlier this month at a meeting of
former world leaders has been singled out for praise.
Western officials say that it is somewhat ironic that attention has been
focusing on the health of Mr Li, who is a mere stripling by the normal
standards of China's gerontocratic leadership. He is 23 years younger than
paramount leader, Mr Deng Xiaoping.
Mr Jiang Zemin, China's Communist party boss, president, and chief of its
Military Commission, may have also had his stocks boosted by the continued
absence of Mr Li. An apparently vigorous Mr Jiang, 66, has also been much in
evidence, receiving a whole range of visitors, including Mr Pierre Cardin,
the fashion designer.

PRINCE Norodom Sihanouk, the Cambodian leader and former monarch who has
been criticised for living abroad during the implementation of a United
Nations-sponsored peace plan, announced yesterday that he would return to
Cambodia from his home in Beijing for the general election due to begin on
Sunday.
'I will be near my beloved and respected Cambodian people,' he said in a
statement.
Among those who have urged him to return to Cambodia to support the election
are Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, and President
Francois Mitterrand of France.
Prince Sihanouk's associates say he has remained in Beijing partly for
medical treatment and partly because he wants to save his political
ammunition for the period of confusion which is likely to follow the
election.
He says he will do his best to reconcile Cambodia's warring factions in a
coalition government; he, his family and his staff will not vote 'because we
have to show our strict neutrality'.
Fighting continued in various parts of the country yesterday between the
Cambodian government and the Khmer Rouge, which has vowed to disrupt the
election after withdrawing from a 1991 peace agreement. A Cambodian working
for the International Rice Research Institute was killed on the road from
Phnom Penh to Kompong Cham when his vehicle was ambushed on Wednesday.
There were also renewed outbreaks of political violence ahead of next week's
election. The UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) said a member of
the royalist party Funcinpec was allegedly shot dead in his house by
government soldiers. Troops were also accused of killing two members of
another political party called Molinaka.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, the Untac chief, yesterday described the election
campaign as a 'great success'. He said that even if the highest standards of
mature democracies were not met, the voting would 'certainly be the freest
and fairest elections in Cambodia's recent history'.
Mr Akashi said he would declare on May 28, the last day of voting, whether
he considered the conduct of the election to have been free and fair.

MALAYSIA says it intends to create an airline to operate on domestic and
international routes, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, prime minister, said the new airline was necessary
because Malaysia Airlines (MAS), the country's national carrier, was
expanding so fast that it had become 'overstretched'. He said the new
airline could be based on Pelangi Air, a small carrier which already
operates on some domestic and regional routes.
The prime minister said the government would not take up a stake in the
proposed new airline. 'We want the private sector to do business. We
regulate the business', said Dr Mahathir.

A REMARKABLE experiment is taking place in Kyrgyzstan, the poorest of the
former Soviet republics. It has introduced a new currency with strong
support from the west. On its success depends the future of the state
itself, the viability of new currencies in the post-Soviet world and the
reputation of the multilateral financial institutions.
Kyrgyzstan is a small, landlocked state on the Chinese border. It has an
ethnically divided population - the Kyrgyz are a bare majority with a 25 per
cent Russian-speaking minority which dominates production and forms the
majority in the capital Bishkek.
The industrial sector of Kyrgyzstan is like that of all ex-Soviet states,
but more so. The Frunze agricultural machinery plant made one type of
machinery for the former Soviet trading bloc which is no longer in demand
and for which it usually cannot get steel anyway. A sugar refinery got its
raw material from Cuba, hauled across central Asia from the Black Sea. Both
have all but stopped production.
This is a grim position in which to find oneself 'independent' - especially
since its years as a Soviet state have left what Kyrgyzstan's foremost
economist, Mr Turar Koichuyev, calls a 'psychology of dependence'.
But in introducing the som ('catfish' in Russian) in place of the rouble, it
blazes a trail for the other members of the Commonwealth of Independent
States - only one of which, Ukraine, has introduced its own currency, and
that without an accompanying programme approved by the International
Monetary Fund.
The effects of the introduction of the som have so far been both
dramatically good and disturbingly bad. Its first trading session took place
on Monday in the street outside the National Bank, where some Dollars 2m was
exchanged for som issued the week before.
It held its introductory rate of 4 to the dollar, while on the black market
the official rate of Rbs150 to a som doubled to around Rbs300. A government
decree that, after a five-day transition period, the rouble may no longer be
used seems to have been obeyed.
But it has caused an inflamed reaction in neighbouring Uzbekistan. The
border between the two states has been closed, money transfers and trading
of any kind stopped and gas supplies shut off. Uzbek President Islam
Karimov, no friend of the pro-western leaders of Kyrgyzstan, accused the
Kyrgyz of plotting to flood his republic with unwanted roubles. His action
threatens to strain further the bad relations between the Kyrgyz and the
ethnic Uzbeks who live in the border areas of Kyrgyzstan.
The currency's introduction was badly executed and badly advertised; the
result has been that only Rbs7bn to Rbs10bn of the estimated stock of
Rbs30bn in the country were exchanged for som in the five days. Residents of
Bishkek grumble about the bright new currency - accusing the government of
raising prices under its cover, and fearing that the government had given
them an unconvertible currency.
The som is a test case in two ways. First, it poses a colossal challenge to
the leadership of Kyrgyzstan: a leadership which, under the presidency of Mr
Askar Akayev and the premiership of Mr Tursumbek Chyngyshev, attempts to
chart a pro-market course.
Mr Chyngyshev says: 'We believe we had no choice but to introduce the som:
it allows us to escape from the inflation of the rouble and to create our
own economy.'
The chance is there, but the task is difficult.
The second test is of the IMF and, to a lesser extent, the other
multilateral financial agencies. The IMF, some six months ago, switched its
policy advice dramatically: having previously advised the former Soviet
states to stay in the rouble zone, it concluded - after observing the
actions of the central bank of Russia in supporting enterprises with a flood
of credit - that the only way ex-Soviet states could fight inflation was to
control their own currencies.
Says Mr Harry Trines, the resident man from the IMF: 'It became clear that
in the present circumstances no one could reduce inflation while remaining
tied to the rouble. And thus the IMF executive board decided that if the
(ex-Soviet) countries wanted their own programmes with the IMF they must
have their own currency.'
This decision. meant that the IMF, and through it the richer countries of
the world who provide aid to the former Soviet Union, were implicitly
offering to support the new currencies if the state could commit itself to
an IMF programme with its familiar features of monetary stability, budget
stringency and rapid privatisation.
Kyrgyzstan, uniquely - outside the Baltic states which are not part of the
CIS - has done so, earlier this month signing on to a tough programme and
receiving Dollars 23m as a first tranche of an Dollars 85m package of
support. These funds form the reserves with which the National Bank has
supported the currency.
In all, Kyrgyzstan should receive Dollars 400m in loans, including a Rbs75bn
(about Dollars 100m) from Russia which is promised but the delivery of which
must be in some doubt. The World Bank and the Japanese government are to put
in about Dollars 110m in budget support - in the form of goods which will be
sold in Kyrgyzstan.
For the foreign experts now in Bishkek, the future seems clear enough: a
programme (barely begun) which pushes enterprises into the private sector -
though there are signs that the state favours worker-ownership, with which
the Fund would be unhappy. It will also trade on its few assets - wool;
fruit and vegetables; hydro-electric power; natural beauty; minerals
including gold; and a relatively well-educated population.
A final asset is the harsh realism of people and leaders alike. Says Mr
Chyngyshev: 'We have things we can sell, but they are not yet of world
quality. We haven't got the equipment or the experience, and we lack the
money to buy the equipment. It's going to be very hard - it's inevitable.'

FT  21 MAY 93 / Business pulls Taiwan closer to mainland: Pressures to ease
Taipei's curbs on links with Beijing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE new Boeing 747-400s will line up later this year in Taipei's Chiang Kai
Shek airport bearing the colours of the world's second-largest container
shipping group, Evergreen. The jets will fly to a number of international
destinations, but a domestic issue lies at the heart of the strategy: China.
During 1992, more than 1.5m Taiwanese visited China, via a third country. If
prohibitions on direct transport were lifted, Eva Air's president, Mr Frank
Hsu, estimates that the number of travellers to China could treble
immediately.
The momentum of tourists and capital already flooding from the Republic of
China back to its erstwhile Communist enemy is placing Taiwan's government
under increasing pressure to relax these restrictions on direct links.
Economists provisionally estimate that the lifting of the prohibition on
direct transport could add at least 1 percentage point to gross national
product, from savings on trans-shipment of products via Hong Kong. But, it
is gradually becoming apparent that the government is no longer prepared to
budge.
The government's own game plan for relations with the People's Republic is
unequivocally stated in its 1991 Guidelines for Unification. The current
'short-term' phase, is one of 'exchanges and reciprocity', as exemplified in
'practical' bilateral discussions that took place in Singapore last month.
The two countries can progress into the phase of 'mutual trust and
co-operation' only if China renounces the use of violence to bring this
'renegade province' back to the bosom of the motherland and if it recognises
Taiwan as a separate political entity.
China has refused to give ground on any of these but it has already started
putting pressure on Taiwan to recommence the 'three links' - post, transport
and commerce - which are clearly identified with the second phase.
Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui in a press conference yesterday again
emphasised the need for mutual trust and recognition before these links are
put into effect.
With the build-up to the Singapore meeting - the first quasi-official talks
to take place between the two sides since the Nationalists' defeat in 1949 -
there had been a growing sense that this process could be accelerated.
The pro-business President Lee has recently consolidated his power-base
through the appointment of an acolyte as premier, and brokers argued that he
would be prepared to push towards direct links in order to attract support
from the business community.
But the government has started to give the lie to this. Last week, the
Securities and Exchange Commission was encouraged to put the brakes on
listed companies' investment in China, prohibiting the raising of capital on
the stock market for the purposes of funding projects in China.
In addition, a lobby of senior Taiwanese bankers were invited by Beijing to
set up branches in the mainland, but this request was turned down by the
Taiwanese government.
Mr Jason Hu, government spokesman, admitted that holding back on direct
links was a political trump card, and China's insistence on direct links
during the Singapore talks has made the value of this card even more
apparent.
Mr Hu said the business community would have to be patient. 'Most business
people understand that they gain nothing in these links, if they lose
Taiwan,' he argued.
But patience appears to be a rare commodity. As the costs of land and labour
continue to escalate in affluent Taiwan, there has been a flood of
investment capital through Hong Kong and into China.
Taiwan is now the single largest source of visitors to the British colony,
because despite the inefficiencies of investing indirectly, China relocation
has become an economic imperative.
More than Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.5bn) has been invested across the Taiwan
Straits and the focus is beginning to progress beyond basic low-cost
assembly plants, despite the continued aggressive stance of Beijing.
The Evergreen group is the most notable in preparing a massive transport
network with which to cement direct links. Eva Air, which had its inaugural
flight just two years ago, is buying 20 aircraft with options on a further
eight.
Mr Hsu said: 'We would be able to start direct flights within three months
of an announcement. We have made some studies and would want to fly to
Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen and Guangzhou.' He admitted that if the fare
structure was attractive, Eva would take aircraft off international routes
to help build up its China business.
Uniglory, another Evergreen group company, has recently purchased five small
container ships in anticipation of feeder services running from the coast of
Fujian province down to Evergreen's container terminal in Kaoshiung.
Ironically Mr Y F Chang, Evergreen's founder and chairman, is an avowed
supporter of the opposition Democratic Progressive party, which endorses
Taiwanese independence - an event which many still believe would trigger a
Chinese invasion. Evergreen's corporate strategy, however, suggests that for
the chairman, business comes before politics.
The same may be true for the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) party, which is trying
to control a flood of investment into China, whilst its own companies take a
more conciliatory stance.
China Development Corporation, a listed company whose largest single
shareholder is the Kuomintang, is currently negotiating a stake in a
mainland-controlled satellite project, Apstar-2.
A government-linked joint venture with China in regional telecommunications
and television transmission - an area fraught with political sensitivities -
could hardly be said to put out the right signals to other local businesses.
The investment flows continue to build up, despite officials's threats to
tighten restrictions. By 1997, links with Hong Kong - which then reverts to
China - will, in effect, breach the prohibition on the 'three directs', and
Eva Air may have secured mainland routes by then. But in the meantime, the
Kuomintang looks set to continue its lonely battle against excessive
business links with the enemy.

<TEXT>
SINO-BRITISH talks on the future of Hong Kong resume in Beijing today with
the British side hoping that discussions can progress towards substantial
negotiations.
China yesterday gave approval to three key Hong Kong franchises after an
informal meeting in the colony of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group,
suggesting a further thawing in relations between the two sides.
The contracts had already been approved by the Hong Kong government, but
were caught up in the political backlash that followed the announcement of
Governor Chris Patten's political reform proposals. China said it would not
recognise new franchises handed out by Hong Kong without Beijing approval.
Following the meeting, the Wharf group received approval for its HKDollars
5bn (Pounds 420m) cable television project, while Hong Kong Electric has a
15-year extension on its operating licence as monopoly supplier of
electricity to Hong Kong island. The third contract was for a land-fill
site.
Wharf had already spent HKDollars 600m on the cable project on the basis of
unofficial assurances from China, while the Hong Kong Electric franchise was
never considered at risk. The timing of the announcement, however, is
considered auspicious.
Last week, the Sino-British land commission agreed on the current fiscal
year's land disposal programme. However, the fate of the colony's Container
Terminal 9 still hangs in the balance.
There are indications that a full Joint Liaison Group meeting may be agreed
for June, when the terminal contract will be discussed. The agreements
suggest China is prepared to move forward on pressing business matters
concerning Hong Kong.
The two previous rounds of broader Beijing talks were dominated by a Chinese
re-statement of 'guiding principles', which left little room for discussion
of specific issues such as the shape of a possible compromise. Beijing
charges that Mr Patten's plans to broaden the franchise for Legislative
Council elections go beyond understandings reached in negotiations on Hong
Kong's transition to Chinese rule in 1997.
Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's ambassador to Beijing and head of its
negotiating team, told reporters in Hong Kong before leaving for China that
his aim was to reach agreement on 'practical arrangements' for Legco
elections due in 1994-95. Sir Robin had been visiting the colony for
consultations.
A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, meanwhile, said the Sino-British talks
would produce 'positive results' if both sides were guided by previous
agreements on the future of Hong Kong. Earlier this week, Sir Robin was
carpeted by China over a meeting in London between Mr Douglas Hurd,
Britain's foreign secretary, and the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual
leader.
Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, reported that Sir Robin had
received a 'stern warning' from a foreign ministry official. It described
the Dalai Lama as a 'political exile preaching so-called independence for
Tibet and engaged in activities aimed at splitting China.'

yesterday. The two countries established diplomatic relations in January
1992. Diplomats said Beijing promised Israel it would not sell missiles to
Iran or Syria as it did not want to put obstacles in the way of Middle East
peace. China sold Silkworm missiles to Iran during the 1980s, according to

<TEXT>
MR John Rollwagen, President Bill Clinton's choice to be deputy secretary of
commerce, has withdrawn after his Senate confirmation hearings were delayed
by investigation of possible insider trading at his former company.
The withdrawal is another setback in the administration's slow filling of
the top positions in each department.
The Commerce department is notably short of Democratic appointees; Mr Ron
Brown, the secretary, is the only nominee yet confirmed by the Senate.
Lower-level nominees have been held up by the delay over Mr Rollwagen's
confirmation.
He is a former chairman of Cray Research and said in a letter to Mr Brown
that the Securities and Exchange Commission had requested 'background
information' from him. The 'unplanned delay' in his Senate confirmation
hearings had given him 'valuable time for personal reflection.'
The SEC investigation is understood to involve sales of shares in Cray
Computer, a spin-off of Cray Research, shortly before the company announced
that it had lost a big contract from its principal customer.

<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE VENEZUELAN supreme court ruled yesterday that there is sufficient cause
to try President Carlos Andres Perez for alleged mishandling of government
money.
The court's decision, announced by Chief Justice Gonzalo Rodrguez Corro, is
the first step in a process that may lead to the impeachment and removal
from office of the 70-year-old president.
The ruling came after a long and nagging political crisis that began in
February 1992, when dissident army officers staged an unsuccessful effort to
topple the Perez government.
Announcing the court's decision, the chief justice said that nine of the 15
justices voted for an impeachment trial and six abstained.
Now the 46 members of the Venezuela senate must decide, by majority vote,
whether the president should be impeached. If the vote - which may come
today - goes against Mr Perez, as is expected, he would be suspended from
office and tried by the supreme court. If found guilty, he could not only
lose his job but go to jail.
If the president were to be suspended, his duties would devolve to the
senate chairman, Senator Octavio Lepage.
Mr Perez was preparing last night to deliver a national television address.
He has long maintained his innocence and his intention to fight the
allegations.
His cabinet offered its resignation last night to give him or his successor
a free hand in shaping the administration.
On March 11, Mr Ramon Escovar Salom, Venezuela's attorney-general,
petitioned the supreme court for a decision on whether there was cause to
try the president on charges of fraudulently handling the equivalent of
Dollars 17m in funds from a secret government account used for security and
defence.
Mr Escovar was fired as foreign minister during Mr Perez's first
administration, of 1974-79.
After the court's decision yesterday, small crowds of people in the streets
of Caracas, the capital, cheered and demanded that the president be sent to
jail.
The government had stationed extra police and national guardsmen throughout
the capital city to head off any disturbances.

FT  21 MAY 93 / New face at unsteady helm: Christina Lamb weighs up the
latest Brazilian minister of finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE frequent changes of faces at the helm of Brazil's economy continued
yesterday when Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso was named finance minister in a
cabinet reshuffle.
He is the fourth person in eight months to try his hand at stabilising Latin
America's largest economy and succeeds Mr Eliseu Resende, who lasted a mere
80 days. However, criticisms of President Itamar Franco's inability to
retain ministers were drowned by the positive reaction to Mr Cardoso's
appointment as the best choice in the circumstances.
Mr Mailson da Nobrega, a former finance minister, said: 'Fernando Henrique
has all the qualities needed to improve the situation - he has support in
Congress, is very respected by businessmen, economists and intellectuals,
and he has international prestige.'
In his first interview after being nominated, Mr Cardoso, who is 63, a
Social Democratic party senator and a leading sociologist, said the
president had 'given me liberty to act as I choose, but obviously within the
constraints of the government programme'.
He ruled out the possibility of shock plans to combat inflation: 'We have
had enough of shocks. What we need is confidence and serious and honest hard
work'.
He also said that he intended to reduce interest rates 'gradually and within
market conditions'. He announced that Mr Pedro Malan will continue as chief
debt negotiator and that foreign debt negotiations will not be altered.
Mr Cardoso had been foreign minister since September and won much praise for
his performance. A former professor at the universities of Paris, Geneva,
Mexico and Cambridge, he is the only figure in the Brazilian cabinet who
carries real weight abroad and, despite his left-leaning tendencies, is
thought to be the only person able to secure for Brazil a new accord with
the International Monetary Fund.
The financial markets welcomed the news of Mr Cardoso's appointment, the
main Sao Paulo index rising 4.7 per cent by the lunchtime close. His
considerable influence in Congress will help to pass government legislation
and he is seen as one of the few people who can handle Brazil's
temperamental president. Three finance ministers, two planning ministers and
two central bank governors have toppled during Mr Franco's eight months in
office.
Some foreign investors were dismayed at the idea of yet another change. 'I
have nothing printable to say about Brazil,' said one. Others saw it as more
proof of Mr Franco's mercurial character and are already counting down the
18 remaining months of the Franco administration.
Mr Igor Cornelsen, director of Chartered West LB in Sao Paulo, said: 'The
real problem is the president, not the ministers. I ask to what extent will
Fernando Henrique be able to do anything, or even attract people to work
with him.'
Mr Cardoso's nomination ended the uncertainty of the last fortnight over
allegations that Mr Resende was favouring his former employers, the
Odebrecht construction group, with cheap government finance. He has denied
the allegations and said yesterday the scandal had reduced his ability to
implement the government's economic plan, announced last month.
Mr Resende's departure was part of a wider reshuffle which included the
sacking of the ministers of administration and of agriculture, as well as
the dismissal of the head of Funai, the federal Indian protection agency.
General Romildo Canhim is the new administration minister.
The new appointments are not expected to alter the government's strategy of
stimulating growth through spending and interest rate reduction. Mr Cardoso
was one of the authors of the government's economic plan and is a frequent
adviser to the president.
Mr Cardoso now has to try to bring down inflation from 30 per cent a month
and plug an estimated budget deficit equivalent to Dollars 13bn (Pounds
8.4bn).
Mr da Nobrega said: 'It's a very difficult situation. There is no sign that
inflation will fall and the plan does not tackle the real issues. The most
he can do in the short term is avoid a grave acceleration of inflation.'
In an interview on Wednesday, though, Mr Cardoso was more confident: 'Brazil
is a viable country, the problems are well known and the solutions within
reach.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS leaders in Ontario have expressed dismay at corporate and personal
tax increases imposed by the province's social democrat government in a bid
to reverse its soaring budget deficit.
The New Democratic party's latest provincial budget includes a new minimum
corporate tax, a broadening of the provincial sales tax, and steep increases
in personal tax rates focused on middle- and high-income earners. The top
marginal personal tax rate, combining federal and provincial taxes, will
climb from 49.8 per cent to 52.4 per cent.
The average family's tax burden will increase by CDollars 40-CDollars 80
(Pounds 20-Pounds 40) a month.
Ontario accounts for about 40 per cent of Canada's GDP. A steep rise in its
budget deficit in recent years has made it the biggest non-sovereign
borrower on international capital markets. The province borrowed CDollars
15bn last year, and expects to raise another CDollars 10bn-CDollars 11bn in
the current fiscal year. This will bring total debt to CDollars 79bn.
Mr Floyd Laughren, provincial treasurer, said he aims to bring down the
budget deficit to CDollars 9.2bn in the year to March 31 1994, from CDollars
12bn in 1992-93.

FT  21 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Car makers see 'win-win-win' in Nafta -
Industry disputes the view that the trade pact will benefit Mexico at the
expense of Canada and the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH American vehicle makers dispute the conventional wisdom that the North
American Free Trade Agreement will bring a surge of investment in the
Mexican automotive industry at the expense of US and Canadian plants.
Much more likely, they predict, is a rationalisation and integration of
facilities in all three countries.
'Mexico will get its share of investment,' says Mr Mustafa Mohatarem,
director of economics at General Motors. 'But to the extent that there's
excess capacity in the US and Canada, you're not going to add on capacity in
Mexico, especially in the short term.'
The Mexican car market is growing by about 7 per cent a year. But the
domestic car industry is expected to focus increasingly on the smaller
models most popular with first-time buyers. Mr Mohatarem compares Mexico to
Spain, which, since its accession to the European Community, has become a
hub for small-car production.
While growth in the US and Canadian markets is much slower and likely to
remain so, the car companies are confident that Nafta will also benefit
suppliers in those two countries.
If all goes to plan, Nafta will stimulate trade between Mexico and its two
northern neighbours in much the same way as the 1965 US-Canada automotive
agreement led to a surge in trade between those two countries. The trend
which has seen vehicle and parts makers treat the US and Canada as a single
market for the past three decades is expected to extend gradually to Mexico.
Nafta provides for duty-free trade among the US, Mexico and Canada within 10
years for parts and for vehicles which exceed 62.5 per cent North American
origin. The threshold will rise from the 50 per cent level set by the 1965
US-Canada Autopact, to 56 per cent after five years and to 62.5 per cent.
Nafta will have a tighter definition of North American content than the
Autopact.
At the same time, the local-content and trade-balancing requirements of
Mexico's Automotive Decree will be phased out. The present 1-to-1
'trade-balancing' ratio between exports and imports will drop to 0.55-to-1
after 10 years.
Mexico will cut its local-value-added content requirement immediately from
36 to 34 per cent, and by another one point a year after five years. The
rule will be eliminated entirely after 10 years. The value-added threshold
will only be 20 per cent for sales above those achieved just before the
agreement is implemented.
The Auto Decree forces foreign carmakers to assemble a wide range of
vehicles in Mexico. Although some export-oriented plants are as efficient as
any elsewhere on the continent, those centred on the local market have
relatively small production runs and high costs. Ford's factory in Mexico
City, for instance, turns out eight different models.
Both GM and Ford intend to switch production of larger models now made in
Mexico to under-used plants in the US or Canada. Ford, for instance, will
probably move production of the 10,000 Thunderbirds now assembled each year
in Mexico to an under-used plant in Ohio.
GM sold only 1,805 US-assembled cars in Mexico last year. But the
manufacturers are confident that the new trade-balancing ratios will be
sufficient for their northern plants to compete for virtually the entire
growth in the Mexican market.
GM predicts that the US's automotive trade deficit with Mexico, now running
at about Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) a year, will swing to a 'significant'
surplus.
Nafta's biggest boost to Mexican investment could come from manufacturers
which do not yet have a presence there, but are keen to boost sales of
economy-sized models in a fast-growing market. In particular, industry
observers predict that Honda and Toyota will put up assembly plants in
Mexico within the next few years to complement existing factories in the US
and Canada.
But foreign companies with only one plant in North America are more likely
to pick a site closer to the main US markets than Mexico. BMW recently
announced plans to build a plant in South Carolina. Two other German
carmakers - Mercedes Benz and Audi - are also expected to opt for a US site.
For the time being, transport costs will limit the appeal of investing in
Mexico. Ford cites the example of its compact Escort and Tracer models.
These cars are assembled at two plants in North America: Hermosillo in
north-central Mexico and Wayne, Michigan, on the outskirts of Detroit.
The Mexican factory has a Dollars 30-an-hour advantage in labour costs,
which translates to about Dollars 450 per vehicle. But the further north
cars are shipped from Mexico, the more this advantage is eroded by freight
costs.
Ford finds it economical to ship Mexican-assembled Escorts and Tracers
within an arc covering only about one-third of the southern and south-west
US. The Michigan plant continues to serve the big markets in the north-east
US, as well as the whole of Canada. Its output remains about double that of
Hermosillo.
But differences in transport costs could narrow as Mexico's infrastructure
improves and border procedures are streamlined. Even now, some Canadian
parts suppliers ship to Mexico and vice versa.
The Canadians are confident that - despite frequent complaints about high
wages and taxes - they will continue to attract new investment under
continental free trade. Chrysler, which produces about a third of its North
American vehicles in Ontario, announced earlier this year that it was
boosting capacity at its Bramalea plant outside Toronto.
A boost to US and Canadian parts makers could come from the increase in the
rule-of-origin threshold from 50 per cent to 62.5 per cent. Japanese and
German 'transplants', most of which only just meet the 50 per cent target,
have already begun raising the North American content of their vehicles.
'This formalises a level they were heading for anyway,' says a Canadian
trade negotiator.
The weakness of the US dollar against the yen gives foreign carmakers
another incentive to lower their dependence on imports. But even with the
62.5 per cent threshold, they will be able to source almost all their
high-value electronic, chassis and powertrain components abroad.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Cuban mystery epidemic 'unique' says US expert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A US VIRUS expert helping Cuban doctors to track down the cause of a mystery
nerve disease affecting thousands of Cubans said the epidemic was unique in
his experience.
'After half a day here it's evident that this is a unique epidemic. It's not
like anything that I've ever heard of or seen,' Dr Carleton Gajdusek, the
winner of the 1976 Nobel prize for medicine, said in Havana late on
Wednesday.
He is a specialist in neurological diseases from the US government's
National Institutes of Health and has joined a team of international
specialists helping investigate the epidemic, which has afflicted almost
30,000 people on the Caribbean island.
The Cuban government asked for foreign assistance to deal with the illness
after local doctors had confessed to being baffled by the disease.
The Cubans had first said the disease was optic neuritis, which leads to a
loss of vision and is caused by vitamin deficiency. However, when many of
the victims were also found to be suffering from muscular disorders, the
doctors said they thought the illness was a 'neuropathic epidemic'. Many
victims are left bed-ridden and partly blind, according to Cuban doctors.
Cuban government officials have denied suggestions that the illness is the
result of poor diet and inadequate medicines. Cuba's beleaguered economy has
been suffering shortages of food and medicine. The island's problems have
worsened since a storm in March destroyed many crops.
Health officials are hoping the foreign specialists can quickly determine
the nature of the illness, so a cure can be applied. They said that their
confusion about the nature of the attack is compounded by the fact that its
symptoms are not recorded in medical literature, and that it attacks the
young, old and healthy.
Last month, some officials suggested that the illness was the result of
biological warfare by Cuba's enemies.

ARGENTINA'S trade union congress has attacked the free market policies of
President Carlos Menem and raised the prospect of a general strike, 'when
and where it hurts the government the most,' Reuter reports from Buenos
Aires.
An assembly of 187 union delegates voted late on Wednesday to authorise Mr
Naldo Brunelli, secretary-general of the general labour confederation (CGT),
to decide when the strike would take place.
Such a CGT stoppage would be its second national strike since Mr Menem took
office in July 1989. The first was staged last November 9.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Businessmen in Ontario dismayed at tax increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS leaders in Ontario have expressed dismay at corporate and personal
tax increases imposed by the province's social democrat government in a bid
to reverse its soaring budget deficit.
The New Democratic party's latest provincial budget includes a new minimum
corporate tax, a broadening of the provincial sales tax, and steep increases
in personal tax rates focused on middle and high income earners. The top
marginal personal tax rate, combining federal and provincial taxes, will
climb from 49.8 per cent to 52.4 per cent.
The average family's tax burden will increase by CDollars 40-CDollars 80
(Pounds 20-Pounds 40) a month.
Ontario accounts for about 40 per cent of Canada's GDP. A steep rise in its
budget deficit in recent years has made it the biggest non-sovereign
borrower on international capital markets. The province borrowed CDollars
15bn last year, and expects to raise another CDollars 10bn-CDollars 11bn in
the current fiscal year. This will bring total debt to CDollars 79bn -
double that four years ago.
Mr Floyd Laughren, provincial treasurer, said he aims to bring down the
budget deficit to CDollars 9.2bn in the year to March 31 1994, from CDollars
12bn in 1992-93.
Besides the tax increases, he announced a 4.3 per cent cut in government
operational spending. The government is also in the throes of acrimonious
talks with public sector trade unions over a 'social contract' designed to
cut CDollars 2bn a year from its wage bill.
Burns Fry, a Toronto-based securities firm, yesterday cut its forecast of
Ontario's 1994 growth rate to 3.3 per cent from 4.2 per cent, to reflect the
expected impact of the tax increases on consumer spending. It also warned
that borrowing requirements may be higher than expected.

FT  21 MAY 93 / World Trade News: W Africans hurt by EC beef policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EC SUBSIDIES for beef exports to West Africa are destroying the livelihood
of 4m pastoralists who rely wholly on cattle-rearing in the semi-arid Sahel
region south of the Sahara, according to the British charity Christian Aid.
With other European aid agencies, Christian Aid has launched a campaign for
the abolition of these subsidies.
Since 1984, EC beef exports to West Africa have increased seven-fold,
subsidised to the tune of Pounds 280m by European tax-payers. Local beef
prices have collapsed. The low-quality, subsidised EC beef sells at half the
price of locally produced meat. Sahelian farmers are finding that no-one is
prepared to buy their herds.
EC beef dumping is not only threatening the survival of Sahelian
communities, it also undermines aid from the EC itself to support livestock
production in the Sahel.
Hundreds of millions of Ecus from the European Development Fund have been
spent on building refrigerated abattoirs in Burkina Faso, on improving
cattle breeds in Mali, Gambia and Senegal, and on promoting disease control
in the Ivory Coast and Ghana.
An EC council of ministers meeting is expected to discuss the issue at the
end of the month.
Christian Aid argues that to stop the export of subsidised beef to West
Africa would not seriously damage farmers in Europe. Less than 0.5 per cent
of total EC beef production of 8.7m tonnes in 1991 was exported to the
region.

   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VENEZUELA'S government put thousands of extra police and national guards on
the streets of Caracas yesterday in anticipation of possible violence as the
supreme court debated whether to impeach President Carlos Andres Perez on
corruption charges.
More than 5,000 police, double the usual contingent, were dispatched across
the capital while National Guardsmen flanked the avenue leading up to the
presidential palace.
Security was doubled around the supreme court and oil installations, and the
number of troops at airports was increased. During the day city streets were
virtually empty as many people stayed at home, fearing possible
disturbances.
The supreme court was expected to issue its opinion later yesterday on
whether impeachment procedures should begin against the President for
allegedly mishandling Dollars 17m (Pounds 11m) in government funds.
It would be the first time in Venezuela's 35 years of democracy that a
leader was forced from office. Mr Perez would be suspended from his post
pending the verdict.
In his weekly radio address early yesterday, a confidentMr Perez again
maintained his innocence, arguing that this was merely the latest attempt -
politically motivated - to oust him.
'I know that they want to crush me,' he said. Declining to leave office
until he is forced to, he said: 'Here I am and here I will stay. I await the
decision serenely.'
If the supreme court decides in favour of impeachment, the case must then be
reviewed by the senate, which will have to vote on whether the president
should be tried.
Mr Perez first said he would resign if the supreme court decided against
him, but later asserted he would name one of his government ministers to
serve as acting president.
Mr Perez first held the presidency in 1974-79, a bonanza era when the
country was the second-largest supplier of oil to the US.
But his second term, starting in 1988, has been marked by political and
social unrest in an oil-rich but corrupt country where many live in poverty.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US SENATORS on the powerful finance committee yesterday voiced broad support
for a swift extension of President Bill Clinton's 'fast-track' negotiating
authority in order to finish Uruguay Round negotiations by December 15.
Senator Patrick Moynihan, the committee chairman, promised to introduced the
fast-track measure, unencumbered by conditions, on the Senate floor today.
Fast-track is seen as a necessity for any US administration in trade
negotiations, because it allows a final package to go through the Congress
without amendment.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, yesterday told committee
members that he expects the trade ministers of the US, EC, Canada and Japan
to agree on the broad outline of a tariff reduction package by the time of
the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial powers meet in Tokyo on July.
Although completion of the round by the target date will be 'a tall order',
he said, the four ministers who met in Toronto last week made significant
progress in producing a market access package, particularly in two areas
important to the US - semiconductors and wood products.
The Japanese are now 'engaged' in the process and aware that 'they will have
to take a leadership role'.
By the time the trade ministers meet in Tokyo there will have been 12
ministerial meetings on tariff reduction, Mr Kantor said. 'I remain hopeful
that as the host country for the G7 economic summit meeting, Japan will
demonstrate its commitment to the success of these negotiations.'
He said he would meet the other trade ministers at least twice before the
Tokyo meeting.
Once the four ministers negotiate a tariff package, they will return to the
bargaining table in Geneva to complete two big tasks, Mr Kantor said. The
market access negotiations will be broadened to include goods and services
with the 115 Gatt members participating in the Uruguay Round.
The US will then seek to 'improve' the negotiating text produced by Mr
Arthur Dunkel, the Gatt director-general.
The areas necessary for change include: anti-dumping, subsidies,
trade-related intellectual property rights, environment-related issues on
technical barriers to trade and sanitary measures, subsidies, textiles and
institutional issues, including the establishment of a multilateral trade
organisation.
Mr Kantor also said the Clinton administration would seek to use its
generalised system of preferences, the tariff free programme, designed to
help the developing countries gain markets in the US, as 'an important trade
policy tool'.
Besides conditioning benefits on a government's record on worker rights, it
would also be used it as 'leverage to foster reforms in areas such as
intellectual property'.
The administration has asked for a short-term 15-month extension of the
Dollars 17bn (Pounds 11bn) GSP programme, which expires next July 4. It will
also seek elimination of the statutory ban on GSP for the former Soviet
Union, which prevents Russian and other republics from being considered for
GSP benefits.
'This proposal would allow us to implement President Clinton's commitment to
Russian Federation President Yeltsin,' Mr Kantor said.
Mr Henry Parker III, of the coalition of US service industries, told the
Senate committee that more work must be done to improve the services text.
He said a final agreement should include strong annexes for financial
services and telecommunications and substantial liberalisation across a wide
range of countries and a mechanism to prevent free riders benefiting.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Danes' dismay over riots in Copenhagen: Sympathy for
anti-Maastricht demonstrators is hard to find
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SECOND night of riots in the Norrebro area of Copenhagen, following
Denmark's endorsement of the Maastricht treaty on Tuesday, has left Danes
wondering what has hit their peaceful society.
Further mayhem may be on the way; the demonstrators, associated with a
militant anarchist squatter group known as the BZ'ers, are planning an
official demonstration against the police tomorrow.
However, yesterday's media reports were notably lacking in sociological
soul-searching on the causes of the riots. The Copenhagen popular newspaper
Ekstra Bladet, with a strongly anti-Maastricht readership, described the
riot as 'shameful', 'completely un-Danish', and ascribed the riots to
'louts'.
Copenhagen, one of only two areas in which there was a No majority on
Tuesday, is a city dominated by civil servants and administrators, students,
and the financial service sector. It also has more than its share of social
welfare clients and pensioners.
It has above-average unemployment, about 16 per cent compared with the
national average of 12 per cent. Youth unemployment, however, has been
partly held in check by provision of more places in tertiary education, so
that unemployment in the 16-24 age group is about the same as the national
average.
There was a measure of understanding for the rioters from the June Movement,
the most prominent of the anti-Maastricht campaign movements. One of its
leaders, Ms Drude Dahlerup, declined to condemn Tuesday night's rioters
until she had heard all the facts. But there is no evidence of popular
support for the BZ'ers.
With the city full of journalists and camera crews, the chief worry of many
Danes is the country's 'reputation abroad as a country where you can walk
the streets in safety', as the national newspaper Berlingske Tidende put it.
The second riot was less vicious than the first, when police were under such
severe pressure from the stone-throwing demonstrators that they opened fire
and wounded 11 of them - none seriously. About 26 policemen were also
injured.
Mrs Ebbe Strange, a left-wing member of parliament, has called for an
inquiry into the riot.
On Wednesday night 100-200 demonstrators began smashing shop windows and
were soon involved in a street battle with about 200 police, who used
teargas but did not fire their handguns again. Four police were slightly
injured and four demonstrators arrested, said police.

FT  21 MAY 93 / US sees progress in talks with Kozyrev on Bosnia

<TEXT>
THE US and Russia are 'drawing closer together' on an approach to ending the
ethnic conflict in Bosnia, according to Mr Warren Christopher, the US
secretary of state.
Mr Christopher sounded hopeful after two meetings in Washington yesterday
with Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, who has been pursuing
a Moscow peace initiative. 'We have agreed on a series of matters we might
discuss with our counterparts from France and Britain over the next several
days,' Mr Christopher said.
Mr Kozyrev, who earlier said he saw 'positive results' emerging from the
latest round of talks, said the strategy under discussion was 'very
concrete'. But neither disclosed any details.
Mr Christopher is to meet Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, in
Washington today, and Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, next week.
Ms Dee Dee Myers, White House press secretary, reaffirmed US support for
deploying monitors on the Serbian-Bosnian border to ensure Serbia kept its
promise to stop the flow of arms and other supplies to Bosnian Serbs.
It was thought that the plan to deploy about 500 monitors at dozens of
checkpoints might be voted on by the United Nations Security Council last
night, but the UN postponed a vote.
Ms Myers conceded that the US was not 'comfortable' with the proposal to set
up safe havens for Bosnian Moslems. 'We believe that is a reward for ethnic
cleansing,' she said. But she reiterated support for a war crimes tribunal,
a proposal first advanced by the Bush administration.
Bosnian Croat troops meanwhile freed 1,800 Moslem civilians rounded up
during recent heavy fighting in Mostar, a UN peacekeeping force spokesman
said. But he said there were still some Moslems, apparently Bosnian
government soldiers, detained outside Mostar.
Moslems and Serbs accused each other of launching fresh attacks yesterday in
northern Bosnia and the capital, Sarajevo, a day after the Bosnian Serb
leadership said it had halted military operations.

UKRAINE was plunged into a constitutional crisis yesterday when President
Leonid Kravchuk asked parliament to make him head of government, a position
currently held by the prime minister. In response Prime Minister Leonid
Kuchma offered to resign.
The president's unexpected bid for greater power came as parliament
considered the prime minister's own request, made earlier this week, for an
extended remit in order to implement economic reform. The conservative
parliament had looked set to meet Mr Kuchma's demands, thereby facilitating
greater reform, but the president's proposal could now block that process.
Mr Kuchma this week called on parliament to extend his power to rule the
economy by decree and asked for control over the central bank and state
privatisation body.
Mr Kravchuk had been expected to back the prime minister's plea, but he
surprised deputies yesterday with his request to amend the constitution to
make the president the head of all executive structures in Ukraine. The
presidential option is attractive to deputies because he has promised not to
restrict their authority to pass economic legislation.
Deputies are expected to vote on both the president's and the prime
minister's proposals today. If the president wins, as most predict,
Ukraine's stalled economic reforms could face a further setback.
A senior cabinet minister, who said he would also offer to quit if the prime
minister went, said that if the president took charge of the government he
was likely to bring back the ex-Communist old guard forced out when Mr
Kuchma took office last autumn.
In that event he forecast policies which would to push Ukraine into
hyperinflation within the next six months.
Presidential advisers, however, deny this, saying Mr Kravchuk, who has
carefully side-stepped economic issues during his first 18 months in office,
will pursue radical reforms. 'Mr Kuchma's government said it was
pro-reform,' said one, 'but actually its policies were conservative.'
After a week of rapid reversals, some deputies are advocating a third
option. Mr Volodymyr Iavorivsky urged president and prime minister to work
together, suggesting that Mr Kuchma accept the job of vice-president
responsible for the economy.
However, the prime minister is understood to have rejected such an option.
The political uncertainty is likely to be a setback for the International
Monetary Fund delegation currently in Kiev. It arrived earlier this week to
begin what both sides hoped would be conclusive talks on granting Ukraine
access to the IMF's newly created transitional lending facility.

THE United Nations Security Council is considering a proposal to deploy some
500 international military observers at dozens of checkpoints on the
Yugoslav-Bosnian border to monitor Belgrade's compliance with its promise to
halt arms supplies to Bosnia.
The resolution, sponsored by Russia and EC members Britain, France and
Spain, is also expected to win US backing, albeit unenthusiastic. The US
rift with the Europeans on Balkan policy remains acute.
The secretary general's staff are already making contingency arrangements
for deploying the observers at some 50 checkpoints, although the plan will
have to be presented first to the Council.
Their main task would be to ensure that President Slobodan Milosevic fulfils
his promise to put pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Vance-Owen
peace plan by cutting off vital supplies.
Mr Milosevic has called for a similar international observer team on the
Bosnian-Croatian border to halt arms shipments to the Bosnian Croats. The
resolution asks for recommendations by the secretary general on this
question.
Two other resolutions dealing with the Balkan crisis are also being
considered. One, to establish formally an 11-member international war crimes
tribunal, has run into juridical problems. These were still being ironed out
last night.
The other is a proposal that would have Russian troops join the mainly
western European international force in Bosnia under a plan that would add
about 3,000 soldiers to that operation.
Laura Silber adds from Belgrade: Fresh clashes erupted yesterday in northern
and central Bosnia, in spite of pledges of peace by Serb and Croat leaders.
At least two people were killed and nine wounded in sniper and mortar
attacks on Sarajevo, reported Bosnian radio. Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news
agency, said Grbavica, the Serb-held district of Sarajevo, came under a
heavy mortar attack for the second straight day.

THE European Commission managed to cut its backlog of competition cases by
nearly a third last year.
The Brussels authorities have been heavily criticised by lawyers and
companies for the time it takes to examine routine deals under EC treaty
rules which outlaw cartels and abuses of a dominant position.
The Commission's annual report on competition reveals that 1,562 such cases
were still being examined on December 31 1992, compared with 2,287 a year
earlier. Some 399 new cases were taken on during the year, compared with 388
in 1991. Since 1988, there has been a 55 per cent reduction in the backlog,
as the Commission has tried to accelerate internal procedures.
Brussels already applies strict deadlines to merger cases, but the
competition directorate says it is not yet possible to introduce internally
binding deadlines for the bulk of general cases.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Russia sets tough debt terms

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA is demanding repayment on harsh terms of the trillions of roubles it
is owed by the other former Soviet republics. Members of the Commonwealth of
Independent States, they are ostensibly committed to establishing a closer
economic union.
In talks with the states, Russia has demanded:
that repayment must start from 1994;
that the interest rate on the debt must be paid at 2 per cent above the
prevailing interbank rate;
that the repayments be denominated in dollars at a rate pegged to that
prevailing in the middle of last year, when the rouble was much stronger
against the dollar.
Western advisers following these negotiations say the terms are
exceptionally tough - especially as Russia has benefited from a five-year
postponement on payment of interest and capital on its Dollars 80bn-plus
debt with the London and Paris clubs. However, they are also seen as an
opening gambit, albeit one showing Russia is no longer willing or able to
deal with its neighbours on any other than commercial terms.
Most of the debt is in the form of technical credits advanced over recent
years which have allowed the republics to keep on buying Russian energy and
manufactured goods. Russia's dominance as an energy producer has meant it is
the creditor country in nearly all bilateral relationships with other CIS
members.
However, the debtor countries are in most cases even more impoverished than
Russia, with much less possibility than Russia of earning hard currency
through energy or other sales. Their continuing need for Russian credits is
illustrated by the intention of the Ukrainian government to seek a further
Rbs1,000bn credit line with which to pay for Russian oil and gas this year.
Russia's potential to earn hard currency this year and next has been further
damaged by the continuing fall in oil output.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Serbs confident they can end war and keep spoils: Why the
world community is being defied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIAN Serb leaders have triumphantly declared peace, presenting the
outside world with the fait accompli of their self-styled state and
challenging the west to come up with new peace proposals to replace the
Vance-Owen plan, acceptable to the Bosnian Serbs.
Despite rifts between Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and his
Belgrade patrons, Serb leaders on both sides of the frontier appear to
believe that the war is over. Their apparent differences are about tactics
to achieve their objectives.
In the aftermath of the overwhelming rejection by Bosnian Serbs of the
Vance-Owen plan in their referendum last week-end, it is significant that
Belgrade has toned down its criticisms of Bosnian Serb leaders.
Mr Karadzic is now confident that the west will not intervene against
Bosnian Serb targets. He is clearly buoyed by the rumblings of the rift
between the US and its European allies over how to handle the crisis, and
has even said the Clinton administration would soon publicly back Serbian
'rights' and the 'autonomy of our state'.
The Bosnian Serb assembly's announcement on Wednesday that Bosnian Serb
forces would cease all military operations in Bosnia comes at a time when
they already control 70 per cent of Bosnian territory, compared with the 43
per cent allocated to them under the Vance-Owen plan. The remark by a
prominent Bosnian Serb intellectual that 'the remaining (Moslem) enclaves
will fall like ripe fruit from the trees' is indicative of the widespread
feeling of confidence among the Serbs of Bosnia.
In their efforts to carve out a Serbian state, Republika Srpska, Bosnian
Serbs have expelled or killed hundreds of thousands of Moslems. 'The
decision has been made. The Serbian people never again - not under any
conditions - will give up Republika Srpska and the whole world must know
this,' Mr Karadzic told the Bosnian Serb assembly.
Anxious to persuade the UN to ease sanctions against the remnants of
Yugoslavia, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Serbian president, has endorsed the
international plan to divide Bosnia into ten provinces. But he is clearly
aware that re-invention of multi-ethnic Bosnia will prove elusive for a
fractious international community.
If Belgrade has backed the step-by-step implementation of the Vance-Owen
peace plan, it has done so on the assumption that it would give time for
'necessary corrections' to be made. In practice, this can only mean
territorial concessions to the Bosnian Serbs.
Mr Karadzic set out his thoughts on the subject with brutal clarity on
Wednesday. A Bosnian Serb state would be willing to settle for a
confederation with the Croats and Moslems in Bosnia-Hercegovina, 'if it
makes the job of the international community easier, and if they want to
preserve Bosnia-Hercegovina in some form.'
Serbian power-brokers have echoed Mr Karadzic's call for peace. Even more
telling are the similar statements this week by President Franjo Tudjman of
Croatia. Serb and Croat leaders have long sought to carve up Bosnia at the
expense of the Moslems, the republic's biggest ethnic group.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Spanish Elections: Parties set to pay homage to Catalonia -
Catalan nationalist leader Jordi Pujol could hold the balance of power after
June 6
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE one political party that is wholly confident about Spain's June 6
general elections is Catalonia's nationalist grouping Convergencia i Unio,
CiU. Its electoral slogan proclaims the poll date to be 'The Great
Opportunity' and nobody disputes the relevance of the message.
The ruling Socialist party, PSOE, and the centre-right Partido Popular
opposition, PP, are worried. The two Madrid-based parties are evenly matched
and they both know that neither of them is likely to form a governing
majority.
The prospect of a stand-off election and a hung parliament is tailor-made
for CiU's ambition to consolidate its hold on the wealthy north-east corner
of Spain.
CiU has consistently won Catalonia's regional elections - its leader, Mr
Jordi Pujol, has run the autonomous government, the Generalitat, since 1980
 -and it is now also poised to outstrip the Socialists in Catalonia in a
general election.
Opinion polls indicate that CiU could gain up to three seats, to return 21
of the 47 members elected in Catalonia to the Madrid congress, that the
PSOE's present 22 Catalan seats will be sharply reduced, possibly to as few
as 15, and that the PP may double its Catalan representation to 10 seats.
On present evidence neither the Socialists nor the centre-right opposition
are likely to gain much more than 150 seats in the 350-member Congress and
the CiU's 20-odd members will hold the balance of power in the new
legislature. Mr Pujol can accordingly negotiate an alliance with the PSOE
and return it to power for a fourth term, or he could ally with the PP and
usher in a new government. Mr Pujol, who clearly relishes the prospect of a
power-broker role, says CiU can be counted on to assure the governability of
Spain. But he is keeping understandably quiet about which of the two main
parties he is willing to back.
The choice is not an easy one, for CiU is a middle-of-the- road party that
seeks to be all things to all Catalans. It embraces diehard and lukewarm
nationalists, big business, small shopkeepers and liberal-minded
professionals.
An alliance with the PSOE would anger Mr Pujol's middle-class supporters but
one with the PP would upset Catalan nationalist sentiment.
It is not, however, a choice that can be ducked. 'Since we have the
responsibility of governing Catalonia, we are condemned to reaching an
understanding with Madrid,' says Mr Joaquin Molins, a former member of Mr
Pujol's Generalitat government who is now running for a CiU seat in
Congress. Tipped for a cabinet post in the event of a coalition government,
Mr Molins stresses that it is very much in Catalonia's self-interest for
Spain to have a competent and stable government.
Catalonia resembles northern Italy in its sophisticated development.
However, unlike regional political movements there, such as the Lombard
League, which have little time for the rest of Italy, CiU cannot dissociate
itself from its Spanish framework.
Catalonia is only geographically close to the core of Europe; its prosperity
is to a large extent dependent on the purchasing power of the more backward
areas of the domestic economy.
La Gran Oportunitat, as CiU's electoral posters proclaim, is the challenge
to infuse the Spanish administration, as junior partners in a coalition led
either by the PSOE or the PP, with all the values and virtues of modernity,
efficiency and commercial acumen that are attributed to the Catalans. The
slogan echoes a call to 'Catalanise Spain' made 60 years ago by the
financier Mr Francesc Cambo, the father of modern Catalan nationalism.
But it is also an opportunity to increase the considerable self-rule powers
that are already enjoyed by Barcelona's Generalitat. Mr Pujol will insist on
the Generalitat's fiscal co-responsibility in Catalonia with the Madrid
government as the price for CiU support in a national coalition government.
Eventually Mr Pujol wants the Generalitat to raises its own taxes and then
pay a lump sum to Madrid for the services rendered by the central
administration. The Basque country and Navarre, its adjoining autonomous
community, already have this prerogative. 'All we want is the same deal,'
says Mr Molins.
It is doubtful, given the electoral trends, whether either the PSOE or the
PP will be in a position to reject such a deal after June 6.
MR JORDI PUJOL is fast and fluent, although not always understandable, in
English, French, German and Italian as well as Spanish, writes Tom Burns in
Barcelona. As a public speaker he is at his most impressive speaking
Catalan, the language he considers his birthright and that of Catalonia's
6m-odd inhabitants.
Aged 63, Mr Pujol has been running the area that he resolutely calls a nacio
since 1980 as chief minister of the Generalitat, the Barcelona-based
autonomous government. As well as the most linguistically gifted of Spain's
senior politicians, he is the longest serving in high elected office.
Mr Pujol has been a passionate Catalan patriot since his student days, when
he was tortured and imprisoned for singing Catalonia's national anthem at a
Barcelona concert attended by the top brass of General Franco's
dictatorship.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Spanish Elections: Basques and Catalans plan own 'central'
banks
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S TWO big governing regional parties, the Basque PNV and the Catalan
CiU, have both issued a serious threat to the central authority of Madrid
before the June 6 election by announcing plans to set up public banks which
could increase the financial autonomy of the two regions.
The move, started by the Basques and quickly followed by the Catalans, is a
taste of the complex political dilemma that could confront either of Spain's
two main parties, the governing Socialists or the conservative Partido
Popular (PP), after the election.
These parties are neck-and-neck in the polls, which predict a hung
parliament in which any government would have to have the assistance of the
Basque and Catalan parties. By launching their proposals now, the Basques
and Catalans are making clear the price of such co-operation.
The PNV has said its planned public bank for the Basque country would enjoy
the same powers as the Bank of Spain in obliging Basque financial
institutions, mainly savings banks, to deposit with it a proportion of their
deposits, interest free, to meet liquidity requirements.
A draft law publish by the Basque government says the new bank, the
Euskadiko Banku Publikoa, would serve to 'obtain the maximum financial
autonomy for Euskadi' (the Basque country).
The possibility of creating a Basque central bank has been raised before and
it is believed that, ultimately, the PNV intends the new bank to be a
central bank issuing its own currency. The Basque country already has a
statute of autonomy, allowing the regional government the exclusive right to
collect and distribute taxes.
Responding to publication of the Basque draft law, the CiU leader and
Catalan premier, Mr Jordi Pujol, emerged from a cabinet meeting this week
saying: 'We must do it too.' The Catalans, who do not yet collect their own
taxes, want a public bank run by the regional government which would be used
to help fund regional government projects.
It is taken for granted, however, that the Catalans, sooner or later, would
also want this bank to take some control over Catalonia's financial sector,
and that it would also begin to set liquidity requirements for local banking
institutions.

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CHASTENED Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, is set to stay on
in Bonn to wrestle with the budgetary headaches of German unification, after
he failed in an attempt to take over as prime minister in his home state of
Bavaria.
The man now regarded as odds-on favourite for the Bavarian job is Mr Edmund
Stoiber, the conservative interior minister in the Bavarian government and a
close confidant of the late Franz-Josef Strauss, the longest-serving
post-war Bavarian premier.
The solution, to be presented to a meeting of the party leadership of the
Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU) today, is good news for
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. He will not have to find a new man to fill the
unpopular job of finance minister at a time of acute budget stringency, and
in the run-up to a whole series of state and national elections.
It amounts to a serious setback, however, for the political ambitions of Mr
Waigel, who had clearly set his heart on the state premier's job in Munich.
He now knows that in his home base, he cannot match the support of Mr
Stoiber, the hard man of the CSU and now seen as a certain future party
leader.
The planned compromise will leave Mr Waigel as party leader in the CSU, with
his position ostensibly enhanced, provided he remains in Bonn. There he has
always shown himself to be a loyal and likeable lieutenant to Mr Kohl in the
ruling coalition. As far as Bavarians are concerned, he may have been too
easy to accommodate, unlike the prickly Mr Strauss before him.
An important factor in the outcome is the decision of CSU party barons on
who can best resist the advance of the far-right Republican party in next
year's state, national and European elections. Mr Stoiber, who has taken a
strong anti-immigration and tough law-and-order stance, is seen to be the
obvious local leader. Mr Waigel's problem is that the Bonn Finance Ministry
is a poisoned political chalice - above all at such a time of almost
permanent budget cutting.
Only on Wednesday, Mr Kohl served notice that another ferocious round of
savings was needed to keep the 1994 budget under control. Tax revenues are
estimated to fall more than DM100bn (Pounds 40.6bn) short of the original
forecast up to 1996, because of the current recession and rising
unemployment.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Italian interest rate cut to 10.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Italy yesterday cut the discount rate by half a percentage point
to 10.5 per cent, the lowest level since 1978, Robert Graham writes.
The move followed the positive outcome of the second Danish referendum on
the Maastricht treaty and is in response to calls from recession-hit
industries to ease the still high cost of borrowing.
Commercial banks immediately began to bring their prime rates into line. On
average the commercial banks looked set to cut their prime rates by half a
percentage point to 11.75 per cent.
The fall in interest rates, reflected in the reduced cost of financing the
budget deficit, brought some relief to the Ciampi government as the economic
team finalised measures for a mini-budget.
This could be announced today with a mix of new taxes and spending cuts
which are aimed at producing an extra L13,000bn (Pounds 5.5bn).
The bulk is expected to come from higher taxes, specially on petrol.

<TEXT>
ITALY'S 100-year-old Socialist party was in danger of disintegration last
night after Mr Giorgio Benvenuto announced his resignation as leader after
only 97 days.
His resignation, so close to municipal elections next month, is expected to
accelerate the formation of new political alliances as the traditional
parties struggle to find fresh identities untainted by the corruption
scandals.
Mr Benvenuto made it clear he was quitting because the old guard in the
party, faithful to Mr Bettino Craxi, the former leader, had undermined every
attempt to introduce reforms. But the state of the party's finances, with
accumulated debts close to L300bn (Pounds 128m), played a part.
On May 4, he had threatened to resign reforms were not adopted.
Yesterday he commented bitterly: 'Today the chances of me remaining as
leader have vanished. I have realised that every residual effort to save the
party is immediately blocked by counter-proposals from a sizeable section of
those who until recently were in the leadership.'
Mr Benvenuto's decision is also linked to a special report prepared by a
consulting firm on the state of the party's finances. This report revealed
documented debts attributable directly to the party of L214bn. The figure is
close to L300bn if the debts and losses of the party's daily newspaper,
Avennire are included.
Previously Mr Benvenuto had suspected debts were about L160bn, but even that
was double what he had been led to believe three months ago. Bank debts and
interest charges are likely to force the party to make some quick sales of
its large property portfolio. Mr Benvenuto has never received any pay for
his job and the 240 staff in the Rome headquarters have not been paid for
three months.
The parlous state of the party's finances, Mr Benvenuto claims, reflected
very lax management. The Socialist party has been revealed by the corruption
scandal as the party with the biggest appetite for money yet its debts are
nearly triple those of any other political grouping.
At least six members of the Socialist executive decided to resign along with
Mr Benvenuto, including Mr Gino Giugni, the party chairman.
Mr Benvenuto is the former leader of the UIL, the Socialist-controlled trade
union confederation. He was brought in as a compromise candidate in February
to replace Mr Craxi, disgraced in corruption scandals.
Despite being forced to step down, Mr Craxi still sought to control the
party through his allies on the executive such as Mr Gianni De Michaelis,
the former foreign minister. Mr Craxi himself retained offices in the party
headquarters in Rome.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Saarland steelworks 'victim of EC failure'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
AN ABANDONED steel plant, corroded by rust, lies next door to Saarstahl, the
near-bankrupt steelmaker in depressed German Saarland.
Workers have nicknamed the sprawling structure, once the jewel of the now
defunct steel group Rochling, the 'museum'. But as closure looms at
Saarstahl itself, they say the whole area will soon be more like a
mausoleum.
Saarstahl, the French-owned steel producer employing 7,500 workers, filed
for protection from its creditors this week. Usinor-Sacilor, which owns 70
per cent of the holding, said it could no longer sustain losses of DM30m
(Pounds 12m) a month.
For workers, trade union and Saarland state officials alike, Saarstahl is
the victim of the European Community's inability to devise a coherent steel
policy.
'Why is the plug being pulled on us when other steel groups in Europe get
free doses of oxygen in the form of state subsidies?' Mr Werner Fries, an
official at the plant's workers' council, asked angrily.
But other German steel makers, equally quick to accuse Brussels, have
watched as Saarstahl and Klockner-Werke, a steel producer with its
headquarters in the Ruhr valley, filed for protection from creditors. The
steelmakers fear their rivals will be able to come back fit and trim and
attractive to foreign buyers.
Klockner-Werke recently filed for a 'composition' procedure, a legal step
short of outright bankruptcy. The move should allow the ailing steel maker
to write-off DM1.4bn of its DM2.7bn net debt. For Saarstahl, the proceedings
will allow it to suspend interest payments on its debt. Its payroll will be
covered by funds from the federal labour office. Saarland state officials
said the company's liquidity crisis would be at least temporarily resolved.
Thyssen, Germany's largest steel group, complained that susbsidies could not
be pumped indefinitely into ailing steelmakers. Allowing both Saarstahl and
Klockner-Werke to go on, freed from their debt burden, would lead to a 'a
drastic distortion of competition in Germany and Europe, with negative
consequences for the rest of the steel industry,' the company said.
The closure of Saarstahl, which produced 2.2m tonnes of long products in
1992, threatens 7,500 jobs. Long products, such as rods, wires and steel
sections, have been hit hardest by cheaper imports from eastern Europe.
A total rescue mission for Saarstahl is now ruled out, however. But the
company has four or five mills which operate competitively as a result of
heavy investments made in the last decade, according to Mr Lothar Kramm, the
official responsible for steel in Saarland's state government.
Already the most subsidised steel maker in Germany, it will not receive
additional funds from the federal budget, however. Pointing to some DM3.7bn
received in direct subsidies, soft loans and credit guarantees since 1978,
when the company first ran into difficulties, the federal economic ministry
has turned a deaf ear to calls for fresh money.
For the state Social Democratic government, keeping Saarstahl alive is
vital. Its fate may indeed be tied to the ailing steel giant. Promises to
keep it alive are on the top of the electoral agenda of Mr Oskar Lafontaine,
the state premier, who in 1985 came to power after 25 years of conservative
rule.
Saarstahl workers believe their state government will rescue the steelmaker
from total collapse, as it did when the company was bought back from Arbed
of Luxembourg for a notional DM2 in 1986.
They say the blame lies with Usinor-Sacilor, which, according to Mr Fries of
the workers' union, refused pleas for a new capital injection made by the
state government, which owns a 27.5 per cent stake.
'Steel is all politics,' said Mr Fries, suggesting that job losses mattered
less to the French than to the Saarland government. The state already has
the second-highest unemployment rate in western Germany after Bremen, home
of the Klockner-Werke plants.
But then, Saarland's ambiguous relations with France are historical, Mr
Fries added. Saarland voted twice, in 1935 and 1955, to be re-attached to
Germany after falling under French administration at the end of both world
wars.
'But maybe, if we were French steel workers, we would have kept our jobs,'
said one of the plant's workers.

THE Greek parliament began setting up a powerful committee yesterday to
investigate charges that leaders of the ruling conservative party illegally
bugged their political opponents, Reuter reports from Athens.
Party leaders began selecting those who will sit on the 35-member committee
to inquire into allegations that the ruling New Democracy party
systematically eavesdropped on an array of rivals during a political crisis
from 1988 to 1990. They also plan measures to control bugging.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Yes means Nein for D-Mark: Danish vote raises fears over
German currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK'S vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty has given a boost to the
project of European union. But dealers in financial markets wonder whether
the Danish Yes has also signalled the start of a long-term decline for the
mighty D-Mark on the foreign exchanges.
Over the last 12 months, the German currency benefited greatly from the
turmoil in the European exchange rate mechanism, as currency and bond
dealers sought a source of stability.
But as Maastricht gets back on track, there are signs that dealers are
regaining confidence in currencies and bonds outside the D-Mark bloc. This
process threatens to lift the veil on fundamental weaknesses in Germany's
economy and its public finances.
'The poor fundamentals underpinning the German currency are becoming
gradually exposed,' says Mr Avinash Persaud, of UBS. 'I anticipate the
D-Mark will soon be one of the weakest of the major currencies.'
This week, the Danish vote has already triggered a sharp outflow of 'hot
money' from the D-Mark into other European currencies and bonds.
In recent months, international investors had bought the D-Mark as a means
of hedging against the possibility of further devaluations of currencies
like the Danish krone, the peseta and the escudo.
But the last three days have witnessed a one-off flow of funds out of the
D-Mark, lifting sterling, the Italian lira and the Iberian currencies, while
weakening the D-Mark and German government bonds.
Simultaneously, there has been a surge of short-term investment in the
dollar, following US consumer inflation figures that show a 3.7 per cent
rise in the first three months of this year, from just 3 per cent in the
previous quarter.
Some dollar investors believe the data may have given the Federal Reserve's
open market committee, which met this week, a reason to raise short-term US
interest rates - a move that would increase the premium on short-term dollar
holdings.
Initially, the developments in Denmark and the US may only affect flows of
hot money between the main currencies. But several longer-term factors are
forcing institutional investors to ponder the weighting of D-Marks in their
currency and bond portfolios.
The increase in Germany's current account and budget deficits, as a result
of the reunification of East and West Germany, has raised fears about a
build-up of D-Mark denominated paper on the world's bond markets. For 1993,
the federal deficit forecast has risen from DM43bn (Pounds 17.4bn) to
DM70bn. But this figure still appears implausible to many analysts.
Mr Jonathan Hoffman, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston, says that
the settlement of the IG Metall strike may worsen the budget deficit, as
East German metalworkers were guaranteed that their wages would grow to 80
per cent of those for their western counterparts, in spite of their much
lower productivity. 'That was a political settlement, and not the one the
markets wanted to see,' he said.
With German GDP set to fall by about 2 per cent this year, the Bundesbank is
also likely to reduce short-term interest rates further, thus reducing the
premium for investors holding D-Marks.
It is also in the interest of the government and central banks to pull down
short-term rates as quickly as possible in order to alleviate the funding
burden and attract investment into longer-dated bonds.
Following the five realignments since last autumn, the D-Mark is the one
currency in the ERM that remains significantly over-valued. It is thought to
be 20 per cent over-valued on a purchasing power parity basis: this will
have to be redressed if the country is to maintain its share of export
markets. Amid all these factors, the near-term outlook for the D-Mark
depends on how the Bundesbank responds.
Several Bundesbank council members have raised concern that a weakening
D-Mark would raise the prospect of imported inflation.
But Mr Steve Hannah, a director of IBJ International, believes that it will
be difficult for the Bundesbank to respond to this danger by tightening
monetary policy.
'If the D-Mark falls independently of German interest rate cuts, the
Bundesbank might have to slow its easing of monetary policy to keep the
D-Mark strong, worsening the recession,' he said. The Bundesbank's hope must
be that, as interest rates come down, there is an orderly depreciation in
the D-Mark. But the long term outlook for the D-Mark remains far from
certain.
The D-Mark remains an important reserve currency of European central banks
and the proportion of foreign exchange turnover in D-Marks has increased in
recent years.
But a parallel is often drawn these days between the D-Mark's current
situation and the way in which the dollar's status as a reserve currency has
been gently eroded in the last 30 years by the build up of America's trade
and budget deficits.
'I wonder whether, two or three years after reunification, the same
phenomenon is beginning to affect the D-Mark,' says Mr Hannah. 'The
atmosphere is certainly changing, and the relative strength of the D-Mark
will be a talking point for some time to come.'

FT  21 MAY 93 / Jobless fall boosts economic optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, IVOR OWEN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER unexpected drop in unemployment and a marked slowdown in earnings
growth yesterday revived hopes that the UK economy is continuing to recover
with inflation under control.
The figures prompted a strong rise in sterling, which closed in London 3/4
of a pfennig up on the day at DM2.51, a four-month high. It rose further in
New York to DM2.5153.
The monthly fall in unemployment - the third in a row - helped offset doubts
about the strength of the recovery that arose earlier this week when
official figures showed falls in retail sales and manufacturing output.
The number of people out of work and claiming benefit shrank by 1,400 last
month to 2,939,600, or 10.5 per cent of the workforce. The drop followed
falls of 25,500 and 25,800 in February and March respectively and took the
unemployment total to its lowest level for five months.
Optimism about the UK's economic prospects was boosted further by news that
average earnings growth hit a 25-year low in the year to March, on the
strength of lower pay settlements. The subdued earnings growth also
reflected sharp pay increases in March 1992, when some bonuses and salaries
were paid ahead of the general election to avoid higher taxes under a
possible Labour government.
But a 45,000 rise in the number of people out of work for more than a year
in the first quarter, acted as a reminder of the economy's fragility. At
1.07m, long-term unemployment was 234,000 higher than in the first quarter
of 1992.
The latest figures from the Department of Employment did little to end the
confusion over the trend in unemployment. Some City economists said a strong
rise in manufacturing employment for the third consecutive month meant the
drop in unemployment was more than just a statistical 'artefact'.
Manufacturing employment rose by 5,000 in March, the third consecutive
monthly rise, following revisions for January and February.
But Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow employment secretary, reiterated his
accusation that the figures had been 'fiddled'. He said the government had
restricted eligibility for claiming unemployment benefit. Mrs Gillian
Shephard, backed by officials from the Employment Service, said the
accusation was 'fabricated' and said her department had used the same method
of calculating the number of unemployed since 1981.
The unemployment figures diminished expectations of another cut in interest
rates. The FT-SE 100 index of leading industrial shares closed down 2.9
points on the day at 2,816.8.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Tory unease at scale of possible spending cuts: Parents may
face university fees - Restrictions considered on benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT faced the threat of a backlash from its own supporters
yesterday as it became increasingly clear that the scale of spending cuts
under consideration could lead to significant inroads into the welfare
state.
Among controversial moves being considered in the spending review now under
way are understood to be the charging of parents for university tuition fees
and restricting the availability of benefits which are not protected by
election pledges.
A change to the existing system under which university tuition fees are
automatically paid by the government would seriously hurt the pockets of
middle-class parents. Typical tuition fees would be just less than Pounds
2,000 a year for arts subjects, and Pounds 2,770 for science.
Government spending on fees in higher education is expected to rise from
just under Pounds 600m in 1990-91 to Pounds 1.6bn in 1993-94.
The scale of a possible backlash from Tory backbenchers already worried by
the government's recent series of political setbacks will depend on how far
the spending cuts affect key groups of Conservative supporters among the
middle classes and pensioners.
The need for a by-election in Christchurch, which has been a rock solid Tory
seat and which contains a large proportion of pensioners, will ensure that
the impact of the spending review on the elderly remains a high-profile
issue.
Mr John Major, prime minister, yesterday confirmed that the review would
look at state benefits but promised that the government would honour its
manifesto commitments, and that the 'most vulnerable' people would be
protected.
Some Tory MPs, however, were quick to insist that pensioners and those just
above income support levels should not suffer.
The prime minister's attempts to seize on the encouraging unemployment
figures and the completion of the Maastricht bill by the House of Commons,
were overshadowed at Westminster by the row over the prospect of ending free
prescriptions for all but the poor.
In noisy scenes in the Commons yesterday afternoon, Mr Major emphasised that
no decisions on next year's spending had been made and that none was
imminent.
While there was support at a meeting last night of the 1922 committee of
Tory backbenchers for Mr Major's insistence that nothing could be ruled out
of the spending review, there was also concern among Conservative MPs that
extending prescription charges would be just the first of many unpopular
options to be canvassed in coming weeks. One MP suggested that the
government appeared to have 'a death wish'.
The anxiety was reinforced by Mr Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief
secretary, who said prescription charges were 'only one of 100 different
things to look at'. The entire Pounds 80bn social security budget was 'a
cuckoo in the nest', he said.
Targetting benefits, Mr Portillo added, must be one line of inquiry in the
review. 'The whole point of this is to make sure that our public spending
goes to the people who need it most, and produces the best possible
benefit,' he said.
Against the prospect of difficult spending decisions, cabinet ministers held
a special political discussion yesterday morning to discuss how they could
present the government's case more compellingly.
Labour, however, is determined to press home its attack. Mr John Smith, the
party leader, said he could not imagine 'a more gross betrayal' of the
Tories' election commitments than cutting back free prescriptions. Mr Major
accused him of 'scaremongering'.
The cabinet is expected to discuss public spending in June, but meetings
between Mr Portillo and spending ministers have been going on for the past
month or so.
Some ministers are already warning that the decision not to press ahead more
vigorously with paying benefits through automated credit transfer rather
than through post offices - a retreat earlier this week in response to Tory
concern about rural sub-post offices - would mean that more savings would
have to be made in the benefits themselves.
'You can't spend the same money twice. What you spend on administration you
can't spend on benefits,' one minister said yesterday.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Radical EC job creation plan close to conclusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is close to concluding radical plans to tackle
Europe's growing unemployment crisis, including the possibility of member
states adjusting tax and social security policies to create jobs.
The plan, expected to be agreed by the Commission next Wednesday, is likely
to be the centrepiece of the European Community's increasingly urgent
efforts to demonstrate their search for solutions to unemployment.
The central idea is to find ways of stimulating a more labour-intensive
pattern of economic growth. According to senior officials, the plan, which
is still being refined, will draw on experience in the US and Japan where
much higher percentages of the workforce are employed.
Officials in Brussels say a recovery in growth will not be enough to deal
with EC unemployment levels now at 17.4m, or 10.3 per cent, more than half
of which is structural rather than cyclical, or to combat under-employment.
'If we don't come up with something on this we'll be in serious trouble,'
one said, though he cautioned that 'we are not claiming to do more than we
can deliver'. He said measures at national level would be decisive.
Following its expected approval on May 26, it will then be discussed by
labour and social affairs ministers on June 1 in Luxembourg, with the
intention of sending recommendations to the Copenhagen summit of EC heads of
government on June 21-22.
Officials say the intention is to develop the strategy over the next 18
months, in collaboration with national governments, which would need to
decide what measures to take. It is intended that all EC councils whose work
affects jobs, ranging from finance to environment ministers, contribute to
the strategy.
The focus of the strategy is likely to be on:
Tax and social security changes. 'We must see what can be done to shift
charges away from employment costs,' one senior official says, adding that
in many EC countries a heavy tax and social security burden for employers
inhibits job creation.
Changes in working time designed to promote more sharing out of employment
opportunities. Officials argue that in the US, where around 75 per cent of
the potential workforce is employed against nearer 60 per cent in the EC,
household incomes have risen through work-sharing, even though income per
head has remained roughly static.
A review of national welfare and unemployment benefit systems to eliminate
disincentives to work. Officials say the emphasis is likely to be on
increasing and co-ordinating spending on 'active' manpower measures, like
training, retraining and job counselling. At present, only 0.8 per cent of
EC gross domestic product, out of a total unemployment benefits bill of
nearly 2.3 per cent of GDP, is spent on active measures.
Already member states are saying they want to be closely involved in
different parts of the strategy.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Maastricht mayhem ends as bill clears Commons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN last night took a big step towards ratifying Maastricht when MPs
ended a year-long House of Commons battle and voted by a wide margin to give
the bill implementing the treaty its decisive third reading.
In an atmosphere verging on anti-climax, MPs delivered their verdict after
more than 200 hours of often rancorous debate spread over exactly a year.
After months of Commons' mayhem and manoeuvring, the bill now moves to the
Lords where Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit lie in wait to spearhead fresh
attempts to force a British referendum on the treaty.
The former prime minister and the former Tory chairman are expected to
marshal a noisy and no-holds-barred campaign. But ministers are confident
the bill will clear all its parliamentary hurdles by late July and be sent
for Royal Assent shortly afterwards.
In a final act of defiance, a total of 41 Conservatives and 65 Labour
Euro-sceptics last night voted against the bill, which was carried by a
margin of 180 votes (292 to 112). A further five Tories joined Labour in
abstaining.
After the vote, a gaggle of Tory Euro-sceptics were ironically among the few
MPs to show any signs of elation, taking comfort from the number of
Conservatives who had defied the whips. 'We are delighted with these figures
 -they will make the government approach other European bills as though they
were walking on eggshells,' said one.
After this week's Danish Yes vote, Britain is likely to be the last of the
member states to ratify the treaty. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary,
yesterday warned of 'lasting damage to British interests' if the UK now
destroyed it.
The prevalent emotion throughout a strangely subdued day at Westminster was
one of relief at finally seeing the back of the most minutely scrutinised
piece of legislation in years.
The anti-climactic note was most apparent as chancellor Mr Norman Lamont
delivered the final speech. But this stemmed less from the chancellor's
remarks than the largely vacant opposition benches.
Though Labour MPs were under no obligation to attend after the front bench's
decision to abstain, the suspicion was that the competing attraction of the
FA Cup final replay played a part in the sparse attendance.
The foreign secretary had been in playful mood, mocking Labour for deciding
to abstain in last night's vote after MPs had sifted 600 amendments.
He brought the House down with the claim, attributed to an unnamed EC
foreign minister, that '40 per cent of the intellectual content of the
Community today owed its origin to Lady Thatcher'.
The highlight of a speech by Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary,
came when he brandished a scrap of paper more than half covered in
lime-green marker pen. This turned out to be the text of the Maastricht
bill. The bits in green were the parts included as a result of Labour
proposals.
Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister who took Britain into the EC in
1973, was in magisterial form, criticising Mr Hurd for being 'out of date'
and Labour for being the only left-of-centre party in the EC not to have
voted to support the treaty.
The Maastricht bill began its Commons passage a year ago when MPs gave it a
second reading with a majority of 244. But within days the Danes voted
narrowly No in their first referendum on the treaty.
The upshot at Westminster was a sustained period of backstage manoeuvring,
with the Labour front bench trying to force Maastricht's social chapter on
the government without derailing the treaty and Euro-sceptics on both sides
of the House striving to destroy it.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Plan to seize BR assets abandoned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday abandoned its controversial plan to seize a portion
of British Rail's pension fund assets after privatisation in the face of
opposition from trustees, employees and the Conservative party's own
backbenchers.
Instead, the roughly Pounds 8.5bn in pension fund assets will be used to
create a joint industry scheme in which all current employees may
participate as long as they remain in the rail industry. A portion of those
assets will be set aside in a separate pool to pay benefits to present and
deferred pensioners.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, insisted yesterday that the decision
was not a U-turn. 'There can be no question of a U-turn as this is a
decision being taken for the first time,' he said. The move should not be
viewed as a blueprint for the future of the pension schemes of other
soon-to-be-privatised industries, he added. 'This plan is particular to the
railway industry.'
Trustees of the Rail Pension Scheme had been pressing hard for the
government to back down on its 'Option Two' outlined in the white paper on
rail privatisation. The government had proposed seizing a portion of the
pension scheme's assets in exchange for a promise to pay index-linked
pensions indefinitely. 'This is largely what the trustees were looking for,
but there are still some safeguards we are seeking,' said one trustee. In
particular, the trustees want assurances that ministerial powers over the
pension scheme may not be used to weaken the benefit structure in future
years nor to shift the cost-sharing in a way that forces members to increase
their proportion of contributions.
Answering questions at a news conference, Mr MacGregor said the new owners
of the privatised British Rail companies would have representation on the
Joint Industry Scheme board of trustees but not have the power either to
wind up the scheme nor to weaken its benefits without the consent of
parliament.
It is envisaged that the JIS will have a trustee company consisting of
employees and representatives of the new owners of British Rail.
The new employers also will be required to establish pension schemes for
members with benefits as good as those now available to British Rail
employees.
The government has promised that there will be no early-leaver penalties for
involuntary breaks in employment - a move which should protect those who are
made redundant by one company but re-employed by another.
In establishing the pool for current and deferred pensioners, of whom there
are roughly 150,000, a period will be allowed for the scheme to sell much of
its illiquid assets such as agricultural land, venture capital investments
and artworks.

FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Watts Blake shareholders fail to find buyer
for 45.2% stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATTS BLAKE Bearne's fight to remain independent received a boost yesterday
when three of its big shareholders said they had failed to find a buyer for
their combined stake of 45.2 per cent.
The companies will continue to act as a concert party. Under takeover rules
the sale to a single party would have led to an offer for the entire issued
share capital of the ball clay producer.
The three investors, which had hoped to sell their shares by May 18, are
Ceramics Holdings, controlled by the Lebanese Gargour family, Sibelco, a
privately-owned Belgian-based producer of silica sand for the glass
industry, and Quarzwerke, a private German producer of silica sand.
Mr John Pike, Watts Blake Bearne managing director, said: 'I am very pleased
that their offer for sale terminated. However, the concert party remains in
force. The sooner this thing is sorted out the better.'
The three shareholders are expected to try and sell their shares again,
although they have not yet formally made a decision. J Henry Schroder Wagg,
the merchant bank, is advising them.
Mr Pike is concerned that it could be difficult to mount a defence if the
sale of a large block of shares triggered a bid at an unsatisfactory price.
Watts Blake Bearne's shares fell 10p to 410p.

<TEXT>
THE EQUITABLE, the US life insurance company which is 49 per cent owned by
France's Axa group, told shareholders yesterday that it was looking at ways
in which it might bolster its balance sheet by attaching a more accurate
valuation on its Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette brokerage unit, writes Nikki
Tait.
Mr Richard Jenrette, Equitable's chairman, told the annual meeting that
options included floating shares in DLJ separately on the stock market, or
selling an interest in the business to an outside investor. However, he
stressed that no final decision had been taken.
DLJ is currently carried on Equitable's books for about Dollars 500m, but Mr
Jenrette suspected that the market value could be 'about double' that.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Venables fights back over Spurs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TERRY Venables has counter-attacked against the attempt to oust him from
Tottenham Hotspur football club by seeking to force Mr Alan Sugar, the
chairman, to sell his 48 per cent stake in the company to Mr Venables or his
backers.
Mr Venables, who borrowed most of the Pounds 3m he has invested in
Tottenham, would have to put together a consortium of backers to buy out Mr
Sugar, whose stake was valued at Pounds 7.73m at yesterday's closing price
of 101p.
Mr Sugar, the electronics millionaire, last week tried to sack Mr Venables
as chief executive. It emerged that Mr Sugar had offered to buy Mr Venables'
22 per cent stake at the price he paid for it - an average of about 85p a
share.
Mr Venables' counter-attack forms part of a petition to be presented to the
High Court. On Friday he obtained a court order reinstating him until a
hearing next Tuesday.
A transcript of Friday's judgment by Mrs Justice Arden refers to the two
main points of Mr Venables' petition: 'that Amshold (Mr Sugar's vehicle) may
be ordered to sell its shares in the company to the petitioner, or as the
petitioner may direct, at such price as the court may determine' and that
the company should be prevented from terminating Mr Venables' contract.
The judge heard that Mr Venables ran the football-related activities of the
company, that his appointment as chief executive - he was previously manager
of the football team - was agreed with Mr Sugar, and that Mr Venables'
removal would damage the company, which had 'made a major financial recovery
while Mr Venables has been chief executive'.
Mr Venables had expressed concern about control of the company in December
1991, before a Pounds 7m rights issue underwritten by Mr Sugar which gave Mr
Sugar, as chairman, a much larger stake. It was alleged that Mr Sugar said:
'Trust me - even if I pick up all the shares, we have a shareholders'
agreement.'
Mr Nick Hewer, Mr Sugar's public relations representative, said last night
there was no comment on the transcript. It had been impossible to present
any evidence at Friday's hearing, which was held at very short notice, he
said.

<TEXT>
Corporacion Banesto, the industrial holding owned by the Spain's Banesto
banking group, reported first-quarter pre-tax profits of Pta147m (Dollars
1.8bn), against a Pta4.6bn loss in the same period of 1992.
The holding said turnover was down 30 per cent to Pta69.8bn and that the
sharp turnaround was in part due to lowered debt servicing costs.

FT  20 MAY 93 / PowerGen poised to win east German energy contract
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A UTILITIES consortium headed by Britain's PowerGen and the US-based NRG is
close to completing a contract which will give it a 44 per cent share in
generating power at a plant in eastern Germany.
The deal, involving construction of a small regional plant at Schkopau, near
Leipzig, could help to open up Germany's utilities to outside competition,
officials from Vereinigte Energie AG (Veag), the east German utilities
company, said yesterday.
The contract is for PowerGen and NRG to build a 400MW power station. Until
recently, Veba Kraftwerke Ruhr had planned to build a 900MW station at
Schkopau. VKR is a 100 per cent subsidiary of PreussenElektra, which
undertakes the electricity operations of Veba, the German energy-based
conglomerate.
The decision to allow PowerGen and NRG to negotiate a 44 per cent share at
Schkopau follows lengthy negotiations between the Treuhand, the agency
responsible for the privatisation of eastern German industry, Veag, which
controls 70 per cent of the region's energy production, and VKR.
Veag is technically still under the Treuhand, but legally it is controlled
by Germany's three giant utilities companies, and the five smaller ones,
following a treaty signed in 1990. These include PreussenElektra, RWE
Energie and Bayernwerk, western Germany's powerful utilities.
Under the terms of the treaty, the Stromvertrag, eastern Germany's regional
utilities are obliged to buy 70 per cent of their power from Veag over the
next 20 years as a means of underwriting large investments needed to
modernise eastern Germany's energy sector. This treaty, however, has had the
effect of making it difficult to introduce competition into the energy
sector in the region.
The consortium had earlier tried to seek a stake in generating power at
Lippendorf. But the negotiations collapsed because PowerGen and NRG could
not seek guarantees to gain access to the high voltage grid in order to sell
its energy.
The power generators at Schkopau will be fuelled by Mibrag, eastern
Germany's giant lignite mining complex. PowerGen and NRG have the sole
negotiating rights to buy Mibrag, which is under the Treuhand.

bond issue in domestic market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, yesterday
launched a FM300m (Dollars 54m) perpetual subordinated bond issue in the
domestic market to help strengthen its capital base.
The move is part of a broader plan to raise FM2bn in Tier Two capital on the
domestic and international markets in the next few years, following the
bank's recent successful FM1bn rights issue. Like other Finnish banks, KOP
has suffered heavy losses and its capital adequacy ratio has been badly
eroded.
The subordinated bonds are the first perpetuals to be issued by KOP. The
coupon is 1.4 per cent above 6-month Helibor for the first five years, 1.90
per cent above 6-month Helibor for the next five years, and 2.4 per cent
above 6-month Helibor in subsequent years.
The issue price is 100 per cent and the subscription period runs from May 26
to June 24.

FT  20 MAY 93 / The hole at Hungary's banking heart: Nicholas Denton reports
on the need for a recapitalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Behind the World Bank and International Monetary Fund's belief that
Hungary's big banks need rescuing are some compelling facts.
The capital of the two biggest banks - Magyar Hitel Bank and Kereskedelmi
Bank - is wiped out when international accounting standards are applied to
their bad loans. Economic output has fallen 18 per cent in the last three
years. The disappearance of demand from former Comecon countries has
worsened the recession, hitting hardest the socialist industrial giants like
Ikarus, Taurus, Videoton and Borsodchem which make up the rotten core of
Hitel Bank's clientele.
In 1991 parliament passed strict new laws: on bankruptcy, causing about a
tenth of companies to go into liquidation or file for protection from
creditors; and on financial institutions, giving banks the incentive to
recognise bad debts.
The banking sector's loans classified as bad, doubtful or substandard rose
to Ft262bn (Dollars 2.9bn) - 17 per cent of all loans and 10 per cent of GDP
 -in September 1992. Hitel Bank says its non-performing loans tripled from
Ft25bn in December 1991 to Ft78bn at the peak last year.
The result has been a sharp credit crunch. Banks, faced with the need to
make huge provisions, have charged high real interest rates to maintain
margins and produce paper operating profits estimated at Ft39.7bn for the
whole sector in 1992. The average interest rate on short-term corporate
loans was 28.2 per cent at the end of 1992, compared with inflation of 21.6
per cent over the year.
The cost of borrowing has pushed bad risks to the wall and good risks abroad
 -or, like Nestle, McDonalds and other western investors in Hungary,
directly to the capital markets.
Made cautious by defaults, banks slightly reduced their outstanding credit
to enterprises in 1992, a sharp fall in real terms. 'A prudent policy today
means extreme conservatism,' says Mr Gyorgy Ivanyi, president of
Inter-Europa Bank. The World Bank study concludes that: 'The financial
system is unable to finance the transformation to a market economy.'
A one-off recapitalisation is widely seen as essential. Economic recovery is
still feeble and loan portfolios are deteriorating. Weaker banks are losing
their better clients to stronger ones. Mr Szalkai admits that Hitel Bank is
at a 'threshold,' from which it could spiral downwards.
Recapitalisation must also put the banking sector into condition for
privatisation before more of the potential acquirers lose patience and set
up local subsidiaries from scratch.
An injection of funds, however, would allow bank managers to escape the
consequence of past errors. Magyar Hitel Bank, Kereskedelmi Bank and
Budapest Bank inherited a portfolio of loans made under communist logic when
hived off from the National Bank of Hungary in 1987. Since then, managers
have been responsible for their own decisions - and some of them have proved
painful.
Hitel Bank, for instance, has paid the price of a focus on lending to
start-up businesses. The policy has won popularity, but the losses have been
heavy. Mr Szalkai says that the default rate for new business is as high as
on the old, communist-inspired loans.
Kontrax, one of Hungary's largest domestic private groups, only this month
declared bankruptcy owing Ft4.2bn to Hitel Bank and other creditors. Hitel
Bank has also been reluctant to reduce exposure to inherited shaky borrowers
for fear of pushing them into bankruptcy. 'In creditors' meetings Hitel Bank
is always there,' says a banker.
In contrast, Budapest Bank has pulled away from the other two commercial
banks. Under Mr Lajos Bokros, managing director, Budapest Bank's capital has
improved as a proportion of assets from -5.5 per cent in 1992 to +2.2 per
cent this year.
In 1991, Mr Bokros anticipated the wave of client bankruptcies to come. He
defied the finance ministry's hunger for taxable profits and provisioned
furiously.
Mr Bokros has taken a pay cut, drives a second-hand Renault and flies
economy class. He has refused to follow other banks in financing newspapers
and political foundations.
This approach has won him the admiration of the Budapest financial
community. But it has done him little good politically. The World Bank study
calls for managment changes at the worse performing banks. Yet it is over Mr
Bokros's future that the biggest political uncertainties hang.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Italy's bribes scandal has multinational air
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE arrest of Mr Giorgio Scanavaca, managing director of the Italian
subsidiary of Siemens, the German industrial group, casts a further shadow
over the activities of foreign multinationals in Italy's widening political
corruption scandal.
It is almost a year since ABB, the Swiss-Swedish engineering and electronics
group, first appeared in the investigations, then still largely limited to
Milan. The group was alleged to have paid about L16bn (Dollars 10.8m) in
kickbacks to obtain orders for the city's underground railway line.
The foreign trail went relatively cold thereafter, bar a further bout for
ABB, whose chief executive in Italy, Mr Umberto Di Capua, was arrested and
briefly jailed on allegations believed to be linked to the metro orders. Mr
Di Capua, who only joined the company after the completion of the new line,
was released soon after.
However, in the past week, the foreigners have been making a comeback. Last
week saw the arrests of senior executives from the Italian subsidiaries of
both Sweden's Ericsson and GEC of the UK on allegations linked to contracts
from ASST, the former state telephones agency.
The list has now been lengthened with the detention of Mr Scanavaca as Milan
magistrates pursue their latest line of investigations into alleged bribes
on orders for telecommunications equipment.
However, the German group is not a complete stranger to the corruption
scandal. In May 1992, investigations into alleged corruption in a hospital
south of Milan, triggered allegations that the company had handed over about
L50m in kickbacks to win a contract.
The impact on the standing of foreign companies in Italy is still being
digested and public reaction has been limited so far. Officials at Ericsson
were unavailable for comment yesterday, while a Siemens official had 'no
comment' to make on the arrest of Mr Scanavaca beyond pointing out that he
had come forward to testify before magistrates voluntarily on Tuesday
evening. The official also pointed out that Siemens Telecommunicazioni, the
subsidiary chaired by Mr Scanavaca, was formerly owned by GTE, the US
telecoms group, prior to its takeover by Siemens in 1987-88. The subsidiary
specialises in public networks and transmission systems.
So far, only ABB appears to have taken its alleged involvement on board.
Well before the inauguration of Fiat's new 'ethical code of business
practice' last week, the company had already moved to tighten up its
procedures. The group already had a chapter on ethics in its booklet on
business values drawn up in 1988.
Following its brush with the Italian magistrates, procedures at its
subsidiary were reinforced, with executives obliged to sign a letter
committing themselves to respecting the national law in any dealing with
public-sector employees.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Danish tax rates cut as reward for treaty vote: Fringe group
blamed for riot; growth package to boost economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DANISH government yesterday brushed aside violent demonstrations sparked
by Tuesday's referendum result endorsing the European Community's Maastricht
treaty, and as a reward for the Yes vote announced a programme to stimulate
economic growth and employment.
The riots in an inner city district of Copenhagen left 11 demonstrators
wounded by police gunfire and 26 policemen injured. They were said by
officials to have been the worst peacetime disturbances in Denmark. The
government blamed a small fringe group of militant squatters.
Yesterday, the area returned quickly to normal, but local residents were
braced in case of further disturbances last night. The government insisted
the attacks did not represent the feelings of the vast majority of No
voters.
Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Social Democratic prime minister, condemned the
riots as an isolated incident and told parliament the government would slash
marginal income tax rates to bring them closer into line with the rest of
the EC. State investment plans to push up growth in gross domestic product
from under 1 per cent this year to almost 3.5 per cent in 1994 would also be
brought forward.
At the same time, Denmark's central bank cut the official discount rate to
8.25 per cent from 9.25 per cent and commercial banks announced similar
reductions in their lending and deposit rates, which had been held
artificially high because of uncertainty over the Maastricht vote.
Business reaction was positive. The Copenhagen stock market, which had risen
strongly in expectation of a Yes vote, put on a further 2.30 points to close
at 303.89.
The tax cuts are aimed at galvanising other EC member states to rally behind
a beefed-up economic growth package ahead of next month's EC summit in
Copenhagen.
The Danish presidency of the EC, working with the European Commission, wants
member states to consider fresh measures to stimulate growth, mainly through
shifting to capital spending, making the labour market more flexible, and
other fiscal incentives to create jobs.
The growth package and the unemployment crisis in the EC are top of the
agenda at a two-day meeting of EC finance ministers in Kolding, Denmark,
which starts tomorrow.
In Brussels yesterday, Commission officials hailed the Danish endorsement of
the Maastricht treaty in Tuesday's second referendum as giving a
'psychological lift' to the Community after several months of drift.
The positive vote has given new impetus to the Danish presidency. Danish
officials vowed to press for agreement on issues such as a new trade
liberalisation package for eastern Europe before Denmark hands over the
presidency to Belgium on July 1.
The Danes approved Maastricht by a margin of 56.8 per cent in favour to 43.2
per cent against, on an 86.2 per cent turnout, reversing the rejection of
the treaty in a poll last June.
Mr Rasmussen said the signal from Danish voters was that Europe's political
leaders must close the gap that had opened between them and their
electorates over Maastricht by adopting pragmatic policies which tackled
problems such as unemployment. 'We have to be more engaged', he said.
He said the government's economic package would bring the jobless rate down
from 12 per cent at present to about 11 per cent in 1994. Marginal income
tax rates would be cut from next year to a band of 38 to 58 per cent,
compared with 52 to 68 per cent at present.
The tax cuts will eventually be financed by 'green' taxes on petrol,
electricity, heating, water consumption and, among other things, plastic
bags.

<TEXT>
FINANCIAL journalists were not very welcome at the 'youth house' in
Copenhagen's Norrebro district yesterday morning, after the violent clashes
sparked by Denmark's Yes vote in the Maastricht referendum on Tuesday left
11 young demonstrators with gunshot wounds and 26 policemen injured by
bricks.
'You and your businessmen, you are the ones that are pushing us down,'
snarled a bearded man sitting on the doorstep of the collective meeting
place, drinking from a bottle of beer. 'You are just like the police,' added
an angry young woman seated close by.
The typically black-clad, unkempt and unemployed youths that make up the
loose movement known in Denmark as BZers, or squatters, were said by the
police to have instigated the post-referendum riot.
No longer simply homeless occupiers of empty inner-city buildings, they are
better defined these days by their anti-business, anti-fascist and
anti-establishment views that see the European Community at the pinnacle of
a capitalist conspiracy to deny democracy to the masses.
The main target of the rioters - apart from the police - were a number of
bank branches in Norrebro which had their windows smashed.
Hard-core BZers probably number no more than a few hundred, though they may
have the sympathy of several thousand more disaffected youngsters in the
capital. Between 300 and 500 demonstrators were said to have been involved
in Tuesday night's disturbances.
The BZers have been a feature of life in inner city Copenhagen for the past
15 years. They periodically clash with police, sometimes smashing windows in
commercial premises in the city centre, but had not previously been involved
in violence on the scale of that which erupted on Tuesday.
Last winter they caused serious problems for Swedish police in Malmo, just
across the Oresund from Copenhagen, when they staged a counter-protest
against Swedish anti-immigrant demonstrators.
The government, led by the Social Democratic party, was appalled that its
success in getting Maastricht approved at the second attempt on Tuesday was
marred by what were for Denmark extremely rare scenes of vicious street
violence. It said the rioters were an isolated fringe who deliberately set
out to cause trouble.
'That is pure bullshit,' scoffed a third BZer, speaking inside the dingy
'youth house' under a huge mural saying 'Smash Racism and Fascism'. In
common with his colleagues, he refused to give his name - and spoke fluent
and richly profane English.
His friend insisted the riot was spontaneous. 'Everyone who voted No was
very depressed and angry. We wanted to do something. We wanted to go crazy.'
The other inhabitants of Norrebro, a relatively poor but far from deprived
area, tended to confirm the government's view that the BZers were a small
group who do not represent a wide band of opinion.
An apartment block caretaker said: 'There used to be sympathy around here
for them because they have no hope of jobs or homes. But when we helped
them, with collections of money, they just screwed things up. We have no
problems with the local police here. We respect them. I think the people
last night came from outside.'

THE DANISH government yesterday brushed aside violent demonstrations sparked

The riots in an inner city district of Copenhagen left 11 demonstrators
wounded by police gunfire and 26 policemen injured. They were said by
officials to have been the worst peacetime disturbances in Denmark. The
government blamed a small fringe group of militant squatters, know as BZers.
Little damage was done to property, the main targets being the windows of
several bank branches and a few damaged cars. Yesterday the area returned
quickly to normal, but local residents were braced in case of further
disturbances last night. The government insisted the attacks did not
represent the feelings of the vast majority of No voters.
Condemning the riots as an isolated incident, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the
Social Democratic prime minister, told parliament the government would slash
marginal income tax rates to bring them closer into line with the rest of
the EC and bring forward state investment plans to push up growth in gross
domestic product from under 1 per cent this year to almost 3.5 per cent in
1994.
Mr Rasmussen said the signal from Danish voters was that Europe's political
leaders must close the gap that had opened between them and their
electorates over Maastricht by adopting pragmatic policies which tackled
problems such as unemployment, which have a direct impact on the everyday
lives of European citizens. 'We have to be more engaged', he said.
At the same time, Denmark's central bank cut the official discount rate to
8.25 per cent from 9.25 per cent and commercial banks announced similar
reductions in their lending and deposit rates, which had been held
artificially high because of uncertainty over the Maastricht vote.
Business reaction was positive. The Copenhagen stock market, which had risen

other fiscal incentives to create jobs.
The 'growth package' and the unemployment crisis in the EC are top of the
agenda at a two-day meeting of EC finance ministers in Kolding, Denmark,
which starts tomorrow.
Mr Rasmussen said the government's economic package would 'break the curve
of rising unemployment', bringing the jobless rate down from 12 per cent at
present to about 11 per cent in 1994. Called 'New Course for Better Times',
the package will reduce marginal income tax rates from next year to a band
of 38-58 per cent, compared with 52-68 per cent at present.
The tax cuts will eventually be financed by 'green' taxes on petrol,
electricity, heating, water consumption and, among other things, plastic
bags. But there will be a strong stimulus to private spending next year
because the full impact of the green taxes will not take effect immediately.
The boost from tax cuts in 1994 will be equal to about 0.5 per cent of GDP,
or about DKr5bn (Pounds 526m), and should produce growth in real private
consumption next year of 4.3 per cent. An accompanying upgrade of training
programmes is designed to improve the skills of the workforce.

FT  20 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Enterprise weakens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil was the worst hit in a weak oil sector as dealers reacted to
the re-emergence of rumours that a large block of shares in the company
could soon be sold.
'It is an early start to the silly season in Enterprise,' said one oil
specialist, referring to long-running stories that a 6.3m block of shares in
Enterprise held by Lehman Brothers might be sold off shortly. Lehman
acquired the Enterprise shares via its participation in the listing of
Enterprise ADRs in the US last year.
Speculation started with news that Enterprise is updating the prospectus it
prepared for the ADR listing. However, it was pointed out that Lehman had
been free to sell its Enterprise stock since the second half of last year.
The shares closed 16 lower at 459p.
The much-vaunted bond issue from Allied-Lyons knocked the shares in a drinks
sector weakened by the Bass performance. Allied lost 12 to 531p. Results, an
aquisition and a rights issue left Compass Group a penny better at 528p.
The fallout from the bearish statement by BSN, the French food manufacturer,
on Tuesday continued to impact on its UK counterparts. Unilever bore the
brunt yesterday, crumbling 22 to 1014p.
Pharmaceuticals group Medeva added 4 at 221p after announcing a strategic
alliance with Matrix, of the US, to sell skin products in the US and Europe.
Portals gained 8 at 474p, with some analysts signalling the relative value
in the shares. Williams de Broe was pointing out the specialist paper
maker's modest price/earnings ratio in the sector.
A Pounds 73m rights issue from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi was well received and after
the initial knock-back the shares recovered to close only 2 off at 170p,
after hitting a low of 161p.
Tobacco and insurance group BAT Industries dropped again under the pressure
of a fall on Wall Street and cautious statements at BAT's annual meeting on
Tuesday. A decline in Philip Morris shares in New York also affected BAT
shares in London.
The stock failed to respond to positive advice from several UK analysts,
including a buy note from Nikko Securities and research from NatWest
Securities. The latter pointed out the 'good value on yield, dividend growth
and discount-to-asset grounds' but the stock closed a net 21 1/2 lower at
822 1/2 p.
Hanson was another blue chip international trader failing to respond to buy
recommendations, which were based on the conglomerate's solid yield. The
shares receded 4 1/2 to 233 1/4 p.
Healthcare group Reckitt &amp; Colman advanced 5 to 549p after announcing a
performance in line with current growth targets.
Wellcome reacted belatedly to news that it has received UK approval to sell
the cream version of its anti-herpes product Zovirax over the counter in
chemist shops for treating cold sores. The approval, announced on Tuesday,
was expected but the shares rose 15 to 764p yesterday.
International conglomerate BTR moved against the market trend, adding 4 at
585p in trade of 2.2m after SG Warburg reiterated its positive stance, ahead
of today's agm.
English China Clays fell 15 to 433p after NatWest Securities downgraded
profits expectations. The house reduced its current year estimate by Pounds
15m to Pounds 85m and the following year's figure by Pounds 18m to Pounds
114m.
Renewed weakness in crude oil prices as the market continued to fret about
next month's Opec meeting upset the whole of the oil sector.
Lasmo, whose place in the FT-SE 100 Index is in jeopardy, fell in sympathy
with Enterprise Oil and was additionally unsettled by some heavy selling in
the traded options market, ending 8 weaker at 146p. This left the stock
firmly at the bottom of the FT-SE 100 table.
BP was heavily sold, especially by US investors after talk that one of the
leading Wall Street broking houses had taken the stock off its 'buy' list.
It finished 7 1/2 cheaper at 307 1/2 p.
Poor sentiment at GKN's annual meeting led to another round of profits
downgradings, causing further weakness in the stock. The chairman said the
company's trading results during the first four months of the year were
'marginally' behind those of last year, with European markets weaker than
anticipated.
Analysts who had reduced estimates only two weeks ago moved to make further
cuts, and the range of current year forecasts is now between Pounds 125m and
Pounds 145m. The stock fell 7 to 436p after higher than average trade of
5.6m shares.
The negative sentiment in GKN, coupled with worries about a dividend cut,
depressed Lucas Industries, which dipped 3 to 134p.
British Aerospace reversed an initial decline to end a net 7 higher at 331p
after Kleinwort Benson upgraded its 1994 profits forecast. Leaving its
current year estimate at Pounds 125m, the securities house increased the
following year's forecast by Pounds 20m to Pounds 200m, citing improvements
in the defence sector and at Rover, BAe's car manufacturing subsidiary.

FT  20 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gold shares busy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest upsurge in the gold price triggered further strength in South
African gold shares and lifted the FT-Actuaries Gold Mines Index to its
highest level since August 1991.
The bullion price reached a 29-month peak at one point but came under severe
pressure later after rumours that Mr George Soros, the US investor, had
begun to sell.
London trading in South African golds built up throughout the session, with
the top quality producers such as Vaal Reefs touching Dollars 74 before
retreating to trade around the Dollars 71 level. Driefontein peaked at
Dollars 12 3/4 before slipping to Dollars 12 1/4 .
One leading trader said there was broad demand for golds, with South African
institutions buying aggressively, closely followed by Continental and US
investors. London buyers were more restrained.
The sudden strength in metal prices gave a further boost to Lonrho, the
UK-based conglomerate with substantial interests in precious metals via big
holdings in Ashanti, the Ghanaian gold mine, and Western Platinum, the South
African platinum mine.
Lonrho rose 2 to 116 1/2 p, its best level for more than a year. Dealers
said Lonrho's recent strength was in the face of some exceptionally heavy
selling. Yesterday it was announced that the Malaysian-based Genting group
of companies had reduced holdings in Lonrho by around 7m shares to 38.1m.
'There has been a subtle but positive shift in the London market's view of
Lonrho since the arrival of Mr Dieter Bock at Lonrho last year,' said one
dealer.

FT  20 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Bass out of market favour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISAPPOINTING results from Bass, Britain's largest brewer, sent the shares
into freefall in their largest recorded daily trading volume. The stock
ended at 483p, down 50, with turnover reaching 11m.
Every drinks specialist seemed to have a particular grouse with the Bass
interim report, ranging from disappointment with Holiday Inns to
astonishment at the level of cash outflow. The first-half outcome was a
profits figure well below the most cautious City forecasts, prompting a
welter of downgrades and negative comments.
Kleinwort Benson lowered its full year forecast by 10 per cent to Pounds
503m, while NatWest cut to Pounds 508m and SGST to Pounds 490m.
Analysts also reported a gloomy post-results meeting. Mr Geoff Collyer at
NatWest said: 'There was nothing in the Bass explanation that indicated that
their strategy is going to work.' SGST's Ms Alex Oldroyd added: 'Even if
trading picks up, investors will take a lot of convincing to get back into
the stock.'
Other sector specialists claimed that some disgruntled institutional
investors were critical of the Bass management and there was speculation
that pressure could be exerted for a splitting of the roles of chairman and
chief executive.

FT  20 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares slide as sales news
disappoints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNFAVOURABLE news from the UK consumer sector, together with receding hopes
of lower interest rates, cut into share prices in London yesterday, taking
the Footsie Index down towards the 2,800 mark. Trading volume increased
again, but once again the second line stocks outperformed the blue chips.
Denmark's voting approval for the Maastricht treaty had little effect.
Share prices opened lower and an attempted rally was quickly extinguished.
The late recovery on Wall Street overnight did little to lift London's
doubts on the outlook for the New York market.
UK stocks began to slide at mid-morning as sentiment was upset first on the
domestic and then on the international front. Disclosure of a sharp rise in
German money supply in April and the absence of any rate change at the
Bundesbank meeting put UK interest rate hopes back on to the sidelines.
News that UK retail sales had fallen by 0.3 per cent last month served to
increase the City's distaste for the interim results from Bass, one of the
leading UK brewers, which shook the sector by indicating a continued decline
in beer sales and profits.
The slide in the market quickened as London traders backed away ahead of the
opening of the new Wall Street session. In the event the Dow Industrial
Average was down only 7 points in UK hours, but London stocks remained
around their day's lows, with the Footsie nearly 30 points off at 2,817.7 at
worst.
The final reading of 2,819.7 gave a loss on the day of 27.6 points. Even
those traders who had warned that the stock market was merely moving within
an established trading range of 2,787 to 2,890 sounded surprised at the
speed of its reaction over the past two days.
One reason is the return of the rights issue flow, although this is at
reduced pressure for the moment. Three issues were brought forward yesterday
for a total of more than Pounds 350m, suggesting that the rights issue queue
is being speeded up because of the weight of issues in the pipeline.
Yesterday's cash calls included the Pounds 200m convertible rights from
Allied-Lyons, which had been widely expected on Monday, and two smaller
equity calls from Compass Securities and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. Some relief came
from the satisfactory reception for the next Pounds 3bn auction of
government bonds.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index again outperformed the Footsie, losing only 2.2
points to 3,149 and remaining within a few points of its all-time high.
However, turnover in non-Footsie stocks remained relatively low at only
about 59 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 647.5m shares, compared with
633.4m in the previous session. The official total of customer business,
which tends to disclose the strength of institutional business, increased on
Tuesday to return a worth of Pounds 1.25bn.
Some strategists perceive selling pressure from the big institutions, which
are believed to be short of cash and fearful that equity rights calls and
gilt-edged funding demands could catch them out over the next month.
The latest reports from UK industry have done little to sustain faith in an
early recovery in business activity and this, coupled with inflationary
signs in the US and in Europe, have discouraged fund managers in London.

FT  20 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FADING hopes of a reduction in interest rates, together with poor economic
data from both the US and the UK, led to aggressive selling of Footsie
futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first trade in the June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index was struck at
2,859 and initially led to hopes of a strong buying session.
However, those hopes faded with the release of German money supply figures
showing a sharp rise. Dealers took this as a signal of no cut in UK base
rates and it triggered an aggressive wave of selling, led mainly by
independent traders.
This increased with the release of worse than expected UK retail sales
figures, and the continued fall led to the erosion of the premium by
mid-session.
In the afternoon, dealers focused on the poor US budget deficit statistics,
sending the contract lower in anticipation of a poor opening on Wall Street.
Sporadic bargain hunting was seen in the late afternoon when New York opened
firmer than anticipated.
June finished at 2,828, down 30 from its previous close and around 6 points
ahead of its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 5.
Turnover was 11,201 at the official close.
Volume in the traded options was a hefty 41,096 lots, of which 13,017
contracts were in the FT-SE 100 option. Barclays was the busiest stock
option with 1,445 lots.

FT  20 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow surges to record high on
program buying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER falling in early trading on futures-related activity, US stocks
rebounded strongly on computer program buying to end at an all-time high,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 55.64 ahead at 3,500.03, comfortably
eclipsing the previous record of 3,482.31 set last week. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 gained 7.25 at 447.57, while the American SE composite rose 1.70
to a record 429.92 and the Nasdaq composite climbed 9.65 to 690.43.
New York SE trading volume jumped to 342.4m shares, the third highest of the
year.
Share prices fell sharply in the first few hours of trading in the wake of
another rise in bond yields, which on Tuesday broke through the 7 per cent
barrier for the first time in more than a month. Although inflationary fears
were again behind the fall in bond prices, news of stronger than expected
imports in the April merchandise trade report also contributed to the
selling of longer-dated Treasuries.
The decline in stock prices was exacerbated by activity in the futures
market, where the S &amp; P 500 stock index futures contract fell through a
technical support level, triggering selling in both the futures and the
underlying cash markets.
Stock and bond prices turned sharply around in the afternoon after gold
prices, which had risen steeply in the morning, suddenly retreated. The
recent surge in gold has undermined the attractiveness of bonds and stocks,
so the drop in gold prices yesterday was welcomed by both debt and equity
investors, and helped to trigger some late computer program buying which
lifted stocks to new highs.
Gold shares lost some of their lustre as profit-takers moved in. Newmont
Mining retreated Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 50 3/8 , Battle Mountain Gold
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 8 3/4 on 5.4m shares traded and Home-stake Mining
Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 16 3/4 .
Motor issues also came under early selling pressure. Ford fell sharply for
the second consecutive day, dropping Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 52 1/8 as it
was further undermined by news that brokerage house Merrill Lynch had
lowered its intermediate-term rating on the stock.
The two other big motor stocks, however, rebounded with the market. Chrysler
ended Dollars 1 1/4 up at Dollars 43 3/4 and General Motors Dollars  1/2
firmer at Dollars 39 3/4 .
Hewlett-Packard, which posted surprisingly strong quarterly earnings on
Tuesday, climbed a further Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 87 3/4 in volume of 2m
shares.
On the Nasdaq market, Microsoft forged ahead Dollars 4 to Dollars 92 1/2 in
volume of 5.6m shares after two broking firms upgraded the stock.
Canada
TORONTO finished mixed to lower in extremely active trading after a drop in
gold shares. The TSE 300 index shed 15.6 to 3,811.3 and declines led rises
by 348 to 346 after volume of 83.4m shares valued at CDollars 683.1m. The
golds index fell 5.93 per cent as the New York spot gold bullion price lost
USDollars 1.50 an ounce.
Details of the Ontario budget came after the market close.

FT  20 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses switch into reverse in
late trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLY improvement on the Danish Maastricht vote was eroded yesterday as
bourses reviewed unexpectedly high money supply growth in Germany, and the
absence of interest rate cuts at the Bundesbank meeting.
The Eurotrack index produced an intraday switch into reverse, the trend
apparently confirmed by a weak start on Wall Street, writes Our Markets
Staff.
MILAN was in optimistic mood and a broadly-based rally took the Comit index
up 14.30 or 2.6 per cent to a 21 month high of 558.49.
A half point fall in Italy's minimum repurchase rate to 10.50 per cent, the
lowest since November 1991, was seen as setting the stage for a discount
rate cut of at least half a percentage point, possibly after the government
approves a L13 trillion package of deficit cuts in the next few days.
Mr Marco Ortelli of Akros Sim in Milan noted strong foreign demand,
particularly for the telecommunications sector. At the same time, domestic
funds were reluctant to sell since the Comit's breach of the 550 level
opened the way for a technical rally to around 580, he said.
Fiat remained volatile, fixing L373 or 5.9 per cent higher at L6,700 but
easing to L6,600. Generali added L1,155 or 3 per cent to L38,650 before
L38,550 after-hours and Mediobanca was L799 or 4.8 per cent higher at
L17,199 as foreign funds increased their weighting of the Italian market.
Olivetti rose L61 or 4.5 per cent to L1,410 before L1,420 on the kerb in
continued response to Monday's rights issue, while Parmalat added L676 or
4.3 per cent to L16,437 on further consideration of its rights issue terms.
ZURICH edged forward to a third consecutive record close, ahead of today's
Ascension Day holiday which marks the start of a long weekend away for many
investors. The SMI index added 0.1 to 2,227.0, continuing to take a lead
from the strong dollar.
The market began firmly, as positions were squared ahead of tomorrow's
expiry of futures and options on Soffex, but prices eased back from their
best levels later.
Holderbank bearers added SFr17 to SFr656 in active trade ahead of
presentations to analysts next Monday and amid optimism at the outlook for
first quarter results.
Winterthur certificates shed SFr7 to SFr614 on further consideration of
plans to swap its certificates into registered shares after splitting
registered shares and bearers on a five for one basis. The registered shares
shed SFr40 to SFr3,060.
FRANKFURT's financials reflected its fiscal disappointments, Allianz falling
DM23 to DM2,099, Deutsche Bank by DM5.50 to DM691 and Dresdner DM5 to DM369
as the DAX index closed 11.07 lower at 1,617.41.
Turnover declined from DM5.7bn to DM5.1bn. Deutsche Bank lost ground
although it reported full group operating profits up about 20 per cent in
the first four months of 1993, compared to one third of last year's total,
and mooted a higher dividend this year.
Elsewhere there was activity, mostly bearish, in consumer stocks where
Douglas, the upmarket retailer of perfumes and toiletries, fell DM17.50 to
DM480 and Escada, the fashion group, dropped DM18 to DM220 after reporting a
first half loss.
Mr Adrian Hopkinson of NatWest Securities thought that Douglas might reflect
difficulties reported in luxury products at Wella yesterday. Ironically,
Wella rose DM17 to DM719 as it forecast another drop in raw material costs
this year, after a fall of 7 per cent helped margins in 1992.
AMSTERDAM fell back sharply in reaction to the German M3 data, a weak
opening on Wall Street and options activity. The CBS Tendency index lost 2.1
or 2 per cent to 104.2.
Unilever and Heineken were among the day's biggest losers, both falling Fl
2.60 to Fl 190.60 and Fl 178.80 respectively. Heineken has been falling
recently partly on speculation about possible losses at the Spanish brewer
in which it holds a 50 per cent stake.
PARIS, on the last day of the account, saw high turnover which was swelled
by a number of block trades crossing the market during the session. The
CAC-40 index, which had earlier seen a day's high of 1,853, finished down
9.62 at 1,836.78 in turnover of some FFr4.8bn.
One of the day's biggest losers was Michelin, down FFr5.60 or 3.8 per cent
at FFr141.50, while BSN managed a modest FFr1 rise to FFr864 following
Tuesday's fall after it announced plans to cut prices on some of its
products.
MADRID hit another downgrade in its erratic, post-devaluation career, the
general index closing 1.70 lower at 255.19.
STOCKHOLM added options-related selling in Astra A, down SKr12 to SKr730
after an initial jump of of SKr18 to SKr760, as the Affarsvarlden General
index fell 6.7 to 1,076.5. COPENHAGEN lost much of its early gains as the
detail of tax reform plans took over from the Maastricht vote. The KFX index
closed 0.22 up at 87.09 in turnover of DKr1.1bn. HELSINKI was stronger after
a threatened strike in the country's export sector was called off. The HEX
index gained 32.5 or 2.7 per cent to 1,217.2 in turnover of FM230m.

FT  20 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Economic worries take their toll -
European equity turnover fell back in April
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The high levels of equity trading seen throughout Europe during the first
three months of the year lost impetus in April as a raft of political and
economic worries began to take their toll.
Turnover in the eight leading European markets fell by 25.3 per cent in
April, reversing a 22.8 per cent March rise. April's decline reflected a
fall in market indices, with the FT-A Europe index losing 1.9 per cent over
the month.
Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities says lower turnover was particularly
noticeable in the second half of the month as investors took profits: 'In
contrast to March when turnover swelled on a flat market, selling in April
seems to have led to prices falling and volumes declining, in the absence of
ready buyers.'
He adds that while turnover was also lower overall on Seaq International,
the London screen-based dealing system for foreign shares, the fall was less
pronounced than on domestic exchanges. Seaq turnover as a percentage of the
domestic market rose to record levels for both French shares, at 53.1 per
cent compared with 44.2 per cent in March, and German shares, 15.4 per cent
after March's 11.5 per cent.
Mr Marcus Grubb of Salomon Brothers notes in his latest European equity
strategy review that bourses had rallied strongly during the first three
months, helped by strong US economic recovery and an appreciating dollar,
and hopes of lower interest rates. At their peak in March and early April,
the markets had risen by an average of 5 to 6 per cent since the start of
the year and had outperformed bond markets.
Since late-March, however, deepening economic recession in continental
Europe, a slower pace of recovery in the US, fears of intervention in Bosnia
and turmoil in the Confederation of Independent States had all weighed
heavily on European equities, offsetting the benefits of the Bundesbank's
easing of monetary policy.
German domestic turnover saw the biggest fall of the month, 32.5 per cent
from March's unusually high levels as worries about the economy grew. Spain
came a close second, down 30.1 per cent as investors became uneasy about the
peseta's outlook, and elections on June 6 which could produce a hung
parliament.
French turnover dipped by 26.2 per cent as bourse indices fell on concern
about the new budget, while Switzerland contracted by 25.9 per cent as the
market underperformed on the weak dollar and impatience over the delay in
bringing down Swiss interest rates.
Italy eased 0.8 per cent from March's four-year record. The market index
rose 10.8 per cent as the political climate looked brighter and investors
refused to be put off by the ever-widening corruption scandal.

FT  20 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei shows mild
recovery amid bargain hunting
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDEX futures sales were outweighed by bargain hunting, government buy
orders and short-covering, and the Nikkei average closed at its intraday
high in light trading, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The Nikkei ended 151.40 firmer at 20,380.79, after a session low of
20,128.70. The Topix index of all first section stocks appreciated 8.68 to
1,597.96. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.56 to 1,229.16.
Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was 380m shares,
barely changed from the previous day. Advances outnumbered declines by 595
to 423, with 167 issues unchanged.
Brokers said investors had been waiting for a possible retreat below the
20,000 level. But once the 225-issue average maintained its ground, buyers
entered the market at the lower end of its range.
An analyst at a Japanese brokerage said domestic institutional investors
dominated the day's activity, with international investors taking light
profits. Equity prices, he added, are expected to trade within a narrow
range until market participants have digested recent company results and
forecasts.
Investors focused on issues with good earnings for the financial year to
March 1993. JGC, the engineering company, rose Y100 to Y2,330 following its
better than expected results.
Takuma, the boilermaker, advanced Y70 to Y1,400 as market participants
speculated that its earnings will reach peak levels.
The non-ferrous metals sector rose in tandem with gold prices in overnight
trading in New York. Sumitomo Metal Mining, the day's most active issue,
climbed Y50 to Y1,160, Mitsubishi Mining and Smelting Y13 to Y558 and
Mitsubishi Material Y3 to Y525.
Some real estate issues advanced after the Japan High Rise Condominiums
Association estimated that condominium sales would increase by more than 50
per cent this current fiscal year. Daikyo put on Y40 at Y1,320 and Nichimo
Y2 at Y557.
However, Honda, which announced a 32 per cent decline in pre-tax profits,
retreated Y50 to Y1,380. Suzuki declined Y14 to Y966.
Profit-taking pushed some shipbuilding issues down following Tuesday's
advance. Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries slipped Y4 to Y517, while
Hitachi Zosen relinquished Y8 to Y575.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 72.11 higher at 22,625.09 in volume of 21.2m
shares.
Roundup
PROFIT-TAKING was much in evidence yesterday.
HONG KONG slipped back following record highs earlier this week. The Hang
Seng index eased 55.42 to 7,093.88. Turnover fell to HKDollars 5.2bn from
Tuesday's HKDollars 8.3bn.
Some analysts commented that the market was likely to consolidate after its
recent rallies, while switching among major stocks and to second and third
liners was also noted.
HSBC Holdings and Cheung Kong were sold, down a respective 50 cents and 10
cents to HKDollars 71.50 and HKDollars 27.10. However, Jardine Matheson went
against the trend, rising HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 58.50.
SINGAPORE was also easier, although the Straits Times Industrial index
recovered from an intraday low of 1,866 to finish only a net 1.40 off at
1,876.61. Volume was estimated at 403.2m shares.
Fraser &amp; Neave and Sembawang Shipyard receded 40 cents apiece to SDollars
12.60 and SDollars 12.40 respectively.
SEOUL, however, went higher for the third consecutive session, with
securities houses giving good performances. Daewoo Securities moved forward
Won300 to Won23,200 and Lucky Securities Won300 to Won20,200.
The composite stock index closed 2.15 firmer at 724.76 in turnover of
Won759.6bn.
TAIWAN fell back as turnover shrank from TDollars 23bn to TDollars 18.5bn,
its lowest level since February. The weighted index lost 48.85 at 4,446.54.
Activity was dampened by concern over investigations into alleged trading
irregularities which are being investigated by the authorities.
MANILA lost ground for the second day running on a combination of
disappointing economic data and a severe power shortage. The composite index
declined 21.78 to 1,574.36 in turnover of 408.6m pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR was firmer, with activity concentrated in blue chips. The
composite index rose 3.97 to 729.43 in turnover of MDollars 1.7bn.
Sime Darby, however, fell 22 cents to MDollars 4.88 in volume of 2.35m
shares.
AUSTRALIA rose in line with an improvement in the gold price. The All
Ordinaries index put on 4.7 at 1,682.6, with the gold shares index advancing
82.0 to 1,798.3, its highest level since March 1990. Turnover came to
ADollars 351m.
NEW ZEALAND was driven higher by Telecom, up 16 cents at NZDollars 2.95, as
investors responded to Tuesday's annual results, which included an increase
in the dividend. The NZSE-40 index gained 27.57 at 1,615.91 in turnover of
NZDollars 67m.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Questions raised on D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK'S weakness in the wake of Denmark's ratification of the
Maastricht treaty was the dominant issue in foreign exchange markets
yesterday, raising speculation that the German currency is on the verge of a
sharp move downwards, writes James Blitz.
Dealers continued to unwind long D-Mark positions in the wake of the Yes
vote in Denmark, pushing the German currency to an historic low against the
Japanese yen, and helping sterling to break through the DM2.50 barrier for
only the second time this year.
Newfound confidence in European monetary union was always bound to weaken
the German currency, which investors had used as a vehicle for hedging
against another crisis in the exchange rate mechanism.
But the surprising aspect of the German currency's weakness yesterday was
that it came on a day when the Bundesbank left interest rates unchanged.
This was contrary to the expectations of many dealers, who had priced a cut
of  1/4 percentage point in the discount rate into their operations.
The yen closed at Y68.04 against the D-Mark from a previous Y68.65, while
sterling appreciated 1 1/2 pfennigs to DM2.5025 in spite of retail sales
figures which raised speculation about a cut in UK base rates this autumn.
There were other hints that the D-Mark's role in fund managers' portfolios
was being reassessed.
A rise in German bond yields to 6.85 per cent implied that there were sharp
flows out of the German currency. Some analysts suggested that zero spreads
between French and German bonds were not inconceivable.
The dollar managed to hold steady against the German currency, in spite of a
day which brought the worst US trade data in four years. The March trade
deficit ballooned by 29 per cent to Dollars 10.2bn, and the deficit with
Japan leaped to a five-year peak. However, the dollar ended in London little
changed at DM1.6235. In New York it closed at DM1.6230.
The German currency gained no strength against the Dutch guilder, in spite
of a 10 basis-point cut in the Dutch central bank's advances rate. At the
close of trading in the exchange rate mechanism, the guilder was 48 basis
points above the D-Mark in the currency grid, almost at the self-imposed
limit of 50 basis points set by the Dutch authorities.
Worse than expected figures for German M3 money supply growth were a strong
factor behind bearishness towards the currency. On an annualised basis,
Germany's M3 money supply grew 7.3 per cent in April, compared to a 3.4 per
cent rise in March.
Mr Steve Hannah of IBJ International in London said there was a clear
message in yesterday's events that the D-Mark was weakening: 'We may be
beginning to see an acceleration of a malaise that will characterise the
D-Mark for the rest of this year.'

FT  20 MAY 93 / Money Markets: Euromarks fall back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN interest rate futures fell sharply yesterday after Germany's latest
money supply figures appeared to be a good deal worse than expected and the
Bundesbank decided not to cut its short-term interest rates, writes James
Blitz.
It was announced first thing yesterday morning that, on an annualised basis,
Germany's M3 money supply had grown by 7.3 per cent in April compared to 3.4
per cent in March.
The headline figure was worse than dealers had expected, leapfrogging over
the Bundesbank's target band of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent annualised monetary
growth.
Some analysts suggested that the underlying monetary growth may not have
been as bad as the headline figure indicated. The higher growth did not
reflect increased private sector or bank lending, but lower long term
savings and increased lending to public authorities, both of which are said
to be rather erratic variables.
Miss Alison Cottrell, an analyst at Midland Global Markets in London,
comm-ented: 'This figure would actually encourage an interest rate cut, not
postpone one.'
In interest rate markets, however, the clear view was that the M3 figure was
the precursor to a more cautious attitude to easing monetary policy by the
Bundesbank.
In the early morning, the June and September Euromark contracts retreated by
10 and 11 basis points respectively, bottoming out at 92.77 and 93.54.
The Bundesbank later decided to keep its Lombard and discount rates
unchanged, in spite of expectations earlier in the week of a modest cut in
the official interest rate floor. Both contracts remained at these low
levels at the close.
Sterling futures markets were a good deal more bullish about a rate
reduction, following another good performance by the pound on the foreign
exchanges and a poorer than expected retail sales figure, which implied that
the UK authorities may still need to stimulate the economy.
The June short sterling contract rose 2 basis points on the day, while the
September contract finished 11 basis points higher at 94.05.
In the cash market, three-month money softened to around 6 per cent from a
previous 6 1/16 per cent. There was a large shortage of Pounds 1.65bn
forecast at the start of the day but it was swiftly despatched.

After last week's price surge in Australia, taking the market indicator up
by 20pc from its low point only two weeks previously, the market there has
given a steadier impression this week. Competition is still good with China,
Taiwan and Japan active as well as the EEC. Prices for most merino fleece
have, however, slipped a little, bringing the market indicator down to
449c/kg on May 19, from 455c/kg at the end of last week. In consuming
countries covering pressure also appears to have subsided somewhat. There
is, nevertheless, confidence that the lowest point of the season has been
passed.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Reconciling economics and
ecology in New England - An area that could benefit from environmental
pressures elsewhere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRY STONE walls running through mature hardwood forest in New England evoke
a powerful picture of the sheer effort needed by the colonists to clear
their new land of both trees and rocks in order to plant crops.
The ruins of a farmstead, complete with rusting implements, overshadowed by
towering red and sugar maple, black cherry, ash, beech, pine and hemlock
also bear witness to the regenerative power of nature. The remains of barbed
wire fences, once wrapped round a sapling, run straight through the centre
of a 14-inch diameter oak.
'There is no virgin forest here. This is all land cut over and used,' says
forester Bruce Jacobs, president of New Hampshire-based Fountain Forestry,
which looks after 150,000 acres of US forest land, mostly in New England. He
reckons that the potential of the second-growth north-eastern forests of the
US as a source of hardwood has been overlooked at a time when US timber
exports are booming and environmental concerns are reducing supplies.
The most visible example of environmental pressures has been the battle over
the endangered spotted owl, which last month took up several hours of
President Clinton's time in Portland, Oregon.
'We'll get some of the action because of the spotted owl,' says Mr Jacobs,
who says that protecting the species will locks up 12 to 14 per cent of the
Pacific north-west's timber, and will have a big impact on the US domestic
market. Already timber from the north-east is being sold in Chicago, which
used to take all its construction timber from the west coast.
The abandonment of the farms in New England followed the Civil War and the
opening up of the American west. A century and a half ago 70 to 80 per cent
of Vermont was open, but now between 80 and 85 per cent is wooded again.
A time-travelling Indian would find the mix of species in the forest exactly
the same as it was several hundred years ago. But he would wonder what had
happened to the giant white pine, which was relentlessly cut down to supply
masts for the battling navies of Europe. While the white pine is readily
found, none have been around the 200 years or so necessary to reach 150 feet
high and 3 feet in diameter.
That is not surprising considering the region's first saw mill started to
operate in Maine early in the 17th century. Timber harvesting has not
stopped since - and a white pine reaches its maximum commercial value after
only 80 years.
In upper New York state about 40 per cent of the Adirondack mountains is now
managed by the state as wilderness. Apart from the maintenance of trails,
the forest is left alone, and presumably some white pines will once again
reach 200 years of age. But most of the rest of the land is in private hands
and the owners want to make it pay.
Mr Jacobs argues that it is possible both to make a profit from timber and
to conserve the forest for hunting and leisure purposes. About 25 per cent
of the entire US population is within a day's drive of the north-eastern
forests.
The most profitable hardwood in the New England forests is black cherry,
which produces beautiful timber for furniture manufacture. If left alone the
black cherry reaches maturity in 80 years, although management of the forest
can shorten the time to 65 years. It is fetching Dollars 250 to Dollars 350
per 1,000 board feet at present, although a tree suitable for producing
veneer can fetch up to Dollars 2,000 per 1,000 board feet.
But the difference in price between the top value trees and those that can
be used only for pulp is considerable. Pulped hardwood, which is needed for
top quality paper such as that used in glossy magazines, fetches Dollars 3
to Dollars 5 a cord (a cord is a stack 4ft by 4ft by 8ft). It takes about 25
6-inch diameter trees to make a cord - valuing each tree at only a few
cents.
In surveying for good prospective forest land, Mr Jacobs will look for
timber that is at the pulpwood stage, but on the verge of reaching saw log
stage. 'You can buy at 20 cents a tree, and 30 years later you have
potentially a tree worth Dollars 200 to Dollars 300,' he says. 'You also
still have the land.'
However, this means taking a long-term view. Many owners succumb to the
temptation to take out all the best timber in one go, leaving the next
harvest 60 to 70 years away. As Mr Jacobs points out: 'It's very difficult
to really hurt the forest from a biological view, but very easy to hurt in
terms of economic value'.

<TEXT>
New York raw SUGAR prices remained broadly lower at midday after a steep
late morning drop, but the emergence of trade buying and an easing of
technical selling allowed prices to move well off their two-week lows,
traders said. Analysts said fundamentals remained bullish. That was
underscored by the International Sugar Organisation's estimate for the
1992-93 world production deficit at 1.61m tonnes. New York arabica COFFEE
prices erased moderate morning losses to stand slightly firmer at midday.
The early sell-off came as profit taking emerged after Tuesday's rise of
3.45 cents a lb. Sales were also prompted by news that the Green Coffee
Association had revised downwards by more than 50 per cent the decrease in
US coffee warehouse stocks in April. On the LME COPPER ended the afternoon
kerb little changed, with the mood indecisive and many traders looking to
buy dips and sell rallies. There appeared to be solid resistance around
Dollars 1,820-Dollars 1,830 a tonne for three-month metal and support below
Dollars 1,800. Other metals were little changed - many appeared to be
entering consolidation phases, dealers said.

TRINIDAD AND Tobago's nitrogenous fertiliser output slipped 4 per cent last
year to 2.36m tonnes, mainly because of plant closures for maintenance, the
country's central bank has reported. Exports by the Caribbean state, a major
supplier to the US and western Europe, were 2.08m tonnes, marginally less
than in 1991.
Government officials say the country is now among the world's largest
producers of nitrogenous fertilisers with installed capacity of 2.5m tonnes
per year.
Last month the government sold its wholly owned urea plant and its 51 per
cent stake in an ammonia plant to Arcadian Partners of Tennessee, a major
producer of fertilisers, for USDollars 175m.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Passions run high over Canadian
forest - An increasingly bitter battle between fellers and conservationists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE for British Columbia's majestic cedar, hemlock and Douglas fir
trees is being waged with especial ferocity over a scenic web of forests and
waterways on the west coast of Vancouver Island, known as Clayoquot Sound.
The passions were evident last weekend when police arrested three people
suspected of setting fire to a bridge leading to the forests. Environmental
activists have been blamed for several other acts of violence. Another
bridge was destroyed by arson two years ago and on the night that the town
council of Tofino, the community closest to the sound, voted to support
logging in the area earlier this year a fishing boat on the local beach was
set on fire.
Fearing another outbreak of violence, the Vancouver police were out in force
last month at the hotel where MacMillan Bloedel, one of two companies at the
centre of the Clayoquot Sound storm, held its annual meeting.
Radical environmental groups have already threatened to 'spike' trees in the
Clayoquot Sound forests with metal stakes this summer. The spikes pose a
serious hazard to loggers and diminish a tree's commercial value.
British Columbia's social-democrat government tried to defuse the tensions
in mid-April by spelling out a compromise which met some, but not all, the
demands of logging companies and their workers on the one hand, and
conservationists on the other.
But the battle for Clayoquot Sound is far from over.
MacMillan Bloedel expects to be bogged down for at least a year in
negotiating the details of how it will cut down the trees that the
government has agreed to set aside for commercial logging. Mr Dan Miller,
British Columbia's forests minister, concurs that 'it will take some time
for the companies to design these plans and to submit them to us for
approval'.
The conservationists, for their part, plan to fight MacMillan Bloedel and
International Forest, the other company whose cutting licence includes
Clayoquot Sound, every step of the way. 'We will watch everything and
challenge everything,' says Ms Vicki Husband, director of the Sierra Club of
Western Canada and one of the sharpest thorns in the side of the British
Columbian forestry industry.
The province's government last monthasked a senior judge to examine
allegations that it created a conflict of interest by buying a sizeable
block of MacMillan Bloedel shares at the same time as it was coming to a
decision on Clayoquot Sound.
The forests of the 262,000-hectare sound are not only important in
themselves to both sides but also epitomise the wider questions in the
debate on forestry and the environment: to what extent should trees be cut
down to maintain jobs and investments in forests and saw-mills? Or should
the forests be preserved entirely for wildlife, environmentalists and
tourists?
MacMillan Bloedel says the sound would provide about 10 per cent of the
annual feedstock required by its mills at nearby Port Alberni. The company
already faces reductions of up to 14 per cent in tree-cutting licences for
other provincially-owned forests supplying the Alberni mills.
The timber industry also worries that the wrangle at Clayoquot Sound is part
of a developing pattern of endless negotiation, harassment and,
increasingly, violence which have come to bedevil logging operations across
the west coast of North America.
More than two years ago, the provincial government divided the nearby - and
equally picturesque - Carmanah Valley between working forests and wilderness
areas. But operations there remain suspended as the authorities and the
companies haggle over detailed working plans.
Environmental activists see it differently. Ms Husband describes Clayoquot
Sound as 'a very rare and valuable eco-system', which is one of the biggest
original temperate rain forests remaining along the west coast.
Armed with detailed maps, she demonstrates how logging has denuded
old-growth forests on Vancouver Island. 'They've raped and pillaged, to put
it mildly,' Ms Husband says.
Under the government's mid-April decision, about a third of the sound would
be permanently off-limits to commercial forestry. Some 45 per cent would be
available for logging, while 17 per cent would be 'special management areas'
where especially strict tree-cutting rules would apply to protect scenic
corridors, wildlife habitats and recreation areas.
The government has promised to ensure that harvesting is carried out
'sustainably'. It plans, for instance, to restrict the size of clear-cuts,
insist on greater use of helicopters to carry out felled logs and to set
aside substantial buffer zones between tourist areas and logging activity.
The cost of cutting trees in Clayoquot Sound is thus likely to be high. The
companies warn that this may encourage such undesirable practices as
'high-grading', in which only the most valuable trees are removed. None the
less, MacMillan Bloedel is satisfied that the government's decision is the
best it could realistically hope for.
Mr Patrick Armstrong, a consultant whose clients include several British
Columbian forestry companies, says that it 'is a win for the forest sector
if you put it in the context of the times, the issues and the pressures that
were being applied'.
But the government has promised to double the area of land set aside for
parks and wildlife refuges to 12 per cent of the province. Mr Armstrong
echoes the industry's concern that the tug-of-war over Clayoquot could be
the forerunner of a multitude of similar battles.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fresh surge takes gold to
highest since Gulf War
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER FRENZIED day in the gold market yesterday saw the US dollar price
rise at one point in the morning to Dollars 384.50 a troy ounce, its highest
level since the panic buying just after the start of the Gulf War in
January, 1991.
Traders said profit-taking by investment funds after the New York market
opened pulled back the price in the afternoon and it closed in London at
Dollars 377.15, up Dollars 6.90 an ounce or by nearly 2 per cent from
Tuesday's close.
Gold's price slumped to a seven-year low of Dollars 327 an ounce in London
on the first trading day of 1993. The rise during the past four weeks,
inspired by high-profile investors Sir James Goldsmith and Mr George Soros,
has taken the price up by 15 per cent.
Dealers warned that the frantic conditions might re-appear today because
many countries observe Ascension Day - including Germany, Switzerland and
South Africa - and that could create a thin and volatile market.
Analysts' reaction to gold's sudden upward surge was predictably mixed
yesterday. Enthusiastic bulls suggested the price still had a long way to go
and that the upward momentum would continue to be reflected in gold company
share prices. 'Don't let the grass grow under your feet while you are
pondering your next move in gold shares,' said Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord
Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group. 'Gold's pauses for breath are
turning out to be very short indeed - more akin to the urgency of a Grand
Prix pit stop than a lazy afternoon siesta.'
But an official at Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, the world's
biggest gold producer, told Reuter that the demand which had boosted prices
recently appeared to have come from a fairly small speculative community
which could be unable to sustain prices at present levels.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Review cuts cost estimate for
Papua New Guinea mine project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN URGENT review of the capital costs needed to bring the Lihir Island gold
project in Papua New Guinea into production has resulted in 'a sizeable
reduction' from the USDollars 767m previously expected and improved the
economics, said Mr Geoff Loudon, chairman of Niugini Mining, one of the
partners in the project, yesterday.
However, Mr Loudon said he had no idea whether the improvement would
encourage RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining group, which has a
majority stake in Lihir, to go ahead. All RTZ would say is: 'We are
continuing studies to improve the economics'.
Lihir, in the crater of a dead volcano nearly full of very hot water, is the
world's biggest undeveloped gold deposit with resources of about 42m troy
ounces of gold. It is expected that it will produce 628,000 ounces annually
in its first 13 years. The PNG government, which will take 30 per cent of
the project, reducing RTZ's stake to 56 per cent and Niugini's to 14 per
cent, is keen for mining to go ahead quickly and has been putting pressure
on RTZ for a decision.
RTZ wants to reduce its exposure to the project on which USDollars 135m has
been spent so far - Mr Loudon described that group's attitude as 'somewhat
lacking in enthusiasm' - and has been seeking another partner to take a 20
per cent stake. The PNG government has given RTZ until today to complete the
search or it will temporarily take 50 per cent of the project so as to speed
up the funding process.
Mr Loudon, in London yesterday, pointed out that the PNG government had no
intention of keeping the extra 20 per cent because the country would find it
difficult to finance half the project. Its ultimatum to RTZ should be seen
as part of a broader negotiating process.
He admitted it was a matter of concern to him than some big gold groups had
apparently looked at the project 'and not grabbed the 20 per cent'. He was
personally in favour of Niugini Mining taking the extra 20 per cent offered
by RTZ but had not been able to persuade his board to take the opportunity.
Niugini is 55 per cent owned by Battle Mountain Gold of the US.
A 1990 study put the capital cost of the Lihir project at USDollars 1.1bn
but in 1991 this was revised in a way that not only cut capital costs but
also increased cash flow in the early years of production. However, gold
output would be cut considerably in later years.
Mr Loudon yesterday would not give precise details but said the latest cost
review, which would be completed within a week, looked at the possibility of
employing a mining contractor and saving the USDollars 60m in the Lihir
budget for mining equipment. At present the cost of hiring contractors was
very low.
Also the Dollars 68m 'cost escalation' figure in the budget gave room for
manoeuvre as it originally assumed annual inflation of 4 per cent over the
33 months to bring the mine into production. Inflation was now expected to
be below that level and much of the equipment was to be acquired in
Australia, so the fall of the Australian dollar against the US currency was
also cutting projected costs.
Mr Loudon revealed that the PNG government had agreed that the Lihir project
would pay no duty on fuel while the gold price was below USDollars 380 a
troy ounce (a level that was exceeded yesterday for the first time in two
years). The partners were also asking for concessions on import duties on
equipment but the government was insisting it could not afford to lose the
revenue.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts strengthen after a stream of
favourable data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A confluence of favourable factors drove up the UK government bond market,
with gilts in the next auction area performing particularly strongly.
The welcome given to Tuesday's Bank of England announcement on the Pounds
3bn auction carried over into yesterday morning's trade. Then weak retail
sales figures for April, a monthly PSBR total at the low end of expectations
and the strengthening pound all fuelled further advances.
More bullish factors for the market are expected in today's labour market
data - a resumed rise in unemployment is forecast - and in tomorrow's
release of the retail prices index.
The consensus forecasts on the RPI are for an historically low 'headline'
rate of 1.5 per cent and just over 3 per cent for underlying annual growth.
This chimes with sanguine comments on inflation in the Bank of England's
quarterly survey.
Gilts responded with a half-point rise at the longer end, notably the 8 1/2
per cent due 2007.
The 'when issued' price of the auction stock - 7 3/4 per cent due 2006  -
gained just over  3/8 of a point to close at 30 3/16 partly paid (95 3/16
all in).
BY contrast, it was a bad day for the German government bond market.
The Yes vote in the Danish referendum set the background for further
weakening of Germany's safe-haven image and continued outflows of cash to
the high yielders.
However, the body blow to bunds came with the April M3 money supply figures,
which leapt 7.3 per cent - well beyond expectations and the Bundesbank's 6.5
per cent target ceiling.
After this shock, a little comfort was drawn from the central bank's
decision not to lower either of its key interest rates.
This was seen as giving some support for the sagging D-Mark.
Another problem was the string of recent issues in the 10-year area.
The latest, this week's ERP, was reported to be difficult to sell. One
economist commented that investors were waiting for the yield on 10-year
stock to rise to 7 per cent.
NOT surprisingly, one of the main beneficiaries of bund weakness was
Denmark, where there was also a 1 point cut in the discount and repo rates
to 8.25 per cent and 8.75 per cent respectively.
The uplift in government bonds saw the yield spread of Danish 10-year bonds
over bunds fall to 61 basis points. It has come down from 85 basis points
little more than a fortnight ago.
The Italian market made further gains, still buoyed by news of rapid
withholding tax rebates and budget deficit cuts.
With the yield spread over bunds still higher than at the time of the Danish
No vote last June, further gains were seen as a possibility.
US Treasury prices rallied strongly at the long end of the market yesterday
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  17/32 at 101
7/8 , yielding 6.971 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was up  3/32 at 99 25/32 , to yield 3.975 per cent.
After two days of yields holding steady at the short end but rising
significantly at the long end, the strong performance of the long bond
yesterday reversed the steepening in the yield curve.
Initially, prices at the long end eased slightly, primarily in reaction to
an unexpected jump in imports revealed in the March merchandise trade
report. The rise in imports raised fears that domestic demand might be
rising sharply although analysts later attributed much of the rise to
stronger demand for petroleum products.
Later in the day, a sudden drop in gold prices cheered bond investors, as
did the absence of any sign from the Federal Reserve of a shift in the
emphasis of monetary policy.
AFTER Tuesday's torrid selling of Japanese government bonds, the market had
a much calmer day.
However, buyers continued to sit on their hands in Tokyo trading, leaving
the September futures contract to weaken to 106.08 from 106.24 and giving
little support to the No 145 10-year cash benchmark, which closed at 4.665
per cent.
In London trading there was some recovery as the yen strengthened against
the dollar.

FT  20 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Russian Treasury bill to ease
budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian authorities yesterday hailed their first Treasury bill issue as
a first step to helping finance the budget deficit by means other than
printing money.
Mr Dimitry Tulin, deputy governor of the central bank, said the sale of
Rbs885.4m marked 'the birth of a new market in our country for credit
instruments'.
The first issue, which is small in contrast to Russia's budget deficit, is
to be followed by monthly auctions of bigger amounts.
The three-month bills were sold at around 84.7 per cent of their par value,
with an average annual yield of 103 per cent. This is far below inflation,
which exceeds 1,000 per cent a year, but still attractive to commercial
banks which have to keep vast amounts of idle funds to make up for a slow
banking payments system.
The central bank payments system can also hold on for weeks to
rapidly-depreciating roubles owed to exporters who may therefore also be
attracted by the liquidity of the bills.
Mr Tulin said commercial banks had Rbs3,000bn in idle funds and that half
that amount might be invested in Treasury bills if the new instrument was
proved to be reliable.

FT  20 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Bank opts for a conciliatory
tone on derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England's internal report on derivatives, published yesterday,
adopted a broadly conciliatory tone towards the derivatives industry, in
contrast to the forcefully expressed concerns of some other regulators.
The internal working group was chaired by Mr Richard Farrant, a deputy head
of banking supervision, and included a representative of the Securities and
Futures Authority (SFA).
The report recommended that at least two members of the board (including the
finance director) of any institution should be sufficiently knowledgeable to
ensure that the business was controlled effectively.
This policy would be adopted by the Bank, an official said. Concern about
the lack of understanding of derivatives at board level echoed the Promisel
report by the Bank for International Settlements, published in October 1992,
which prompted the Bank of England to set up the internal working group.
The Bank of England report recommended further research on the relative
price volatility and liquidity of cash and derivatives markets, exploring
the links between financial markets, and the level of systemic risk.
The Bank, the SFA and the Securities and Investment Board are discussing
ways of pursuing this research.
The Bank pointed to a need for more data on derivatives markets, and is
considering establishing a survey of the derivatives markets comparable to
that already conducted for forex activity.
On the issue of market risk, the Bank warned that the limitations of models
needed to be understood by supervisors.
Another area of concern was that some large unregulated institutions
operated in the derivatives market, as a result of regulatory gaps.
Meanwhile, a wide-ranging study of the risks associated with derivative
products is expected to be released in the next month or so by the Group of
Thirty, the Washington-based think-tank. Sir Dennis Weatherstone, chairman
of JP Morgan, is heading the G30 study group.

FT  20 MAY 93 / International Bonds: Denmark three-year issue struggles in
spite of Yes vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK'S hopes of catching a wave of enthusiasm following Tuesday's Yes
vote on the Maastricht treaty were dashed, due to the widespread perception
that the Kingdom's Ecu250m three-year issue was priced too tightly.
The deal, arranged by Morgan Stanley, offered a yield of seven or eight
basis points below the yield of the UK's three-year Ecu notes.
Given that the UK is a AAA credit, while Denmark's debt is a notch lower at
AA1/AA+, the issue was considered over-aggressive, even though the target
audience of European retail investors often focus on coupon rather than
yield spread.
However, Morgan Stanley pointed out that the UK notes were trading at a
premium of several points to their par value, which for three-year paper
represented several basis points in yield.
However, the pricing was not the only problem: the Ecu bond market, instead
of rallying on the news of the referendum result, appeared to have fully
discounted the event, and was hit by a brief spell of profit-taking.
A number of banks turned down invitations to underwrite the issue. They
described the deal as 'far too tight' and 'the last thing the market
needed'.
However, Mr Michael Dee, head of debt syndicate at Morgan Stanley, defended
the decision to launch the issue.
'The Ecu market continues to be technically in good shape, and we are
confident in doing a deal that others consider aggressive,' he said.
He added that he expected the deal to be placed with continental European
retail investors.
Denmark is using the proceeds of the offering to refinance an existing
Ecu250m issue of 7 5/8 per cent bonds due 1996, which are now callable.
In the sterling convertible bond market, Allied Lyons' Dollars 200m issue of
subordinated convertible bonds met reasonable demand from continental
European investors, who have been the mainstay of the recent increase of
activity in the market.
The conversion price, set at 622p, 17.8 per cent above the current share
price, was in line with other recent offerings.
However, dealers said that the wave of supply in the sector had eroded some
of the initial enthusiasm, which had been fuelled by positive sentiment on
sterling, as well as the outlook for UK equities.
In the asset-backed sector, a further Pounds 108m of bonds backed by vehicle
hire purchase receivables of Chartered Trust was issued by CARS 2, a special
purpose vehicle.
ABN AMRO Holding is planning to issue its first deal in the Yankee bond
market, a Dollars 250m, 30-year subordinated issue.

YAMAHA, the world's largest maker of musical instruments, yesterday reported
a 58.7 per cent plunge to Y2.8bn (Dollars 25m) in pre-tax profits, prompting
the victors in a recent boardroom coup to intensify a restructuring
programme.
Sales during the year ending in March fell 14 per cent to Y330bn. However,
the company estimated that the fall was only 3.9 per cent if the transfer of
its housing equipment division to a subsidiary was taken into account.
However, sales of most mainstream products, including pianos, electronic
instruments, and sports equipment, were lower, and the company said the fall
in interest rates during the period reduced financial income.
Three generations of family rule at Yamaha ended in March when Mr Hiroshi
Kawakami, the grandson of the founder, was removed from the board after the
company's union demanded that executives took responsibility for
deteriorating profits.
Profits have slipped for three successive years, and the company is
expecting the fall to continue this year, forecasting a pre-tax profit of
Y2.5bn, down 10 per cent, on sales of Y336bn, a slim 1.6 per cent higher.
The company's labour union may have played an important role in ending the
reign of the Kawakami family, but one of the new leadership's most pressing
tasks is to cut the workforce.
Aiwa, the audio equipment maker, reported a 33 per cent fall in pre-tax
profit to Y2.9bn, in spite of an 11 per cent increase in operating profit,
with the difference due to exchange rate losses and reduced financial
income.
Sales rose 6.8 per cent to Y161.6bn, including a 3.5 per cent increase in
audio equipment and a 25 per cent rise in video equipment, which accounted
for about 17 per cent of total sales.
Domestic sales fell by almost 5 per cent, but exports were 10 per cent
higher, due to strong demand from east Asian countries.
For the current year, Aiwa forecast a pre-tax profit almost unchanged at
Y3bn on sales of Y170bn, a 5 per cent increase on last year.

FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Two KIO Swiss bank accounts
frozen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO SWISS BANK accounts belonging to the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO), the
overseas investment arm of the Kuwaiti finance ministry, have been frozen by
a Geneva judge following a petition by the Italian cardboard producer,
Sarrio.
The attachment of the accounts is a significant victory for Sarrio, which is
suing the KIO in Spain for non-payment of part of the price of assets sold
to the KIO's Spanish subsidiary, Grupo Torras (GT), in 1991.
The Italians accepted shares in Torras Papel, a GT subsidiary, as partial
payment for their Spanish paper interests, with the agreement that these
shares could be 'put' back to GT in three instalments.
The Kuwaitis paid the first instalment but new managers, who took over the
KIO last May, have not, says Sarrio, made the second and third payments. The
value of the shares held by Sarrio has since collapsed. GT is in
receivership.
Sarrio applied for, and won, an attachment order in Switzerland on May 11.
The accounts affected are at Lombard Odier, the private bank, and the Swiss
Kuwaiti Bank.
It is not known how much money is now in the accounts.
Sarrio is trying to retrieve SFr112m (Dollars 76.7m) and the KIO is likely
to ask that at least one of the accounts be unfrozen in the meantime.
The move by Sarrio could pose a serious threat to the Kuwaitis, however. If
Sarrio is allowed to retrieve the money it wants from one or other of the
accounts it might create a judicial precedent and allow other GT creditors
to make claims directly from the KIO.
The KIO's lawyers are understood to feel the retrieval attempt will fail,
however. The KIO claims it is merely a shareholder, and not the owner, of
GT.

FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Product recalls drive Matsushita
unit into loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MATSUSHITA Refrigeration, the home refrigerator subsidiary of the Matsushita
group, yesterday reported a net loss of Y28.9bn (Dollars 259m), after having
been forced to book extraordinary losses for the recall of defective
products, writes Robert Thomson.
The loss, after a Y4bn profit a year ago, was the first since its listing in
1955, and was cited as one of the causes for the recent boardroom reshuffle
in the parent company.
Sales for the year slipped 13 per cent to Y176bn as domestic demand for
consumer goods was unusually weak.
But the most important reason for the red ink in the year to March was a
special charge of Y31.4bn linked to the recall of about 420,000
refrigerators with flawed compressors. As a result, executive bonuses are to
be cut by 30 per cent this year.
The company, which also makes vending machines and air conditioners, managed
a pre-tax profit of Y145m, but there was an operating loss of Y4.6bn.
Makita, the leading Japanese maker of electric tools, said pre-tax profit
fell 6 per cent to Y12.6bn in the year to March, while sales fell 4.5 per
cent, the first fall in 30 years.
The company blamed the appreciation of the yen and the slowing of the
domestic economy for the downturn in sales, which totalled Y123bn, while it
has also been troubled by a US anti-dumping action on Japanese hand tools.
Demand is strongest from the rapid-growth countries of south-east Asia, but
the company expects that sales this year will fall 12 per cent to Y108bn,
while pre-tax profit is forecast to fall 35 per cent to Y8.2bn.
Consolidated sales were 0.8 per cent higher at Y178.9bn, and pre-tax profit
was down 5.7 per cent at Y20.2bn.

FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Woolworths aims for ADollars
2.45bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WOOLWORTHS, the Austra-lian retailing group, will go public next month in
the country's biggest corporate flotation, seeking up to ADollars 2.45bn
(USDollars 1.69bn)without an underwriter.
The chairman of Woolworths, Mr Paul Simons, launched the long-awaited
flotation yesterday, with forecasts of continued strong earnings and sales
growth, against the national retailing trend.
Mr Simons ended months of speculation, revealing that the flotation would
offer 1bn shares at a price between ADollars 2.15 and ADollars 2.45, to be
determined by an institutional tendering process.
The flotation will be in four parts, with the biggest proportion of nearly
49 per cent offered on a non-renounceable basis to shareholders in
Woolworths' parent companies, Adelaide Steamship, David Jones, and Tooth and
Co. These companies were all formerly part of the corporate empire run by Mr
John Spalvins.
A further 30 per cent of the shares will be offered to institutional
investors, 1 per cent will be reserved for staff, and the rest will go to
individuals.
Shares not taken up in either the entitlement or employee offers will be
available to institutions or the public. Mr Simons said the public offer
would begin on June 9 and remain open for one month.
Trading in Woolworths shares is expected to begin on July 12 on a deferred
delivery basis, representing the first time the Australian Stock Exchange
has allowed trading to begin before scrip delivery.
Despite strong publicity surrounding the flotation, some observers were
surprised at the lack of both an underwriter and rights trading, especially
as the vendors were forced to delay the flotation in 1992 after share
markets weakened.
The prospectus states that if applications, bids and indications of interest
are not received for all of the shares offered, 'the vendor has resolved
that the sale of shares will not proceed'.
Mr Simons said yesterday that the board predicted a 14 per cent advance in
Woolworths' earnings before interest and tax to ADollars 278.9m for the
current year and a further 11 per cent rise to ADollars 310.2m for next
year.
After-tax earnings were forecast at ADollars 166.3m in the current year,
rising to ADollars 188.5m next year, representing a prospective
price-earnings multiple of just over 13 at the highest possible flotation
price of ADollars 2.45 a share.
The prospectus forecasts a final dividend of 6 cents a share this year and
an annual dividend of 12 cents a share next year, representing a yield of
just under 5 per cent at the maximum flotation price.
A forecast pro-forma balance sheet estimates core debt of the floated entity
at ADollars 258m, rising to ADollars 333m by mid-1994. Bank credit
facilities totalling ADollars 420m have been arranged.

FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Troubled Honda seeks a mass
market formula - Moves to escape a niche
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN officials of Honda assemble today at the company's headquarters in
Tokyo's fashionable Aoyama district to unveil a new passenger car, they will
be investing more hope than usual in their latest offering to help reverse
the company's sagging fortunes.
Honda has just announced a 32 per cent decline in pre-tax profits and a 61
per cent fall in net income for the year to March, and warned that trading
in the current year was likely to be at least as bad.
The Japanese motor manufacturer, which began production at a new factory in
the UK last autumn, expects demand to remain weak in its main markets and
the yen's sharp appreciation to result in a 40 per cent decline in
consolidated net income this year.
Honda officials do not see light at the end of the tunnel yet, and are
battening down for a tumultuous year ahead.
Capital investment is being kept at about half the level of its 1990 peak,
profit-related bonuses for board members are being cut by 10 per cent, and
recruitment of graduates will be nearly halved next April.
These steps come in addition to a restructuring programme introduced three
years ago which has already streamlined operations and cut costs
significantly. But these defensive measures, while effective in getting the
company into better shape to meet the challenges of a severely depressed and
increasingly competitive motor industry, have failed to solve Honda's
overriding problem -its inability to make sufficient profits on cars.
Operating income from car production last year declined by 62 per cent to
Y49.2bn (Dollars 443m) and the outlook for improvement does not look
promising. Income from cars is now only slightly more than that from
motorcycles.
Honda, once a symbol of Japanese innovation and a company that built
America's most popular car for the three years until the last, increasingly
seems to have everything going against it.
In the US, where it has had spectacular success with its mass-market Accord,
the prospects remain uncertain for all car manufacturers and for Honda in
particular.
It has been losing market share in the US where it estimates its slice has
fallen from 9.8 per cent in 1991 to 9.3 per cent last year and 7.5 per cent
in the first four months of 1993.
Competition from a revitalised and much stronger 'big three', as well as
from its Japanese competitors, has intensified. Last year, Honda's Accord
lost the title of best-selling car to Ford's Taurus.
The Accord, its main profit-earner, is due for a model change later this
year and, like any car coming to the end of its model cycle, has been
selling less well than in the past.
At the same time, the company, which is 67 per cent dependent on exports for
revenues, is being battered by the sharp appreciation of the yen.
The yen's rise in the year to March shaved Y70bn off its revenues. While
unit sales of cars in North America declined nearly 17 per cent, in value
terms they were 47 per cent down at Y1,542bn, after falling 52 per cent in
1991-92.
In the domestic market, where car sales fell nearly 8 per cent, Honda faces
the same problem with its Accord, which saw sales fall by about 29 per cent
last year.
Honda's problems lie largely from its dependence on the US market and a
narrow product range that stems from its origins as a niche market
manufacturer.
These qualities served it well when demand in the US market was firm and the
huge popularity of the Accord made up for its relative lack of other
offerings with mass appeal.
But they have been a big stumbling block as changes in the US market, the
high yen and increased competition have eroded what advantages it had as a
focused company with a head-start over other Japanese manufacturers.
Honda is hoping that the launch of new models, such as the mid-range Integra
which is being unveiled today, and a new Accord later this year, will help
stimulate demand.
It believes it has a formula for success in cost-cutting measures which have
helped it to add value to products without adding to the price.
Honda is also confident the restructuring will begin to show results ahead
of others in the industry. The motorcycle division, for example, has doubled
operating income to Y45.3bn since it was made a separate business division.
But that cannot make up for the fall in car revenues as the unit price of
motorcycles is so much smaller, says Mr Koji Endo, an analyst at SG Warburg.
'Honda is not a full-line maker, but neither is it a niche manufacturer any
longer,' Mr Endo says. Its current size means that 'it probably can't go
back to being a niche player'.
If so, Honda's chances of making a comeback depend largely on whether it can
hold its own against its big rivals.
That, Mr Endo believes, depends to a large degree on whether the new Accord,
its most popular mass market car and main profit earner, can attract enough
demand after it is launched this autumn to offset what is expected to be a
very slow period until then.

pressure

<TEXT>
KURABO Industries, a leading Japanese textile company, reported an 87.5 per
cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y230m (Dollars 2.1m) for the year to March,
reflecting the harsh times facing the industry, which is under assault from
imports from China and other Asian countries. Sales fell 9.6 per cent to
Y130.5bn.
The company is hoping profits will increase to Y500m this year, butadmits
that sales will be flat. A rationalisation programme will continue.
The company is attempting to diversify into areas such as information
systems and chemicals, but the slowing of the Japanese economy has put these
businesses under extreme pressure.
Meanwhile Shikibo, a cotton spinner, reported a pre-tax loss of Y4.4bn, less
than the previous period's loss of Y5.4bn, but another sign of the distress
in the industry, which is pressing the government to impose controls on
imports.
Six members of the Shikibo board have resigned and new heads appointed for
its property, textile, industrial material, and business development
divisions. The board was cut from 14 to 10 members.
Sales were down 11.8 per cent to Y68.4bn, and are forecast to fall further
to Y64bn this year. A pre-tax loss of Y3bn is expected.

POWER Corp of Canada, with nearly CDollars 1bn (USDollars 700m) of cash and
short-term investments, is considering several new projects in the US, says
Mr Paul Desmarais, chairman.
In all, Power Corp and Pargesa, the jointly-owned European holding company,
have cash resources totalling CDollars 2.5bn and very low debt, Mr Desmarais
said.
'We're making satisfactory progress reinvesting these liquid resources, and
areas of interest also take in Europe, Asia and Latin America.'
Power Corp plans a joint-venture industrial park in China and later may
enter the life insurance business there.
Its first-quarter net profit fell to CDollars 29.6m, or 23 cents a share,
from CDollars 39.2m, or 30 cents, a year earlier. The decline was mainly due
to reduced special gains on Pargesa asset sales.

GTE, the largest local US telephone company, yesterday announced plans to
sell approximately 500,000 access lines in a total of nine states, to
Citizens Utilities, a diversified utilities group based in Connecticut, for
Dollars 1.1bn in cash.
The deal is part of GTE's previously-announced strategy of trading or
selling domestic local-exchange properties. Last December, the telephone
company said that, 'as a logical step following the merger with Contel', it
planned to discard a small percentage of these properties, allowing it to
concentrate on core markets.
At that stage, GTE said it planned to sell less than 5 per cent of its
domestic access-line base, which then comprised more than 16m lines.
The deal announced yesterday involves all of GTE's local-exchange properties
in Arizona, Montana, New York, Tennessee, Utah and West Virginia.
It also includes a portion of GTE's interests in California (less than 1 per
cent of the access lines there), Idaho (about 14 per cent) and Oregon (less
than 2 per cent). It is subject to various regulatory approvals, and the
transaction is unlikely to be fully completed until 1994.
GTE shares closed up Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 35 1/8 yesterday, while
Citizens Utilities 'B' shares were unchanged at Dollars 36.
Citizens, which like GTE is based in Stamford, supplies electric, gas,
water, and telecommunications services to customers in 13 states. Telecoms
have accounted for about one-third of the group's revenues to date, and the
utility currently operates all-digital local-exchange carriers in Arizona,
California and Pennsylvania.
'Two-and-a-half years ago, we told Citizens' shareholders that we planned to
double the size of the company by 1996,' said Mr Leonard Tow, Citizens'
chairman. 'This transaction goes a long way to meeting that goal.'

FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Golden opportunities go begging
 -Minorco's plans for expansion are thwarted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Hank Slack does not try to hide his disappointment. As chief executive of
Minorco, he was ready to spend about Dollars 1bn cash on two acquisitions
aimed at turning his businesses into one of the world's biggest mining
groups.
But both prospects slipped from Minorco's grasp.
Mr Slack's goal was to transform Minorco, until 1988 a sleepy offshore
investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation-De Beers group of South
Africa, by reorganising its portfolio, shaking-up or turfing out existing
operations and buying new ones.
Many analysts suggest, however, that until recently the process has been
painfully slow and not particularly impressive. Minorco's market rating said
it all: its share price has languished at a 30 to 40 per cent discount to
asset values.
The two big opportunities would certainly have changed market perceptions.
Minorco was offered the chance to join the world-class copper producers when
British Petroleum agreed to sell it 49 per cent of the Olympic Dam mine in
South Australia for Dollars 240m, plus Dollars 190m to repay loans.
But Western Mining, the Australian group which had the majority stake in
Olympic Dam, had pre-emptive rights to the BP stake. It kept Minorco in
suspense for four months before deciding to exercise those rights.
All might not be lost, however. Mr Hugh Morgan, managing director of
Western, has invited the Minorco chief to bring a team to look over Olympic
Dam. Analysts suggest this could mean an invitation to a piece of the
action.
Minorco's other disappointment involved Gold Fields Mining Corporation which
the group hoped to buy from Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate.
GFMC would have been merged with Minorco's Independence Mining subsidiary to
become one of North America's top 10 gold producers.
Hanson opted instead for an asset swap, handing over GFMC to Santa Fe
Pacific in exchange for the US group's coal and aggregate operations.
Mr Slack says Minorco is still looking for more gold opportunities, but that
'the prices being asked are still very fancy'.
Most analysts suggest Minorco paid a 'fancy' price indeed for Independence
Mining, which it bought for Dollars 705m from Freeport McMoRan of the US in
1990. There was, however, an important reason.
Minorco started down its new strategic road in 1988 by making a Dollars
3.5bn hostile bid for Consolidated Gold Fields of the UK. Minorco owned 29.9
per cent of Gold Fields and acceptances took its holding to more than 50 per
cent.
However, a New York judge blocked the takeover, citing Minorco's South
African ownership and Anglo's liking for cartels. Minorco gave up the Gold
Fields battle, leaving the way clear for Hanson.
Minorco collected Dollars 1.6bn cash for its Gold Fields shares. However,
because of the New York ruling, it appeared to have no way of spending it in
the US. But Minorco was eventually given the go-ahead to buy Independence.
Mr Slack admits Independence's financial performance has been disappointing,
but cost-cutting is under way. This includes dismantling the Independence
board and the consequent streamlining of Minorco's cumbersome US management
structure.
There has also been a wider management shake-up at Minorco, which
effectively had three managing directors: the original 'Young Turks' who
persuaded Anglo that Minorco should change its style and mount the offensive
against Gold Fields. Now Mr Tony Lea is being recalled to Anglo's
headquarters in Johannesburg and Mr Roger Phillimore resigned because he
lost the contest for the chief executive's job.
The changes, however, have not diminished Minorco's appetite for
acquisitions. In the past seven months it has spent about Dollars 337m on
four deals: jointly with Anglo it paid Dollars 190m for one third of the
Collahuasi copper project in Chile; it paid Dollars 66m for a half-share in
the Lisheen zinc deposit in Ireland; it paid Pounds 55m (Dollars 84.7m) to
buy Steetley Iberia from Redland, and Dollars 90.6m to swap an indirect
interest in Johnson Matthey, the UK platinum marketing group, for a 10 per
cent direct stake.
Minorco's (and Anglo's) main interest was always Johnson Matthey. Now that
Minorco has a direct shareholding in JM, it has no reason to retain its
stake in Charter Consolidated.
Minorco will also eventually sell Terra, a non-core US unit producing and
distributing agricultural products.
Minorco now has direct interests in two of the world's three big platinum
marketing companies. Apart from 10 per cent of Johnson Matthey it owns 30
per cent of Engelhard in the US.

FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Horrigan joins Liggett Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR EDWARD Horrigan, who headed the large tobacco business at RJR Nabisco and
was vice-chairman of the parent company ahead of the Dollars 25bn leveraged
buy-out of the company in 1989, is re-entering the cigarette business.
The Liggett Group, now the smallest of the leading US cigarette
manufacturers, whose brands include Chesterfield, Lark and Eve, announced
yesterday that Mr Horrigan had been appointed chairman and chief executive,
with effect from May 24.
Mr Horrigan - whose board positions include a directorship at USAir - quit
RJR shortly after the Kolhberg, Kravis Roberts-led leveraged bid won control
of RJR Nabisco.
According to Barbarians at the Gate, the best-selling book on the bid
tussle, Mr Horrigan demanded to either be chief executive of the company, or
part company. He reportedly left with a Dollars 45.7m golden handshake, and
acquired a candy business in Atlanta.
Liggett, part of Brooke Group, has faced troubled times recently, with
declining profits and falling market share. It announced the departure of
its chief executive and chief financial officer in January.
At that stage, the company created an interim three-person 'office of the
chief executive'. The team included Mr Bennett LeBow, chairman of Brooke.
Most recently, Liggett has stirred the already troubled waters of the US
cigarette market by introducing a new discount brand, Eagle, which is
stylishly-packaged and undercuts rival products on price.
The introduction of Eagle came after Philip Morris, the largest US cigarette
company, announced large price cuts in its full-priced brands, and both
Philip Morris and RJR attempted to edge up prices of their discount brands,
narrowing the price differential between the two segments of the market.

MOLSON, the Canadian brewing and retailing group, recorded net profit of
CDollars 113.7m (USDollars 89.3m), or CDollars 1.90 a share, in the year
ended March, against CDollars 126.2m, or CDollars 2.25, in fiscal 1992.
Sales and other revenues rose 6 per cent to CDollars 3.1bn, from CDollars
2.9bn.
Including a special gain of CDollars 51m after tax from the sale of 20 per
cent of its brewing subsidiary to Miller Brewing of the US, total profit for
the year was CDollars 164.7m, or CDollars 2.76 a share.
Molson's share of brewing profits rose 3.8 per cent to CDollars 167.6m.
The recession and a poor summer season were offset by higher prices and more
efficient production.
Molson Breweries is now 40 per cent owned by Molson, 40 per cent by Foster's
of Australia and 20 per cent by Miller.
The link with Miller would raise sales of Molson brands significantly in the
US, said Mr Marshall Cohen, president.
Operating profit from Diversey, Molson's special chemical business, was up
39 per cent, but North American operations were affected by the recession
and problems with absorbing an acquisition.
Sales were flat at CDollars 1.3bn and operating profit fell 9 per cent to
CDollars 70m.
Hardware retailing was restructured and took a special CDollars 83m charge.
The new Aikenhead warehouse store subsidiary reported a CDollars 9.9m
operating loss, but should be profitable this year.
Sports and entertainment had a CDollars 2.9m operating profit, against
CDollars 8.3m.

General Motors said yesterday it had reached agreements with more than 100
banks on about Dollars 21bn of syndicated credit lines that together make up
about half of the group's total worldwide bank credit facilities, writes

additional credit lines with banks in Europe, Canada and Australia.
The newly-negotiated syndications, which replace various individual bank
facilities extended to GM and GMAC, the group's financial services
subsidiary, represented a 'significant increase in the amount of committed,

MR Bob Crandall, chairman of American Airlines, said yesterday the US
carrier had held talks over possible partnerships with a number of European
carriers, including Lufthansa, British Midland, Air France, SAS, and KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines.
Speaking after his company's annual meeting in Texas, Mr Crandall said: 'We
haven't been able to structure a deal that makes sense for us and a European
partner.' However, talks were continuing.
Although talks in the past had covered equity investments, discussions under
way now were more about marketing relationships, he said.
Mr Crandall's comments come in the wake of a number of tie-ups between US
and European carriers - including British Airways' purchase of a minority
interest in USAir, KLM's integration with Northwest Airlines, and the
partnership between Air Canada and Continental.

FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Chemical wins debt trade
approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHEMICAL Banking has received permission from the Federal Reserve to
underwrite and sell corporate bonds through its securities arm.
It is the fifth leading US commercial bank to be granted debt underwriting
powers, after JP Morgan, Citicorp, Bankers Trust and Chase Manhattan.
Several big foreign banks have also been allowed into the business,
including Union Bank of Switzerland and Industrial Bank of Japan.
Traditionally, the commercial banking and securities businesses have been
kept apart in the US. In recent years, however, the Fed has exploited
loopholes in the Glass Steagal Act, the depression-era legislation that
enshrined the separateness of banking and securities business, to allow a
few well-capitalised banks to operate in the corporate debt markets.
However, the banks are not allowed to derive more than 10 per cent of gross
revenues from underwriting and dealing in certain corporate debt securities
for two years.
Chemical hopes to build a presence in the corporate debt market to go
alongside its dominant presence in the bank loan market. It has already
arranged Dollars 33bn of loans this year, making it by far the biggest
lender among US banks.
Initially, the bank, through its Chemical Securities subsidiary, will
concentrate on selling high-yield debt, where the underwriting fees are
higher than on investment-grade debt. Because of its dominant share of the
bank loan market, Chemical believes it has a large client base among likely
issuers of junk bonds.
The Fed's decision was not unexpected. After last year's merger with
Manufacturers Hanover, Chemical became the third-largest US bank, with
consolidated assets of Dollars 147.5bn, and has one of the strongest capital
bases in the industry.
Although Chemical had begun to hire staff with experience in the debt
markets in anticipation of Fed approval, the bank is expected to hire some
traders and bankers who specialise in junk bonds. The main task facing the
bank is to assemble a sales force to distribute the corporate bonds it
underwrites to institutional investors.

FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Mitel posts best profit for
quarter in 11 years
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MITEL, the Canadian tele-phone equipment maker, has posted its best
quarterly profit in 11 years. The result raises a question mark over the
timing of British Telecom's sale last June of its controlling stake in the
Ottawa-based company.
Mitel's improved performance is also reflected in a surging share price. Its
stock was trading at CDollars 3.40 on the Toronto exchange before the close
yesterday, more than double the maximum of CDollars 1.64 per share which BT
realised from the sale of its 51 per cent stake.
Net earnings for the fiscal year to March 26 were CDollars 2.6m (USDollars
2.06m), equal to a loss of 1 cent per common share, compared with a loss of
CDollars 5.7m, or 12 cents, the previous year. Sales rose by 4 per cent to
CDollars 423.4m.
Fourth-quarter earnings, however, were CDollars 11.9m. The improvement was
partly due to favourable exchange rate movements and a CDollars 3.5m
research grant from the Canadian government.
Mr John Millard, president, cautioned that the fourth-quarter performance
was unlikely to be repeated in the first half of this year.
However, the company said that US sales of office switchboards had picked
up, and that its semi-conductor revenues had also risen sharply.
A recent CDollars 52m share issue has strengthened its balance sheet,
leaving it with long-term debt of only CDollars 26m.
BT suffered a loss of at least CDollars 256m on its seven-year investment in
Mitel.

FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Golden opportunities go begging
 -Minorco's plans for expansion are thwarted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Hank Slack does not try to hide his disappointment. As chief executive of
Minorco, he was ready to spend about Dollars 1bn cash on two acquisitions
aimed at turning his businesses into one of the world's biggest mining
groups.
But both tantalising prospects slipped from Minorco's grasp.
Mr Slack's goal was to transform Minorco, until 1988 a sleepy offshore
investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation-De Beers group of South
Africa, by reorganising its portfolio, shaking-up or turfing out existing
operations and buying new ones.
Many analysts suggest, however, that until recently the process has been
painfully slow and not particularly impressive. Minorco's market rating said
it all: its share price has languished at a 30 to 40 per cent discount to
asset values.
The two big opportunities would certainly have changed market perceptions.
Minorco was offered the chance to join the world-class copper producers when
British Petroleum agreed to sell it 49 per cent of the Olympic Dam mine in
South Australia for Dollars 240m, plus Dollars 190m to repay loans.
But Western Mining, the Australian group which had the majority stake in
Olympic Dam, had pre-emptive rights to the BP stake. It kept Minorco in
suspense for four months before deciding to exercise those rights.
All might not be lost, however. Mr Hugh Morgan, managing director of
Western, has invited the Minorco chief to bring a team to look over Olympic
Dam.
Although Mr Slack says he does not know what Mr Morgan has in mind, analysts
jump to the obvious conclusion: that Western might offer Minorco some of the
action at Olympic Dam.
Minorco's other disappointment was never made public. The group hoped to buy
Gold Fields Mining Corporation, which has two gold mines - Chimney Creek in
Nevada and Mesquite in California - from Hanson, the Anglo-American
conglomerate.
GFMC would have been merged with Minorco's Independence Mining subsidiary,
which also operates in Nevada, to become one of North America's top 10 gold
producers.
Hanson opted instead for an asset swap, handing over GFMC to Santa Fe
Pacific in exchange for the US group's coal and aggregate operations. Each
set of assets were estimated to be worth about Dollars 500m.
Mr Slack says Minorco is still looking for more gold opportunities, but that
'the prices being asked are still very fancy'.
Most analysts suggest Minorco paid a 'fancy' price indeed for Independence
Mining, which it bought for Dollars 705m from Freeport McMoRan of the US in
1990. There was, however, an important reason.
Minorco started down its new strategic road in 1988 by making a Dollars
3.5bn hostile bid for Consolidated Gold Fields of the UK. Minorco owned 29.9
per cent of Gold Fields and acceptances took its holding to more than 50 per
cent.
However, a New York judge blocked the takeover, citing Minorco's South
African ownership and Anglo's liking for cartels. Minorco gave up the Gold
Fields battle, leaving the way clear for Hanson.
Minorco collected Dollars 1.6bn cash for its Gold Fields shares. However,
because of the New York ruling, it apparently had no way of spending it in
the US.
This proved not to be the case when Minorco was given the go-ahead to buy
Independence.
Mr Slack admits Independence's financial performance has been disappointing,
but cost-cutting is under way. This includes dismantling the Independence
board and the consequent streamlining of Minorco's cumbersome US management
structure.
There has also been a wider management shake-up at Minorco, which
effectively had three managing directors: the original 'Young Turks' who
persuaded Anglo that Minorco should change its style and mount the offensive
against Gold Fields. Now Mr Tony Lea is being recalled to Anglo's
headquarters in Johannesburg and Mr Roger Phillimore resigned because he
lost the contest for the chief executive's job.
These changes, however, have not diminished Minorco's appetite for
acquisitions. In the past seven months it has spent about Dollars 337m on
four deals: jointly with Anglo it paid Dollars 190m for one-third of the
Collahuasi copper project in Chile; on its own account it paid Dollars 66m
for a half-share in the Lisheen zinc deposit in Ireland; it paid Pounds 55m
(Dollars 84.7m) to buy Steetley Iberia from Redland, and Dollars 90.6m to
swap an indirect interest in Johnson Matthey, the UK platinum marketing
group, for a 10 per cent direct stake.
Steetley, which operates 14 quarries and gravel pits as well as 21
ready-mixed concrete plants in Spain, is being absorbed into Minorco's
industrial minerals division, built up in the past two years entirely by
Dollars 340m-worth of acquisitions.
Minorco bought the Johnson Matthey shareholding from Charter Consolidated,
the UK industrial group over which Minorco - and therefore Anglo - has
considerable influence via a 36 per cent shareholding.
Minorco's (and Anglo's) main interest was always Johnson Matthey. Now that
Minorco has a direct shareholding in JM, it has no reason to retain the
Charter stake.
Some analysts expect Charter to buy its own shares back from Minorco and
thus break free from the Anglo-Minorco influence. Mr Slack says it is up to
Mr Jeff Herbert, Charter's managing director, to make the running.
Minorco will sell Terra, a non-core US subsidiary which produces and
distributes agricultural products, but not while today's depressed market
persists.
Terra, along with the Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting company in Canada, was
part of the inaptly-named Inspiration Resources, and already in Minorco's
pre-1988 portfolio. The Hudbay copper-zinc-nickel business is not
world-class and Minorco is having trouble getting it into shape.
Minorco now has direct interests in two of the world's three big platinum
marketing companies. Apart from 10 per cent of Johnson Matthey it owns 30
per cent of Engelhard in the US. Mr Slack says an important aspect of the
deal with Charter is that Minorco now has more flexibility if at any time it
wanted to increase its interest in either of these groups.
He says Anglo-De Beers still wants to reduce its combined 60 per cent
holding in Minorco to more like 50 per cent in the longer term. But not
while Minorco's shares are at such a substantial discount to its assets.

FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Parker &amp; Parsley sues bid rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARKER &amp; Parsley, the US energy group which last week agreed to pay Dollars
448m for Prudential Securities' troubled energy investment partnerships, is
suing Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas, a rival US energy company which has
submitted a higher bid for the partnerships, for attempting to interfere in
the transaction.
Graham Royalty, which was a general partner in the lossmaking partnerships
with Prudential, is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit.
Parker claims Dreyfus 'maliciously interfered' with the merger agreement
between Parker and Prudential and that Graham Royalty breached the merger
agreement and committed conspiracy and fraud by negotiating with Dreyfus.
On Monday, Prudential agreed to sell its partnerships to Parker for Dollars
448m but a few days later, under pressure from investors in the
partnerships, it was forced to reveal that a counter-offer worth Dollars
510m had already been made by Dreyfus.
At the time, Prudential said it did not accept the higher offer because
there was not enough information in the bid. Prudential has since said it
would consider the bid once Dreyfus had provided a full financing commitment
for its offer, which Dreyfus said it would provide in the next week.
The affair is being watched closely by investors in the Prudential energy
partnerships. After the partnerships racked up big losses in the late 1980s,
the investors sued Prudential for allegedly misleading them over the risks
involved in buying into the partnerships.

profits to Dollars 108.5m in the third quarter to May 2, from Dollars 91.5m
a year earlier.
Sales during the three months rose by 6 per cent, to Dollars 1.63bn, mostly
due to the first-time consolidation of Campbell's ownership interest in
Arnotts, the Australian biscuit company in which the US group has a 58 per
cent stake.
At the earnings per share level, the profits advance translated into a 19
per cent rise, to 43 cents.
On a divisional basis, Campbell said operating profits in its North and
South American divisions rose by 10 per cent, to Dollars 172.6m. In Europe
and Asia, there was a 14 per cent advance, to Dollars 9m.
In the biscuit and bakery division, the inclusion of the Arnotts' results
lifted profits by 47 per cent to Dollars 23.9m - but Campbell said that,
without Arnotts', there would have been a 6 per cent decline due to certain
start-up and new product costs.
Campbell increased its stake in Arnotts to 58 per cent earlier this year
after a bitterly-contested takeover battle, although it still lacks board
control.
The third-quarter figures bring after-tax profits for the first nine months
to Dollars 149.2m, compared with Dollars 381.3m a year earlier, or 59 cents
a share compared with Dollars 1.51.
However, the current-year figures are struck after significant restructuring
charges taken in the second quarter; Campbell said that without these items,
net earnings for the first nine months were up by 18 per cent.
Campbell announced in the second quarter that it was closing two domestic
frozen food plants and selling a number of unspecified businesses. These
moves resulted in the Dollars 300m after-tax charge.

UPJOHN, the US pharma-ceuticals group, has announced a series of
organisational changes which provoked speculation about who would take
charge of the company following the recent death of its chairman and chief
executive, Mr Theodore Cooper.
The company made a number of senior appointments, but did not name a chief
executive or chairman.
Mr Ley Smith, president and chief operating officer, presided over Upjohn's
annual shareholders meeting.
Mr Smith was named acting chief executive in April. He will continue in that
office until the board appoints a successor to Mr Cooper.
Mr Smith said Upjohn would strive to have 1994 earnings at the same level as
in 1993, but did not expect real earnings and sales growth before 1995 when
'the first real revenue impact from our new breakthrough products should
begin to occur.'

FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank opens year firmly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOTAL operating profits at the Deutsche Bank group rose by 'a good 20 per
cent' in the first four months of the year against the comparable period for
1992, the chief executive of Germany's biggest bank told shareholders
yesterday.
Mr Hilmar Kopper said at the bank's annual meeting that it was unrealistic
to expect this level of growth to be maintained throughout the year as a
whole. Last year, total operating profits rose 7 per cent to DM6.39bn
(Dollars 3.96bn).
But he said that the result for the year would be satisfactory, given the
sharp recession in the German economy. He warned that provisions for bad and
doubtful debts would have to be on the same scale as last year, when they
reached DM2.6bn.
Deutsche gave no figures, but the percentage increases are calculated with
reference to a third of the total figure last year, rather than the actual
profits made in the the first four months of last year. Thus total operating
in the first four months of the current year were in the region of DM2.55bn,
up about 16 per cent from the actual figure for the first third of 1992.
Deutsche is the third of Germany's big three banks to report excellent
growth in operating profits in the early months of the current year.
Commerzbank improved profits by more than a quarter in January to March and
Dresdner Bank by 15 per cent in the first four months.
These profit increases provide a slightly unrealistic picture of German
banks' prosperity as they are calculated before provisions which are set to
rise steeply over the course of the current year, reflecting deteriorating
credit risks in recession-struck Germany.
As at other large German banks which have reported strong growth in profits
for the early months of the current year, the bulk of the gain at Deutsche
Bank came from own-account trading activities, stimulated by buoyant
conditions in bund and equity markets earlier in the year.
Growth in net interest income was more subdued.
Own-account trading profits rose by 32 per cent, Mr Kopper said, and
commission income climbed by 13 per cent, while net interest income rose 6
per cent.

inquiry

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANCO SANTANDER, the Spanish banking group, faces renewed investigations
over a tax avoidance scheme it allegedly pioneered, and has been ordered to
put up Pta3.5bn (Dollars 28.6m) as surety against possible fraud charges by
the senior judge of Madrid's monetary court.
The fresh embarrassment for Santander coincides with its launch of Dollars
195m preferential shares issue in the US. This is the fourth such issue in
18 months and completes a programme which will have raised a total of
Dollars 750m for the group.
The ruling by a senior judge of Madrid's monetary court reverses a decision
in January when the court revoked a Pta8bn bond order against the bank in
connection with the same charges. Santander said yesterday it would deposit
the bond but would appeal against the new ruling.
In January, the court accepted Santander's appeal that the bank could not be
investigated over possible irregularities unless prior charges were brought
against persons who had sought to avoid taxes by using the bank's services.

SNAM, the gas distribution subsidiary of Italy's Eni energy and chemicals
holding company, suffered a steep drop in net profits to L139bn (Dollars
90.79m) last year from L636bn in 1991.
As with Agip, the Eni-controlled upstream oil and gas group which reported a
sharp earnings decline last week, Snam's profits were pulled down by impact
of the steep losses at EniChem, Eni's chemicals subsidiary.
EniChem, in which Snam and Agip have substantial stakes through the Sci
holding company, recently reported losses of L1,560bn for 1992, more than
double the amount lost the previous year.
Snam, which is on the Italian government's privatisation list, also blamed
its profits drop on continuing losses in the mining and metalurgy
businesses.
Group turnover fell slightly to L10,807bn from L11,244bn in 1991, with a
slight decline in sales of natural gas to 48.1bn cu metres.
Operating profits rose by 8.9 per cent to L2,200bn

<TEXT>
FORTIS, the Dutch-Belgian financial services group, and Generale de Banque,
Belgium's largest bank, are to fight it out for a stake in the Belgian
state-owned savings bank, ASLK-CGER, in the first round of a four-year,
BFr70bn (Dollars 2.1bn) Belgian privatisation programme.
The sale of up to 49 per cent of ASLK-CGER, which has a network of bank and
insurance branches, could raise as much as BFr33bn and help reduce Belgium's
budget deficit.
Mr Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian finance minister, has also indicated that
a bid for a majority stake in ASLK-CGER would be considered, although
Belgian legislation would have to be altered to allow the state to give up
control.
The deadline for submitting 'indicative non-binding' offers for ASLK-CGER
closed yesterday afternoon. Both Fortis - which groups the activities of the
Belgian insurer AG and the Dutch group Amev - and Generale de Banque
confirmed they had put in bids. They refused to give further details or to
indicate whether they had bid for a majority or minority stake.
Internationale Nederlanden Groep, the Dutch financial services group which
last year considered bidding for Banque Bruxelles Lambert, another leading
Belgian bank, will not be making an offer for ASLK-CGER. ING paid the
required BFr2.5m to examine the ASLK-CGER prospectus but decided the group
would not fit into its strategy.
Until recently Generale de Banque and Fortis were considering linking to
develop 'bancassurance' activities in Belgium, but fell out over the terms
of co-operation. Fortis sold most of its 14.7 per cent stake in the bank a
month ago.
It was not clear yesterday if other bids had been submitted. There had been
rumours that French group Caisse des Depots et Consignations and the German
bank WestLB were interested, but CDC is understood not to have made a bid.
ASLK-CGER, which is being advised by Petercam, the Belgian broker, will now
consider the bids and submit its decision for approval by the government
before the summer. Fortis said it hoped the whole sale could be concluded
before the end of the year.

UNI STOREBRAND, Norway's biggest insurer, yesterday reported a first-quarter
profit, before allocations, of NKr150m (Dollars 21.8m), compared with a
pro-forma loss of NKr151m in the same period last year.
The group, which is producing quarterly results for the first time, says its
expects a good result for 1993 as a whole.
The figures reflect consolidated results of Uni Storebrand, which is under
public administration, and Uni Storebrand New, which was established
following Uni's collapse last August.
Mr Per Terje Vold, chief executive, attributed the improved performance
mainly to substantial gains on securities and lower interest rates.
First-quarter net operating income for Uni Storebrand New was NKr5.88bn. No
comparative pro-forma Uni New figures were given. Uni New posted a profit,
before allocations, of NKr209m.
Uni did, however, give comparative pro-forma 1992 figures for individual
business units.
Life insurance business doubled profit to NKr1.04bn from a pro-forma
NKr512m, despite a fall in market share of 1.9 percentage points to 32.8 per
cent. Premium income fell to NKr1.48bn from a pro-forma NKr1.83bn.
Non-life business posted a profit of NKr87m against a pro-forma loss of
NKr110m. Uni said this year's figure included a charge of NKr121m related to
claims. Premium income rose to NKr1.78bn from NKr1.67bn.
The stronger result is mostly due to a transfer of NKr105.7m in surplus
reserves.
International business lifted profit to NKr31m from a pro-forma NKr21m.
Premium income remained at last year's level of NKr1bn.
Mr Vold said the international unit was undergoing a restructuring in which
the scope of business would focus on reinsurance.

CHINESE steel company Shougang has taken a 74 per cent stake in a fourth
Hong Kong listed company, Kader Investment, for HKDollars 582m (USDollars
75.3m), despite last week's tougher stance on back-door listings by Hong
Kong's regulators.
Following the acquisition, Mr Deng Zhifang, son of Chinese paramount leader
Deng Xiaoping, will join the Hong Kong company's board of directors,
underlining the high profile role China is now taking in its future
sovereign territory. Since the October announcement that Beijing would list
nine mainland-registered companies on the Hong Kong stock market, there has
been an explosion in the number of Chinese companies taking an easier route,
through back-door listings.
In the eight months these nine mainland companies have struggled to resolve
legal and corporate obstacles to their Hong Kong flotations, Chinese
entities have taken stakes of more than 25 per cent in 12 listed companies.
The stock exchange said last week it was clamping down on companies
circumventing listing regulations by purchasing shell companies and
injecting in privately-held assets.
Shougang said that it would neither sell any 'material' assets to Kader, nor
change its focus from property investment.
Only days before the stock exchange decision, Shougang had announced a
HKDollars 1.8bn rights issue by another newly-acquired subsidiary, Tung Wing
Steel.
The Kader stake was purchased from the Ting family and the family's toy
manufacturing company Kader Holdings.

ALMOST a century and a half after it pioneered the hire purchase system in
the US, the Singer sewing machine group is to try the same idea in China's
booming retail market.
Singer Credit, a company jointly owned by Singer and its Hong Kong-listed
parent Semi-Tech (Global), has formed a hire-purchase joint venture company
with China's largest savings bank, the Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China
(ICBC).
The primary focus of Singer Trust &amp; Credit (Shanghai) will be to develop
sales for Singer's growing retail network in China, rather than to become a
profitable business in itself. Singer will have opened 12 retail outlets in
China by the end of this year.
Mr Shen Ruo Lei, president of the Shanghai Branch of ICBC, who attended
yesterday's signing ceremony, said: 'This joint venture company is the first
of this type (in China) and will become the forerunner of the hire purchase
business in China.'
Consumer spending in China has been rising steeply, with retail sales up
25.4 per cent year-on-year in April.

THE AMSTERDAM Stock Exchange and the European Options Exchange (EOE) in
Amsterdam plan to ask a consultancy firm to investigate a merger of their
off-floor support services.
Coopers and Lybrand Management Consultants will report on the findings in
the autumn. The support services to be investigated will include legal
advice, financial administration and accounting.
The exchanges, which are eager to cut costs to remain competitive within
Europe, established a joint executive committee in 1991 to look into closer
links. Reports appeared in the Dutch press recently saying that the bourse
and the options exchange might be planning a full merger. Spokesmen for both
sides, however, have played downed the suggestion, saying it was premature.
Both exchanges are preparing for changes prompted by the dual necessity of
reducing costs and bolstering competitiveness with rival exchanges in
Europe.
The EOE plans to alter its trading system to combine traditional open-outcry
floor trading with a new computer screen option. The stock exchange plans to
split the wholesale and retail segments of the market.
The stock exchange in particular is concerned about the loss of business to
London.

CHAMBERLIN &amp; Hill slowed down in the second half with only a marginal
improvement in pre-tax profits.
Accordingly, the increase over the year ended March 31 1993 was restricted
to 11 per cent, with profits of Pounds 1.59m compared with Pounds 1.43m.
Turnover for the group, which makes iron castings, electrical conduit
fittings and switchgear, improved from Pounds 19m to Pounds 20.3m. That
advance was wholly attributable to exports, the directors said, the
prospects for which were good.
There was yet to be seen clear cut evidence of significant growth in UK
demand, they added.
Earnings per share came to 16.07p (15.28p). The proposed final distribution
amounts to 4.5p (4.25p), which lifts the total payable for the year to
6.25p, against a previous 6p.

FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Frank G Gates better than expected
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Frank G Gates, motor traders, vehicle distributors and contract hire
concern, reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 886,000 for 1992, against
Pounds 1.32m, a fall of 32.6 per cent.
Turnover for the year was virtually unchanged at Pounds 56.7m against Pounds
56.4m.
Mr Edward Gates, chairman, said that the second half of the year turned out
to be better than he had anticipated at the interim stage. He added that the
first quarter of the current period had shown a considerable improvement
over 1992.
Mr Gates said it was sufficient to justify a maintained dividend of 2.25p.
Earnings for the past year fell from 4.85p to 3.65p.

FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Spanish closure holds back Baris
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Baris Holdings, which installs passive fire protection and drying systems,
reduced its pre-tax loss from Pounds 948,000 to Pounds 351,000 in the year
ended February 28 1993.
UK operations continued to perform well, but the year was affected by the
closure of the unprofitable Spanish operation in the second half. Total
losses incurred there, including closure costs, were Pounds 721,000, less a
net tax credit of Pounds 363,000.
There were earnings per share of 0.2p (losses 13.3p) but no dividend is
being paid (2p interim last time).
Mr Robert Smith, chairman, said price competition remained fierce and led to
a reduction in margins on continuing activities from 17.4 per cent to 18.3
per cent.
He did not envisage a reversal of that trend over the next year and, with
the reduced amount of work available, it was likely to effect the gross
profit in the current year.
Current order book was Pounds 9m, against Pounds 14m last year, while
inquiry levels were down from Pounds 64m to Pounds 48m.
A German subsidiary has been formed to exploit a market where margins were
currently higher than in the UK and which should provide a stable work load
over the medium term. A substantial contract had recently been won.

FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Golden Vale stake in Danish company
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Golden Vale, the Irish dairy group, has agreed to acquire 33 per cent of
Danish company A/S Vejle Margarinefabrik, margarine manufacturer, for DKr25m
(Pounds 2.6m), payable in cash on completion.
Golden Vale has an option to acquire a further 33 per cent by December 31
1993 for a similar amount.
In the year to September 30 1992 the Danish company made pre-tax profits of
DKr5.8m on sales of DKr102.2m. Net asset amounted to DKr23.1m.
In April the Irish dairy group reported a 13.5 per cent increase to IPounds
16.7m in 1992 pre-tax profits.
Net borrowings fell to IPounds 7.5m (IPounds 20.6m), and gearing to 8.8 per
cent (27.9 per cent). The company said this allowed it to spend 'another
IPounds 30m to IPounds 40m on acquisitions without having to go to the
market.'
Shortly after it completed the acquisition of Leckpatrick Holdings, a
private dairy processor based in Northern Ireland.
The consideration consisted of 10-year loan notes, redeemable after one
year, valuing each Leckpatrick share at 332p. There was a partial cash
alternative up to a total of IPounds 4.34m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At the end of the half year to April 30, net asset value of Dunedin
Worldwide Investment Trust stood at 702.5p, a 16.4 per cent increase over
the 603.3p at the end of the preceding six months.
The increase beat the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index rise
of 14.9 per cent in sterling. At the end of April 1992 Dunedin's asset value
was 569.7p.
In January funds were switched out of overseas markets and into the UK, as
the managers felt the latter had yet to discount the full extent of the
eventual recovery in company profits.
Total revenue in the half year came to Pounds 4.33m (Pounds 3.16m) and net
revenue to Pounds 1.65m (Pounds 955,000), for earnings per share of 4.84p
(2.78p). The interim dividend is held at 2.4p.
The 1992 net revenue has been reduced by Pounds 279,000 in reflection of the
change in accounting policy on the recognition of income receivable in
respect of fixed interest securities

FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: 50% profit decline at Baggeridge Brick
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Baggeridge Brick suffered from reducing production in the winter, turning in
a pre-tax profit some 50 per cent lower in the six months ended March 31
1993.
Mr Peter Ward, chairman, explained that production was cut in order to help
contain the national over-capacity that was evident at the time. In the
event there was 'some satisfaction' with the results.
In the period turnover rose from Pounds 11.9m to Pounds 13.1m. Operating
profit came to Pounds 905,000 (Pounds 1.41m) with building materials
accounting for Pounds 438,000 (Pounds 864,000) and landsource Pounds 467,000
(Pounds 546,000). Pre-tax profit worked through at Pounds 383,000 (Pounds
761,000).
Sales prices continued under pressure but the group's sales volumes and
market share increased. Stocks were reduced considerably at March 31.
Mr Ward said demand was stronger for social and private housing, and brick
and paving schemes were also on the increase. However, it would be some time
before the commercial and industrial sectors of construction showed much
improvement.
Earnings per share fell to 0.65p (1.29p) but the interim dividend is
unchanged at 0.75p.

FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Tharsis applies for listing cancellation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tharsis, the Glasgow-based group mainly involved in property development in
Spain, has applied to the Stock Exchange for a cancellation of its listing
and permission to deal in its shares under Rule 535.2.
The rules of the Exchange require that at least 25 per cent of a company's
shares must remain in the hands of the public.
Tharsis said that Inpec had recently acquired a further 462,190 shares in
the company, bringing its holding to 1.26m or 48.36 per cent. Following that
purchase, some 83.7 per cent of the company's shares are held by five
shareholders.
It said that the recent low number of transactions in its shares was a
further indication that the company's listing was no longer appropriate or
cost effective.
Dealings under Rule 535.2 are expected to begin on May 24. Allied Provincial
Securities are the company's broker.

FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Engineers still wait to uncork champagne -
The sector faces a slow recovery, according to the survey of the FT Six
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recession may officially be over, but the champagne is being kept on ice
in Britain's battered engineering sector, which faces a slow, spasmodic
recovery to 'normal' levels of business.
The six engineering companies whose progress out of the recession is being
tracked in the FT's occasional survey of the sector say conditions are
improving - but not by much - and confidence within the customer base is
picking up gradually.
The good news is that further job cuts are mostly off the agenda, as long as
the gradual upturn does not grind to a halt.
At JCB, the construction equipment group, employees are even working a
modest amount of overtime.
But, significantly perhaps, those ubiquitous phrases of the past few months
 -'We've definitely bottomed out' and 'It's not getting worse' - have not
yet been laid to rest.
The previous survey in the series, published on December 30, found faint
signs of confidence returning to the customers of the FT Six. Since then,
interest rates have been cut by another 1 percentage point.
But the first four months of this year have shown that the engineers were
right to be cautious in December about the pace of the recovery -
recognising that it would take time for customers to feel confident about
the stability of the interest rate and currency environment.
This is how things are looking for the FT Six:
Fenner, the power transmission and industrial conveyor belting group,
announced its half-year results on Tuesday.
Pre-tax profits dropped from Pounds 2.28m to Pounds 105,000, but Mr Peter
Barker, chairman, said customer confidence was rising.
With UK manufacturing output set to rise this year and next, the company was
'well placed to derive maximum advantage from the recovery that now appears
to be underway.'
At Senior Engineering Group, the tubing, boilers and ductwork company,
volumes have improved in some consumer-related businesses, although not in
more investment-related sectors where the lead times are longer.
Mr John Bell, chief executive, says there is more confidence within
industry, and speaks of 'a will to see things improve.'
Overall, he had seen a gentle improvement in UK business conditions, but a
normal level of activity was probably some months away, perhaps in the
autumn.
One hopeful sign comes in Senior's contract heat treatment business, which
takes in metal components from a wide range of manufacturers and heats them
for extra strength.
Here, there has been a good improvement in volumes, says Mr Bell: 'This is a
true indicator of the economy. It takes in business on a day-to-day basis,
and there is nothing more instant than that.'
Mr Peter Burton, chief executive of Bloxwich Engineering, says: 'I feel in
my bones that perhaps the recession is over,' but he warns that there will
be no sudden revival of activity for the Walsall-based car and truck parts
company.
The car side of Bloxwich's parts business has picked up, he says, due partly
to continuing and forthcoming business from the Japanese transplants. But
the truck parts business has yet to revive, and has not been helped by the
receivership of Leyland-DAF, an important customer.
Another 'chink' which Mr Burton points to is Bloxwich's tool-making
business, where press tool activity has increased. 'To make cars, you need
tools first,' says Mr Burton, 'and customers are now optimistic enough to
release work.'
Overseas markets, and particularly Germany, offer mixed prospects.
On the one hand, Mr Burton says, 'We think the German economy is in a hell
of a mess.' But he hopes Bloxwich can benefit from the more international
sourcing policy at Volkswagen under the new purchasing director, Mr Jose
Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua.
The 600 Group, the producer and distributor of machine tools and materials
handling equipment, has also been hit, at least in the short term, by the
Leyland-DAF collapse.
The engineering company has 50 per cent of the market for truck-mounted
cranes, and one-third of its products in this sector went on Leyland-DAF
Trucks, says Mr Colin Gaskell, managing director.
Overall, Mr Gaskell is unable to report any 'vast upturn' in the UK market,
but there are a lot more inquiries around, he says. 'Our sales guys are much
more optimistic than they have been.' The rate of purchase by end-users of
machine tools, as opposed to dealers, has picked up.
As at Bloxwich, Mr Gaskell is concerned about economic conditions on the
Continent, which look 'pretty sick.'
But he thinks that the devaluation of sterling has created an opportunity to
sell machine tools in Germany, where customers might refuse to pay the
customary premium for domestically-produced equipment if it becomes
excessive.
At JCB, the period from April-June is a traditional stage of increased
buying by plant-hirers and other users of earthmoving equipment, so gauging
any upturn is difficult. But Mr Gilbert Johnston, deputy chairman, feels
that the UK market 'just has to be past the worst.
'Things are better, but it's not something we're jumping up and down about,'
he says. In broad terms, activity could still rise by between 25 and 30 per
cent to reach normal levels for the domestic market.
Mr Johnston says the improvement will be gradual. Indeed he hopes this is
the case, as that would produce a more stable and sustainable recovery.
Mr Johnston is not expecting any immediate help from the all-important UK
construction market, where activity was described recently as still at
dangerously low levels. Taking a five-year view, however, he says it looks
good for improvement.
Finally, Mr Reg Bricknell, managing director of Posiva, the gears and drives
producer, does not think that the recession is over, but there are pockets
of industry producing more orders.
Although German-owned Posiva has had to adjust to the effect of the sterling
devaluation on the products it brings in from Germany, it is also benefiting
from increased activity among customers exporting from the UK.
The order intake in the first three months of the year was 36 per cent
higher than the comparable period of 1992. 'This is not just green shoots,'
Mr Bricknell says. 'It's due to the efforts from our salesmen.'
The increase in business has been helped by equipment that Posiva is
supplying to the big UK builders of power stations and water treatment
plants in Asia.
In the home market, though, Mr Bricknell does not yet see sufficient
stability to prompt confidence that activity will continue upwards. He would
like to see a few more months of the same growth trend before declaring the
recession over.

10m
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST-quarter earnings of Maple Leaf Foods, the Canadian food processor
which is 56 per cent owned by Hillsdown Holdings, dipped by almost 5 per
cent as a result of weak demand and fierce competition.
Net earnings were CDollars 10.2m (Pounds 5.2m) or 13 cents a share, down
from CDollars 12m, or 15 cents a share, a year earlier.
Last year's figures exclude a CDollars 3.3m contribution from the
discontinued edible oils business.
Sales dropped slightly, from CDollars 638m to CDollars 632m, but operating
profits tumbled by 24 per cent to CDollars 13.2m. The directors explained
that results were cushioned by higher interest income and lower tax
provisions.
Large tax payments made during the quarter have reduced cash reserves to
CDollars 172m compared with CDollars 205m at the end of 1992. Long-term debt
has grown from CDollars 12.5m to CDollars 43.6m in the past year.
The company said that many sectors of the retail food business had been hit
by lower demand, competitive pricing and 'trading-down' by consumers to
lower margin products.
On the other hand, agribusiness earnings improved sharply, partly because of
a rationalisation of facilities. Mr Charles Bowen, chief executive, forecast
an improvement in earnings over the rest of the year thanks to lower costs
and new products.

DIVIDEND increases of over 10 per cent in real terms are expected to loom

This has provided some fizz to the shares in the last few days.
Scottish Power will be the first of the 17 companies to unveil its
performance for the year ended March 31. The remainder will be strung out
over the next seven weeks, making the power industry something of a results
marathon for investors and stock analysts.
The focus on dividends is a touchy issue for the regional electricity
companies (RECs) and the generators because of the fuss that earlier
generous pay-outs have caused. There is also the reaction of Professor
Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator to be considered. He has
embarked on a wide-ranging review of electricity pricing practices.
Previous results seasons have shown that the later a company reports the
larger its dividend increase tends to be, as if boldness grows with time.
The RECs deny that this is the case.
But it is a fact that the three regional companies tipped to make the
biggest increases, Yorkshire, Seeboard and Southern, do not report until
late June and early July.
Among the generating companies, National Power will also be a high payer.
PowerGen has already paid its second dividend, showing an overall increase
of 14 per cent.
The electricity companies will justify their high dividends by pointing to
their financial strength and the high level of dividend cover. Analysts at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd are estimating average cover for the RECs of 2.8
times, with Manweb as high as 3.5.
The background to the results is fairly straightforward. Despite the
incipient recovery, overall electricity sales are unlikely to show much
change. But this does not mean that the RECs will return a uniform
performance.
Actual profit growth will be mixed, with increases in single as well as
double figures expected. The variations will reflect RECs' success, or lack
of it, in the highly competitive non-franchise market, and other variables
like bad debts and cost control. They will also report the fortunes of
sideline activities such as appliance retailing, which have caused trouble
in the past.
The big event that occurred in the second half of the industry's financial
year was the settlement of the coal crisis. The uncertainty over the volumes
and price of electricity to be generated from the new long-term coal
contracts between the generators and British Coal has been removed.
This creates a framework for a significant part of the industry's long-term
business. However, there is still the question of how much additional coal
the generators will take from British Coal under the government's recently
agreed programme to subsidise more pits. It seems unlikely, though, that
either National Power or PowerGen will be willing to make firm commitments
quite yet, though the comments of all the electricity companies will be
keenly picked over by British Coal.
Prof Littlechild is currently engaged on a review of the pricing formula in
the electricity supply industry, and he is expected to announce the results
in July.
But analysts say he is unlikely to tighten the formula because he seems to
want to encourage more entrants into this market.
More crucial will be the review of the distribution business which he will
then embark upon.
This accounts for the bulk of the RECs' revenues, and any tightening of the
regulatory regime would be reflected in REC profits and, therefore, in the
dividends which provide the strongest underpinning to the sector.

FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Willis Corroon expands by 12%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST-quarter results from Willis Corroon, the largest insurance broker in
the UK, improved nearly 12 per cent but the directors are sticking to their
dividend cut.
They had forecast a reduction of up to 50 per cent in the year's total in
March when they halved the first interim to 1.65p. Now they are taking the
same action with the second interim.
In the 1992 year group profits were pulled back by substantial provisions in
its UK insurance subsidiary. In the opening quarter of 1993 further
provisions were included in losses of Pounds 2.9m incurred by the
discontinued operations.
Using a constant exchange rate of Dollars 1.50 to the pound in the quarter,
pre-tax profit came to Pounds 47.1m (Pounds 42.1m). The operating profit of
Pounds 47.2m (Pounds 39.9m) comprised broking Pounds 42.6m (Pounds 36.5m)
and underwriting Pounds 4.6m (Pounds 3.4m).
Geographically, that was split as to UK Pounds 34.9m (Pounds 36.8m), the US
Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 3.1m) and rest of the world Pounds 1.9m (nil).
Earnings per share were 7.1p (6.7p).
Profitability of the broking and consulting businesses improved as a result
of actions taken over the last two years. On an underlying basis brokerage
and fee revenue grew by 2 per cent while operating expenses fell by 2 per
cent.
Insurance companies in North America made another solid contribution.
Results of the discontinued UK underwriting operations were again
disappointing, caused by deterioration in the final three underwriting years
and further provisions.

FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Market disappointed with CU first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL Union, the most successful UK composite insurer in recent years,
yesterday disappointed the markets with poorer first quarter figures than
had been expected.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 16.2m for the first three months of 1993 compared
with a loss of Pounds 19.2m, providing further evidence of the recovery in
the UK general insurance market. However, the market was disappointed at the
scale of the improvement, clipping the shares 6p to 594p.
'It is a good result but the improvement is not as marked as the rest of the
sector,' commented Mr Stephen Bird, analyst with Smith New Court, the
securities house. Mr Bird pointed to a deterioration in the group's London
market operations - where underwriting losses rose from Pounds 18.9m to
Pounds 23.5m - - as a cause for concern.
CU stressed the improvement in the UK where, like its rivals General
Accident and Royal Insurance, it had been helped by increased premium rates
and lower expenses. UK underwriting losses fell from Pounds 54.1m to Pounds
34.7m.
With its solvency strengthened by the Pounds 428m rights issue in February,
CU has also continued to increase premium income, especially in UK motor,
home and life markets, although the pace of growth declined compared with
the fourth quarter of last year.
Overall life premium income rose to Pounds 518.5m (Pounds 454.4m) and
general insurance premiums to Pounds 1.09bn (Pounds 830.3m). Investment
income of Pounds 84.1m (Pounds 64.3m) was offset by an underwriting loss of
Pounds 99.8m (Pounds 113.6m).
Earnings from associated undertakings amounted to Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 3.1m).
A non-life operating loss of Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 46.2m) was offset by life
profits of Pounds 29.8m (Pounds 27m).
Mr Tony Brend, chief executive, said that losses from the Bishopsgate bomb
last month would feed through into the group's figures in the second
quarter.
'Information on possible losses is still incomplete but current indications
are that the effect, after reinsurance, is unlikely to exceed Pounds 25m,'
said Mr Brend.

FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Focus on the luxury look - Time Products'
US expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A US manufacturer of luxury handbags might seem an unlikely diversification
for a UK watch and jewellery distribution group, but Time Products is
convinced that the recent acquisition offers immense opportunities.
The UK company paid Dollars 17m (Pounds 11m) in March for the business of
Judith Leiber, an American who designs handbags which can sell for several
thousand dollars each.
Mr Marcus Margulies, chairman of Time Products, said of the acquired
company: 'Its products have not been actively marketed outside North America
and I am confident that there is a substantial potential for developing the
brand on a worldwide basis.
Mr Margulies is excited about the opportunities for the group - particularly
in North America, where leading department stores are keen to stock Judith
Leiber's handbags. 'The day just hasn't got enough hours in it at the
moment.'
Time Products owns Sekonda watches, one of the UK's biggest mass-market
brands, but it is increasingly focusing on luxury goods.
Mr Margulies said that three years ago the balance of the group would have
been 80 per cent mass-market and 20 per cent luxury products, and by next
year the proportion would be reversed.
In March the company paid Pounds 2m for 5 per cent of Audemars Piguet, the
Swiss watchmaker which specialises in technical and luxurious pieces.
These most recent investments came together when Time Products was awarded
the North American agency for Audemars - having distributed its watches in
the UK for a number of years. A showroom for the luxury watches is now being
developed at Judith Leiber's New York premises.
Time Products also claims to be the UK's leading distributor of branded
simulated pearls following the bolt-on acquisition of Rosita and Samuel
Jones. In spite of recent heavy spending on acquisitions, the group has
about Pounds 10m of net cash.
Time Products reported a 22 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
9.3m for the year to January 31, on overall sales down from Pounds 51.1m to
Pounds 49.6m.
The group's shares have risen from 101p at the end of 1990 to their present
level of 208p, giving it a market value of Pounds 110m.
Mr Margulies gives much of the credit for Time Product's new strategic
stance to Mr Richard Langdon, the City company doctor who took over from him
as chairman from 1984, after difficulties in Hong Kong had pushed the group
into the red.
Although Time Products makes watchstraps and now handbags, manufacturing
will never again play a big role in group thinking.
Mr Langdon, who retires from the board soon, handed the chairmanship back
last year to Mr Margulies, whose family controls 20 per cent of the company.
Mr Margulies said: 'Richard forced us to put blinkers on - we now know we
have to concentrate on brands and marketing.'

FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: British Gas in joint venture with Tenneco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS has agreed with Tenneco Gas, the gas arm of the US industrial
company, to develop joint gas transport projects in South America, writes
Deborah Hargreaves.
The agreement follows the company's move last week to set up a new
subsidiary, British Gas Sudamerica, to provide services to the gas, water,
telecommunications and electricity companies in South America.
Mr Mike Fulwood, British Gas general manager for the US and Latin America,
said the companies were looking at a number of opportunities.
Last December a consortium headed by British Gas won a controlling share in
MetroGas, the distribution company in Argentina. The company is hoping to
use its experience in MetroGas as a base for moving into other gas projects.
British Gas said it would drill its first well in the Black Sea in July
after it won licences to explore for oil and gas in Bulgaria.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Net asset value of the German Investment Trust rose by 7.7 per cent, from
87.5p to 94.2p, over the year ended March 31 1993.
The managers said that costs of unification had overridden the longer term
potential for growth, and had tarnished the performance of the equity market
in Germany.
However, interest rates there were falling allowing others in Europe to
follow suit.
Revenue in the year totalled Pounds 757,000 (Pounds 792,000) and the net
outcome was Pounds 165,000 (Pounds 235,000) because of a fall in other
income and an increase in the effective tax rate.
Earnings per share were down to 0.42p (0.6p) and the dividend follows that
trend at 0.4p (0.6p).

FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Enskilda Ventures sells fund
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ENSKILDA Ventures, the London-based venture capital arm of the Skandinaviska
Enskilda Banken Group, has sold its Scandinavian management buy-out fund,
Scandinavian Acquisition Capital, to the fund's management.
SAC, a SKr764m (Pounds 67.5m) fund, has been acquired by a new company
called Industri Kapital, majority owned by Mr Bjorn Saven, former director
of SAC.
SAC, which has invested 70 per cent of its money, will be better placed to
raise new funds if it is an independent company, Enskilda said.
SAC's funds have all been provided by Scandinavian investors and all but one
of its eight investments have been in Scandinavian companies, but it will
retain its headquarters in London.
SE-Banken said its fund management operation would remain an investor in
SAC.
Enskilda will retain control of European Acquisition Capital (EAC), an
Ecu83m (Pounds 65.3m) fund raised last year to back buy-outs in the UK and
continental Europe outside Scandinavia. EAC's first investment, of Pounds
6.5m, was in Tom Cobleigh, a Mansfield-based pub chain.

FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Leeds reaps Pounds 2.9m and buys into
Continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEEDS Group, the West Yorkshire-based textile dyer and printer described by
Mr Robert Wade, its chairman as 'tortoise, not a hare', lifted pre-tax
profit 16 per cent from Pounds 2.51m to Pounds 2.92m in the six months to
March 31. This steady progress was 'no more or less than is expected of us.'
Turnover grew 4.5 per cent to Pounds 21.7m (Pounds 20.8m). However Mr Wade
pointed out that, although this gave the impression of a climb in margins,
they had in fact remained either constant or had slipped a little, though
volume production had risen more than the turnover advance indicated.
He said that the financial value of sales had been adversely affected by two
factors.
First, the fire at the Walsden factory, which accounts for a little less
than 20 per cent of the group's output, had hit production - a
'conservative' Pounds 385,000 exceptional credit was taken above the line to
account for any business interruption insurance. Second, there was a 31 per
cent fall in wool prices during the last year, though Mr Wade added that
they had risen in the past few weeks.
Since the period-end, Leeds made its first non-UK acquisition in the
Netherlands. For an initial Pounds 2.49m and a maximum further payment of
Pounds 1.03m, it has bought TIM Beheer and Itex Brummen, which specialise in
transfer printing of textiles and merchanting dyed and printed fabrics, as a
'springboard' for the rest of Europe.
The non-apparel business continued to grow, though it still represented less
than 25 per cent of the group.
Mr Wade said Leeds liked to do 'difficult things where the margins are high'
 -the camouflage, printed furniture fabrics and curtains operations
performed well, he said.
The difference between Leeds and other textiles groups, he said, was that it
did not spin, weave or make clothing; it was simply concerned with colour
and design, converting a commodity to what the market wanted very quickly.
On the non-textile side, Mr Wade said that Leeds Leasing had started to
write an increased level of business after two years of restricted activity.
Earnings per share rose to 10.8p (9.5p) and the interim dividend is lifted
to 2.75p (2.33p).

FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Allied Lyons' Pounds 200m bond issue
launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED-LYONS, the drinks, food and retailing group, yesterday launched its
Pounds 200m convertible bonds issue.
News of this was leaked last weekend and led to three days of see-sawing
share prices.
The company said yesterday that its financial advisers were discussing the
leakage with the stock exchange and decisions about possible action would be
made after the talks.
'We are very concerned about the leakage, which certainly was not in our
interests,' Allied said.
The timing of the convertible issue, which came a day after the group
reported a Pounds 10m increase in full year profits to Pounds 620m, had not
been affected by the leakage, it added.
Allied said the proceeds of the issue would be used for 'general corporate
purposes.' Some will replace short - term bank borrowings used to finance
its free - trade pubs' loan book.
None of the cash is intended for acquisitions, such as the purchase for an
estimated Pounds 40m from Seagram of Perrier - Jouet/Barton &amp; Guestier, the
French distribution company.
Allied repeated its long-standing pledge yesterday to launch a rights issue
only to fund a major acquisition.
The 15-year bonds will be converted into Allied ordinary shares at a premium
between 17 per cent and 20 per cent above the company's share price. A
coupon of 6 3/4 per cent will be paid twice a year.
Credit Suisse First Boston is leading the issue and Cazenove and SG Warburg
Securities will be co-lead managers. There will also be a group of
international co-managers.

FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Acatos rises to Pounds 5.14m despite static
sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACATOS &amp; Hutcheson, the manufacturer and supplier of edible vegetable oils,
lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.23m to Pounds 5.14m in the half year to
March 28.
The new FRS 3 accounting standard meant the improvement for the six months
was flattened by an exceptional credit of Pounds 600,000 shown for the
comparable period. Last time it was recorded as an extraordinary item.
Turnover was static in the first half at Pounds 104.9m (Pounds 104.6m) and
trading remained difficult in the current half, said Mr Ian Hutcheson,
chairman.
'Prices in the retail sector remain under pressure while some easing in the
bakery market will not benefit us significantly in the current year.' More
than 50 per cent of turnover goes to catering and retail customers.
He said performance gains at the company's Orchard Place factory, which
contributed to the improved profits, would not be repeated on the same scale
and there would be less scope for further interest savings.
Net interest charges fell to Pounds 387,000 (Pounds 826,000) because of
lower interest rates and the company said gearing was further reduced. Mr
Ian Caunt, finance director, said gearing figures fluctuated with purchases
of raw materials.
Mr Hutcheson said his confidence in future prospects was increasing:
'Volumes were maintained in all our principle markets despite continued
strong competition.'
The company said the continuing decline in the total market for edible oils
concealed a switch away from non-refined oils based on animal fats in favour
of vegetable fats. Mr Caunt said: 'Animal fats are a minor part of our
business and have been for a number of years.
'We have progressively shifted into vegetable oils and in addition produce
some more sophisticated products like low-fat spreads.'
The board has declared an interim dividend of 3p (2.5p) on earnings per
share of 10.4p (9p).

FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Compass route raises eyebrows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR 18 months Compass has said it wanted to move into Europe to establish a
contract catering business in the fragmented market.
It was therefore only the route that raised eyebrows yesterday when Compass
group bought the SAS airport catering and contract catering business for
Pounds 71.9m, financed through a rights issue.
While the market greeted the deal favourably, the choice of Scandinavia,
does require some explaining. As one analyst said, 'It is good deal but it
could have made a better move into Europe.'
First of all, the majority of the contract catering business is in
Scandinavia - about 40 per cent of that is in Norway's offshore sector. And
half the airports are in Norway or Sweden, with 20 per cent in the UK.
It is not entirely clear why these northern reaches provide a better
platform for growing in the Benelux, France and Germany - the key European
markets - than does the UK.
Secondly, Compass is increasing the risk profile of its business. Catering
for workplaces or health services may be cut - throat but having won the
contract the income line is at least nailed down. With airports, tomorrow's
sales cannot be known for certain.
Thirdly it is not clear that the Compass style of squeezing suppliers to
improve margins will necessarily travel to the Continent or that it will be
easy to implement across eight countries.
Compass is confident, however, that it can deliver improved margins. Mr
Roger Matthews, finance director says the SAS businesses will give the group
experience of managing in Europe and the chance to grow organically from a
modest base in Germany, one of its strategic target markets.
By moving into airports, Compass has also gained exposure to a market
segment that will recover earlier in the economic cycle than its existing
businesses. Contract catering in the UK may now be bumping along the bottom
but it could be a relatively late beneficiary of economic recovery while the
push into hospital and educational catering will also take a while to bear
fruit.
Compass has also bought from SAS the option to introduce Burger King
hamburger outlets at European airports outside France. This will give it a
useful comparator for the Casey Jones hamburger and Upper Crust sandwiches,
two much smaller brands it bought last year.
Financially, the deal has done Compass no harm. Deferred payment and a
rights issue slightly larger than the purchase price will reduce gearing
from the 200 per cent that would have prevailed at the end of 1993. Gearing
should now be about 77 per cent on debt of Pounds 39m. More importantly in
this business, Compass's interest cover rises from about seven times to over
14 times.
Following the deal some analysts have lifted forecasts of earnings to 38.9p
for the first full year, which gives a prospective multiple of 13.6, a
modest premium to the market.

FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Young &amp; Co slips 7.5% to Pounds 5.17m as
operating margins decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER interest costs helped depress pre-tax profits at Young &amp; Co's
Brewery, the south London-based real ale brewer, by 7.5 per cent from Pounds
5.59m to Pounds 5.17m for the year to March 27.
Stripping out last time's exceptional profit of Pounds 244,223 on the sale
of assets, the decline was 3 per cent.
Turnover was Pounds 72.9m (Pounds 68.1m). Operating profits rose to Pounds
8.19m (Pounds 8.03m).
Interest charges rose to Pounds 3.02m (Pounds 2.68m) mainly because of
increased borrowings for the August 1991 acquisition of HH Finch, the owner
of 22 pubs and six wine bars, and fluctuations in interest rates.
The company said gearing at the year-end was unchanged at about 30 per cent.
In April, Young raised Pounds 15m from a debenture issue partly to repay
bank loans.
Operating margins slipped to 11.23 per cent (11.79 per cent). Mr John Young,
chairman, said: 'We offer lower prices. In the light of events we probably
should have put them up but we try to offer better prices than our
competitors.
'Recovery is slow and gradual. In the south and south-east, the recession is
still biting quite hard.'
He said the company's four hotels, opened on existing pub sites, were
repaying their investment.
The company is opening another on Monday in south London and has planning
permission for two more. Mr Young said he thought the company would
ultimately run seven or eight hotels.
The board proposes a same-again final dividend of 7.5p giving a maintained
total for the year of 14.5p. Earnings per share fell to 26.4p (27.51p).

FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: RJB goes to market valued at Pounds 103m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RJB MINING, the privately owned coal company which aims to take advantage of
the restructuring of the British coal industry, is being floated on the
stock market with a value of Pounds 103m.
The shares were priced yesterday at 250p.
This represents a multiple of 11 times earnings for 1992, excluding interest
on the finance raised to buy the company out the year before.
The price also reflects a notional gross dividend yield of 5.75 per cent.
Just under half the company's shares, or 20m, are being offered for sale,
and 13.3m of these have been firmly placed.
Of the Pounds 50m proceeds, Pounds 24.3m net will go to the company to repay
bank borrowings and provide additional working capital. Existing
shareholders will receive Pounds 23.5m of cash.
After the sale the principal shareholders will be Schroder Ventures with 28
per cent, Charterhouse with nine per cent and Mr Richard Budge, the chief
executive, with 10 per cent.
Deadline for applications is 10am on May 27. Dealings start on June 7.
The Union of Democratic Miners took the unusual step yesterday of backing
the flotation, with a call for British Coal to speed up negotiations to sell
unwanted pits to companies like RJB.
Mr Neil Greatrex, UDM President, said: 'Budge are convinced that they have
the markets for coal and we support them. But unless a decision is made
soon, this will be yet another lost opportunity for the industry.'
COMMENT
With no obvious point of comparison in the market, the pricing of RJB
presents something of a problem. But the indications are that underwriters
BZW are erring on the side of caution. The Pounds 103m price tag is at the
low end of the Pounds 100m-Pounds 120m range being bandied about. The
earnings multiple is also below the average for the industrial materials
sector, and the yield is slightly higher. This reflects partly the heavy
demands currently being placed on the market, and also the uncertainty in
RJB's prospects. If it fails to capitalise on the changes in the coal
industry it will be left to the mercy of British Coal. But if it succeeds it
could emerge as the country's leading low cost producer. The flotation is an
opportunity to take a bet on the outcome.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Equipment group sells Kango to Atlas Copco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOBSON Park Industries, the UK mining equipment and industrial group, is
withdrawing from the highly competitive power tool industry with the sale of
its loss-making demolition hammer operation, Kango, for Pounds 7.8m.
Atlas Copco, the Swedish tools manufacturer, is to buy the Kango name and
business, while High Speed Production, a private UK company, has agreed to
purchase the division's machining and assembly operations. High Speed will
then manufacture Kango product for Atlas.
Mr Alan Kaye, Dobson's chairman, said Dobson had decided it could not
compete against international giants such as Bosch of Germany. 'The scale of
the people we were trying to compete with makes it difficult to keep up with
the technology,' he said. 'Kango's potential will best be realised as part
of a larger group within the power tools business.'
Kango, which just four years ago returned pre-interest profits of Pounds
2.5m, has suffered from the sharp downturn in the global construction
industry. Last year it incurred losses of Pounds 600,000. Dobson has been
under pressure in other areas of its business and recently agreed to put its
mining equipment division into a joint venture with a main rival to weather
the UK coal crisis.
For Atlas Copco, Europe's largest air compressor manufacturer, Kango
represents another step towards its goal of increasing its presence in
electric tools.
Dobson will receive Pounds 6.5m in cash upon completion, with the remaining
Pounds 1.3m payable within one year.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Compass to acquire catering from SAS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPASS GROUP, the health-care and catering company, is to move into
continental Europe through the acquisition of the airport restaurant and
contract catering business of SAS Service Partner, the subsidiary of the
Swedish airline.
The Pounds 71.9m purchase price is to be funded through a six for 19 rights
issue at 420p, 20 per cent below Tuesday's close. The rights issue will
raise Pounds 86.8m.
The acquisition will give Compass a presence in eight mainly northern
European countries, and 34 airports. It will also provide an entry into the
fragmented continental contract catering business, although most of the SAS
contracts are in Scandinavia or in the off-shore sector where growth
prospects are limited in the short term.
UK analysts have recently been concerned that Compass has been better at
improving margins through tight purchasing than increasing sales.
But the market reacted enthusiastically yesterday. The shares rose 1p to
528p as the City digested the company's statement that the acquisition and
rights issue will be modestly earnings enhancing in its first full year.
Compass also reported an increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 17m to
Pounds 18.2m for the six months to end March on sales up 18.6 per cent at
Pounds 209.4m. Earnings per share rose from 16.8p to 18p and the group is to
pay a 4.44p interim dividend, up 6 per cent.
The board forecast a final dividend of not less than 8.56p which, if paid,
would mean a 5.7 per cent increase over 1992.
Mr Francis Mackay, chief executive, said the catering division had performed
well with operating profits rising 8 per cent to Pounds 14.6m.
The group has also implemented a reorganisation into seven divisions which
it hopes will provide a better structure to pursue contracts.
Profits in the healthcare division grew 6.7 per cent to Pounds 6.7m.
Acquisitions during the period pushed borrowings from Pounds 38m at the
start of the year to Pounds 67.2m, but interest cover was at least seven
times.
Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, brought the SAS deal to Compass and
underwrote the rights issue with Lazards.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Saatchi surprises City with rights issue to raise Pounds 73m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAATCHI and Saatchi, the world's fourth largest advertising group, yesterday
sprang a Pounds 73m rights issue on the City.
Shareholders are asked to pay 130p, a 24 per cent discount to Tuesday's
closing price of 172p, on the basis of 10 new shares for every 27 held.
About Pounds 36.5m of the cash will be used to reduce bank debt (average net
debt was Pounds 194m in December 1992), Pounds 19m will be used to acquire
minority interests in European advertising subsidiaries, Pounds 10.5m will
be used to strengthen media buying businesses and to develop businesses in
growing markets in Asia, Latin America and east Europe, Pounds 7m will be
used to acquire new information technology.
The targeted minority interests are 50 per cent of SSAW Italy; 20 per cent
of Grupo BSB Spain; and 37 per cent of Scholz &amp; Friends Germany.
Mr Charles Scott, chief executive, said yesterday the group's 20-bank
syndicate fully approved the rights issue. He was confident that
institutional investors would support the call for additional cash. For Mr
Scott, the rights issue continues the process of putting the group back on a
sound financial footing.
The rights issue is fully underwritten by SG Warburg and UBS Ltd. The
largest institutional investor is the State of Wisconsin Investment Board
with 8.99 per cent. Currently, 50 per cent of the group's shareholders are
in the US, 40 per cent in the UK. Of that number, half are private
individuals.
Since 1990 the group has sold seven non-core businesses and is now
concentrating, Mr Scott said, on organic growth of its main business, global
advertising. However, there are some doubts about future trading in the US,
where an important clients, Mars, has consolidated its media buying outside
the group.
In March 1991 Saatchi achieved a recapitalisation, which removed the threat
of having to redeem Pounds 211m of Euro-preference shares. Saatchi's share
price has moved from the equivalent of more than Pounds 60 in 1986, to 95p
in December 1991, touching 245p in May 1992. Saatchi's share price yesterday
dropped to 161p but finished the day down just 2p at 170p.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Bass hit by UK recession and more bad debts: Chairman
expects slow recovery - City responds by taking 50p off share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASS, the brewing and hotels group, reported a 14 per cent decline in first
half pre-tax profits as Holiday Inns in continental Europe were affected by
growing recession and the UK brewing business increased provisions for bad
debts.
Profits for the six months to April 10 fell from Pounds 266m to Pounds 228m
 -and the market responded by taking 50p from the shares which closed at
483p.
Mr Ian Prosser, chairman and chief executive, said UK sales trends in the
past few weeks suggested that the economy was finally stirring. 'But we do
not expect any recovery will be fast, and so expect limited benefit from it
in the second half of our trading year.'
Group operating profits slipped from Pounds 285m to Pounds 268m on turnover
2 per cent higher at Pounds 2.3bn.
Brewing profits were 5.2 per cent lower at Pounds 73m, after bad debt
provisions were increased from Pounds 10m to Pounds 19m. Beer volumes were
marginally higher, despite the group's disposal of 872 pubs. Overall market
share rose 0.2 percentage points, with beer supplies to free trade pubs
ahead 7 per cent.
Rationalisation savings helped ease the pressure from competitive
discounting but, after the bad debt provisions, margins declined from 9.3
per cent to 8.7 per cent. 'We are not leading the discounting in the
industry but responding to it where necessary,' Mr Prosser said.
Pub profits, reflecting the reduction in outlets, fell 11 per cent to Pounds
98m on turnover 2 per cent lower at Pounds 568m. Capital spending of Pounds
48m was slightly lower.
Holiday Inn profits dropped from Pounds 54m to Pounds 50m on turnover which
increased 13 per cent to Pounds 289m. Improvement in North America was more
than offset by an Pounds 8m fall in profits from the European operations. In
the half year, 70 hotels joined the Holiday Inn system worldwide, and a
further 200 hotels are due to join in the next 18 months.
Leisure business profits were up 11.8 per cent to Pounds 38m, with good
performances from Coral betting shops and Gala bingo halls.
Profits from Britvic soft drinks declined 28 per cent to Pounds 5m, largely
due to increased costs as a result of sterling's devaluation.
The strengthening of the dollar also added Pounds 150m to the group's net
borrowings which, in total, rose Pounds 400m. Gearing increased from 19 per
cent to 31 per cent; and interest charges moved from Pounds 27m to Pounds
39m. Earnings per share declined from 20.9p to 17.4p but the interim
dividend is raised 3.8 per cent to 5.45p.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Two Hungarian banks said to be technically insolvent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY'S two largest commercial banks are technically insolvent and require
big injections of capital, according to a World Bank paper.
The two banks, both state-owned, are Magyar Hitel Bank, heavily exposed to
Hungary's troubled engineering industry, and Kereskedelmi Bank, main lender
to the country's drought-stricken farms.
Some of their problems stem from debts inherited from the communist period,
but others are more recent.
Both banks have suffered from bad debts caused by the three-year Hungarian
recession and a collapse in industry's sales to former Comecon countries.
Magyar Hitel Bank has Ft34.6bn (Pounds 253.2m) of loans classified as bad,
doubtful or substandard, according to the study. Taking these loans into
account, the bank has negative capital of Ft19bn, equivalent to 7.9 per cent
of its risk-weighted assets.
Kereskedelmi Bank has Ft26.3bn in classified loans, with negative capital of
Ft13.7bn, 8.5 per cent of assets.
The report, a World Bank internal aide-memoire obtained by the Financial
Times, says: 'At present, most of the banks are technically insolvent
according to internationally accepted accounting standards.'
An infusion of Ft100bn of new capital is required to bring the banking
sector's capital up to 4 per cent of lending, the target the World Bank
recommends. Half of the new capital is needed for the two big banks.
The plight of the banks came as little surprise to Budapest's close-knit
financial community, which believes the two banks are 'too big to fail' and
will therefore be rescued by the authorities. 'A bank which enjoys the
umbrella of the state cannot fail,' said Mr Gyorgy Suranyi, managing
director of Central-European International Bank.
Mr Istvan Szalkai, president of Hitel Bank, expected little market reaction.
'The market has taken into consideration the bad results,' he said.
Interbank money market facilities available to the bank had shrunk by about
10 per cent, he said, reflecting lenders' unease.
Central bankers at the National Bank of Hungary professed confidence that
depositors, knowing the banks were liquid and would be recapitalised, would
not panic.
Bankers and officials also stressed that Credit Suisse First Boston, leader
of the task force on bank privatisation and source of much of the data in
the report, used conservative international accounting standards.
Hungarian rules are more flattering. Under Hungarian accounting principles,
the two banks still have positive capital.
Hitel Bank said its 1992 results would be substantially better than CSFB
estimates.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Troubles behind the red ink
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BEHIND the World Bank and International Monetary Fund's belief that
Hungary's big banks need rescuing are some compelling facts.
The capital of the two biggest banks - Magyar Hitel Bank and Kereskedelmi
Bank - is wiped out when international accounting standards are applied to
their bad loans. Economic output has fallen 18 per cent in the last three
years. The disappearance of demand from former Comecon countries has
worsened the recession.
In 1991 parliament passed strict new laws: on bankruptcy, causing about a
tenth of companies to go into liquidation or file for protection from
creditors; and on financial institutions, giving banks the incentive to
recognise bad debts.
Hitel Bank says its non-performing loans tripled.
The result has been a sharp credit crunch. Banks, faced with the need to
make huge provisions, have charged high real interest rates to maintain
margins and produce paper operating profits, estimated at Ft39.7bn (Pounds
293m) for the whole sector in 1992.
The average interest rate on short-term corporate loans was 28.2 per cent at
the end of 1992, compared with inflation of 21.6 per cent over the year.
The World Bank study concludes that 'the financial system is unable to
finance the transformation to a market economy'.
A one-off recapitalisation is widely seen as essential. Economic recovery is
still feeble and loan portfolios are deteriorating. Weaker banks are losing
their better clients to stronger ones.
Recapitalisation must also put the banking sector into condition for
privatisation before more of the potential acquirers lose patience and set
up local subsidiaries from scratch.
An injection of funds, however, would allow bank managers to escape the
consequence of past errors.

FT  20 MAY 93 / German steel chiefs attack EC

<TEXT>
LEADERS of the German steel industry expressed indignation and bitterness
yesterday at the failure of European steel restructuring policies in the
wake of the collapse of Saarstahl, the French-owned steelmaker in the
depressed German Saarland.
Thyssen, Germany's largest steel manufacturer, condemned the policy of
allowing continuing state subsidies to ailing producers, and said the rest
of the industry would be threatened if they were allowed to restructure
their debts.
The steel manufacturers' federation lashed out at the failure of the
European Community to curb production at Italy's state-owned Ilva and at CSI
in Spain, where the companies' debt burdens far exceed those of Germany's
private-sector producers. The industry condemned the policy of interfering
in free market competition to protect the weakest manufacturers.
The anger of industry leaders was matched by the bitterness of workers at
the Saarstahl plant, who blamed Brussels, above all, for the loss of their
jobs.
Saarstahl filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday night after France's
Usinor-Sacilor, which owns 70 per cent of the holding company, decided it
could no longer transfer funds to cover estimated monthly losses of DM30m
(Pounds 12m).
Hopes for an immediate rescue faded as both federal and Saarland authorities
said no new subsidies were available. Since Saarstahl first ran into
difficulties in 1978, it has received some DM3.7bn in direct subsidies, soft
loans and credit guarantees.
'We are the victims of the European Community's inability to devise a
coherent steel policy,' said Mr Werner Fries, an official of the works
council at the plant.
The statement by Thyssen underlined the deep concern at the heart of the
German industry over the crisis.
The company warned that if both Saarstahl and Klockner-Werke, the other
German steelmaker currently seeking a debt write-off with its main
creditors, are kept going artificially, it would have 'negative consequences
on the rest of theindustry'.
Thyssen employs 13,000 just in the manufacture of long products, like steel
sections, rods and wire, where EC overcapacity is greatest.
David Buchan adds from Paris: Usinor-Sacilor said it would have to take a
FFr1.4bn loss in its 1993 accounts, representing its loans to the
subsidiary, which would not now be repaid.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Smith rejects electoral reform: Party leader backs manifesto
commitment to referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday rejected a change in the way MPs
are elected, but said a referendum on elections to the House of Commons
should be a Labour manifesto commitment at the next general election.
In a separate move, he reduced the prospect of a damaging, perhaps
unsuccessful, confrontation with the trade unions at the autumn conference
over their links with the party, by proposing that individual union members
should receive full party membership at a reduced rate.
Another change would allow new members to take part in the selection of
candidates. This would enable Mr Smith to present the plans both as
one-member, one-vote for the selection of parliamentary candidates and as
involving union members in the process. He also urged a substantial
reduction in ordinary subscriptions as part of the campaign to increase
membership.
The statements came at a meeting of Labour's ruling national executive
committee, which discussed the Plant committee report on constitutional
changes.
The report recommends that elections to the House of Commons should be on
the basis of a supplementary vote system, through which second preference
votes can be brought into play if no candidate achieves more than half the
first preferences.
Mr Smith's comments contained comfort both for reformers, who believe the
referendum will keep up momentum for change, and for those who want to keep
the first-past-the-post system.
Almost all on both sides of the argument can agree that a possible change in
the voting system should be decided by the electors rather than the elected.
Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, accused Mr Smith of fudging the
question of union links, and passing the buck on electoral change.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said that his admission that
democratic change was on the agenda was 'a small step forward'.
Labour's electoral reformers such as Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and
industry secretary, said that it was now up to them to persuade Mr Smith and
others, but the party leader's words suggested that his opinion was firm.
'As the Plant Committee acknowledges, there is no intrinsically superior
electoral system and I see no reason why we should make a change unless the
alternative is clearly preferable,' he said. He emphasised his resistance to
any system more likely to produce coalition government.
Mr Smith's plans for internal reforms appeared to be succeeding in their aim
of assembling a consensus in support of the principle of one-member,
one-vote in candidate selection.
Mr John Prescott, a shadow cabinet member and a critic of the original
plans, said yesterday's proposals endorsed the more active involvement of
the unions in the party's decision-making.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Danes are rewarded for Yes vote with tax cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DANISH government yesterday brushed aside violent demonstrations sparked
by Tuesday's referendum result endorsing Maastricht, and as a reward for the
Yes vote announced a programme to stimulate economic growth and employment.
Riots briefly flared up again last night, when police fired tear gas at
about 200 stone-throwing protestors who had lit fires and smashed windows in
central Copenhagen.
Clashes on the previous night, described as the worst in Denmark's peacetime
history, had left 11 demonstrators wounded by police gunfire and 26
policemen injured.
The government blamed a small fringe group of militant squatters, known as
the BZers. Many of them are anarchists and other far-left militants who see
the plans for further EC integration as meaning tighter control of Europe by
conservative political and business interests.
Little damage was done to property, the main targets being the windows of
several bank branches and a few cars. The government insisted the attacks
did not represent the feelings of the vast majority of No voters.
In parliament, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Social Democratic prime
minister, condemned Tuesday night's riots.
The prime minister went on to announce that the government would slash
marginal income tax rates to bring them closer into line with the rest of
the EC.
It would also bring forward state investment plans to push up growth in
gross domestic product from under 1 per cent this year to almost 3.5 per
cent in 1994.
Mr Rasmussen said the signal from Danish voters was that Europe's political
leaders must close the gap that had opened between them and their
electorates over Maastricht.
They could achieve this by adopting pragmatic policies that tackled problems
such as unemployment, which had a direct impact on the everyday lives of
Europeans. 'We have to be more engaged,' he said.
Denmark's central bank cut the official discount rate to 8.25 per cent from
9.25 per cent and commercial banks made similar cuts in lending and deposit
rates, which had been held artificially high because of uncertainty over the
Maastricht vote.
The Copenhagen stock market, which had risen strongly in expectation of a
Yes vote, put on a further 2.3 points to close at 303.89.
Tax cuts aim to galvanise other EC member states to rally behind a beefed-up
economic growth package ahead of next month's summit in Copenhagen.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Sharp rise in US trade gap threatens tension with Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS of increased trade tension between the US and Japan rose yesterday
after an unexpectedly sharp rise in the US trade deficit to Dollars 10.2bn
(Pounds 6.6bn) in March, the biggest shortfall for nearly four years. More
than half the deficit was with Japan.
The overall deficit was up nearly 30 per cent from the shortfall of Dollars
7.9bn in February, mainly reflecting a surge in imports.
The deterioration is likely to prompt a sharp downward revision of growth in
the first quarter to an annual rate of 1.0 per cent to 1.5 per cent,
compared with an initial estimate of 1.8 per cent.
The bilateral deficit with Japan rose to Dollars 5.3bn before seasonal
adjustment. The next-largest imbalance was a Dollars 1.5bn deficit with
China.
Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, said the poor figures showed the
importance of pursuing 'expanded markets for our exports on all fronts'. The
US would press for 'prompt fiscal stimulus in Japan, market-driven exchange
rate corrections, and negotiations that remove the structural barriers to
improved trade between our nations.' On Tuesday, Mr Lawrence Summers,
Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, urged Japan to do more to
stimulate its economy.
The trade figures were the latest in a series of economic setbacks for the
Clinton administration. Reports last week of a jump in consumer and
wholesale prices rekindled fears of higher inflation. Speculation this week
that the Federal Reserve might soon begin to tighten monetary policy sent
long bond yields back above 7 per cent. Imports rose 9.7 per cent between
February and March to Dollars 49.2bn, a record in cash terms. For the first
three months, imports were 11 per cent higher than in the same period last
year.
As consumer demand was weaker than expected in the first quarter, many of
the imports were stockpiled by companies. Mr Brown said that indicated
import growth would probably decelerate in the current quarter.
But the underlying trends are not encouraging. Exports did better than
expected in March, rising 5.6 per cent to Dollars 39bn. But in the first
quarter exports rose only 2.4 per cent relative to the same period last
year.
Most analysts expect the trade deficit to widen this year, reflecting faster
growth in the US than elsewhere. In last month's budget, the trade deficit
was projected to rise to Dollars 110bn-Dollars 140bn next fiscal year,
against Dollars 84bn in calendar 1992.
Mr Brown's remarks prompted speculation that the US was again seeking to
curb the deficit by talking the yen up against the dollar. By close of
trading in New York the dollar had fallen to Y110.6 from the previous day's
close of Y111.47.

<TEXT>
Allied-Lyons must be distressed beyond measure at the publicity surrounding
its Pounds 200m convertible bond issue. The share price had already fallen
before the news inexplicably found its way into the weekend press. It jumped
over 2 per cent when no bond emerged with the results on Tuesday morning,
though the enthusiasm wore off during the day as the market began to suspect
that the issue was looming after all. The price fell sharply again yesterday
when it was finally launched. That sort of confusion occurs in a market
forced to rely on hint and innuendo. It would have been prevented if Allied
had come clean with a formal statement about its intentions. It would have
lost nothing by doing so once they had been leaked.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that, in stock market terms at
least, Compass is a business whose moment has gone. The Pounds 72m
acquisition of SAS's catering arm is an attractive enough deal and will
enhance earnings. The trouble is that at this point in the cycle contract
catering looks a trifle dull. Likely earnings growth in single figures and a
sub-market yield represent meagre attractions.
Compass must hope that disillusion with the financial constraints facing
many recovery stocks will encourage investors to return to its steadier
virtues. Such concerns will not be lost on Gardner Merchant as it
contemplates its eventual market debut.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is an odd state of affairs when tax considerations provide one of the
principal justifications for a rights issue. Yet oddity is something of a
speciality for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and the group's accumulated tax losses
represent one of its few financial strengths. The Pounds 73m rights issue
allows it to exploit them neatly to enhance earnings. Half the proceeds will
be used to reduce debt resulting in a smaller interest charge and lower tax
rate. About Pounds 19m will be spent buying out minority interests in
mainland European agencies. This, too, helps tax efficiency. Saatchi will
spend the rest improving service levels, upgrading its information
technology and expanding its international coverage. Expertise in the
Chinese market is all the rage, it seems.
So far, so useful. Sadly, though, Saatchi still has a poor trading story to
tell. Theoretically, advertising should be an early beneficiary of recovery
but there is not much sign of it yet. An additional worry is that the
Marlboro mayhem seems to have caused brand managers to reassess promotional
strategies, creating something of a hiatus in advertising spend. Saatchi's
wafer-thin margins provide little leeway should events again turn nasty.
Future profits will be drained by Pounds 25m of earn-out payments. That
provides all the more reason to seek value elsewhere. Gold Greenlees Trott
and WPP seem better poised.

FT  20 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: UK takeovers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nervous poorly-performing companies may be surprised but relieved by the
deathly quiet on the UK takeover scene. There is, however, little prey of
obvious value in the market. Since devaluation the FT-A All-Share index has
risen by 25 per cent. That figure masks an even stronger performance from
recovery shares: the FT-SE Mid 250 index has risen by some 46 per cent.
Such increases run well ahead of any likely improvement in corporate
earnings over the next 18 months. Economic growth may be sluggish, and much
of the easy cost cutting has already been forced on even the weakest
managements by the three-year recession. Under the circumstances, it is hard
for predators to justify paying hefty premiums for control.
Management psychology has also turned against bids after some scarring
experiences in the late 1980s. Many friendly bidders find that vendors are
still asking unrealistically high prices. Hostile bids, however, offer
little opportunity for due diligence examination of the target's finances,
increasing the risks at a time when buyers lack confidence. Bank finance is
hard to come by for cash bids - indeed some predators have risked losing
existing banking lines if they considered acquisitions. Paper bids are a
good deal harder to sell to sceptical institutions.
In any event, takeovers often feature much later in the economic cycle. Bid
activity last hit bottom in 1983 - some two years after the recession had
ended. But bids have not fallen permanently from fashion. Some institutions
regard a bid as the cleanest and most effective way to shake up a poorly
performing company. And doubtless a few situations still remain overlooked
by all but the sharpest eyes.

FT  20 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Off note from Bass
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bass has a disingenuous way of describing the beer market as subject to
increased aggression rather than a price war. But there is no mistaking the
gauntlet it threw down yesterday. With its existing market share of around
23 per cent, economies of scale from brewery closures and a balance sheet
strong enough to support more free trade loans, the chances are that it will
succeed in raising market share where others fail. The real question
concerns the cost. Some of that is coming through already.
Bass claims its underlying beer margins rose in the first half, but that is
before the Pounds 9m increase in the provision for bad debts. After the
provision, which must reflect its efforts to win new business, margins fell
to 8.7 per cent from 9.3 per cent. That sacrifice has, however, produced a
gain in market share of only 0.2 per cent.
Yesterday's 9 per cent fall in the shares may be a step adjustment to a
situation where Bass can expect little increase in earnings over the next
couple of years while other companies enjoy the recovery. But there are
other niggling worries which prevent the shares seeming much of a bargain.
These include the sudden need for a further Pounds 4.9m restructuring charge
in brewing, the downturn in European hotels, and - an issue the company
glossed over yesterday - the weakness in US hotel profits despite higher
occupancy and room rates. Since it is on such tricky ground, Bass might do
well to reconsider its refusal to split the roles of chairman and chief
executive.

<TEXT>
It sounds as if some of Argentina's overseas ambassadors may be an even
worse credit risk than the country they have been chosen to represent.
Buenos Aires' newspapers have been filled with reports that some of
Argentina's departing ambassadors have left behind hundreds of thousands of
dollars in unpaid debts.
Admittedly, part of the explanation has to do with confusion over
ambassadors' private and official expenses. Even so, the list of
ambassadorial debtors has set tongues wagging.
Ambassador Carlos Mandry, former ambassador to Bonn, is alleged to have left
Deutsche Bank with a Dollars 300,000 overdraft after he was recalled last
year. Ruben Cardozo left Paraguay and Dollars 230,000 in IOUs and the former
ambassador to The Hague, Julian William Kent, owed banks Dollars 100,000.
The Foreign Ministry is investigating but says that 'where spending was for
official functions, the debts were checked and paid by the ministry. But in
the case of personal debts, that's each ambassador's problem.'
Or, rather, each ambassador's creditor's problem.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Observer: Share drive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in golf clubs have long been traded in Japan - but the very idea
provokes splutterings of disapproval at most British 19th holes. That could
well change, though, if Simon Hampel (nephew of ICI's Ronnie) has his way.
The young Hampel has just set up a stock broker, Mercator International,
which aims to match buyers and sellers of shares in the Wisley golf club
south of London.
Built by British Aerospace's Arlington property subsidiary and the Middle
East-backed Mannai Corporation, Wisley has 480 shareholders. They have
stumped up Pounds 15m of equity over the last three years, at between Pounds
26,000 and Pounds 40,000 per head.
Under the rules of the club, a free market came into effect in January,
allowing the odd speculator and, it is rumoured, a few distressed Lloyd's
Names, to bail out.
The developers currently offer new shares at Pounds 35,000, but, if recent
transactions are anything to go by, Mercator may be able to do a better
deal.
With a few other clubs joining in, perhaps there is room for a European
version of the Nikkei Golf index, which is a recognised lead indicator for
the Japanese economy.

<TEXT>
Mark Boleat has been an extremely effective point man for Britain's building
societies and he stands as good a chance as anyone of making a success of
his new job as director general of the much larger Association of British
Insurers.
But one little known rule for this year's annual conference of the Building
Societies Association suggests that Boleat and his troops may not be quite
as concerned about the freedom of the press, which they have so carefully
cultivated over the years.
When the BSA got wind of the news that the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester,
Britain's sixth biggest society, had invited four journalists to join its
table of eight at next month's annual dinner in Brighton, the balloon went
up at Boleat's Savile Row headquarters.
C&amp;G, which was paying for its guests, was ordered to withdraw the invites.
The official reason was that the 'seating plan may seem a little unbalanced
if so many journalists are concentrated on one table'.
Observer can't wait to hear the reaction of Mick Newmarch of the Pru if
Boleat's officials try to vet his seating plan.

If Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, one of the world's biggest advertising agencies, can
get away with a Pounds 73m rights issue, it surely must be on the mend.
But it still can't afford to lose big name clients such as Mars, the highly
private confectionery and pet food giant which is fighting to stem the slide
in its share of many of its main markets. Indeed, Observer hears that
chairman Maurice Saatchi has been spending so much of his expensive time
buttering up multi-billioniare Forrest Mars that a number of Maurice's
colleagues have rechristened him Snickers Saatchi, after one of Mars' more
famous chocolate bars.
Better than Whiskas Saatchi, perhaps.

Officially, the Serious Fraud Office is doing everything in its power to
recapture fugitive entrepreneur Asil Nadir now holed up in northern Cyprus.
Secretly, however, the SFO may be less than heartbroken if Nadir does not
return. There may be nowhere to hold his trial.
The former Polly Peck chairman was due to stand trial in September in one of
the two courtrooms built specially to cater for the peculiar requirements of
long and complex fraud cases. The courtrooms used for the year-long Blue
Arrow trial and the Barlow Clowes prosecution, are in Chichester Rents in
London's Chancery Lane. But now it seems the building may be structurally
unsound.
The Department of Environment is concerned that the floor loadings may not
be up to building specifications. Investigatory work will start soon and the
hope is that any repairs can be done by September - if possible.
Just goes to show what can happen when the full weight of the law is brought
to bear.

GOOD NEWS, a positive message, a sympathetic audience: an after dinner
speaker could hardly ask for more. Yet the prime minister's speech to the
CBI dinner on Tuesday night came out like a damp souffle. Concocted from
cliche and assertion rather than reasoning, it failed to satisfy either by
force of oratory or strength of argument.
Mr Major is at his best in small gatherings, when his courtesy and decency
win friends. At the big set piece, he can be strangely uninspiring. His CBI
performance began with scars of recession, then waded through ripples of
recovery and tides of manufacturing output before gasping into a jungle of
enterprises choked by weeds, where he said industrialists were digging away
to cut red tape.
The poverty of expression obscures the fact that the prime minister has a
story to tell, especially before a group of industrialists. He shares most
of their views about free trade and deregulation, and - with the agony of
Maastricht nearly over - about Europe as well. The relevant government
departments are eager to talk constructively to business. And he no longer
has to feel embarrassed about economic prospects.
All that is needed is a sense of phrasing, a couple of good jokes and the
ability to pull the different strands of policymaking together into a
coherent and practical whole. Sir Ronald Millar made music for Mrs Thatcher,
not herself the most gifted of orators. Peggy Noonan did the same for
President Reagan. If Mr Major cannot discover a latter-day version, then a
sharp-eyed sub-editor and a dictionary of cliches would be better than
nothing. At least the dinner guests would then have longer to chat over the
coffee.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Personal View: The bureaucracy that stifles Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL ANGUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today, Britain's position in Europe is being damaged by a sense of false
nationalism which is out of place in a changing world. This needs to be
replaced by a sense of vision that certainly does not involve any real
sacrifice of our national identity.
Many people, including me, are old enough to remember the original
visionaries of the new Europe: Monnet, Schuman and, yes, Sir Winston
Churchill too. Of course they saw the considerable economic advantages of
closer association. But equally they saw a Europe unlikely to be riven by
conflict. A Europe with Germany as a central and involved member. A Europe
of independent nation states but with citizens with a broader and richer
understanding of each other, less likely to become hypnotised by old
nationalistic slogans.
There are few who would not subscribe to this vision. Yet today there are
many who feel an increasing hostility to the whole European concept. Why
should this be? The answer is one word - Brussels. Something has to be done
about Brussels.
Many people in business have a list of pettifogging regulations that have
emanated from that great bureaucracy. But these are just symptoms of the
general approach of the European Commission. Some of its members really do
want to interfere as deeply as possible in local national affairs. There is
a dirigiste philosophy that sometimes reminds one of Napoleonic edicts.
There is an arrogance that is totally out of place, particularly in a group
that has no elected status.
I would hazard a guess that many of them have lost touch with the citizens
whose interests they purport to serve, and especially with young people.
Brussels contains too many of yesterday's people with yesterday's ideas and
methods. Their motto seems to be: 'If it moves - regulate it; if it doesn't
move - regulate it.'
Industry is not well-served by Brussels. We seem to spend too much of our
time fending off new forms of centralised social or industrial legislation
and regulation. And while this is going on there seems to be studied
indifference in the Community to the problem of European industrial
competitiveness, as indicated by Europe's loss of share of world exports of
manufactured goods from 22 per cent in 1980 to 18 per cent in 1992. And even
when this point is addressed, some of the proposed solutions seem strangely
like protectionism. I sometimes fear that Brussels would ideally like to
organise European industry as well as it has organised European agriculture.
This is no reason to abandon the single market as the so-called
Euro-sceptics would wish. Rather it is a challenge to modify the Brussels
approach so as to give primary emphasis to European industrial
competitiveness.
The principle of subsidiarity, with its genesis in the Maastricht treaty, is
precious and needs to be refined and extended. It is clearly in harmony with
the mood of Europe's people. Brussels must not be allowed to water it down
or lose it under a load of bureaucracy. It is not the function of Brussels
to trample over considerations of national tradition and working practices.
Nothing would be more welcome to CBI members than a simultaneous
announcement that parliament had ratified the Maastricht treaty and that a
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade accord had been concluded.
But the point about worldwide free and open trade is that it has a positive
effect on competition. So we have a vital need to be competitive. And we
need to be aware of this need as a community.
The CBI's message to European governments and to the Commission is that
there is serious work to be done on identifying the sources of Europe's
overall loss of competitiveness and eliminating them. That is why we have
persuaded our sister federations in Unice, the European employers'
federation, to undertake a study of declining European competitiveness,
focusing particularly on the impact of high social costs and emphasising the
importance of avoiding further 'own goals' through the social chapter, or
other related legislation.
It is clearly in the interests of British business that the Maastricht
treaty is ratified. Britain needs its government to be at the heart of the
negotiations, ensuring that its concerns are taken into consideration,
constantly improving and updating the single market and making it work
fairly. And, I would add, curbing the power of the Brussels bureaucrats.
This article is based on an extract from the speech by Sir Michael Angus,
president of the Confederation of British Industry, at the CBI's annual
dinner on Tuesday

FT  20 MAY 93 / Last stand before sell-off junction: The concerns underlying
a possible Tory backbench revolt over rail privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British have an attachment to their railways out of all proportion to
their willingness to use them. Leaving aside the 426,000 season ticket
holders who commute daily into central London, most people who own cars (and
many who do not) hardly take a train from one year to the next. Yet they
regard railways in much the same way as people with private medical
insurance regard the National Health Service - they want them to be there,
just in case.
It is a rash government, then, that dares to tinker with the trains, as Mr
John Major is finding to his discomfort. Even before the heavy Conservative
defeat at the Newbury by-election and county council polls a fortnight ago,
the planned privatisation of British Rail had been dogged by concerns about
the possible implications for fares and services. Now, with Conservative
backbenchers in no mood for measures that could further reduce party
support, the government is facing the possibility of a revolt when the
Railways Bill reaches report stage in the Commons next week.
On the face of it, this is an avoidable crisis. The rebellious backbenchers
say that are not seeking to wreck the legislation; they simply wish to make
it more palatable by building in safeguards to protect rail users'
interests. But the backbenchers' move raises at least two questions. First,
are their fears about the possible consequences of privatisation justified?
And if they are, can the legislation be amended without involving the
government in an embarrassing climbdown?
Underlying the widespread concern about the government's plans for the
railways is the fact that this privatisation is unlike those that have gone
before. The gas, electricity, water and telecommunications industries were
profitable and expanding when they came to the market, so their
privatisation was not accompanied by fears of reductions in services. Rail,
by contrast, is a heavily loss-making industry in long-term decline, and
most of its services exist only because they are propped up by the state.
People understandably fear that, if exposed to the full force of commercial
reality, the railways would have a very short future.
The government has attempted to address these concerns by adopting a hybrid
approach to rail privatisation. Only the freight train operations are to be
sold outright. The infrastructure - the tracks and signalling - will be
hived off to a new state company called Railtrack, while the operation of
British Rail's passenger services will be contracted out to whichever
private sector operator bids the highest sum for the franchise (or, more
likely, bids for the lowest subsidy).
It follows that what is going on is not a privatisation in the accepted
sense. Freight aside, virtually no assets are to be sold. In terms of
day-to-day operations, the railways will be more highly regulated than ever
because of the need to supervise private-sector participation through two
new bodies, the rail regulator and the franchising director. And since
nearly everyone involved in running the passenger railway will remain
beholden to the government for subsidy, ministers will retain the right to
go on meddling in the railways' affairs at every level.
The implication is that the new structure will make little difference. Yet
it will bring at least one fundamental change - in the way government
subsidy is paid. Under the present system, British Rail is paid block grants
each year to cover the costs of operating its loss-making Network SouthEast
and Regional Railways divisions, without anyone being aware of exactly where
the money is being lost. After privatisation, the profits and losses of each
individual route will have to be identified so that would-be franchisees
know how much to bid for them. The result could be to show that some lines
are losing so much money that the case for closing them becomes
irresistible.
There is another aspect to the subsidies issue. As long as British Rail is
running the railways, the costs imposed by the loss-making lines are
partially relieved by the surpluses produced by the profitable routes. Under
the new system, the surpluses generated by the profitable services will be
pocketed by the companies that win the franchises to operate them, but the
public sector will still be paying subsidies to the franchisees running the
loss-makers. Perversely, the result is likely to be that privatisation
increases rather than decreases the net cost of the railways to the
exchequer.
How will the government respond to these pressures? The answer is that
nobody knows. In theory, the upward pressure on subsidies should be
counterbalanced by cost savings resulting from efficiency gains. But the
government has given no indication of how great it expects those cost
savings to be, nor how it will react if they are insufficient to stop
subsidies rising. Is the Treasury going to write a blank cheque guaranteeing
that all services will continue to run and that fares will stay unchanged?
Since the answer to that question is no, then what?
It is this chasm of uncertainty that has given rise to the fears being
articulated by Conservative backbenchers. In order to bridge it, they are
seeking guarantees that passengers will be protected from line closures,
fare increases and the abolition of the London Travelcard scheme. They also
want an amendment to the Railways Bill allowing British Rail to bid against
the private sector for the passenger service franchises.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, seems unlikely to yield on any
of these issues. Where line closures are concerned, no transport minister
would promise to keep all railway lines open forever, with or without a
blank cheque from the Treasury. As for fares and Travelcards, the amount of
regulation facing train operators is already in danger of deterring would-be
entrants to the market, and any further inroads into companies' commercial
freedom could be in danger of turning rail privatisation into a dead letter.
Instead, Mr MacGregor might attempt to defuse backbenchers' concerns through
reassurance. Successful private-sector train operators will be those
providing services that people want to use, he is likely to argue, so they
will have a commercial incentive to offer more and better trains at
attractive fares. The purpose of privatisation is the expansion of the
railway, he could say, not its contraction.
It sounds convincing. It may even be true. But it is not the same as saying
that railway privatisation will be painless. By introducing transparency to
the allocation of subsidies, privatisation will confront politicians with
awkward decisions about the future of unprofitable services. The bureaucracy
needed to administer the Travelcard, student railcard and other schemes
requiring revenue to be split between several different companies would be
costly to run and is unlikely to appear unless someone volunteers to pick up
the bill. Some train services will improve, others will disappear; some
fares will go up, and others will come down. There would be no point in
privatising the railways if nothing changed.
It is this point that explains why the backbench amendment least likely to
be accepted by the government is the one proposing that British Rail should
be allowed to bid for franchises. Conservatives supporting the idea say it
is absurd that the people who know more than anyone about running the
railways should be prevented from throwing their hat into the ring. The
government counters that the point about privatising the railways is to get
the running of the trains out of the public sector, but emphasises that
existing rail staff will be strongly encouraged to take part in the process
through management/ employee buy-outs.
In fact, there is another aspect to the British Rail argument. Experience in
Sweden has shown how nationalised railways tend to win nearly every time
when competing with the private sector for contracts to operate train
services. The suspicion is that they do so because they are able to
cross-subsidise the contracted-out services with revenues from their other
operations. It is not hard to imagine how such a process in Britain could
result in the majority of contracts going to British Rail, so reducing the
privatisation process to a paper exercise that resulted in everything
staying the same. For nervous Conservative backbenchers with an eye on the
next election, that might be no bad thing.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Leading Article: China's landing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RISING CHINESE inflation and discreet expressions of concern by officials
are reminders that Deng Xiaoping's economic miracle remains vulnerable to
familiar constraints. Since Mr Deng began to dismantle state control of the
economy in 1979, there have been three spectacular booms, of which the first
two were followed by busts. The question to be answered in coming months is
whether reforms have progressed sufficiently for the economy to escape the
roller-coaster and make a soft landing.
After Mr Deng's call for faster growth and reform was trumpeted last year as
Communist party policy, the economy grew 12.8 per cent. Fixed asset
investment grew 38 per cent, and banks' new loans were more than double the
government's target. Latest figures show distinct signs of overheating.
Urban prices in April were rising at an annualised 17 per cent rate and
retail sales at 25 per cent. Surging domestic demand pushed the trade
balance into a Dollars 1.7bn deficit in the first four months of the year,
and the currency has weakened on the unofficial market.
In 1988 the cycle led to urban inflation of over 30 per cent, panic buying
and hoarding. The brakes were slammed on with tight controls on credit,
prices and imports. There is no sign yet of such a crisis, or of a heavy
hand from government to deal with the problem. Officials have indicated that
they want to direct credit to areas such as transport and energy in such a
way as to avoid inflationary bottlenecks, and a repeat of the late 1980s.
Several factors point to a greater chance of a soft landing than was
previously possible. Inflation is partly due to the one-off effect of price
deregulation for some 600 commodities. Until the most recent figures,
consumption growth has not appeared too rapid. The development of the market
economy reduces fears of shortages of basic goods, and increases the
available investment options. Price decontrol and trade liberalisation have
made the economy much less rigid. Foreign debt is not excessive and foreign
exchange reserves are strong.
However, the difficulties of moving from communism to the market are
underlined by weaknesses in fiscal and monetary policy. Though the
inefficient state sector now accounts for only about half of industrial
output, it still contributes to a large budget deficit and a big dollop of
monetary creation. The tax system needs reform to reflect the growth of the
non-state economy. The central bank has only blunt instruments to control
credit, with interest rates playing virtually no role. Planned deregulation
of financial markets, with the monetary authorities setting base interest
rates, may come too late to help in this economic cycle.
The ability to manage the economy is therefore severely limited.
Macro-economic control is made harder by the devolution of power to
provincial governments anxious to join in the development race. China's
leaders face huge challenges in continuing to guide the economy towards the
market while keeping in check the social problems thrown up by reform.
Foreign investors need to keep in mind the limitations of economics, and
also those of politics - the fundamental priority of China's leaders is to
remain in power.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Get Europe to work
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MANY months the European Community has been paralysed by the long
struggle over the Maastricht Treaty of European Union. When it ends, with
ratification in the British parliament, the governments must put aside all
those sterile doctrinaire arguments about the long-term destination of the
Community. Their top priority is to turn their attention to a pragmatic
programme of action, which will make it work more effectively now, in
economic and in political terms.
The most urgent need is to make the Community work in ways which seek and
secure the consent of the people of Europe. The first referendum in Denmark,
the debates in the French and British parliaments, the opinion polls in
Germany, have all shown that there are deep popular misgivings in many
European countries about the Community and its policies.
These misgivings have been stirred up in part by the fact that some
governments, and the Maastricht treaty itself, may have seemed to imply,
incautiously and quite prematurely, that Europe was necessarily bound for a
federal future. But there are two other more immediate reasons for popular
disquiet which are also much more practical: on the economic front, it has
not always been clear that the Community's policies were delivering the
advantages claimed for them; on the political front, governments have failed
to develop appropriate policies of transparency and accountability to ensure
that they carry the voters and their elected representatives with them.
The most immediate problem arising from the Maastricht treaty concerns the
future of the programme for economic and monetary union. The experts have
declared that there is nothing inherently wrong with the exchange rate
mechanism, despite last autumn's upheavals in the currency markets, which
forced two Community currencies out of the system. The fact remains that it
is now impossible to believe that the Maastricht programme for EMU will be
implemented as prescribed within the periods laid down. Moreover, it is
probable that some Community currencies will stay outside a monetary union
for a long time, and some may stay outside the ERM for a long time as well.
It is conceivable that an inner core group of countries may move ahead by
themselves towards closer monetary integration. But it cannot be a matter of
indifference to France or Germany that the British pound and the Italian
lira are floating independently, or that the peseta and the escudo have been
devalued. The urgent practical problem for the Community as a whole is to
review the monetary arrangements for Europe, so as to deal with the
probability of a variable geometry monetary Europe, and not simply dismiss
the outsiders as failures who should be disregarded.
One of the reasons for the unpopularity of the Community is that the
programme for the single European market has come to be identified with
industrial restructuring and thus with unemployment, while the convergence
criteria of the programme for economic and monetary union have been
identified with deflation and more unemployment. These criticisms may not be
fair, and they are certainly over-simplifications. The political fact is,
however, that high and rising unemployment is now the biggest problem facing
all European governments, and their most urgent need is growth and job
creation.
In the end, the only reliable basis for growth and job creation is improved
economic competitiveness. It is clear that the Community will not last long
if it comes to be seen as a vast machine for creating unemployment. But
there is no room for reckless indulgence in measures of social protection
which would jeopardise that competitiveness.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Letter: S African authorities must change rules of corporate
governance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEORGE R J GUISE and Prof ALAN WALTERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In our Personal View article of August 19, 1992 ('Feather beds in South
Africa's boardrooms'), we argued that shareholding arrangements,
particularly pyramiding and the ubiquity of de facto voteless shares, should
be changed so that the great South African conglomerates were subject to the
discipline of takeover bids, and that this would be likely to lead to the
unbundling of many a bloated corporate structure.
Now we have the first big unbundling of Gencor which is rightly welcomed in
your editorial, 'Unbundling' (May 12), as a first step in releasing South
Africa's economy from the stranglehold of the few who control the large
holding companies. The shareholders of Gencor are the immediate
beneficiaries, but the ensuing improvements in efficiency will benefit both
workers and customers as well.
But Gencor's unbundling, probably encouraged by a newly enlightened tax
regime, occurred in spite of a structure of securities law (and exchange
control) which still allows, even encourages, concentration of management
control in few well-sheltered hands. The remaining conglomerate managements
can still lie snugly in their feather beds safe behind the barriers to
intruders. Indeed, Anglo American has announced that it intended to do
precisely that. The Gencor components will still be largely free from threat
of takeovers both domestic and foreign.
The South African government and the stock exchange authorities should
change the rules of corporate governance and open all South African industry
to domestic, and eventually, through abolition of exchange controls, foreign
takeover bids.
Only then will a free competitive South African industry thrive in an open
environment and provide the prosperity on which its political as well as its
economic future depends.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Letter: UK industry in jeopardy from regulators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir IAN WRIGGLESWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In 1975, 35 per cent of Britain's northern manufacturing employment was
in shipbuilding, steel and coal. Today it is less than 3 per cent, and if
Swan Hunter and the final round of pit closures go ahead, it will be even
less. But the north is still a premier manufacturing region and exports 45
per cent of its GDP. It has world-class businesses in new areas such as
semi-conductors, automotive products, pharmaceuticals and service industries
and has combined traditional strengths with new and sophisticated uses of
modern technology in industries such as engineering, steel and chemicals.
One of these world-class businesses - BNFL - is being prevented from
contributing to the wealth, employment and exports of the region because it
cannot begin to undertake the Pounds 9bn of export orders in the Thorp
reprocessing plant in Cumbria.
The plant, completed at the end of last year, has still not been authorised
to operate - a situation you rightly described as 'a nightmare' ('Nuclear
scheme that became a 16-year Whitehall nightmare', May 8).
Most industrial plants require authorisations from regulatory bodies such as
HMIP, MAFF and the NRA which are set after they have been built, but before
they can start operation.
If, as has been suggested, these bodies should now also consider the 'need'
for new plants once they have been constructed, we are on the route to
industrial disaster. What responsible board would authorise expenditure on a
big new industrial plant if it is to be subject to the double jeopardy -
after obtaining planning permission - of facing the possibility of a
decision by a whole series of regulators as to whether there is a 'need' for
it before it can start to operate.
Regulators need to work more closely with industry, not against it. If
current laws are stifling business in this way, it is incumbent on the
government to change them quickly.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Book Review: Flops at the top of corporate Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER

<TEXT>
NIETEN IN NADELSTREIFEN
Deutschlands Manager in Zwielicht
By Gunter Ogger
Droemer Knaur, DM38, 272 pages
The typical west German senior manager is male, aged 40 to 65, ambitious,
incapable of real teamwork, insecure to the point of paranoia, incompetent
and probably corrupt. So, at least, argues Gunter Ogger in a book which
seeks to prove with a wealth of anecdote that virtually all top German
managers are Nieten - 'flops'. The title translates roughly 'Flops in
pin-stripe suits: the twilight of Germany's managers.'
It is managerial failure, Ogger claims, rather than broader macroeconomic
trends, which lies at the root of Germany's current economic malaise. This
irreverent argument challenges the self-esteem of German business leaders
who, until the present downturn, basked in the belief that they, more than
any other class in German society, were responsible for the prosperity of
the federal republic.
As that prosperity has started to look fragile, and Germany finds itself in
its worst recession since the second world war, Ogger's book has captured
the mood of the times. It has become a best seller, appealing to the German
habit of self-excoriation and providing a 'rogues' gallery' of failed
business leaders.
His argument accords with the views expressed by a small but vociferous band
of shareholder activists who have been trying to start in Germany the kind
of debate over 'corporate governance' which has taken place in the UK and
the US.
Whereas the mechanism of the hostile takeover serves to punish UK and US
managers if they are slow to deliver short-term financial performance, their
German counterparts are insulated from stock-market pressure by networks of
cross-holdings and other devices designed to remove the threat of unfriendly
take-overs.
Only very rarely do these protection mechanisms fail - such as last year
when Hoesch found itself being taken over by the rival steel company Krupp.
But most big companies enjoy shareholder 'stability' which leaves managers
free to treat private and institutional shareholders as little more than an
occasional fund-raising source.
The system also leaves managers free to pursue ambitious expansion plans
without taking into account such pedestrian short-term considerations as
profitability.
Ogger cites the example of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial
company, where annual sales have expanded to nearly DM100bn since Edzard
Reuter took over as chief executive in 1987 - but profits have dwindled to
an expected DM1bn this year.
'Until 1985, it was the most solid, most profitable and best managed company
in the whole of the Federal Republic of Germany,' he writes, 'but now
Daimler is battling with enormous structural problems and must lay off staff
for the first time since the war.'
Another example is Mannesmann, the engineering group, where annual turnover
has doubled to DM24bn under chief executive Werner Dieter, but profits have
fallen to less than half their former levels.
Such companies provide classic examples of how German capitalism has worked.
Managers are appointed and their performance monitored by supervisory
boards. The two-tier board system - which divides responsibility between the
management board, on one hand, and the supervisory board, on the other - is
often cited as an important reason for Germany's post-war economic success,
worthy of imitation in the UK and the US.
But Ogger contends that the supervisory board system has degenerated into a
clique of some 200 ageing men working together to perpetuate each others'
power and perks - a 'you vote for me and I'll vote for you' influence cartel
which has failed to prevent poor management decisions.
One consequence is the misallocation of financial resources - one reason why
the German economy is heavily weighted towards moribund sectors such as cars
and capital goods. The successes which the German economy can claim, Ogger
says, are due not to managers but to well-educated technicians, craftsmen
and engineers who build good products in spite of management.
Drawing almost exclusively on secondary sources, Ogger's analysis makes no
pretence of being fair. It is an entertaining harangue which might have been
balanced by greater attention to the failings of the Anglo-Saxon system -
for example, the questionable efficiency of takeovers as a way of dealing
with managerial ineptitude.
It does not tackle the anomaly that, although the shareholders are not the
first priority of management, the German system can still produce superb
returns for them. Allianz, the giant insurance company, pursued a
questionable expansion policy throughout the 1980s and, until recently, put
little emphasis on explaining itself to institutional shareholders. Despite
this strategy, it was the best-performing German share over the past decade.
Nor does the book offer any compelling solutions to the management problems
which it identifies, beyond citing a few truisms imported from US management
gurus. It suggests, somewhat forlornly, that German companies should try to
become leaner and fitter and German managers more honourable and less
bureaucratic.
Sheer commercial and economic pressure, however, is forcing German companies
to find their own solutions. Rationalisation has become the order of the
day, as witnessed by Ferdinand Piech's tough regime at Volkswagen. Daimler's
recent decision to abandon the holding company structure which served as its
chief anti-takeover device and seek a listing on the New York Stock Exchange
shows that managers will have to come out from behind the barricades if they
are to have access to the world's largest capital pool.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Letter: 'Best guess' of profits better than analysts'
estimates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN GALLINI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Following the public censure by the stock exchange of London
International Group ('Crackdown on private briefings for analysts', May 15),
is there any overwhelming reason why companies should not publish a 'best
guess' profits and earnings per share estimate for the coming year at the
time of their preliminary results statement, updated if necessary at their
AGM and on publication of their interim results? Only if the company
considered that the actual results were likely to differ by more than a
given amount (say 10 per cent) from their latest estimate, would they be
required to make a statement to the stock exchange. More frequent
information would not only help reduce the number of profit warnings made,
with the associated stigma and often devastating effect on share price, but
would also ensure that the playing field was seen to be level.
Far from diminishing the role of the analysts, who are after all at liberty
to publish their estimates, it would perhaps free them a little from number
gazing and allow them to concentrate more fully on areas of concern to
investors about which the company itself cannot be expected to be entirely
impartial, for example its strategy, competitive position and management
quality.
It would also help in placing a realistic value on the shares of the many
small companies not covered by analysts' research, perhaps even enhancing
the market for them. John Gallini,

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STANLEY GALE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The leaking of price sensitive information by companies seeking to
avoid surprises by giving guidance to analysts can be avoided by issuing
profit statements and relevant comment on a quarterly basis.
The practice, followed by the great majority of UK companies, of reporting
twice yearly creates an information gap of some eight months between the
announcement of half-year figures and the issue of the preliminary profit
statement for the full year. Quarterly reports, issued about mid-way through
the following quarter and containing comment on current trading and the
outlook, in practical terms virtually eliminate information gaps.

Sir, You report that the British government is expected to announce
retaliation against US companies by cancelling their right to refunds of
part of the tax credits attaching to dividends paid by UK subsidiaries ('UK
poised to retaliate against California tax rules', May 13).
It is worth noting, however, that the UK legislation only applies to those
companies based in a state which operates a unitary taxation system or has
companies in its group which operate from such states. Those US companies
with UK subsidiaries which do not operate in unitary states such as
California would not be affected by the proposed retaliation.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Economic Viewpoint: 'Socialism' and human nature
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As no worthwhile comment on the course of the British economy can be made
before today's unemployment figures, I am leaping in to fill this space with
a more fundamental argument: namely why 'socialism' - in the original sense
of comprehensive state ownership and direction of the economy - has proved a
delusion.
The most popular argument, especially among businessmen, is some version of
the incentive argument. Socialism would be wonderful, it is said, but people
do not work for idealist motives and require something more tangible. The
whole avuncular approach is encapsulated in the awful saying: 'Anyone who is
not a socialist before 21 has no heart. Anyone who is still a socialist
after 21 has no head.'
This kind of critique must have been heard by generations of students; and
it makes little appeal. It generalises too freely about human nature and
ignores many humdrum types of unpaid work, such as routine charitable and
social work, regularly and competently performed by thousands.
The basic argument against full-blooded socialism has little to do with
selfishness. It is that without a functioning 'capitalist' market even the
most noble-minded would lack the information to go about their jobs
effectively.
The reason can be put into a few sentences. Efficiency is not just a
technical concept. There is an unlimited number of ways of producing
anything: skilled workers with complicated machines can be employed, or
unskilled workers with simple machines. Should word processors or
typewriters be used, and which type? Should desks be of wood or steel? Is a
head office a good idea, or can managers link up from their homes? There is
no end to such questions.
But without a pricing system, which tells us about the relative scarcity of
these different inputs, a manager cannot begin to act rationally. Nor are
the resulting losses trivial. The capital intensive, but wildly unsuitable
and heavily polluting, industrial plants dotted about the landscape of
eastern Europe are testament to the costs of an inadequate pricing system.
Although the above critique is sometimes called the 'problem of socialist
calculation', it is not a dry accounting matter. The price system - by which
is meant not the rate of inflation but relative prices - incorporates the
dispersed knowledge of millions of people, which is fed into the economic
system in terms of the prices they are prepared to pay for different
resources - or charge for their own inputs. A command economy throws this
data away.
The main originator of this informational critique of socialism was Ludwig
von Mises, an Austrian-born economist who lived from 1881 to 1973. But after
enjoying a vogue in the 1920s and 1930s Von Mises faded out of the view of
mainstream economists who wrongly believed he had been answered.
A new book makes a comparison with Karl Marx. Both thinkers 'combined
erudition with a combative, frequently vituperative style of presentation,
displaying in their writings little patience with critics. They each
attracted a small, industrious band of dedicated disciples prepared to brave
 -and reciprocate - the disdain of conventional thinkers.'
This is a passage in From Marx to Mises by David Ramsay Steele (Open Court,
La Salle, Illinois). Steele was a British Marxist in the 1960s, then became
a Mises disciple. He is now a Chicago publisher and more sceptical of both
teachers but still impressed by the 'socialist calculation' critique. He is
thus well qualified to summarise the debate and put it into perspective.
The Mises critique does not apply to many who call themselves socialist but
really believe in welfare capitalism. Although Mises was opposed to this as
well, his critique, as Steele rightly says, fails to demolish it. But for
most of his lifetime, fashionable ideas went much further. They included the
view that factor markets and financial markets could be replaced by
conscious planning, as in war, and that intervention could be made at will,
for example, by fixing any and all prices at any level the government
chooses
The easy rejoinder to Mises is that full-blooded socialism could not be
impossible in view of the Soviet Union's 74 years of existence. A
sympathetic reading of Mises is that he meant that rational calculation was
impossible under socialism. What he really tried to disprove was the claim
of socialism in its heyday that it would not only be more just, but would
also provide at least as high a level of welfare.
Indeed Mises conceded that socialism might work in a very static society,
where techniques changed little, so that the discovery function of the price
system was unimportant. It might also work for ascetics not too worried by
material prosperity. As for the Soviet economy: it could function as well as
it did because it made use of the prices established in western markets.
Indeed there was a late book by Stalin urging the comrades to follow the
commodity markets more closely.
Eventually, however, revisionist socialists in the west and reform
communists in the east embraced prices and markets. In recent decades most
students of political economy have been taught not to refute the Mises
critique, but to say that socialist economies both need and can have
functioning markets and that ownership is irrelevant. The approved answer in
a multiple choice question for students devised in the early 1970s in
relation to Soviet bloc reform was: 'A freely-operating market system can
perform efficiently the function of allocating scarce resources to satisfy
competing wants under socialism as well as under capitalism.' This glib
approach still governs most of the debate on privatisation.
Why then were the reform communists of the 1970s and 1980s mistaken and why
could not effective markets be created among largely state-owned industries?
Mises' most convincing answer was the absence of financial markets -
including a market in ownership - to determine who should control existing
assets and to what uses new savings should be put. It was the absence of any
mechanisms for placing ownership and control with those who could make most
effective use of the assets at their command, which was probably the fatal
blow to reform communism. Hence the present emphasis on privatisation. As
Steele says: 'Human kind doesn't yet know of any feasible way to elicit,
transmit and to bring to bear this information in a technologically-advanced
society other than by substantially free financial markets in the milieu of
substantially private ownership of the means of production.'
From Marx to Mises is not a perfect book. Its main fault emerges in the
preface where Steele writes: 'In all essentials this book would be the same
if the Soviet debacle had been complete in 1921; or if it had been delayed
for another 20 years after 1989.' The length of time the USSR existed and
the nature of its collapse matter for assessing the importance of the
fundamental weaknesses, which no amount of general argument can replace.
By far the best section is that in chapter 10, summarising the modern
analysis of property ownership as bundles of rights which may change their
composition. Ownership is a matter of degree. Just as restrictions in
capitalist countries (for example rent control) may dilute the content of
ownership, so de facto property rights can emerge in a nominally socialist
country, as the managers of enterprises acquire more and more rights,
whether legally or otherwise. If Steele had followed up this line of thought
he might have reached interesting conclusions on whether, for instance,
'nomenklatura capitalism' is better than slow privatisation in the former
communist world.
The author's own ending is quite different. It is a call for more rather
than less utopian speculation. Although socialism has ineradicable flaws,
there may be better conceived alternatives to capitalism. If Marx and his
followers had not arrogantly dismissed as 'unscientific' all speculation -
other than their own asides - about the society of the future, we could have
been spared some misery.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Arts: The Makropoulos Case - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David Pountney's staging of The Makropoulos Case seems to have been in the
repertory of one or other of the British companies ever since it was first
seen in Glasgow 12 years ago. It has come back to Scottish Opera now to end
the company's season. Sally May has directed the revival, John Mauceri
conducts his last show as music director. A production that was for so long
dominated by Josephine Barstow's Emilia Marty now has Kathryn Harries in the
central role, and it is she who finally makes the evening a truly memorable
one.
Certainly the early indications were not auspicious. There is something
rather tired-looking now about Maria Bjornson's designs, which conceptually
seem already to have been consigned to a departed age of opera production,
though whether that feeling is fuelled by nostalgia or hard-headed realism
is difficult to determine. In the opening scenes too the show itself seemed
rather over extended, as if this were one revival too far; it took a while
for the direction to establish itself, for the playing to cohere and for
what turned out eventually to be some very well observed characterisations
to make themselves felt.
Most surprising was Mauceri's lack of assertiveness in the first act. The
orchestral playing sounded tentative, only hanging on to Janacek's exposed
lines by the skin of their teeth. It was not until the conductor began to
relish the tendrils of Straussian lyricism which buoy up the confrontation
between Emilia and Prus at the climax of the second act that his part in the
performance began to matter; from there to the end of the opera he provided
a surging, vivid orchestral canvas.
Ms Harries too only gradually took charge. She certainly needed to pace
herself for the challenge of the last act, but nevertheless seemed rather
reticent through much of the first, often masked by the orchestra (which, a
sign of insecurity perhaps, was consistently too loud) and swallowing her
words. Thereafter she was transformed, wonderfully vivid in the sharpfire
exchanges of the second, mingling flashes of fierce temper with glimmers of
the vulnerability that would make the final scene deeply affecting.
Instead of the Barstow hauteur, Harries offers a feckless disregard and an
absolute lack of moral centre. That is tempered by a sweetly turned sense of
comedy - wonderful drunk acting] - which seems a new element in her stage
persona. All the while the vocal lines gradually gain steadily in power and
authority, the tone colour deliciously varied, and the cruel extremes of the
last act were all handsomely negotiated.
The gallery assembled around this fascinating portrayal had their own
individual strengths. Nigel Robson's bumbling Gregor suffered most from the
over strenuous orchestral playing early on but gradually established the
character in rich detail, Donald Maxwell's Prus was authoritatively grasping
and manipulative from the start, with exemplary diction. Nigel Douglas
contributed a typical Hauk-Sendorf, Stephen Bennett a convincingly uptight
Kolenaty; there was a nicely turned Dresser from Margaret Izatt, a usefully
gormless Janek from Iain Paton. Any Makropoulos production, though, finally
stands or falls by the strength of its Emilia Marty, and in this case there
is no doubt of its success.

THE ABYSS: SPECIAL EDITION (12)
James Cameron
NOWHERE TO RUN (15)
Robert Harmon
PASSENGER 57 (15)
Kevin Hooks
I WAS ON MARS (15)
Dani Levy
When it was first released in 1989, The Abyss was a half hour away from
being a very strong movie indeed. Its writer and director, James Cameron,
seems to have realised something was amiss and has now used the clout he has
garnered from making Terminator 2 to have the movie released in a special
edition, or director's cut. The idea is that the decision of his studio's
marketing people to alter the film to make it more audience friendly is
thereby reversed. Unfortunately, Cameron's final version is a half hour
longer than the original, when what the film always needed was to be a half
hour shorter.
For those who missed it in its first incarnation, The Abyss portrays a group
of likeable redneck divers whose underwater oil rig is commandeered by the
US navy to rescue a sunken nuclear sub. Matters are complicated by the
fraught marital relationship between the chief divers (Ed Harris and Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio), the insanity of the navy commander (Michael Biehn),
a looming hurricane, encroaching Russians and, finally, a colony of
underwater aliens. It was the last ingredient that ruined the recipe the
first time around, transforming what might have been a taut, sweaty
adventure flick into a ludicrous fantasy feature.
Unfortunately, Cameron's new version expands on this very aspect of the
film, further padding out his picture with a tendentious morality play in
which world war III is averted by these squishy ETs when they unleash giant
tsunamis on the superpowers to make them put their nuclear weapons away. The
resulting blend of dated and simplistic cold war politics, overwhelming
special effects and sentimentality thoroughly undermines the two hours of
skillful action and suspense that preceded it, forcing one into the rather
alarming conclusion that those chop-happy studio executives might not be so
purblind after all.
Cameron's special edition also calls into question the whole recent trend of
director's cuts, which, with the exception of last year's restored Blade
Runner, seems to be little more than yet another way Hollywood is trying to
have its cake and eat it too. After all, film-making is a collaborative
process. What does the future hold - actor's cuts? cinematographer's cuts?
The only thing you can be sure of is that the studios and the producers will
certainly be getting their cuts, both times around.
If there were such a thing as an audience cut, Nowhere to Run would be five
minutes long. One minute for the amount of time Rosanna Arquette spends
naked, the other four devoted to Jean-Claude Van Damme as he ruptures the
spleens and deviates the septums of various baddies with his vaunted martial
arts. As for the remainder of the film, it is hard to see who the makers had
in mind as potential viewers when they consigned it to celluloid.
The plot, such as it is, has Van Damme playing an escaped con who holes up
on the farm belonging to a noble widow (Arquette) being threatened by greedy
real estate developers. After the obligatory rocky start to their
relationship, Van Damme and Arquette soon fall into the sack and then join
forces to see off the bad guys.
Nowhere to Run is the latest step in the effort to domesticate the Belgian
bruiser. As such, it is a resounding failure. Unlike Schwarzenegger or
Willis, Van Damme is utterly lacking in charisma, his bland stoicism failing
to suggest anything other than, well, bland stoicism. He is unable to
humanise his macho antics with the sort of self-deprecating wit needed to
break free of the straight-to-video category. To makes matters worse, his
toned down and surprisingly lacklustre fighting here should prove a
disappointment to his regular core of fans. And as for Arquette, it is sad
to see this once promising actress reduced to playing little more than
bearnaise sauce to Van Damme's slab of beef.
It is easy to see why a video star wants to go upmarket. What is harder to
figure out is why the fine film actor Wesley Snipes wants to travel in the
opposite direction. After a series of roles that put him well on the way to
becoming one of the most popular black leading men of all time, Snipes finds
himself up in the air in Passenger 57, a hackneyed action movie that might
have given even Van Damme pause.
The story has Snipes playing a former cop turned airline security consultant
who locks horns with a 'sophisticated British aristocrat' (Bruce Payne) who
also happens to be a lunatic with a penchant for blowing up 747s. What
results is so laughably ill-conceived that you keep on expecting Snipes's
agent to burst out of one of the hijacked plane's toilets and force the
whole thing to make an emergency landing. Unfortunately, it keeps on going
right up to the bloody finale, in which, ironically, Snipes fights with far
more aplomb that the new model Van Damme.
I Was on Mars is the story of Silva (Maria Schrader), a young Polish woman
who arrives in New York with plenty of dollars but apparently little in the
way of motivation or common sense. She wanders aimlessly about the city for
a few days, only to be relieved of her cash by Alio (Dani Levy), a slick con
man with a line of patter only someone fresh off the boat could buy. Not one
to take this sort of thing lying down, Silva decides to pursue Alio, soon
involving herself in his bizarre existence and exacting a subtle yet telling
revenge.
Fans of Stranger Than Paradise and Johnny Suede will find themselves on
familiar turf here, though the film lacks the bizarre sublimity of those two
efforts. Director Levy has a wonderful eye for detail - Silva carries an
iron in her briefcase but only one change of clothes, while Alio garnishes
his cocktails with Twinkies. And Schrader's Silva is a memorable creation, a
woman who uses passivity as a weapon more effective than anything the men
she finds herself among can employ. But the film fails to establish a
consistent comic pitch, undermining its fine observation and
characterisation with an unevenness worsened by a tendency to indulge in
weirdness for its own sake.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Arts: Von Otter and Tan - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the Wigmore Hall on Tuesday, Anne Sofie von Otter sang Haydn, Mozart and
Schubert to Melvyn Tan's 'fortepiano' (a modern copy, I think). The hall was
packed, of course; this young mezzo is nowadays a universal favourite, and
Tan is the man to persuade us that period Lieder - from, say, Schumann and
Loewe back - are best accompanied on a period piano. At the end,
nevertheless, when Miss von Otter was cheerfully guying both her Haydn
encores, the recital seemed to have been less than the sum of its parts.
She was in lustrous form. There are voices that sound best in the Wigmore
simply because they do not carry as well in larger halls, and other,
grand-opera ones that need to be kept on a tight leash. Von Otter's is one
of the lucky few that can sound unstintedly vital and vibrant there, and
still listener-friendly. Her programme culminated with Haydn's 'Ariadne on
Naxos' cantata, which she delivered as a towering dramatic scena: certainly
it bounced off the back wall, and yet it left no bruises on the ear.
Earlier she had delivered Schubert's 'Erlkonig' with comparable force and
intensity - though the tiny, wheedling voice she adopted for the erl-king
himself was too much of a conscious trick. The real revelation of that
performance was owed to Tan: viz. that a 'fortepiano' can do its brilliant
utmost with Schubert's desperately taxing accompaniment, where a pianist
with a modern grand can never afford to let rip for fear of drowning out the
singer. What that illustrated was no quaint, trivial advantage for the
old-style instrument (such as every great song-composer until Wolf and
Debussy had in his mind's ear), but a serious modern challenge.
If fearsome problems of balance in many Lieder simply evaporate when the
right kind of piano is in play, why should we go on assuming that for
general purposes there is no alternative to the 20th-century grand? Pianists
will say: with the big hi-tech instrument, we get subtler note-by-note
control of the sounds we make. But before Wolf and Debussy, do they need
such hyper-refined control?
Von Otter's other best Schubert was the little 'Romance' from Rosamunde,
delivered with lovely simplicity, along with the Gothic narrative of 'Der
Zwerg' (a newly popular rediscovery). Though never far below her best,
technically she slipped more often than she needed to - as did Tan. In
Mozart she scored several near-misses on quick springs to high notes, just
as Tan let his fluent fingers skitter over too many of Mozart's notes, and
even sometimes the basic beat.
His solo offering, Haydn's A-flat Sonata (no. 31, by the Robbins Landon
count), was too bonelessly pretty and unstructured to make its proper mark,
and his rhythmically wayward reading of Schubert's 'An die Musik' was less
pointful than just fitful. Though most of his accompaniments were brighter
than that, one had expected more sober penetration, and was therefore just a
little disappointed.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Arts: Mounted in the Garden - Cabaret theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Mounted in the Garden' could only mean that Kit and the Widow, that most
scurrilous of double acts, have re-tied their bow ties, ironed their tails,
and assembled a melange of songs, old and new, to subvert the nation. It is
the perfect late night entertainment at the Donmar Warehouse and places a
substantial whoopie cushion under the worthy Covent Garden Festival.
Over the years the relationship between the two has shifted. Kit
(Hesketh-Harvey) is still the masterful head prefect, but marriage has
exposed a softer side, adding to the repertoire not only a double-edged love
song, but also a nursery lullaby, an ABC of African animals. The Widow
(Richard Sisson) still looks like a Victorian curate with flatulence but he
now occasionally leaves the piano stool to tell, with studied diffidence,
risque jokes.
The basics stay the same - mordantly witty songs, performed with camp
bitchiness. Thankfully some of the old faithfuls are retained - the old
queens having a furious row on the way to Glyndebourne; the hundreds of
Norwegians doomed to travel for ever on the Bakerloo Line with Peer Gynt;
Kit resolutely refusing to get into bed with Madonna.
But the poisoned pen has moved with the times. Let's hope the Queen never
gets to hear 'Cheer Up, Marm'; it could convince her to call the whole thing
off. There is also one of those cabaret songs that harks back to Duggie Byng
and pre-war supper club days, 'Geoffrey Porlock the Warlock', whose
Wednesday evenings at Datchett near Slough sound decidedly messy.
What is remarkable about Kit and the Widow is that they manage to insult all
the totems of their fans and leave them desperate for more abuse. The City
types bay loudest at the pastiche of the Eton Boating Song which finds them
dangling in the Old Bailey on fraud charges; the Sondheim freaks accept the
total demolition of their god with well controlled hysterics. Kit is so much
one of us, when he forgets to be one of them, that he provides the perfect
escape for subversive thoughts. It may well be forgotten in the cool night
air but for an hour or so we have smashed the establishment and had a
smashing time, too.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Arts: Music for the thinking man - London Jazz Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a time when jazz music was easily identified by its
instrumentation, syncopation or its nervy improvisation. But contemporary
music has become harder to label and today's venn diagram of jazz contains a
perplexing number and diversity of sets. From hiphop to hardcore and new
music to world music, everybody wants a piece of jazz and jazz wants a bit
of everybody else. But if the argument over whether the interchange dilutes
or strengthens the jazz tradition is as long and circular as an Evan Parker
soprano solo, what is certain is that festival programmers have an ever
widening spectrum of possibilities from which to choose.
The London Jazz Festival, which winds down this weekend, has ranged from
scientific abstraction to the loping riddim of reggae via explosive fusion
and the effing and blinding of rap. Yet one of the highpoints of the week
has been provided by the (rare) appearance of jazz music's master of
understatement, US guitarist Jim Hall. Ever the thinking musician's
guitarist, Hall has achieved a modest cult following for his quiet communion
with pianist Bill Evans, clarinettist Paul Desmond and the swaying reeds of
Jimmy Giuffre.
Joined on the altar of Islington's Union Chapel by the choice chords of
pianist Larry Goldings, Hall unfolded a succession of exquisitely fragile
arrangements that bound together beautifully with the minimum volume. 'This
next one,' he said to the sound of pins dropping, 'is a stretched out blues
with some funny notes in it.' So subdued and spacious was Hall's delivery
that applause for delicacies like 'Some Day' and 'My Funny Valentine' seemed
intrusive. His more swinging originals featured devastating technique and
razor rhythm delivered with similar nonchalance.
In stark contrast to Jim Hall's effortless enchantment of his audience,
pouting Brazilian salsa queen Tania Maria put a great deal of energy into
dissipating the electricity generated by an excitable crowd at The Forum in
Kentish Town the following night. Somewhat exposed at the keyboards
(electric and acoustic) in a trio alongside bassist Eddie Gomez and
percussionist Don Alias, Maria's hamfisted attempts at crowd control were
enervating. An early attempt to enjoin the party crowd in a clapalong
session failed when it became clear that Maria herself was unsure of the
time signature. Poor Gomez and Alias stuck doggedly to their groove as Maria
splintered chords and wailed hideously into the wraparound mike. At the
controls of a large and fast moving band, Maria's fiery fusion of Brazilian
dance music and jazz can be exhilarating; uncut it is more like salsa hell.
The four trombones (one a bass), three trumpets and various reeds of John
Surman's Brass Project provide the perfect antidote to this sort of
nonsense. Kicked along by a feisty rhythm section and all overseen by
director John Warren, Surman's swooping bass and alto clarinets, soprano and
baritone saxophones front a uniquely English and folky form of big band
jazz. But Warren's compositions, most of them new and premiered at the
Lilian Baylis Theatre, packed in well-sprung Ellingtonian themes, choral and
classical sentiment rounded off with an extraordinary arrangement based on
the music hall refrain 'My old man said follow the van . . '. Surman's own
soloing goes from strength to strength. His spiralling soprano helped by a
delay button was hypnotic, the dancing baritone set against ostinato brass
uplifting. The concert will be broadcast on Radio 3 on June 5.

ITV's interpretation of 'current affairs' is neatly defined by 3D (ITV,

FT  20 MAY 93 / Technology: Modern methods in the pipeline - British Gas
engineers are revolutionising east German home energy provision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Graham Moore started working on converting Leipzig in east Germany from
manufactured, dirty town gas to natural gas 25 years to the day after he
began the process in Burton-on-Trent in the UK.
While it took four years to convert Britain to North Sea gas, Moore hopes
that, by next year, he and teams of British Gas engineers working with west
German energy companies will have finished converting east Germany to
natural gas from Russia.
'We had more information about our customers when we started the conversion
in the UK than we have here now,' says Moore, who is a director of two
regional distribution companies in east Germany: Gasversorgung
Sachsen-Anhalt (GSA) and Gasversorgung Leipzig (GvL). 'We need to do 10
years' worth of improvements here in two years.'
British Gas engineers are helping to extend the east German gas grid into
rural outposts, while marketing colleagues try to convince east German
distribution companies to adopt a friendlier approach to customers.
British Gas has won 25 new contracts to revamp the east German gas business
this year following its acquisition of stakes in the two distribution
companies two years ago. Along with west German energy partners, British Gas
has run the two distributors since they were privatised by the Treuhand
agency.
British Gas has invested DM70m (Pounds 28.4m) developing the two gas
companies and plans a further DM30m until 1997. Its German subsidiary
expects a turnover of DM30m this year - double last year's level of DM12.5m
 -and wants 50 per cent growth next year.
A priority for the distribution companies is to update the local gas grid so
that natural gas from Russia and elsewhere can be carried to replace the
manufactured town gas. British Gas has also taken a strategic 5 per cent
stake in Verbundnetzgas, the east German gas transit company which carries
Russian gas to local distribution companies.
Moore's experience of converting the UK to natural gas is vital in setting
targets and priorities for the east German companies. British Gas has
introduced computer technology that helps with the planning of gas networks
and pipeline routes. This helps estimate the costs for a specific project.
One of the main tasks of western managers in the east German gas companies
is to establish priorities. 'We've got to decide where we're going and how
to get there. We agree that conversion from town gas comes first, and then
we work on extending the network,' Moore says.
The company plans to complete conversion to natural gas by the middle of
next year. Initially, the utilities expected the conversion process to take
until 1996, but the better organisation and focus that has come with western
planning methods has meant it can be completed two years earlier.
A system of cost-accounting - highlighting for managers where they are
spending money and where they need to cut costs - has helped east German
companies target their investment. Once projects get under way, British Gas
can offer the cost-saving technology it has used on similar work in the UK.
The company is also using its swage-lining process for plugging leaks in the
cast-iron old pipes - lining the old ones with a plastic skin without taking
the pipes out of the ground.
UK contracting companies, such as Steve Vick, are moving into Germany to
carry out work for British Gas. Steve Vick is using a rotamole system of
boring underground to lay gas pipes, which is cheaper and quicker than
digging up roads and causes less upheaval.
British Gas has also developed technical improvements to the way it digs
trenches for laying pipe. With equipment such as a rock-wheel, mole-plough
and chain trencher, the company has speeded up its trenching operations. The
rock wheel, which has teeth that dig into the road surface, can lay pipes at
up to 200 metres in an hour.
The company's efforts to link new parts of east Germany to the gas grid are
being rapidly outstripped by demand. Moore explains how British Gas is able
to tap into a vast unsatisfied demand for gas supply, adding around 15,000
new customers a year and converting 125,000 customers to natural gas last
year.
'The inquiry level is unprecedented, especially compared with the UK, where
we have to give up market share.' British Gas is being forced by its
regulators to shed part of its market in the UK to encourage the development
of competition.
The company has tried to win new customers by overhauling the east German
approach to customer service. One of the hardest tasks has been to convince
their east German colleagues that customers have a right to know what the
companies are planning to do and when.
'Part of our marketing drive has been to create a positive image for natural
gas by stressing its environmental advantages over town gas and brown coal,'
says Paul Roberton, planning manager of distribution and transmission at
GSA.
Natural gas is cheaper for customers who use it for heating, but slightly
more expensive for those using it just for cooking. But there is a high
degree of awareness about the environment in east Germany and a lot of
interest in environmentally friendly products.
'Before, all the east Germans could do was to fend off demand for gas - you
could only get a supply by queueing at the energy ministry for hours and
proving you had special needs, such as lots of children, or worked shifts,'
says Moore. 'Customers are amazed to see us coming to their villages with a
mobile office and information packs about what we're going to do and when.'

Lord Rees-Mogg, editor of The Times between 1967-1981 and recently making
his own headlines with his critique of prime minister John Major's
performance, is going onto the board of International Business
Communications as a non-executive director.
IBC, which runs conferences and publishes newsletters, saw its shares dive
to 1.6p at the end of 1990. 'We are quite pleased that the price has now
climbed to 8 1/2 p' says chief executive Peter Rigby.
But why should Lord Rees-Mogg, who sits on the board of GEC, be interested?
'He runs his own newsletter (Strategic Investment)' Rigby replies 'and he
takes an interest in newsletter subscription publishing'.
IBC's chairman was Sir Roy Watts, the former chairman of Thames Water who
died suddenly last month. The company says it is looking for a new chairman,
but that Rigby will assume the position temporarily.

<TEXT>
John Jackson, operations director of the Body Shop, the natural toiletries
and cosmetics group, has left the company after five years.
The company said yesterday there was 'no drama and curiosity' in his
resignation, which did not result from any disagreement. It said Jackson
felt he had achieved all he could with the company, and was looking for new
challenges, perhaps in the shape of a chief executive's position - a post
that is not vacant at Body Shop. Jackson was not available for comment.
Jackson joined Body Shop from Chesebrough Pond's, the cosmetics subsidiary
of Unilever, in 1988. He has been closely involved with the reorganisation
of the Body Shop into seven distinct divisions - comprising UK, US and
worldwide retailing, and the company's production and warehouse operations,
soapworks, make-up and cosmetics divisions - which was completed last
autumn. Body Shop said Jackson would continue to work with chairman Gordon
Roddick on the Big Issue, the magazine whose proceeds go towards helping the
homeless.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Technology: A different angle on an old problem - A look at
an Australian company which may have a solution to a three-dimensional
challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the arcane world of imaging techniques, there is no shortage of
researchers trying to crack the problem of producing three-dimensional
images which can be seen on a flat screen without the aid of special glasses
or visors.
Most of the big electronics companies have investigated the problem and
several techniques are being developed. All share a crucial problem, however
 -the image disappears or is impaired if the observer changes position.
The 'sweet spot' problem restricts the potential of such systems to
single-user applications such as computer-aided design, in which the screen
is viewed from a consistent angle by an operator who does not move around.
So far, the challenge of developing a three-dimensional system which can be
viewed from any angle in front of the screen and, therefore, by large
numbers of people watching from different angles, has defeated all comers.
However, a small Australian company called Trutan has produced a potential
solution which is regarded as promising by imaging experts at IBM, the US
computer company.
Trutan is an unlikely source of technological innovation. The company is a
joint venture between Arnotts, an Australian biscuit company, and Biceku, a
family company controlled by Donald Martin, a Sydney businessman.
In true inventor style, most of the development work has been carried out in
a couple of cramped rooms on an industrial estate in suburban Sydney by
Martin and Bjorn Olsson, a Swedish-born film technician.
Neither has a background in imaging technology, although Martin stresses
that some of the technical work was carried out by academic researchers at
universities in Cambridge, Melbourne and Brisbane.
Martin says he stumbled across the three-dimensional imagery system almost
by accident while trying to develop a large-scale projection system for use
by Arnotts in the kind of entertainment simulators now appearing in suburban
shopping malls.
So far, only one prototype has been constructed and that suffers from
technical defects - principally a lack of brightness - which make the image
appear dull and slightly fuzzy. Yet imaging experts who have seen the
prototype have been impressed by its potential. James Lipscombe, an IBM
researcher who specialises in stereoscopic imaging, says its defects are
minor and easily solved.
Martin says his research into visorless, three-dimensional suggests that
most researchers since the war have concluded that the idea was 'about as
feasible as perpetual motion'. But a post-war French researcher called
Francois Savoie invented a mechanical contraption called a cyclostereoscope
which produced partial three-dimensional images over a small angle of view.
Savoie's machine consists of a vertical axle with a wheel at each end and a
series of vertical strips fixed to the rims of the wheel. A small screen is
placed inside the ring of strips, on to which a pair of slide projectors
project separate left and right images. The photographs have to be taken
with a double lens camera - not in itself a technical problem.
When the machine is rotated, the vertical strips form a moving grid in front
of the screen which separates the image into alternate left and right
images, replicating normal stereoscopic vision. Martin's 'improved' version
of the cyclostereoscope produces a three-dimensional image with a near
180-degree angle of view. However, the image is weak, and is distorted by
the moving grid, which remains visible in front of the screen.
This problem is reduced when the image is viewed on a flat-screen computer
monitor situated behind a liquid crystal display screen - effectively an
electronic version of the cyclostereoscope. The computer is programmed to
display left and right views of slides in segments which are viewed through
a series of oscillating parallel bars on the LCD screen which match the
segments on the computer monitor.
The LCD grid oscillates at a rate which makes it invisible to the observer
while directing the left and right images to the correct eyes, producing the
three-dimensional illusion. It does work, at least with static images.
Martin claims the system could be adapted for use in broadcasting.
However, the company says the technical limitations of the present video
standard impose problems that are impossible to overcome - chiefly, a
noticeable flicker caused by the frame rate (the speed at which image frames
succeed each other on screen). This happens because of difficulties in
blending the left and right images and the oscillating grid when the image
changes. Research indicates that even high-definition television systems,
which use a higher frame rate than existing broadcasting systems, would
suffer from some degree of flicker.
Two possible solutions have been identified: restricting the system to
specialised, custom-made units with frame rates at least double the existing
standard; and developing a special monitor incorporating the LCD grid in the
screen.
In the meantime, the company claims several Australian companies are
investigating possible industrial applications for the system, such as
remote control of mining vehicles in dangerous areas.
However, Martin says the shortage of development capital in Australia means
the technology is likely to be sold to an overseas company for further
development.

FT  20 MAY 93 / People: Boleat's pro-active stance for the insurers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mark Boleat, who has won plaudits throughout the industry during his seven
years as director-general of The Building Societies Association, will be
lending his voice, from August, to an entirely different industry as
director general of the Association of British Insurers.
He says that after 20 years at the BSA he felt it was time to move on, the
attraction of the ABI being that it represented an opportunity to speak for
'a more complex industry' and to wield a budget six times as large.
'I didn't want to be stuck being known as someone who can do one thing only'
remarks Boleat, who has in the past been assumed to harbour national
political ambitions.
Indicating that it wanted a fresh approach to try and put behind it a string
of public relations disasters, the ABI engaged headhunters to find its first
director general. Boleat explains 'they want a much more pro-active stance,
with the ability to anticipate developments a bit more, rather than just
being responsive'.
Mike Jones, who joined the Life Officers' Association in 1968 and who has
been chief executive of the ABI since 1987, says he is leaving, 'looking for
fresh woods and pastures new.'
Boleat, 44, reckons his biggest achievement at the BSA and the Council of
Mortgage Lenders, of which he has been director general since 1989, has been
'to help make it the most effective trade body in the financial services
industry'. 'We have helped to create the right regulatory and prudential
framework for building societies. It is remarkable that despite (the
problems in the housing market) the societies have come through a bit
battered, but intact.' Analysts said that, while he could appear arrogant,
he had 'worked like a dog for the industry'.
'There are a huge number of regulatory issues, many of which will be
identical at the ABI, notably the establishment of the Personal Investment
Authority' Boleat adds. At the same time, he acknowledges that the interests
of the 450 members are much more diverse, with general and life companies
often having directly contradictory agendas.
In his new role he may also find himself doing public battle - where the
interests of insurers and building societies diverge - with his former
colleague Adrian Coles (right) who steps up from the position of head of
external relations to succeed him at both the BSA and the CML. Coles has
already won himself plenty of friends - 'quieter but with an intellectual
credibility second to none' was the comment of John Wriglesworth, housing
analyst at UBS.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Power of private
labels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In public, many manufacturers of branded products still treat retailers'
private-label rivals with disdain. Yet, in the UK at least, private-label
production has become so big a business that few companies can afford to
turn up their noses.
A recent survey* by Conzept International, a branding consultancy, of 200
UK-based consumer goods producers - half of them in the food and drink
industry - finds that fewer than a fifth derive less than 10 per cent of
their total revenues from private-label manufacturing.
Forty-four per cent of the companies said the business provided at least 40
per cent of their revenues. Fifty-eight per cent said it was a bigger share
of their total sales than five years ago. The main reason for private-label
manufacturing, mentioned by 30 per cent of companies, is to provide greater
security for continuing sales revenue, while 27 per cent cited the
opportunity to cover fixed costs.
The companies divided almost equally between those for which private-label
business consisted of producing cheaper copies of branded products or basic
products at the lowest possible price and those which aimed to make unique
products.
The survey underlines how far private-label business gives retailers the
whip hand in marketing decisions which manufacturers of branded products
have traditionally controlled. It finds retailers are more important than
manufacturers in controlling retail prices, advertising and promotion,
packaging and design and the size of product ranges. Manufacturers still
wield more control than retailers in the areas of distribution, delivery and
product programming.
Three-quarters of private-label manufacturers said their most important
market was the UK. But 18 per cent said it was western Europe - which 48 per
cent named as their second most important market.

</HEADLINE>

Sending bands of women in kayaks down the tributaries of the Amazon to sell
lipstick and face creams to remote communities would seem to be taking the
concept of direct sales to the extreme. Particularly if the communities do
not use money and can pay only with barter goods such as fruits, eggs, wood
or nuggets of gold.
Yet this is one of the creative methods used by the Brazilian subsidiary of
Avon, the US cosmetics giant, to make its products available throughout the
country's vast hinterlands and to maintain sales over the past three years
of recession.
As a result, Avon has become one of the few Brazilian companies to see sales
rocket as per capita income has dropped 10 per cent.
Ademar Serodio, president of Avon Brazil, explains: 'Research showed us
that, even in a crisis, there is always consumption.
'Our problem was to make people who had less money consume more.'
His plan to widen the sales net did not convince his head office, nor,
indeed, some of his employees. They believed cosmetics sales would be among
the first products to suffer in a deep recession and the company should
adjust to a smaller market.
After a six-month struggle, Serodio's masters caved in, agreeing in March
1991 to boost the sales force by 50 per cent and launch a series of new
products. The decision was a success, turning the Brazil operation into one
of the company's most profitable worldwide and the largest cosmetics company
in Latin America.
Sales rose from 180m units in 1990 to 220m last year. This year, revenues
are expected to reach Dollars 480m (Pounds 317.8m), against Dollars 350m in
1990. The workforce has increased 10 per cent and the factory is operating
at full steam, compared with an idle capacity average for Brazilian industry
of 30 per cent.
To achieve this, and increase the sales force, Serodio boosted the number of
sales catalogues to 1.2m, which he estimates are seen by 30m people.
This is a costly operation in Brazil, where high inflation means the
catalogues must be reprinted every 19 days, while the estimated inflation
rate is factored into the sales price to cover the grace period for payment.
Simply issuing new price lists did not work, says Serodio, explaining: 'The
catalogues are an essential tool of our salesforce in creating trust.'
Serodio also radically changed the system of incentives for sales people,
who work on 30 per cent commission. Rather than, as in the past, reward the
people who sell most, prizes now go to those who most improve their own
performance. Serodio explains: 'Under the old scheme, it was always the same
people who won, so it ended up not being an effective incentive.'
The Amazon sales are a result of a new flexibility to adaptation to local
conditions and the logistics problems of door-to-door sales in a country
larger than western Europe.
Serodio admits he is not sufficiently familiar with the currency of the
Amazon to judge how many breadfruit one needs to buy a lipstick or how many
blushers to a nugget of gold. But, having paddled back to Amazonian towns,
his sales women exchange the barter products for money and then pay Avon.
As a result, today in Brazil the Avon name may be known in places where even
the usually ubiquitous Coke has not penetrated.
Serodio explains: 'There is a cosmetics market everywhere, however
peripheral the place. Cosmetics are not superfluous products, but a
necessary part of a woman feeling good and being accepted by society.'
He points out that, when Avon opened a sales office in the poor
north-eastern state of Bahia in 1970, analysts claimed that the local per
capita income was too low for the purchase of cosmetics.
Yet the Sao Paulo factory was soon filling truck loads of products bound for
the interior of the state - one of the poorest parts of the continent.
Serodio says: 'I didn't believe it. It countered all my training as an
economist. So I went there and I found all these really poor people living
in mud shacks yet buying cologne in crystal bottles.
'It turned out that they saw them as a status symbol.'

FT  20 MAY 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Sticking to the
border - A look at the European expansion of Swiss retailer Migros
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Crossing borders has become second nature for many businesses, but not for
retailers. Companies that have exported a successful retailing formula are
few, while the list of failures, including the UK's Marks &amp; Spencer in
Canada and France's Printemps in Japan, is depressingly long.
Now, a new generation of retailers is trying again. Last December, Tesco of
the UK bought the 92-store Catteau chain of supermarkets in northern France.
Two months later, Kingfisher, the UK retailing group, acquired Darty,
France's largest electrical retailer. Ahold of the Netherlands, Aldi and
Tengelmann of Germany, and Promodes and Carrefour of France are among those
which have built up the proportion of their sales in other European markets
to more than 30 per cent.
The latest to join this trend is Migros, one of Europe's most powerful
retailers, but up to now active only in Switzerland. A federation of 12
co-operative societies, the company is building supermarkets in France and
Germany and is committed to taking a leading position in the Austrian
grocery market.
Its progress will be watched closely by other European retailers, after its
large success in Switzerland, where it has 23 per cent of the food market.
It buys more than 20 per cent of Switzerland's annual agricultural
production and, in line with its founder Gottlieb Duttweiler's policy of
reducing prices by cutting out the middleman, it manufactures about a third
of what it sells in its own factories.
Moreover, its method of expansion may prove a model. Having carefully
studied the failures of others, Migros believes the key to success, in food
retailing at least, is to stick at first to the regions around one's home
base. It also decided not to open its own stores in Austria, but rather to
form joint ventures with existing local retailers.
Eugen Hunziker, president of the Migros federation, acknowledges the biggest
mistake most retailers have made in cross-border ventures has been
underestimating the differences from their home market. Successful retailing
involves delivering the right goods and services to the local customer. But
differing tastes, cultures and climate mean the demands of customers vary
considerably in different parts of Europe. Moreover, different legislation
in areas, such as opening hours, planning restrictions, VAT and minimum
wages, can make operating conditions very different in foreign markets.
Even within the US where there are no significant linguistic or cultural
borders, national retailers, such as Safeway and A&amp;P, have been unable to
keep pace with regional specialists, argues Hunziker.
The challenge, he says, is defining which regions belong together.
Switzerland, for example, has three cultures clearly separated from one
another. Yet Migros succeeds in all, by carefully targeting its products and
offering them at aggressive prices.
Migros management knows its supermarkets are appreciated beyond
Switzerland's borders. German, Italian, French and Austrian consumers
regularly cross the border to shop in its stores.
Besides awareness of the potential pitfalls, Migros' cumbersome democratic
decision-making process within the co-operatives had previously acted as a
brake on cross border expansion.
But the pressure has now become irresistible. The group has limited
potential for growth at home and needs more outlets for its manufactured
products, including confectionery, pasta and hygiene products, if it is to
remain competitive.
With the creation of a single market in the European Community it looked as
if expansion into neighbouring countries could be approached gradually and
painlessly. Migros first dipped its toe in the water last year, launching
two supermarket projects in the French suburbs of Geneva and another in a
German suburb of Basle.
Then in December a majority of Swiss voted against joining the European
Economic Area (EEA), an expanded free-trade zone with the EC. That meant
that exporting from Switzerland would continue to be difficult and the group
would need a secure base somewhere within the EEA. The obvious solution was
to go to Austria. Austria will be a member of the EEA as well as having easy
trade relations with Switzerland through the European Free Trade
Association.
In March, Migros made a series of deals that would give it access to about a
quarter of the Austrian grocery market at a cost estimated by outside
analysts at more than SFr200m (Pounds 88.4m). It acquired the chain of 112
Familia supermarkets based mainly in the western Austrian province of
Vorarlberg from the Zumtobel group. It then formed two joint ventures with
Konsum, Austria's largest supermarket chain.
One venture, in which Migros will have a 75 per cent controlling interest,
will manage the Familia supermarkets and Konsum supermarkets in Vorarlberg.
It will have estimated sales of SFr200m and employ around 1,500 people. The
other, in which Migros has only a 25 per cent stake, brings together 78
Konsum supermarkets throughout Austria and the Familia shops outside of
Vorarlberg. It would have annual sales of Sch12bn (Pounds 690m) and employ
around 4,000 people.
Even expanding reasonably close to home, though, can lead to complications.
News of the joint ventures provoked an outcry from Austrian trade unions,
which claimed Migros' policy of manufacturing so much of its own goods would
mean the loss of thousands of jobs in Austrian manufacturing.
Hunziker dismisses the idea that Migros is going to divert Konsum and
Familia's existing supply and distribution networks to its Swiss sources,
although it is analysing the Austrian stores in detail to see which of its
own products it can sell, and how it can best take advantage of its
international procurement potential.
'We didn't go into Austria on our own, but looked for co-operation. We can't
transfer Migros philosophy and policy wholesale. The Austrians will tell us
what we can and cannot do,' he says. With that type of attitude, Migros may
stand a better chance than some of its precursors of making a success of its
cross-border ventures.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Accountancy Column: Time to ask who should audit the
government's auditors - The case for independent scrutiny of the UK's two
public watchdogs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARY BOWERMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DECADE after the creation of the Audit Commission and the National Audit
Office, the UK's two public audit watchdogs have clearly proved their worth.
But the time has come to question who audits the auditors themselves.
The National Audit Office and the Audit Commission audit the majority of
public bodies, with a remit to report on value for money and the figures in
the accounts. They are sometimes the taxpayer's only 'foot in the door' of
non-elected bodies such as the regional health authorities. Their
contribution to improving public sector management is widely acknowledged,
while the savings they identify more than cover their costs.
The Audit Commission was established in 1983 and is responsible for
co-ordinating the audits of and promoting value for money in local
authorities. In 1990 its duties were extended to include the National Health
Service, bringing the total level of expenditure under its scrutiny to
around Pounds 90bn. Some 70 per cent of its audits are undertaken by the
commission's own staff and the remainder by selected private sector
accounting firms it appoints.
The National Audit Office was established in 1984. It audits the accounts of
central government departments and many other public agencies. It also has
the power to carry out value for money audits of these and other public
bodies, such as universities. The total amount under scrutiny is Pounds
450bn.
The Audit Commission has been instrumental in causing change in the way
local government and latterly the NHS use their resources. It uses a
comparative approach to identify best practice which forms the basis of its
recommendations to all authorities. A recent report showed that Pounds 15m
could be saved if hospitals mended leaking pipes and used water more
efficiently. Another on public libraries showed the cost of issuing a book
is Pounds 6 at the most inefficient libraries.
The National Audit Office also has an impressive record in raising issues
ranging from how the Ministry of Defence could save Pounds 30m by better
utilisation of its housing stock, through to questioning the effectiveness
of cervical and breast screening. A timely report issued just after the
Windsor Castle fire revealed that inadequate fire safety standards in
government buildings had already resulted in losses of Pounds 8m and has
caused the Houses of Parliament to be refused a fire certificate since 1979.
Most of the National Audit Office reports are presented to parliament
through the Public Accounts Committee and are used to call to account the
senior civil servants responsible. Occasional television glimpses of these
officials squirming under interrogation can give a curious satisfaction and
sense of retribution. Real sadists can read the full transcripts published a
few months later.
But who audits the auditor? Are our auditors performing their role
effectively? Amid the hundreds of value for money reports published over the
last 10 years, covering thousands of public sector activities, not one is an
independent review of the performance of the public sector auditors.
While they have been expanding the scope and improving the standards of
public audit practice, the auditors themselves are still audited to only a
rudimentary, traditional level. The National Audit Office is auditor to the
Audit Commission and has the right to undertake a value for money audit, but
has never done so.
The two bodies need to liaise closely in some areas of their work. This
appears a rather incestuous relationship. A close scrutiny of the Audit
Commission by the National Audit Office would be likely to cause some
embarrassment on both sides.
The National Audit Office's own affairs are subject to more stringent
scrutiny. Its annual budget must be approved on behalf of parliament by the
Public Accounts Commission - a committee of MPs.
The Public Accounts Committee also questions the head of the National Audit
Office about planned expenditure and activities. Minutes of these
discussions are published but some of the more sensitive issues, such as
proposed pay levels and problems with office relocation, are censored.
A private firm of accountants - currently Clark Whitehill - audits the
National Audit Office and has undertaken some value for money reviews on
topics such as recruitment, training and accommodation. The results are
passed on to the Public Accounts Commission. But they have never been made
available to the public.
An open and independent appraisal might allay the concerns of critics over a
range of important issues.
Is the mix of staff appropriate? Auditors, mainly with a background in
professional accounting, are examining issues ranging from medical
procedures to road building. The US government auditors, by contrast, are
drawn from a wide range of professions.
Is productivity sufficiently high? The number of Audit Commission reports on
value for money in local government fell from 19 to 12 between 1990 and
1991. In 1991 it managed to deliver just 49 per cent of audit opinions on
local authority financial statements within two months of publication
deadlines, while its fee rates rose by 6.7 per cent - compared with
inflation of 4.1 per cent. In the same year, the National Audit Office spent
only 50 per cent of its budget on direct work on investigations. The rest
went on overheads.
Should more audit and value for money projects be contracted out? While the
rest of the public sector has been exposed to competition, the National
Audit Office spends just 5 per cent of its expenditure on contracted
services. The Audit Commission has always placed 30 per cent of audits with
private sector firms. This proportion has been static since 1983.
Is more attention paid to efficiency than effectiveness? Both sets of
auditors are constrained in the extent to which they can question policy.
This means that some of the really interesting questions are never posed. Is
audit coverage sufficiently integrated in programmes run through different
agencies? For example, how well do the auditors work together to assess the
impact of policies such as the development of a national curriculum imposed
by central government but implemented by local government and
grant-maintained schools?
The two audit bodies are, of course, experts in giving advice on the use of
resources, and they apply much of this knowledge to their own organisations.
The National Audit Office has a comprehensive resource management system
that feeds into a five-year corporate plan. This is published annually and
discussed by the Public Accounts Committee.
The Audit Commission has given its own - mainly glowing - assessment of the
impact of each of its publications since 1983 in 'How effective is the Audit
Commission?' It has recently invited comment on its new strategy document
'Adding Value'.
Both bodies have well-established quality-control procedures and both
publish annual reports which include performance indicators such as cost,
the number of accounts audited, the number of recommendations agreed to, and
an estimate of the value of savings identified.
This record of accountability is impressive compared with many other public
bodies. But it is internally driven. While the National Audit Office and the
Audit Commission have carte blanche to review and report on most of the
public sector, it does seem anomalous that they alone should escape
independent public scrutiny.
An independent body with an overview of both organisations would be the
ideal remedy. But there is no obvious candidate and this would require a
change in legislation. At a minimum the auditors should be subject to
periodic performance audits, with the results in the public domain.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs attack intervention in brewing
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ALL-PARTY committee of MPs yesterday slammed the government for meddling
in the brewing industry.
Intervention had caused 'unnecessary expense and turbulence' for brewing
companies and 'distress and uncertainty' for pub tenants, the agriculture
committee said.
In a critical report on government action following the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission 1989 inquiry into the industry, the committee said
consumers had gained little benefit.
A 17 per cent real increase in the price of beer since 1989 was 'a clear
indictment' of the effects of orders which forced national brewers to free a
third of their pubs from exclusive beer supplies.
'Far from increasing consumer choice within some regions, the effect has
been to increase the strength of some local and regional monopolies which
are just as pernicious, if not more so, as the complex monopoly allegedly
existing in the national market,' the MPs said.
Closures of rural pubs and the decline in the numbers of beers available
nationally were further signs of the failure of the policy.
The only 'unarguable success' had been the introduction of guest beers which
pub tenants were allowed to buy from brewers other than their landlords.
Questioning the need for the government's forceful intervention, which cost
the industry Pounds 500m in restructuring, the committee said: 'We consider
that reform of the licensing laws could have gone much of the way to
introducing greater competition with far less traumatic results,' adding
that such action should now be taken quickly. Much of the confusion within
the industry over the past four years could have been avoided if a clear
strategic path had been established from the outset, the report said.
But there was evidence that both the MMC and the government had failed to
understand the mechanics of competition in the supply of beer. The MMC's
strategy, directed towards brand availability and price, was bound to miss
its target; and there was no clear rationale for the government's course of
action.
The committee said competition and consumer choice should now be encouraged
without further intrusive and burdensome regulation.
The committee recommended a reduction in duties on alcoholic drinks to bring
them closer to EC rates and said it would be sensible to tax drinks on
alcoholic content.
The Brewers' Society welcomed the report which, it said, confirmed its view
that the MMC investigation and subsequent government orders 'reflected
poorly on the administration of competition policy.'

LIFE AFTER Maastricht. Denmark's endorsement of the treaty has provided the
occasion for predictably jubilant talk among ministers about lines now drawn
under a dismal past, the promise of new beginnings. They half believe it.
They will be more convinced when they can see also life after the reshuffle.
With the bulk of the Labour party abstaining, the government is promised a
comfortable majority when the Maastricht bill's third reading wraps up its
tortuous progress through the Commons today.
In spite of the promised thunder in the House of Lords from Lady Thatcher
and Lord Tebbit, the finishing post is now in clear view. The court cases
threatened by the Euro-sceptics may prove more of a nuisance than the
government will admit. So too might action in the European Court to
challenge the validity of Britain's opt-out from the social chapter.
But barring unexpected accidents - an essential caveat when writing about
the present government - by the end of July Britain should have caught up
once again with its European partners and ratified the treaty.
In spite of the venom of his attack on Mr Major, even Lord Tebbit sounded
yesterday as if he knew in his heart that the game was up.
The split in the Tory party over Europe will not go away. The
arch-Eurosceptics - Mr Major's very own Militant tendency - have detached
themselves from the Conservative mainstream. Sterling's exile from the
European exchange rate mechanism means that the destructive choice between
the slow and fast lanes of European integration has been deferred, not
removed.
The DM/Franc link has survived everything the speculators have thrown at it.
It provides the basis for a monetary union among the Community's core
countries. Mr Major underlined yesterday that there was no prospect in the
medium term of the pound's return to the system. Those in Whitehall who
remember the sterling crises which punctuated life before the ERM understand
the risks of remaining outside.
The prime minister has more immediate problems. His own authority has been
much diminished. His cabinet is deeply unsettled. His supporters on the
backbenches are ready to be tipped into panic again by the threat - albeit
at this stage slim - of defeat in the Christchurch by-election. He is also
being pressed to move quickly to remake his government.
The official line - that Mr Major is determined not be pushed into a
reshuffle by the media - is either understandably disengenuous or deeply
misguided.
It is true that some Fleet Street editors would be happy to claim the scalp
of Mr Norman Lamont. The chancellor's sometimes aloof manner and his habit
of writing nasty letters of complaint have left him few friends in the
press.
But this time the pressure from the media understates the manouevering in
the cabinet. If Mr Major decides against changes he will be ignoring the
advice of a majority of his colleagues. It must be assumed that Mr Norman
Fowler, the party chairman, and Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, have told
him so.
It is not a question of malice. Mr Lamont has been a shrewder, braver
chancellor than his public image allows. But in the words of a colleague, he
has been at the scene of too many accidents.
Mr Lamont does not want to go. He sees no reason why he should be the
scapegoat for the recession or for Maastricht. There are dark -
unsubstantiated - rumours that Mr Major's role in the ERM debacle would not
bear the scrutiny of Mr Lamont's memoirs.
The uncertainty is damaging the cabinet. Ministers are jostling for position
in case Mr Major opts for wholesale changes. Resentments are building up.
Mr Kenneth Clarke has emerged alongside Mr Douglas Hurd as an independent
force in the government. But the home secretary's habit of re-interpreting
economic policy during early morning chatshows has enraged Mr Lamont.
Mr Hurd is accused - unfairly - in the bars of Westminster of plotting
against the chancellor while his protege Mr Clarke bids for his job on
television.
Other relationships risk being soured by constant speculation about who is
on the way up and who might be on the way out. Mrs Virginia Bottomley's
trouble-free year at the health department has caused resentment among less
fortunate colleagues.
The right is asserting Mr Michael Howard's candidacy for No 11. Others, such
as Mr John Patten or Mr Tony Newton, have been unsettled by the inclusion of
their names alongside that of Mr Lamont on reshuffle 'hit-lists'. Discord
ripples through the middle and junior ranks of the party.
It cannot make for good government. One way or the other, Mr Major will have
to end the uncertainty soon.

<TEXT>
THE 'CHARTER' group of Conservative activists is calling for a formal policy
on donations to the party as part of its campaign to remove the secrecy
surrounding Tory finances.
In its seventh annual report on the party's income and expenditure Charter
says there should be limits to donations from any one source and sources
from which 'no donations at all are acceptable.'
It calls for 'a formal policy on this' approved by the party's central
council. 'The Conservative party . . . should not be financed by those who
have no vote in United Kingdom elections' or by 'excessively large donations
or loans from those who are not prepared to be publicly identified'.
The report comes as the party is showing some signs of greater openness in
its accounting. It decided earlier this week that it would publish a balance
sheet for the first time with its 1992-93 accounts in July.
However, current proposals stop short of advocating a breakdown of
individual donations to the party.
The report dismisses the party's new board of management - which met for the
first time this week and has been likened to a company's board of directors
 -as 'a sham'.
'The chairman of the board (Sir Norman Fowler - of course) is in no way
beholden to the board,' it says. 'The board's members are there at his
invitation and are wholly dependent upon his goodwill for the board to
function at all.'
Sir Norman owed constituencies 'a proper account for the damage that has
been done to the party's image by Central Office's spendthrift ways and the
carelessness with which they have accepted money from seemingly any source
at all in order to feed their addiction to profligacy'.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Revenue rapped over heritage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INLAND Revenue was criticised by MPs yesterday for failing to help
provide access for the public to land and artefacts of national heritage
exempt from inheritance tax.
During consideration of a National Audit Office report on inheritance tax,
members of the Commons public accounts committee said the Revenue should do
more to ensure people were aware of their rights to inspect countryside and

FT  20 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rail sale rebels step up pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE ON the government to consider changes to its rail privatisation
proposals mounted significantly last night when potential Tory rebels tabled
amendments they said would help make the measure more popular, David Owen
writes.
Eight Tories signed the amendments which will be debated next week when the
bill returns to the Commons for its report stage. Rebel leaders are expected
to meet Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, today to press their case.
The MPs' demands fall under three main headings: safeguarding concessionary
railcards, allowing British Rail to compete to run services, and formulating
a national plan for the railway network.
Ministers are determined not to give way over BR's ability to compete for
franchises.
In a letter to MPs, Sir Keith Speed - a former minister and rebel leader -
said: 'We have all seen in recent times what can happen to Conservative
party support if policies are embarked upon in an insensitive and
ill-thought-through manner.'

FT  20 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Iraq inquiry told of cabinet
disunity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER Trade Secretary Mr Paul Channon indicated yesterday that he may have
been unable to influence key decisions within government affecting the sale
of defence equipment to Iraq and Iran for which his department had statutory
responsibility.
Mr Channon told the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry that during his period as
secretary of state, from 1986-87, the Foreign Office and the Ministry of
Defence were interpreting government guidelines in a way he had not
envisaged.
The guidelines agreed to in December 1984 were intended to restrict defence
exports which could significantly enhance military capabilities and prolong
or exacerbate the Iran-Iraq war.
But Mr Channon commented on one case in which the export of hovercrafts to
Iran had been blocked not, in his view, on the basis of military criteria,
but because Mrs Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher, then prime minister, had not
wanted either to alienate the opinion of other arab countries or become
embroiled in the Irangate controversy which had surfaced in the United
States.
'I think (the MOD and the Foreign Office) were changing the rules as they
went along . . Although it was government policy, it was jolly irritating,'
he said.
Documents made available to Lord Justice Scott's inquiry team confirm that
by 1986 Mr Alan Clark, then serving under Mr Channon as trade minister, and
other DTI officials were arguing strongly for a relaxation of the
guidelines.
But Mr Channon said he had no record of some documents being circulated to
him. One which he could not recall seeing before yesterday was a minute
written by Mr Clark to Mrs Thatcher on November 24 1986 urging a relaxation
of the guidelines. The public hearings continue on Monday.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lilley denies closure threat to
rural post offices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN expanded range of benefits available for payment by automated credit
transfer was outlined by Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, in the
Commons last night when he denied that large numbers of post offices,
particularly in rural areas, faced closure.
He accused Labour MPs of mounting a 'scare campaign' about the threat that
the wider use of automated credit transfer for the payment of benefits into
banks and building societies posed to the post office network.
His renewal of earlier assurances that the government would maintain a
nationwide network of post offices failed to satisfy Mr Donald Dewar,
Labour's shadow social security secretary, and other opposition MPs.
Mr Lilley explained that all small post offices - in the region of 3,000 -
received a fixed sum regardless of the volume of benefit business, so their
remuneration would not be affected by more people switching to automated
credit transfer.
Girobank last night welcomed Mr Lilley's 'assurance that the government
needs the post office network to deliver benefits and that many millions
would still prefer payment across the counter'.
During the debate Mr Lilley said pensions, child benefit and disability
allowances were already available for payment by automated credit transfer,
and a start had been made in phasing in unemployment, income support,
invalidity and severe disability allowance.
He emphasised that the delivering of benefits was the biggest single item in
his department's operating costs (Pounds 650m a year).
Mr Jim Cousins, in the final speech from the Labour front bench, angered
Tory MPs by claiming that the government had 'chosen to make war upon the
sub-post offices'.
Mr Edward Leigh, junior trade and industry minister, said sub-post offices
were an integral part of rural and urban life, and the government intended
to keep them, but the network should be flexible.
He added: 'That does not and cannot mean that no post office will ever close
 -that would be absurd.'
He reaffirmed that the government's commitment to a nationwide network would
apply whether the future of the post office lay in the public or the private
sector.
The government won a majority of 36 (311-275) to defeat a Labour motion
condemning the uncertainty caused by encouraging the use of automated credit
transfers for the payment of benefits.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour highlights trade deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN HAS been running a deficit on its trade in manufactured goods for
more than a decade, Labour claimed yesterday, as it launched a concerted
attack on the government's manufacturing record.
The opposition used trade and industry questions to taunt a succession of
ministers over this deficit.
Labour's attack came within 24 hours of a pledge by Mr John Major, the prime
minister, to direct all of Whitehall's energy towards broadening the
economic recovery and strengthening the country's manufacturing base.
Opening the assault, Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary,
invited ministers to rebuke chancellor Norman Lamont for forecasting in his
March Budget that the manufacturing deficit would double this year.
Britain has had a deficit on its trade in manufactured goods every year
since 1982, Mr Cook said. He inquired how long it would be until the country
got back to the surplus which existed every year before the Conservatives
were elected.
He was supported by Mr Nicholas Winterton, Tory MP for Macclesfield, who
asked when Britain would start to reduce the deficit.
Challenged over last year's Pounds 2bn balance of payments deficit on cars,
Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, said the country could look forward to
'a steady increase in the number of cars sold in Britain that are produced
in Britain.'
He said it was important for Britain to avoid 'saddling' manufacturers with
the effects of the Maastricht treaty's social chapter.
Mr John Butcher, a former Conservative industry minister, urged the
government to abolish capital taxation 'within the lifetime of this
parliament.' Manufacturing was more capital-intensive than the service
sector, he said.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Directors deny greed over pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHLY PAID British bosses took cover yesterday after BTR chairman Sir Owen
Green attacked them for the size of their pay packets.
In an article entitled 'Greed: the curse that is corrupting Britain's
bosses', published in yesterday's Daily Mail, Sir Owen complained that top
people were awarding themselves rises irrespective of the performance of
their companies.
Speaking later he accused his peers of cowardice in their response. 'People
have been saying to me 'you are absolutely right' but they are not putting
their heads above the parapet,' he said.
Sir David Plastow, chairman of the remuneration committee at Guinness which
was recently criticised for awarding a 25 per cent pay rise to company
chairman Sir Anthony Tennant, was one of the few to mount a public defence.
'I am totally unapologetic,' he said. 'When Sir Owen says that chairmen are
paying themselves too much, he doesn't understand.'
Sir David described Sir Anthony as an 'entrepreneurial and marketing
genius', and said that his departing salary of Pounds 777,000 was determined
by an independent committee and reflected the exceptional performance of the
company.
'He (Sir Owen) also talks about chief executives being ordinary chaps. In
fact it is an enormously demanding and stressful job,' said Sir David, who
agreed in general that pay and performance should be more closely related.
Sir Owen, who is paid Pounds 217,616 by BTR, said the maximum salary for a
British chief executive should be 'around Pounds 500,000 for the top 10
companies in the country. It certainly shouldn't be Pounds 1m.'
Prudential and Tesco, whose highest-paid directors received Pounds 769,000
and nearly Pounds 1m respectively last year, were among the companies that
refused to comment yesterday.
ICI pointed out that the 25 per cent salary increase for Mr Ronnie Hampel,
who will be chief executive of the reorganised ICI, reflected his promotion
to a more responsible job.
Some executives said BTR should not criticise others as it had failed to
disclose in its 1992 accounts the Pounds 460,000 pay packet of chief
executive Mr Alan Jackson. Sir Owen said this was an oversight that would be
rectified next year.
But the Institute of Directors said yesterday: 'The fact that (Sir Owen)
takes a public stance is totally to be applauded.'
Mr Paddy Linaker, managing director of M&amp;G, the fund management group,
complained that very large pay rises 'create a bad image'.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Clarke firm on police reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE, the home secretary, yesterday sought to reassure police
officers that he shared their concerns while yielding nothing over his plans
for radical change in the service.
Speaking at the Police Federation conference in Blackpool, he emphasised
that it was the structure of the service that needed reform and 'not the
policemen and policewomen who work within it'.
But Mr Alan Eastwood, federation chairman, warned of deep anxieties and
sinking morale.' I have never known a time when the service, at every level,
has been so demoralised,' he said.
Mr Clarke has started restructuring police authorities to turn them into
smaller, more businesslike bodies and wants to streamline disciplinary
procedures making it easier to dismiss under-performing officers.
In addition, the results of the Sheehy inquiry into police structure and
reward due next month are likely to lead to the abolition of some senior
ranks and the introduction of performance-related pay.
Facing brief outbursts of jeers and heckles, Mr Clarke dismissed the view
that his proposals would increase central control of the service. He said:
'I intend to abolish many of the controls now applied by the Home Office and
let police managers get on with doing their jobs.' Chief constables would be
encouraged to delegate responsibility from their headquarters.
But Mr Eastwood said some people saw 'something positively dangerous' in the
home secretary's plans to reduce local authority representatives, replacing
them with government nominees and a Home Office-appointed chairman.
The new arrangements could be used 'in a dictatorial fashion', he said, and
there was a danger that chief constables who challenged government policies
might find themselves 'brought into line'. Mr Eastwood said police
authorities risked being 'reduced to a walk-on part' and Mr Clarke's
proposals resembled a Home Office takeover or a forced merger where all the
voting shares were held by the home secretary.
'I really do beg you not to press on regardless, impervious of local
opinion, dismissive of professional advice, lumping all criticism of your
grand design as the inevitable voice of special pleading. If ever there was
a time for a minister to listen it is now,' Mr Eastwood said.
Ministers are increasingly determined to take a tough stand on crime and Mr
Clarke said that in addition to amendments to the Criminal Justice Act
announced last week he would legislate soon to give the police powers of
immediate arrest when bail was breached and to bring squatting clearly
within the criminal law.
He also announced an independent examination of the amount of paperwork
imposed on the police by the criminal justice process.

FT  20 MAY 93 / CBI urges fresh growth strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry is to urge the government to construct
an industrial strategy based on strengthening the supply side of the economy
to achieve sustainable economic growth.
The CBI has been encouraged by recent ministerial language which is more
supportive of manufacturing industry, but it believes the government has
still failed to articulate a clear industrial strategy.
The employers' organisation has started work on a policy document intended
to define its view of the government's proper role in improving Britain's
competitiveness. It will also set out what the CBI believes to be the
acceptable limits of state involvement in supporting industry.
The CBI is anxious to discourage any suggestion of old-style state
intervention, but believes the government must make its central objective
the adoption of policies intended to help UK companies compete more
successfully. Business leaders complain that competitors in other European
countries receive far more assistance from government in winning vital
orders.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, yesterday made a preliminary report
on the issue to his ruling council, which will discuss it again later this
year after more detailed work has been done.
Mr Davies told a London press conference: 'We are trying to work towards a
definition of what government's responsibilities are towards industry.'
He said the government's prime responsibility was to provide a stable
economic framework for business. But beyond that it had to implement
policies which would raise the trend growth rate.
The CBI is to examine a series of policy areas in which it believes
government action should be taken to help improve national competitiveness.
They include public expenditure and taxation, education and training,
transport infrastructure and planning and business support services.
The European Community has lost one fifth of its share of world trade since
1980 and will lose more unless productivity improves and social costs on
employers are contained, the CBI council warned yesterday.
Members called on the EC to 'rethink its commitment to the social chapter
and to avoid directives which will further reduce competitiveness'.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Government borrowing rises by 34%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT needed to borrow Pounds 4.69bn last month to finance public
spending. This highlights the prospect of high deficits later in the year as
a result of the economic slowdown.
The high level of borrowing for April - which was up 34 per cent from the
Pounds 3.49bn figure for the corresponding month last year - came about
after allowing for higher-than-expected privatisation proceeds of Pounds
1.4bn.
Of the total borrowing requirement, central government needed to find Pounds
3.25bn last month to cover the gap between spending and revenues. Local
authorities borrowed Pounds 963m while public corporations took on an extra
Pounds 396m of debt.
In the three months to the end of April the total government deficit was
more than Pounds 19bn, indicating how the recession has eaten into tax
income.
Government and private-sector economists expect a deficit of about Pounds
50bn for the financial year ending next March, up from a revised Pounds
36.7bn for the 1992-93 financial year.
Central government receipts in April came to Pounds 17.88bn, with spending
totalling Pounds 21.22bn. In the corresponding month last year the figures
were Pounds 16.82bn and Pounds 19.66bn respectively.
Without the contribution from privatisation proceeds the deficit for last
month would have come to Pounds 6.06bn, after corresponding figures of
Pounds 10.94bn in March and Pounds 5.90bn in February.
About half of the Pounds 1.4bn privatisation proceeds in April came from the
third call in the sale of shares in Scottish electricity companies.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Measures which obscured the extent of joblessness
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NOVEMBER 1981: New rate of supplementary benefit introduced for men over 60
who had been on supplementary benefit for more than a year. No longer
required to sign on as available for work in order to receive the benefit.
Estimated to have removed 37,000 men from the claimant count over the
ensuing year.
October 1982: Registration at Jobcentres becomes voluntary. Count at
Jobcentres no longer provided a meaningful measure of unemployment so basis
of unemployment statistics switched to count of claimants at unemployment
benefit offices. This cut the count by 190,000 as a result of more
up-to-date record-keeping (-78,000), the exclusion of registrants not
claiming benefit (-135,000), and inclusion of the severely disabled
(+23,000).
Budget 1983: About 162,000 men, mainly over 60, allowed to receive national
insurance credits or the higher long-term rate of supplementary benefit
without needing to attend an unemployment benefit office.
September 1988: The Social Security Act changed the benefit entitlements of
under-18s, removing an estimated 90,000 from the headline total.
July 1989: Redundant Mineworkers Payment Scheme changed so that people
covered by the scheme no longer need to sign on as unemployed and available
for work in order to receive scheme benefits - 15,500 estimated to have left
the count as a result.
October 1989: Social Security Act makes receipt of benefit conditional on
claimants proving they are actively seeking work. It also provided that
after a permitted period the level of remuneration will not be good cause
for claimants turning down or failing to take advantage of an employment
opportunity. Unemployment Unit calculates this led to a fall of 50,000 on
the monthly count.
December 1989: Changes in the way earnings affect unemployment benefit.
Part-time or casual workers earning enough to pay national insurance
contributions in any week denied unemployment benefit for the week.
Unemployment Unit estimates this led to fall of 30,000 in count.

FT  20 MAY 93 / The mystery of a shrinking dole queue in a sluggish market:
How the official unemployment count has defied contradictory evidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR TWO consecutive months the official count of unemployment in the UK has
fallen. The trouble is, however, no one really believes the figures.
Even the government greeted the news for February and March with caution,
while Department of Employment statisticians confessed to being perplexed by
the sudden change in the trend.
Unless today's figures for April show another fall in the jobless total  -
the consensus forecast is for a small rise - there will be claims that the
figures for February and March were 'fiddled'.
The Unemployment Unit, a research and lobbying organisation, has put forward
the theory that in order to meet performance targets for job placement and
reduce new claims, the Employment Service made an exceptional effort towards
the end of the financial year to shift people off the official count.
The Employment Service has been operating under performance targets for
several years. In the last financial year, in the face of a very weak jobs
market, it was asked to place 1.42m people from the register into jobs -
compared with a target of 1.23m in 1991-92 - and to reject more than 500,000
applications for benefit - about 10 per cent of the total.
Commenting on the performance Mr Peter Warburton, economist at the Robert
Fleming merchant bank, said: 'It appears that the Department of Employment
found itself well short of its targets at the end of December and was forced
to make a special effort in the final quarter to catch up.'
Potential entrants to the register faced a stiffer test and existing
claimants were given priority in job placement over other job-seekers.
The Department of Employment says it has found no evidence of a sudden
switch of activity at Jobcentres. But changes to the claimant count in the
past decade have made it much easier to shift people off the unemployment
register.
The Labour party has pointed out a big increase in the numbers on sickness
and invalidity benefit since the mid 1980s. In a Commons written answer this
month the government said that while unemployment fell a seasonally adjusted
51,500 in February and March, those on sickness benefit increased by 13,000,
and on invalidity benefit by 26,000.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, has produced letters from
people saying that, although they are not ill, they have been encouraged by
the employment department to sign on for sickness benefit on the grounds
that they will get benefit more quickly.
Mr Dobson said: 'We have also received letters saying that Jobcentres are
reserving large numbers of vacancies for those who are registered
unemployed. This means that groups such as married women who may be
unemployed but aren't counted in the figures are stopped from applying for
jobs.'
Some economists have argued that the falls in unemployment simply reflect a
rise in economic activity - the efficiency of the labour market means that
Instead of lagging behind the recovery, it reacts more swiftly to changes in
the economy.
Few are happy with this view. There is a good deal of evidence to suggest
that, far from falling in February and March, unemployment was still on the
increase. The evidence includes:
No significant change in the stock of unfilled vacancies.
Continued falls in manufacturing employment.
Continued falls in average weekly hours worked, albeit marginal.
Industrial-sector predictions. The Engineering Employers' Federation has
forecast that a further 99,000 jobs will be lost in its sector this year
while the construction industry is forecasting a further 50,000 job losses.
No increase in overtime - overtime hours worked fell in February.
It is highly unusual for unemployment to start falling so early in a
recovery.
Mr Paul Gregg of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said
there could be little doubt that there was 'a bit of reclassification going
on'.
But he added it might also be the case that, while the total amount of
employment was not actually increasing, the employment service had become
more efficient at placing people.
Little can be done to check the validity of the official figures until June,
when the first-quarter labour-force survey - which asks people whether they
have looked for a job at any time in the previous four weeks - is published.
If people have been pushed off the register even though they are still
unemployed, they will show up in the labour-force survey.

FT  20 MAY 93 / 'Going concern' guidelines issued
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS should provide more details in the annual report of whether their
company is a 'going concern' for the next year, under draft guidelines
issued yesterday by a working party of accountants and accounts preparers.
They should disclose any critical assumptions on the future of the company,
including the need for financing arrangements to be in place 'for the
foreseeable future'.
The guidelines from the working group on going concern fleshes out details
of a statement on this area recommended by the Cadbury committee on the
financial aspects of corporate governance. Quoted companies will have to
make a statement of compliance with the code for year-ends after June 30.
The working group suggested that the directors' statement would ideally be
placed in the new operating and financial review section in annual reports
recently recommended by the Accounting Standards Board.
It has invited comments on its draft by July 16 and hopes a revised version
will then be approved by the Cadbury committee and be ready by the end of
September.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Stability in house market reported
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STABILITY HAS returned to the housing market, the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors said yesterday, although it warned that sellers should
ask 'sensible' prices.
The RICS said: 'The market has been taking increasingly confident steps out
of recession for nearly six months, but only now can the RICS conclude that
stability has returned.'
More than 80 per cent of chartered surveyors reported for the second
consecutive month that prices were steady.
But the institution warned that the recovery was not a signal to raise
prices. 'There have been many reports of homeowners reading of recovery and
increasing their prices only to find that their property has become a market
pariah,' it said.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Substitute workforce 'trained'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUBSTITUTE labour force has been trained to take over at Southampton
Container Terminals, Britain's second-largest cargo-handling company, in the
event of a strike over the second cost-cutting plan in a month, according to
the TGWU general union.
The company has told the union that it intends to make a third of its
500-strong workforce redundant and introduce contract casual labour.
The union said up to 80 substitute workers had been trained by Drake
International, the employment training agency, and were being paid Pounds
175 a week on three-month contracts to stand by in the Southampton area.
Mr Denis Harryman, TGWU district secretary in Southampton, said Mr Bruce
Dawes, Southampton Terminal Containers' managing director, had told him the
substitute workforce was an 'insurance' for the company, the main
shareholders of which are Associated British Ports and Peninsular &amp;
Oriental.
The company yesterday refused to comment on the allegations but said in a
statement that overcapacity and the need for cost savings required 'more
flexible working and increased productivity but at significantly lower
cost'.
Two days ago Mr Dawes wrote to Mr Harryman to announce that the company
needed 97 redundancies - 76 from among its terminal operators - because it
seemed likely at best to break even this year and make a loss next year.
Voluntary redundancies would be sought in the first instance.
Mr Dawes said it was 'necessary to take action in order to restore
profitability'. Last year Southampton Container Terminals made a Pounds 5m
after-tax profit on a Pounds 29m turnover.
The company has told the TGWU it means to contract out gatehouse jobs,
container lashing and bus driving to 'suitable suppliers' and possibly other
tasks later, which could involve up to a further 112 redundancies.
Last week all but 32 of the workforce accepted, after legal advice, a
sweeping reform of terms and conditions of employment. This includes a wage
freeze until December 31 1994, more flexible manning arrangements to cover
24 hours a day, a cut in holidays and the end of set meal breaks.
The workers were informed in writing by Mr Dawes on April 14 that they would
be dismissed if they did not agree to terminate their present employment
agreement by April 30 and accept the new terms and conditions.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Modest growth in spending forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMER SPENDING will grow only modestly in the next three years,
reflecting sluggish increases in real incomes and only slim declines in the
savings ratio.
The Society of Business Economists, which represents many leading
private-sector financial analysts, says in its latest assesment of the
economy that a modest upturn has started and will slowly gather momentum
next year.
Mr David Kern, chairman of the society's forecasting group, said: 'We
believe there is little prospect that growth will accelerate to 3 per cent
or more over the next three years and expect GDP to rise to 1.5 per cent in
1993, 2.5 per cent in 1994 and 2.3 per cent in 1995.'
The society believes that the debt overhang, job insecurity and tighter
fiscal policy will limit the recovery.
The forecasts are based on the view that the UK's ability to sustain
recovery depends on a rise in investment and exports. recovery.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Dutch engineering beats British
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR productivity in British engineering companies is 25 per cent to 30
per cent lower than in their Dutch counterparts although proportionately
more initial and continuing training is now carried out in British
companies.
This is the main finding of a study published today by the National
Institute of Economic and Social Research of the differences between
productivity, machinery and skills in British and Dutch engineering
companies.
The report says the main reason for the continuing productivity gap is
widespread provision of full-time vocational education and training in the
Netherlands, which allows companies to carry out subsequent training among
employees to craft and technician standards much faster and more cost
effectively than is possible in Britain.
The study also points to the slower investment in capital equipment such as
advan-ced computer numerically-controlled machinery in British companies
compared with Dutch companies as well as 'lower average levels of workforce
skills and knowledge' to explain the productivity gap.
It says the relatively high standards of students from the age of 13 onwards
at junior and intermediate technical schools in Holland give Dutch employers
a considerable head start over their British counterparts.
The study says British engineering employers are no longer 'complacent' in
the face of international competitive pressures.
The research is based on visits to 12 British and nine Dutch engineering
plants in 1991-92.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Defence cuts 'causing damage'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUTS IN government spending on defence research and development are damaging
Britain's international competitiveness in civil and military aerospace, the
Commons Trade and Industry Committee heard yesterday, Daniel Green writes.
Mr Alan Jones, chief executive of Somerset helicopter-maker Westland, warned
that the Department of Trade and Industry's Pounds 25m programme for civil
aircraft research and development was just 25 per cent of what was needed to
compensate for defence spending cuts.
Funding for improvement of helicopter gearboxes, an essential part of
helicopter upgrades, had been cut from Pounds 3m a year to Pounds 500,000
since the mid-1980s.
In what he described as a 'sad situation', US companies were asking Westland
to do subsidiary work on their own 'well-funded gearbox programmes'. He
said: 'We are not getting as much assistance as our (overseas) competitors.'

FT  20 MAY 93 / Pension break-up sought in divorces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGLISH LAWS should be reformed so that occupational and personal pension
rights can be divided following a divorce, says an industry working party
report.
The Pensions Management Institute and the Law Society have called for
sweeping legal changes to clarify the ownership of pension rights, now
largely ignored in divorce cases. The failure to consider pension assets
leaves many divorced women in poverty in their old age.
The unveiling of the report, which has taken 18 months to complete, comes
hard on the heels of the first decision by an English court to give a
divorced woman a share of her former husband's pension from his
small-company scheme.
Although Scottish law provides for the distribution of pension rights on
divorce, there are no comparable laws in England, Wales or Northern Ireland.
But the courts have increasingly taken the view that a pension is deferred
pay, and the industry has sought to clarify how it should be distributed in
a divorce.
The government has been waiting for the institute's report and the findings
of the Department of Social Security's Goode committee before planning
legislation.
Among the working party's chief recommendations are that the courts should
have power to share out pension benefits and give orders to trustees and
others running pension schemes.
In determining how much pension to allocate to the divorced spouse the
normal measure of value should be the so-called statutory cash equivalent,
which is currently used as the normal basis of individual transfer values
payable when an employee switches from one pension scheme to another.
The working party suggested four options for splitting pension rights when
partners divorce.
First, they could continue undisturbed for the main breadwinner but other
assets of equal value could be given to the spouse.
Second, pension rights could continue undisturbed but a specified portion of
the benefit could be earmarked, and eventually become payable to the former
partner, when the breadwinner retired.
Third, pension rights could be transferred to another scheme just as rights
are transferred when workers change employers.
And, fourth, the rights could be split within the scheme to offer a separate
package of benefits.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Premier League clubs count the cost of their breakaway:
End-of-season concerns where pounds matter as much as points
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN referee Keren Barratt blows his whistle tonight, ending the 1993 Cup
Final replay between Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday, it will mark the end
of a significant season for English soccer.
The 22 clubs which broke away last summer to form the Football Association's
Premier League will now be working out the financial winners or losers from
the split with the 105-year-old English Football League.
Pounds matter as much as points to hard-pressed clubs faced with expensive
ground rebuilding programmes. Financial expertise is as important as soccer
coaching skills - as Mr Terry Venables, Tottenham Hotspur's threatened chief
executive, may yet dis-cover.
Under the the Pounds 304m sponsorship deal with BSkyB each of the 22 clubs
received Pounds 750,000 plus an equal share of separate Pounds 12m
sponsorship deal with Bass, the brewers.
In addition, clubs were paid Pounds 69,335 each time they appeared on
television. The remaining 25 per cent of the BSkyB money was allocated
according each team's final position in the league, with the top club,
Manchester United, receiving about Pounds 850,000 - or 22 times more than
the bottom club, Nottingham Forest.
United, in spite of winning the championship, says it is not that much
better off than it would have been under the old Football League.
The financial attraction remains strong for the so-called English super
clubs, such as Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal,
to promote a new European league of top soccer clubs joined by such clubs as
Real Madrid of Spain, AC Milan of Italy, Benfica of Portugal and Ajax of
Holland.
So which clubs did gain from the new English Premier League? Most fees,
under previous television deals, went to the handful of big clubs attracting
the biggest gates.
Under the new system every club is guaranteed several television
appearances, to the delight of small clubs such as Wimbledon, which ended
half-way down the league and in the previous 1991-92 season had a Pounds 4m
turnover.
Mr Reg Davis, commercial director of Wimbledon, said: 'Last season we didn't
have any live TV appearances - this year we were featured three times.' He
calculates that the club has emerged about Pounds 1m to Pounds 2m richer. It
plans to pass this to fans by freezing season ticket prices next year.
'In the past we have had to sell a player a year to survive. This year we
don't - we might even buy one,' Mr Davis said.
For Manchester United, a quoted company which had a Pounds 17m turnover last
year, the rise in income - even with its championship win - has been less
impressive.
Mr Robin Launders, finance director, said the club was 'relatively worse
off' in television terms.
Its games appeared fewer times on terrestrial television, which had an
indirect effect on shirt sponsorship.
'The Premier League has had a levelling effect. We are better off from the
league, but relatively speaking other clubs are even better off,' said Mr
Launders.
The place where the sums and the match points have become crucial, however,
is on the cusp between the Premier League and the new Barclay's First
Division, as the former second division is now known.
In spite of pessimistic predictions that the appearance of the Premier
League would lead to the decline of the other 70 football clubs, the three
divisions of the Barclay's league seem relatively unscathed.
According to Mr Ian Cotton, Football League spokesman, the three divisions
have seen their seventh successive rise in attendances this year. Total
attendance was 10.9m, 800,000 more than the Premier League.
Mr Cotton said ITV's decision to feature more Football League First Division
games had helped shirt sponsorship for all the clubs.
ITV's Pounds 5.25m deal, however, does little to close the gap between
Premier League and First Division clubs, which, following the Taylor report
in the wake of the Hillsborough disaster, are required to convert to
all-seater stadiums by August 1994.
According to the Football League the report has al-ready prompted Pounds
73.9m worth of development work at First Division clubs, with another Pounds
215m planned.
Mr Desmond McBain, club secretary of Bolton, just promoted into the First
Division, said: 'Every club has got to fight to get into the Premier League
now - it's a question of self preservation.'
Although gate attendances rose by almost 50 per cent last year, the club
still has little idea where finance for rebuilding will come from.
Over the next two years the league will be reduced from 22 to 20 clubs. Mr
Rick Parry, the Premier League's chief executive, denies that he will bow to
pressure from the big clubs to make it even smaller and more exclusive. He
insists that 'you cannot have a league with only five clubs'.
But the pressure to make the league more exclusive seems likely to fuel the
competition even further.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEVEL of violence in satellite television films was attacked yesterday
by the Broadcasting Standards Council, the government television watchdog,
Gary Mead writes.
Lord Rees-Mogg, the council's chairman, said satellite channels such as
BSkyB - in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant
stake - are showing too many violent films.
Six hundred viewers were asked to register the number of occasions when they
saw what they considered to be 'unjustifiable' levels of sex, violence and
bad language, before and after 9pm. Six per cent to 7 per cent of the sample
thought that the level was 'unjustifiable' on satellite TV after 9pm
compared with 2 per cent for BBC and ITV.
Mr David Elstein, BSkyB's head of programming, said: 'The viewers sampled
were clearly unrepresentative, with some findings based on fewer than 50
responses.'

FT  20 MAY 93 / Redundancies at Swan Hunter imminent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDUNDANCIES AT Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder, are likely to be
announced tomorrow, receiver Price Waterhouse has indicated.
In a day of confusion about how soon some of the 2,200 employees may lose
their jobs, Mr Gordon Horsfield, one of the Price Waterhouse team, said
yesterday that there might be redundancies at the end of this week. He would
not speculate on how many.
Price Waterhouse, reacting to an angry union response, later confirmed that
no one would leave the company tomorrow. However, redundancies might be
announced.
Union leaders will meet the receivers at Swan's Wallsend headquarters
tomorrow morning to discuss job losses.
The unions say jobs may go next Friday, the last date for which the Ministry
of Defence has so far given consent for outfitting work to continue on three
Type 23 frigates, the company's main current workload.
Completing the frigates is Swans' best chance of retaining a core workforce,
clinching new orders and finding a buyer to continue shipbuilding.
At a meeting in Carlisle on Saturday shop stewards from all UK shipbuilders
will vote on a motion from Mr Jim McFall, chairman of the shipyard
negotiating committee of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering
Unions, which urges any shipyard to which the frigates might be moved to
refuse to work on them.
The motion warns that any attempt to remove the frigates from Tyneside will
be resisted by Swan Hunter workers.
Swans went into receivership a week ago after failing to win a helicopter
carrier order from the MoD. Mr Horsfield said that between 10 and 20
inquiries about buying the company had since been received 'from companies
of substance', as well as some 'from people sitting at home with not a lot
to do'.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, minister for defence procurement, told the Commons last
night that the successful tender for the Royal Navy's new helicopter carrier
was 'around' the fair and proper price estimated by the ministry of defence.
He ridiculed suggestions by Labour MPs that a 'conspiracy' had resulted in
the contract being awarded to the consortium of Cumbrian-based VSEL and the
Kvaerner Govan merchant ship yard in Glasgow instead of to Swan Hunter.
Mr Aitken said the ministry was surprised by the 'extraordinary gap' - more
than Pounds 50m - between the two bids and insisted that it could not be
accounted for by changes to the original specification.
He promised that the full details of the two bids would be provided, on the
basis of commercial confidentiality, for the inquiry to be conducted by the
National Audit Office.
Asked if Swan Hunter would be allowed to complete the three frigates still
under construction, he said it was a matter for 'ongoing discussions'
between with the receiver.
Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, acknowledged that the government
had no alternative but to award the contract to VSEL, but said that
mysteries surrounding the bidding process left several questions to be
answered.
A Labour motion citing the government's attitude to Swan Hunter as evidence
of its 'callous and cavalier' treatment of workers in defence industries was
defeated by 41 votes (304-263).
Cuts in government spending on defence research and development are damaging
Britain's international competitiveness in both civil and military
aerospace, the Commons Trade and Industry Committee heard yesterday.
Mr Alan Jones, chief executive of Somerset helicopter-maker Westland, warned
that the Department of Trade and Industry's Pounds 25m programme for civil
aircraft research and development was 25 per cent of what was needed to
compensate for spending cuts.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Strikebreakers 'on standby' as dock row looms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUBSTITUTE labour force has been trained to take over at Southampton
Container Terminals, Britain's second-largest cargo-handling company, in the
event of a strike over the second cost-cutting plan in a month, according to
the TGWU general union.
The company has told the union that it intends to make a third of its
500-strong workforce redundant and introduce contract casual labour.
The union said that up to 80 substitute workers had been trained by Drake
International, the employment training agency, and were being paid Pounds
175 a week on three-month contracts to remain on standby in the Southampton
area.
Mr Denis Harryman, TGWU district secretary in Southampton, said Mr Bruce
Dawes, Southampton Terminal Containers' managing director, had told him the
substitute workforce was an 'insurance' for the company, the main
shareholders of which are Associated British Ports and Peninsular &amp;
Oriental.
The company yesterday refused to comment on the allegations but said in a
statement that overcapacity and the need for cost savings required 'more
flexible working and increased productivity but at significantly lower
cost'.
Two days ago Mr Dawes wrote to Mr Harryman to announce that the company
needed 97 redundancies - 76 from among its terminal operators - because it
seemed likely at best to break even this year and make a loss next year.
Voluntary redundancies would be sought in the first instance.
Mr Dawes said it was 'necessary to take action in order to restore
profitability'.
Last year Southampton Container Terminals made a Pounds 5m after-tax profit
on a Pounds 29m turnover.
The company has told the TGWU it means to contract out gatehouse jobs,
container lashing and bus driving to 'suitable suppliers' and possibly other
tasks later, which could involve up to a further 112 redundancies.
The contracts of employment of those concerned will be terminated when their
functions have been contracted out, says Mr Dawes.
Last week all but 32 of the workforce accepted, after legal advice, a
sweeping reform of terms and conditions of employment. This includes a wage
freeze until December 31 next year, more flexible staffing arrangements to
cover 24 hours a day, a cut in holidays and the end of set meal breaks.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Ford losses force cuts in R&amp;D restructuring plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD's continuing losses in Europe have forced the US-based vehicle maker to
scale back its ambitious plan for restructuring its European research and
development operations.
It is reducing the number of jobs to be transferred from the UK to Germany
and is to keep open its Aveley engineering site in Essex, which had been
earmarked for closure.
Ford announced a year ago that it planned to consolidate its UK and German
design and production engineering operations at two sites - Dunton, Essex,
and Merkenich, near Cologne.
The company said yesterday, however, that it had reviewed the plan 'to
ensure that every element of proposed expenditure is absolutely justified in
the light of our present business situation'.
Ford's European automotive operations, including Jaguar, made a record loss
last year of Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 840m) compared with a loss of Dollars
1.079bn in 1991.
The European operations are being drastically restructured, with about
10,000 job losses in Ford of Europe (excluding Jaguar) announced last year.
In spite of earlier optimism about returning to break-even this year Ford
this week admitted that 'as economic conditions have developed, it is
increasingly unlikely that the company's European operations will return to
profitability in 1993'.
Aveley will keep its pilot plant and manufacturing and process-engineering
workshop facilities.
The 'likely benefits' of consolidating the operation at Dunton were
'outweighed by the substantial costs involved', the company said.
Under the revised plan for reorganising research and development the number
of jobs to be transferred from the UK to Germany has been reduced to 226
from 309 a year ago. The jobs are in chassis engineering, body engineering
and transmission operations.
The number of jobs being moved from Germany to the UK, in instrument panel
engineering, has been cut to 22 from 26.
Ford said yesterday that 776 jobs would now be moved to the Dunton technical
centre. Of these 346 would come from Aveley, 172 from Dagenham and 258 from
Basildon. About 400 jobs will remain at Aveley.
Ford said the scaling back of the plan had not compromised its aim of
locating its design and manufacturing engineering staffs at only two
locations in the UK and Germany.
The moves were aimed at improving the efficiency of the operations through
increasing use of simultaneous engineering - involving both design and
manufacturing engineers in project teams.
The company will remain at a disadvantage against its rivals in Europe by
having these functions divided.

FT  20 MAY 93 / 'Dirty matters' denial by Nissan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR executive of Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, yesterday denied that
his company was behind the alleged tax fraud involving Nissan UK, the former
car importer.
Mr Masayuki Sakagami, managing director of Nissan Motor Corporation
Carriers, the Japanese company's freight subsidiary, was giving evidence at
the Old Bailey trial of Mr Michael Hunt, the Nissan UK director who denies
conspiring to cheat the Inland Revenue of Pounds 97m in corporation tax.
Mr Sakagami denied knowing of the role in the alleged fraud of Mr Friedrich
Pannosch, an Austrian rail consultant accused of being party to it by
opening a Swiss account into which about Dollars 200m in charges allegedly
diverted from Nissan UK were paid.
When Mr Sakagami and two other senior Nissan executives met Mr Pannosch in
Vienna for a weekend in early 1990 their purpose was simply to be taken for
a sightseeing tour - not to 'check out' Mr Pannosch because they knew he had
opened the account, he told Mr Michael Sherrard QC, for Mr Hunt.
He denied evidence given earlier in the trial by Mr Pannosch that the Nissan
executives' trip had not been a cultural tour of the city and that they had
spent 20 hours a day pumping Mr Pannosch with endless questions about his
business.
Mr Sakagami said that throughout the weekend the Nissan executives had only
asked questions about Austrian history and painting.
Mr Sakagami said that he was shocked when he eventually learnt of the role
played in the alleged fraud by Mr Pannosch. 'We have absolutely nothing to
do with dirty matters,' he said.
The trial continues today.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Guildford Four police acquittal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE FORMER Surrey detectives accused of manufacturing notes of interviews
with one of the Guildford Four were yesterday acquitted of conspiracy to
pervert the course of justice, Robert Rice writes.
Ex-Detective Chief Inspector Thomas Style, 59, ex-Detective Sergeant John
Donaldson, 57, and former Detective Constable Vernon Attwell, 52, were
accused of lying on oath that notes of interviews with Patrick Armstrong
were contemporaneous when they had been compiled later from rough notes.
In the interviews Mr Armstrong confessed to planting a bomb in the Horse and
Groom pub, Guildford in October 1974.
Mr Armstrong, Mr Gerard Conlon, Mr Paul Hill and Ms Carole Richardson
received life sentences in 1975 for the bombings of the Horse and Groom and
Seven Stars pubs in Guildford. Their convictions were quashed by the Appeal
Court in October 1989 after it had heard how investigating police officers
had altered notes of interviews, suppressed significant material and given
false evidence.

ABOUT a third of British Gas's customers would be likely to switch to a

The poll found 62 per cent support for freedom of choice, and just over a

FT  20 MAY 93 / Fresh twist in suncare row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HIGH street battle over suncare products took a fresh turn yesterday
when Boots, Britain's largest chemists chain, withdrew its application for
an interim injunction against Superdrug, its smaller discount rival, Guy de
Jonquieres writes.
Boots sought the injunction last month to prevent Superdrug selling a range
of private-label products called Solait, which Boots claimed could be
confused with its own Soltan brand.
Boots said it had withdrawn the application because it did not have time to
respond to evidence introduced by Superdrug shortly before yesterday's court
hearing.
Superdrug claimed the application had been dropped because its evidence
refuted market research submitted to the court by Boots. Superdrug also said
Boots' lawyers had sought to have the research withdrawn.
The two companies agreed that Boots would pay its own legal costs to date,
regardless of the outcome of a full trial.
Boots said it still intended to proceed to a full trial.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Satellite TV film violence criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEVEL of violence on satellite television films was attacked yesterday
by the Broadcasting Standards Council, the government watchdog which
monitors sex and violence on television.
Lord Rees-Mogg, the council's chairman, said satellite channels such as
BSkyB - in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant
stake - are showing too many violent films.
The report was based on a survey of the viewing habits and responses of 600
people during 1991 and 1992. They were asked to register the number of
occasions when they saw what they considered to be 'unjustifiable' levels of
sex, violence and bad language, both before and after 9pm.
The definition of 'unjustifiable' was left to the discretion of the viewers,
who were asked to register on a scale of 0-5 the degree of offence it caused
them.
According to the survey less than 1 per cent of viewing is described as
having any 'significant' levels of 'unjustifiable' sex, violence or bad
language. That doubled to 2 per cent on the BBC and ITV after 9pm, when
programming with more adult content is permissible.
However, that post-9pm 'unjustifiable' figure grew to 6 per cent to 7 per
cent in the case of satellite television.
Dramas, drama series and films accounted for 70 per cent of all reported
excesses in the post 9pm period. Viewers favoured warnings of strong
language after 9pm.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Pacific neighbours try to patch quarrels: 'Down-under'
diplomacy as Keating visits New Zealand for talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SYDNEY Morning Herald's main story yesterday, headlined 'PM sends Kiwis
Dollars 500m welfare bill' was accompanied by a cartoon showing a New
Zealander lying on an Australian beach and saying he had emigrated because
job opportunities were better there.
Almost all Australia's daily newspapers carried front-page reports of a
briefing by one of Mr Paul Keating's senior aides on the agenda for the
prime minister's four-day visit to New Zealand, which starts in Wellington
today.
The media coverage reflects Australian prejudices about New Zealanders, who
are widely believed to have taken an unfair advantage of reciprocal
immigration and social security arrangements between the two countries.
However, the story was regarded with puzzlement in Wellington, where Mr
Keating's visit is regarded as an opportunity to ease recent strains in the
bilateral relationship.
In particular, Mr Keating was thought to want to soothe resentment caused by
Labor's occasionally vitriolic criticism of New Zealand's free market
economic policies in the run-up to the Australian federal election in March.
Ironically, the growing Australian resentment about New Zealand immigrants
has been accompanied by rapid progress towards economic integration
following the 1983 Closer Economic Relations (CER) agreement. Studies show
that both CER and the parallel Trans Tasman Travel agreement, which
guarantees free movement of Australian and New Zealand citizens, have
delivered net benefits to both countries.
Free trade in manufactured goods was established in 1990, and bilateral
trade is growing at 12 per cent a year. However, the greatest benefits have
accrued to New Zealand, which now sends 19 per cent of its exports to
Australia.
As a result, the relationship with Australia has become a high priority for
New Zealand, which virtually ignored its larger neighbour until the 1980s,
in spite of their shared history as former British colonies. Mr Jim Bolger,
the conservative New Zealand prime minister, would also like a successful
round of talks to improve his image in the approach to a difficult election
later this year. However, there are a number of areas in which agreement may
be difficult:
New Zealand wants to see rapid progress on 'second generation' CER issues
such as harmonisation of standards, corporate taxation law, business law and
investment rules. It also wants greater access to markets such as
telecommunications, coastal shipping and insurance.
Some progress has been made, partly as a result of the inclusion of New
Zealand ministers in most of Australia's ministerial councils, which
co-ordinate federal and state government approaches to such issues. But Mr
Bolger will be seeking an indication that harmonisation remains a priority
for Australia, and that the speed of reform will be increased by the
re-elected Labor government.
In particular, New Zealand would like to tie up an agreement on
pre-clearance for airline passengers, which has been held up by Australian
concerns about New Zealand's visa requirements for third countries.
Mr Bolger will try to defuse the welfare row by agreeing to a review of
reciprocal social security arrangements, especially for pensioners, but he
will resist any attempt to weaken the free travel agreement. The Australian
government has been under pressure from its trade union allies to restrict
access for some workers, especially sheep shearers, who are accused of
undercutting established wage rates.
Canberra has been perturbed by New Zealand's support of the North American
Free Trade Agreement, which Australia sees as a potential threat to Japan,
its biggest trading partner.
New Zealand has worked hard behind the scenes to allay Australian fears, but
Mr Keating will be seeking assurances that Wellington remains committed to
the integration of both Australasian economies into the Asia Pacific region.
Mr Bolger, who returned on Tuesday from a trip to Japan, China and South
Korea, said last week that he was 'comfortable' with Wellington's
increasingly close relationship with Asia.
New Zealand's trade is more geographically diversified than Australia's, and
Wellington is less enthusiastic than Canberra about the prospects for
regional trading organisations such as the Australian-inspired Asia Pacific
Economic Co-operation process.
New Zealand's nine-year-old anti-nuclear legislation, which bars visits by
nuclear armed or powered ships, has reduced the effectiveness of the Anzus
defence pact, which links Australia, New Zealand and the US. Mr Bolger would
like to repeal the legislation, but is unable to do so because it is
strongly supported by voters of all parties. As a result, the US has
suspended exercises with the New Zealand armed forces, restricting its
access to intelligence and military equipment.
Canberra has continued bilateral defence links with New Zealand, which
include a joint frigate programme, but Australian ministers have recently
made clear that they will not support a return to three-way exercises until
the nuclear ban is abandoned. Mr Keating may also express concern about the
falling level of New Zealand defence spending, which has been capped for
three years because of budget constraints.
There is one area in which the two leaders will be in complete agreement:
both want to see a rapid conclusion to the Uruguay Round talks on the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Both countries would gain substantially from liberalisation of agricultural
trade, and the talks are likely to conclude with a joint appeal to the US
and the European Community to stop bickering over the details.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Land prices fall in Japan's biggest cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LAND PRICES in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan's two largest cities, continued to
fall in the first quarter this year, putting added pressure on financial
institutions exposed to the property market.
The National Land Agency said the greater Tokyo residential price index fell
an annualised 5 per cent during the period, compared to 8.2 per cent in the
previous quarter, while commercial prices fell 5.9 per cent, against 9.2 per
cent.
Officials at the agency said the slowing of the fall suggested that the
market was close to touching bottom, but most Japanese banks and other
property-related lenders had hoped the downward trend would be reversed in
the first quarter.
The falls are undermining the value of property collateral held by financial
institutions, which fuelled speculative investment in the market during the
late 1980s, when it was predicted that Japanese land prices would never
fall.
Commercial prices in Osaka fell 5.2 per cent during the quarter, while the
residential index fell 4.2 per cent in that city. It was a particularly
popular location for building 'investment apartments', many of which remain
empty.
The 'bubble era's' most famous stock speculator, Mr Mitsuhiro Kotani, was
yesterday given an 18-month suspended jail sentence for what the Tokyo
District Court described as the 'naked manipulation' of stock prices.
Mr Kotani, 56, had pleaded guilty to manipulating the stock price of Fujita
Kanko, a tourism company, but the court also condemned banks and brokers
which assisted his speculator group during its reign over Japanese markets
in the late 1980s.
The group, Koshin, bought shares in companies ranging from Janome, a leading
maker of sewing machines, to Kokusai Kogyo, an aerial survey company, which
it first attempted to greenmail and then took over when the management was
unwilling to buy back the Koshin stake.
Mr Kotani admits that his group earned about Y31bn (Pounds 181m) through
manipulating Fujita Kanko's price, which rose 40 per cent during one week in
April 1990. The money was needed to complete the purchase of Kokusai Kogyo.
While Mr Kotani admitted the charge, he suggested that he did not intend to
deceive other investors into buying the stock, while his lawyers argued that
Fujita itself and Tobishima, a formerly conservative construction company,
had played an important role in the manipulation.
In the late 1980s Mr Kotani, became one of the brightest stars of the
'bubble era'.
His downfall, which came with the collapse of stock prices, has left a range
of politicians and bankers open to criticism.

UNITED NATIONS staff in Cambodia were aghast yesterday when their chief
attempted to ease fears about possible Khmer Rouge artillery attacks during
next week's election by saying that the guerrillas often missed their
targets or used ammunition which failed to explode.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia
(Untac), summoned staff at Untac headquarters in Phnom Penh and told them it
was 'more than likely' that the Khmer Rouge would try to disrupt the
election by mining roads leading to polling stations and harassing voters.
'There may even be some bombardments and rocket attacks aimed at some of the
polling stations,' he said as the official campaign period drew to a close.
'In most cases they will miss the targets but we have to be prepared. . . We
cannot afford too many more sacrifices among our colleagues.'
Many UN officials expressed their dismay at Mr Akashi's remarks. In contrast
to his previously optimistic assessments of the UN's Dollars 2bn (Pounds
1.2bn) peacekeeping mission in Cambodia, he has gone out of his way this
week to paint a gloomy picture of the election, possibly so that the reality
will not seem so bad. Twelve Untac staff have been killed by landmines or
gunmen.
Mr Hun Sen, the prime minister of the Phnom Penh government - which has not
been recognised internationally and is regarded by the UN as one of the four
main Cambodian factions - yesterday sought to reassure his critics by
insisting that his administration would hand over power if it lost the
election.
Asiawatch, the US-based human rights group, yesterday accused the United
Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) of failing to deal
effectively with human rights abuses and said it had thereby left the way
open for further abuses in the future.
'Hundreds of serious abuses have been documented by Untac, but few have been
publicly exposed or redressed,' Asiawatch said in a report. Untac's failure
was serious because its mandate emphasised measures to assure human rights
in view of Cambodia's tragic history, the report said.
Abuses had been committed by all the main factions: the UN had continued to
court the Khmer Rouge after the guerrillas had slaughtered Vietnamese and
Cambodian civilians, and it had failed to dismiss or prosecute government
officials who condoned the murder and intimidation of opponents.
Asiawatch urged Untac to appoint an independent tribunal to ensure that
suspects in Untac investigations were properly tried, and suggested the
government to emerge from next week's election should give priority to
creating an independent judiciary.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Clinton reverses US Angola policy and ditches Savimbi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday accorded full diplomatic recognition to the former Marxist
government of Angola headed by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
Speaking before a meeting with Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa,
President Bill Clinton made it clear he had acted because Mr Jonas Savimbi's
Unita movement had refused to accept the latest peace plans designed to end
the civil war in Angola.
'The Angola government,' Mr Clinton said, 'has by contrast agreed to sign
that peace agreement, has sworn in a democratically elected national
assembly and has offered participation by Unita at all levels of government.
Today we recognise those achievements by recognising the government and
republic of Angola.'
He said he had tried to use the leverage of recognition as a means to end
the civil war. He also wanted to reaffirm 'the high priority that our
administration places on democracy.'
He did not say if he thought an end to the carnage in Angola was now in
sight.
The decision to isolate Unita internationally appears to mark the end of a
long relationship between the US and Mr Savimbi, regarded for much of the
Reagan and Bush administrations as a bulwark against the ambitions of the
former Soviet Union and Cuba in Angola.
US financial and materiel support for Unita ended in 1991, before the peace
agreement which also saw the withdrawal of Soviet aid and Cuban troops.
However Mr Savimbi has remained a popular figure in US right-wing political
circles, frequently escorted around Washington by the likes of Senator Jesse
Helms of North Carolina.
However, his refusal to accept the results of elections last year, narrowly
won by Mr dos Santos and his party, and his resumption of the civil war
angered the Bush administration in its final weeks and has increasingly
frustrated Mr Clinton's government.
The last straws were continuing reports of Unita's territorial gains and
atrocities on the ground in Angola and its rejection last week of the latest
peace proposals put forward by international mediators in Abidjan, capital
of Ivory Coast.
Mr Clinton had also been subject to increasing domestic pressure to
recognise the dos Santos government. This has been most evident from
influential black leaders such as the Rev Jesse Jackson and Congressman
Kweisi Mfume of Maryland and also, if more discreetly, from US oil companies
with interests in Angola.
Some external influence was also brought to bear. Bishop Tutu said he was
'thrilled' by Mr Clinton's action, which would help improve human rights in
Africa.
The emerging Clinton approach to Africa involves the promotion of democracy
and market-oriented reforms, debt relief, an activist approach to 'disasters
in the making', such as Somalia, and attempts to resolve a number of
conflicts such as Zaire, Liberia, Sudan and Togo.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Inside South Africa's atomic laager
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa on Tuesday proposed to ban the manufacture of nuclear and
biological weapons.
This followed an announcement earlier this year by President F W de Klerk
that Pretoria had dismantled six nuclear weapons built between 1974 and
1990.
The proposed law aims to ensure compliance with international treaties and
conventions governing nuclear and biological weapons, including monitoring
dual-use equipment. A United Nations embargo prevents the sale to South
Africa of arms as well as other items including supercomputers, which have
military potential.
Mr Derek Keys, minister of finance, trade and industry, told parliament:
'The object of the bill is further to promote and ensure free trade with the
international community.'
Senior South African officials participated in a recent conference on
nuclear non-proliferation in Africa held in Harare in association with the
University of Zimbabwe. John Simpson, Darryl Howlett and Jeremy Ginifer of
the Programme for Promoting Nuclear Non-Proliferation examine what is known
about South Africa's nuclear programme.
SOUTH African officials told PPNN that their nuclear capability was not
intended for use against Soviet-backed Cuban or African forces as had been
previously suspected. Instead, it is claimed this capability was designed to
secure western intervention, in particular from the US, in the event of an
imminent threat of attack by Soviet-backed forces.
It would then have conducted a nuclear test to demonstrate its possession of
nuclear devices. By signalling that further devices existed, South Africa
thus expected to secure western intervention to halt the conflict and
neutralise Soviet nuclear capabilities.
Pretoria's nuclear doctrine, which might be termed catalytic deterrence, was
never disclosed and has no direct historical parallel in nuclear strategy.
Nuclear weapons states have tended to regard their unilateral readiness to
use nuclear weapons as central to credible deterrence.
South Africa's strategy was driven by its perceived vulnerability to a
Soviet-inspired attack through neighbouring African states, backed by the
threat posed by Soviet nuclear weapon capabilities. It was felt that this
threat could be neutralised only by directly linking South Africa to the
west's nuclear deterrence umbrella.
The nuclear strategy had three stages, PPNN was told. The first was a
deliberate policy of ambiguity. Pretoria would 'neither confirm nor deny'
the possession of nuclear explosive devices. It was thought that this stance
would persuade western states to pressure the Soviet Union into exercising
restraint in the region.
If this policy failed, and a substantial military threat emerged, a second
stage would be implemented. This was the detonation of a nuclear device. It
was assumed that this would lead to frantic western diplomatic activity both
to prevent any nuclear devices actually being used and to constrain the
Soviet Union and its allies from further military action. The South Africans
may thus have hoped to obtain western nuclear security guarantees in return
for their non-use of nuclear weapons and for nuclear disarmament.
If this did not produce the desired results, the third stage would be
initiated by revealing to the west the existence of a stockpile of devices.
The strategy was conceived during the mid-1970s, when South Africa felt
territorially threatened and diplomatically isolated. The first nuclear
device was completed in 1980 but, after problems with the uranium enrichment
plant, only six of a planned stockpile of seven devices had been
manufactured by 1989 when the programme was terminated.
The limited stockpile resulted from the catalytic deterrent strategy. Of the
seven devices, three were for use at the Vastrop test site. The remainder
were intended as back-ups in the event of a test failure and for
demonstrating the existence of a stockpile.
Three shafts, drilled to a depth of 180 to 200 metres, were planned for the
test site, but one shaft had to be abandoned because of geological
difficulties. The other two were completed by 1977 and, although equipped
with some instrumentation, were never used.
The nuclear devices also appear to have been less advanced than previously
assumed. In view of the catalytic strategy, it was decided to develop a
nuclear explosive device, not a deliverable weapon of the type currently
deployed by the nuclear weapon states.
The device chosen - a gun assembly design - was similar in concept to the
'laboratory weapon' dropped by the US on Hiroshima in 1945. It had a yield
of 12-15kt and used uranium 235, which could be mined and enriched within
South Africa.
Light can also be shed on other mysteries surrounding the South African
nuclear programme.
Intense speculation has surrounded the detection of an unusual double flash
in the South Atlantic by a US satellite in 1979, which some considered
evidence of a South African nuclear test. According to Pretoria no test
occurred and no radioactive fallout was recorded in the vicinity. This may
add substance to the claim that the flash was induced by a micro meteorite
hitting the satellite. Claims that South Africa's nuclear deterrent
programme benefited from co-operation with Israel or any other state were
also denied.
South Africa's explanation of its deterrent strategy raises additional
questions which remain unanswered. One is whether this account is a
rationalisation after the event. Only hard evidence that the devices were
not produced in weapon form and that there were no aspirations to advance to
more sophisticated fission can dispel this possibility.
The second is whether the catalytic deterrence strategy would actually have
worked if it had been implemented in the manner described. The end of the
cold war may have eliminated the specific circumstances, although the idea
of using nuclear proliferation as a bargaining tool to exert leverage over
the nuclear weapons states probably persists.
Is this strategy also the rationale underpinning the activities of other
states with ambiguous nuclear programmes, such as Israel, Pakistan, India
and North Korea?

<TEXT>
PHILIPPINE President Fidel Ramos yesterday expressed disappointment over a
US federal jury verdict clearing Westinghouse Electric of bribery. An elated
Mrs Imelda Marcos said the decision vindicated her late husband, AP reports
from Manila.
The jury on Tuesday found that Westinghouse and a New Jersey engineering
company paid no bribes to the then President Ferdinand Marcos to win a
nuclear power contract, an allegation made by the government of President
Corazon Aquino, his successor.
Mr Jess Sison, presidential spokesman, said the Philippines would continue
to pay back a loan from Westinghouse for the Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.5bn)
the plant cost in 1976. Daily interest alone costs Dollars 300,000 and the
principal is the biggest single portion of the country's foreign debt burden
of Dollars 30bn.
Mr Francisco Villa, state prosecutor, said the government would appeal
against the verdict.
The 620MW nuclear plant on the Bataan peninsula, the country's only nuclear
power plant, was completed in 1985 but never started up by the Aquino
administration.
The Marcos family faces more than 80 criminal and civil charges in the
Philippines in connection with alleged corruption, but none of the trials
has been completed.

THE EGYPTIAN authorities have stepped up their battle with Islamic
extremists, arresting more than 800 people in the past 10 days.
According to members of the security forces quoted by Reuter, the latest
arrests are an attempt to smash a hitherto unknown group called the
Vanguards of the New Holy Struggle.
The group is said to have been recruiting members in schools and
universities, and advocates the full application of Islamic law.
President Hosni Mubarak has blamed Iran for sponsoring the wave of extremist
attacks, which have badly damaged the tourism industry, and last month ruled
out any possibility of a dialogue with radical Islamic factions.
Mr Mohammed Abdel-Moneim, the president's spokesman, said at the time: 'The
strategy is steady - to get rid of these people.'
US officials have cast doubts on the extent of external involvement in
Egyptian terrorism, while liberal, secular organisations in Cairo have
warned Mr Mubarak against the dangers of pursuing a confrontational policy
with groups in large part motivated by poor social and economic conditions.

ASIAWATCH, the US-based human rights group, yesterday accused the United
Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) of failing to deal
effectively with human rights abuses and said it had thereby left the way
open for further abuses in the future.
'Hundreds of serious abuses have been documented by Untac, but few have been

Asiawatch urged Untac to appoint an independent tribunal to ensure that

Asiawatch also said Thailand should be pressed to arrest Pol Pot, the
extreme left-wing Khmer Rouge leader, for crimes committed during the
organisation's reign of terror in Cambodia from 1975 to 1978, 'rather than
providing him shelter and protection'.
Pol Pot and his associates are blamed for the deaths of an estimated 1m
Cambodians. He now has a house in eastern Thailand near to the Cambodian
border and has close relations with Thai military officers.
The report recommended that the UN should improve its monitoring of the
border to ensure that timber and gems do not go into Thailand in violation
of sanctions and provide foreign exchange for the Khmer Rouge. Consumers and
traders - including those from Japan, Vietnam and Thailand - should be
punished if they broke the embargoes.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Kotani given suspended sentence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST famed stock speculator of the 'bubble era' in Japan, Mr Mitsuhiro
Kotani, was yesterday given an 18-month suspended jail sentence for what the
Tokyo District Court described as the 'naked manipulation' of stock prices.
Mr Kotani, 56, had pleaded guilty to manipulating the stock price of Fujita
Kanko, a tourism company, but the court also condemned banks and brokers
which assisted Mr Kotani's speculator group during its reign over Japanese
markets in the late 1980s.
The group, Koshin, bought shares in companies ranging from Janome, a leading
making of sewing machines, to Kokusai Kogyo, an aerial survey company, which
it first attempted to greenmail and then took over when the management was
unwilling to buy back the Koshin stake.
Mr Kotani admits that his group earned about Y31bn (Pounds 181m) through
manipulating Fujita Kanko's price, which rose 40 per cent during one week in
April 1990. The money was needed to complete the purchase of Kokusai Kogyo.
While Mr Kotani admitted the charge, he suggested that he did not intend to
deceive other investors into buying the stock, while his lawyers argued that
Fujita itself and Tobishima, a formerly conservative construction company,
had played an important role in the manipulation.
In the late 1980s Mr Kotani, became one of the brightest stars of the
'bubble era'.
His downfall, which came with the collapse of stock prices, has left a range
of politicians and bankers open to criticism. A former environment minister
was charged with tax evasion on profits allegedly made through Kotani stock
tips, while the deputy head of Sumitomo Bank's domestic business division
resigned to take responsibility for the bank's dealings with him.
The court said yesterday that the securities companies which assisted Mr
Kotani in his share raids and price manipulation were 'partly responsible'
for the affair, and the Tokyo market had been 'far from fair and just'. Mr
Kotani still faces a separate charge of extorting Y30bn from Janome, the
sewing machine company.

FT  20 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Uruguay sees regional trend for Americas -
Stephen Fidler interviews the president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FREE trade zone made up of the entire American continent is too ambitious
an objective, and governments in the western hemisphere should concentrate
instead on developing their own regional groupings, according to President
Luis Alberto Lacalle of Uruguay.
'We should approach this step-by-step. I think the integration movement
mustn't go to the top at the beginning, from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. No,
nonsense,' he said in an interview.
Instead, the first stage should be groups of countries getting together, as
Uruguay is doing with its partners in Mercosur - Argentina, Brazil and
Paraguay. Making Mercosur work was 'very difficult, so the idea for this
generation, and perhaps for another one, is to try to make these things
work.'
Mr Lacalle's remarks were in response to a question about the possibility of
Argentina being able to join the North American Free Trade Agreement of
Mexico, Canada and the US. Washington has said that three South American
countries - Chile, Argentina and Venezuela - would be candidates for
accession to Nafta. But Mr Lacalle pointed out: 'Nafta is not a reality yet
 -and that's a big if.'
He said an important part of Bolivia looked to the Atlantic so it made sense
for the land-locked country to join Mercosur. However, Bolivia is prevented
by the Mercosur treaty from joining because it is a member of another trade
organisation, the Andean Pact. Mr Lacalle said: 'We are trying to provide
the possibility. It needs the agreement of the four (member) countries.'
The president conceded that, when Mercosur's common external tariff comes
into effect on January 1 1995, 'perhaps we won't have a perfect common
market' and there would be 'some exceptions to the common external tariff'.
However, for most goods, the common external tariff would be about 20 per
cent and there would be no internal tariffs.

<TEXT>
THE US steel industry warned yesterday that implemention of the proposed BTU
tax on energy in the US would hit producers hard, putting them at a
disadvantage against imports.
Speaking at the general meeting of the American Iron and Steel Institute in
New York, Mr Thomas Usher, president of US Steel Group, said: 'It would
place new costs on US-produced goods that our foreign competitors would not
have to bear.'
He said the industry would face direct annual costs increases of as much as
several hundred million dollars - money urgently needed for modernisation.
The industry had approached Congress with alternatives, he said, which
included a flat fee per ton, which could apply to domestic production as
well as imports, and at a rate equal to the proposed BTU tax.
The industry's hard line on imports and trade was held at the meeting. Last
year, US steel producers petitioned the International Trade Commission over
alleged dumping in the US by foreign producers at unfair prices, and
government subsidies to overseas groups.

FT  20 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Clinton's Dollars 7bn dilemma on China -
Linking human rights to trade could backfire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMOCRATS in the US Congress used to enjoy watching former President George
Bush squirm during his annual veto of legislation which linked US tariff
levels on Chinese imports with the country's human rights behaviour.
Now it is President Bill Clinton's turn to feel the heat. As a candidate he
indicated support for the Democrats in Congress. As president he must worry
that even conditional China trade linkage, under which the administration is
required to certify annually that China has improved its human rights and
arms sales record, would jeopardise up to Dollars 7.5bn (Pounds 4.9bn) in US
exports this year.
This policy of non-discrimination in trade policy, the Most Favoured Nation
treatment, provides to all trading partners the same customs and tariff
arrangements.
The president has until June 3 to notify Congress whether he will renew
China's MFN status. He could at the same time unilaterally impose some
conditions on next year's renewal to head off legislation in Congress to
impose even steeper requirements. Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state,
said China's reportedly coercive family planning programme and its alleged
missile sales to Pakistan could be cited as a necessary improvement.
In the business community, the overwhelming sentiment is that morality is a
luxury the US can rarely indulge in these days of persistently high
unemployment - particularly when the price of linking US tariff rates with
China's human rights record gets higher every year.
The voluntary Levi Strauss withdrawal from China is not seen as the
beginning of a trend. In fact, a new report by the International Business
and Economic Research Corporation, which is funded by business, frets that
removal of MFN or conditionality would provoke Chinese retaliation and risk
up to 171,000 US jobs in 1993.
Hardest hit immediately would be US exports of aircraft, fertiliser, wheat
and telecommunications.
In the report's worst case scenario Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and their
suppliers would suffer the greatest harm. They have 76 per cent of China's
aerospace market. Boeing could lose Dollars 5bn in sales. McDonnell Douglas
has been selected for co-production of a 'trunk aircraft' which calls for
firm orders for 40 aircraft, valued at about Dollars 1bn, and it is
discussing assembly of 105-seater aircraft in Shanghai.
China is the largest market for US fertiliser - exports last year were
Dollars 629m - and it is usually the largest or second largest importer of
US wheat. Billions of dollars will be at stake as China modernises its
telecommunications market, where AT&amp;T is already a leading participant.
Former senator Adlai Stevenson, an Illinois Democrat and son of the
country's late United Nation's ambassador, is one of many in business hoping
conditional MFN can be avoided. As head of a US-Chinese joint venture to
design, build and operate commercial telecommunications systems in China, Mr
Stevenson is all too aware of what is at risk.
The joint venture - the China America Telecommunication Company - has a
contract to build a Dollars 20m prototype. US sanctions ultimately could
cost the group participation in China's Dollars 20bn telecommunications
equipment market.
Yet projects like these which link the Chinese people with the outside world
are important to improvement of human rights, Mr Stevenson argues.
'Political liberalisation is happening already, although it is hard to
quantify, and it will continue to happen as ideas and information cross
borders.'
US investment in China has been limited until recently to production
ventures. But investment has expanded in services, with US accounting,
computer software, consulting, financial insurance and marketing firms
establishing a toehold from which the newcomers are expecting to leap into
the China market.
Since August 1992 the following investments are among the dozens which have
been announced: American International Group, forming a wholly-owned
insurance company in Shanghai; Connor Peripherals to manufacture hard disk
drives; Coopers &amp; Lybrand, a joint venture to provide auditing, accounting,
tax and consulting services; Gallup Group, a joint venture to conduct market
research; General Electric, with Chinese partners and others to build a
communications satellite; Singer, construction of a sewing machine company
with annual production of 400,000 units; and Westinghouse Electronics and
Digital Equipment, an agreement with Shanghai No 1 Iron and Steel Plant to
develop automation techniques.
MFN legislation, introduced by the Senate majority leader George Mitchell,
would differentiate between products produced by private enterprises (now
about half US imports from China) and those made in state ventures, which
would be subject to the same high tariffs as Afghanistan, Cambodia, Cuba,
Laos, Montenegro, North Korea, Serbia and Vietnam.
Under the legislation, China would be required to step up releases of
political prisoners and improve its record on religious persecutions, unfair
trade practices, and exports of missiles and other arms exports to regimes
that have not signed up to multilateral controls.
The Dollars 17bn US trade deficit with China is less of an issue in the MFN
debate this year. Congressman Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House foreign
affairs committee, recently acknowledged that 'fair minded people recognise
that increased imports from China reflect the relocation of production from
other Asian exporters, including Taiwan and Hong Kong'.
Furthermore, China's imports are likely to mushroom to supply a growing
demand for raw materials, capital equipment and technology.
Mr Winston Lord, the assistant US secretary of state, last week apparently
made little headway in urging China to make new commitments on human rights
and weapons proliferation.
The administration is expected to wait as long as possible before the June 3
deadline, in the hope that the pressure will produce Chinese concessions.

FT  20 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Coface hit by strong franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC recession and currency devaluations against the franc have made an
increasing number of French exporters' clients unable to pay their bills,
France's export credit agency, Coface, has warned.
In an interview in Le Figaro yesterday, Mr Alain Paupert the Coface director
responsible for short-term risk cover, said the premiums his agency charge
French exporters for insuring payment of their goods 'will no longer' cover
the bad debt claims on it.
Coface paid out FFr400m (Pounds 48m) in 1992, a year which saw 210,000
European companies go bust, with the bankruptcy rate rising by 50 per cent
over two years. In normal times, bad debt claims on Coface amount to about 1
per cent of the total export business it insures, but this rose to 1.8 per
cent in the second half of last year.
Spain has apparently become the riskiest destination for French exports,
with bad debt claims amounting to 3.8 per cent of Coface-insured business
there. But Mr Paupert said that
French companies pay an average of 0.43 per cent of total export turnover to
get Coface cover, with the range of charges varying between 0.3 and 0.9 per
cent. The agency says it may raise the top level on a case by case basis but
is urging French exporters to redouble the care with which they choose
clients.
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur will brief the Commission in Brussels on
June 3 on France's views about the need to broaden the Uruguay Round
negotiations to take in all issues with all Gatt participants, not just
focus on agricultural trade with the US.
The EC executive does not usually expose itself to direct lobbying from a
single EC leader, and the move underlines the determination of Brussels and
Paris to bring the Gatt issue to a head.

FT  20 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Uruguay sees regional trend for Americas -
Stephen Fidler interviews the president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FREE trade zone made up of the entire American continent is too ambitious
an objective, and governments in the western hemisphere should concentrate
instead on developing their own regional groupings, according to President
Luis Alberto Lacalle of Uruguay.
'We should approach this step-by-step. I think the integration movement
mustn't go to the top at the beginning, from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. No,
nonsense,' he said in an interview.
Instead, the first stage should be groups of countries getting together, as
Uruguay is doing with its partners in Mercosur - Argentina, Brazil and
Paraguay. 'Mercosur is made real by geography. It is like a tree whose trunk
is the River Plate and whose roots are in the Atlantic Ocean.
'That's why Mercosur makes sense and why the accession of Bolivia is
reasonable. We are a mass of countries bound together. It's the same for
Mexico, Canada and the US,' he said.
Making Mercosur work was 'very difficult, so the idea for this generation,
and perhaps for another one, is to try to make these things work.'
Mr Lacalle's remarks were in response to a question about the possibility of
Argentina being able to join the North American Free Trade Agreement of
Mexico, Canada and the US. Washington has said that three South American
countries - Chile, Argentina and Venezuela - would be candidates for
accession to Nafta. But Mr Lacalle pointed out: 'Nafta is not a reality yet
 -and that's a big if.'
He said an important part of Bolivia looked to the Atlantic so it made sense
for the land-locked country to join Mercosur. However, Bolivia is prevented
by the Mercosur treaty from joining because it is a member of another trade
organisation, the Andean Pact. Mr Lacalle said: 'We are trying to provide
the possibility. It needs the agreement of the four (member) countries.'
The president conceded that, when the common external tariff comes into
effect on January 1 1995, 'perhaps we won't have a perfect common market'
and there would be 'some exceptions to the common external tariff'. However,
for most goods, the common external tariff would be about 20 per cent and
there would be no internal tariffs.
He said he hoped Montevideo, the Uruguayan capital, would become the
permanent home for Mercosur's administrative secretariat.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Nikko pays Dollars 1m SEC penalty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US subsidiary of the Japanese brokerage house Nikko Securities agreed
yesterday to pay a Dollars 1m (Pounds 654,000) fine to settle charges
brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission, related to the
concealment of an Dollars 18m foreign exchange trading loss incurred by the
firm in 1991.
Nikko also agreed to conduct a compliance review at its US unit.
The three senior executives involved in the case - former chairman Tsuneo
Iida, former chief financial officer Masanori Ishikawa, and former head of
accounting Susumu Okada - were barred from working in the US securities
industry for various periods. The three men no longer work at the firm.
The settlement, which Nikko and the three executives agreed to accept
without admitting or denying any wrongdoing, concerned an Dollars 18m loss
incurred by a Nikko trader on speculative foreign exchange trading in 1991.
The SEC said that the firm's US management failed to disclose the loss for
several months, hiding it in the company's books and wrongly reporting a
profit for the 1991 fiscal year.
The Dollars 1m penalty is the largest paid by a non-US securities firm and
the fourth biggest fine paid by Japanese securities houses this year. In
February, three firms - Daiwa, Nomura and Yamaichi - paid fines from Dollars
50,000 to Dollars 200,000 for various book-keeping irregularities. Daiwa was
also fined for its part in the 1991 Salomon bond auction scandal.
Nikko refused then to settle with the SEC, claiming the penalties demanded
by the agency were too high. The firm described the settlement yesterday as
'reasonable'.
The SEC said the Nikko fine, being five times larger than any paid by the
other Japanese firms, 'reflects the degree of seriousness the SEC attaches
to the misconduct by Nikko'.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Clinton acts to head off revolt over cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton met his party members in Congress yesterday in an
effort to consolidate support for his economic programme and head off a
brewing revolt among conservative and centrist Democrats looking for more
spending cuts and fewer tax increases.
Mr Clinton has appeared rejuvenated by trips to Ohio, Illinois, New Mexico
and California over the last 10 days to seek support for his economic
package from the public. The latter, however, must wait three and a half
years before they can vote for Mr Clinton again, while members of Congress
have a more immediate opportunity to pass judgment.
The Democratic leadership appears unwilling to jeopardise the president's
economic package by allowing party members to tinker with its components,
but they also want to avoid provoking an all-out rebellion by choking off
dissent too fiercely.
Mr Clinton has so far succeeded in keeping his plan more or less intact,
making some concessions on the proposed energy tax and abandoning his
efforts for an investment tax credit, but preserving the main elements he
sought, such as higher taxes on the rich and cuts in many spending
programmes.
The work of the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee on the tax
measures will be married today with that of 12 other committees on the
plan's spending components into a single reconciliation bill, but some
conservative Democrats want to amend the plan when it is debated by the full
House.
Perhaps 20 Democrats are thought unlikely to vote for any tax bill; it would
only take another 20 opposed specifically to the energy tax, allied to the
Republicans, to break the Democrats' 80-seat majority in the House.
'We need all the factions of the Democratic party to unite,' said Mr Tom
Foley, the Speaker of the House.
If the plan cannot be preserved in the House, it would have little chance of
surviving in the Senate, where the Democrats have a much slimmer and less
disciplined majority.
Leaders of the conservative and centrist Democrats, such as Congressman Dave
McCurdy of Oklahoma and Congressman Tim Penny of Minnesota, are pushing for
a measure to place ceilings on all entitlement spending, which includes
medical and social security programmes.
They argue that this is essential if overall government spending is to be
controlled, since entitlements now make up half the federal budget.
Critics complain, however, that across the board entitlement cuts would hurt
the poor and needy. They also warn that the ceiling could pre-empt any
savings from the reform of the health care system now being prepared by the
White House, since medical entitlement programmes such as Medicare and
Medicaid are the fastest growing elements in the budget.
Mr Clinton said after his meeting with the congressional Democrats that he
was optimistic that his economic plan would pass, and would achieve much of
the deficit reduction the conservatives want.
Mr McCurdy, however, said the president would have to compromise because
there were not at the moment enough votes to pass the bill.
But other Democrats said the conservative rebels were seeking to cover their
flanks with voters in their constituencies and would, in the end, fall in
line.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Brazil awards pay rises to military
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, BRASLIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZILIAN President Itamar Franco and the country's military chiefs issued a
joint communique yesterday, warning that 'democracy cannot be allowed to
commit suicide'.
This arose from a four-hour meeting to discuss dissatisfaction in the
military over pay and conditions, as well as the country's worsening social
problems and a recent surge of regional separatist threats.
The chiefs of the three armed services repeated demands for the military to
be put on the same pay scale as the legislature and the judiciary.
They claim that Brazil's military spending amounts to the equivalent of
Dollars 3 per head, compared to Dollars 27 in Bolivia and Dollars 17 in
Argentina. The air force commander says that his service cannot even afford
fuel.
Worried by increasing talk of agitation among the military, which prompted
the meeting, Mr Franco had little choice but to accede, at least in part, to
their demands. He seems to have promised a 97 per cent wage increase
(Brazil's inflation is about 30 per cent a month) and funds to modernise
equipment. The communique explained: 'Democracy is a delicate plant
requiring careful attention if it is not to wither.'
It also stressed the role of the Brazilian armed forces: 'Ethnic conflicts
in Europe, disputes for control of strategic areas, and the formation of
economic blocs mean that large countries such as Brazil, rich in natural
resources, must make greater efforts to defend their territorial and
political sovereignty.'
Reuter adds from Braslia: A left-wing member of Brazil's cabinet said last
night she had been fired by President Franco. Ms Luiza Erundina,
administration secretary, is a former mayor of Sao Paulo.

FT  20 MAY 93 / White House sends its travel office packing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US Vice-president Al Gore's efforts to 're-invent government' have come
quickly home to roost with the sacking of the entire White House travel
department.
The White House said it had found in the department gross mismanagement,
shoddy accounting, four-day work weeks and serious overbilling of the press
who travel in the president's wake. The FBI, it said, would probably be
called in.
To the evident surprise of Ms Dee Dee Myers, White House press secretary,
the press corps reacted coolly to the sackings, charging her with tarnishing
the reputations of loyal employees. Worse still, they complained, the new
head of the travel department is a cousin - distant, according to Ms Myers -
of President Bill Clinton.
Fighting off charges of creeping nepotism, Ms Myers said the White House
press corps had itself complained of the exorbitant cost of the chartered
aircraft that accompany the president on his travels. 'I know this isn't
your personal money, so it perhaps isn't as troubling to you,' she said.
Some reporters even suggested that instead of firing the travel department,
Mr Gore should make them a model for his review of government performance;
after all, they managed to make money, albeit at the expense of the press
corps.
One reporter asked: 'Are you saying that the White House, which is going to
run a trillion dollar deficit over four years, is firing half a dozen
people. . . who have ended up with a big cash surplus?'

<TEXT>
POLITICAL killings are continuing in Guatemala despite the civilian
government's pledge to end them, Amnesty International said yesterday, AP
reports from London.
Opponents of the government of President Jorge Serrano Elias also have been
tortured and some simply 'disappear,' the London-based human rights group
said in a report. 'The government may have changed, but the violations go
on.'
Mr Serrano, who pledged to protect human rights when he took office in
January 1991, 'has singularly failed to do so,' it said.
Amnesty has documented 'tens of thousands' of human rights violations in
Guatemala during the past 20 years. It said the number of political killings
by government forces has dropped - 'but we have yet to see whether this will
be a lasting improvement.
'The odds are against it. Harassment, intimidation and death threats are on
the increase, violators from the past are still walking free and the
repressive structures are still in place.'
A few human rights violators have been convicted, Amnesty said, and a
presidential commission has been set up to co-ordinate human rights policy.
Victims include street children, human rights workers, journalists,
indigenous peasants, academics and trade unionists, Amnesty said. Some have
been killed by members of the security forces in uniform, others were
murdered by 'death squads' - military personnel in plain clothes so as to
'disguise their guilt'.
Yet others have been killed by civil patrols - civilian groups said to be
volunteers but under military control.
Amnesty said the government has tried to cover its responsibility by
claiming that victims were part of armed opposition groups. 'These
allegations are often made, with little or no evidence, against whole
communities of indigenous peasants, for example, or against human rights
workers.'

FT  20 MAY 93 / Sale of Latin American art disappoints
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LATIN American art has suddenly gone off the boil. After three years of
rapidly increasing prices, the auctions in New York this week were
disappointing. On Tuesday, Sotheby's raised Dollars 4.5m (Pounds 2.9m) from
79 lots but the auction was only 52 per cent sold by value.
There was one significant record, for a colonial painting. It depicts the
Christmas Eve festivities in Mexico City in 1720 and is signed Arellano. It
had been discovered recently in a house in England and more than doubled its
estimate, selling for Dollars 497,500.
A painting depicting cafe society in Bogota, 'Cuatro Mujeres' by the
Colombian artist Fernando Botero, was at the bottom of its estimate,
realising Dollars 717,500.
Sotheby's had more luck with its New York sale of the Alexander S. Honig
collection of African art. It totalled Dollars 646,715 and was 92 per cent
sold. A Fang male reliquary from Gabon fetched Dollars 206,000.
Christie's tribal art sale on the same day fared less well, totalling
Dollars 825,212 but only 57 per cent sold. A Benin rectangular bronze plaque
of about the year 1600 went below estimate for Dollars 112,500.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Attali to sue over plagiarism claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD), said yesterday he would sue for libel over accusations
of plagiarism and inaccuracy in his new book about the early Mitterrand
years.
Mr Attali said yesterday he would sue the weekly magazine, Le Nouvel
Observateur, for alleging that his new 960-page book, Verbatim, recording Mr
Francois Mitterrand's time at the Elysee between 1981 and 1986, had
plagiarised conversations which the president had had with Mr Elie Wiesel,
the Nobel Peace prize-winning American author.
Mr Attali told a radio station that 'at my initiative, the president had
some conversations with Elie Wiesel which were broken off and were never the
subject of a contract with any publisher or of any written work'.
'The two men are no longer under any obligation to each other. The president
authorised me to use what he had said in my book, and Elie Wiesel told me he
intended to do the same in his own memoirs,' Mr Attali, who was President
Mitterrand's closest aide during the 1980s, said yesterday.
Le Nouvel Observateur said last night it had not yet received any legal writ
from Mr Attali or his lawyer. Mrs Odile Jacob, a leading French publisher,
had intended to publish the conversations as a book later this year. Mr
Attali said the president had proof-read Verbatim line by line.
Mr Attali has been under fire recently over the amount spent on fitting out
the EBRD headquarters in London. The international governors' board of the
EBRD has ordered an audit into the spending.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Russia offers troops for Bosnia's borders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA has given a pledge to the international mediators on the Yugoslav
crisis that it will provide troops to monitor Bosnia's borders, officials
close to the peace conference said in Geneva yesterday.
The officials said the undertaking was given over the telephone by Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, in Rome to meet European foreign and
defence ministers attending a meeting of the Western European Union.
The number of troops to be provided by Russia has not been specified but is
understood to be relatively small. The mediators, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald
Stoltenberg, were due to fly from Naples to Ukraine and Belarus yesterday to
ask for similar pledges from these two countries.
Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg, who want to start implementing their peace
plan for Bosnia, in spite of its rejection by the Bosnian Serbs, are
pressing members of the UN Security Council to commit troops for this
purpose.
Both Mr Kozyrev and Lord Owen said Tuesday's truce agreement between the
warring Bosnian Moslems and Croats, formerly allies in the struggle against
Serb domination, was a first sign that the peace plan could start to be
implemented at least partially. The US, however, has made it clear that it
does not consider it realistic to implement the plan as long as it has not
been accepted by all parties.
The continuing disagreement between the major powers on what action to take
following the rejection of the Vance-Owen plan by the Bosnian Serbs led to
Washington's refusal to attend a special Security Council meeting at foreign
minister level, which Mr Kozyrev proposed for Friday to discuss Bosnian
policy.
However, both Mr Kozyrev and Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state,
have played down reports of a serious rift between their two countries or
between the US and its European allies. Mr Kozyrev, as well as Mr Douglas
Hurd, British foreign secretary, and their French opposite number, Mr Alain
Juppe, are due to meet Mr Christopher in Washington at the end of this week.
Mr Christopher said yesterday he was sure he would find some common ground
on Bosnia in his talks with the three foreign ministers.
Bosnian Serbs voted by 96 per cent to reject the Vance-Owen peace plan for
Bosnia in a referendum last weekend.
After the result, Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, said his people
would never give up their self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb republic, though they
would be ready to accept a confederation with separate Croat and Moslem
states within Bosnia-Hercegovina.
A declaration adopted by the Bosnian Serbs' assembly last night said that
the Bosnian Serb armed forces had been ordered to halt all military
operations, in keeping with ceasefire agreements signed with the other
parties in the conflict.
However, given the breakdown of innumerable ceasefire agreements since the
beginning of the conflict more than a year ago, it was not immediately
evident what value should be attached to the latest declaration, adopted
shortly after the publication of the referendum results.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Head of Siemens in Italy joins list in scandal

MR Giorgio Scanavaca, chairman and chief executive of the Italian subsidiary
of Germany's electronics giant Siemens, was arrested by Milan magistrates
yesterday on corruption charges.
The arrest is understood to be in connection with magistrates' broadening
inquiry into the payment of bribes to obtain telecommunications contracts.
It casts a further shadow over the activities of foreign multinationals in
Italy's widening political corruption scandal. The Italian subsidiary of
Siemens now joins that of GEC Marconi and Sweden's Ericsson which last week
became involved in the same investigation. The chief executives of these two
subsidiaries were arrested on May 12 on similar charges.
It is the first time in Italy's 15-month-old corruption scandal, concerning
the illicit funding of political parties in return for contracts, that so
many foreign companies have been linked in a single line of inquiry. The big
contracts in the telecommunications sector have been one of the main areas
where foreign companies have bid for business in Italy in recent years.
It is almost a year since ABB, the Swiss-Swedish engineering and electronics
group, first appeared in the investigations, then still largely limited to
Milan. The group was alleged to have paid about L16bn (Pounds 6.8m) in
kickbacks to obtain orders for the city's underground railway.
The foreign trail went relatively cold thereafter, bar a further
embarrassment for ABB, whose chief executive in Italy, Mr Umberto Di Capua,
was arrested and briefly jailed on allegations believed to be linked to the
metro orders. Mr Di Capua, who only joined the company after the completion
of the new line, was released soon after from Milan's San Vittore prison.
However, in the past week the foreigners have been making a comeback.
Siemens is not a complete stranger to the corruption scandal. In May 1992
investigations into alleged corruption in a local hospital in Pavia, south
of Milan, triggered allegations that the company had handed over about L50m
in bribes to win a contract.
The impact on the standing of foreign companies in Italy is still being
digested and public reaction has been limited so far. Officials at Ericsson
were unavailable for comment yesterday, while a Siemens official had 'no
comment' to make on the arrest of Mr Scanavaca. So far, only ABB appears to
have taken its alleged involvement on board. Well before the inauguration of
Fiat's new 'ethical code of business practice' last week, the company had
moved to tighten up its procedures.

<TEXT>
MR EDOUARD Balladur, the French prime minister, has suddenly become the most
favoured candidate to succeed President Francois Mitterrand if an election
were held now, the second opinion poll in a week showed on yesterday, Reuter
reports from Paris.
The polls are potentially worrying for Gaullist leader Jacques Chirac, the
right's long-standing frontrunner, although Mr Balladur has said he has no
intention of running against his longtime mentor.
A poll by IFOP for the news magazine L'Express said Mr Balladur would score
37.5 per cent if he stood as Gaullist candidate in the first round of a
presidential election pitting him against six other likely contenders.
Runner-up was Socialist Michel Rocard with 23.5 per cent.
Mr Balladur would beat Mr Rocard 62.5 per cent to 37.5 per cent in a run-off
second round, the poll showed.
Mr Chirac is the official presidential candidate of the Rally for the
Republic (RPR) party in 1995 when Mr Mitterrand's term ends. Mr Balladur is
an RPR member.
The Express poll showed Mr Chirac would score less than Mr Balladur if he
stood as Gaullist candidate, though he too would beat Mr Rocard by 57.5 per
cent to 42.5 per cent in a run-off.
Mr Chirac picked Mr Balladur, his finance minister from 1986-88, for the
premiership, saying he did not want to serve under Mr Mitterrand again.
L'Express said his calculation was that his protege's popularity honeymoon
would inevitably end by 1995 because of difficult international economic
conditions. By staying in the background, Mr Chirac felt he could keep
control over Mr Balladur and the government's action while maintaining his
popularity.

United Nations human rights investigator, Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki, said
yesterday that the Vance-Owen plan to partition Bosnia had accelerated
ethnic cleansing, Reuter reports from Geneva.
The former Polish prime minister said the west's failure to halt human
rights violations by Bosnian Serbs had created a 'precedent of impunity'
that had encouraged Bosnian Croats to commit similar crimes. He criticised
'the lack of an international response' to counter the policy of ethnic
cleansing.

FRENCH police will have a freer hand to make spot security checks under a
draft law which the cabinet of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur approved
yesterday for submission to parliament.
The measure will relieve police of their current need to prove that an
individual was behaving suspiciously before checking his identity card, and
forms part of the centre-right government's electoral pledge to improve law
and order in French cities.
Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the government spokesman, denied this constituted any
threat to civil liberties which, he said, in reality came from 'insecurity
on the streets'. President Francois Mitterrand who, under the bizarre
cohabitation system presides over the formal cabinet meetings of his
political opponents, was said to have acquiesced because the draft law
provides for possible judicial review of such street searches.
Nonetheless, civil rights groups have complained that young people and
immigrants will inevitably be the target of freer police checks.
Last week the National Assembly endorsed a move - which had started in the
Senate when the Socialists were still in power - to make the offer of French
nationality to immigrants less generous. The new nationality law removes the
automatic right of children born in France of immigrant parents to acquire a
French passport.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Japanese puts EC steel plan to the sword: Mr Hayao Nakamura,
the chief of Ilva, talks to Haig Simonian
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Hayao Nakamura, the former Nippon Steel executive now managing Italy's
loss-making Ilva state steel group, yesterday questioned the authority of
the European Commission to dictate future capacity cuts.
'If competition policy means fair trade, that's fine. But if by competition
they mean acting as judges, then that's not acceptable,' he said. 'We have
to establish what are the rules of the game.'
Mr Nakamura called for a 'gentleman's agreement' between European steel
producers to combat the industry's crisis by raising prices and agreeing
production cuts, in line with Japanese practice, rather than have the
Commission impose plant closures.
'Everyone knows there's overcapacity of airline seats across the Atlantic
and Lufthansa is losing more money than any other airline. But no one has
called on the Germans to scrap half their jumbo jets. It's the same thing
with steel,' he argued.
Mr Nakamura, in his first newspaper interview since taking over at Ilva, was
reacting to a letter earlier this week from Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC
competition commissioner, to Mr Paolo Savona, the Italian industry minister,
outlining problems with Ilva's latest restructuring plan.
The plan, presented to the Commission last month, involves the creation of a
new Italian state steel producer, based on Ilva's big Taranto integrated
steelworks, and the transfer of other plant and about L2,500bn (Pounds
1.1bn) in debt to Iri, the state holding company which controls Ilva.
In his letter to Mr Savona, Mr Van Miert argued that the Ilva plan involves
substantial state aid and might have to be accompanied by up to 3m tonnes of
capacity cuts if it were to go along with the EC steel plan.
Mr Nakamura questions both the Commission's interpretation of state aid and
its right to intervene.
'Iri is no longer a state entity but a joint stock company. If Van Miert
says it's aid, we're starting off at odds and there is no point in carrying
on,' said Mr Nakamura.
The comments illustrate the Italians' belief that the Commission's attitude
towards Ilva is one-sided and based on pressure from leading north European
steel producers, principally the Germans.
'I want to be a good partner to other European steelmakers. But they are our
colleagues, not our controllers,' he said.
Mr Nakamura, who took over the top job at Ilva in January, claimed it could
not be accused of overcapacity or of dumping. Ilva exported only 16 per cent
of its output and exports were widely diffused rather than concentrated in
just a handful of markets, he argued.
He implied that the Commission's approach reflected the desire of some big
north European steelmakers to eliminate capacity from southern competitors
to gain market share. 'They want to send advisers into our plant to
supervise capacity but I won't let them in,' he said.
Ilva, which made a net loss of more than L2,300bn last year, has only 43 per
cent of the Italian steel market, which is Europe's second biggest.
'We could sell 100 per cent of our production in Italy, so why should we cut
output? For the sake of the Italian public, or for the sake of the German
public? What harm do we do to other producers?'
Mr Nakamura said that Ilva would be prepared to make production cuts to its
current output of about 8m tonnes, but only in return for aid from the
government.
As the Italian government has refused to provide funds, large cuts were out
of the question, he implied.
He said that the company, which he forecast would make a net loss of about
L1,700bn this year, would close the remaining steel facilities at its
Bagnoli plant in Naples independently of any Community agreement.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Kohl demands tough public spending cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday demanded harsh cuts in public spending as
the Bundesbank warned that his government's policies were partly to blame
for an unexpected surge in money supply growth last month.
Mr Kohl told a cabinet meeting that every department had to make economies.
They had to be found and negotiated within a few weeks, in time for
inclusion in the 1994 draft budget, to be finalised on July 13.
His warning coincided with the release of central bank figures showing
growth in the M3 measure of money supply had shot though the bank's upper
target level of 6.5 per cent during April, despite a significant slowdown in
bank lending.
M3, regarded as a key indicator of future inflation, expanded at an
annualised adjusted rate of 7.3 per cent, after trailing well below the
lower target level of 4.5 per cent during the previous three months.
In a pointed commentary on the figures, the Bundesbank said a large
proportion of its DM13bn (Pounds 5.2bn) profits for 1992 - credited to Bonn
during the month - had already gone into circulation. 'As a result public
sector cash transactions have given monetary developments a renewed push'.
The provisional figures, released during a meeting of the Bundesbank's
policy-making council which elected to leave key discount and lombard
interest rates unchanged, underline the government's difficulties in meeting
Bundesbank demands for spending restraint.
Recession is biting into state revenues and forcing up welfare and
unemployment payments. The need for renewed efforts to prune public sector
spending stems from a forecast shortfall in tax revenues of DM25.8bn next
year and a total of more than DM100bn for the period up to 1996.
One encouraging sign in the figures was a marked deceleration in the rate of
bank credit growth, a major influence on M3. Lending to enterprises and
individuals in April rose DM13.3bn after an increase of DM30bn in March.
Credit expansion in the six months to the end of April had grown at an
annualised rate of just over 8 per cent compared with almost 9 per cent in
the period to the end of March.
Meanwhile, monetary capital formation, the transfer of funds into
longer-term deposits and instruments not included in M3, had weakened and
rose only DM2.9bn after a DM13bn increase in March.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Rasmussen is quick to reward voters: The Danish government's
rapid attempt to demonstrate benefit of EC membership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VIOLENT riots which erupted in Copenhagen after Tuesday's vote in favour
of the Maastricht treaty came as a profound shock to the government, which
had hoped the result would allow political life to return to its normal
calm.
The shock was all the greater because such explosions are rare in Denmark,
where the political culture is based on consensus and the distance between
extremes is small. Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, prime minister and leader of the
Social Democratic party, was yesterday at pains to emphasise that the
rioters represented a tiny minority.
Nevertheless, the riots reflect a society which has experienced an unusually
divisive debate over the past 18 months, with the electorate being cajoled
into reversing its June rejection of the treaty.
This was acknowledged yesterday by Mr Rasmussen, who moved quickly to
deliver tangible benefits to the people in the form of an economic policy
programme for growth and employment which was presented as having been made
possible by the Yes vote.
Throughout the referendum campaign Mr Rasmussen recognised that a gap had
grown up between politicians and electorate and said that Community
membership had to be seen to deliver benefits to people in their daily
lives.
He described the economic measures as 'an offensive against unemployment',
currently running at 12 per cent. The government predicted they would lower
the level to about 11 per cent next year. 'We are going to break the curve
of rising unemployment,' he said.
The core of the programme is a reform of the income tax system, which will
reduce marginal rates from next year to a band of 38-58 per cent, compared
with 52-68 per cent at present. The reductions will be financed by 'green'
taxes on petrol, electricity, heat and water consumption.
The boost from tax cuts next year will be equal to about 0.5 per cent of
gross domestic product, or about DKr5bn (Pounds 526m), and should produce
growth in real private consumption next year of 4.3 per cent. An
accompanying upgrade of training programmes is designed to improve workforce
skills.
Forecasts by the Finance Ministry point to a surge in the GDP growth rate
from about 1 per cent this year to 3.1 per cent in 1994, with private
consumption next year rising by 4.3 per cent in real terms.
According to Mr Rasmussen, Denmark's large surplus on the current account of
the balance of payments, low inflation rate and relatively strong government
finances mean that the country can afford these measures. However, the
Danish government, which currently holds the EC presidency, is calling for a
co-ordinated pragmatic policy for economic recovery. It will be pushing hard
for this at next month's Copenhagen summit.
But when it comes to the Community's more ambitious long-term plans for
economic and political union, enshrined in Maastricht, Denmark's approach
will be severely constrained by the painful experience of the two
referendums. Future government's will not be allowed to depart from the
provisions of the Edinburgh opt-outs agreement, which exempted Denmark from
participation in the common currency, defence co-operation, legal and police
co-operation and common citizenship.
Denmark's strong economy makes it a natural candidate for participating in
the third and final stage of European monetary union, a move which is
supported by the business community. But Mr Rasmussen said this week that
the government would stick by the Edinburgh opt-out on the common currency:
'That is the position of this government,' he said.
The right-wing Liberal party, led by Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, foreign
minister for more than 10 years until last January, has already espoused the
cause of dropping the Edinburgh opt-outs at a later date. Like all the other
political parties, though, it has promised to submit any changes in the
Edinburgh deal to further plebiscites.
The provocative Mr Ellemann-Jensen's cause has found few supporters. After a
long and divisive debate on the Maastricht issue, most politicians want to
see a restoration of national consensus on the European issue.
This may not be as difficult as might be imagined. Tuesday night's riots
notwithstanding, the debate has generally been conducted in a friendly
spirit.
The riots, said Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, foreign minister, 'are in no way
an expression of what the majority of No voters feel. We are not a deeply
divided society. We have had a referendum and therefore there have been
differences of opinion, but the differences will disappear again from
today.'

Community of 16
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
DENMARK'S Yes to Maastricht means talks will go ahead on EC membership by
1995 for Sweden, Finland and Norway and Austria. However, it is by no means
a foregone conclusion that the citizens of all four applicants will want to
join.
Opinion polls indicate that probably none of them could muster a majority
for entry at present - and all of them will hold a referendum before
deciding.
The four governments are looking to the Danish outcome to lift waning
enthusiasm about membership. As Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's prime
minister, underlined last month, 'the Danish No (of last June) broke an
upward trend for unification all over Europe'. A Yes now, she said, was a
vital precondition to turn that trend around.
All applicants except Finland need big turnarounds, and all need perceived
victories for often uncompromising demands. Moreover, it has been made clear
that they must accept not only existing EC legislation, but the full
Maastricht treaty. Opt-outs of the type conceded to Denmark and Britain are
only for existing members of the club.
As Mr Hans van den Broek, commissioner in charge of the negotiations, made
clear on Tuesday night as the Danish results came in: 'If the outcome. . . .
had been No, there would have been no Maastricht treaty and no basis on
which to conduct the enlargement negotiations.' This rigid posture is the
official policy of all 12 existing member states; not even the UK has
demurred.
Getting the negotiations started before ratification of Maastricht was a
feat in itself. The original, federalist-minded six member states suspected
that semi-detached late-joiners such as Britain and Denmark wished to dilute
European political and monetary union by taking in their own former
colleagues in the European Free Trade Association (Efta). Southern member
states such as Spain worry about a shift northwards in the EC's centre of
political gravity. The caricature of both views is that the British and the
Danes want simply a loose free trade area with a few indispensable political
frills.
However, the new entrants say they want to participate in the monetary
union, and the common foreign and security policy laid down by Maastricht.
Though all except Norway are militarily neutral, they are cautiously
receptive to an eventual European defence arrangement in the post-cold war
era. Moreover, they favour a 'deepening' in areas such as environment and
social policy, with more of the majority voting which Britain sees as
eroding sovereignty.
With negotiations at an early stage, it is not clear whether the applicants
can get satisfaction. Even less clear is whether federalists like the
Benelux countries will insist that decision-making procedures designed for
six members, already creaking with 12, must be reformed before the EC
expands to 16 and more.

STRIKING east German metal and electrical workers began returning to work
yesterday after accepting last Friday's so-called Saxony compromise
postponing by two years equalisation of wages in the two parts of the
country.
However, IG Metall, the powerful engineering union, is insisting the strikes
will continue unless wages for the steel sector match those in the metal and
electrical industries.
Union officials in Berlin-Brandenburg, where most of the steel sector is
located, said the agreement widens the income differentials between steel
and metal workers. Over 7,000 steel workers have been on strike for the past
16 days.

FT  20 MAY 93 / SPD urges jail terms for insider dealing in shares

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S opposition Social Democrats yesterday called for statutory jail
sentences to deter insider dealing in shares, as Mr Franz Steinkuhler,
leader of the country's most powerful union, struggled to contain calls for
his resignation from his own rank and file.
The leader of the IG Metall engineering union has denied insider dealing,
but admits speculating in almost DM1m (Pounds 400,000) worth of shares in
MAH, a Daimler-Benz holding company.
He is on the Daimler supervisory board, which decided to dissolve MAH and
exchange its shares for full Daimler shares on April 2 - causing a 20 per
cent jump in the MAH share price. Mr Steinkuhler admits to making a profit
of DM64,000.
The affair threatened further ramifications yesterday when Mr Hilmar Kopper,
chief executive of Deutsche Bank and chairman of the Daimler supervisory
board, came under strong attack from shareholders at his bank's annual
meeting for the way the decision to dissolve MAH was announced.
Daimler made the announcement at 4 pm on April 2, well after the close of
floor trading on German stock exchanges. However, it prompted a sharp rise
in the MAH share price in trading conducted over the IBIS electronic dealing
system.
Meanwhile, BfG Bank, the former trade union bank that carried out Mr
Steinkuhler's share purchases, is investigating how information had been
leaked to the press.
Pressure for legislation to control insider dealing - not an offence in
Germany - was fuelled by Mr Uwe Jens, SPD economics spokesman. He called for
a law based on US legislation, which provides for up to two years in prison.
'It needs a jail sentence to provide an adequate deterrent.'
Although he refused to comment on the Steinkuhler case, other members of the
SPD have joined calls for him to quit, as have rank-and-file members of IG
Metall.

FT  20 MAY 93 / EC must now make the treaty work: Denmark's approval of
Maastricht presents dual challenge for Community

NOW comes the hard part. After the decisive Danish Yes to the Maastricht
treaty, the EC faces a dual challenge: to recapture public support for
European integration and to make the much-abused treaty work.
Ever since Danish voters rejected the Maastricht treaty last June, the EC
has been trapped in what Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president,
calls a period of depression and inaction - a reflection of his own state of
mind as much as the mood in the Brussels bureaucracy.
But on Tuesday night, as the first exit polls showed a resounding Yes,
European commissioners came bounding into the underground press room in the
Bredel headquarters. For the first time in months the made-for-TV smiles
looked genuine. 'We can breathe again,' said one EC ambassador.
The Danish endorsement of Maastricht will most likely hasten ratification in
the UK, the lone treaty hold-out; more important, it builds on the Edinburgh
summit last December when the UK presidency engineered a series of deals on
the EC budget and enlargement which gave the Community a more secure
framework for its development to the year 2000.
The billion Ecu question is whether this framework will be of the loose
variety favoured by Britain and the Danes, or whether federalist forces in
Belgium, the Netherlands and the Commission will try to force the pace
toward closer political and monetary integration.
The Danish vote does not provide an answer, because it does not represent a
true test of public support for European union. The version of Maastricht
which Denmark approved on Tuesday contains legally-binding opt-outs on core
elements of the treaty, including the single European currency, EC
citizenship, and defence policy.
Yet in the short-run, the special Danish deal may not matter. The battle to
ratify Maastricht has come to resemble a religious war; now is the time,
says one senior EC official, to focus on 'real' issues such as rising
unemployment, low investment, monetary stability as well as the political
and economic integration of eastern Europe.
The first test of whether the Community has put an end to its introspection
will be the EC summit in Copenhagen on June 21-22. Leaders will be asked to
approve a bolder-than-expected Commission paper proposing accelerated trade
liberalisation with Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak republics,
Bulgaria and Romania.
Failure to reach agreement would not only be a slap in the face for the
emerging democracies in eastern Europe; it would signal growing support for
protectionism in France, Spain and Portugal and would bode ill for efforts
to reach agreement on a far-reaching market access package in the Gatt
Uruguay Round talks at the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo in July.
The second summit test is whether member states can restore growth to their
economies, reversing the rise in unemployment which will top 17.5m in the EC
this year.
The Danish presidency and Mr Delors are pushing hard for a strengthened
growth package, with member states shifting more resources into capital
spending. But severe constraints remain, because of the Maastricht
'convergence criteria' covering targets for inflation, budget deficits and
government debt which member states must meet in order to qualify for
monetary union.
At present, only Luxembourg qualifies on all three grounds. But when Mr
Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance minister, said last weekend that member
states should soften the convergence targets if recession continued into
next year, he received no audible support.
In Brussels yesterday, Mr Wilfried Martens, former Belgian prime minister
and president of the powerful Christian Democrat group of parties in Europe,
disowned his Belgian colleague. 'If we modify the criteria we would be
taking a large political and economic risk,' he said.
For the UK, which was forced out of the European exchange rate mechanism
(ERM) along with Italy last September, these divisions appear to confirm
what ministers concluded at the 1991 Maastricht summit: that the third phase
of monetary union was not, and never would be, feasible.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, went a step further recently. 'With
the Community bound together by shared interests,' he said, 'there must be
room for flexibility provided the core remains intact. I am not talking here
about a two-speed Europe, but of a Community which responds more flexibly to
the increased diversity of its members.'
This comes close to a Europe a la carte; but as a recent Royal Institute of
International Affairs paper points out, the EC is already moving towards 'an
uncertain pattern of co-operation in different groups on particular policy
areas'.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Tensions ease in exchange rate mechanism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK'S ratification of the Maastricht treaty continued to ease tensions
inside the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) yesterday, allowing
several countries to cut interest rates and leading to more investment in
currencies and bonds outside the D-Mark bloc.
The central banks of Denmark, Portugal and Sweden, all of which had followed
tight monetary policy to maintain their exchange rates against the D-Mark,
cut their official short-term interest rates yesterday.
Inside the ERM, Denmark reduced its discount rate by 1 percentage point to
8.25 per cent, while Portugal took 2 points off its 'mop up' rate, reducing
it to 13 per cent.
Sweden's central bank reduced its overnight lending rate by  1/4 of a
percentage point to 8.75 per cent, its fourth successive cut of a quarter
point in the past month.
The Danish vote also compounded the outflow of funds from the D-Mark into
the dollar and European currencies, as dealers took the view that monetary
union was back on track.
Sterling and the Italian lira both appreciated against the German currency
yesterday, despite the Bundesbank's decision not to reduce its official
interest rates at its fortnightly council meeting.
The German currency also fell to an historic low against the Japanese yen,
hitting Y68.05.
The yields on Italian, Swedish and Norwegian government bonds have also
fallen recently at the expense of German bonds.
Their yields were yesterday about 20 to 30 basis points lower than a week
ago.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Retail sales drop points to fragile recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRAGILE STATE of Britain's economic upturn was yesterday exposed by an
unexpected decline in retail sales, which last month fell for the first time
since the beginning of the year.
The figures follow poor manufacturing output figures earlier this week, and,
although analysts warned not to read too much into one month's figures, they
are the first sign that the UK recovery might not be on an uninterrupted
upward path.
The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that retail sales volumes fell
a seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent last month, compared with March. However,
sales were up strongly in the latest three months, a measure which the
government and independent economists take as a better guide to recent
trends.
In the three months to April, sales volumes rose by 1.4 per cent and were
3.2 per cent higher than in the same period a year earlier. Compared with
the same month a year ago, sales in April were 2.4 per cent higher compared
with growth of 4 per cent in the year to March.
Economists expect the recovery in the UK to be bumpy, following the
experience of the US, which is suffering from similar private sector debt
problems and where recent economic indicators have painted a conflicting
picture.
Concern over the economy was raised further when it emerged that the
government needed to borrow Pounds 4.69bn last month to finance public
spending, 34 per cent up from the figure for the same period last year. This
highlights the prospect of high deficits later in the year as a result of
the economic slowdown.
The weakness of April's retail sales figures was concentrated in food
retailers and mixed businesses, mainly department stores. Sales in both
sectors fell, while non-food retailers' sales were flat.
Over the three months to April growth was concentrated in the non-food
sector. Sales rose by 2.7 per cent compared with the previous three months.
Food retailers, whose sales held up relatively well during the recession,
have not fared so well since the beginning of the year. Sales volumes rose
by 0.5 per cent in the last three months. Sales for mixed business retailers
rose by only 0.1 per cent over the three months to April.
One reason for caution about the growth of sales is that heavy discounting,
which helped to underpin retail sales, appears to be coming to an end.
The Society of Business Economists also warns today that sluggish growth of
real incomes is likely to hold-back consumer spending. The Treasury stressed
that it was dangerous to read too much into one month's figures.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Major says UK still not ready for ERM move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday put off indefinitely sterling's re-entry into the
European exchange rate mechanism and made clear that Danish approval of
Maastricht would not change Britain's stand against European monetary union.
Ahead of a large-scale revolt expected by Tory MPs over the Maastricht
treaty today, the prime minister said the right conditions for considering
ERM re-entry 'simply do not apply at the moment and, in my judgment, are
unlikely to apply for some time in the future.'
At least 30 Conservative MPs are expected to vote against the government
tonight when the Commons gives the Maastricht treaty its third reading.
Similar numbers of Labour MPs will also vote against.
But the Labour leadership's decision to abstain means the government should
secure passage of the bill with ease. It then goes to the House of Lords.
Mr Major said the prospects of a rapid move towards European economic and
monetary union had 'drifted away very substantially'. He said the timetable
for Emu envisaged by other EC leaders at Maastricht had been 'unrealistic'.
However, he did not rule out the possibility of other countries moving to a
single currency without Britain.
His refusal to contemplate Britain's rejoining the ERM cheered Conservative
Euro-sceptics and came close to endorsing a prediction by Mr Kenneth Clarke,
home secretary, that Britain would not re-enter until after the next general
election. In practice, any early move would split the cabinet.
The Danes approved Maastricht by a margin of 56.8 per cent in favour to 43.2
per cent against, on an 86.2 per cent turnout, reversing the narrow
rejection of the treaty in a poll last June. The positive vote has also
given new impetus to the Danish presidency.
Denmark now intends to press for agreement on issues such as a new trade
liberalisation package for eastern Europe before Denmark hands over the
presidency to Belgium on July 1. In Brussels yesterday, Commission officials
hailed the Danish endorsement of the Maastricht treaty in Tuesday's second
referendum as giving a 'psychological lift' to the Community.
Despite euphoria among many European Community leaders at the Danish
referendum result, Mr Major's believes that there is support throughout the
EC, including Germany, for wholesale reform of the ERM.
'The ERM, as it was when we left it, is an inadequate instrument that we
could not re-enter,' Mr Major said on BBC radio. Downing Street rejected
suggestions that the prime minister was implying Britain might never rejoin
but said there remained 'big problems' with the ERM - although at least it
was no longer regarded as a quasi fixed rate system.
Officially, re-entry depends on conditions set by the Treasury on correcting
'faultlines' in the ERM and on bringing UK and Germany monetary polices into
line. One Euro-sceptic Tory MP said that 'the day we rejoin the ERM is the
day the Conservative party splits. There would be mass resignation from
government.'
With his comments on the ERM, however, Mr Major has risked upsetting the
pro-European Conservative wing, including Sir Edward Heath, former prime
minister. Mr Major said the Danish result should put British ratification of
the treaty back on track.

FT  20 MAY 93 / Treasury seeks tough NHS curbs: Portillo warns of hard
decisions on public spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY is pressing for effective withdrawal of the National Health
Service from dental care and the scrapping of free prescriptions for all but
the poor in its fundamental review of public spending.
The proposals - under consideration by a Whitehall committee set up by Mrs
Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary - foreshadow a fierce Whitehall
battle during coming months as ministers prepare the government's spending
plans for 1994-95 and after.
The proposals emerged as Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the
Treasury, pledged to keep public spending within its preset ceilings in the
next two financial years even though this risked 'courting unpopularity'.
In a speech last night to the Association of Investment Trust Companies, he
warned that the fundamental reviews being conducted by the Treasury of
spending by the health, social security and education departments and the
Home Office would 'throw up difficult decisions'.
Mr Portillo said the government could not and should not reduce its public
sector borrowing requirement solely by raising taxes. Higher taxes would
blunt incentives, erode competitiveness and create upward pressure on
interest rates, he warned.
However, in comments to Independent Television News, Mr Portillo appeared to
downplay the idea of limiting free prescriptions. 'I don't think it is one
of the leading options,' he said.
With Mr Portillo also demanding radical cuts in some social security
benefits, the Treasury proposals will add to concern among Conservative MPs
that the government's spending squeeze is pushing it towards an onslaught on
the welfare state.
The health committee is examining options to reduce the number of services
provided by the NHS and at the same time increase its revenue base.
Ministers believe some suggestions, such as the introduction of 'hotel
charges' for hospital stays, will be dropped.
And despite Mr Portillo's insistence that spending ministers must be ready
to take hard decisions, the government's slim 18-seat majority may persuade
Mr John Major, the prime minister, that such cuts would prove politically
damaging. Mr Major made much in last year's general election campaign of his
determination to maintain the NHS as a free service at the point of
delivery.
The Treasury argues the NHS will not be able to meet demand for healthcare
without the proposed changes for prescriptions and dental care.
Only 20 per cent of people pay the Pounds 4.25 prescription charge. The
Treasury wants to increase this proportion to 80 per cent by limiting
exemptions to people on income support and thus cut the Pounds 3bn NHS drugs
bill. It also wants to take up a British Dental Association proposal that
the NHS should pay only for dental treatment for children and the poor.
Last night, Mr David Blunkett, Labour's health spokesman, said the
government was preparing the ground for a major extension of NHS charges.
'Mrs Bottomley is clearly losing her battle with the Treasury. This is an
outrageous attack on the sick, both old and young, and should be stopped in
its tracks.'
The cabinet is expected to meet in June to set the framework for talks on
public spending before November's first unified Budget. The Treasury's aim
will be to secure unanimous agreement that spending in the next three years
should be tightly controlled.
Mr Portillo has been meeting spending ministers in recent weeks to stress
the need to hold the government's 'control total' for public spending within
the planned Pounds 253.6bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 263.3bn in 1995-96.
In his speech yesterday, Mr Portillo said public spending was expected to
have risen nearly three times faster than tax revenues in the five years to
April 1994. Estimated tax revenues would rise by Pounds 38bn while public
spending would go up by Pounds 101bn. Spending had risen 17 per cent in real
terms since 1988 while output had not grown at all.

FT  19 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: TV stocks firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Television stocks perked up on the implications of the sale by WH Smith of
its 14 per cent stake in Yorkshire Tele-vision.
Smith sold its 7m shares at 200p apiece to LWT Holdings, which subsequently
announced that it was taking over Yorkshire's crumbling advertising sales
section. The stake sale had been anticipated for some time and had prompted
a certain amount of bid speculation.
The appearance of LWT removes the potential bid value but replaces it with a
more comforting shareholder fit and a much-needed advertising boost,
analysts said. The shares rose 13 on the news before closing a net 6 ahead
at 178p.
The focus on advertising also encompassed Anglia TV, 7 up at 286p, and
Scottish TV, 6 better at 569p. WH Smith 'A' slipped 2 to 438p.
Switching from Lloyds Bank into Barclays saw the latter advance 7 to 446p on
hefty turnover of 4.9m shares and the former slip 3 to 542p on 4.1m traded.
First-quarter figures from Sedgwick, the insurance broker, were Pounds 1.5m
below most expectations. Sedgwick shares receded 3 to 167p on above-average
turnover of 3.2m.
Fisons shed 7 to 165p as the sale of its North American horticulture
business for Dollars 60m failed to reassure.
Gases and healthcare group BOC fell 17 to 681p as the company reported
improved first-half profits but said that the outlook was sluggish.
GEC was among the market's most heavily traded stocks, closing 2 harder at
319p, with at least two leading broking houses said to be keenly supporting
the shares.
Linx Printing Technologies lost 36 at 139p, after 121p, following a profits
warning.
The market appreciated the terms of the well signposted rights issue from
British Airways. The Pounds 442m cash call was announced with year-end
results of Pounds 185m, at the bottom end of market expectations. However,
analysts were encouraged by the fact that one-off items had played a
significant part in the profits decline and future prospects looked good.
The shares finished just a halfpenny softer at 296 1/2 p after trade of
3.3m.
Securiguard, the business services group, jumped 104 to 289p after
environmental services company Rentokil surprised the market by launching a
hostile Pounds 59.2m bid to help its move into security services in the UK
and US.
The company urged investors not to accept the 270p a share offer and
analysts predicted a long battle. The shares are tightly held and turnover
was thin. Rentokil relinquished 4 to 193p.
Fears of stiffer US competition for TI Group prompted the shares to dip 4 to
326p. The fears surround TI's landing gear manufacturing business following
the takeover of a US rival.
The 95 per cent drop in interim profits at Fenner left the shares 6 lighter
at 77p.
Results from Allied-Lyons came in line with market forecasts and the shares
marked time at 543p.
Leading textiles groups were boosted by the Marks and Spencer figures, which
hinted at improved volumes. SG Warburg's textiles analyst said there were
relative merits for the suppliers. Coats Viyella put on 3 at 237p ahead of a
presentation by Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken on Friday. Courtaulds Textiles rose 10
to 544p.

FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Leading US store chains turn in
contrasting results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTRASTING fortunes in the US retail sector were evident yesterday, when
Dayton Hudson and JC Penney, two of the nation's largest store chains,
unveiled first-quarter results.
JC Penney, the Texas-based department store group, enjoyed a fairly strong
three-month period to May 1. Total sales rose by 4.5 per cent, to Dollars
3.96bn, and with selling costs remaining static and interest charges falling
slightly, net profits before extraordinary items and accounting-related
items, stood at Dollars 172m, compared with Dollars 136m a year earlier.
JC Penney said its gross margin fell from 34.1 per cent to 33.9 per cent, as
a result of its lower pricing strategy. But selling, general and
administrative expenses also fell, to 30 per cent of retail sales, against
31.5 per cent a year earlier.
After extraordinary items and the accounting related changes, net profits
reached Dollars 206m. Earnings per share, on the same basis, stood at 78
cents, against 52 cents. JC Penney shares edged  1/8 higher to Dollars 46 on
the news.
The company attributed the first-quarter results to its pricing strategies,
and said that it was still looking to strengthen stock management and
supplier relationships. Mr William Howell, chairman, also indicated that the
group was exploring possibilities in the 'private brand' area.
Dayton Hudson, by contrast, saw after-tax profits dip to Dollars 30m in the
same three-month period, after a one-off Dollars 3m charge, compared with
Dollars 35m profits last time. Sales reached Dollars 4.04bn, compared with
Dollars 3.72bn.
'We have been disappointed by our sales results since the middle of
February,' commented Mr Kenneth Macke, chairman. 'Consumers are very
cautious. Part of that is due to pervasive economic concerns, such as
uncertainties about job security, tax increases and the cost of health care
reform.'
He added that the problems had been particularly noticeable at Mervyn's, the
middle-market department store chain. Operating profits fell in this
division due to lower-than-expected sales - in turn, blamed partly on
insufficient promotional activity. Gross margins at the department store
division, which takes in Marshall Field's, were flat.
However, the Target discount store chain, did record a small increase in
operating profits, although gross margins were adversely affected by the
continued 'value pricing' strategy and weak seasonal sales.

FT  19 MAY 93 / International Bonds: Toyota Motor priced to ensure strong
demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S Dollars 250m three-year deal from Toyota Motor Finance, which
was arranged by Credit Suisse First Boston, was priced attractively to
ensure strong demand, according to dealers.
The pricing of the deal was said to have been influenced by the
disappointing performance of General Electric Capital Corporation's Dollars
200m three-year deal, which was launched at 16 basis points over the
comparable US Treasury yield last week.
This level was considered too aggressive. Yesterday, the deal traded as wide
as 23 basis points, according to several traders.
By comparison, the Toyota Motor Finance deal appeared attractively priced at
33 basis points over the three-year US Treasury yield.
Although Toyota Motor would typically need to be priced at a wider spread
than GECC, even though both have triple-A ratings, the 10 basis point
differential favoured the Toyota deal, according to traders.
By the end of the day, the Toyota spread had tightened by a basis point or
two.
In the floating-rate note market, Credito Italiano launched a Dollars 75m
issue, increased to Dollars 100m, using the popular collared structure,
incorporating minimum and maximum coupon levels.
The minimum coupon of 6 per cent, the highest seen on a collared floater,
encouraged strong retail demand, even though the debt is subordinated.
Two UK building societies, the Nationwide and the National &amp; Provincial, had
their AA3-rated long-term debt placed under review for possible downgrade by
Moody's yesterday. A downgrade would take both borrower's debt below the AA
threshold applied by a number of investment managers, and could increase
their funding costs.
Moody's cited concerns about asset quality and core earnings in the current
competitive environment.
Mr Alastair Lyons, N&amp;P's finance director, said the building society has no
requirement to access the medium-term market this year, and will concentrate
on the short-term market.
Mr Richard Lassen, treasury director of Nationwide, which had its debt
placed under review lat year, but was not downgraded, said that the society
will be a net repayer of debt this year.
Both had their Prime-1 commercial paper ratings confirmed.

FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Siam Cement first-quarter
profits almost halved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIAM CEMENT, Thailand's leading industrial group, reported a 49 per cent
fall in consolidated net profits for the first quarter of 1993 to Bt694.54m
(Dollars 27.51m).
Sales of cement, approximately half the group's output, held up well but
earnings were hit by fierce price competition, a sharp increase in capacity
and higher depreciation and interest charges.
Mr Francis Middlehurst, an analyst with Crosby Research said domestic demand
for cement had increased but export markets proved more difficult than
expected because of the high transport costs.
First Asia Securities' analyst Colleen Duggan said the problems of the whole
group - from building materials to car parts to pulp and paper - mirrored
that of the economy.
'Siam Cement is practically everywhere dealing with producers expanding in
the midst of oversupply. This is depressing a lot of industrial earnings and
almost the entire construction sector,' she said. First Asia recently halved
its group net profits forecast for Siam Cement this year to Bt2bn.
Post Publishing, publisher of the Bangkok Post, and just under 15 per cent
owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, reported first-quarter net profits
of Bt44.831m, down from Bt55.157m. Earnings were cut by the one-off expense
of moving into a new headquarters and the launch last summer of a Thai
language paper, the Siam Post, which is not expected to generate profits
until 1994.

FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Drew Scientific placing gives Pounds 25.2m
valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Drew Scientific, maker of diagnostic medical equipment, have been
placed at 105p, valuing the company, which will begin trading next Monday,
at Pounds 25.2m.
Close Brothers placed 6.99m shares - 29.1 per cent of the shares now in
issue - raising Pounds 3.4m net for the company and Pounds 3.08m for
existing shareholders.
Directors and their related interests hold 47.7 per cent of the enlarged
capital after the issue.
Drew's main product is the Glycomat, which uses consumable micro-column
liquid chromatography packs in the management and control of diabetes, one
of the world's most common diseases.
The company says the technology could be adopted to help tests for kidney
failure and to screen cancer.
Drew is not making a profits forecast. However, based on current production
of about 40 machines a month, and the sales of the high margin consumables
packs, some brokers say that at 105p, Drew is on a prospective earnings
multiple of about 17.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN Sugar's attempt to undermine the powerbase of Mr Terry Venables at
Tottenham Hotspur, the north London football club which the pair rescued in
1991, has turned to Mr Venables' one supporter on the board.
It is understood that Mr Jonathan Crystal, a barrister who joined the board
in August 1991, is to be asked to resign. Mr Sugar, who owns 48 per cent of
Tottenham's shares, has made it clear that he resents Mr Crystal's influence
over Mr Venables.
Another of Mr Venables' associates, Mr Eddie Ashby, who has acted as a
consultant at Tottenham, had his services terminated by the board on Monday.
The same meeting discussed Mr Crystal's directorship - in his absence -
including the possibility of holding an EGM to consider his removal.
On Friday, Mr Crystal was the only board member to vote against Mr Sugar's
move to sack Mr Venables as chief executive. He was later reinstated, by a
High Court order, until a hearing on May 25.

   H YOUNG Holdings lifted first half 1992
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
93 pre-tax profit from Pounds 427,000 to Pounds 532,000.
After a slow start the automotive and electronics distribution group showed
the beginning of an improvement in December.
This had continued to date with sales from continuing businesses 2 per cent
ahead of budget and 8 per cent up on last year. All divisions were ahead.
Mr John Wilson, chairman, said the increases were mainly attributable to the
introduction of new products, although the 'patchy improvement' in the
economy was showing in higher sales and orders in the last three months,
mainly in electronics.
Overall turnover in the six months ended March 31 1993 came to Pounds 16.3m
(Pounds 15.6m) and the operating profit to Pounds 749,000 (Pounds 638,000)
with continuing businesses accounting for Pounds 766,000 (Pounds 689,000).
Earnings per share worked through at 2.15p (1.72p) and the interim dividend
is held at 2p.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Bosnia plan championed by Kozyrev
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, yesterday met Serbian, Croatian
and Bosnian leaders in an attempt to promote Moscow's proposal for a
step-by-step implementation of the Vance-Owen peace plan for
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
In an apparent reference to US criticism and Washington's refusal to attend
a proposed UN Security Council session, Mr Kozyrev went out of his way to
defend the plan to divide Bosnia into 10 provinces along ethnic lines.
'A better alternative to the Vance-Owen plan simply doesn't exist. . . it
would be a continuation of bloodshed,' he said.
On arriving in Belgrade for talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic
and his Yugoslav and Montenegrin counterparts, Mr Kozyrev described their
support for the plan as more important than its rejection by Bosnian Serbs
in their weekend referendum.
The foreign minister tried to play down a rift with the US over the plan,
saying that he and Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, were in
close contact and that it was no more than 'a difference in timing' over
when the Security Council should meet to discuss the latest Russian
proposals.
Earlier yesterday Mr Kozyrev met Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem president
of Bosnia, and Mr Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian president, in Split on the
Adriatic coast. Talks centred on ways to broker a lasting ceasefire between
the Croats and Moslems, formerly allies, in Mostar, south-western Bosnia.
The Russian delegation said it had gained the approval of Mr Tudjman for the
deployment of international monitors along the frontier between Croatia and
Bosnia.
Mr Kozyrev said he was unsure when Mr Milosevic would decide on deployment
of monitors on the Serbian-Bosnian border. The Serbian president had
previously insisted that this depended on deployment on Croatia's borders
with Bosnia.
Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators, also
held talks with the Croatian and Bosnian presidents in Split in an attempt
to win their commitment to a lasting ceasefire between Bosnian Croats and
Moslems and a reaffirmation of their endorsement of the peace plan. As the
rival presidents traded accusations about who was responsible for the
fighting, Lord Owen said: 'I am sick and tired of agreements being signed
like confetti.'
He said the former Yugoslav republic could become a Lebanon in Europe and
that fighting would spread beyond its frontiers if Bosnia crumbled into
separate ethnic state-lets.
'If Croats and Moslems cannot live together, side by side, there will not be
a Bosnia-Hercegovina. There are enough obstacles from the Serb side
already,' Lord Owen said.
'There is no way I can imagine the Moslem population will allow the
partition of the country. They will fight. It will be like Lebanon.
'They will go on fighting and fighting and fighting and that contagion will
spread to Serbia and Croatia.'

FT  19 MAY 93 / Liberals shake up Austrian politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC FREY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE surprise showing by a new liberal party in Austria's regional elections
has altered the political landscape. The Liberal Forum, which split from the
right-wing Freedom Party (FPOe) early this year, gained 5.1 per cent of the
vote and three seats in the province of Lower Austria in its first try at
the polls.
The result reinforced the erosion of support for the two largest parties,
the conservative People's Party (OeVP) and the Social Democratic Party
(SPOe). The OeVP won 44.1 per cent of the vote, down 3.4 percentage points,
which cost it the absolute majority in the regional parliament it had held
for 48 years. The SPOe, at 34 per cent, was down by a similar margin.
The result was a personal triumph for Ms Heide Schmidt, founder of the
Liberal Forum, who, with four other members of parliament, left the FPOe in
protest against the rightward tilt engineered by its populist chairman, Mr
Jorg Haider.
The FPOe also gained in Lower Austria but because of the competition its 12
per cent share fell well short of recent results in other regions. Operating
with little money, no grass-roots organisation and with few prominent names
other than Ms Schmidt, the Liberal Forum also surpassed the more established
Greens, who fell short of the 4 per cent needed to gain a seat.
The fledgling party is now in a strong position to benefit from growing
disillusionment with the SPOe and the OeVP, which have dominated Austrian
politics since the second world war and are currently governing in a grand
coalition.
The appearance of the party has also added to the fragmentation of political
life, making the country harder to govern than in the stable two-party
system of the past. Ms Schmidt has not presented a detailed party programme,
but in public statements she has supported membership of the European
Community and more radical free-market policies.
Ever since Ms Schmidt left the FPOe following its controversial
anti-foreigner drive, Mr Haider's popularity has declined. He has become
increasingly isolated. The Liberal International has effectively expelled
the FPOe and is now poised to accept the Liberal Forum as a member.

FT  19 MAY 93 / BSN warning hits food shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices of leading European food companies fell yesterday after Mr
Antoine Riboud, chairman of BSN, France's largest food manufacturer, said it
was ready to cut prices to defend market share.
He said the company was operating 'in an unprecedented economic crisis',
while retailers were demanding larger discounts and providing stiffer
competition with cheap private-label ranges.
Mr Riboud's remarks added to investors' recent fears that international
recession and the growing power of food retailers would intensify price
competition.
His comments follow cautious forecasts by other large food and consumer
groups in the US and Europe, and what were widely considered disappointing
first quarter results from Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch manufacturer.
Many branded international manufacturers of consumer products have been
jolted by last month's decision by Philip Morris to cut the US price of
Marlboro cigarettes.
Shares in BSN, which on Monday reported a 5.7 per cent drop in first-quarter
sales, fell FFr11 to close at FFr863 yesterday. In London, Mr Riboud's
comments added to anxiety about the impact of sterling's recent recovery on
food groups with a large international exposure.
Cadbury Schweppes fell 9p to 447p and United Biscuits by 9p to 412p, while
Unilever fell 22p to 1036p in London and Fl 1.80 to Fl 193.20 in Amsterdam.
In Zurich, however, Nestle registered shares rose SFr15 to SFr1130.
Mr Riboud said BSN aimed to offset the impact on profit margins of any price
reductions by cutting costs. The company might also have to weed out weaker
brands which were squeezed between market leaders and private label
products.
Analysts believe BSN is most vulnerable to price competition in mineral
water, of which it is the world's second largest producer.

Up-market retailer Marks and Spencer saw its shares roller coaster through a
20-point turnround as it reported full year results.
The figures came in at the top end of expectations and the shares surged on
the news. However, a seemingly downbeat analysts meeting, followed by
further inspection of the results, saw the stock marked back sharply. It
finished 9 1/2 down at 345 1/2 p after turnover of 12m. Kleinwort Benson was
one of a number of brokers said to have moved the stock off its buy list to
a hold.
Stores specialists said that while the figures confirmed M and S's premium
market rating, the prospective earnings growth was around half the average
forecast for the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index in the next year. 'Investors
are looking for more dynamic recovery stocks than M and S,' was the comment
from one stores analyst.
One of the issues to unsettle the market and compound the uncertainties over
earnings growth was the size of the company's proposed wage award. Rumours
late in the day that M and S might be considering a fund-raising exercise to
tie into low interest rates were dismissed by analysts.

International conglomerate BAT Industries and Hanson failed to inspire the
market with their respective trading statements and results.
BAT, which has suffered heavily over US cigarette price war worries, was
particularly hit as a cautious annual statement highlighted the sluggish
world economy and the continuing US concerns. The shares weakened 24 to
844p.
Hanson's half-year profits of Pounds 507m were at the top end of forecasts
but the company said most of its markets remained gripped by recession and
it would see little, if any, boost in 1993 from the tentative evidence of an
upturn. Investors saw a chance to take profits and sold the shares down 5
1/4 to 237 3/4 p on hefty 10m turnover.
Mr Paul Beaufrere of agency broker James Capel favours Hanson more than BAT
but argues that both companies were now offering a solid yield above 6 per
cent and should be bought by long term investors.

Reports of aggressive views from the chairman of French food manufacturer
BSN weakened related stocks in the London market.
Mr Antoine Riboud said BSN was being pressured by retailers to lower prices.
While resisting this, he said the group would respond aggressively on price
to protect its market share. Food specialists also took fright at comments
on the downturn in trading in Europe as recession took its toll.
United Biscuits fell 9 to 412p. BSN is the top biscuit producer in Europe.
Unilever, which competes with BSN on some frozen products, lost 22 to 1036p.
Cadbury Schweppes relinquished 9 to 447p.

FT  19 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Positive stance on generators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CHANGE of stance by one of the market's leading securities houses saw the
two English power generators substantially outperform the utilities areas
and the wider market.
SG Warburg Securities was said by dealers to have shifted its recommendation
on National Power and PowerGen from 'add' to 'buy'. Warburg was said to have
emphasised the two companies' 'extremely encouraging' dividend growth
prospects, and to have told its clients that it was not unduly concerned by
the supposed regulatory threat to the two stocks.
National Power raced up to end 9 higher at 333p on turnover of 2.6m shares,
while PowerGen settled the same amount to the good at 343p after trade of
3.4m.
Along with other brokers, Warburg expects the generators to achieve dividend
increases of 15 per cent or more over the next few years. The regional
electricity companies are scheduled to report preliminary results starting
next month and are expected to post dividend rises of up to 15 per cent.
Scottish Power, expected to announce a 10 per cent increase in the dividend
total when it announces its full year results tomorrow, moved up 4 to 311p.
The strength of the generators' shares powered the electricity sub-sector of
the FT- Actuaries Indices to a 1.1 per cent rise, compared with a 0.3 per
cent gain in the water sub-sector and a 0.4 per cent decline in the FT-SE
100 Index.

<TEXT>
A BOUT of nerves concerning interest rates in both the US and Germany,
worries over the outcome of yesterday's referendum in Denmark on the
Maastricht treaty, and poor economic UK data combined to bring a retreat in
stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 2,864, around the level of the
previous night's close, but drifted down on concern about the progress of
polling in Denmark and on whether the Bundesbank will reduce interest rates
today.
The release at 11.30am of UK industrial output figures showing a 1.3 per
cent fall served to increase the downward pressure on the contract.
Worries about US interest rates and the poor performance of Wall Street
brought a further decline and June fell to the day's low of 2,854, although
bargain hunting saw it come off the bottom to close at 2,858, around 7
points ahead of its fair value premium to cash. Turnover remained light,
totalling 7,527 lots.
In traded options, volume improved to reach 29,395 contracts, of which 7,163
were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 1,995 in the Euro FT-SE 100 option.
Hanson, which reported figures yesterday, was the busiest stock option at
4,055 lots. It was followed by Marks and Spencer, which also reported
figures, at 2,038. Glaxo, BT and BTR were other active stock options.

FT  19 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: US worries hit London share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRISSON of nervousness over US interest rates ran through the London stock
market yesterday afternoon, helping to undermine confidence which had been
boosted at first by favourable reports on retail sales from the
Confederation of British Industry.
An early gain of 11 points on the Footsie was cut back after official
statistics for March showed a fall of 0.3 per cent in domestic manufacturing
output and of 1.3 per cent in industrial production. This cast a shadow over
the progress of the economic recovery implied by the CBI report.
Equities had also been helped at the opening of trading by favourable
corporate trading reports. Results from British Airways were overshadowed by
the expected rights issue which, at Pounds 442m, was a shade smaller than
the market had been expecting. Profits and dividend from Marks and Spencer,
the premium high street retailer, were well received and, although the
shares turned down later, traders rejected market gossip of a possible
rights issue.
The UK economic data unsettled equities, which were soon given further
downward impetus from the stock index futures, where the June Footsie
contract dipped to a discount to fair value for much of the session.
With the institutions clearly taking a reserved attitude - retail business
only just cleared the Pounds 1bn mark on Monday - shares extended their
losses.
However, the more significant blow to the market came when London traders
caught the hint of New York worries that the revived concern over inflation
may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. With hopes of a rate
cut at today's Bundesbank meeting also fading fast, the UK market fell more
than 12 points to a day's low of 2,845.9. London's unhappiness was pressed
home by an early decline of 16 points in New York's Dow Industrial Average.
At the close the FT-SE 100 Index, sustained by a rally in stock index
futures, was down 10.8 on the day at 2,847.3. Although Seaq volume increased
to 633.4m shares from the previous day's 533.8m, traders stressed that
genuine customer business remained relatively poor.
Continued activity among the second line issues brought a gain of 5.2 to
3,151.2 in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which earlier mounted another challenge
to its previous peak of 3,154.7. Non-Footsie trades made up only about 56
per cent of the day's total, however, reflecting the concentration on a
heavy list of blue chip profits announcements.
London strategists put the best face possible on yesterday's market
performance, but admitted that uncertainty over the pace of the economic
recovery in the UK has been joined by worries over the outlook in
continental Europe and in the US.
Warnings of competitive strains in the food industry from BSN, of France,
unsettled Unilever and some other food industry issues - although these
factors were counterbalanced by renewed hints of impending acquisition
moves.
Nor did confirmation of British Airways' funding move, and firm rejection of
any such plans by Allied-Lyons, remove the market's fears that it could be
hit by further rights issues on top of the BT III sale and a heavy funding
programme in the gilt-edged market.

FT  19 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow shows resilience to
interest rate fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
ANOTHER rise in bond yields, combined with worries about inflation and
interest rate prospects, pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average blue chip
indicator down initially yesterday, but by the close most of the fall had
been recovered, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Average was finally just 5.54 easier at 3,444.39 after a day's low
of 3,422.52. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 0.05 off at 440.32, while the
Nasdaq composite gained 2.82 at 680.78. Trading volume on the New York SE
was 264.3m shares.
The dominant concern of the markets remained inflation and interest rates.
Since last week's poor consumer and producer prices data, long-term bond
yields have risen from 6.8 per cent to almost 7 per cent.
This rise in yields has unnerved equity investors, who fear that higher
interest rates may be around the corner, primarily because the Federal
Reserve may react to rising inflation by tightening monetary policy. Higher
rates would hinder corporate profitability, and make equities considerably
less attractive relative to other financial assets.
Although this concern kept many share prices in check yesterday, secondary
stocks traded on the electronic Nasdaq market managed to post some solid
gains.
The day's only economic news - a 6.7 per cent increase in April housing
starts - was in line with expectations and had little effect on the market.
A bright feature on the NYSE was Hewlett-Packard, which jumped Dollars 5 to
Dollars 84 5/8 in volume of 3.3m shares after announcing stronger than
expected net income of Dollars 1.38 a share for the fiscal second quarter.
At the same stage a year earlier the company earned Dollars 1.27 a share.
The news from Hewlett-Packard buoyed other computer stocks. Compaq advanced
Dollars 2 to Dollars 55 3/8 , IBM Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 49, Motorola
Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 78 and Digital Equipment Dollars 1 to Dollars 47
1/4 .
The main indices would have been higher but for sizeable losses in selected
big stocks, including Ford, down Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 53 1/2 , and
Caterpillar, Dollars 1 cheaper at Dollars 68.
Home Depot was another stock lifted by good earnings news. The retailer rose
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 44 1/8 in volume of 2.6m shares on reporting
first-quarter profits of 24 cents a share, against the 18 cents earned a
year ago.
Cummins Engine dropped Dollars 5 3/8 to Dollars 86 3/4 after brokerage house
Prudential Securities lowered its rating on the stock from 'buy' to 'hold'
following the recent release of disappointing truck orders figures.
Canada
TORONTO advanced in heavy trading, boosted by a renewed surge in gold
shares. The TSE 300 index ended 34.3 stronger at 3,826.8 and rises outpaced
declines by 372 to 318. Volume reached 75.6m shares and the trading value
was CDollars 716.3m.
Ten of the 14 stock group indices ended higher, led by the golds sector,
which jumped 5.75 per cent.
Golds had retreated somewhat over the previous two sessions, following a
six-day winning streak fuelled by sharp increases in the price of the
precious metal. The New York spot gold price yesterday climbed USDollars
7.90 an ounce on a slide in the US bond market.

FT  19 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich registers second
consecutive record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Danish Maastricht vote was given credit yesterday for buoyancy in a
number of bourses which, on examination, seemed to be climbing for reasons
of their own, writes Our Markets Staff.
ZURICH reported institutional and options-related buying which took the SMI
index up 21.7 to a second consecutive record close of 2,226.7.
Foreign investors were also active buyers on the view that the market is
currently undervalued. The firmer dollar encouraged demand for chemicals
issues while lower interest rates helped financials.
Roche certificates were the most activley traded issue, gaining SFr40 to
SFr4,630. Sandoz registered shares found renewed demand adding SFr70 to
SFr3,070.
Among financials, UBS bearers rose SFr14 to SFr967 while Zurich Insurance,
expected to benefit strongly from a US economic pick-up, added SFr40 to
SFr2,290. Winterthur Insurance registered shares rose SFr20 to SFr3,260 as
it announced plans to convert non-voting participation certificates into
registered shares and to split its resistered and bearer shares.
MADRID returned to the upgrade, the general index closing 3.93, or 1.6 per
cent higher at 256.89. Turnover rose from Pta20.2bn to an estimated Pta30bn.
Interest rate sensitive stocks did well, BBV rising Pta75 to Pta3,145 among
rising banks and Iberdrola by Pta23 to Pta748 in a relatively more buoyant
utilities sector.
Among builders and electricals, Huarte, the subject of takeover speculation,
put on Pta85 at Pta557 with more than  1/2 m shares traded. Cristaleria
gained 5.1 per cent, and Agroman 3.5 per cent.
PARIS regained some ground in technical trading after recent weakness, but
interest remained subdued ahead of the Ascension day holiday. The CAC-40
index improved 10.68 to 1,846.40 after a day's high of 1,861. Turnover was
strong at FFr3.8bn.
BSN went against the rising trend on plans to cut prices in an effort to
retain market share for its products in Europe, where it ranks third behind
Nestle and Unilever. Some analysts commented that the group, with relatively
negligible dollar exposure, was finding it very difficult to squeeze volume
growth out of any of its divisions. The shares finished FFr11 weaker at
FFr863.
Elf Sanofi roseFFr41 or 4.6 per cent to FFr935 as shareholders finally
approved the acquisition of YSL, thereby creating the world's third largest
beauty products group.
MILAN staged a broad advance as the strength of the lira again prompted
hopes that the Bank of Italy would act soon to cut interest rates. The Comit
index rose 4.64 to 544.19.
The market began weak but picked up later. Fiat shed L224 to fix at L6,327
before rebounding to L6,644 after hours with investors expecting the board
to cut the dividend at the end of the month.
Foreign demand help Credito Italiano and BCI to extend Monday's gains. Mr
Romano Prodi, appointed chairman of Iri at the weekend, is expected to
expedite privatisations. Credito added L166 or 5.6 per cent to L3,093 while
BCI put on L219 or 4.2 per cent L5,427.
Among telecoms, which are seeing strong foreign demand, Sip rose L19 to fix
at L1,956 before L1,974 after hours while Stet, its parent company, dipped
L39 to L2,960 but picked up to L3,060 on the kerb.
FRANKFURT saw a continued downward drift in bond prices as the repo rate
stayed at 7.60 per cent and the DAX index ended flat, closing 0.60 higher at
1,628.48 after an opening rally to 1,636.09.
Turnover recovered from DM4.7bn to DM5.7bn. Company news included a 10 per
cent drop in first quarter sales at the tyremaker, Continental, but the
company said that it would try to pay a dividend in 1993 and the shares rose
DM2.80 to DM198.80.
A drop in profits at Degussa, the chemicals, metals and pharmaceuticals
group, left it DM4.50 lower at DM329.50. Meanwhile, the threat of a dividend
cut at Altana, the chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, left the shares DM5
lower at DM535.
AMSTERDAM saw falls in Unilever, off Fl 1.80 at Fl 193.20, which reflected
the BSN news and Pakhoed, down Fl 1.40 to Fl 36.60, after it forecast a
sharp fall in first half 1993 profits. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.2
lower at 106.3.
STOCKHOLM was active in Volvo, which lost SKr8 to SKr400 following bigger
than expected first quarter losses. However, a strong performance from
Ericsson, up SKr7 to SKr313, supported the overall market as the
Affarsvarlden general index ended unchanged at 1,083.2. Turnover rose to
SKr1.4bn from Monday's SKr1.3bn.
HELSINKI rose by 3 per cent on hopes that the threatened strike in the
country's export sector would not start today. The HEX index jumped 34.00 to
1,184.7 after a 1.2 per cent fall on Monday.
WARSAW resumed its climb after a drop on Monday, the WIG index soaring by
237.2, or 8.2 per cent to 2,748.8 in turnover of 261.7bn zloty.
ISTANBUL's slide continued with a further loss of 2.5 per cent in the
75-share index, down 205.25 at 8,024.66.

FT  19 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo dips 1.6 per cent
on futures-led activity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PERSISTENT futures sales sparked unwinding of arbitrage positions in the
cash market, leaving equities 1.6 per cent lower in light trading, writes
Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average was down 336.12 at 20,229.39, after moving between a low
of 20,155.10 and high of 20,502.46. The Topix index of all first section
stocks lost 21.97 at 1,589.28, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was
0.35 firmer at 1,223.69.
First section volume came to 370m shares, up from Monday's 328m, while
declines overwhelmed advances by 907 to 163, with 106 issues unchanged.
Brokers said that, from the outset of trading, no major buyers were present
in the market. Without buy orders from government-managed public funds,
known to serve normally as a cushion for the Nikkei average on dips, equity
prices might have declined further, brokers added.
Increased futures activity is expected as investors attempt to protect
themselves against further Nikkei declines in a market which provides scant
incentives for inward investment.
However, said brokers, many institutional investors, including life
insurance companies, brokerages and Japanese corporations, were likely to
enter the stock market more aggressively if the Nikkei trades below 20,000.
An analyst at a UK stockbroker commented that investors are reacting
favourably to any positive developments in sectors or individual issues.
In spite of the day's declines, shipbuilding shares rose on a report about a
major conference among Asian countries concerning tanker safety, which
implied that new ships might be bought in the future. Equally, news of an
increase in the percentage of dollar denominated contracts, which will help
domestic operators in international bids, aided the sector.
Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding rose Y4 to Y452, Hitachi Zosen Y10 to
Y583 and Sasebo Heavy Y10 to Y558.
Profit-taking cut the gains of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which
relinquished Y22,000 to Y975,000. The weakness of that telecommunication
group spread to electrical wire and cable issues. Sumitomo Electric
Industries declined Y50 to Y1,130, Fujikura Y23 to Y997 and Furukawa
Electric Y24 to Y687.
Consumer electrical issues lost ground, Pioneer Electronic weakening Y160 to
Y2,400, Sony Y70 to Y4,650 and TDK Y60 to Y3,840.
The brokerage sector declined by about 2 per cent, Nomura slipping Y50 to
Y2,110, Daiwa Y50 to Y1,260 and Nikko Y20 to Y1,040.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 275.76 lower at 22,552.98 in volume of 17m
shares.
Roundup
THERE WERE fresh record highs in Hong Kong and Singapore. New Zealand was
closed owing to technical problems.
HONG KONG hit its new peak on optimism over Sino-British talks; negotiators
from both sides are due to meet in Beijing on Friday for a further round of
consultations. The Hang Seng index closed 25.18 higher at 7,149.30. Turnover
was also a record - HKDollars 8.1bn against Monday's HKDollars 7.7bn.
Performance of blue chips varied, brokers said. Cheung Kong was targeted by
profit-takers and shed 40 cents to HKDollars 27.20. The most active stock,
Hutchison Whampoa, dipped 10 cents to HKDollars 19.90.
Market laggards such as China Light benefited from bargain hunting and the
stock improved 50 cents to HKDollars 39.
SINGAPORE rebounded strongly from Monday's profit-taking as the Straits
Times Industrial index peaked 31.74 higher at 1,878.01 in volume of 365.6m
shares.
Brokers said demand for speculative Malaysian and second and third line
Singapore stocks was strong.
TAIWAN recovered from Monday's losses, with strong performances noted from
Formosa Plastics, up TDollars 1.10 at TDollars 44.20, and China Steel, which
appreciated 80 cents to TDollars 21.90. The weighted index improved 35.28 to
4,495.39. Turnover amounted to TDollars 23bn, against a previous TDollars
23.9bn.
MANILA lost ground after opening higher with the aid of firm mining issues.
The composite index dipped 19.90 to 1,596.14 in turnover down to 398m pesos
from 555m.
Philippine Long Distance Telephone receded 20 pesos to 970 pesos.
AUSTRALIA fell at the close as investors reacted to weakness in the
Australian dollar against the US currency. The All Ordinaries index shed 9.0
to 1,677.9 in turnover of ADollars 307.3m.
In the banking sector, ANZ was steady at ADollars 3.55 after selling its 7
per cent stake in Challenge Bank for ADollars 2.48 a share.
BANGKOK was lower following heavy losses among building materials companies.
The SET index fell 8.62 to 872.96 in moderate turnover of Bt3.1bn.

FT  19 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Gold bugs throw caution to the winds -
North American expression of the gold price phenomenon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Before the latest spurt in the gold price, many North American analysts were
urging investors in gold mining shares to be cautious. Handsome profits
could already be taken, and the value of most companies' ore reserves less
production costs did not appear to justify the heady level of share prices.
That advice has gone unheeded in the past week. The surge in the gold price
to almost Dollars 370 an ounce has uncorked yet another buying binge in the
stock market.
The climb in North American gold shares has far outstripped the bullion
price. The Toronto Stock Exchange's gold and silver index spurted ahead by
11.5 per cent last week. At its closing level of 8,234 on Monday, the index
had risen by 57 per cent so far this year, and by 67 per cent since the
start of 1992.
The most popular shares have been those with the highest sensitivity to
changes in the bullion price. Echo Bay Mines, whose earnings stand to climb
by 50 per cent for each 10 per cent rise in the gold price, jumped CDollars
4.25 last week to CDollars 14.25 in exceptionally heavy trading. Homestake
Mining, which has only a slightly lower leverage, has forged ahead in less
than a year from USDollars 9.63 to USDollars 17.88 on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Gold bugs have latched on to a spate of positive signals to justify their
bullishness. Mr George Soros, the heavyweight New York investment fund
manager, appeared to demonstrate his faith in the yellow metal last month by
buying a stake in Newmont Mining from Sir James Goldsmith. The fire was then
stoked by Sir James buying a big chunk of gold call options.
The bullion price has been propelled further by early signs of an upward
blip in the US inflation rate, and by reports that demand for high carat
gold jewellery has risen sharply in China and India over the past 18 months.
Mr Warren Myers, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York, has yet to be
convinced that higher inflation - the engine of four of the gold sector's
five past bull markets - is imminent. But he has little doubt that technical
indicators are pointing to a 'genuine turnround' in the gold market.
'There must be something new brewing which, stupidly, I have not yet seen,'
he says. Although caution remains his watchword, Mr Myers is advising
clients to hang on to such gold blue chips as American Barrick and Placer
Dome.
Thanks to the industry's most extensive hedging programme, Barrick is
guaranteed a price of at least Dollars 400 an ounce for its entire 1993 and
1994 output. It realised an average price of Dollars 410 an ounce in the
first quarter of this year, compared to the Comex average of Dollars 330.
Earnings are thus well protected against a possible reversal in the bullion
price.
Other analysts see little value in current share prices. Mr Barry Allan, at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Toronto, says it may be 'a couple of years' before
the bullion price reaches the levels of Dollars 400 an ounce and above now
being discounted by the stock market. If the gold price does keep rising, Mr
Allan worries that investors may be tempted to switch from equities to the
commodity markets.
Few would be bold enough to assert that shares have reached a ceiling for
the time being. But recent buyers of North American gold mining stocks will
probably need a sharp eye, a hard stomach and nimble footwork to ensure a
decent return on their investment.
Trading on Monday this week demonstrated that the relatively small market in
gold mining shares, estimated by one analyst at Dollars 40bn to Dollars 50bn
worldwide, can be as volatile coming down as going up. Although the Comex
June contract lost only 30 cents to Dollars 368, Toronto's gold and silver
index slipped by 1.5 per cent.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: DM weaker as Danes vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH the D-Mark and the Swiss franc continued to weaken in European trading
yesterday as dealers took the view that there would be a strong Yes vote in
Denmark's referendum on the Maastricht treaty, writes James Blitz.
The first exit polls following the referendum indicated last night that
there had been a comfortable victory for the Yes camp, although final
confirmation of the result was being awaited.
Nevertheless, the exit polls were clearly in line with the market's
expectations and suggested that tensions in the European exchange rate
mechanism were about to ease.
As on previous days, the expectation that the treaty would be ratified led
to unwinding of positions in both the D-Mark and the Swiss franc, both of
which have been viewed as safe haven currencies in the event of a No vote.
The dollar gained significantly from the D-Mark's weakness, rising more than
a pfennig to peak at DM1.6272 in Europe, and reaching a seven-week high. It
closed in London at DM1.6240, and later ended New York trading at DM1.6246.
Again, a factor pushing the dollar up against the German currency was
speculation that the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee would
lean towards tightening monetary policy following last week's higher than
expected figures for US inflation.
The results of the meeting, which took place yesterday and continues today,
will not be known for some weeks.
In Europe, expectations of a Yes vote led dealers to go long of several
currencies outside the D-Mark bloc and to short the Swiss franc, which
closed at SFr0.910 to the D-Mark from a previous SFr0.909.
The Italian lira was the best performer on the Continent, ending at L909.2
per D-Mark from a previous L914.9. The lira's rise partly reflected strong
buying of Italian bonds, with the five-year BTP future moving up more than
40 basis points on the day.
Sterling also enjoyed a strong performance, again driven by the same
factors. It finished at DM2.4875, a full pfennig higher on the day.
The clearest sign that the market was expecting a Yes vote was, of course,
the Danish krone's performance. Denmark's currency peaked at DKr3.8250 to
the D-Mark, and then weakened on profit-taking to end at around DKr3.8425.
Its divergence indicator against its Ecu central rate fell to around minus
37 basis points at the close of London trading, some 3 basis points higher
than at Monday's close.
An important question facing the market today is whether the D-Mark's
performance has been sufficiently bad in recent days to make the Bundesbank
think twice about cutting the discount rate at its council meeting today.
A 25 basis-point easing in the discount rate has been anticipated, but
several Bundesbank officials have recently expressed concern about the
dangers of imported inflation.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Money Markets: UK data awaited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS IN the sterling futures market yesterday pondered the possibility
that the UK might lower base rates again this year, as they awaited the Bank
of England's inflation report and a raft of economic indicators due later in
the week, writes James Blitz.
Both the June and September sterling interest rate contracts were pushed
higher, as dealers took the view that the unemployment data, scheduled for
release tomorrow, and the inflation data, expected on Friday, would point to
another cut in base rates later this year.
Weekend newspaper reports said the Bank would take a hard line on inflation
in its quarterly report, and this had pushed sterling futures down on
Monday.
However, dealers yesterday anticipated that the report, which was issued at
5pm last night, would reflect only mild concern about the prospects for
inflation. And they were right to do so.
In a chart printed at the end of the report, the Bank projected the
inflation rate as remaining within the target band of 1 to 4 per cent
outlined by the government for the next two years. 'The changes since the
last Inflation Report have lowered slightly both the expected inflation rate
and the probability of breaching the 4 per cent limit during the course of
this year,' the Bank said.
The June short sterling contract finished 4 basis points higher at 93.94 and
the September contract closed 7 basis points ahead at the same level.
The sterling cash market was more or less unmoved yesterday. Three-month
money ended unchanged at 6 1/16 per cent. The overnight rate dropped to
about 5 per cent but the market had some difficulty removing a tiny daily
shortage of Pounds 350m.
In Germany, the Bundesbank left its repo rate unchanged at 7.60 per cent,
compared to some expectations of a rise in the rate.
Short-dated Euromark contracts reflected this move. The June Euromark
contract rose 3 basis points on the day, closing at 92.88. Dealers
anticipated a cut of at least 25 basis points in the discount rate at
today's Bundesbank council meeting.
German call money also eased marginally, to 7.90 per cent, after the
Bundesbank added a net DM6.7bn at its weekly repo operation.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Dutch mount assault on manure
mountain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DUTCH government has reached agreement with the country's highly
productive livestock farmers on reducing pollution-causing manure surpluses
by the year 2000, averting the threat of forced cuts in the size of the
Dutch pig, cattle and poultry herds.
Under an accord reached last week after long and difficult negotiations, pig
and poultry producers will be required by 1995 to cut the amount of harmful
phosphorous in manure produced on their farms by 30 per cent compared with
with the level in 1986.
The government and farmers' organisations are confident that the phosphorus
reductions can be achieved entirely by changes in the diets of their pigs
and poultry, meaning that the actual number of animals does not need to be
reduced.
The Netherlands has 115m head of livestock, compared with human population
of 15m. Modern animal husbandry techniques have left the country with more
manure than can be safely absorbed by farmland, causing stubborn problems
such as air and water pollution.
A central element in the new system for controlling manure surpluses will be
a 'mineral ledger' to be kept by livestock farmers starting in 1995. The
ledgers will keep track of the amount of phosphorus and nitrogen arriving at
farms in the form of animal feed and artificial fertiliser, the amount
effectively absorbed by the animals and the amount left as residue in
manure.
From 1996, livestock farmers who exceed the mineral quotas will be subject
to a 'super levy' designed to discourage surplus manure production.
Pollution caused by excessive manure production will also be curbed by
stricter controls on the amount of manure that farmers can spread on their
land.
From 1995, farmers will be allowed only 150 kg of phosphorus a year to each
hectare of grassland, down from 175 kg at present. By the year 2000 the
phosphorus limit will gradually be cut to 65 kg a ha.
This is meant to encourage livestock farmers to deliver surplus manure to
processing plants for conversion into manure pellets destined for export
markets. Other options open to farmers are large-scale conversions of
existing barns and sheds to prevent the seepage of manure into the air and
waterways.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold price hits 23-month high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOLD market frothed up again yesterday and in late trading the dollar
price in London broke through another pychologically-important barrier to
close at Dollars 370.25 a troy ounce, its highest for 23 months.
Traders suggested the price was being driven up by the momentum of options
activity which created extreme volatility at key price levels. 'The higher
it goes, the higher it will go,' said one.
More investment fund money poured in yesterday, dealers said. 'There are too
many fund managers around the world with no gold in their portfolios and now
gold looks like being the best-performing asset in the second quarter (of
1993) they must get some,' said one observer. Another comments: 'Gold is on
the fringe of the financial markets and it is a market where serious money
goes a long way'.
Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain Securities, part of the Deutsche Bank
group, said chart watchers believed that once gold's price broke through
resistance at Dollars 371-Dollars 372 an ounce there was nothing much to
stop it going to Dollars 380 and then Dollars 400. 'It is difficult to find
anything that might stop it. We could see Dollars 425 much more quickly than
some people expect.'
He pointed out that two gold producers had announced they had unwound some
forward sales and more might follow. He estimated that producers had sold
forward 90 to 100 tonnes of gold at receivable prices below the present spot
price. If spot prices rose to between Dollars 380 and Dollars 400 an ounce,
forward sales totalling 300 to 400 tonnes would be in that situation.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: NZ apple growers hail Japanese
breakthrough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL

<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW ZEALAND apple growers are licking their lips at the prospect of becoming
the only foreign suppliers, apart from the Koreans, to bite into the
lucrative Japanese market.
Mr Jim Bolger, the prime minister, announced in Tokyo this last week that he
had been told by Japanese prime minister Mr Kiichi Miyazawa to expect the
ban to be lifted within a few weeks.
New Zealand has been pressing the Japanese to open their market for New
Zealand fruit for 20 years, and over the past year considerable progress has
been made on a protocol to cover trade in apples between the two countries.
Japanese growers have been battling against New Zealand access.
Many other countries, including the US and Australia have been pressing
Japan to relax its ban, but it is believed that New Zealand, having signed
the complex protocols agreed by both countries, has a considerable time
advantage over its rivals.
Under the agreement New Zealand will also import Japanese apples. The first
are not expected to be sent till early next year, but it is expected the
trade could reach 10,000 tonnes in five years.
Hitherto the Japanese have resisted imports of all apples, apart from Korea,
because of the perceived risk that the apples will carry the codlin moth
pest. Under the proposed joint venture scientists from both countries have
been working on testing procedures.
Brian Aitken, group general manager fresh fruit exports for the Apple and
Pear Board said that the agreement was a real breathrough into a market that
had been closed for many years. However he said he expected the trade would
initially be small, worth possibly NZDollars 5m in the first year.
He said that under the agreed protocol New Zealand would have to meet
stringent standards. Orchards sending fruit to Japan would have to be
isolated by a 500 metre 'zone', there would be strict fumigation
requirements and cool stores and packing plants would be strictly
controlled. 'We also have a lot to learn about the Japanese market.'
Mr Aitken said he expected other countries, including the USt and Australia
would now put pressure on the Japanese to open their market to them as well.
'However having pioneered this protocol, we won't be rushing to let our
rivals know all the details,' he said.
Mr Aitken said that New Zealand had just made another breakthrough by
signing a deal to supply 15,000 cases of apples to China. A similar deal had
also been signed with Mexico, another new market.

New York arabica COFFEE prices were sharply higher at midday on what traders
said was renewed speculative buying, stirred by news of declines in US
warehouse stocks. After Monday's close the Green Coffee Association said
total US stocks in April fell by 518,000 bags to 9.59m bags (60 kgs each).
New York's move helped London robusta prices to break through Dollars 900 a
tonne. New York raw SUGAR was broadly lower and on the defensive at midday
on what traders said was heavy technically induced commission house selling.
Analysts were at a loss for any fundamental reason for the move, which
followed Monday's three-year high of 13.26 cents a lb in the July contract.
COPPER staged a brief rally in the afternoon on the LME but the move was
showing signs of running out of steam by the end of kerb trading as the
bearish sentiment on fundamentals reasserted itself. Dealers said news of a
6.7 per cent rise in April US housing starts contributed to the firmer tone,
helping to spark some profit taking. However, the overall bearish mood was
strengthened by a rise of 4,425 tonnes in LME stocks to a nine-year high of
411,550 tonnes.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Green shoots appear on
Colombia's arid savannahs - A rice pasture experiment that is yielding
dramatic results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MADELEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FARMER looked bemused as he looked out on rice growing on flat savannah
land in eastern Colombia. 'It's too good to be true,' he said.
Crops are a rare sight in the infertile and acid soils of South America's
huge savannah lands, which cover almost half the continent's agricultural
area and are particularly extensive in Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela.
Although traditionally used for cattle ranching, the native savannah make
poor pasture.
But ten years of research at the International Centre for Tropical
Agriculture, in Cali, western Colombia has led to the development of a rice
variety that grows in savannah soils. This could open the way for a
substantial increase in both crop and livestock production on savannah
lands, one of the last areas in the world not exploited by farmers.
The centre's researchers now believe that the savannahs can sustain
rice-pasture farming and that crops can be grown for the first time on up to
240m hectares (600m ha) of savannah land - larger than the area of
sub-Saharan Africa under food crops.
'The savannahs represents most of the area in the world that can be expanded
for agriculture,' says scientist Mr Richard Thomas.
With rice-pasture agriculture, farmers plant their rice and pasture at the
same time. After preparing and fertilising the land, they plant the rice in
rows and scatter the pasture seeds, a mixture of improved grasses and
legumes. Farmers harvest the rice after three to four months and then graze
cattle on pasture.
'The legumes pull nitrogen from the air, thus acting as a free nitrogen
fertiliser,' explains Mr Thomas. He estimates that they effectively provide
between 40 and 80 kg of nitrogen per hectare a year.
For the first farmers in Colombia who tried the new system in 1992, results
were dramatic. In all, some 4,000 hectares of savannah were planted with the
improved grasses, legumes and rice. The unirrigated rice - adequate rainfall
makes irrigation unnecessary - yielded an average of 3.1 tonnes a hectare.
In turn the quality of the pasture has been improved both by the new grasses
and legumes and by the fertiliser that remains after producing rice; this
means that farmers are able to increase the numbers of cattle on their land.
Where they might have previously stocked one cow to every 10 ha, they can
now start to think in terms of two animals a hectare - a 20-fold increase.
The cattle also gain weight faster on rice-pasture land. Whereas farmers
previously waited two years before taking their cattle to market, the
centre's scientists are hopeful that they will now be able to sell within 15
or 16 months. Although there are large farms on the savannah lands, there
are also many smallholders with between 100 and 200 ha who make only a
meagre living on the poor soils. By changing to rice-pasture they can grow a
crop, which they have not done before, keep substantially more cattle and
make their farms profitable.
There are also environmental benefits. Many savannah pastures are
over-grazed and the system could help to recover these lands and help to
ensure they are farmed on a sustainable basis. Mr Thomas believes that it
could also be used in some Amazonian forest lands that have been badly
damaged by indiscriminate logging.
The centre's scientists stress that savannah soils are poor and that rice
should not be planted continuously - 'for no more than three or four years',
says agronomist Jose Ignatio Sanz. Farmers should then leave the land purely
for pasture for several years before growing rice again.
Nor should rice be planted on its own on savannah land. If the new rice
variety is grown in monocropping fashion on the savannahs, it may produce
well in the first year, but yields will be down to almost nothing by the
third.
'We want farmers to understand that the system is fragile,' says plant
breeder Mr Elcio Guimaraes.

A EUROPEAN Commission proposal to fix a 20 per cent rate for arable land
permanently taken out of production must be approved by farm ministers by
July 31, Commission officials said, Reuter reports from Brussels.
Officials hope this can be done at the next farm council on May 24, allowing
time to prepare for the implementation of the new rules.
Governments and farmers, notably Danish, favour permanent set-aside, which
is seen as simpler, easier to control, better for the environment and more
acceptable to taxpayers.
Ministers are expected to give guidelines rather than take quick decisions
on a commission paper, approved yesterday, discussing the controversial
set-aside scheme - a key element in last year's reforms to curb farm output.
The commission paper was drafted in response to criticism from member states
and farmer groups about the complexity of the scheme and desire to make it
more beneficial to the environment.
If farmers are allowed to combine permanent and rotational set-aside on the
same farm the higher 20 per cent rate should apply, according to the
commission paper.
Farmers must set aside 15 per cent of arable land under a six-year
rotational scheme adopted in last year's reforms.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nigeria signs deal with
BP-Statoil alliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NIGERIA YESTERDAY signed an oil exploration and production-sharing contract
with the alliance between BP and Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company,
for three deep offshore blocks south-west of the Niger Delta. It was the
third agreement in a month by a foreign oil group to take all the risks in
developing new fields since shortage of cash forced the government to stop
taking majority stakes in exploration joint ventures.
After initial resistance to the terms offered by Nigeria's ruling
transitional council this year, the foreign oil companies are falling into
line following last month's signing by Royal Dutch/Shell and Elf of France.
Exxon of the US is to sign a similar deal on Friday.
The contract marks the return of BP to active exploration in Nigeria after
an absence since 1979, when its Nigerian assets were nationalised. It was
welcomed by Mr Philip Asiodu, the oil minister, who said at the signing in
Lagos: 'We are all sorry that matters political led to a rupture'.
The structure is estimated to hold reserves of at least 250m barrels and
could have as much as 1bn barrels. BP-Statoil will pay a signature bonus of
USDollars 42m and are committed to investing a minimum of Dollars 65m over
the next six years. Seismic tests will begin this year and the first
discovery is expected by the end of 1994.
Mr Asiodu said that Nigerian law would be amended by August to allow more
favourable terms for the increased risk taken by foreign oil companies in
the new contracts.
For deep offshore exploration the petroleum profit tax will be cut to 50 per
cent, the investment tax credit will be 50 per cent and royalties to NNPC,
the state-owned petroleum corporation, will be on a sliding scale from 16
per cent to zero, according to depth. Similar amendments will be made to
terms for contracts covering onshore blocks.
The BP-Statoil alliance, established more than two and a half years ago,
expects to complete negotiations next year with authorities in Azerbaijan on
terms and conditions to develop the Chirakh oil field, according to the
chief executives of the respective companies, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
Speaking in Stavanger at a briefing on the alliance's development, Mr David
Simon of BP and Mr Harald Norvik of Statoil agreed that significant results
had been achieved by the two companies in a very short time but recognised
that its true test would be to bring production on stream with a resonable
return on investment in the various areas where it was operating.
Mr John Brown, BP vice-president of exploration and development, said the
Chirakh development could need investment amounting to 'several tens of
billions of kroner' but he would not be drawn on specific figures, which
could be sensitive in current negotiations.
The alliance believes the Chirakh field holds at least 1bn barrels of oil.
The two companies aim to bring it on stream by the end of 1997 with output
of about 200,000 barrels a day.
In March, the alliance delivered results of a development study for Chirakh
to Socar, the Azerbaijani state oil company, and also results of a study on
the prospects of exploring for oil and gas in the Shak Deniz area, in the
southern part of the Caspian Sea. Elsewhere in the South Caspian Sea, the
BP/Statoil alliance is participating in a licence operated by Amoco, which
has commenced negotiations on obtaining a production sharing agreement.
Next month it aims to bring on stream non-productive wells in western
Siberia that it has rehabilitated.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (12): Long catalogue of woes - Environmental
laws are to be strengthened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN WARN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHILE'S constitution enshrines the right to live in an environment 'free
from pollution.' That is probably little consolation to Santiago's 4.5m
citizens, who are forced, particularly in the winter months, to live under a
pall of choking fumes.
In spite of the fine words of the constitution, Chile suffers from an array
of intractable environmental problems resulting from its natural-resource
intensive economy, inadequate government controls and sprawling
urbanisation.
Only now is the yawning gap between the constitution and everyday reality
being addressed. In the autumn of 1992, the government of President Patricio
Aylwin submitted a package of legislation to Congress to strengthen and
extend the country's patchwork of environmental laws and decrees.
Companies would for the first time be required to undertake environmental
impact studies of new projects, and a start would be made on the formulation
of environmental standards. The absence of a viable regulatory framework
leaves complainants against polluters little option but to embark on often
lengthy court actions.
The battle against pollution is still in its early stages. 'The country as a
whole has not confronted the environment as an issue,' says Mr Juan
Escudero, head of the Santiago anti-pollution commission. 'Only in the past
five or six years has there been any kind of awakening to environmental
problems.'
The commission's efforts to tackle the specific problems of Santiago are
similarly at an early stage. Air pollution has been measured and the worst
sources of emissions identified, according to Mr Escudero. But the hard part
 -implementing a pollution-control plan for metropolitan Santiago - is only
just beginning.
Chile's capital is not helped by its geography and climate. Santiago is at
33 degrees south and is ringed by mountains up to 3,200 metres high. From
April to August (autumn and winter) thermal inversions trap the city's
pollutants, mainly particulates and carbon monoxide from vehicle exhausts.
Under the plentiful summer sunlight, the main problem is photochemical smog.
Buses, particularly old and badly maintained ones, are the main culprits,
and some successes have already been scored against Santiago's vocal and
powerful bus operators.
The government has sought to reduce the number of buses, which account for
over half of all journeys undertaken in Santiago, and cut duplication by
putting some routes out to tender. There are now formal contracts between
operators and the ministry of transport in what was formerly a completely
unregulated system.
Some 4,000 old buses have been taken out of service in the past three years,
and the total bus fleet has been reduced from 13,000 to under 11,000
vehicles - 'still too many,' sighs Mr Escudero. Private vehicles face
controls, too. Car use is restricted for much of the year in central
Santiago on a rotating basis, and since September 1992 all new private
vehicles have had to be fitted with catalytic converters.
The catalogue of Santiago's environmental woes goes on. The city produces 10
cubic metres of untreated waste water every second. While the city is
finishing its first water-treatment plant, at a cost of Dollars 12m, it will
take hundreds of millions of dollars and at least a decade to create an
effective system for the city as a whole. How many plants to build - and
where to build them - is still being studied.
Outside the capital, the country's natural resource based industries have
only recently begun to clean up their act.
The state-owned copper corporation Codelco, for example, is committed to
spending between 15 and 20 per cent of its investment budget - about Dollars
90m a year - on environmental controls.
But the pace of the industrial clean-up and the government's gradualist
approach to environmental regulation, aimed at minimising the impact on
growth, is rejected by an increasingly vocal lobby.
'Chile's macro-economic indicators are quite spectacular, but also
dangerous,' says environmental campaigner Mr Manfred Max-Neef. 'Another
eight years of the same will leave the country devastated,' he says.
Mr Max-Neef is running for president in December's elections as an
independent candidate backed by a 'rainbow coalition', including
environmentalist and women's groups, and trade unions. He does not seriously
expect to win the presidency but aims to push environmental issues up the
political agenda.
He lambasts the government for allowing the 'devastation' of Chile's natural
resources. At the southern port of Puerto Montt, 'there are mountains of
wood chips waiting to be sent to Japan to be made into toilet paper. I don't
think that's a very noble destiny for our native forests,' he says.
Chile's nascent environmental activists have already notched up some
successes, including a legal campaign by olive growers in the Huasco Valley
for more environmental controls at an iron pellet plant, which they claim
blighted their crops.
As if its internally generated environmental difficulties were not enough,
Chile faces an as-yet unquantified threat in the form of ozone depletion.
Every spring, Antarctica loses much of its ozone cover, as a result of
photochemical reaction with the greenhouse gases produced by the
industrialised world, exposing neighbouring countries to increasing levels
of cancer-causing ultraviolet rays.
The ozone hole is getting bigger, appearing earlier and lasting longer every
year. The implications for southern Chile could be enormous. Whereas the
government has at least started to take stock and act on Chile's more
conventional environmental dilemmas, understanding of the ozone problem is
only in the earliest stages.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (14): Modernised and export-oriented - The
wine industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN WARN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the main plaza of Curico, about 200km south of Santiago in Chile's
Central Valley, the festival to mark the start of the grape harvest is in
full swing. The local bishop has blessed the year's first pressings and a
wine fountain is flowing. The town band is earnestly tackling a vigorous
march and the queen of the harvest is about to receive her reward - her own
weight in wine.
Although the festival looks like time-honoured ritual it is in fact the
celebration of a very recent phenomenon - the emergence of a modernised,
export-oriented wine industry. A combination of foreign investment and a
renewed dynamism on the part of Chilean estate owners has translated into
soaring sales.
Exports grew 55 per cent last year to about Dollars 180m, according to the
Chilean wine industry association. This was the fourth year in succession in
which exports grew more than 50 per cent in dollar terms. Export volume last
year climbed 25 per cent to 80m litres and the association forecasts
overseas sales of 120m litres by 1995 and 180m litres by 2000.
Mr Miguel Torres, the Spanish winemaker, is the man widely credited with
sparking this revolution. Mr Torres first invested in Chile 14 years ago,
after a lengthy search for new opportunities in both California and Latin
America. 'I really think the Central Valley is paradise for anyone
interested in vines,' he says at his bodega outside Curico. 'The climate,
the quality of the soils and absence of phylloxera (the vine pest) make this
place just about perfect.'
Mr Torres introduced state-of-the-art wine-making technology, including the
latest presses, new French oak barrels to lend more character to red wines,
and cold fermentation tanks for the whites. In doing so he broke decisively
with the Chilean philosophy of 'quantity not quality.'
Other foreign investors have proved eager to follow his lead. Chateau Lafite
bought a 50 per cent stake in the historic vineyard of Los Vascos at the end
1988, with the aim, according to Lafite oenologist Mr Gilbert Rokvam, of
creating 'a French chateau in Chile in the tradition of the great Bordeaux
wines.' Another small family-owned business, Errazuriz Panquehue, formed a
joint venture with California's Franciscan Estates the same year.
Errazuriz has a dual strategy, according to Mr Eduardo Chadwick, whose
family have owned the business since 1870. On the one hand it is seeking to
produce high-quality Reserva wines at the family's three properties. But it
is also buying in grapes under long-term contract from farmers to produce
Caliterra, a more middle-market brand. 'Our biggest job was getting farmers
to prune back more to decrease yields and raise quality,' says Mr Chadwick.
Caliterra, launched three years ago, has become the biggest Chilean brand in
the UK market, Mr Chadwick says. The link-up with Franciscan proved
short-lived - the joint venture was dissolved amicably in 1991. Franciscan
moved on to a Dollars 6m investment in the Casablanca Valley between
Santiago and Valparaiso. The company remains the agent for Errazuriz in the
US.
The main market for Chile's wines continues to be the US, which accounted
for about a quarter of sales by value last year. Chilean wines make up 7 per
cent of US wine imports and it has overtaken Germany as the third-largest
wine exporter to the US after France and Italy.
Small vineyards such as Los Vascos, Torres and Errazuriz are at the cutting
edge of Chile's wine industry. But it is dominated by Vina Concha y Torro,
which accounts for about a quarter of wine exports, twice as much as its
nearest rival, Vina Santa Emiliana. The average price per litre these
winemakers command is low compared with smaller operators, but they also
produce top wines.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (13): Distinguished ancestry - Profile:
Senator Eduardo Frei
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN WARN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senator Eduardo Frei, leader of Chile's Christian Democrats and front-runner
in the race for the presidency, is not exactly known for his fiery oratory
or barnstorming campaign style. But at least, according to one political
analyst, 'he has learnt how to smile.'
A sombre, rather taciturn businessman, Mr Frei is consistently the country's
most popular politician in the opinion polls behind President Patricio
Aylwin. His position as leader of the biggest party in the ruling coalition
has given him a seemingly unbeatable hand against the divided opposition.
Despite a distinguished political ancestry - Eduardo Frei Senior was
president from 1964-70 - Mr Frei only ran for office for the first time in
1990, when he won his senate seat. However, he joined the Christian
Democrats in 1958 at the age of 16 and says he was always active in the
party.
Mr Frei denies charges that he trades on the reputation of his late father -
a popular and charismatic politician, and a founder figure of the Christian
Democrats. 'It's foolish to deny that people remember my father. But not all
sons of presidents follow in their fathers' footsteps. Ultimately people
will judge me by what I do, not by my name.' His father, he adds, gave him
'a vision of this country and of public service.'
A key element of Mr Frei's political credo is a determination to preserve
the ruling Concertacion coalition 'for as long as it is efficient and
rational to do so.' The Aylwin government, which effected the transition
from military to civilian rule, 'achieved high economic growth, political
stability and increased social spending. For me, that proves the value of
working together,' he says.
If elected president this December, Mr Frei promises to 'continue and
deepen' the reforms of the Aylwin administration. But he highlights poverty,
weaknesses in the education system and bottlenecks in infrastructure as
obstacles to continued growth.
Mr Frei is unequivocal about the need for constitutional reform to remove
the checks on the elected government handed down from the Pinochet era.
'This is a matter of principle for us. I don't know of any other democratic
country where the head of state or civil authorities don't have control over
the chiefs of the armed forces.'
The Senator may be well placed to succeed where the Aylwin government
faltered - a constitutional reform package failed to win the required
two-thirds majority in Congress this March.
'Frei has a strong sense of how power works in this country,' says Mr Oscar
Godoy, head of political science at the Roman Catholic University of Chile.
'He is no great orator - he knows that - but he is a good team player,
chooses his people well and he likes taking decisions.'
Mr Frei rarely departs from the language of gradualism and consensus. Even
the attempt by the Socialist party and its ally the PPD to offer their own
candidate, Mr Ricardo Lagos, for the coalition's presidential nomination is
'absolutely normal and unsurprising in a presidential system,' he says,
smiling.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (9): Sell-off date
approaches - UK parcels post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPRESS parcel companies are generally cautious about their future.
Most leading UK operators report a small improvement which they expect to
continue through the year. Others, however, are enjoying double-digit growth
but do not say whether they are discounting or from what base they calculate
their growth.
Rate cutting remains rife and there is still a lot of overcapacity. As
recovery develops overcapacity will shrink but some executives say that
there are still too many companies.
Parcelforce estimates 1992 sales of UK express services at Pounds l81bn of
which some 43 per cent is accounted for by next day services while other
guaranteed services command another 20 per cent.
Parcelforce itself has seen its next day volumes grow by 50 per cent during
1992-93.
There is much interest about the fate of the two public operators, Red Star
and Parcelforce. Red Star, which has made notable progress towards returning
to profitability, is expected to be sold by the late summer. The timing for
Parcelforce is less certain.
At Parcelforce, it is a case of 'business as usual', says Malcolm Kitchener,
managing director. 'Our overall strategy is geared to improving both cost
and quality in all areas of our business. This involves investment in new
depots such as Pounds 15m at Liverpool into new vehicles and other
technology such as in-cab communications systems. Restructuring is also part
of the programme with 50 depots due to be closed as part of a
rationalisation programme to save Pounds 16m a year.'
Red Star reports that business is flat and has been for four or five months.
However its budget for this year allows for some growth from the late summer
onwards. Of the two, Red Star is considered the more saleable and a more
manageable unit.
Reducing costs is one of the key ways in which operators are combating the
recession. TNT has rationalised its management and cut its use of
subcontractors to save some Pounds 6m a year in the UK. It is concentrating
on next day services and reducing two and three day operations which have
been losing money.
Tom Bell, TNT's UK general manager, says that 'order sizes are getting
smaller but being sent more frequently. The use of premium services has
fallen from more than 50 per cent to 42 per cent in 1992.' He forecasts
between two and four per cent growth this year.
'There is no shortage of volume in the market but it is extremely cost
conscious,' says Colin Millbanks, chief executive of Parceline. 'Cost is now
the main deciding factor with customers in choosing an operator. They are
much more prepared to trade off quality against price.'
Parceline had achieved a strong financial performance with borrowings down
and net profitability up,' adds Mlllbanks. Over the past two years the
company has invested some Pounds 2m in developing the parcel management
system building on its bar coded technology. Quality is being improved, with
BS5750 accreditation of the line-haul operation and its national hub being
pursued.
Investment in new technology has been one of Securicor Omega Express's key
policies through the recession. The company claims to be the UK's largest
overnight carrier with an estimated 15 per cent of the market. It has a
throughput of l6m parcels a week and employs 3,000 vehicles and more than
8,000 personnel through 154 branches.
Some companies have made considerable change in the UK during recession.
Lynx, NFC's parcel arm, decided to take the opportunity of Federal Express's
withdrawal from domestic operations in Europe to buy their hub at Nuneaton.
This has warranted a change from depot-to-depot trunking to a new hub-based
line haul network linking the 34 depots nationwide.
'We have improved hub efficiency by 50 per cent which has made a significant
difference to our operations,' comments Kevin Appleton, Lynx sales and
marketing director. 'We also installed a freight handling centre so we can
provide a full range of services from a Jiffy bag to a pallet.' Over the
past six months Lynx has won more than Pounds 6m of new business in the
automotive, pharmaceuticals and electronics sectors.
UPS, after much speculation, last July bought Carryfast, claimed to be the
UK's largest private package delivery company to be integrated in its UK
domestic operation. 'Integrating Carryfast has been undertaken gradually
since the purchase,' says Peter Quantrill, UPS's UK chief executive. This
integration involves merging Carryfast depots with UPS's International
depots where appropriate. To date four out of 15 have been integrated.
Quantrill comments: 'Our first quarter was up on 1992. Discounting is rife,
an inherent sign of the current market. It is encouraging to be ahead and we
will be looking for further growth through the year.'
The last 18 months have proved a particularly challenging time for Elan,
which was bought out of DHL in August 1991. The company has since moved from
losses into profit by concentrating on its speciality overnight service. It
offers delivery before 10am, 12 noon and 5pm as well as a palletised service
for shipments up to one tonne. It continues to progress well and won Pounds
3m of new business in the first quarter of 1993.
This encouraging growth in revenue comes on the back of record trading
volumes for Elan at the end of last year, says Brian Draper, Elan's managing
director. 'It more than justifies our recent Pounds 1m investment in new
trucks and our investment in IT systems.'
'Recovery has been filtering through since Christmas,' says Peter Gent,
Interlink's chief executive. 'There is improvement in volumes but not price.
There does not appear to be any pattern of recovery, or a pattern we can
follow, but we are moving about 5 per cent more than this time last year.'
A combination of cost control, better quality of customer service and
limited investment in enhancing existing technology systems has been adopted
by most operators to cope with the recession.
Few have introduced new services in the domestic market as their ranges were
satisfactory for most needs. Some trimming of depot networks has been
undertaken by some operators but trying to balance outgoings with revenue
has been the main challenge.
As the economy improves and trade expands the impact of rate cutting could
linger and keep revenue flows below what they should be. It is at this time
that some trimming of capacity might occur as quality of service to match
price as the key deciding factors on which operator to use.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (8): Into the big
time - Logistical services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMERY WORLDWIDE, one of the pioneers of international air express
operations, recently announced the formation of a new subsidiary to
spearhead its development of worldwide logistics services, writes PHILLIP
HASTINGS.
That business could eventually become its biggest revenue earner, says the
US-based company.
Together, those two points highlight both the most pronounced current trend
in the international express service industry and the reasons for it.
Basically, express companies which initially made their mark by offering a
set menu of fast, door-to-door delivery services, are now increasingly
focusing on the provision of custom-designed systems geared to meet the
often very specific requirements of modern logistics operations.
Manufacturers are developing JIT (Just In Time) logistics systems, for
example, like the ability of express companies to control the total
door-to-door movement of their goods but want services which precisely meet
their requirements.
Reflecting those trends, the world's 'big four' express companies - DHL,
TNT, Federal Express and United Parcel Service (UPS) - and leading
competitors such as Emery and Air Express International (AEI) are all now
stepping up their involvement in the broader international logistics sphere.
DHL, for example, is developing so-called Express Logistics Centres (ELCs)
in various key markets. TNT and Federal Express already have
well-established international logistics divisions, while UPS has set up
special logistics management teams all over the world and begun establishing
new bonded distribution centres.
Emery's new operation is called simply Global Logistics. Mr Roger Curry, the
company's president and chief executive officer, says the Emery name has
deliberately been left out of the organisation's identity to reflect the
intended broad scope of its activities, some of which will be outside the
company's traditional mainstream operations.
Global Logistics' services, he continues, will include warehousing both raw
materials and finished goods on behalf of customers, taking material into
inventory, maintaining computerised inventory records, updating the
customers' computer files, picking from inventory, packing and shipping, and
re-ordering when inventory gets too low.
Over the next two years, Mr Curry says value-added logistics services could
develop to contribute around 10 per cent of Emery's overall revenues. Longer
term, he expects that percentage to expand substantially. 'I think we will
in future see Emery earning more from that logistics-type activity than from
traditional freight services. That is definitely where the future is,' he
adds.
DHL appears to be thinking along similar lines. Having already broadened its
traditional courier image and activities to embrace packages and larger
consignments, the company is increasingly promoting its capabilities as a
general logistics service provider.
In that context, the company has now established ELCs in Brussels, Bahrain
and Singapore, plus a joint venture programme in Amsterdam. Other sites are
currently being evaluated.
Mr Patrick Lupo, Brussels-based chairman and chief executive officer for DHL
International, says it can take some time for companies to complete the
changeover to outsourcing their warehousing from suppliers like DHL. But, he
claims, companies which have gone that way, have been pleased with the
results.
'Our ELC here in Brussels, for instance, is proving particularly interesting
to non-EC entities which have a need to distribute products like high-tech
goods, medical instruments and oil industry analysis kits,' he adds.
Last year also saw the launch in the UK of a DHL business unit called
Interface. Basically, the idea is that Interface team members work closely
with specific customers on the development of their logistics operations.
UPS last year established its first bonded European distribution centre  - a
6,000 sq metre facility at Best near Eindhoven, the Netherlands - as the
forerunner in a series of such developments being planned by that company
throughout Europe over the next five years.
The idea is that overseas goods will be brought to Europe by ship or air and
held at the distribution centre in bond, under a Customs-approved licence.
There, UPS will provide a range of services including warehousing, inventory
management and order fulfilment, pick and pack, specialised labelling,
assembly and configuration, repair and return systems, and customisation of
products for individual markets. Once required in the end markets, goods
will be distributed throughout Europe using the UPS air and road network.
One of the main reasons for that sort of service development is explained by
Mr Tony Keating, the head of European logistics for UPS. 'More than 35 per
cent of the total potential package market UPS is interested in is in the
hands of the multinationals. Having established that, we decided we had to
do more about meeting the requirements of those customers,' he says.
Responding to similar demands, Federal Express Business Logistics Europe has
expanded its operations with the opening of a new logistics centre near
Eindhoven airport. The 5,200 sq metre complex, which is fully bonded, will
be developed as 'a strategic base for managing and running logistics
operations serving global markets as well as supporting other operations in
mainland Europe'.
One of the most significant recent worldwide logistics sector developments
by Federal Express involved a 'radical redesign' of the global logistics
process for US semiconductor manufacturer National Semiconductor
Corporation.
According to Federal Express, the new set-up will give National
Semiconductor a two business-day delivery to all its customers worldwide.
Previously, its delivery cycles for international customers had ranged from
five to 18 days.
While the trend for express companies to develop wider-ranging logistics
services is most pronounced in the international sphere, similar
developments are taking place in domestic markets.
TNT, for example, has a special contract logistics division in the UK
working for a range of clients in industries such as the automotive,
electronics and office equipment sectors. Federal Express BLS has a
specialised UK division called Systemcare to handle the home delivery of
furniture and electrical goods for companies such as Littlewoods and IKEA.
Other domestic express carriers are still concentrating primarily on their
established door-to-door delivery operations but are increasingly
introducing added-value services where they can or where customers demand
them.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (11): Coalition confounds its critics -
There is new political stability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT is a tribute to President Aylwin's ability to govern by consensus that
politics in Chile, once a matter of life and death, has become boring.
Seven months ahead of general elections, it is already a foregone conclusion
that the ruling Concertacion coalition of centre-left parties will form the
next government, and that Senator Eduardo Frei, leader of the Christian
Democrats, will become Chile's next president.
The key to the Concertacion's success has been its unity and discipline,
which have given Chile three years of stable government following the
transition from dictatorship to democracy in 1990.
The Concertacion confounded critics who believed the 17-party coalition
would unravel once its principal goal - to oust General Pinochet - had been
achieved. But according to Mr Edgardo Boeninger, President Aylwin's chief of
staff, the experience of government has given the Concertacion a 'shared
diagnosis and shared solutions that will make the coalition strong enough to
last one or two decades.'
'At this point in history,' Mr Boeninger continues, 'the parties of the
Concertacion need each other. The challenge will be to sustain this
consensus over time.'
The authority of the ruling coalition has been heightened by the total
disarray in the opposition camp, where two right-wing parties are locked in
a marriage of convenience, in a country where divorce is still illegal.
Even Mr Manuel Feliu, the presidential candidate of the main opposition
party, Renovacion Nacional, admits: 'The Chilean right today is shattered.
We are not an alternative for power. Our main task is to unite the right to
ensure it polls one-third of the votes, so that it can check the excesses of
the next government.'
Renovacion's spouse in this damage-limitation exercise is the Union of
Independent Democrats (UDI). UDI wants its own party leader, Mr Jovino
Novoa, to be the right's presidential candidate. The partners have yet to
have their big showdown on who will finally go forward.
Since the return of democracy, the two opposition groups have been locked in
a battle of supremacy for Chile's sizeable right-wing constituency. While
Renovacion's efforts to forge a modern conservative party along European
lines have foundered, through political infighting, UDI remains unashamedly
nostalgic for the days of authoritarian rule.
The right has also been robbed of political ammunition, because President
Aylwin's government successfully hijacked Gen Pinochet's economic model.
Nevertheless, the Concertacion and the opposition remain deeply divided over
the legacy of military rule. The government recently failed to pass a
package of constitutional reforms in Congress, because it lacked the
necessary two-thirds majority. Among other things, the reforms would have
restored the president's power to dismiss military commanders-in-chief, and
would have abolished the nine non-elected Senate seats that were filled with
Pinochet appointees before he relinquished power.
Although these issues lie at the heart of a fully-functioning democracy,
they are unlikely to figure prominently in electoral debates. To understand
why, it is necessary to remember that the Chilean military negotiated their
departure from power, and effectively dictated the ground rules of civilian
government.
This explains the Concertacion's acceptance of Gen Pinochet's unassailable
position at the helm of the army, why it turns a blind eye to the
surveillance activities of army spies, and why it has not pressed human
rights trials.
'The effects of the negotiated settlement will be around for at least
another 20 years,' says Mr Oscar Godoy, a political scientist at the
Catholic University in Santiago.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (8): 'Big bang' to widen options - Capital
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Chilean right is fond of portraying Mr Alejandro Foxley, the finance
minister, as a mere administrator of the fruits of General Pinochet's
economic miracle.
But before the end of the year, Mr Foxley hopes to have left his mark as an
innovator, with a new law aimed at implementing 'the deepest and most
complete reform to the domestic capital markets' since the early 1980s.
His 'big bang' will widen the investment options open to private pension
funds and insurance companies. Since Chile reformed its social security
system in 1981 - introducing a compulsory savings scheme, managed by private
companies known as Administradoras de Fondos de Pensiones (AFPs) - pension
funds have become the biggest institutional investors in Chile. They now
manage almost Dollars 13bn of funds, equivalent to one third of gross
domestic product.
The draft bill, sent to Congress in January, is long overdue. AFPs have been
complaining since the late 1980s of the dearth of investment options in
Chile, as they are accruing much faster than they are paying out benefits.
Under the proposed legislation, AFPs will be able to diversify their equity
portfolios and invest in new instruments, such as securitised bonds and
closed-end entrepreneurial development funds. The government hopes the
latter will be a source of long-term capital to small and medium-sized
businesses.
AFPs will be allowed to invest up to 10 per cent of their portfolios in
shares, corporate bonds and gilt-edged securities abroad.
Although AFPs were authorised to invest in a more restricted number of
foreign instruments last year, they have yet to dip their toes into the
international capital markets. They are adopting a cautious 'let's study all
the options' approach, much to the chagrin of the legions of foreign
investment bankers currently touting for business in Santiago.
Mr Foxley says the reforms are imperative, in order to spread risk and
ensure better long-term returns for Chile's 12-year-old private pension fund
system. Both the government and the pension fund managers expressed concern
last year over the growing concentration of AFP equity portfolios in a
limited number of privatised utilities. Almost half of these investments are
held in electricity and telephone companies, some of which performed poorly
in 1992 and depressed the overall returns on AFP investments.
The reforms have called on some elements of US trustee legislation to
introduce revenue bonds for the finance of large infrastructure projects.
Under this scheme, the money raised by bond issuers is managed by a trustee
who disburses funds as the project develops.
The finance ministry sees revenue bonds as an important vehicle for
substituting foreign finance for big projects, particularly now that the
country is pushing to upgrade roads, ports, irrigation, telecommunications
and power generation.
Insurance companies, which manage about Dollars 3bn of funds, will be
allowed to invest up to 15 per cent of their funds in foreign equity and
bonds and in the derivatives markets at home and abroad.
While the stock market and Chile's 19 AFPs broadly welcome the proposed
reforms, they are bitterly opposed to parts of the law that will tighten
regulation on the thorny question of insider trading and other potential
conflicts of interest. The controversy is bogging down discussions in the
Senate.
In essence, investment managers, be they mutual funds, AFPs, stockbrokers or
insurance companies, will be required the keep their own investments
separate from the portfolios of their clients - a rare practice to date and
a state of affairs that has caused Chile's securities watchdog many
headaches.
The second issue - the handling of 'privileged' or insider information  - is
a much trickier question, given the close-knit nature of Chile's small
business community. The government wants to oblige AFPs to appoint a certain
number of independent directors to their boards, men who have no financial
interest in the companies AFPs invest in. At present, it is quite common for
company directors to wear several hats at once.
'Even if the government succeeds in tightening regulations,' says Mr Mario
Lobo, an investment analyst in Santiago, 'loopholes will inevitably persist
until the business community itself accepts that the use of privileged
information is unfair practice.'
The proposed reforms have already galvanised the capital markets in Chile.
Santiago's stock exchange rallied by 16 per cent in January, when the bill
was sent to Congress. Trading was unusually heavy in second-tier stocks that
might soon become eligible for the enlarged portfolios of AFPs. Santiago has
also seen a spate of initial public offerings, which will give the stock
market more depth and liquidity.
Social security reforms elsewhere in Latin America, modelled broadly on the
Chilean AFP system, are also tempting Chilean pension fund management
companies to venture abroad. Six Chilean AFPs are setting up subsidiaries in
Peru, where private pension schemes were introduced this month. Another four
AFPs plan to establish themselves in Argentina.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (10): Pinochet's influence lingers on - The
politico-military relationship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They say that old soldiers never die. In General Pinochet's case, neither is
he prepared to fade away.
Chile's former dictator, now 77 and fitted with a pace-maker, granted
himself the constitutional right to head the army until 1998. He has not
expressed any wish to take early retirement.
Gen Pinochet has three main reasons for wanting to remain commander in chief
of the army: Rightly or wrongly, he regards himself as the guardian of
Chile's peaceful transition to democracy. He is the army's main insurance
policy against the threat of human rights trials. And, having modernised the
Chilean economy, the general still has one unfulfilled ambition: to go down
in history as the man who also modernised the largest and most cumbersome
branch of the Chilean armed forces.
For while the navy and air force effectively withdrew from government during
the last years of military rule, the army's best cadres were busy running
state bureaucracies and the ubiquitous security apparatus.
As a result, the 60,000-strong army (it includes 30,000 conscripts) finds
itself far behind its sister branches in preparing for the challenges of the
21st century. Pay is poor; the army has forged few links with military
academies abroad; and Gen Pinochet's intense dislike of the US has led to
logistical problems in the search for non-American arms suppliers.
President Aylwin's 'cohabitation' with the former dictator has not been
easy, but he has handled it with considerable skill and no small measure of
restraint. The president's boldest initiative was to commission an
independent report, published in March 1991, on the human rights abuses
committed during Gen Pinochet's rule. The report stopped short of naming
those responsible for the repression, but it provided moral reparation for
the victims and their families.
The army rejected the report's findings, frustrating President Aylwin's
efforts to heal the wounds of the past. Nevertheless, the government has not
pursued human rights trials. Only a handful of cases, which fall outside a
1978 self-amnesty decreed by the military, are being pursued through the
courts.
As the human rights legacy has diminished in importance, other issues
concerning the role of the military in a democracy have taken centre stage.
Spying on politicians caused a scandal last year which highlighted the
government's impotence in dealing with the army intelligence services; they
remain beyond civilian control.
Earlier this year the government failed to muster sufficient support in
congress for a constitutional amendment that would restore the president's
power to dismiss military commanders. The amendment was blocked by the
right-wing opposition. The government's defeat was yet another example of
how Gen Pinochet continues to exert an influence over domestic politics long
after relinquishing power to civilians.
Nevertheless, these public battles have obscured the extent to which
progress is being made in bridging the chasm of distrust that separates
civilians and men in uniform. This year, for the first time, 20 civilians
will be graduating with a master's degree in defence studies from the
Chilean War Academy. 'It has been an invaluable forum for discussion, to get
to know their way of thinking,' says Mr Hugo Espinoza, a left-wing
sociologist who was expelled from the military-controlled universities
during Gen Pinochet's rule.
Mr Espinoza also sees progress in the military's relations with congress.
'Their greatest fear was that politicians would meddle in military affairs,'
he explains.
After a tense first year, the armed forces now send their top brass to
parliamentary defence committees to explain and account for military
expenditures. The navy and air force have made a special point of inviting
senators and deputies on inspections and military manoeuvres.
Despite greater accountability, military expenditure remains high for a
country with no border conflicts. The military budget consumes 15 per cent
of the government's income - about 4.5 per cent of GDP. In per capita terms,
Chile has the highest military expenditure on the continent, excepting Cuba.
Few Chileans feel bold enough yet to question the cost of their armed
forces, let alone their efficiency. These troublesome issues have been left
for a future government to tackle. President Aylwin's main aim during this
transitional four-year government has been to establish a modus vivendi with
Chile's former masters.
Mr Aylwin now says he has grown accustomed to the general. The military, for
its part, has come to accept the legitimacy of democracy. No one in Chile
fears another military coup.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (9): Plain talk has won respect - Profile of
Alejandro Foxley, finance minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Alejandro Foxley, the Chilean finance minister, embodies the change in
economic thinking that has put Latin America on a new course of development
after the 'lost decade' of the 1980s.
Once a fierce critic of General Augusto Pinochet's free-market policies, Mr
Foxley came to accept the benefits of an open economy and a reduced role for
the state. He faced a difficult balancing act when he took over the finance
ministry in March 1990, on Chile's return to democracy.
The business community was nervous of the new government, a coalition of
Christian Democrats and Socialists. The political transition had also raised
expectations among the mass of Chile's poor and middle-classes, who had
suffered great hardship under military rule. 'Our main economic challenge
was also an ethical one: how to balance economic development with a greater
degree of social equality,' he says.
But Mr Foxley also had to prove that democratic governments in Latin America
could avoid populist traps and be responsible economic managers. His
leitmotif since assuming the finance portfolio has been to pursue a
'conservative fiscal policy with progressive ends.' One of Mr Foxley's first
acts was to push a tax package through the congress that raised corporate
taxes from 10 to 15 per cent, and the sales tax by two points, to 18 per
cent.
The extra Dollars 1bn in revenues was earmarked for social spending.
Pensions and family benefits were increased; state subsidies for low-cost
housing were extended; and teachers and health workers got more pay. In
spite of this, Mr Foxley faced a rash of public sector strikes in 1991.
He refused to bow to wage demands. He has been equally firm with Chile's
business leaders; he once told them to 'stop whining' when they complained
about high interest rates and the appreciating peso.
Mr Foxley's detractors accuse him of arrogance, and say he takes criticism
badly. But his plain talking has also won much respect for the 53-year-old
finance minister. He is acknowledged as a heavy-weight in President Patricio
Aylwin's cabinet. If the ruling coalition wins the December 1993 elections,
it will be largely as a result of the steady economic course charted by Mr
Foxley. He is tipped to become Chile's next foreign minister, but many of
his supporters believe he may want to make a bid for the leadership of the
Christian Democratic party, to launch his presidential candidacy in 1997.
An economist by training, with a doctorate from the University of Wisconsin
in the US, Mr Foxley cut his political teeth during General Pinochet's
dictatorship. Like most academics who advocated the restoration of
democracy, Mr Foxley was banned from teaching at state universities, and was
subjected to police harassment, isolation and censorship. His house was
broken into several times and death threats were left inside his passport.
Together with other banned academics, he founded Cieplan, an economic think
tank with Christian Democratic leanings. When General Pinochet gave way to
contested elections in 1989, Mr Foxley joined Mr Aylwin's presidential
campaign.
By then he was convinced that retaining the broad lines of the military's
economic policies was the key to a smooth political transition. He was
rewarded with the finance portfolio.
Mr Foxley is also earning a reputation abroad as a leading exponent of the
importance of free trade for developing countries. He chaired the IMF/World
Bank's development committee between 1990 and 1992, from which position he
reminded industrialised nations of the need to dismantle protectionist
barriers.
With much of Latin America betting on an export-led model of development, he
argues, access to foreign markets has become much more important than aid,
soft loans or debt-relief. 'The absence of further liberalisation in
industrialised nations means that middle-income countries like Chile are
losing a unique opportunity to expand their exports,' Mr Foxley says.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (5): Red tape and
sealing wax - Richard Evans tries to unravel the great UK parcels sell-off
mystery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE long term structure of the parcels industry remains unclear following
further delays by the government in reaching a decision on how to privatise
the Post Office and float off its Parcelforce division.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has yet to decide
whether to sell off the Post Office as one unit or break it up into three -
the Royal Mail, Post Office Counters, and Parcelforce. No clearly preferred
option has yet emerged.
Mr Edward Leigh, the trade and industry minister with direct responsibility
for the post office, is a strong supporter of privatisation, but he is
understood to have accepted that the measure might have to be delayed until
next year or beyond.
The sale of Parcelforce could still proceed without primary legislation,
though. Under the British Telecommunications Act, 1981, Mr Heseltine has the
power to sell Post Office subsidiaries, but he is thought unlikely to take a
decision on this part of the privatisation process until he has decided on
the overall form of the sale.
This caution comes as a great disappointment to the senior managers of
Parcelforce following Mr Heseltine's announcement last July that he intended
to privatise the post office division.
However, two weeks later, Mr Heseltine made a further announcement of a
fundamental review of the future status of the Post Office. The two have
been inextricably linked ever since and the future seems as unclear as ever.
Mr Heseltine said that financial support would be made available so that
management and employees could bid for Parcelforce, but private sector
groups have also expressed an interest.
Mr Malcolm Kitchener, managing director of Parcelforce, is philosophical
about the delay, although he would clearly like the uncertainty to end as
soon as possible. 'We have been in limbo and it has not been an ideal
situation. It is unsettling and it is harder to win new business when people
know there is a big decision in the offing,' he says.
Nevertheless, Parcelforce has held its own in the very difficult trading
climate created by the recession. It currently holds nearly 30 per cent of
the non-urgent market and about 25 per cent of the total market including
express services. This makes it the largest UK parcels delivery organisation
with an annual turnover in excess of Pounds 500m.
Considerable progress has been made in knocking the organisation into shape
for privatisation as, in contrast to the Royal Mail division, with its
monopoly in letters delivery, Parcelforce has made substantial losses in the
past.
It notched up a loss of Pounds 131m in the year to the end of March, 1991
but this was reduced the following year to Pounds 24m with a programme of
cost cutting, voluntary redundancies and the introduction of high-tech
equipment and support services. In the financial year just ended more
progress has been made with a reduction of costs of another Pounds 14m.
'It obviously gets harder all the time, but we will get there. What we need
to do is get on with our business plan as that is where further benefits
will come,' says Mr Kitchener. He joined Parcelforce from Fisons
pharmaceuticals division early in 1991 as finance director and became
managing director in August last year.
The business has taken great steps to distance itself from the Post Office
and the nationalised image it represents. It began with the setting up of a
separate parcels division within Royal Mail in 1986, the change of name to
Parcelforce in 1989, and finally the dropping of the Royal Mail prefix
entirely last year following success in establishing a separate identity.
Parcelforce makes commercially based payments to the Post Office for the use
of its services, such as access to Post Office Counters and delivery to
rural areas, and although it does not charge value added tax on its own
services, Parcelforce is in turn is unable to reclaim an estimated Pounds
12m a year for costs incurred on items such as petrol or overheads.
A five year Pounds 250m investment plan was launched last year to upgrade
the network of depots covering 23m UK addresses in the UK, the 10,000 strong
vehicles fleet, and information technology. It is investing Pounds 15m in a
high-tech sorting centre at Liverpool due to be fully operational next year.
'Our overall strategy is geared to improving both cost and quality in all
areas of our business,' says Mr Kitchener. 'We have invested in high-tech
equipment and have undertaken a restructuring and upgrading of all our
services to meet the growing demand for guaranteed next day delivery and
one-stop shopping.'
It is the guaranteed next day delivery that has been the weak link in
Parcelforce services until now. The organisation delivers over 180m parcels
a year, but mostly in the two or three day 'non-urgent' market, even though
around 95 per cent of customers come from the business sector.
Research shows there is a trend towards time-guaranteed services, and it is
estimated that next day services could soon account for over 40 per cent of
the market. It is this potentially more lucrative area, at present led by
Securicor, that Mr Kitchener is anxious to attack.
At present Parcelforce takes only a small slice of this sector, although
volume growth on its next day service increased by 50 per cent in 1992-93,
and so far this year it has secured Pounds 10m in extra revenue from its 24
hour express service.
It now offers a network of three time-guaranteed services, Parcelforce
Datapost, Parcelforce 24 and Parcelforce 48. These ensure delivery by 10am
or noon the next morning, close of business next day, or two days
respectively.
Mr Kitchener and his colleagues now await some form of privatisation with
impatience. They do not believe it would make a big difference to the way
the business is already conducted in a highly competitive environment, but
it would end the uncertainty and allow business plans to be fulfilled.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (7): Danger; nervy
computer on board - A mobile tracking system that boosts security and
reliability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE stuck in traffic behind a Securicor Datatrak van sees this warning
emblazoned on the doors. 'Securicor vehicles are fitted with Datatrak, an
automated vehicle tracking system. Should the vehicle be stolen, or
unlawfully removed, Securicor will track its precise movements, and will
pass that information to the police immediately.'
Securicor developed its Datatrak system to track these cash-in-transit vans,
to provide continuous automatic real time reporting of location and status.
Between 1988 and 1991 the system was extended to include two-way messaging.
Each vehicle has a small computer unit which receives signals from the
nationwide transmitter network.
The data gathered is then sent via a network of base stations and displayed
on a series of digital maps on a colour screen in the controller's office.
Users of the Datatrak service include police, ambulances and London
Transport.
The first independent courier operation to use the Securicor Datatrak system
was Link Couriers at Heathrow. Dick Temple, Link's founder and managing
director, says it helps to fulfil the two things which matter most to
courier clients, 'speed of response and some feedback on where the parcel is
and when it will be delivered'.
When Temple first set up in the courier business in Godalming in 1975,
communications technology was non-existent, or at least limited to using the
customer's telephone to report a delivery. But the 1980s saw great leaps in
the technology available: private mobile radio, online databases, even
barcoding for monitoring what arrived where and when. Now mobile data and
satellite communications are providing increasingly sophisticated systems.
In the last two years, large companies such as Securicor, Parceline and
Royal Mail have invested millions on information technology. Countrywide
networks have created the infrastructure for Automatic Vehicle Location. Now
smaller companies such as Link can benefit from some of that investment.
Temple says he has always been an enthusiast for any advances in
communications technology which enable his company to improve its service.
Link's fleet of 40 vans and motor cycles handles around 1,000 national and
local jobs a week from its Heston, Middlesex base. Temple has moved from
tone-only pagers in the 1970s into private mobile radio in the 1980s, and
for the last two years, the company has used Band 3 radio, enabling it to
take customers from a much wider area than the M25 corridor.
Temple sees Datatrak as a leap ahead of telephone and radio communications.
Each of Link's 20 vans now has an antenna and locator unit which enables the
controller to see the exact location of vehicles to within 50 metres'
accuracy, via a signal that is updated every 108 seconds. (Security
companies operate the more expensive eight-second option.)
The chief benefit is the efficient deployment of resources. 'In the early
days it was acceptable to collect within the hour,' says Temple. 'Now
customers expect 10 to 15 minutes. With this system we can use the closest
vehicle. It is also very impressive in giving accurate feedback to the
customer who is chasing a consignment on the phone.
'We can paint a picture for them - it's doing 60 mph on the A308, or just
about to pass junction X on the motorway.'
The console in the van includes a small printer and a keypad. The driver can
glance at a message as it is printed out and tap a number into the keypad in
acknowledgment. The response is pre-coded signifying, for example, whether
the van can accept another job or not.
'The next step', says Temple, 'is to have proper two-way messaging rather
than the one-way message and confirmation from the driver.' Another company,
Cognito, is already using two-way data terminals on its own network but
without Datatrak's location tracking facility which allows the controller to
pinpoint a van on a map.
The hardware in each van costs about Pounds 600, (the price has dropped from
Pounds 1,400 two years ago) with radio charges at about Pounds 15 per week
per vehicle. The controller uses a Compaq connected to the network, costing
about Pounds 5,000, and the 20-inch screen used for the map display is an
Eizo monitor, costing another Pounds 3,000. Link estimates the system costs
it around Pounds 1,000 per year per van, an expense it can easily justify.
Link drivers are paid on performance, (commission per completed delivery),
not on hours worked, so they are happy to use the system, and find it needs
the minimum of training.
It is for the user to decide what level of detail is recorded for any one
job. For example, Datatrak could solve the problem of policing a large fleet
(100 vehicles or more), which might lose a great deal of money if the
employees used the vans privately, or claimed unjustified overtime.
Temple is well aware of Datatrak's potential for policing and control, but
that's not what interests him. 'It's a service benefit. The customer notices
the difference because we are able to give realistic collection times. We
would build a margin into our estimates previously, but now we can say with
confidence that we can be there in 10 minutes.'
He knows that Datatrak might in time be overtaken by satellite systems, but
feels he has picked the right technology for the moment, especially if
delivering in urban areas where radio reception can be patchy. He believes
that new advances may include voice/data lines, and yet smaller onboard
computers, the size of a portable CD system, or even, eventually, a watch.
Currently his main concern is integrating his Datatrak system with software
bought from Marlow-based Fleetway, which manages booking and charging
automatically.
Fleetway provides modular software for administration and online booking,
for courier, taxi, delivery and other transport companies. According to
Keith Fellowes, group sales manager, Fleetway has 250 users in the UK, and
4,000 worldwide. 'Currently we work with both Cognito and Datatrak. This
gives users seamless integration making voice-radio contact unnecessary.'
Fleetway can use any existing messaging system, but currently finds these
two provide the best result. Becky Clark, technical director, sees a largely
unexploited market among smaller courier and delivery companies, who, as
hardware costs spiral down, can afford to emulate larger companies with
online systems. 'I reckon that there are at least 8,000 potential customers
out there in the UK alone,' she says.
Mark Attwood, of Manchester Publishing Company, describes the industry as
'paranoid' in the 1980s: 'They never talked to one another.' His newly
launched magazine, Courier Express, has a deliberately high IT content,
looking at future trends such as mobile data. 'The people who have invested
in technology early can point to success.' He cites two companies as proof:
Link Couriers, and Dale Express, a fast-growing Croydon-based company with
an unusual 'one-consignment per van' operation, which is administered by
custom-built software from Fleetway.
'IT should be the key to growth in the future,' concludes Attwood.' I
believe it's an investment in increasing service levels, and research shows
that's an issue that rates above cost for most customers.'

FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (6): Meaner and
fitter after the recession - After a heavy battering, the surviving
wholesalers show they still have a role to play
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PREDICTIONS that the expanding global networks of leading express companies
and activities by airlines would squeeze out independent wholesalers are
proving wide of the mark.
There were a number of significant casualties in the wholesale sector in the
late 1980s but surviving wholesalers are now generally expanding.
In line with the overall trend towards greater co-operation in the express
and air transport industries, they are increasingly developing partnerships
with airlines to sustain that expansion.
Mr Larry Woelk, managing director of John Menzies Group wholesale express
company Menzies Worldwide Distribution (MWD), believes that sort of
co-operation is the way ahead for independent wholesalers during the 1990s.
'Airlines are increasingly looking to focus on their core business - flying
aircraft. An airline can do a deal with us and because we are a wholesaler,
we can service the entire agent community,' he claims.
Wholesalers work on behalf of a wide range of freight industry companies -
from traditional forwarders with a requirement for someone to handle their
more urgent package traffic to established courier/express operators seeking
a neutral organisation to cover routes where they lack the traffic volumes
or presence to handle everything themselves.
Wholesalers tend to fall into one of two categories. The first involves
independent companies like MWD which specialise in that particular business.
Another is International Bonded Couriers (IBC), a US-based company with a
European office in London which specialises in handling traffic for Latin
America. The second group involves operations developed by some of the
larger international airlines.
British Airways, for instance, has an organisation called Speedbird Courier
which has built up a worldwide network of wholesale courier services.
British Midland operates similar services within Europe and also has a
separate wholesale division for worldwide shipments called International
Cargo Marketing. Air France recently consolidated all its express products
under one generic name - Air France Express - to highlight its renewed focus
on wholesale operations.
It was that sort of involvement by leading airlines which led to suggestions
that the days of the independent wholesale express company might be
numbered.
However, many airlines have struggled to develop successful express
operations and there is a pronounced trend for many to work with outside
wholesalers.
For example, the three-year-old wholesale courier/express company Bridges
Worldwide already has close links with a number of leading longhaul
airlines. The company initially launched services between London, Singapore
and Sydney with Singapore Airlines and is now UK agent for that airline's
courier products.
Bridges also works with South African Airways for services into Southern
Africa, Gulf Air for the Middle East Gulf and Virgin Atlantic Airways for
the US and Tokyo, Japan markets.
In the case of Virgin, Bridges is the airline's general handling agent for
express products worldwide.
'We work very closely with Virgin and we help them to develop their express
products,' comments Mr Gary Kendall, general manager for Bridges Worldwide.
'All the airlines we work with can take advantage of our worldwide network -
for example, we get traffic coming in from India on one carrier which is
then transferred on to Virgin flights for onward movement to the US.'
Meanwhile, US carrier United Airlines has over the last year developed a
wholesale airport-to-door service between the UK and the US in conjunction
with MWD. Similar services are now being developed out of Spain, Belgium and
France. MWD says it is also talking to 'a couple of other international
airlines' about developments similar to its partnership with the US carrier.
Within Europe, the advent of the EC single market is expected to boost
regional air courier wholesale operations. Specifically, the business should
benefit from a reduced need for on-board couriers to accompany shipments and
lodge documentation with Customs authorities.
Mr John Wilson, marketing manager express products for British Airways World
Cargo, pointed out that up to the beginning of this year, the carrier's
Speedbird organisation used couriers for all European services. Now, he
says, it is beginning to dispense with them on some routes out of London,
starting with those to Germany and Belgium, and is also planning to increase
the frequency of services.
Apart from London, the only other UK airport with international Speedbird
Courier services at present is Birmingham which has routes to Milan and
Brussels. 'In future, we will be looking to open up direct services from
places like Glasgow and Manchester to the Continent and also, further down
the road, to start bringing in Continental regional airports,' he added.
British Midland is taking a similar path. The airline has already dispensed
with on-board couriers for its wholesale services between London and Dublin,
Frankfurt, Brussels, Amsterdam and Paris. It is launching new direct courier
services between points such as Belfast and Amsterdam, Glasgow and Paris and
Birmingham and Brussels.
'This month we are also introducing a new product, a sameday priority
wholesale courier service from UK regional points like Glasgow, Edinburgh,
Belfast, Teesside and Birmingham to the Continental centres we cover, via a
transfer at London Heathrow,' British Midland added.
However, some general European wholesale courier/express service development
is still being slowed down by continuing differences in the way individual
EC Customs authorities treat courier shipments. The UK Customs, for example,
now allow airlines to send EC-bound courier traffic without an on-board
courier, as are their counterparts in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.
Customs in France and Italy, though, are currently not prepared to make that
concession for services which carry worldwide shipments in transit as well
as items moving solely within the EC.
'If you take our London-Frankfurt route, for example, that carries both
UK-originating traffic and also traffic which has originated in New York and
been transshipped in London for onward movement to Germany,' pointed out Mr
Wilson. 'So for the moment, we are going to have to retain on-board couriers
on certain flights to cater for that international traffic.'
On-board courier service customers hoping that the reduced need for someone
personally to accompany EC traffic will cut costs are also likely to be
disappointed. Any savings on costs through not using couriers will be
counter-balanced by additional ground-handling service and systems costs,
warn wholesale courier service operators.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (6): Welcoming magnet for multinationals -
Mining plays a crucial role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enormous mineral resources, a welcoming foreign investment regime and sound
macroeconomic fundamentals have transformed Chile into a magnet for mining
multinationals.
The foreign companies flocking to Chile reads like a Who's Who of the mining
world: Anglo-American, Bema Gold, BHP, Chevron, Cominco - and all the way
down the alphabet to RTZ and Shell/Billiton. The Chilean Copper Commission,
Cochilco, estimates that Dollars 5bn worth of investment will be channelled
into the mining sector to explore, develop or expand projects.
Nowhere else in the world are there so many projects so close to fruition.
Chile is the world's leading copper producer: about Dollars 4bn of this
foreign investment is being channelled into new copper mines. The country
has one-quarter of the world's known copper reserves.
Some Dollars 560m in gold projects will move Chile up the ladder of the
world's top 10 gold producers. A further Dollars 405m is being invested in
non-metallics such as iodine and nitrates.
Chile's mining sector plays a crucial role in its economy, accounting for
almost half of exports and 15 per cent of GDP. According to some estimates,
mining production will increase more than 50 per cent by the year 2000. High
ore grades at new mines mean that Chile will also continue to be one of the
world's lowest cost producers. One estimate by Cochilco puts copper
production rising from 1.94m tonnes last year to 2.18m tonnes in 1994.
The mining boom has been several years in the making. General Pinochet, who
ruled Chile between 1973 and 1990, wooed back mining multinationals with a
liberal foreign investment regime and a mining code which grants property
rights over mining concessions. The return of democracy in 1990 did not
upset this vigorous activity, as the new government decided to keep the
mining and investment codes intact.
More than half of Chile's copper is mined by Codelco, the state-owned
Chilean Copper Corporation. But Codelco's four mines, including
Chuquicamata, the world's largest, are old. Production is in decline,
operating costs are rising, and the powerful Copper Workers' Union, with
19,000 members, has blocked management plans to reduce overmanning.
Nevertheless, Codelco has a plan to reverse its dwindling fortunes.
Voluntary redundancies and a crackdown on absenteeism increased labour
productivity by 6 per cent last year, according to Mr Jorge Bande, Codelco's
vice-president for development. The state concern has also launched an
exploration drive to find new reserves.
An important breakthrough for Codelco came with the approval of a new law in
1992, authorising the state company to form joint ventures with the private
sector. Earlier this year, Codelco invited 20 mining companies to bid for
the exploration rights to four of its mining prospects. The idea, says Mr
Bande, is to allow Codelco to share the risk of exploration. He expects the
first joint-venture agreements to be concluded about the middle of the year.
Codelco owns one-third of the registered mining property in Chile.
Investment, however, has been limited by budget constraints dictated by the
finance ministry. Mr Bande sees the joint ventures as a way of tapping the
huge mineral potential that Codelco is unable to develop on its own.
In addition, Codelco has completed the basic engineering for Radomiro Tomic,
a huge ore body discovered near Chuquicamata. The new mine is scheduled to
enter production in 1995. Radomiro Tomic will be a test case for the
state-owned copper company. It is the first mine that Codelco is developing
from scratch, and the challenge will be to produce copper as cheaply and
efficiently as the private sector.
Mr Bande says Codelco is in the process of getting the final financial
approval for Radomiro Tomic, which will require an investment of Dollars
450m. Once it is up and running, the mine will add 150,000 tonnes of copper
to the 1.15m tonnes produced by Codelco's other divisions.
Most of Chile's increased copper output, however, will come from private
sector projects. Leading the wave of foreign investment, La Escondida - the
richest copper deposit in the world - entered production in December 1990.
La Escondida is jointly owned by BHP of Australia, RTZ and a consortium of
Japanese smelters led by Mitsubishi. The Dollars 900m project was completed
six months ahead of schedule - a tribute to the engineering and
organisational skills of the mainly Chilean contractors.
The mine, located in the Atacama desert, last year exported about 760,000
tonnes of copper concentrates (a semi-refined product equivalent to about
320,000 tonnes of refines copper), making it the second-biggest copper
operation in the world. The company is studying plans to increase production
by a further 80,000 tonnes - the output of a medium-sized mine - by 1994. It
is testing a method to process the extra tonnage into pure copper cathodes,
using a new technique which does not require smelting.
Exxon Minerals, of the US, is close to completing a Dollars 400m expansion
programme at its Los Bronces copper mine which will double production to
200,000 tonnes a year.
Cominco of Canada recently wrapped up the Dollars 250m financing to develop
its Quebrada Blanca copper deposit in the Atacama desert. It expects the
mine will enter into production in 1994 with an output of 75,000 tonnes a
year.
Phelps Dodge of the US is expanding its Ojos del Salado mine and plans to
develop a deposit known as La Candelaria, already being dubbed Chile's new
Escondida.
Outokumpu of Finland recently sold half of its Zaldivar copper deposit to
Placer Dome for Dollars 100m. The Canadian resources group also agreed to
finance up to Dollars 400m towards the cost of development.
Minorco, an investment company owned by Anglo-American of South Africa, paid
the record price to enter a copper project last year. Minorco shelled out
Dollars 190m to buy Chevron's (the US oil group) stake in Collahuasi, a
copper deposit high up in the Andes, now owned in equal shares by Minorco,
Royal Dutch/Shell and Falconbridge. Minorco estimates Collahuasi's start-up
date will be 1996-97.
The huge sums being paid by multinationals for a share of Chile's mining
bonanza reflects the country's growing reputation as a safe-haven for
foreign investment. 'The risk factor is not there,' says one diplomat in
Santiago. 'Companies are prepared to pay top dollars for good mining
projects.'
A comparative example: in Peru, Anglo-American's Chilean subsidiary Mantos
Blancos recently acquired the rich Quellaveco copper deposit from
state-owned MineroPeru for Dollars 12m. The huge price differential between
Quellaveco and Collahuasi, for roughly the same amount of copper reserves,
reflects the penalty Peru is still paying for its political instability.
The wealth of mining projects, concentrated mainly in Chile's desert north,
is putting a strain on the country's underdeveloped infrastructure. Finding
water in the driest desert in the world is as much a priority as striking a
rich mineral deposit. Electricity is also in short supply. Port facilities
are deficient.
La Escondida chose to build its own port, rather than compete with Codelco
for Antofagasta's overstretched docks. Phelps Dodge, which wants to ship La
Candelaria's copper concentrates from the small port of Caldera, is
encountering opposition from local fishermen. They fear the loading
operation will pollute the bay.
Environmental awareness is growing in Chile, and the clash between Phelps
Dodge and the fishermen of Caldera is by no means an isolated example.
Local farming and fishing communities have recently won important legal
victories against the polluting activities of mining operations. The
government has begun enforcing stricter air and water pollution controls.
Several companies, including Codelco, are now investing millions of dollars
to clean up their act.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (7): World glut hits kiwi-growers - The
reasons for the fall in fruit exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN WARN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OUTLOOK for Chilean fruit exports has become less sunny after a decade
of spectacular growth. Rising protectionist sentiment and the emergence of
new competitors have combined with last year's strong peso and lower
international prices to place unaccustomed pressures on the industry.
The European Community has moved to curb imports of apples following a good
growing season. In addition, tumbling prices for kiwi-fruit, due to a
worldwide glut, have hit Chilean growers hard. Fruit exports, which
constitute about a tenth of Chile's exports, slipped 2.3 per cent to Dollars
938m in the first 11 months of last year, according to the Central Bank.
By volume, fruit exports from September 1992 to March 18 this year grew a
modest 2 per cent, compared with the same period of the previous season,
according to the Chilean Exporters Association. Shipments to the EC fell
10.1 per cent, hit by the introduction of a licensing system in February
aimed at protecting European apple growers.
While the problems over apples may prove a short-lived result of the good
European season, the difficulties of Chile's kiwi-fruit growers are more
intractable. 'The market cannot consume all the kiwi-fruit being produced.
This is now a world problem,' says Mr Ricardo Ariztia, president of the
Federation of Chilean Fruit Producers (Fedefruta).
Of the major producers - Chile, New Zealand, Italy and the US - one country
will lose out heavily, according to Mr Ariztia. 'New Zealand and Chile is
the big commercial fight. Some of our kiwi growers will undoubtedly go out
of business,' he says. Chile has planted about 12,000 hectares with kiwis.
South Africa's re-emergence in international markets has added to these
woes. The country shares the same growing season as Chile, as do emerging
competitors elsewhere in Latin America, such as Argentina and Brazil. 'Last
year we lost out in the German market competing against South African
fruit,' says Mr Ariztia.
He cites South Africa's high quality control and standardised packaging as
posing the biggest threat to Chilean growers.
Argentina, according to Mr Armen Kouyoumdjian, an independent economic
consultant, 'is a sleeping giant. When it gets its act together it could
compete very effectively against Chilean fruitgrowers.'
These challenges take place against a background of continuing tensions
between Chile's exporters - dominated by multinational companies - and the
growers, often small, under-capitalised operators. The biggest bone of
contention is the 'free consignment' market system, under which growers hand
over their produce to the exporters, not knowing what price they will
eventually get after the fruit is sold on.
'We believe the final price we receive can be improved,' says Mr Ariztia.
Some growers have started to export direct, so far with very modest amounts
of fruit, to circumvent the exporter companies. In turn, the multinationals
have been buying agricultural land themselves in a bid to integrate their
operations.
Yet, in the face of these internal tensions and mounting external
compeition, the mood in the industry remains optimistic, if concerned. 'The
market for Chilean fruit is not saturated,' says Mr Ronald Bown, president
of the Chilean Exporters Association. 'This is a special year and we expect
to overcome many of the problems that are facing us.'
Both growers and exporters are seeking to move to a mandatory system of
quality control and to standardise packaging and box sizes. Almost all
Chile's major fruit export companies have their own quality certification
units. About 70 per cent of exports are self-inspected with only the
remainder looked at by third parties.
'We must work very fast on these issues. But I hope we can reach agreement
on mandatory quality control and packaging standardisation with the
exporters by next season,' says Mr Ariztia.
The industry is also boosting its promotional activities. The exporters have
earmarked Dollars 3m for promotion in Europe in 1994, and are working on a
long-term marketing plan for the US. 'The EC and the US are still the most
promising markets for us and will probably remain so for around the next 10
years,' says Mr Bown.
Fruit and vegetable exports to Latin America soared 48 per cent in the
growing season to mid-March, from an admitedly low base, helped by a
free-trade agreement with Mexico. A similar agreement with Venezuela at the
beginning of April and a planned deal with Colombia should also help develop
this market.
Longer term, Chile is hoping for great things from Asia. The exporters
association is looking for a way into the coveted Japanese market, with its
strict quarantine rules against agricultural imports, and expects to enter
the Korean market in the next four to five years.
'We have to work with imagination and intelligence - exporters, growers and
government together,' says Mr Ariztia. 'The industry is not going to grow at
10 per cent a year any more, but we still have a big contribution to make to
this country.'

FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (4): The bidders are
gathering - British Rail sell-off will start with disposal of Red Star
parcels business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY late summer the Red Star express parcels business will be under new
ownership. The information memorandum giving potential purchasers a
comprehensive commercial and operational insight into the business is
expected to be available by the end of May.
Once available the sale will be advertised inviting bids for the business.
'We expect there to be a great deal of interest in the sale,' says Dr Glyn
Williams, managing director of the BR Parcels Group. 'l cannot divulge the
number of companies who have so far expressed interest but it is likely to
be between one dozen and three dozen.'
All companies applying for the memorandum will have to sign a confidentially
agreement as it will contain sensitive commercial information. Few companies
have yet declared a firm interest although press reports suggest that a
number of the leading road-based operators will apply for the memorandum.
One definite is a management buy-out team including six existing Red Star
managers.
Because Rod Star does not run trains the sale does not require any enabling
legislation as is the case with the privatisation of other parts of BR. Once
the memorandum is issued the sale process is expected to be fairly quick.
The present management team has basically over the past year or so been
making Red Star a leaner and fitter organisation to increase its
productivity and competitiveness. The emphasis of these changes has been on
rationalisation, service improvements and increasing quality to the
customer.
Previously comprising four divisions, the BR Parcel Group has been reduced
to two: Red Star and the Rail Express Systems. The latter handles the Pounds
40m a year contract with Royal Mail.
Red Star previously consisted of domestic and international businesses. The
unprofitable international traffic was chopped with the exception of some
parcel traffic into Europe and a successful business to Ireland. These are
now merged in with the domestic business.
Track 29, a division operating a palletised service for heavier parcels was
sold to the road agents which handled the collection and delivery last
September because it was not making money and needed considerable
investment.
'We managed to reduce our losses by massive productivity deals and we have
looked very hard at every penny we spend,' explains Dr Williams. This
involve the loss of some 300 jobs through the last financial year to the
present 1,300 and also the number of parcel outlets has been steadily
reduced over the past two years from 500 down to a core 250.
These steps have considerably improved the Parcel Group's financial
performance. In the 1992/93 fiscal year to the end of March, turnover
amounted to Pounds 47m. In that year 'we substantially reduced the losses
incurred by Red Star which for 1991/92 which are more or less on record at
being Pounds 11m,' commented Dr Williams.
'I am not able to tell you the losses in 1992/93 but I can say that they
were roughly half at those in 1991/92, so we are making very considerable
progress.' The exact figures will be in the sale memorandum.
'This has been achieve through very substantial cost
reduction,' explains Dr Williams. 'We have suffered like our competitors and
the total market has gone over the last three years because of the recession
and we are suffering although our market research does indicate that we are
not suffering any more than anyone else. We have managed to maintain our
market share of about eight per cent through the recession.
'We have had declining revenues but in the last four or five months it has
been fairly flat but l cannot talk about green shoots yet,' observes Dr
Williams. He is hopeful that as the economy picks up, so Red Star's business
will improve. 'A one per cent improvement in the economy brings a much more
than one per cent improvement in our business', he adds.
Red Star's key advantage over its competitors is its same-day business, be
it door-to-door or station-to-station. Dr Williams describes it
enthusiastically as 'being marvellous, really really good.'
Its next day services provide door-to-door options of delivery before 9am,
before 10.30am and before 12 noon. There is also a next day
station-to-station option. The next day services account for the largest
proportion of Red Star's business but same day is the premium traffic, which
probably represents a major attraction to potential purchasers.
As part of preparing Red Star for the sale a train space agreement is
currently being negotiated with BR to ensure the new owners access to
trains, especially InterCity, the cost of access to platforms and to put
into longer term tenancy agreements the already existing annual agreements
for renting the shops which serve as Parcel Points.
Recession has meant that customers have traded down, moving from same-day to
next-day services. In a move to combat this from last October, Red Star
introduced completely revised charges which included substantial reductions;
increased its sales and marketing activities and introduced a completely
redesigned range of corporate and sales literature. The number of area
managers was reduced from 26 to Il and administration streamlined.
As part of the cost cutting review the operation of some 65 road agents
handling all Red Star's collection and delivery operations and accounting
for 20 per cent of all costs, was reviewed. To improve quality to customers
Red Star is working through BS5750 with accreditation due in July for all
its sites. This is part of Red Star's total quality management programmes.
Further productivity gains could be achieved if investment was made in
technology to enhance its existing systems but there is a hold on such
expenditure until after the sale. 'We would like to spend several million
pounds on improving our current technology which would make our operations
cheaper to run and on which the payback is excellent', says Dr Williams.
There would also be more job cuts.
Two new Parcel Points have been opened this year in Brentwood and Glasgow
where business justifies them. Delegation of responsibility down the
management lines has also resulted in a number of local initiatives taking
advantage of niche opportunities to boost business. 'This includes a courier
service in Glasgow city centre. For the future Red Star has been talking
with BR's European Passenger Services about operating express parcel
services using Channel Tunnel train services. There will be a limited space
available but same day options at a three hour service from London to Paris
or Brussels could open up a whole new business area. EPS will be marketing
this space to all operators interested in using it so there will be no
exclusivity.
What it does highlight is the emergence of high speed rail services as a
growing alternative to air and road based express carriers. With the high
speed passenger network developing year by year, the range of rail-based
services could develop considerably.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (2): The whole
world's in their hands - Shippers have global aims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MULTINATIONAL manufacturers and suppliers are increasingly demanding express
services which can distribute their goods worldwide with a standard level of
delivery performance.
Fuelling that demand is the now well-established trend for manufacturers to
reduce stocks or inventories and produce goods much closer to order.
Confirming those points, a recent World Bank survey of 1,000 global shippers
showed companies expected their frequency of annual inventory turnover to
rise 60 per cent between in the 10 years to 1996. Order cycle times were
expected to drop 40 per cent over the same period, with certain sectors of
industry showing even greater changes.
Some electronics companies, for example, have already reduced their average
order cycle time from 23 weeks to five weeks over the last 10 years. By
1995, the average order cycle time for the industry is forecast to be down
to less than two weeks. Such dramatic changes have important implications
for the international express industry.
'As global shippers reduce their inventories and turn those inventories more
frequently, they also demand shorter order fulfilment times from their
suppliers and quicker delivery commitments from their transportation
companies,' commented Mr Charles Malone, Federal Express vice-president
sales in Hong Kong at last month's Air Freight Asia '93 conference in
Sapporo, Japan.
The problem for the express companies and their competitors is that in order
to meet those demands properly, they need global service networks.
Developing that coverage is so costly that only a small number of operators
can genuinely claim to run worldwide delivery networks. Even those companies
are now in many cases increasingly developing alliances and partnerships to
help sustain such operations.
In line with that trend, Mr John Mullen, chief executive officer of TNT
Express Worldwide, believes that in spite of the recent relative calm in the
world express industry after a spate of joint ventures and amalgamations,
further changes are in the pipeline.
'Rationalisation is by no means over yet. I believe there will be a number
of changes on a global scale. There will be more capacity-sharing and better
utilisation of assets in the industry, particularly on a regional basis,' he
says.
TNT itself provides a good example of those trends in action, having formed
a joint venture international express company with GD Net, an organisation
established by the post offices of Germany, France, the Netherlands, Sweden
and Canada, some 18 months ago.
Further support for the idea of joint ventures and alliances comes from Mr
Klaus-Michael Kuehne, chairman and chief executive of Swiss-based global
freight forwarder Kuehne &amp; Nagel.
He says that when studying which markets to serve, forwarders and express
companies have to decide whether they can do it on their own, irrespective
of the enormous investments required for that kind of venture, or combine
the strength and synergies of different service providers in new forms of
co-operation.
'One option could be strategic alliances with chosen competitors with
clearly defined activities in the field of specific market distribution,' he
told last year's World Express &amp; Mail Conference in Munich, Germany.
'Another option could be a joint venture forwarder and a cargo-minded
airline, with a selected number of competitors or a combination of both, to
become a key player in express activities.'
The most substantial example of co-operation between airlines and express
companies, or integrators as they are sometimes known, involves DHL
Worldwide Express. It is developing increasingly close links with German
airline Lufthansa and Japanese carrier Japan Air Lines which now each hold a
25 per cent stake in the courier/air express company. As part of the same
development, Japanese trading house Nissho Iwai has built up a 7.5 per cent
stake.
Mr Patrick Lupo, the Brussels-based chairman and chief executive officer for
DHL International, claims the company's alliance with Lufthansa, JAL and
Nissho Iwai 'significantly strengthens our uplift and long haul capabilities
and enhances our airport handling capacity throughout the world'. Customers,
he adds, get access to a much broader menu of services.
Current examples of co-operation between DHL and Lufthansa include
activities at the air express company's recently-established Nordic area hub
in Copenhagen, Denmark. DHL has become the anchor tenant, with around 40 per
cent of the accommodation, in a new facility developed by a consortium
including the German airline.
In a similar vein, DHL plans to become a major tenant of JAL's new cargo
facility at JFK Airport, New York. JAL is currently investing something like
Dollars 100m in what was a former Pan American cargo terminal to make it one
of the most advanced facilities in the world.
DHL is co-operating with both JAL and Lufthansa by using its own regional
hub and spoke distribution systems in markets such as the US for the onward
movement to final destination of freight carried on the two airlines'
longhaul aircraft.
Leading forwarders, too, are looking to establish closer relationships with
airlines in a bid to compete with the express specialists. But, warns Mr
Kuehne, co-operation between airlines and forwarders needs to be improved if
such moves are to succeed. The traditional role of the forwarder as an agent
of the carrier, fulfilling a kind of sub-contractor function, is no longer
sufficient, he argues.
'In future, you will have to offer the best possible service as one product.
And that should be a joint product of the airline and the forwarder. It
should be developed jointly and offered jointly,' he says.
Rather more controversial is the idea that express companies and traditional
freight forwarding agents could also benefit from working together on a
global basis. Mr Malone of Federal Express said some industry leaders were
convinced that agents and integrators would only realise their growth
potential by working together as a team to serve global shippers. But there
were many others in the industry who did not share that view.
'Some agents feel the integrators are trying to put them out of business,
that the integrators are disrupting agents' plans to expand their control
and influence on the shippers. Integrators, on the other hand, have invested
millions of dollars in service networks to meet new shippers' demands and
feel this segment of the business is fair game,' he said.
Federal Express, claimed Mr Malone, felt the answer lay somewhere between
those different views and that the global shipper could be best served when
agents and integrators worked as a service team. But he admitted forging
such alliances would not be easy.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (3): The roads become
longer and clearer - Europe's single market opportunities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
EARLY enthusiasm among express industry companies for the rapid development
of their own large European networks has now been replaced by greater
caution and an urgent need to keep costs firmly under control.
Recession and the sight of both leading international operators and domestic
companies having to retrench after finding it too costly to develop or
sustain intra-European networks have had a salutary effect on the industry
as a whole.
More positively, the advent of the EC Single Market and the resulting
removal of intra-EC border controls has stimulated some new express industry
development. In particular, there has been a noticeable expansion of
road-based delivery services.
Still to be resolved, though, is who will be the longer term express
industry winners and losers in the European market.
Some observers claim only established international operators have the
experience and resources to be successful. Mr Bryan Draper, managing
director of UK domestic parcels carrier Elan, maintains that in order to
offer a total package, express parcel delivery companies cannot serve Europe
alone.
'I believe that parcels companies without a full international pedigree are
going to receive extremely bloody noses from the guys who are not only there
already but who are also geared up for the future with very experienced and
wide open eyes,' he says.
Other express industry observers and service operators, though, disagree.
They believe there is room in the intra-European market for well-organised
alliances and partnerships between leading national or regional operators.
Leading UK overnight parcels delivery company Securicor Omega Express (SOE),
for instance, has set up its Network Europe operation on that basis. Plans
include developing a 48/72-hour road-based cross-border trunking network,
sub- contracting most of the domestic pick-up and delivery operations in
each country to local operators.
Another UK parcels carrier, Amtrak, recently introduced a new European
express road/ferry service called Airtrak Roadlink, operated in conjunction
with Continental delivery agents, to join its established European courier
and express operations. United Carriers plans to launch a 'comprehensive'
range of European express parcel services in June as part of a system called
General Parcel being established by a group of companies in different
countries. And Seabourne Express Group is using the European rail network to
develop delivery services to Belgium, France, Germany and Italy.
Meanwhile, Mayne Nickless group UK parcels carrier Parceline is stepping up
promotion of its Euroline service which was launched last year to provide
36/48-hour road-based delivery to 14 European countries. A daily trailer
runs between Parceline's UK hub at Birmingham and a Continental hub at Boom,
Belgium where traffic is fed into the networks of various European delivery
partners.
A key advantage of using such a system, claims Mr Colin Millbanks, Parceline
chief executive, is that it keeps down costs. 'From day one, we have been
able to offer a comprehensive service which is low cost and does not rely on
considerable increases in volume in order to get down the conventional cost
curve. Consequently, it was immediately profitable,' he says.
In fact, Parceline recently cut rates for the Euroline service, although it
will not give precise figures. Rivals claim the move reflects the
increasingly tough battle for intra-European express traffic. Parceline
maintains it simply reflects the economies of scale being gained through
increased traffic volumes being handled by the service.
Either way, the reduction of rates for Euroline fits in with a
widely-predicted longer-term trend towards lower prices in the European
express market. That point was highlighted by Mr Tony Keating, European
director of logistics for international parcels giant United Parcel Service
(UPS), when he spoke at a recent postal and parcel services conference in
London.
He claimed that rates for overnight delivery of parcels within Europe were
still around twice those for similar operations in the United States. But
with the advent of the EC Single Market, the gap should start to close.
To make his point, he compared the published full rate tariff for delivering
a parcel overnight in Europe, for example between Glasgow, Scotland and
Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and over the same sort of distance within the
US, say between Indianapolis and Philadelphia.
For overnight delivery by air in the US, a three-kilo parcel would cost
around Dollars 20 and a 10-kilo parcel Dollars 37. And by road, which would
give next-day delivery although not next morning, the rates could be as low
as Dollars 2.80 for the three-kilo item and Dollars 5 for 10 kilos.
Full rate tariff for the Glasgow-Amsterdam overnight delivery, continued Mr
Keating, would be around Dollars 44 for a three-kilo parcel and Dollars 70
for the larger item. Even discounted rates would still be around Dollars 30
and Dollars 49 respectively.
Main reasons for that disparity, he said, were the huge economies of scale
in the US market, greater efficiencies brought about by fierce competition
and the wider use of technology like vehicle/computer communications.
'The huge economies of scale are probably the most important factor in this.
But as larger operations appear in Europe, I see no reason why these
economies should not be achieved over here,' commented Mr Keating.
In line with the move to reduce costs for express delivery services in
Europe, and boosted by the removal of intra-EC border controls, leading
operators are beefing up the development of road-based services to run in
tandem with their more expensive air express systems.
Mr John Mullen, chief executive of TNT Express Worldwide, believes there is
going to be further substantial upgrading of European road transport
operations and more competition. 'We are almost certainly going to witness
some important entries from overseas, particularly from the US, who view the
European road market as a big opportunity,' he says.
As if to confirm that point, US airfreight/air express company Emery
Worldwide earlier this year launched a new road-based intra-European
operation called Cross Continent Service. Initially available within the EC,
future plans for CCS include extending the service to cover countries
outside the EC, for example in Eastern Europe. That intention reflects a
general belief among express companies that developments in Eastern Europe
are opening up new opportunities.
For the moment, though, the most immediate stimulus for European express
industry development is the arrival of the Single Market. In addition to the
removal of border controls, increased viability of centralised
warehousing/distribution is generating demand for fast, frequent, reliable
delivery systems.
Not all EC developments have been positive for the express industry, though.
VAT issues are causing uncertainty and there is concern over the outcome of
the EC Green Paper on postal services due to have been discussed this month
by European Council Ministers. Express companies want to know how far
cross-border mail/express services will be deregulated, what will be
reserved for the post offices and how such 'reserved' traffic will be
designated.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (5): Regulation inhibits ambition - Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN WARN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHILE'S banks are not short of ambition. Some in the industry are pressing
for the lifting of curbs on their domestic and international activities,
with the aim of becoming a regional banking centre on the Swiss model.
Whether the government will allow the banks to fulfil these ambitions is
another question - not least because the central bank is still left with a
tab of almost Dollars 4bn from bailing out the banking system a decade ago.
Chile's banks feel they are at a disadvantage in the region, because of the
restrictions that banking regulators place on their ownership of other
companies, and on the setting up of branches and issuing of loans abroad.
'Our natural sphere of influence is Latin America,' says Mr Hernan
Sommerville, vice-chairman of the Chilean Association of Banks. 'We want to
go international. But we are allowing other banks in the region to position
themselves at our expense. Every day that goes by is a wasted day,' he adds.
'The crisis of the 1980s has made our regulators cautious. But we came out
of that crisis with a very solid banking system. If Chilectra and other
industrial companies can buy companies in Argentina, then why can't we?'
asks Mr Sommerville.
On the domestic side, the banks want a share of the lucrative pensions and
insurance businesses, and to undertake activities such as factoring and
securitisation. Banks are allowed to sell pensions and insurance only
through subsidiaries. The real prize for them would be the freedom to sell
such products directly through their extensive branch networks.
The banks are also facing challenges from other financial institutions on
their own turf, with customers able to open savings accounts through the
pension funds.
The majority of Chile's 14 domestic banks, including the two biggest, Banco
de Chile and Banco de Santiago, are still indebted to the central bank.
Imprudent lending, particularly complex networks of inter-group loans,
pushed the financial system over the brink in 1983.
The central bank was forced to assume the banks' non-performing loans as the
price for keeping it going.
Debtor banks are now constrained to hand over 70 per cent of after-tax
profits to pay off this so-called subordinated debt, which produced a total
payment to the central bank of about Dollars 209m last year.
'The present situation on the subordinated debt creates a disincentive to
make profits,' said a Santiago diplomat. 'If a bank has to hand over most of
its profits to the central bank, then it's tempting to find something else
to do with the money - such as building a state-of-the-art executive gym. At
present payment rates, some banks may never clear their debts.'
The central bank is also left bearing the bulk of the risk of indebted
banks.
The quandary for the government is: Should it allow banks to widen their
field of activities while the subordinated debt issue is unresolved? Or
should it use the prospect of liberalisation to pressure banks on the debt?
In an election year with a busy legislative timetable, it may prove tempting
to leave the dilemma for the next administration. 'An initiative to deal
with the subordinated debt is really just waiting on political backing,'
says Mr Joaquin Vial, chief economist at the finance ministry.
Chile's banks, which experienced decreasing profitability after posting
strong gains from non-operational activities such as debt-equity swaps in
the late 1980s, bounced back last year. Net profits, after payment of
subordinated debt obligations, grew by 23 per cent in real terms to 94bn
pesos (Dollars 250m). Consumer loan business was particularly strong,
growing at a rate of 50 per cent.
With figures like these, it is hard to argue that the health of the system
is at risk unless the banks are freed from their shackles.
'Other banks can grow, so the financing needs of the country can be met,'
says Mr Daniel Tapia, adviser to the board of Banco BICE, a small boutique
bank which did not sell its debt on to the central bank. 'The system is
working so that I don't see why we can't go on like this for the next 50
years.'
One suggestion is for healthy banks to take over the indebted ones in
exchange for writedowns. Some banks may already be positioning themselves to
benefit from such an outcome.
In March this year, Banco O'Higgins, a small bank which has cleared its
obligations to the central bank, merged with Banco CentroHispano, the
Chilean subsidiary of Banco Central Hispanoamericano of Spain, to create
Chile's third-largest banking group, with share capital of Dollars 140m.
Banco O'Higgins is controlled by the Luksic group, a Chilean holding company
owned by businessman Mr Andronico Luksic, which in turn owns 20 per cent of
Banco de Santiago, the second-biggest bank.
An initiative on the subordinated debt problem could set the stage for a
further merger. But in the meantime Banco O'Higgins benefits from economies
of scale - the combined operation is expected to reduce its total workforce
by 15-20 per cent to around 2,000. It can also take advantage of its new
partner's links with Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil, and its presence in the
domestic pensions and insurance business.
Chilean banks may find further consolidation a way of attaining at least
some of their goals, even if more liberal banking laws and a subordinated
debt initiative have to wait.
