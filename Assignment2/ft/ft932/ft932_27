FT  15 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Smaller shares hit the comeback
trail - And a revival is certainly overdue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAS THE revival of the smaller company share arrived at last? The first
quarter of 1993 certainly suggested so. The extended Hoare Govett Smaller
Companies index (excluding investment trusts) rose 15.2 per cent over the
period (including dividends), compared with growth of just 4.6 per cent in
the FT-A All-Share index.
A revival is definitely overdue. The Hoare Govett index underperformed the
All-Share for the four consecutive years from 1989 to 1992. Not only was
this the first four-year period since 1955 in which this phenomenon occurred
 -there had been no previous consecutive three-year period of small company
underperformance.
Over the period since 1955, Hoare Govett figures show that its smaller
companies index has produced returns of 18 per cent a year, some 4 per cent
ahead of the returns achieved by the All-Share.
Why did smaller company shares perform so well? It is obviously easier for a
small company to grow at 50 per cent a year than it is for, say, ICI. A
second reason is that small company shares are less 'efficient' - in other
words, researched less well than companies in the FT-SE 100. There is more
scope for the shrewd fund manager to pick a winner.
With these higher rewards come higher risks, however, as investors
discovered between 1989 and 1992. 'Earnings' growth of smaller companies is
greater but it is more volatile,' says Paul Woolley, of fund manager GMO
Woolley. His figures show small company profits were hit particularly badly
in recessions such as 1973-74, 1979-80 and 1990-92.
The lack of diversity of smaller companies makes them more vulnerable to the
problems of individual customers and market niches - and to the fortunes of
the UK economy; thus, the latest recession hit them particularly hard. The
illiquidity of their shares worsened the effect on prices.
But the very factors which held smaller companies back should help them
prosper in the recovery. Douglas Ferrans, of Scottish Amicable Investment
Managers, writes in the group's monthly investment review: 'Smaller
companies should now enjoy growth in productivity, a widening of margins and
superior growth in earnings.'
Even if you accept these arguments, how much of the recovery is in the
price? The FT-Small Cap index is trading at present on an historic
price-earnings ratio of 31.25, far higher than the FT-SE 100 and pretty racy
by any standards. According to Ferrans, though, if you exclude loss-makers
and use the latest reported earnings' figures, the ratio falls to around 20.
'On our measure of valuation, small company shares are currently
under-valued,' says Woolley, adding that this applies particularly to the
relationship of price to assets. 'However, this under-valuation is not as
stark as the over-valuation smaller companies reached in 1987.'
There certainly does seem to be a change in the climate of opinion towards
small companies. Hoare Govett is seizing the opportunity to launch a second
investment trust linked to its extended index. The first trust, launched in
December, raised Pounds 28.5m. The new trust will invest in more than 200
companies and, by aiming to match the index, will remove the danger of poor
stock selection. The full prospectus is expected to appear in June.
For most private investors, a collective fund probably is the best way of
backing the small company revival (if they believe the argument). The
best-performing investment trust in the sector over the past three and five
years has been Foreign &amp; Colonial Smaller Companies; over 10 years, the
leader is Moorgate.
The average UK smaller companies unit trust has achieved a rise of just 16
per cent over the five years to May 1 (offer-to-bid with net income
re-invested; source: Micropal). Returns range from the 92 per cent growth of
Royal Life UK Emerging Companies to the 25.3 per cent decline of the
Waverley Penny share.
Trusts in the sector with above-average performance over one, three, five
and 10 years are Edinburgh UK Smaller Companies, Lazard UK Smaller Companies
Growth, and New Court Smaller UK Companies. Edinburgh's fund is also the
best performer over both three and 10 years.
There is also an indexed fund in the unit trust sector: James Capel's Trixie
trust. But it has not done especially well to date; Micropal shows it as
48th of 66 in the sector over the year to May 1. Nigel Legge, of James
Capel, says the recent rally has allowed active managers to outperform;
however, he expects the fund to produce an above-average performance in the
sector over the long term.
There is an automatic tendency for private investors to prefer buying 'blue
chips' because they know the names and products of the companies concerned.
But the long-term performance of small company shares indicates that
investors should not ignore the area altogether. After all, putting less
than 10 per cent of your portfolio in the smallest 10 per cent of the market
is actually betting against the small company sector.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Getting a fix on your income - An
unsettled sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GILTS had an unsettled time in the UK last month, with prices generally
weakening. Economic news suggested that the recovery could have started at
last, bringing reduced hopes of an interest rate cut.
Jim Dunsford, director of fixed income at James Capel Fund Managers (which
runs Midland's Gilt &amp; Fixed Interest unit trust; see table), believes
interest rates will fall to 5 per cent by the end of the year; this would
tend to push up the price of short-dated gilts with a corresponding drop in
yields. However, the government's need to find buyers for new gilts issues
would conspire to push up yields and so make prices of long-dated gilts
fall.
Because of this mixed outlook, Dunsford believes private investors should
still invest part of their assets in a bond fund - unit trusts which invest
in a portfolio of bonds to provide both income and capital growth. The
initial charge on the Midland fund is 4 per cent, the annual fee is 0.5 per
cent and the minimum lump sum investment is Pounds 1,000. There is a monthly
savings plan for a minimum of Pounds 50 a month.
David Dyer, fund manager of Axa Equity &amp; Law's Gilt and Fixed Interest unit
trust, says investors have had two or three years of strong performance from
gilts as UK interest rates have fallen. He thinks further rate cuts are
unlikely but, with the average yield of a 10-year gilt at 8 per cent and the
headline rate of inflation at 1.9 per cent in the year to March, 'investors
are still enjoying a very attractive real return.' The Axa fund has a 5.5
per cent initial charge, a 1 per cent annual charge, and a minimum
investment of Pounds 1,000.
The market for permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs) - fixed-interest
shares issued by building societies to raise capital - was broadened this
month with a new issue by First National, Ireland's second-largest building
society. The shares are not classified as qualifying corporate bonds under
UK law and, unlike other Pibs, are liable to capital gains tax.
Hoare Govett, which helped launch the issue, says: 'The Irish housing market
did not suffer a price boom in the 1980s and so there are very low rates of
repossession and arrears, resulting in a building society that is much more
stable than its UK counterpart. Even so, when assessing this stock to a
comparable UK building society Pibs' issue - for example, Newcastle - there
is still a yield pick-up of more than 1 per cent.'

FT  15 MAY 93 / Property Plus: How to date your house - Expert help in
tracing the history of your home is not hard to find
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW OLD is my house? And how can I improve it without damaging its
historical character?
A quick answer to the second question could be: do not put in plastic
windows or face the exterior walls with stick-on rusticated stonework. And
think twice about adding a Victorian-style conservatory - often they do not
fit, which may be why so few were built in the first place. The full answer
is to find out its history and then decide how to alter it or, in the light
of what you discover, leave it as it is.
You never know what you may find. Houses are long-lived animals that survive
changes in almost every generation. Behind the chain-store high street
facades lurk medieval merchants' houses. (In Barnstaple, Devon, do not miss
the Tudor shipmaster's ornate plastered ceiling in the Woolwich Building
Society.) And, surprisingly often, village houses turn out to have Georgian
fronts.
Start by examining the house thoroughly yourself. Look out for blocked
windows, doors and stairs. If the floor changes level, why? Did the house
once have its own well, or built-in copper cauldron for the laundry? Has it
always had the same main entrance? You will find it easy to spot some of the
alterations, although arranging them in sequence may be hard.
See what Pevsner's guides say about the house and whether there is an entry
in Victoria County History, the title of a series of county histories which
you should find in the public library. If it is listed, the particulars are
recorded in the relevant section of the Department of the
Environment/Department of National Heritage Green Book (in the public
library or at the local planning authority). There may also be entries in
the Sites and Monuments Record (SMR) which the local archaeological unit
keeps (the county council will tell you where to find them) and at the
county records office.
If you do not have the time, inclination or background for this research,
seek out the experts. They will survey the building and work out its history
from the bricks and mortar and will search documents, should you require.
The archaeological units, which advise councils on what to do with planning
applications for listed buildings (and sometimes for non-listed) and for
scheduled ancient monuments, usually have a contract side to survey
buildings. There are also private consultants.
They will produce reports with photographs and plans, sections and
elevations drawn to scale, which should tell you much more than you alone
could discover. They will also help if you are contemplating work on the
house and will probably also want to put the information into the SMR for
future use.
A typical brief for the Canterbury Archaeological Trust, one of the local
units, was a derelict bus garage which was to be restored as offices. It
might have seemed an unpromising start but the team recovered two-bay
medieval building with a crown post roof, and 17th and 19th century
additions. After the first world war it lost its original facade and first
floor framing when it was converted to a garage.
For more precise dating of the medieval part, they could have use
dendrochronology, taking sections from one of the larger beams or coring
samples. This would show the pattern of annual growth rings, some thick and
some thin, which reflect the patterns of medieval weather.
Trees grow more in wet, warm years. Thin rings mean harsh winters. The next
task is to match the 'floating' sample to master patterns which have been
built up by correlating hundreds of samples and counting them backwards from
the present. Computers make this fairly easy and will produce dates for the
rings.
These dates give the year of the latest ring preserved. If the beam still
has its bark that will be the date the tree was cut - which may be few years
before it was used in the building. Tree rings have remarkable accuracy, and
have dated the monastic barn at Great Coxwell, in Oxfordshire, to within a
decade of 1300, settling an argument that ran between the early 12th and
late 14th centuries.
The Greater Manchester Unit recently surveyed a cottage in the nearby
village of Broadbottom for its owners. The cottage is the only surviving
building of cloth printing works built beside the fast-flowing river
Etherow, and in use from around 1763 to 1919.
The records produce a complicated history, which probably began with a still
earlier corn mill on the site, followed by a woollen mill converted for
cotton in the mill boom of the 1790s. It prospered until the mid-19th
century, with 450 workers in 1851, when business started to decline.
Printing stopped in 1913. Then, the Happy Bran Company made soap powder
until 1919 in part of the works, when it was sold.
The Greater Manchester unit worked out that the Cottage had four building
phases which mirrored the history of what the 1919 sale particulars called
'the most famous Calico Printing Works in England.' The lucky owners now
have a fascinating history of their cottage and the details they needed to
extend it.
Ron Shoesmith, of the Hereford Unit, stresses that much of the work is to
ensure that buildings are understood before they are altered. Listed (and
convertible) barns in Wales and an old button and buckle factory in Walsall,
for which a housing trust was seeking planning permission, have been recent
briefs. The unit has also surveyed two old gate houses for the Landmark
Trust.
The unit's most intriguing brief evokes Petra in Jordan, or the troglodyte
life of early man. The National Trust commissioned the unit to survey rows
of rock-cut houses at Kinver Edge, in Shropshire, before restoring two as a
single house or for the custodian.
These rare dwellings are partly cut out of the rock, partly built up in
stone in front. Farm workers and iron workers use to live in them. The
oldest record is of 1800 but they probably go back earlier, and they were in
use until the 1950s or 1960s. They are two-bedroom houses and at one time
there were 11 families in the row. When they wanted a house, they did not
have to pay. The contractor paid them to quarry the stone. Canterbury

Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits at Body Shop, the cosmetics group, fell 15 per cent in the year to
end-February, ending the company's previously rapid growth. Although the
group is expanding internationally, the group suffered from falling sales
and profits in the UK. However, the group did feel confident enough to
increase its total dividend by 6.2 per cent. The company did issue a profits
warning last autumn, so the news was not unexpected. The shares rose 6.5p to
204.5p on the day of the announcement but had dropped back to 196p by the
end of the week. They have rebounded a long way from the year's low of 133p.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Housing sales get a spring in their
step - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Housing activity showed a strong year-on-year rise in April with gross sales
up 13.3 per cent on April 1992, according to the Corporate Estate Agents
Property Index. Compared with March there was a 4.1 per cent decline in
gross sales, but this reflected the impact of public holidays.
Gross sales are defined as the number of new sales agreed in the month,
subject to contract and which normally have a completed chain, finance
arranged and solicitors instructed. The number of deals where contracts were
exchanged rose 8.3 per cent year-on-year and fell 5.5 per cent on March.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Markets: ISIS: a trust with a novel twist - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW INVESTMENT trusts may be regular occurrences these days, but when one
comes along with a different twist and an aggressive marketing campaign, it
is worth a closer look. Such is the ISIS trust from Ivory &amp; Sime. Its
central plank is exploiting the Pounds 5,800 capital gains tax allowance
which many investors leave unused. The sale of shares is taxed under the CGT
regime and not as income tax.
Under the ISIS scheme, the trust automatically will sell 7 per cent of an
investor's holding in order to generate a monthly income plan. The first
Pounds 5,800 of income from these sales would be tax-free. For basic-rate
taxpayers, a 7 per cent tax-free income would be the equivalent of a 9.33
per cent gross return from a building society.
The danger with this route, of course, is that investors could simply be
returning their capital to themselves in the form of income. The trust needs
to grow at a rate of at least 7 per cent annually for the scheme to work.
One important wrinkle in this structure is that the trust is selling all its
dividend income to institutions upfront in the form of convertible annuity
shares. This has its good and bad sides. The good is that selling the shares
(which have virtually no repayment value) boosts the asset value of the
ordinary shares by 10 per cent; so, ordinary share investors are buying at a
discount to asset value - an unusual position for a new issue. The bad news
is that dividend income is an important part of equity return. It will be
more difficult for the trust to achieve 7 per cent growth without the help
of the market yield.
ISIS, however, will be concentrating its portfolio in low-yielding equities
where growth prospects should be greater. And the trust says that, since
1945, the market has achieved an annual capital return of 7.8 per cent per
annum. Of course, this might not be repeated in the 1990s.
There is a further hurdle. Those who want income will be regular sellers;
the trust needs a source of buyers to ensure a balance, and to prevent the
shares slumping to a discount. Accordingly, it will offer a regular savings
plan with the attraction of bonus warrants. These warrants offer the
prospect for additional capital gain. For those who are likely to pay CGT,
there is a personal equity plan available.
The plan certainly is ingenious. Some might argue that there is nothing
brilliant about converting capital gain into income and that investors could
do it for themselves by selling 7 per cent of their own share portfolios
every year. But this would involve substantial costs (especially for small
investors); the ISIS method is very cheap.
Things could go wrong. A bear market might eat up investors' capital very
quickly, and the trust could find that the demands of the income
shareholders and the savings scheme do not balance. Philip Middleton, of
Smith New Court, says investors should realise that ISIS is not a straight
swap for a building society; there is no guarantee of capital. Only those
investors comfortable with equity risk should apply. But, he adds, it offers
a tax-efficient way of getting income.
Another trust trying to raise new money is Fleming Claverhouse, the UK
blue-chip fund. Its problem has been success, with demand for shares so
swamping supply that the price occasionally has reached a premium of 9 per
cent above asset value. The answer is an issue of new shares, available to
existing investors and others. Although, because of issue costs, these
shares also will be at a premium to asset value, the premium will be smaller
 -around 3.6 per cent.
The issue looks complicated. 'Conversion' shares are being offered, which
are expected to convert into ordinary shares in June. The reason for the
complexity is the need to be fair to all shareholders.
Immediately after the offer, Fleming Claverhouse will have a pot of new
money, ranging from Pounds 100m (the maximum possible) to a more likely
Pounds 25m-Pounds 35m. It would not be prudent or wise to invest this money
straight away. But if the market rises sharply, the trust's large cash
holding would cause it to underperform the index. That would be unfair to
existing shareholders. So, the two pools of assets will be kept separate and
the two classes of shares combined only when the new money has been invested
in the market.
It is encouraging to see that good, solid, conventional investment trusts
are able to raise new money and Fleming Claverhouse's record certainly makes
it a trust worth watching (see Page VI).
Meanwhile, three cheers for TR City Of London, which has cut the annual
management charge on its personal equity plan. As I reported after the
Budget, the change in the tax credit on dividends had made the Pep
unattractive for basic-rate taxpayers, since the charge was higher than the
tax benefit. Now, TR has cut the charge from 1 per cent to 0.75 per cent
annually plus VAT. On a yield of 4.4 per cent, the annual dividend on Pounds
6,000 would be Pounds 264, and the basic rate-payer would save Pounds 52.80
in tax.
The annual charge on Pounds 6,000 works out at around Pounds 52.87 per year,
so the basic rate-payer will break even. But there is the CGT exemption as
well and, once the investment grows to more than Pounds 6,000, the annual
charge falls to 0.5 per cent, so the Pep-holder should move into profit.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Markets: Inflation puts Fed back in the spotlight - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL EYES are back on the Federal Reserve after this week's worrying
inflation numbers.
It seems a long time since Wall Street has had the Fed in its sights. The
last time the central bank fiddled with monetary policy was September last
year, when it lowered the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage
point to 3 per cent. And the last time the Fed made anything like a
meaningful move was back in July 1992, when it cut the discount rate by half
a percentage point to 3 per cent.
In the intervening months, the stock and bond markets have had little reason
to think about the Fed. Instead, the presidential election, rebounding
corporate earnings, an increasingly muddled economic picture, the Clinton
fiscal stimulus package and first budget, the restructuring of the Treasury
debt, even the war in Bosnia, have all grabbed the attention of the markets
at one time or another.
In fact, since last autumn, the only time the Fed has really captured the
markets' imagination was when its chairman, Alan Greenspan, sat next to
Hillary Rodham Clinton at her husband's first State of the Union address to
Congress, an extraordinary sight that thoroughly confused Washington DC and
Wall Street alike.
The markets get nervous enough when they see the President and the Fed
chairman together, for a politicised central bank is the last thing Wall
Street needs. But the First Lady and the Fed chairman together, in apparent
harmony? Many minds boggled.
Now, however, the Fed is back in the spotlight, and sweating uncomfortably
under an inflationary glare that suddenly and unexpectedly intensified this
week. On Wednesday the April producer prices index was released, and it was
up 0.6 per cent on the month. A day later came the consumer prices index -
it was up 0.4 per cent.
Not only were both sets of headline data stronger than analysts' had
expected, but the 'core' measures of producer and consumer price inflation,
which exclude the volatile food and energy components, were also above Wall
Street's estimates. The figures sparked heavy selling in the bond market,
where the 30-year bond yield jumped from 6.81 per cent to 6.97 per cent in
just two days.
Although the stock markets managed to shrug off the producer prices number,
and even pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a record high on
Thursday, they could not ignore the rise in consumer prices. It was the
third report out of the last four that has shown monthly consumer prices
rising faster than expected.
Last year consumer prices rose 2.9 per cent - so far this year, they are
rising at an annual rate of 4.3 per cent. This should worry the Fed, which
in its annual report to Congress in February predicted that the CPI would
rise somewhere between 2.5 per cent and 2.75 per cent this year.
With a third of the year already out of the way, and an economy that is
still growing (albeit at a sluggish pace), it now appears unlikely that the
Fed's target range for the CPI will be reached.
This means that the Fed either will have to come up with a new, higher
target, or it will have to tighten monetary policy to slow the pace of
economic activity and bring the rate back to within its current range.
Greenspan and other Fed chiefs have in the past talked of getting inflation
down to near zero, so the latter course is the one more likely to be
pursued.
All of this is important for the stock markets. Low interest rates have been
the single most powerful factor at play in the markets over the past two
years. They have sustained stocks when the state of the economy and
corporate earnings have not justified prices at their high valuations. Low
rates have worked wonders by lowering the cost of capital for corporations,
and by squeezing investors out of low-yielding short-term financial assets
such as certificates of deposit and money market funds, and into equities.
If interest rates go up, the flow of investor funds from fixed-interest
assets into stocks could reverse. Higher rates would also force investors to
revise their expectations of economic growth and corporate profitability.
With prices struggling to hold their ground at or near their all-time highs,
the markets' fall could be precipitous.
The big question is: will the Fed have the courage to raise interest rates
this year, especially now that the chairman and Hillary Clinton are such
good chums?

FT  15 MAY 93 / Markets: A creak, a groan, and a muffled sigh - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, financial editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAR AWAY, at the back of the dark, bat-infested cave that does duty as the
collective memory of the London markets, you can hear a faint, ominous
creak.
It is instantly identifiable to anyone who has ever watched a Christopher
Lee movie as the sound of a sarcophagous lid. Slowly, cautiously, it lifts.
An eerie glow escapes from inside. Terrified peasants, mumbling
long-forgotten prayers, cluster around the tomb. A word, a murmur passes
from lip to lip . . . a name no living mortal has heard in years. Still no
more than a whisper, it strikes chill to the bone: 'Barber . . . Barber . .
. Barber'
The spectral figure stirring at the back of the cave is not the real Lord
Barber, the amiable ex-Chancellor/ex-banker, but his symbolic alter-ego, aka
the Barber Boom, the rapid burst of inflationary growth in 1972-3 that
followed the Heath government's U-turn away from austerity.
Astonishing though it may seem - at least to anyone not brought up on a diet
of late night horror movies - this spectre, long thought buried at a
cross-roads with a stake through its heart, now walks the land. Or at least,
it walks the densely printed pages of Ian Harnett's stock market analysis
for Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, the broker.
Pondering the likely scale of the economic recovery, he and his economist
colleague Corey Miller remind us that the government's leading economic
indicator is at a level not seen since - yes, you guessed it, the Barber
boom, when gdp growth touched 10 per cent.
That is not all. Monetary policy is also exceptionally loose, if you measure
it in a way which adds together the impact of laxer interest rates and a
lower exchange rate. And though the Strauss Turnbull economic forecast is
more optimistic than the consensus, at around 2 per cent gdp growth for 1993
and 3 per cent in 1994, this only produces a peak annualised growth rate of
some 4 1/2 per cent.
In practice, the economy tends to move more abruptly, both up and down, than
economists predict: the peak annual rate in the 1983 recovery was 8.6 per
cent; in the 1976 upturn it was 7.7 per cent. You could draw the conclusion
that this recovery is likely to be more anaemic than its predecessors. Or
you could conclude that there will be a burst of faster growth than economic
forecasts would suggest - closely followed, perhaps, by inflation and a
hasty slamming-on of the brakes, as the chancellor tries to avoid joining
Lord Barber at the back of the cave. Perhaps that is what the rise in longer
term interest rates was trying to tell us earlier this spring.
Such worries have had little effect on the market this week. The yield on
10-year gilts was scarcely changed, closing on Friday at 8.09 per cent, up
from the previous week's 8.08. The equity market has been more cheerful: the
FT-SE 100 index closed at 2847.0, up 53.3. One common factor in both markets
was the thought that the government's political weakness might push it into
an early cut in interest rates, perhaps next Friday when the inflation rate
for April is expected to fall to an annual rate of 1.5 per cent.
If the short-term domestic outlook was relatively optimistic this week, the
same could not be said for the international scene. Inflation worries
revived in the US (though earlier in the week a strong performance by Wall
Street lent added impetus to London's recovery). More important, perhaps,
the economic outlook in continental Europe took another turn for the worse,
with an extraordinarily steep fall in output at Mercedes Benz in the first
quarter - car production was 39 per cent lower than in the same period a
year ago - and fresh turmoil in the exchange rate mechanism as Spain and
Portugal devalued after a day of uncertainty in the currency markets.
International concerns will continue to play a role next week, when
Denmark's vote on the Maastricht treaties takes place on Tuesday.
In the domestic market, the big stock of the week was ICI, which carried out
the trickiest part of its demerger of Zeneca, its biosciences side, on
Tuesday, with the pricing of Zeneca's five-for-sixteen Pounds 1.3bn rights
issue. At the rights price, the Zeneca shares yield 5.7 per cent on the
forecast dividend of 27.5p for the year, an unusually juicy yield
considering that the figure for the Health and Household sector as a whole
is just over 3 per cent.
Although the demerger does not finally take effect until June, grey market
trading has already begun in the shares of the successor companies. The
trend throughout the week was away from glamorous, high-flying Zeneca and
towards boring old cyclical ICI, partly refecting investment sentiment in
the US market. Zeneca ex-rights closed the week at 636p, down from the 682p
at which it was first quoted on Tuesday and 14 per cent above the rights
issue price. New-ICI closed at 622p, up from Tuesday's 569p. The existing
ICI shares, enjoying their Indian spring, closed at 1263p, up 20p on the
week.
The other big stock of the week was BT, not so much for the scale of its
redundancy costs, which lopped Pounds 1.1bn off its pre-tax profits for the
year ended March, announced on Thursday, but for the Pounds 750m pension
fund deficit it announced at the same time.
Part of the deficit stemmed from the cost of paying off workers; but just as
worrying were the other two contributors to the deficit, the impact of ACT
and a much lower than expected growth in dividends received on the fund's
investments.
Most actuaries have been expecting a 5 per cent annual increase in
dividends; in fact, dividends for the market as a whole shrank 0.1 per cent
in 1992 and a further 1.8 per cent in the first quarter of 1993. One sure
way of getting dividends to grow again, of course, is inflation. Which is
where we, and the spectre, came in . . .

FT  15 MAY 93 / Nation in search of itself: Japan thinks itself a spiritual
country. Yet corporate identity is stronger than religious awareness. Robert
Thomson considers a cultural change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEASURING the ground with casual precision, Kiyoshi Sato prepares his fields
for a crop of rust-stained steel rods, the ribs of a vinyl greenhouse.
Instead of Bright Sun rice, the earth will be caressed by Sato into bearing
Prince melons, more profitable than the sacred grain but strangers in Suye
village, where the rhythms of life always have been in tune with the rise
and fall of the rice crop.
The cultural rhythms of Japan are out of synch.
Remarkable industrial growth is popularly viewed against a romanticised
rural background. The reassuring images of the 'old village', the furusato,
are essential to the sense of being Japanese. A family might live in Tokyo
but it will tell you that its furusato is somewhere like Suye, a relatively
rustic village on the southern island of Kyushu.
It is not just a sense of 'place' that is under assault. The Japanese are
taught that industrial success was inspired by a deep-rooted 'cultivator
spirit' that makes them unique. The theory is that Japanese work together
harmoniously in an electronics company because they have a shared tradition
of planting and harvesting rice. Westerners, however, are said to be
hunter-gatherers - they eat what they kill, and their companies are just as
selfish and compulsive.
The cultivator theme is played over and over in the classroom, and is echoed
during negotiations when Japan defends its rice market against imports.
Appealing as the theme might be to older Japanese, it bewilders the urban
young, whose only links to the land are sentimental descriptions in a
textbook. For Japan, the last rice crop of Sato in Suye village is another
disturbing symbol of a creeping identity crisis that no one wants to
confront.
Suye was visited in the mid-1930s by a meticulous US sociologist, John
Embree*, who found a remote, content community gradually being co-opted by a
powerful central bureaucracy. At the time, Japan was preparing for war, and
once isolated Suye suddenly became a sub-branch of the Patriotic Youth
Association, the Farmer's Co-operative, and the Women's Patriotic
Association, all strongly nationalistic. The villagers, ironic and warm,
accepted the changes as inevitable, and went on cultivating their fields.
The folk of Suye are still ironic and warm. They, more than the urban
dwellers who romanticise them, have a clear view of the altered cultural
landscape and of the need to redefine what it is to be Japanese. When Sato,
surrounded by withered rice stumps, contemplated the fate of the ground, he
smiled a wry smile: 'I don't suppose it matters. Modern Japanese can't tell
the difference between good rice and bad rice. You could give them quality
like Bright Sun and they wouldn't appreciate its worth.'
Sato is one of the last true cultivators, who comprise about three per cent
of the population. Farm machinery has undermined the old communal cause of
planting, harvesting and celebration of the harvesting. Even in the rural
heartland of Suye, only a third of the 1,620 villagers work in primary
industry. The rest toil in factories, offices or shops, perhaps at the towns
of Menda or Takagi, now 10 minutes by car, but, traditionally, a long walk
only rarely worth making.
Suye village is still remote from the political scandal and financial market
turmoil of Tokyo. There is one restaurant, a Shinto shrine, a few vending
machines, an all-purpose convenience store, a couple of car repair shops,
and a factory, KM Clothing, with 100 staff, the largest employer. The only
policeman is based in the neighbouring village of Fukada, and his greatest
concern is traffic accidents, which have risen with the vinyl greenhouses -
in the old days, drivers had clear vision across empty fields, and they
still drive as though they do.
Television has diluted the local dialect by forcing standard Japanese, Tokyo
talk, into local living rooms. And it has encouraged the village to
contemplate the outside world, though Japanese programmes tend to reinforce
cultural differences rather than explore common characteristics. Foreign
workers have arrived recently in the nearby towns: women from Thailand in
the bars and hostess clubs, construction workers from China, and exchange
students from privileged Western backgrounds.
In the face of change, Masatsugu Saiki puts extra emphasis on honouring the
past. He runs a dairy farm with 32 cattle, and grows rice on the side.
Fading photographs of his grandfather and mother are displayed alongside a
row of Buddhist prayer cards politely requesting abundant harvests and good
health. Each day, Saiki pays homage to his ancestors, whose spirits are
encased in an an ornate wooden shrine, a butsudan, in a matted room near the
entrance to his home.
'There is a lot more competition these days. We are competing with each
other. The spirit of the area has changed. There are people that we don't
know around here. In the past we knew everyone.' Buddhist prayer cards
aside, Saiki is no mystic. He and his wife, Kumi, are in the cowshed by 5.30
most mornings. If, by chance, they oversleep, a Beethoven recording would
wake them.
Each morning at 6, 'Fur Elise' echoes across the paddy fields through a
loudspeaker system run by the village office. At lunchtime, Schubert reminds
them to eat, and at five in winter, six in summer, the local children are
alerted to return home by the strains of Yuyake Koyake, a folk song about
the setting sun and the blackbirds.
There is a deep love of the loudspeaker in Japan. Right-wingers use them to
condemn Chinese communists and corrupt Tokyo politicians. Suye village has a
loudspeaker car broadcasting traffic safety messages. In a nearby town, a
loudspeaker van delivered a message about a public lawyer's imminent visit
to counsel folk on legal disputes - in between the spoken messages, the van
played 'The Lord is My Shepherd'.
Apart from the private ancestor worship and the hymns used for advertising,
religion is not much seen or heard, though a deep faith is part of the
romanticised rural personality. The local shrine is overgrown - one
afternoon, a worshipper had placed a handful of rice and a glass of sake as
offerings to the gods. The shared spiritual experiences are supporting the
local high school in a national baseball tournament, and watching the most
popular gaudy gameshows, which lack the historical texture of the silent
black-and-white photographs in most homes.
The faded black-and-white photograph behind Kazumi Hirata is of him in
uniform. Sitting upright, proud but not arrogant, the 78-year-old told of
his war years in China and Taiwan. He followed the Yangtze River from
Shanghai to Wuhan in central China during the early days of the 1937 war. It
is clear that he respects China, and he cursed gently when he could not
rouse his memory to produce a few sentences of the Chinese language.
On returning to Suye after the war, Hirata worked in the village office for
26 years, guiding the region through starvation to relative prosperity and
on to an era in which the country is reluctant to recognise its new self.
His family runs a small convenience store, and it is the word 'convenience'
that most strikes Hirata about modern Japan.
'It is easier. It is convenient and that's important. I don't know what
really what else to say. It was too hard in the past. Too much hardship.' He
has thought about the past a lot, but is too dignified to force opinions on
a visitor. The present amuses him. Political scandals make him smile gently.
He appears to have spent his retirement sagely contemplating the financial
farce of the late 1980s and the inevitable 'bubble' burst. For the
convenience store, 'our sales went up a little bit during the bubble years,
and they are now down a bit'.
For most of the village, the economy was up a bit and down a bit. The man
most affected is Mitsunobu Nonaka. He runs KM Clothing, with one sewing
factory in Suye and three elsewhere. His troubles are not bubble-related,
but from rapid economic growth in neighbouring countries: 'Three or four
years ago, there was no real threat from China because their products were
cheap, but of a much lower quality. Now they are using Japanese technology,
their workers are more skilled and the quality is high, but the labour cost
is about an eighth of ours."
On display in the KM factory, surrounded by rice paddys, is a small trophy
won by Nonaka's workers in a beach volleyball tournament. 'Well, it was
beach volley-ball, but it was played in a hall.' He was the team's coach and
has a reputation as a thoroughly modern manager, but the time will come when
he has to lay-off the volley-ball players. Other factories in the region
have already started firing: 'We have always been one or two workers short.
That has changed. From September we started to get calls from people who had
lost jobs at other factories. We can't help them.'
Nonaka is one of the U-turn generation. Educated in Tokyo, and a former
employee of the Tokyo railway and property group, he came back for family
reasons. The village elders are attempting to lure back more of his kind,
but the attractions of big city life are more in demand than Suye-style
solitude, and the sun-tanned, stylish Nonaka is a bit like the 'model
worker' of China, lauded but not imitated.
Suye people are generally modest in ambition, but they have noticed that the
folk of neighbouring Fukuda village somehow seem to get a larger cut of the
national budget each year. The reason is the influence of the legendary
Maehara brothers, Dansho and Tetsunojo, one a mayor, the other a monk.
Dansho, 72, studied in Tokyo and is said to have close contacts with the
important ministries, construction and finance. Tetsunojo, 69, is well-known
nationally in the Pure Land sect of Buddhism.
The monk is a touch distant, wandering around the room preoccupied with his
thoughts, while the mayor is definitely down to earth, discussing economic
strategies and the benefits of tourism in Fukada. After settling for long
enough to answer a question, Tetsunojo complained that 'new religions' and
sects have come into fashion, confusing the young, who have reached a level
of material comfort that makes them conscious of their spiritual poverty:
'What is the correct religion? That is the question in people's hearts'.
The question is all the more pressing, he says, because the Japanese think
of themselves as very spiritual, and yet corporate identity is stronger than
religious awareness. In the past, spirituality came with the rural culture,
but the end of communal work and play has left the Japanese isolated from
their traditions and from other villagers. He uses the word 'villager' to
mean all Japanese, and not a small village in the south.
However, Dansho is more concerned by concerned by a different kind of loss.
Young villagers are disappearing to work in Tokyo or Osaka, and he reckons
that the village's population will fall to 1,750 by 2000, down from 3,113 in
1955 and 2,133 in 1990. He is trying to make Fukada livelier and wealthier.
He is encouraging farmers to grow tobacco, and has apparently struck up a
useful relationship with Japan Tobacco, the Tokyo-based cigarette monopoly.
'You want to know why they do so well at Fukada? Dansho went to Tokyo
University.' There was no malice in the comment. Noriaki Tayama does not
appear capable of malice. He runs the Body Shop, a car repair and sale yard
in Suye, and has leased out a small plot of land used for rice cultivation.
Recession means that the Body Shop does more repairs, sells fewer cars, and
has more salesman dropping by looking for 'hot' customers: 'I used to ring
the car companies and say Mr So and So wants a car, send a salesman. Now the
salesmen come to me, about three a week, wanting to know about hot
customers, anyone about to get their licence, anyone with a sick, old car.'
Noriaki and his wife, Kazuko, have just come back from their first
international experience, a group tour to Hawaii with car repairers from
around Japan. They were impressed by the idyllic beauty of the tropical
landscape as the aircraft made its approach to the runway, and they boarded
the tour bus with a pleasant sense of anticipation.
Then, said Noriaki, the tour guide began her spiel: 'She said the streets
are dangerous and we should be careful not to wander off the main roads. We
should be extra careful at night and keep an eye on our possessions. She
said a lot of people have Aids. We got to the hotel, and the walls were so
thin we could hear the people in the next room. They could hear us, we
thought, so we had to whisper.'
After the pleasures of a week in Hawaii, returning to Suye village was a
relief because 'Japanese food is cheaper in Japan'. But, the inconveniences
of tour groups aside, Noriaki and Kazuko were comfortable with the cultural
journey. Their impressions, delivered with a self-effacing humour, were not
those of the mythical cultivator intimidated by a hunter-gatherer society,
but more those of Japanese speakers limited by their language in an English
environment.
In their own understated way, the Body Shop proprietors have come to terms
with the outside world, while the official keepers of Japanese culture are
determined to perpetuate the confusing myths of rural uniqueness. As Noriaki
Tayama explained: 'The village is not what it used to be, and we are not
what we used to be, but we are still part of Suye, we are Suye people.'

1939).

FT  15 MAY 93 / The Long View: Gold bug bites again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PENETRATING voice was unmistakeable, the glint in the eyes undimmed.
There was no escaping from the coffee lounge as he advanced. It was Fringe
Freddie, doubtless promoting yet another esoteric investment theme. Was it
my imagination, I wondered, or did the gold bracelet seem a little clunkier
this time.
Occasionally, I make the error of attending an investment seminar which is,
shall I say, just outside the mainstream. It is not, you understand, that I
really believe in Japanese candlestick charts, Professor Wheeler's 1000-year
drought rhythm, or even the triple conjunction of the Kondratieff, Juglar
and Kuznets cycles; but surely it does no harm to keep an open mind.
The last time I ran into Freddie at one of these gatherings, he was heavily
into the prophecies of Nostradamus. The International Harry Shultz Letter
had admitted that its forecast of a disastrous Californian earthquake for
May 8 1992 had been based upon a wrong interpretation of the mystic, but the
event definitely was scheduled for May 8 1993 instead.
This week, pointing out rudely that San Francisco seemed still to be there,
I challenged Freddie over falling for yet another failed prediction; but, as
usual, he had forgotten all about his past mistakes. He had been infected
once more by the oldest fever of all, the gold bug.
They were trying desperately to keep a lid on the gold price, he said, but
it was hopeless. 'They,' I gathered, were the central banks, such as the one
in Holland which dumped 400 tonnes at the end of last year at a price which
certainly does not look too clever now the gold price is up 12 per cent from
its low. Clearly, I was not going to escape without hearing about a global
conspiracy.
Did I not know this was the most fiscally irresponsible period in history?
ranted Freddie. The Americans were running a deficit of 5 per cent of GDP
and, despite the smokescreen of tax proposals, their national debt could
reach 80 per cent of GDP soon. Already, net interest payments were at 15 per
cent of federal spending and would soon spiral right out of control.
Europe was just as bad, and the ERM finally was collapsing. Germany's public
sector deficit was 8 per cent of GPD, the UK's ditto and even France,
previously financially prudent, was heading the same way, having budgeted
for a deficit of 4.5 per cent last Monday. The Japanese had been leant-on by
the Americans to launch their own state spending binge.
Just a minute, I protested: surely this could all be financed properly
through the bond markets. With a recession on, there was no shortage of
finance. Long-term interest rates had actually been falling around the
world, at least until a few weeks ago. Of course, governments would need to
raise taxes and cut their spending when the recovery began . . .
Freddie began positively jingling with excitement (the reason, I noticed,
being that he was actually wearing two gold bracelets). Britain's Newbury
by-election showed just what happened to governments that raised taxes, he
said. As for long-term interest rates, had I really failed totally to notice
what the Americans were doing? They were cutting their sales of long bonds
and shunting even more short-term debt into the banking system.
By keeping deposit rates very low, the Federal Reserve was inducing the
banks to hold vast quantities of short-term bonds on which they could make
an easy profit - much more easily than by lending to real businesses that
generated actual economic wealth. But a monumental re-financing problem was
piling up for a few years out. Moreover, the low money market rates were
undermining the dollar and helping to fuel inflation, which had started to
go up again.
It was true, I admitted, that the performance of the dollar had been
disappointing this year. Meanwhile, the yen was looking wildly over-priced
on fundamentals, sterling was dogged by a massive balance of payments
problem, and the European continental currencies were threatened by tumbling
German short-term interest rates. It was hard to see where to put your
money.
Precisely, said Freddie. We should get out of paper currencies altogether
and into gold, which the politicians could not debauch. Even the equity
markets were looking dangerous. The new record net inflow of Dollars 28.5bn
into US equity mutual funds in the first quarter of 1993 was a classic
contrarian signal. In the UK, there was a corresponding surge of Pounds
1.8bn into unit trusts, beating even the Pounds 1.7bn for the first quarter
of 1987. Professionals were getting out and amateurs were getting in.
I attempted to regain control of the conversation. It was true, I said, that
the fall in real interest rates had cut the cost of owning gold. Also,
surging demand from China had helped world bullion sales to jump nearly 25
per cent in the first quarter, year-on-year. But that was at very low price
levels and, even at this week's prices, you were showing a total loss since
1980 of 57 per cent in dollars and 80 per cent in yen. Take into account the
opportunity cost of interest foregone, plus the actual cost of storage and
insurance, and gold would have lost you more than 90 per cent of your
wealth.
Freddie was jingling again. I talked, he said, like a blinkered bank
manager, the sort who would be one of the very last holders of US Treasury
bonds, too busy looking at the juicy yield spread to notice the coming
default (just like at Olympia &amp; York). Governments were desperate to
suppress the gold price bubble because it would focus attention on rickety
banking systems and unsustainable fiscal deficits. But we were approaching
the point of no return.
With relief, I saw that a session on Fibonacci ratios was about to begin.
But later, funnily enough, I felt quite glad I had run into Freddie. I might
have heard the story from somebody else and taken it seriously.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Property Plus: Wanted: homes for sale: The market is picking
up, says Gerald Cadogan, but agents are short of quality properties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPRING BEGAN early this year in the UK housing market as buyers decided that
prices had bottomed out. Now the problem is that agents do not have enough
good houses to sell.
Vendors may expect houses of quality to achieve (or come very close to)
realistic guide prices, and sometimes may exceed them. But 'realistic' may
still mean 30 per cent in nominal terms below the heights of 1988-89.
The hard times that let a buyer lop Pounds 50,000 off an asking price are
vanishing fast, and the imbalance of demand and supply looks set to lead to
a rise in prices. But how great that rise will be, and when it will reach
different parts of the country, is debatable.
In truth, the frosts that have nipped the green shoots of economic spring in
the chancellor's garden for the past 18 months may still return. In this
flux, the individual property matters far more than market trends.
Shute House near Shaftesbury, in Dorset, with a magical garden designed by
Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe, was on the market for just five weeks when it went
for virtually the asking price of Pounds 1.25m after other, lesser, offers.
The cuts in interest rates have made mortgage payments cheaper than rent -
notably for first-time buyers, whom the building societies woo with special
terms and who are most likely to benefit from the abolition of stamp duty on
purchases below Pounds 60,000. Nationwide gives an average first-time price
of Pounds 39,645 for the first quarter of 1993, and Halifax one of Pounds
44,289.
This discrepancy may reflect differences of clientele seeking mortgages,
from whom they draw the data for their indices. Both building societies note
that first-time prices are significantly - 6.5 and 7.8 per cent - down on
the same quarter in 1992.
This new climate affects directly only younger Weekend FT readers, but it is
relevant for all as first-time buying starts a chain reaction, pushing
vendors a rung or two up the ladder. A recent survey by the Royal Institute
of Chartered Surveyors has noticed is starting to happen again.
In all sectors, many have grown tired of living in rented flats and now,
with mortgages cheaper than rent and incomes up, are eager for a property of
their own. Nationwide computes a house price-earnings ratio of 2.85 for the
first quarter of 1993, its lowest level since 1960, and estimates that
taking into account prices, earnings, interest rates and mortgage interest
tax relief, houses are now more affordable than they have been since 1966.
At the top end, lower asking prices and the fall of the pound have brought
foreign buyers to London, giving some lucky Londoners the wherewithal to buy
good houses for bringing up the family in the country. Higher share prices
are another plus.
Perhaps the market would have turned last autumn, if Black Wednesday had not
struck just when the new buying season was getting under way and clobbered
everything from stately homes to new homes. Perhaps the mild winter gave
buyers itchy feet.
Whatever the reasons, there has been a change. From January to March,
Savills' Guildford office sold twice as many houses as in all 1992, Tommy de
Mallet Morgan reports. At Easter there was a pause, but now he detects a new
wave forming as vendors decide to sell and make their long-discussed,
long-deferred moves.
Two preliminary valuations a day is a sign of the activity waiting to
unfold. 'Just as Surrey led the way into the recession, so it is leading the
way out,' he says. More activity can quickly translate into higher prices,
and Morgan foresees a time not so far off when vendors may be tempted to ask
for a heady 5 per cent more than the realistic price.
In the present market, good houses sell. But if there are drawbacks (which
are more obvious now that the Property Misdescriptions Act is in force), or
if the house is overpriced, confidence is not yet so strong that any house
at all will be bought, as happened in the late 1980s.
Patrick Ramsay, of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, is cautious. For him the demand
has a slightly false bulge, as the eager but frustrated buyers include
flat-renters and overseas buyers, neither of whom have property to sell.
And spring last year and in 1991 turned out to be a false dawn. But the
stock of houses for sale is now low as the supply has shrunk steadily over
the last three years. Most of those that were on the market a long time are
now sold, at much reduced levels.
Some 'old chestnuts,' as Ian McConnel, of Savills in Banbury, Oxfordshire,
puts it, are still stuck. They were too high three years ago and, even if
they have followed the market down from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 220,000,
they are still too high, and buyers avoid them just because they have been
around so long.
So it is a two-tier market. In houses new on the market we may see prices
rise this summer, as country houses follow London's lead. But any rise,
Ramsay thinks, will level off in the autumn and winter as supply and demand
come into balance.
It is a matter of when the vendors have enough confidence to sell. The
shortage of top-class country houses shows many hanging on in the hope of a
better price and aiming to ride out such woes as Lloyd's and compulsory
early retirement. Some time over the next two years there should be plenty
of houses to sell, perhaps even from this autumn. If the market does rise
10-15 per cent, supply and demand will sort themselves out. But prices will
still be well below those of 1988-89.
Next summer may be a good time to sell, in the third year of the current
parliament. But who knows what new banana skins will be around by then?
After all, it may be safer to sell now since a vendor can be certain that
buyers will come to view, especially if the house receives national
advertising.
The handsome 1720s Much Hadham Hall, in Hertfordshire, rated Grade I and
probably the work of Nicholas Hawksmoor, came on the market two months ago.
Agents Mullucks Wells &amp; Associates had inquiries from Dubai, New York and
Stockholm, and a dozen serious viewers, four of whom made offers. Contracts
are expected to exchange shortly at a price close to the Pounds 950,000
guide price.
The Georgian Old Rectory at Thornby, in Northamptonshire, shows the ups and
downs of the market. In 1983 it went for Pounds 130,000. Restored and with
more land, it came on to the market again at over Pounds 500,000 in 1988 and
 -at the market's peak - went for over Pounds 550,000. This winter it was
sold again, dropping to more than the Pounds 450,000 guide price - sold to
an overseas company for whom it cost even less in foreign currency.
Realistic guide prices for good properties make sense, while competitive
bidding and premium prices remain rare and usually a reaction stemming from
frustration. If anything is wrong or the price too high, buyers still walk
away. How long they will remember the bruises of the past few years is
uncertain. If the experience of the price collapse in the mid-1970s is a
guide, memories are short and fear soon gives way to greed.
Yolande Barnes, of Savills Residential Research, expects marked price
increases between June 1993 and June 1994 - later in some areas - as vendors
comprehend buyers' pent-up desire to move and settle. At the end we may see
prices back to where they were five years ago in nominal terms, accompanied,
perhaps, by inflation - and higher interest rates.
In the meantime, if you are buying a house, do not overlook the
old-fashioned repayment mortgage which reduces the sum outstanding month by
month (although slowly at the beginning), rather than an endowment mortgage
with its lure of a lump sum at the end. The life insurance companies have
been cutting the returns on endowment policies. Conversely, anybody who has
paid the old way for the last five years has probably cleared off any
negative equity.
Keep in mind, as well, that agents are still cautious about prices, having
spent the last few years teaching vendors to think small. And there is a
danger that in their desire to obtain houses to sell, they may overvalue
them. It is a tricky market, and hard to foresee that it will ever return to
a frantic boom. What is certain is that any good house put up for sale now
will sell quickly.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Delors in talks with Kohl ahead of Danish referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACQUES Delors, president of the European Commission, has paid a discreet
visit to Bonn for talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, just five days before
the Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty on Tuesday.
EC officials described the talks, held on Thursday, as a routine diplomatic
exchange to prepare for the EC summit in Copenhagen next month, but the
low-profile trip suggests both sides are keen to co-ordinate their positions
in the event of a Danish No vote.
Opinion polls in Denmark yesterday showed the Yes vote strengthening its
lead slightly, although surveys failed to predict the narrow result against
the treaty in last June's referendum which triggered a wave of devaluations
in the European exchange rate mechanism.
A poll by Gallup Spain also indicated that the pro-Maastricht campaign might
be persuading more people to vote. The poll showed 50 per cent of those
surveyed voting Yes, 32 per cent No, 13 per cent are undecided and 5 per
cent unwilling to vote.
Senior EC officials this week expressed confidence that the Danes would
approve Maastricht and said there was no Brussels blueprint for dealing with
a No vote. 'There would be lots of recrimination, a wailing and gnashing of
teeth,' said one EC commissioner, 'but after the dust settled people would
look carefully at what they could do.'
Key EC personnel, including senior legal staff, have however been told to be
on stand-by to fly to Rome to attend the previously scheduled meeting of EC
foreign ministers on Wednesday. The following day, Chancellor Kohl is due to
meet Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain in either Aachen or Bonn.
Mr Delors, who was travelling in Italy yesterday, was due to return to
Brussels this weekend. He has remained aloof from the Danish referendum
campaign, acknowledging that attempts to swing the vote in favour of a Yes
would almost certainly backfire.
Mr Delors' talks with Chancellor Kohl are believed to have covered the
European economy and the poor outlook for growth. The Commission president
wants to make the EC 'growth package' as well as a broad discussion about
Europe's unemployment crisis a centrepiece of the Copenhagen summit.

The cloud hanging over Ladbroke got a little smaller yesterday. There were

FT  15 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: UK music industry
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If there really is something wrong with the pricing structure of the UK CD
market, then the national heritage committee did not find it. The Monopolies
and Mergers Commission may hope to do a better job. They should also aim to
devise a better solution than simply urging producers to cut their prices by
Pounds 2. But the MMC's earlier investigation found no evidence of collusion
or scale monopolies. Besides, it is hard to see what practical changes it
could propose.
Changes to the copyright law ending restrictions on parallel imports would
risk conflict with EC regulations. There must be doubt over whether such a
move would affect UK prices anyway - the evidence from other countries is
inconclusive. Multinational music companies, such as Thorn EMI and PolyGram,
will hardly be quaking in their boots. The UK market is lucrative but only
accounts for 8 per cent of global music sales. The top three UK retailers,
though, which control 53 per cent of the market and stand accused of not
exerting their buying power to the listener's benefit, will be less
sanguine. Whatever the MMC concludes, WH Smith, Woolworths and HMV face
consumer pressure for lower prices. Retailers' margins seem set to suffer
although higher volume sales and returning consumer confidence may soften
the blow.

FT  15 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Unilever
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market has developed something of an allergy to branded consumer goods
manufacturers due to the fuss surrounding Marlboro's swingeing price cuts.
Having already sneezed, Unilever's shares fell a further 4 per cent
yesterday following first-quarter results. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 420m
were towards the bottom end of expectations. But increased competition,
making life sticky for Unilever's Ragu pasta sources in the US, stirred up
fresh anxieties about brand strengths.
The market, though, is in danger of generalising from the particular. In
Marlboro's case, Philip Morris allowed its prices to grow wildly out of line
with discount brands. Ragu suffered as big competitors grew nasty trying to
enter a market Unilever had largely created.
The encroachments of private label will undoubtedly mean brand manufacturers
are going to have to run fast to justify their premium prices. But
Unilever's renewed emphasis on restrained price increases, marketing spend
and product innovation suggest it can still sprint with the best of them.
This makes its sub-market rating appear rather grudging.
Even if worries over brands do fade, Unilever's shares may still struggle to
reverse their recent underperformance. For many years, Unilever has been the
natural home for international investors seeking exposure to the European
food sector. The harmonisation of Nestle's share structure and its proposed
listing in the US suggest yet another competitive front will open up between
the two giants.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Volatility on Wall Street has frayed nerves in London over the past few
weeks, and with good reason. Equity markets around the world have leaped to
discount earnings recoveries unusually rapidly in the current cycle. That is
partly because of large falls in nominal short-term interest rates, which
have encouraged money into shares. But there is a danger of markets getting
ahead of themselves. The US is leading the recovery, so if valuations there
are excessive, there is plenty for the rest of the world to worry about.
By some measures - most notably yield - US shares are expensive. Ratings are
also high but reported earnings have been heavily depressed by write-offs
and may be as much as 25 per cent below the true operating figure. Those
write-offs are helping cut costs and, combined with investment, reduce the
threat of renewed inflation. US equities are not cheap, but they are not as
expensive as they may appear. What would turn the equity market decisively
would be a sharp move up in bond yields. Fortunately, that still looks some
way off, and the threat of a heavy fall on Wall Street is limited.
That should offer some reassurance to UK equities. There is, however, little
reason to expect a further substantial rally soon. An earnings recovery is
well discounted and the risk is of disappointing economic news before the
next corporate reporting season in September. To alleviate the boredom, some
will doubtless consider moving from recovery stocks which have come too far
to sectors such as stores which are nearer to consumers and have been left
behind in the rush.

THE UK music industry is to be investigated by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission after Sir Bryan Carsberg, director general of fair trading, said
yesterday he was not satisfied with explanations given for the high price of
compact discs.
Sir Bryan said he particularly wanted the commission to investigate whether
copyright law was being used to restrict or prevent competition. The law
allows music companies to prevent the import of CDs by retailers or
independent distributors.
The decision comes two days after a House of Commons national heritage
committee report which said that while it had 'found no evidence of formal
or overt collusion, it considers that the major record companies and the
retailers are effectively cartels, and indeed partly interlocking cartels.'
Sir Bryan told the committee's hearings last month that he thought the music
industry merited further investigation even though Sir Gordon Borrie, his
predecessor, had said last year that CD prices reflected what consumers were
willing to pay.
Sir Bryan said yesterday evidence to the committee and its subsequent report
had confirmed his view that an MMC inquiry was needed. He added: 'Compact
disc prices remain relatively high when compared with the cost of other
formats and with prices in the US. I have not been satisfied by the
arguments put forward to explain this phenomenon.'
The Consumers' Association, which has campaigned for lower CD prices for
years, welcomed the announcement.
Music companies, which expected an inquiry, said they welcomed the
opportunity to put their case to the commission, saying they thought it
would be more objective than the heritage committee and its Labour chairman,
Mr Gerald Kaufman.
Mr John Deacon, director-general of the British Phonographic Industry, which
represents UK music companies, said: 'We are confident we will be able to
demonstrate the remarkable value of the British music industry to this
country, both commercially and creatively.
'Following the blatantly prejudiced attitude of the Kaufman committee
towards this industry we will now take opportunity to put our case to
unbiased professionals who have a reputation for impartiality.'

FT  15 MAY 93 / Norway to defy ban on whaling: Decision by Oslo may
complicate attempts to join Community

NORWAY said yesterday it would resume commercial whaling within the next few
weeks in defiance of a decision by the International Whaling Commission to
maintain the ban.
The UK and other nations opposed to commercial whaling had claimed victory
yesterday at the IWC's annual meeting in Kyoto, Japan. But both Japan and
Norway claim that scientific evidence supports resumed whaling.
Last night the European Community criticised Norway for its plan to resume
whaling. 'We have international laws and regulations and . . . these should
be observed by everybody concerned,' said EC environment commissioner Yannis
Paleokrassas. He also repeated the Commission's view that whaling would
complicate Norway's bid to join the EC.
Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's prime minister, said yesterday whaling
would resume by the end of this month or in June. She criticised the IWC,
established five decades ago to maintain a balance between harvesting and
protection of whales, but said Norway would not leave the organisation. It
said quotas for traditional coastal whaling would be set next week.
She said that the IWC's decision not to support Norway's intention to resume
whaling further undermined its credibility as an international organisation
for natural resource management: 'The meeting in the IWC has confirmed there
exists a scientific basis to harvest the north-east Atlantic minke whale at
a sustainable level.'
Mr Jan Henry T Olsen, the fisheries minister, said that unless the growth of
minke whale stocks was controlled, they would consume the fish on which
endangered species depended.
Nations in favour of the ban argue that a relaxation could set in motion a
pattern of commercial catches that would seriously threaten the whale
population, which has been severely depleted by large-scale harvesting since
the IWC was formed in 1946.
Japan also complained that the IWC had become 'a body to protect the rights
of whales' and ignored a scientific report that cited no reason to ban
limited quotas.
Mr Kazuo Shima, head of Japan's delegation, said the outcome of the Kyoto
meeting was 'deplorable' as 'the efforts of the scientists were wasted'.
Both Japan and Norway hinted they might pull out in the next year unless
whaling was allowed.
Countries in favour of maintaining the commercial ban, introduced in 1982
and effective from 1987, were pleased that little progress was made on a
management plan which would pave the way for small commercial quotas of
minke whales in the north Atlantic and in the waters around Antarctica.

FT  15 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow restrained by economic
concerns
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US STOCK markets settled down yesterday after Thursday's big declines, but
continued worries about inflation and the economy meant prices ended largely
unchanged, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 4.98 at 3,443.81.
The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 0.32 higher at 439.55,
while the Amex composite finished down 0.45at 427.46, and the Nasdaq
composite 0.73 firmer at 676.37. Volume on the NYSE was 252m shares.
Prices opened flat as the markets digested the latest economic news - a 0.1
per cent increase in April industrial production.
The rise was slightly below expectations, and fuelled fears that the economy
is not growing fast enough to provide momentum for corporate earnings.
Investors were also still considering the implications of this week's bad
inflation news. Their greatest concern was that rising inflation might force
the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates, a move that could make
already expensive equities look even less attractive.
Equities were supported, however, by a stabilisation in bond prices, which
held their ground yesterday after two days of big declines. In late trading,
the benchmark 30-year bond was up  5/32 at 102 9/32 , and the yield was at
6.939 per cent.
Among individual stocks, banks, which fell sharply on Thursday, were again
weak on fears of higher interest rates. Citicorp fell Dollars 3/4 to Dollars
26 3/4 , Chemical gave up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 36 5/8 , Banc One eased
Dollars 1 to Dollars 51 1/2 , Chase Manhattan dropped Dollars  7/8 to
Dollars 29, Wells Fargo slipped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 101 3/4 and
Nationsbank fell Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 45 7/8 , all in heavy trading.
Some leading Dow stocks, however, more than held their own. AT&amp;T firmed
Dollars 1 to Dollars 54 7/8 , Coca-Cola rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 39 7/8
, Boeing put on Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 39 7/8 and Allied Signal rose
Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 64 1/8 .
Drug stocks were higher as a group, with Merck putting on Dollars  7/8 at
Dollars 37 1/4 , Pfizer adding Dollars 1 at Dollars 69 3/4 , Bristol-Myers
Squibb Dollars  1/2 higher at Dollars 59 3/8 and Johnson&amp;Johnson rising
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 43 1/4 .
General Motors fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 39 1/4 in volume of 1.5m shares on
the news that unfunded pension liability may increase by about Dollars 5bn
at year end, required a non-cash charge of Dollars 1.8bn. The most heavily
traded stock of the day by far was Royal Dutch Petroleum, which fell Dollars
2 1/2 to Dollars 90 3/4 in volume of 33m shares after the stock went
ex-dividend. The company declared a final dividend for 1992 of Dollars 2.68
a share. Canada
GAINS IN media and banking shares offset profit-taking in bullion shares and
pushed Toronto stocks higher at the close, dealers said. Gold shares, which
enjoyed a sharp rally earlier this week, suffered profit-taking as gold
prices finished lower. The TSE-300 index rose 11.99 points or 0.32 per cent,
to 3,813.33. Volume ended at 66.1m shares valued at CDollars 532.2m.

ARBITRAGE selling erased early gains and pushed equities into negative
territory for the fourth consecutive session, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average lost 82.42 to 20,474.15, up 0.7 per cent on the week,
after reaching a day's high of 20,670.52 and a low of 20,401.67. The Topix
index of all first section issues lost 5.35 to 1,605.71 and, in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.47 to 1,241.80.
Volume was estimated at 550m shares traded compared to 559m the previous
day. Declines led advances by 620 to 402, with 165 issues unchanged.
Turnover on the first section of the Tokyo stock exchange should decrease in
the coming week, with investors becoming cautious as more companies release
their results for the year to March.
Some brokers said that prices are likely to consolidate further on
profit-taking and on the use of futures contracts as a hedge against major
discrepancies between company forecasts and their pre-tax profit results.
Real estate shares lost ground in reaction to below-average earnings
results. Mitsubishi Estate, a leading housing company, dropped Y20 to
Y1,120, after recently announcing a 21.7 per cent decline in pre-tax profits
for the year to March. Mitsui Fudosan shed Y20 to Y1,380.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 98.11 lower at 22,790.47, in volume of 26.7m
shares.
Roundup
THERE were mixed performances from the regions markets yesterday.
MANILA gained ground as mining shares were lifted by the stronger world gold
price. The composite index ended 8.54 higher at 1,604.73, but down 3 per
cent on the week. Combined turnover rose to 556m pesos from 471m pesos.
Manila Electric's B shares gained 2.50 pesos to 322.50 pesos in turnover of
28m pesos.
AUSTRALIA was also supported by the rise in gold with the All Ordinaries
index up 4.1 at 1,698.5, a week's improvement of 0.7 per cent, in turnover
of ADollars 358.6m.
. The gold index soared 103.6 to 1752.0.
Among the miners Placer Pacific rose 30 cents to ADollars 2.57, Newcrest
Mining jumped 23 cents to ADollars 3.55 and North Flinders Mines soared 38
cents to ADollars 9.78.
ANZ shares fell 5 cents to ADollars 3.60 after it announced slightly lower
than expected net profit figures.
HONG KONG was sharply lower on profit-taking and pre-weekend position
squaring following a three-day rally. The Hang Seng index tumbled 103.47 to
7,005.29, a week's rise of 3 per cent.
Turnover eased to HKDollars 3bn from Thursday's HKDollars 7.5bn.
Property stocks were among the biggest fallers with Hongkong Land down 30
cents to HKDollars 15.20.
SINGAPORE staged a strong rebound from earlier profit-taking to close at a
new record high for the second straight day. The Straits Times industrial
index ended up 4.68 at 1,863.39, gaining 5 per cent on the week. Turnover
rose to SDollars 633m from SDollars 553m.
KUALA LUMPUR rose on strong buying of blue-chips, with the composite index
ending at a new record high as it put on 1.96 to 720.00, a gain of 1.1 per
cent. Turnover was 724m shares against 652m on Thursday.
Idris Hydraulic surged 26 cents to MDollars 3.48 on rumours that it had
secured a timber concession in China.
BOMBAY improved on reports that this year's monsoon would be normal. The BSE
index advanced 70.00 to 2,357.52.
BANGKOK was stronger for the fourth straight, although late-profit taking
eroded some of the earlier gains. The SET index gained 4.07 to 881.39, up
4.2 per cent on the week, in turnover of Bt5.7bn.
Construction material groups led the advance: Siam Cement jumped Bt14 to
Bt440 and Siam City Cement by Bt6.50 to Bt74.

FT  15 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Chicago returns to its 19th century
origins - The Midwest has had its day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Midwest Stock Exchange will go back to its 19th century roots and
re-assume the name 'Chicago' this summer, after a 45-year hiatus which has
seen America's second-largest stock exchange decline in stature and in
focus.
Its newly-installed chief executive, Mr Homer Livingston, believes that the
name 'Chicago Stock Exchange' more precisely locates the exchange in the
minds of international investors, and will associate his regional market
with the innovative reputations of Chicago's derivatives exchanges. 'Nobody
really knows where the Midwest is,' says Mr Livingston. 'Chicago is an
international financial centre and as the second oldest exchange in Chicago
(after the Chicago Board of Trade), we are an integral part of this
community.'
Geography and sentiment aside, the new name will also go a long way to put
some distance between the stock exchange, and an embarrasing scandal for
which it paid Dollars 2m in fines last year to the Securities and Exchange
Commission. However, it will do little to address the critical issues which
are vital to the MSE's survival. Organised in 1882 to trade securities in
local railroads, banks and energy companies, the MSE now trades in many of
the same stocks as the New York and American Stock Exchanges.
It survives by taking overflow orders from New York, specialising in block
trades and competing with the NYSE by offering lower prices, faster
executions, and better service. Its niche is a thin one, and threatens to be
eroded by technology and lower-priced competitors.
The MSE, along with other established US securities exchanges, is in a
fierce battle for market share with privately operated over-the-counter
exchanges. Relative newcomers like the New York-based Bernard L. Madoff
Investment Securities have managed in the last five years to capture 10 per
cent of the volume in New York stock exchange-listed stocks, at the expense
of the NYSE, MSE, and other regional exchanges. Known as the Third Market,
over-the-counter exchanges have entrepreneurial ownership and operate with
much lower overheads than traditional member-owned exchanges. They are also
subject to far fewer federal regulations, and frequently generate business
by paying their brokerage house customers for orders, a controversial
practice under scrutiny by the SEC.
In the last five years the MSE has seen its share of trading in NYSE-listed
stocks drop from 9.74 per cent to 7.92 per cent, while NASD-cleared market
share rose to 10.10 per cent, from 2.91 per cent. The NYSE's share of
trading in its own stocks dropped to 66.88 per cent, from 72.99 per cent.
Mr Livingston, who arrived at the exchange in January after a 25-year career
in banking, has attacked the competition head-on. In April the MSE slashed
its trading fees, offered to match NYSE and Amex prices on limit trades, and
will help its members, known as specialists, pay for orders.
The exchange cannot force its tradition-bound members to adopt aggressive
attitudes, but it has been putting competitive pressure on them by
publicising the specialists which are offering new services.
One month is hardly a test, but the new strategy appeared to succeed in
April. After seeing volume decline by 4 per cent in the first quarter, the
MSE's turnover jumped by 8 per cent in April to 275m shares. It remains to
be seen if the improvement can be sustained, and if the higher volumes can
be translated into higher profits.
The exchange is at a crucial juncture. Members' equity dropped to Dollars
20.4m last year, from Dollars 26.3m the year before, after a Dollars 10mn
property write-down and a one-time accounting charge turned a Dollars 3m
operating profit into a Dollars 5.8m loss.
Volume, at 2.97bn shares in 1992, was the second-best on record. Seat prices
also began to edge up last year, topping Dollars 40,000 for the first time
in four years, but remaining well below the 1987 high of Dollars 107,000.
The improvement, analysts say, is evidence that member and customer
confidence is returning following the SEC settlement over improper
accounting practices by two of its affiliates, Midwest Clearing and Midwest
Securities.
The subsidiaries, the SEC said, had, over a period of a decade, improperly
retained interest earnings on the deposits of the brokers who did business
with them. In a settlement last year, the Midwest paid the Dollars 2m fine
and agreed to jettison its long-time outside auditors and overhaul its
administrative staff.
As part of the blood-letting Mr John Weithers, the longstanding MSE
chairman, departed and Mr Livingston, a graduate of Princeton and of the
University of Chicago Law School, was hired to turn the exchange around.
Although this is his first foray into the securities business, Mr Livingston
appears well suited for the job, having earned a reputation in Chicago as a
bank rescue artist.
His business strategy for the exchange is simple. 'We are going to provide
cheaper, faster order delivery,' he says. In the long run, however, he
admits that the MSE's competitiveness will hinge on having a more level
regulatory playing field between private and SEC-regulated exchanges.

FT  15 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris weakens on devaluation
of peseta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER consideration of the Spanish devaluation moved Paris as a whole, and
individual sectors in Madrid, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS weakened in realisation that the devaluation of the peseta will have a
serious impact on exports, given that Spain is one its largest trading
partners. The CAC-40 index lost 28.19 or 1.5 per cent to 1,851.74, for a
decline of 1.4 per cent on the week. Turnover was FFr2.8bn.
There was also a weakening of the franc yesterday, making it less likely
that the government will be able to make additional rate cuts independently
of Germany. Further evidence that the economy is sliding deeper into
recession, and a fresh batch of weak first quarter corporate sales figures
left most analyst believing that the outlook for equities is bleak.
Hoare Govett, in its latest strategy paper, comments that the market is
looking vulnerable for a number of reasons: these include the likely rise in
demand for investment funds as a result of forthcoming privatisations, the
rising budget deficit and potential rights issues.
Carrefour and Promodes, both exposed to Spain, lost FFr14 and FFr16
respectively to FFr2,615 and FFr740.
MADRID extended Thursday's devaluation gains, Repsol putting on another
Pta145, or 4.6 per cent to Pta3,285 as the general index closed 2.08 higher
at 253.09, up 4.9 per cent on the week. Turnover eased from Thursday's
record Pta65bn, but stayed very high at Pta42.3bn.
Profit-taking appeared late in the day and, in a mixed banking sector,
Argentaria, Santander and Popular dropped Pta80 to Pta4,430, Pta50 to
Pta5,620 and Pta550 to Pta14,600 respectively.
However, there was general strength in utilities where, said Mr Peter
Stevens of BZW in Madrid, investors who worried on Thursday about the effect
of devaluation on the sector's foreign debt consoled themselves yesterday
with the thought that interest rates will be a lot lower in a year's time.
Sevillana rose Pta40 to Pta450, and Iberdrola Pta30 to Pta717.
FRANKFURT's DAX index bounced off a low of 1,629.57 after news of the
compromise agreement which has ended the east German metalworkers' strike,
but still closed 5.28 lower at 1,634.51, up 1.4 per cent on the week.
Turnover eased from DM6.6bn to DM6.3bn. Conflict in the car sector saw BMW,
ex a DM12.50 dividend, fall a net DM6 to DM456.50 and Volkswagen lose
another DM3.50 to DM318.50, but Daimler rise DM6.10 to DM564.40.
There was talk of a sell recommendation for VW from one broker while, in
Dusseldorf, Mr Eckhard Frahm of Merck Finck noted that the company still
topped the DAX performance list with a gain of 31.5 per cent this year.
Daimler had a presentation in Zurich on Thursday night and, apparently, is
sticking to earlier forecasts of profits down by a third this year; Mr Bob
Barber of James Capel, frankly surprised that the shares went up, said that
Capel expects Daimler's earnings to be down by two-thirds in 1993.
ZURICH ended a shade higher on strength in chemicals, the SMI index rising
3.3 to 2,186.0, up 1.0 per cent on the week, as Ciba registered led active
stocks with a gain of SFr9 to SFr626.
Brown Boveri produced the main results of the day. Mr Frederick Hasslauer of
Swiss Volksbank in Zurich said that they were at the lower end of
expectations. The bearers fell only SFr2 to SFr808, but this followed the
drop from a high of SFr837 earlier this week.
AMSTERDAM was disappointed at Unilever which came in with first quarter
figures below expectations. The shares weakened Fl 6.20 to Fl 196.30. The
CBS Tendency index lost 0.6 to 107.5, barely changed on the week.
Sentiment was also unsettled by a report from the ING bank forecasting that
manufacturing, transport and building companies, whose export potential has
been weakening recently because of the strength of the guilder, could show
an average 10 per cent fall in 1993 profits.
MILAN saw some profit-taking on the last day of the account although Stet
managed a solid rise, fixing up L105 or 3.7 per cent higher at L2,939, for a
rise on the week of nearly 12 per cent. The telecommunications group has
been supported by overseas interest, a positive profits forecast and renewed
talk about a strategic alliance with an international operator. The Comit
index slipped 1.45 to 538.99, slightly lower on the week.
STOCKHOLM rallied in the afternoon on interest rate hopes, the Affarsvarlden
general index finishing 9.40 higher at 1,081.50, 1.2 per cent up on the
week. Ericsson B finished unchanged at SKr300 after an early fall to SKr293,
the late recovery following a forecast of 'substantially' higher 1993 net
profits.
ISTANBUL fell back following recent strong gains with a decline in the
75-share index of 73.3 to 8,276.01.
Among the losers Eregli slipped TL50 to TL1,350.

FT  15 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Allied tumbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JEOL KIBAZO

<TEXT>
Drinks group Allied Lyons was marked back as old fears surfaced that a
rights issue would accompany its results next week. Other factors also
conspired to undermine the stock, including both the devaluation of the
Spanish peseta and dull European results from Grand Metropolitan.
However, Mr David Thompson at Kleinwort Benson said that the devaluation
would be beneficial to Allied and the rights issue story carried little
credence. More cautious analysts argued that the Grand Met results - and
those of other brewing groups this week - favoured a continuation of an
underweight stance across the sector. Cazenove was one broker said to have
reiterated its bearish stance yesterday.
Shares in Allied tumbled 13 to 545p on turnover of 3.6m. Grand Met declined
7 to 415p, Bass 9 to 525p, Scottish &amp; Newcastle 5 to 458p and Whitbread 6
1/2 to 481p.
After its much-publicised results on Thursday, British Telecom climbed 10
1/2 to 414 1/2 p in turnover of 13m. Dealers put the rise down to positive
comment, together with improving sentiment ahead of the BT III campaign to
sell the government's remaining stake in the company this month. The shares
have also underperformed on adverse news over US competition.
High street retailer Next continued to advance, the shares adding 3 to 167
1/2 p. While a number of brokers have turned positive recently on the back
of the consumer recovery, there have also been rumours that Next has been
eyeing potential targets. Austin Reed, steady at 233p, was one name
mentioned.
Hanson, which is set to announce flat first half profits of between Pounds
483m and Pounds 506m for the first half on Tuesday, lifted 2 to 240 1/2 p.
Further recovery in badly hit copper prices helped RTZ, the world's biggest
mining group to bounce 6 to 642p. Analysts added that the strike price for
RTZ's recent enhanced scrip dividend had been met, and marketmakers were
short.
The aggressive buying of Shell Transport which has surrounded the group's
well-received first quarter figures on Thursday, finally abated and the
shares eased 1 1/2 to 611p.
Zeneca, the soon to be independent bioscience arm of ICI continued
friendless and the unofficial 'grey' market price was marked down 12 to 636p
on thin turnover. Existing ICI shares fell 16 to 1263p.
National Westminster, which is to restructure its operations in France and
has announced that over the next 12 months it will pull out of retail
banking there altogether, gained 7 to 469p.
Condom manufacturer London International was weak on news that the Stock
Exchange had censured the group for not giving the market a revised profits
forecast which it revealed to selected analysts and institutional
shareholders. The shares, 10 lower the previous day, were a further penny
off at 185p.
Carlton Communications rose 8 to 727p following a buy recommendation based
on a trade press article which played down worries that pay-per-view cable
television would hit Carlton's home video market. There was further support
from SG Warburg which recommends the stock, arguing that the shares deserve
to hit 830p within the next three months. Finally, it was announced that the
Norwich Union had increased its stake to 4.04 per cent.
The Telegraph newspaper added 4 at 370p as it announced a first quarter
profits up to Pounds 9.1m from Pounds 5m.
Increasingly media-biased conglomerate Pearson rose 9 to 448p as the group,
which owns the Financial Times, gave a positive AGM statement.
Osprey Communications jumped 6 1/2 to 32 1/2 p on news of a radical
re-organisation of its business and a Pounds 1.3m one-for-three rights
issue.
Publisher Euromoney lifted 35 to 1023p, following strong results on
Thursday. However, more than 70 per cent of the shares are held by the Daily
Mail General Trust and the price moves sharply on small turnover.
GKN fell 6 to 434p, after Hoare Govett downgraded its current-year profits
forecast. Citing continued weakness in the group's European markets, Hoare
cut by Pounds 16m to Pounds 124m. The broker also reiterated its cautious
stance on Lucas Industries, 4 lighter at 139p.
Laird Group fell 13 to 280p after the chairman warned that operating profits
would be lower than last year.
News earlier in the week that VSEL Consortium had won a contract to build a
carrier for the British Navy continued to drive the shares forward and they
put on another 22 to 760p.
British Airways were wanted ahead of figures on Tuesday, though talk of a
rights issue lingered. The shares put on 4 1/2 to 303 1/2 p, in trade of
4.3m.

<TEXT>
Chemicals group BOC was marked up in early trading ahead of half-year
results next week. The firmness was maintained as several securities houses
reiterated buy recommendations.
The shares recorded a net rise of 17 to 693p following recent
underperformance. However, the turnover of 1.3m shares was unremarkable and
most of the rise was attributed to marketmakers covering short positions
following buy orders on Thursday. That squeeze on the stock was consolidated
as SG Warburg changed its stance to hold from 'long term reduce', arguing
that profits could be as much as Pounds 185m after Pounds 162.7m last time,
and NatWest reiterated its buy stance.

FT  15 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Unilever fails to please
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JEOL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIGNS of hesitancy in the US economic recovery and renewed fears over
the vulnerability of branded products combined to undermine Unilever, which
yesterday unveiled first-quarter results at the bottom of market
expectations. Analysts disclosed a swathe of moderate downgrades and
reported cautiously on their meetings with the company management. The
shares reacted accordingly, tumbling 40 to 1064p in turnover of 3.7m.
Some observers said the disappointment was fuelled by recent positive
reports from other US food groups, such as Nestle and Procter and Gamble.
Bearish sentiment also extended to growing concerns about Unilever's
European market being affected by recession, an issue linked to the
declining margins the group reported for that area.

FT  15 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK INDEX futures ended an active week by trading in a narrow 10-point
range for most of the day in a session lacking strong features, writes Joel
Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE 100 started trading at 2,849 and selling in
the first hour of business saw it driven down to 2,841.
June crept ahead better after that initial selling and traded around the
2,845 level for the rest of the morning. Stronger buying in the second half
of the session saw the contract reach the day's high of 2,865 but buyers ran
out of steam ahead of the close. The June contract closed at 2,859, around
the level of its previous close but some 6 points above its estimated fair
value premium to cash of about 5, with turnover reaching around 8,300
contracts.
In traded options volume was 27,986 contracts against a previous total of
34,727 lots. The FT-SE 100 option saw business of 7,747 lots and the Euro
FT-SE 100 2,807. BT was the busiest stock option at 2572 followed by Asda at
1,691 lots.

FT  15 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities easier in uncertain session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market rounded off a successful week yesterday with an
uncertain session which left share prices little changed from the close of
the previous day. London was again influenced by the New York market, easing
at first following the fall in the Dow overnight but rallying towards the
close when New York recovered 5 points early in its new session.
Concern over the international outlook deepened as Unilever shares reacted
badly to first-quarter results which disclosed that, despite good profits
overall, Europe and the US had lagged. Hopes for an early cut in UK base
rates appeared to fade somewhat in spite of a steadier performance by the
sterling rate index.
Traders said that a number of sizeable clients were in the market, on both
sides of the trading ledgers. BT, badly hit on the previous day, recovered
strongly in good turnover, reflecting in part demand for utility-type stocks
from the US. Transatlantic investors have reacted sharply to fears of
renewed inflation in the US economy.
This week has seen the stock market influenced strongly by stock index
futures dealings, often a reflection of uncertain investment sentiment. Seaq
business remained fairly high yesterday, totalling 620m shares compared with
797.6m on Thursday. Retail, or customer, business has held steady this week,
Thursday's value total settling at Pounds 1.57bn. The FT-SE Index closed
last night at 2,847, a net loss of 2.3 on the session after dipping to the
2,838 area in the first half of the session. Over the week, the Footsie has
risen by 53.3 points or around 1.9 per cent as the political misfortunes of
the UK government have been translated into hopes that these might force
cuts in UK base rates.
The second line stocks, which shared less significantly in the general
equity shakeout which followed the government's resounding setback in the UK
county council and an important by-election, have also made ground this
week.
At 3,142.3 last night, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index was 9.6 off on the day at
3,142.3. But the Mid 250 gained 1 per cent over the week and on Thursday
brushed its all-time trading peak of 3,156.9.
Trading volume in non-Footsie stocks, strong all week, dipped slightly
yesterday to make up only 58 per cent of the day's Seaq total, compared with
an average daily contribution of around 62 per cent.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Calm returns after realignment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SANDEEP DEOL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURBULENCE inside the European exchange rate mechanism subsided yesterday as
the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo stabilised on the currency markets
after their devaluations on Thursday, writes Sandeep Deol.
The ERM remained the focus of the market's attention, but pressures on both
currencies remained slight. The Spanish currency, which was devalued by 8
per cent on Thursday, closed in London today at Pta76.11 against the D-Mark
from a previous close of Pta76.33.
The Portugese escudo, which was forced into a 6.5 per cent devaluation,
ended the day at Esc96.35 against the D-Mark from a previous Esc96.65.
However, some currency analysts already believe that this week's realignment
will not staunch pressures on the Iberian currencies later this year.
Mr Keith Edmonds, International Economist at NatWest Markets, believes the
real test of the devaluations is yet to come. He suggested that the
devaluation of the peseta will prove to be 'inadequate' if the Government
hopes to reduce interest rates significantly. Spain yesterday reduced its
short-term interest rates by 1.5 per cent, to 11.5 per cent in the wake of
the devaluation.
Mr Ian Gunner, an economist at Chase Manhattan, disagreed. He expects the
peseta to be well-supported at present levels, allowing further interest
rate cuts.
He forecasts a 50 basis point easing in short term rates ahead of the
election, and nominal rates at 10 per cent in the next few months.
The D-Mark recouped some of the ground it had lost earlier in the week
following somewhat bearish comments on Thursday from the Bundesbank
President, Mr Helmut Schlesinger.
He said that the Bundesbank would do all it could to maintain confidence in
the D-Mark and that the central bank could not 'take a sledge-hammer to
German rates.' This dampened hopes of a large near-term easing in German
monetary policy.
As a result, the French franc finished slightly weaker yesterday at FFr3.373
per D-Mark against a previous FFr3.372. The dollar tested the DM1.61 level
against the German currency after the release of mildly positive economic
data. March industrial production rose 0.1 per cent, lower than forecasts
for 0.2 per cent, but still showing signs of moderate growth.
The pound was sidelined by a lack of fresh news, and saw some late buying
interest which allowed it to pick up more than a cent against the dollar, to
close at Dollars 1.385. It was up  1/4 pfennig against the D-Mark to close
at DM2.4650.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Money Markets: Iberians ease rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH the Spanish and Portuguese central banks cut their official short-term
interest rates yesterday following the devaluations of both the peseta and
escudo on Thursday, writes James Blitz.
The Bank of Spain cut its key 10-day repo rate by 150 basis points to 11.5
per cent, while the Bank of Portugal cut its key 'mop up' rate by 200 basis
points from 17 per cent to 15 per cent.
Both moves led to substantial cut in money market rates. Three-month
interest rates in Spanish pesetas were quoted at about 7.64 per cent late
yesterday, having been at 12.62 per cent late on Thursday.
In Europe, however, there was a more muted reaction, following cuts in
interest rates in both France and Germany earlier in the week.
Short-dated French franc futures rose yesterday, retracing some of the
bullishness about rate cuts that had been seen on Thursday, following the
Bank of France's 25 basis point cut in its intervention rate.
The June French franc contract closed at 92.64 yesterday, some 7 basis
points down on the day. The September French franc contract also closed at
92.34, down 6 basis points on the day.
Interest rates in the French franc cash market rose, with 3-month French
francs finishing at 7.50 per cent, some 15 basis points up on the day.
In Germany, conditions in the cash market were a good deal tighter as the
Bundesbank continued to withdraw funds from the money market with currency
repurchase operations.
Dealers said that call money had been as high as 7.80 per cent, with a few
reporting transactions as high as 8.00 per cent. This compared with a rate
of 8 per cent on Thursday. The Bundesbank said on Thursday that its draining
operations were aimed at correcting exaggerated market expectations about an
interest rate cut.
In the sterling interbank market, the overnight rate fell to around 4 per
cent after the remainder of a Pounds 1bn shortage was removed in afternoon
operations.
However, 3-month money firmed, to finish the week at around 6 per cent from
a previous 5 15/16 per cent. Dealers took the view that the prospect of a
reduction in base rates in response to the government's political
difficulties had probably diminished.

SANDVIK, the Swedish speciality steel and engineering group, stands by a
prediction of improved results for 1993 following a 3 per cent rise in
first-quarter profits to SKr486m (USDollars 65.76m).
The company said the downturn in European demand was more severe than
expected but this was offset by a further weakening of the krona.
Sales rose 27 per cent to SKr5.27bn, thanks to the weak krona, but were down
3 per cent excluding exchange rate movements. Group orders rose to SKr5.66bn
from SKr4.48bn.
Last year Sandvik reported a SKr1.53bn profit, down 20 per cent on 1991's
SKr1.92bn.

MINEBEA, the world's leading maker of miniature bearings, reported a net
loss of Y64.8bn (Dollars 581m) for the six months ended March, following a
restructuring of its loss-making electronics operations.
The company, which made a Y2.1bn profit for the same period last year, said
sales rose 7 per cent to Y105bn, while pre-tax profit was 4 per cent higher
Y4.17bn. It will suspend dividend payments for the first time since 1965.
Minebea is now paying the price for an erratic diversification programme
which included a door-to-door cosmetics company, a semiconductor business,
and pig farms, all of which proved unsuccessful.
Sales of bearings and some electronics products have improved with a
recovery in computer demand in the US, while the sale of NMB Semiconductor,
to Nippon Steel should help to clear the balance sheet. First-half accounts
included a special loss of Y54bn related to that sale.
The company hopes the recovery in stock prices and a recently-announced
government spending package will stimulate domestic capital spending.
Minebea forecasts a 4.5 per cent rise in full-year sales to Y210bn, and 3
per cent growth in pre-tax profit to Y8.5bn.
Omron, a maker of control equipment, says pre-tax profits fell 48 per cent
to Y7bn in 1992-93.

JOHN FAIRFAX, the Australian publishing group in which Mr Conrad Black and
Mr Kerry Packer have significant holdings, boosted profits before tax and
interest by about 30 per cent to ADollars 120.95m (USDollars 86.3m). in the
nine months to end-March, Reuter reports.
Fairfax, relisted on the stock exchange a year ago, said there were no
formal comparative figures but thought it appropriate to compare results.
Net profit was ADollars 47.4m. Advertising and circulation revenues rose
while costs were held at about 1992 levels.
Operating revenue rose to ADollars 568.01m from ADollars 539.24m in the same
period last year.
Mr Black's Telegraph owns 15 per cent of Fairfax and has government approval
to move to 25 per cent. Mr Packer controls 10.45 per cent.

FT  15 MAY 93 / International Company News: Petrofina plans BFr10bn asset
sales and job cuts

<TEXT>
PETROFINA, the oil group which is one of Belgium's largest industrial
companies, is to cut further jobs across all sectors and sell BFr10bn
(Dollars 301m) of assets in an effort to improve profitability.
Mr Francois Cornelis, the group's vice-chairman and managing director, told
shareholders at yesterday's annual meeting that this was not be a pleasant
task but would substantially improve the performance of the company.
Petrofina was forced to cut its dividend this year for the first time since
1959 after consolidated profits fell by 72 per cent, from BFr16.3bn in 1991
to BFr4.6bn in 1992, hit by low crude prices and the unfavourable dollar
exchange rate.
At a press conference before the shareholder meeting, Mr Cornelis said
personnel would be reduced by about 5 per cent this year - a cut of more
than 750 jobs out of a workforce of 15,490 at the end of 1992. The number of
employees has already come down from 17,131 in 1991.
The cash earned from asset sales will include money already raised from the
sale of shares in Tractebel, the Belgian utility company, plus the sale of
undeveloped reserves in the North Sea and US reserves, which are proving
slow to bear fruit.
Mr Cornelis told shareholders that profits for 1993 should improve on 1992
if the price of crude oil and gas remained stable.
First-half net profits are likely to be roughly the same as in 1992, when
they reached BFr4.16bn, in spite of a strong improvement in refining and
petrochemical margins over the last month.
Petrofina has been at the centre of takeover speculation in the last few
months. Shareholders approved a series of proposals aimed at strengthening
the group's takeover defences.

<TEXT>
MR RUDOLF GRUBER, a leading figure in Austrian business circles, has
resigned as deputy chairman and a director of Creditanstalt-Bankverein, the
country's second largest bank.
Mr Gruber, who is chief executive of Energie-Versorgung Niederosterreich
(EVN), an energy utility, said he had stepped down because the necessary
basis of trust between directors had been broken.
The move follows criticism of his role in an abortive hostile bid two weeks
ago for control of Creditanstalt from a group of Austrian co-operative
banks. Mr Gruber was accused of disloyalty to his colleagues for helping
prepare the bid and not advising them of it.
He said yesterday he had acted in good faith, knowing the bank and the
Austrian government were looking for investors to buy out the government's
controlling stake.
He said he had only acted as an intermediary between the Raiffeisen
Zentralbank and the Austrian minister of finance, Mr Ferdinand Lacina. Mr
Gruber said that Mr Lacina had taken the responsibility for informing
Creditanstalt directors.
Mr Gruber intended only to step down as vice chairman but when two motions
were put to yesterday's Creditanstalt board meeting seeking his removal, he
resigned from the board as well.

FT  15 MAY 93 / International Company News: Dresdner Bank profits up by 15%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROUP operating profits at Dresdner Bank rose by 'around 15 per cent' in the
first four months of 1993, Mr Wolfgang Roller, the bank's outgoing chief
executive told shareholders yesterday.
At his last shareholders' meeting before Mr Jurgen Sarrazin takes over as
chief executive of Germany's second biggest bank, Mr Roller said that there
had been 'substantial' gains in the profits generated by own-account
securities trading and fee-based services.
Commission income grew by 20 per cent, he said, while interest income
remained steady over the four months. For the whole of 1992 total operating
profits rose 13.1 per cent to DM2.81bn (Dollars 1.7bn), as reported last
month.
Mr Roller gave no figures for the first third of the year but it is likely
that total operating profits were in the region of DM1.1bn for the period.
This is a 15 per cent increase on one third of last year's total profit -
the format the bank traditionally uses to calculate profit increases for
less than a full year.
Mr Roller said it was too early to draw definitive conclusions about the
result for the year as a whole. although he said that from today's
perspective profits would be 'good'.
He said the pattern of the early months was likely to be repeated over the
rest of the year, with 'restrained' growth in credit business offset by
growth in fee-earnings business.
The figures confirm that the German banking sector has made a good start to
1993 after a record 1992, as indicated earlier this month when Commerzbank,
Germany's third biggest bank, reported total operating profits up 25.2 per
cent to DM651m for the first quarter of the year.
The impetus for growth has come from good conditions in the German bond and
equity markets rather than strong lending. Credit business has slowed down
sharply, reflecting the delayed impact of the Bundesbank's tough interest
rate regime as well as the deterioration in the economy.
Moreover, the operating profits disclosed by the banks take no account of
the worsening credit environment in Germany which is giving rise to higher
provisioning for bad and doubtful debts.
BHF, the Frankfurt-based merchant bank, reported separately that partial
operating profits - excluding trading results - rose by 7 per cent in the
first four months of the year.

FT  15 MAY 93 / International Company News: Nissan Iberica losses deepen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES at Nissan Motor Iberica, the Japanese carmaker's Spanish subsidiary,
rose sharply to Pta11.1bn (Dollars 89.7m) in the first three months of the
year from Pta1.2bn in the corresponding period a year ago.
Nissan Motor confirmed yesterday that it is to inject Pta5.02bn in new
equity capital to strengthen the balance sheet of the majority-owned Spanish
subsidiary.
The new equity will raise Nissan's holding in Nissan Motor Iberica from 67.7
per cent to 70.3 per cent.
Nissan Motor Iberica, which suffered a loss of Pta14.37bn in the whole of
1992, said turnover had fallen by 22 per cent in the quarter to Pta32.35bn.
Sales volume, including domestic sales and exports, also fell by 22 per cent
to 18,552 units.
Nissan Iberica has been hit hard by the drastic fall in demand in Spain,
where sales of commercial vehicles declined in the first quarter by 40 per
cent and car sales by 37 per cent from a year earlier.
As part of a series of restructuring measures aimed at reducing losses
Nissan Iberica said that it was seeking:
to cut costs in vehicle assembly by 15 per cent this year and by 10 per cent
a year in both 1994 and 1995,
to reduce overhead costs 'drastically', and
to cut its indirect and salaried workforce by around 600 jobs or 15 per
cent.
The company's financial performance has also been burdened by heavy
investments in the development of new products and in the modernisation of
plant and equipment in the last two years totalling around Pta100bn.
Nissan is seeking to transform the offshoot from its role as a maker of
light and medium duty commercial vehicles chiefly for the domestic market,
into a producer of niche passenger vehicles to be sold across Europe.
Nissan Motor Iberica expects production to rise to around 90,000 this year
and to 130,000 in 1995 from 77,000 in 1992.

FT  15 MAY 93 / International Company News: Disposals help trim deficit at
Pirelli
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PIRELLI, the Italian tyres and cables manufacturer, took a further step
towards recovery yesterday with a reduced group net loss of L105bn (Dollars
68.6m) after minority interests for 1992, down from L566bn in 1991.
The figure for 1991 has been adjusted for disposals made as part of
Pirelli's policy of selling its non-core diversified products division.
Group sales rose slightly to L8,252bn from L8,145bn, while losses at the
parent company level shrank to L87bn from L424bn.
A substantial part of the loss reduction stemmed from extraordinary gains on
the sales of activities within the diversified products division.
However, Pirelli's basic operating performance also picked up, thanks to
heavy industrial restructuring, which reduced the number of its factories by
12 to 90 and sliced the workforce by 6,000. Operating profits rose by about
L100bn to L278bn, in spite of L108bn in additional depreciation charges.
The company, which is again passing its dividend, warned that market
conditions remained very difficult and repeated its commitment to continued
restructuring to improve competitiveness.
Recent disposals of non-core activities and the group's shares and option
rights in Continental, the German rival Pirelli tried to take over in
1990-91, will produce a one-off gain of about L150bn and reduce debts by
about L500bn this year.
Extraordinary items stemming from the asset sales produced a net gain of
L134bn in 1992, helping to lift group net earnings before restructuring
charges to a profit of L41bn.

RHONE-POULENC Rorer, the US healthcare arm of Rhone-Poulenc of France, has
settled a long-running dispute with Baxter International over the patents
for the manufacture of ultra-purified Factor VIII, a product for
haemophiliacs.
Under the agreement, Baxter will pay Rorer Dollars 105m for past and future
sales of its Factor VIII blood-clotting product. Rorer claimed in 1991 that
Baxter had infringed its patents.
Baxter receives a non-exclusive worldwide licence to manufacture the
treatment, but the group has agreed not to license or transfer the
technology to countries where RPR already has a patent.
Baxter has also signed a contract to supply Rorer with Factor VIII.
In February, Rorer settled a long-running dispute with Miles, Bayer of
Germany's US subsidiary, over Factor VIII. Terms were not disclosed.
A dispute with Chiron over the same product is still outstanding.
Ares-Serono, the human fertility drug specialist, reports a 7 per cent slide
in operating income to USDollars 35.4m on sales down 9 per cent to Dollars
180.6m, writes Ian Rodger from Zurich.
Mr Fabio Bertarelli, chief executive, said the industry was being affected
'by a variety of economic measures which are, in part, reducing healthcare
assistance to the patient'.
Net income from continuing operations increased by 1.9 per cent to Dollars
16.9m or Dollars 4.51 per share. Final profit of Dollars 44.7m in the
comparative period was enhanced by the Dollars 28.1m proceeds from the sale
of the group's over-the-counter business.

<TEXT>
ANZ GROUP, the big Australian bank, yesterday reported a 25.6 per cent
increase in net profits to ADollars 170.3m (USDollars 121m) for the six
months ended March 1993.
For the whole of last year ANZ ran up net losses of ADollars 578m following
heavy provisions for bad loans.
Gross income for the first half of this year fell nearly 13 per cent to
ADollars 4.6bn but the bank is holding its dividend at 10 cents per share.
Mr Don Mercer, the chief executive officer, said the bank could look forward
to doing better than the latest results.
'Nevertheless, what we have achieved is not an unreasonable result, bringing
a 7 per cent return on shareholders' funds. It is also a first step back to
profits after the problems of 1991-92,' he said.
Net profit was helped by a reduction in the provision for bad and doubtful
debts to ADollars 377m. During the previous six months ended September 1992,
provision for bad debt was ADollars 1.2bn.
There was overall improvement in the performance of the group's divisions,
with the Australian business banking operations reducing losses to ADollars
33.5m from ADollars 73m in the same period last year. Esanda, the financing
arm, turned around from a loss of ADollars 33.8m to a net profit of ADollars
13.4m.
International banking suffered a slight setback, with net profit in the
division declining to ADollars 82m from ADollars 96.4m.
Non-accrual or problem loans have fallen to ADollars 2.73bn from ADollars
3.53bn since the end of the financial year.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Gold market bulls return
in force
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER TAKING a well-earned rest in the early part of this week the
international speculators who had driven the gold price ever higher over the
past few weeks returned to the market on Thursday refreshed and raring to
go. And they quickly made their presence felt. The London bullion market
price, which had eased back 65 US cents from the nine-month high reached at
the end of last week, ended the day Dollars 12 higher at a 17-month high of
Dollars 369.15 a troy ounce.
There was an overnight retracement and yesterday's London opening was at
Dollars 366.50 an ounce, but by the close it had moved up again to Dollars
367.80.
The renewed surge, which took gold's price rise over the past three weeks to
nearly Dollars 24, was greeted with little enthusiasm among market
professionals. 'The market is explosive. It has lost contact with reality,'
was the comment of one dealer.
The bullish bug that has infected the gold speculators was contracted three
weeks ago after they heard that Mr George Soros, the financier who made a
fortune last autumn by betting against sterling and the Italian lira, had
bought Dollars 400m worth of shares in Newmont Mining, the biggest US gold
producer from Sir James Goldsmith, who had used some of the money to
purchase options to buy physical gold. It was revealed this week that Sir
James had sold another substantial tranche of his Newmont stake.
Analysts have pointed out repeatedly that the physical supply/demand
situation does not justify the recent advance but their voices have been
drowned in the clamour of the chartists. Even before Thursday's leap Ms
Rhona O'Connell of Williams de Broe Mining Research was counselling caution.
'The underlying fundamentals should start to bring some order back into
proceedings at this level,' she said, '. . .but the fund managers have got
the bit between their teeth.'
'It will all end in tears,' said Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch
financial services group. But he conceded that the weight of fund buying and
covering by options granters could in the meantime push the gold price 'to
virtually any level'.
Silver followed gold upwards, ending nine cents up on the week at 444.50 an
ounce, but platinum lost Dollars 2.50 on balance at Dollars 382,50 an ounce.
Lack of fundamental justification was also a matter for concern among
traders on London Metal Exchange copper market this week as they watched
prices stage a substantial rally from last week's 5 1/2 -year lows. The
three months delivery contract rose Pounds 105 over the first four days
(helped by a fall in sterling's value against the US dollar). But when it
bounced off resistance at the equivalent of Dollars 1,870 a tonne yesterday
morning consensus was quickly reached that the technical correction was over
and sellers piled in. By the close the three months price was down to Pounds
1,164.50 a tonne, up Pounds 35.75 on the week - but most of that rise was
attributable to the currency factor.
The sudden turnround in the copper prices soured sentiment in other LME
markets, notably zinc, which fell Dollars 34.25 on the day in the three
months position, which ended the week Dollars 43 down on balance at Dollars
864.50 a tonne. Dealers said the zinc market had already been suffering from
a deteriorating technical situation and yesterday's breach of support, first
at Dollars 1,115 and then at Dollars 1,000 a tonne, had triggered stop-loss
selling and panic liquidation.
Nickel prices fell back sharply after the steam was taken out of the market
by a warning on Tuesday that the LME was monitoring a developing squeeze
situation centred on the end of this year. As the cash position closed
yesterday at Dollars 5,687.50 a tonne, down Dollars 312.50 on the week
dealers said that talk was circulating that the European trader behind the
November/December tightness was unwinding his position.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange robusta coffee prices were
briefly boosted on Thursday by news that Colombia, the world's second
biggest coffee producer had set an effective minimum export price of 60
cents a lb, just above current nearby quotations on the New York coffee
market. But most of the London rise had been wiped out by the end of the day
as dealers discounted the significance of the news, and New York prices
actually finished the day lower.
Sentiment improved a little yesterday, however, when the Reuter news agency
reported that the Brazilian industry and commerce minister, Mr Jose Eduardo
Vieira, on a one-day trip to Colombia on May 23 to hold talks with President
Cesar Gaviria and Colombia's National Federation, would be taking with him a
proposal by the Inter-African Coffee Association that the Latin Americans
and Africans should co-operate in an effort 'to establish minimum coffee
prices on an international level'.
Brazil had not taken a position itself on the proposal, presented on
Wednesday by the organisation's secretary general, Mr Arega Worka, and the
Ivory Coast commodities minister, Mr Guy Alain Emmanuel Gauze, an official
said.
He also said that Mr Vieira had suggested that the African organisation
create a fund with contributions from each of the 25 member countries to
improve the quality of their coffee and that the African countries should
burn their 'low-quality stocks' to improve the overall quality.

FT  15 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Rights issue expected from BA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS is expected to launch a rights issue on Tuesday to raise up
to Pounds 400m when it reports its financial results for the year to the end
of March.
The capital injection is aimed at strengthening the balance sheet following
BA's recent series of strategic investments in other carriers at a time of
difficult trading in the airline industry.
BA is also likely to report a sharp fall in pre-tax profits for its 1992-93
financial year. Analysts are forecasting profits of between Pounds 180m and
Pounds 200m, compared with Pounds 284m the previous year.
The decline reflects the pressures the airline has faced from increased
competition and the recession which has lasted longer than expected.
However, BA has continued to buck the general airline industry trend. The
majority of its main competitors have reported heavy losses this year.
Western airlines have lost more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) on
international scheduled services in the last three years, according to
recent International Air Transport Association figures.
Losses for Europe's biggest airlines increased to Dollars 1.35bn last year
from Dollars 1.1bn in 1991, the Association of European Airlines, the trade
organisation grouping 23 European carriers, said yesterday.
At the same time, BA has pursued its expansionary strategy to become a
global airline by acquiring stakes in USAir, Qantas of Australia, TAT of
France and a regional German carrier. It has also absorbed the operations of
Dan Air, the UK regional carrier, and agreed this week to take over the
Plymouth-based Brymon regional carrier.
BA last night declined to comment on the rights issue, saying only that it
constantly kept its financial position under review.
The cash call would help fund the total of between Pounds 500m and Pounds
600m BA is investing in its strategic airline partnerships and reduce
gearing, which stood at 46 per cent at the end of the third quarter.
The airline boosted its balance sheet last year with an after tax gain of
Pounds 140m from the sale of its aircraft engine overhaul plant in Wales to
General Electric of the US.
It also raised Pounds 320m from a convertible capital bond issue four years
ago when it planned to invest in a stake in United Airlines before the deal
with the US carrier collapsed.

FT  15 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Pittencrieff cash offer recommended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Aberdeen Petroleum yesterday recommended the hostile Pounds
8.7m cash offer from Pittencrieff.
It is believed the board decided to capitulate when it became apparent that
almost all the institutions had deserted the USM company following
Pittencrieff's decision to provide a cash alternative of 17p per share.
Pittencrieff's original 2-for-49 share offer valued the shares at about 15p.
And yesterday afternoon Pittencrieff announced it had picked up a further 9
per cent of Aberdeen's shares in the market, taking its holding to 48.5 per
cent.
Aberdeen is still rejecting the all-paper offer.
Pittencrieff's shares fell sharply last week following a warning that annual
profits would not meet expectations.
Aberdeen also announced yesterday that it had sold its 1.75m shares in
Aminex, the oil explorer, to Titan Assets for a price understood to be about
Pounds 100,000.
Earlier this year, Titan had backed Aberdeen's unsuccessful attempt to take
over Brabant Resources. The failure of the Brabant bid freed Pittencrieff to
make its offer.

FT  15 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Tadpole moves back into the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TADPOLE Technology, the high technology group, made a profit in the first
six months reversing the trend of earlier years.
Before tax the figure for the half year to March 31 amounted Pounds 26,800
compared with a deficit of Pounds 1.4m a year ago. Turnover rose from Pounds
4.6m to Pounds 8.9m and the order book at period end stood at Pounds 5.5m.
Earnings per share of 0.3p compared with previous losses of 15.9p. The
group, based in Cambridge in the UK and Austin, Texas, is not paying a
dividend following the practice of high technology companies in the US which
rarely pay dividends in their early years.
The shares closed 22p down at 307p, but Mr Robert Booth, finance director,
said there had been speculative buying in the weeks leading up to the
interim results and the price was now back at its usual level. Tadpole moved
from the over-the-counter market to a full listing in December last year at
65p a share and swiftly shot up to the 300p mark.
Tadpole is a specialist in printer circuit board design and manufacture. It
has managed to combine the elements of a Sun Sparc work group station - the
workhorse of technical computing - in a notebook sized package called the
Sparcbook.
Mr George Grey, chief executive, said the results reflected growth of
Sparcbook sales coupled with a good performance from the printed circuit
board division.
The directors intend to appoint US financial advisers with the objective of
moving towards an ADR listing.

FT  15 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Lonrho signs contract for Pounds 27m sale
of The Observer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO yesterday said it had signed a contract to sell The Observer
newspaper for Pounds 27m to the Guardian and Manchester Evening News. The
payment will be spread over two years.
The international trading group has also undertaken to indemnify the
purchaser of up to Pounds 5m in respect of redundancy costs incurred as a
result of the sale.
The Observer made a net loss of Pounds 8.7m in the year to September 30 1992
compared to a deficit of Pounds 14.9m.
Mr Jonathan Fenby, The Guardian's deputy editor, is to replace Mr Donald
Trelford as editor of Britain's oldest Sunday newspaper. He and Mr Peter
Preston, editor of The Guardian, plan to address The Observer's journalists
on Tuesday when they will be questioned about redundancies.
A Guardian executive yesterday said the Pounds 5m indemnity did not mean
that it planned big redundancies but would not comment further.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said he was considering
an application for consent to the transfer of The Observer newspaper without
a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry. He invited comments from
interested parties by May 21.
A transfer of ownership to GMEN requires the permission of the DTI under the
provisions of the Fair Trading Act relating to newspaper mergers.
Lonrho said the proceeds of the sale would be used to fund the redundancy
indemnity, the residual net liabilities of The Observer Limited and
subsidiaries and to further reduce overall borrowings of the group.
The deal represents a compromise between Lonrho's two joint chief
executives, Mr Dieter Bock, who was determined to sell The Observer, and Mr
Tiny Rowland, who has twice blocked attempts to sell it in the past year.
Since the sale was announced Lonrho's share price has risen by 29 1/2 p to
117 1/2 p, mainly reflecting the fact that the group has sold its biggest
loss-making asset.

Losses at Chiltern Radio rose from Pounds 179,000 to Pounds 325,000 pre-tax
for the six months ended March 31. For the full year to end-September 1992
the group incurred a deficit of Pounds 392,000.
The first half loss took account of an exceptional provision of Pounds

investment in Independent Radio News.
Turnover of Pounds 2.75m compared with Pounds 2.55m. Losses per share

rise

Sleepy Kids, the USM-quoted creator and developer of animated cartoons,
yesterday reported increased losses for 1991-92 and at the same time called
on shareholders for Pounds 1.2m.
The deficit for the 12 months to end-October widened from Pounds 155,927 to
Pounds 356,243 at the pre-tax level after taking account of exceptional
provisions of Pounds 170,251 (Pounds 58,079).
The fully underwritten rights issue is of 7.49m new ordinary shares at 18p.
The shares closed 1p lower at 26p.
Some Pounds 900,000 of the net proceeds of the issue will be used to fund
the group's participation in the production of the animated series of Budgie
the Little Helicopter.
The balance will provide additional working capital.
The directors expect the Budgie series, created from stories by the Duchess
of York, to be available by April 1994.
Negotiations for a production agreement have reached an advanced stage for
the animation of the series with Fred Wolf Films. It is proposed that Sleepy
Kids provide up to maximum Dollars 1.3m (Pounds 840,000) towards the overall
cost of production.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Appleby Westward Group, the USM-quoted company which distributes groceries
to Spar and VG outlets, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.28m
for the 52 weeks to February 28.
That represents a 22 per cent downturn from Pounds 1.64m for the previous 53
week period and was struck on sales of Pounds 70.7m against Pounds 72.9m.
Mr Roger Harvey, chairman, said the reduction in turnover reflected the
shorter reporting period and a fall in the number of accounts served.
A maintained final dividend of 5.8p is proposed for an improved 9p (8.8p)
total. The dividend is payable from earnings down from 20.7p to 15.7p.

PRE-TAX profits of Euromoney Publications increased by Pounds 1.32m to
Pounds 5.94m in the six months to the end of March. Turnover showed a 14 per
cent improvement, from Pounds 17.1m to Pounds 19.5m.
At the operating level, profits advanced from Pounds 3.71m to Pounds 4.43m
and associate undertakings contributed profits of Pounds 469,000 against a
deficit of Pounds 16,000 last time.
The pre-tax outcome included interest receivable of Pounds 1.04m (Pounds

Pounds 24m against Pounds 22m a year ago.
The company, 75 per cent- owned by the Daily Mail and General Trust,
publishes 44 magazines worldwide - a number of which had their most
successful first halves yet, the directors said, although Euromoney magazine
did less well than last year.
An interim dividend of 10.5p (8p) is being paid from earnings of 19.5p

FT  15 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Stake sale helps The Telegraph double to
Pounds 19m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Telegraph newspaper group, publisher of both the Daily and Sunday
Telegraph, reported pre-tax profits doubled at Pounds 19.1m in the three
months to March 31.
The result was helped by a Pounds 6.5m surplus on the sale of its 13 per
cent stake in the limited voting stock of Trinity International Holdings.
There was also Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 400,000) from interests in associates.
A higher tax rate resulted in a charge this time of Pounds 6.8m (Pounds
2.8m) leaving earnings per share of 9.1p (5p).
The company said that the effective tax rate for the present year would
exceed the standard rate of UK corporation tax because the rate applicable
to John Fairfax Holdings in Australia was higher.
The company holds a 14.7 per cent stake in Fairfax and on Thursday bought
options which if exercised would raise the holding to 15.3 per cent.
Turnover for the period was Pounds 62.4m (Pounds 58.6m).

FT  15 MAY 93 / UK Company News: BT defends payment of chairman's bonus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE a 36 per cent fall in annual pre-tax profits, British
Telecommunications announced on Thursday an unchanged 'performance-related'
bonus of Pounds 90,000 for Mr Iain Vallance, its chairman, prompting
questions about how the bonus was calculated.
BT said bonuses are set by a remuneration committee chaired by Mr Paul
Bosonnet, a non-executive director. The committee 'looks at a range of
considerations reflecting operational as well as financial achievement
against the targets that have been set'.
The committee decided that last year 'saw a strong management performance,
in particular delivering a good quality of service to customers while
cutting costs'. Furthermore, 'the profit figures were affected by a number
of special charges, particularly the cost of the redundancy programme'.
BT's recent quality of service report showed standards maintained or
improved in most areas. Its voluntary redundancy programme cost it Pounds
1.03bn over the year, and its profits had to bear a further Pounds 188m for
the repurchase of government bonds and for losses on the sale of
subsidiaries. Add that back in and pre-tax profits were 3.9 per cent up the
previous year.
On the other hand, turnover was 0.7 per cent down, volumes for inland calls
were static, the company lost about 2 to 3 percentage points of market
share.
Job losses yielded an 8.1 per cent fall in gross staff costs so that without
a single redundancy, profits would still have been sharply down.

FT  15 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Sheffield makes Pounds 52.9m acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHEFFIELD Insulations Group, the supplier of insulation products and
services, is to more than double in size by buying WMS Group for Pounds
52.9m, funded with a Pounds 49.9m rights issue.
WMS makes fittings for plastic windows and doors.
The 3-for-2 issue, priced at 135p, will reduce the roughly 54 per cent
holding of the Adsetts family - who will not take up their entitlements - to
about 20 per cent, making the stock more marketable. Sheffield's shares rose
5p to 176p.
More than 50 institutions had yesterday contacted brokers Panmure Gordon.
The issue, which is fully underwritten by Samuel Montagu, was more than
twice oversubscribed, a spokesman said.
Sheffield, which lifted profits by 95 per cent to Pounds 2.95m in 1992, said
capital gearing of 41 per cent would be less than 10 per cent following the
deal. It expects maintain the interim dividend at 1.8p and will propose a
same again final of 3.6p.
Pre-tax profits at WMS, whose products include knobs and locks for PVC-u
windows and doors, increased from Pounds 1.95m to Pounds 5.03m in the year
to August 1992 on turnover of Pounds 27.5m (Pounds 18.8m). The
consideration, to be satisfied with Pounds 47.1m cash and Pounds 5.8m in
shares, is based on warranted pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.5m for 1993.
WMS, which planned to float until owner Mr Joe Moore decided to sell
instead, has net assets of Pounds 11.1m, no borrowings and positive cash
flow. The company received three bids.
Mr Moore will hold 6 per cent of the company and has undertaken not to sell
his stake for a year. He has signed a 12-month service contract with
Sheffield. Mr David Kent, WMS chief executive, will join Sheffield's board.
About 65 per cent of the value of WMS's turnover is manufactured, to the
company's designs, in the Asia Pacific region, where wage costs average
between 20p and 40p an hour compared with a UK average of Pounds 4.50 an
hour.
Some 95 per cent of WMS's turnover is made overseas. WMS covers 75 per cent
of forecast currency requirements and is exposed to fluctuations.
Mr Tim Steer, smaller companies' analyst at stockbrokers Smith New Court,
said: 'WMS chairman, Joe Moore, is important to the company. He's the man
behind the successful Far East sourcing which no-one else in the UK does.
He's a bit of a taipan out there.'
He said the deal was priced at 12 times forecast earnings - which compared
favourably with competitor companies - but WMS must maintain operating
margins of 19 per cent.

FT  15 MAY 93 / UK Company News: BM distribution arm up for sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BM GROUP, the engineering concern in refinancing talks with bankers, is
preparing to shed all or part of its global distribution business in an
attempt to reduce the more than Pounds 105m debt.
The group, which has negotiated finance facilities until next month with a
consortium of 11 banks, is in talks with up to five parties. Discussions
ranged from an outright sale, dilution or the formation of joint ventures.
BM is understood to be talking to several Japanese companies, including
Hitachi, Marubeni - a trading house linked to Komatsu - and Tadano. These
three groups are already joint venture partners in BM's Australian
distribution business.
Executives of the group's UK distribution businesses are also seeking to
organise a management buy-out of the European operations.
Mr Howard Sutton, chief executive, denied that the banks had forced a sale.
'It is our intention and requirement to reduce the borrowing levels,' he
said. 'There is no timescale.'
BM distributes construction equipment around the world for manufacturers
such as Hitachi, Komastu and Ingersoll Rand. The businesses, which cover
North America, Europe, Africa and the Far East, have a net asset value of
Pounds 85.9m and total debt and financial commitments of Pounds 39.3m. The
construction equipment operations incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 600,000
on sales of Pounds 125m in the six months to December 31.
The sale of the distribution arm would include the Blackwood Hodge
businesses purchased for Pounds 54m in 1990. BM would be left with an
engineering business in the UK and US, with annual turnover of about Pounds
300m.
The group's shares closed last night firm at 24 1/2 p.

FT  15 MAY 93 / UK Company News: TSB closes 11 branches of Hill Samuel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The TSB Group's attempt to re-focus its Hill Samuel merchant banking arm
continued yesterday. It plans to close 11 Hill Samuel branches and transfer
most of their business into its retail banking network.
TSB is forming a commercial banking service, run from its 40 existing
banking centres. Relationships with small businesses at Hill Samuel branches
involving lending of less than Pounds 5m would be transferred to these
centres.
The bank has indicated that it would be willing to sell Hill Samuel if it
received the right offer. In the mean time it is attempting to refocus it on
merchant banking, and target companies with a net worth of Pounds 50m to
Pounds 500m.
TSB said that about 1,000 staff work in the Hill Samuel branches and the
retail bank's commercial banking centres. It is not yet sure whether
redundancies would result from the moves.
The closures will leave Hill Samuel with offices in London, Glasgow and
Birmingham.

FT  15 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Unilever rises 7% in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products company, yesterday reported
first quarter profits slightly below expectations and said its US sales were
affected by tight competition.
Pre-tax profits increased 7 per cent from Pounds 393m to Pounds 420m in the
three months to March 31. The results were affected by sterling's weakness
against the comparable period. Unilever said net profits, after tax and
minorities, increased 21 per cent in sterling terms but only 2 per cent in
guilders.
Turnover increased 7 per cent to Pounds 6.03bn, including a Pounds 112m gain
from acquisitions. Operating profits increased 6 per cent to Pounds 443m.
European operating profits fell Pounds 1m to Pounds 269m, which included
unexplained exceptionals of less than Pounds 10m.
North American profits increased 6 per cent to Pounds 18m. They were
adversely affected by increased marketing costs and a Pounds 4m charge for
post-retirement health care benefits, following a switch to the accruals
basis of accounting. The switch is likely to cost Pounds 20m for the full
year.
Operating profits from operations in the rest of the world increased 18 per
cent, helped by acquisitions, although margins slipped slightly to 10.3 per
cent.
Interest costs fell slightly from Pounds 39m to Pounds 31m, reflecting lower
interest rates and a fall in net borrowings from Pounds 1.7bn to Pounds
1.6bn. Earnings per share were 15.8p (13.09p).

FT  15 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Changes to FT London Share Service
statistics
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH EFFECT from next Tuesday, readers of the London Share Service pages
will start to notice a capital 'N' against the names of some companies.
The symbol indicates that the version of the company's earnings used in the
FT's price:earnings ratio and other statistical calculations have been
changed to the 'headline earnings' formula devised by a sub-committee of the
Institute for Investment Management &amp; Research (IIMR) and proposed in draft
form in early March.
The FT has chosen the formula proposed by IIMR because it represents the
broadest available consensus on a 'single number' treatment of earnings.
Although still subject to final review it constitutes the considered
response of the institutional investment community to the adoption by the
Accounting Standards Board of Financial Reporting Standard 3 on corporate
earnings (FRS 3).
UK companies will not be required to report their results in line with FRS 3
until after June 22. Many have already done so, however, and the Financial
Times has been taking full account of this for the past three months in its
company reporting.
We believe the number of companies complying with FRS 3 is now large enough
to justify using a new basis for earnings wherever it is required for
statistical purposes.
The aim of the IIMR headline earnings formula is to include a company's
actual activities during the reporting period, including those activities
which have been with the company only for part of the period. Key features
are:
All trading profits/losses are included in the earnings number. Items which
are abnormal in size or nature are included but should be flagged.
Profits and losses on the sale of fixed assets or of businesses should be
excluded. This does not apply to assets acquired for resale, such as
marketable securities.
Profits and losses arising in activities discontinued at some point in the
period, or in activities acquired at some point in the period, should remain
in the earnings figure. Costs of eliminating a discontinued operation, or of
making an acquisition, are excluded.
Although it will be surprising if we do not encounter difficulties with some
individual companies' figures, we are confident that the IIMR headline
earnings formula will provide a factual and robust basis for the statistical
calculations on which FT readers rely.
Further information on the FT's treatment of earnings is available from The
Manager, FT Statistics, One Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9HL.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Letter: Compact discs: consider other cases of over-pricing
 -and a market at work (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SELWYN WARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As the present controversy over transatlantic CD prices illustrates
markets can play strange tricks.
The canny shopper in New York can pick up video equipment for little more
than half the UK price. Visitors to Tokyo though will be shocked to find the
very same equipment - in its country of manufacture - selling at virtually
double the UK price.
Few of the goods which we buy and sell have an intrinsic unit value which
approaches the retail price in any market. That being the case, it is
unsurprising that goods (CDs included) will sell at whatever price the local
market will bear. This may be good news for the British record industry, but
it is only an example of the consumer voting with his cheque book.
That, surely, is what is meant by a market economy.

</HEADLINE>

   From M J PATRICK

<TEXT>
Sir, If we are to have a campaign against the restrictive practices which
cause over-pricing, why start with compact discs ('OFT may refer compact
disc industry for inquiry', April 30, Leading article and subsequent
articles)?
The costs of allegedly over-priced CDs pale into insignificance when
compared with the effects of many government-endorsed schemes.
Why not look first at motor vehicles (restrictions of Japanese imports) or
food (the Common Agricultural Policy)? After all, these represent a more
significant and essential part of most people's daily expenditure. CDs are a
luxury; no one has to buy them.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Letter: Asil Nadir preferable to administrators in running
company he created
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From J C H RHYS-BURGESS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Given the endemic prejudice and hostility in Britain against Mr Asil
Nadir, the absence of any balanced account in our press as to the reasons
behind Mr Nadir's flight to northern Cyprus was perhaps only to be expected.
However, the plea from Polly Peck administrators ('Administrators call on
Nadir to help strike deal on assets', May 13) for Mr Nadir to co-operate in
the further dismemberment of the company he created is breathtaking in its
audacity and hypocrisy.
It is alleged Mr Nadir has misappropriated Pounds 30m of company funds,
precipitating the crisis which led to the appointment of administrators.
Yet, to date, the administrators have taken for themselves and their lawyers
at least Pounds 16m in fees.
From your report, the rump of Polly Peck's assets in Turkey and Cyprus would
appear to have been owned through intermediate offshore holding companies
which are strictly unaffected by the parent company's insolvency and of
which Mr Nadir is either still a director or would seem to retain some
measure of control.
If this means these companies can now be wrested from the grasp of the
administrators, I am sure I would be one among many Polly Peck shareholders
who would welcome it.
While there may be some doubt about Mr Nadir's stewardship of Polly Peck's
assets, what is in no doubt at all is that UK insolvency law is a recipe for
its practitioners to plunder an insolvent company's assets with impunity.
Given a choice, I would on balance prefer our company to be run by the man
without whom it would not have existed, than by people who create nothing,
contribute nothing and do nothing except to trade for their own profit in
the misfortunes of others.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Letter: Europe's obsolete HDTV dream
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GERRY HINDE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Thank you for your common-sense leader regarding high definition
television standards for Europe ('High-cost TV', May 13).
Let's be absolutely clear. The prospects for a MAC-based future for UK
broadcasters died on the day BSB merged with Sky. With developments in the
digital transmission domain developing apace, it is obvious that the
technology is as wrong for Europe as the motives for establishing the
standard were misguided.
We talk optimistically about government efforts to reduce the level of
funding given to HDTV standards; but with nations across Europe so obviously
strapped for cash there is absolutely no benefit in propping up this
obsolete dream any longer. One more penny in extra funding is too much.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Victim of a class action: Social divisions are alive and
damaging the Tory party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If there is an attitude calculated to rouse the fury of Mr John Major it is
the condescension born of class-consciousness. So when Sir Norman Fowler
this week launched a public attack on the sniping from the 'patrician
tendency' at Mr Major's premiership, the Conservative party chairman was
speaking with his master's voice.
According to Sir Norman, in his speech to the Scottish Tory conference, Mr
Major had fallen victim to the prejudices of the self-appointed guardians in
the press of Britain's traditional class structure.
Put bluntly, the critics symbolised 'everything that brought this country
low during in the years before 1979 - the class division, prejudice and a
wholly blinkered and outdated view of the world'.
The immediate occasion of Sir Norman's attack was an article in The Times by
Lord Rees-Mogg which concluded in less-than-subtle terms that the
beleaguered Mr Major had been promoted above his station.
In tones reminiscent of an era when The Times was ironed by a butler before
being presented to the master of the house, Lord Rees-Mogg said that Mr
Major's natural place in politics was in the post of deputy chief whip
rather than in 10 Downing Street.
Mr Major was enraged. For him the article was the latest in a series of
personalised attacks which went beyond legitimate criticism of a long list
of government mistakes. He was being vilified not simply for getting it
wrong but because he had not been born into the ruling class.
Alongside Lord Rees-Mogg the targets of his anger are a group of journalists
at The Sunday Telegraph and The Spectator, both owned by the Canadian
enterpreneur and ardent admirer of Lady Thatcher, Mr Conrad Black.
At the top of Downing Street's roll of shame are Mr Charles Moore, the
editor of the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Simon Heffer, the deputy editor of the
Spectator, Mr Frank Johnson, a Sunday Telegraph columnist, and Mr Noel
Malcolm, a Spectator leader writer.
If there is a common thread to be drawn between them - aside from their
allegiance to Mr Black - it is an image of England and the United Kingdom
shaped by past greatness rather than present-day mediocrity.
They tend to be high Anglicans, although some may join the Church of Rome to
protest the ordination by Canterbury of women priests. Dr George Carey, the
Archbishop of Canterbury, is bracketed alongside Mr Major as a man who has
risen too far.
More important, their attachment to history and tradition has made them
passionate opponents of the Maastricht treaty. England, the mother of
parliaments, possesses still a political system and culture far superior to
those across the channel.
Mr Moore, who confesses publicly to membership of the 'highly-educated upper
middle classes', expanded his views in an article in The Spectator this week
under the headline: 'People find it embarrassing that this man is prime
minister.'
The style of Mr Major, judged 'the most demotic prime minister in our
history', was contrasted with that of the 'tall and distinguished-looking'
Mr Douglas Hurd. What a relief it was to have a foreign secretary (like Mr
Moore, an old Etonian) 'who is calm and dignified and can string a sentence
together'. Mr Moore and his colleagues are encouraged in such venom by the
certain knowledge that their barbs strike home. For that Mr Major has
himself to blame.
He has been over-sensitive about the press from the moment he entered
Downing Street - perhaps because during his meteoric rise during the 1980s
he managed to escape the opprobrium so frequently heaped on other members of
the government. Before he reached No 10 he was never in a job long enough to
pay for his mistakes.
Now his friends fret about his preoccupation with the newspapers, his
tendency - as he did after the publication of the Rees-Mogg article - to
pick up the telephone and complain directly to newspaper editors.
Nor can Mr Major pretend that he has not sought to make capital out of his
non-establishment antecedents. In 1990 the prime minister judged his humble
beginnings one of his principal political strengths. What better way for an
unpopular Tory party to reassert its relevance to the working classes than
to elect the boy from Brixton as its new leader.
Mr Major was quick to exploit the image. A subsequent pledge during the Tory
leadership election to create a 'classless' society was designed to
differentiate his candidacy from that of the aristocratic Mr Hurd. It
worked. Mr Hurd swapped his Savile Row suits for pullovers. But Mr Major had
won the point.
The prime minister's critics deny they are motivated by class prejudice.
They can point to the fact that the Tory party has not been led by a
patrician since Sir Alec Douglas-Home was replaced by Mr Edward Heath, a
grammar school boy, in 1964. And Mrs Thatcher, the daughter of a shop-owner,
won the adoration of those now attacking her successor.
Mr Moore says that it is Mr Major's lack of determination that drives his
attacks: 'Someone who has little formal education and no social connections
and has done well in politics would normally be a very clear and determined
character,' he told the FT. But 'he seems to be a very conformist,
conventional person who takes the establishment view on everything'.
Lord Rees-Mogg insists he is similarly uninterested in the fact that Mr
Major feels comfortable in motorway cafes and has not been known to hunt at
weekends: 'It's because of the chap that he is. If you think of John Major
in a non-political context he would not be a boss in any business.'
Maybe. There are plenty in the Tory party who lament the 'lack of grip' in
10 Downing Street. There are others who have always sniped at Mr Major's
less than polished social style.
But scanning the acres of newsprint devoted to personal attacks on the prime
minister it is hard to escape the feeling that for some he has become a
symbol of an admission they dare not make - that England, the United Kingdom
have swapped a glorious past for a second-rate future. The writers of this
article, though, must declare an interest. They both went to grammar
schools.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Letter: Perfection and emotion of Kodo Drummers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES MCAULEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I must question whether Anthony Thorncroft actually attended the
performance of Kodo Drummers (Arts, May 12) or whether his article was
compiled from reference to the programme only.
Perfection and emotion permeate the entire performance, and the solos that
use 'traditional instruments' such as flute and shamisen only serve to
highlight the truly musical qualities of the drums.
I appreciate that two hours of Japanese influenced rhythms may not appeal to
everyone, yet despite the power of the drums, which at times seemed to
re-regulate your heartbeat, none of the other members of the audience,
including a number of children, seemed to be remotely disturbed.
Reviews should be objective, but to intimate that this performance would
only be enjoyed by 'anyone interested in drumming' is insulting to the
cultural open-mindedness of the west.
Some may find it boring, but I doubt many will. If you are, you can always
leave.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Culture clash creates an endangered species: The viewpoints
at this week's international whaling conference in Kyoto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Japanese officials relate the history of the International Whaling
Commission, they tend to start the story in the early 1970s, when US troops
were entangled in the Vietnam war and Washington was looking for a fresh
issue on which to focus public opinion. That issue, the story goes, was the
plight of the whale.
The Japanese interpretation, coloured by a fondness for seeing the country
as a victim, is that a political conspiracy unfairly targeted the country's
'whaling culture', setting in motion an influential environmental movement,
represented in all its varied forms at the IWC's annual conference this week
at Kyoto.
Popular as this theory is in Japan, it tends to ignore the rapid depletion
of the world's whale population, mostly at the hands of large, aggressive
companies and not, as popularly portrayed, by feisty fishermen in rickety
boats. But the explanation does highlight that whales, slaughtered for oil,
bone and flesh, have provided a rich political harvest.
Political hustling, more than international co-operation was on display in
Kyoto. The IWC gathering was a forum spiced with conspiracy theories,
insults, rumours and vested interests, including those of Japan's far
right-wing groups which appeared in military-style uniforms to emphasise
their role as cultural defenders.
The 34 countries, which had gathered to draft a scientific framework for
whale management, were swayed as much by the latest opinion polls back home
as by the hard statistics on whale stocks. The UK representatives were aware
that the whaling issue produces 'mail bags of letters', and the Norwegian
delegation came armed with the threat that the country's fishing boats were
in the water, ready to resume the hunt.
Small countries with a marginal interest in the whaling issue raised their
hands in tandem with Tokyo, prompting allegations, denied by Japan, that
votes were bought with aid money. And countries with clout, such as China
and Russia, were reluctant to disagree openly with the US, which has taken
the strongest anti-whaling stance and departed from the principle of
'sustainable development', the controlled harvesting of natural resources.
Back in December 1946, before 'sustainable development' became a fashionable
phrase, an International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling was signed
in Washington, establishing the IWC's guiding principles. It stated that
'the history of whaling has seen over-fishing of one area after another and
of one species after another to such a degree that it is essential to
protect all species of whales from further over-fishing'.
But the IWC consistently failed to turn the early recognition of threat into
a coherent protection plan, balancing the survival of the species with
commercial harvesting. The Kyoto conference continued the decades-old debate
on a workable plan, drafting a 'revised management scheme' (RMS) to
supersede a 'revised management programme', which replaced a 'new management
procedure' in 1982.
In the past, whaling nations liberally interpreted these guidelines to
protect their influential fishing industries. For example, in 1963, Japanese
companies opened four land-based fishing stations in Antarctica, exploiting
a loophole in regulations limiting the number of boats which could be
dispatched from Japan. In 1993, the anti-whaling nations, in the majority,
are purposefully slowing debate on the RMS to block a return to commercial
whaling, effectively banned in 1987.
For these nations, the debate can continue indecisively for a few more
years, satisfying the anti-whaling voters at home, and avoiding a clear
decision denying the right to whale. The IWC scientific report did not give
a clear estimate of whale numbers and made no clear recommendations,
allowing both sides to cite its findings in support of the pro or anti case.
The anti-whaling nations succeeded in adding a proposal for a whale
sanctuary in the southern oceans to next year's agenda. The UK, which best
reflected the views of the anti-whaling group, explained that the government
'cannot even contemplate' an end to the ban until 'we are fully satisfied'
about whale numbers, a management structure, and the humaneness of killing
methods.
Responding to that argument, the Japanese delegation called for advice on
how to run a 'fox-hunt humanely' and how to 'kill kangaroos humanely' in
Australia.
But the Japanese and Norwegian representatives were most annoyed by the US,
which dropped the pretence of stalling on scientific grounds and opposed
commercial whaling under any circumstances, reflecting the tougher line on
environmental issues taken by the Clinton administration.
The US stance surprised some anti-whaling nations, as it is a departure from
the old debate over designing the right scientific model to chart whale
numbers and set appropriate catch quotas. It also departs from the concept
of sustainable development, and gives primacy to politics on the grounds
that, as the US delegation put it, 'we found no support among the US public
or Congress for the resumption of commercial whaling'.
By crossing the line of sustainable development, the US, which has done much
of the most useful research work on whaling, raises the possibility that
other environmental debates will be redirected to the political playing
field, with science a mere spectator. It also leaves the US open to
criticism that in protecting bio-diversity, it is ignoring cultural
diversity.
A Chinese delegate said the US statement was 'unfortunate' and would be
interpreted back in Beijing as a 'kind of imperialism' as the IWC's
scientific committee has found no reason to continue a ban on limited
harvesting around the Antarctic and in the north Atlantic. And Japanese
delegates were quick to interpret the decision as evidence of the cultural
prejudice of beef eaters.
When the conference closed last night, the Norwegian and Japanese
governments were hinting that they would withdraw from the IWC, and the
fishermen outside complained that the commission was 'humane to whales,
inhumane to people'. For the IWC, the most pressing issue may no longer be
sustainable development, but sustainable relations.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Letter: Proper bonus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID ACLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a private shareholder I am fed up with company directors
misappropriating my money. Inflated salaries and pensions are a scandal.
Very few companies are justified in paying their chief executives base
salaries over Pounds 250,000, and medium and small companies considerably
less. There is, however, general approval of properly constructed
performance-related bonus schemes in addition to base salary. These should
require the bonus, after deduction of tax at the marginal rate, to be
invested in the companies' shares and held by trustees for five years before
being handed to the beneficiary. This would restore identity of interest
between management and shareholders. On this basis good luck to management
and may they prosper.

FT  15 MAY 93 / System under strain yet again: David Marsh and Peter Norman
answer the questions you have always wanted to ask about the workings of the
ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cause of European economic and monetary union suffered a further setback
this week when the Spanish government on Thursday was forced to devalue the
peseta by 8 per cent. Portugal reluctantly devalued the escudo by 6.5 per
cent. European monetary officials were an hour into a long-planned meeting
in Brussels when Mr Manuel Conthe, director-general of the Spanish Treasury,
sprung the news that Madrid wanted a devaluation. The crisis in the Exchange
Rate Mechanism raised fresh questions about the future of Europe.
Why is the ERM in this mess?
After five realignments in the past eight months, the ERM is not fulfilling
its aim of forming a zone of monetary stability. Paradoxically, present
difficulties arise partly because the ERM was kept far too stable for 5 3/4
years up to the crisis in mid-September. Governments misguidedly saw the ERM
as a dress rehearsal for economic and monetary union (Emu). Unchanged
parities combined with high post-unity interest rates in Germany brought
down EC inflation, but also depressed EC growth. The strain of running tight
monetary policies to maintain over-valued currency rates at a time of
recession has proved too much for half the EC's 12 member states - resulting
in the split into 'hard' and 'soft' currency groups.
When is Britain likely to rejoin the ERM?
Not for quite a while. Mr John Major has made clear that re-entry won't take
place this year and Conservative MPs are in no mood to contemplate
membership even after that. The ERM may look more attractive, however, if
both Britain and Germany can achieve strong growth with low inflation.
What effect will the latest upset have on the European economy?
Could be positive. Continental Europe is in recession, with both Germany and
France expecting a fall in GDP this year. Any move that lowers interest
rates, as the Spanish devaluation has, should help activity in Spain and
elsewhere. Don't expect any dramatic improvement, however, until Germany -
Europe's powerhouse - begins to recover. That could take until the beginning
of next year, at least, given Germany's problems with inflation and
absorbing eastern Germany.
Will it have any effect on my mortgage rate?
Very unlikely. Continental interest rates have been dropping slowly since
March when the Bundesbank began to ease monetary policy. But UK base rates
had already fallen sharply to 6 per cent between sterling's departure from
the ERM last September and January. Some building societies have warned they
will not pass on further rate cuts to borrowers. With the UK economy growing
again, the Treasury is happy with the present rate structure.
Should I buy my holiday pesetas now, or hold out for another devaluation?
Spain goes to the polls with 23 per cent unemployment on June 6, so it may
be wise to see if there is a political upset. The market knows Spain wanted
a 10 per cent devaluation and had to be content with 8 per cent. Moreover,
the speculators made a profit from selling the peseta this week and may come
back for more at the first sign of political or social tension.
Is there a real danger of competitive devaluations throughout Europe?
Yes - especially if there is still no sign of an EC upturn by the autumn.
Exporters in the 'hard' EC members have suffered big declines in
competitiveness as a result of other EC currencies' devaluations of 15 per
cent or more since last autumn. As the table shows, nearly a quarter of
Germany's exports, and nearly a third of French exports, go to 'soft' EC
countries. French companies' impatience with the new right-wing government's
economic policies could rise if the economy remains depressed through the
winter.
Why can't governments and central banks stop all this?
Faced with an international foreign exchange market trading Dollars 1,000bn
a day, central banks' ability to counteract exchange rate movements is
highly limited. European central banks sold DM284bn between last June and
December to prop up currencies. But they failed to prevent the devaluation
or floating of eight currencies. With EC capital controls dismantled, and
most EC countries offering highly liquid markets in government bonds and
other financial instruments, international investors now have the freedom
and sophistication to switch huge sums.
How much money have central bankers lost from unrest since Black Wednesday?
A lot. In its failed bid to save the peseta, the Bank of Spain entered into
large and very expensive contracts to buy pesetas on the forward market
which will cause big losses. Britain is thought to have made a net loss of
more than Pounds 2bn as a result of Bank of England operations on and before
Black Wednesday. Even the Bundesbank lost more than DM1bn last September by
lending foreign currency to other central banks that was repaid in devalued
Ecu. The Bank of France may be one of the few winners because the successful
defence of the franc cost speculators Dollars 1bn.
Who are the speculators?
Basically, any company, institution or individual holding or wishing to hold
assets or debts denominated in currencies which come under ERM attack can be
a speculator. Investors seeking protection against the effects of
devaluation can turn to swaps, options and futures markets and set in train
moves that topple currencies. Such investors have been joined by aggressive
US-based hedge funds seeking big profits.
What does all this mean for European economic and monetary union?
Emu becomes still more uncertain. The monetary turbulence since September
has been accompanied by a sharp deterioration of the real economy in most EC
countries. Only Luxembourg is fulfilling the tough economic convergence
criteria laid down in the Maastricht treaty as a precondition for EC states
to take part in Emu. Because of this divergence, Emu by 1997, the first date
for union named in the treaty, is highly unlikely. The hard core may be
ready for union by 1999. But if they go ahead it will simply confirm that
the EC is developing at two or more speeds.
Is there any chance that France and Germany will agree to form monetary
union on their own?
A possibility often mooted and often denied by Paris and Bonn. A
Franco-German monetary union would be incompatible with Maastricht and the
Treaty of Rome, setting up the EC. But the two countries are certain to
extend existing co-operation and could jointly dominate an eventual union of
the hard-core countries.
What has Europe learned from recent monetary crises?
Governments and central banks have been forced to take a more realistic view
about the possibilities for maintaining parities of currencies viewed by the
markets as overvalued. Spain's decision to give up the fight against the
speculators again highlighted the difficulties dogging the Maastricht
process. The upset could strengthen the case of those who say Emu can only
work if there is a speedy 'locking' of currency rates of the 'hard' EC
countries. But this would require renegotiation of the Maastricht treaty. A
single European currency and central bank look a long way away.

FT  15 MAY 93 / More than their job's worth: Peter Martin examines the
irresistible rise of UK executives' pay and its effect on the morale of
middle managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Money is the Pleistocene layer of British business, the rich, deep mineral
deposit that lies buried under the top dressing of corporate strategy,
mission statements and quality circles.
Once a year, at annual report time, the surface layers give way, and the
secret bursts into view - for some people, business is a way of keeping body
and soul together; for others, it is a way of getting rich.
This year we learnt, for example, Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of
Prudential, received Pounds 769,000 last year in salary, pension
contribution and shares. Lord Wolfson, part-time chairman of Next, had a 68
per cent pay rise, to Pounds 168,000. Mr Peter Wood, who has created the
Direct Line insurance business for Royal Bank of Scotland, is likely to earn
more than Pounds 10m. Sir Anthony Tennant, retiring chairman of Guinness,
won a 24 per cent salary rise in his last year, to Pounds 777,000, plus an
annual top-up payment to take his pension to about Pounds 500,000, and two
years of consultancy at Pounds 50,000 a year. Michael Green, chairman of
Carlton Communications, got an 84 per cent pay rise, to Pounds 520,000.
These are the annual purse-baring rituals of spring. This year, however,
there has been a special edge to the public reaction, honed by low general
pay rises and some unusual, one-off arrangements.
If current share prices hold good, for example, 44 managers at LWT stand to
make Pounds 55m between them this autumn, thanks to a share purchase scheme
designed to keep them in their jobs during the television franchise round.
Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief executive of about-to-be-sundered ICI, will
celebrate a 31 per cent cut in the size of the company he runs with a 25 per
cent rise in his salary, to Pounds 425,000, and a bonus of between 50 and
100 per cent of final salary when he retires in 1995. And Mr Gerald Ronson,
the man responsible for the rise and fall of Heron International, has
persuaded the banks to let him have a five-year contract at an annual
index-linked salary of Pounds 500,000 for sorting out the mess he's stuck
them with.
A couple of decades ago, this surge of personal enrichment would have
provoked a left-versus-right political controversy - the working class
versus the toffs.
This time, the political and trade union response has been muted. Instead,
there has been a distant rumbling from the nameless, respectable legions of
middle managers and small shareholders, faithfully reflected in the columns
of the broadsheet press.
There is a statistical underpinning for this wailing from the suburbs. Over
the past 10 years, an FT survey shows, the boards of those companies which
have stayed in the FT-SE 100 index throughout the period have raised their
collective salaries by an average of 14 1/2 per cent a year, outstripping
the rise in the cost of living, the average salary, and their companies'
profits by a handsome margin (see chart).
Even when the economy has slowed, and the white-collar salariat has suffered
its first serious recession, the surge in directors' incomes has continued,
buoyed in part by the reporting this spring of bonuses paid in 1992 for
achievements in 1991 in meeting targets set as long ago as 1990. So far, 76
of the current FT-SE 100 members have published their salary and profits
details for financial years ending in 1992. Overall, they raised directors'
pay by 13 per cent during a period when profits fell by 7 per cent, the cost
of living rose by about 5 per cent and average earnings increased by roughly
7 per cent.
Mr Stefan Szymanski, assistant professor of economics at the London Business
School, has confirmed this trend in a broader, more statistically thorough,
study. During the boom, he says, there was a definite relationship between
rapidly increasing profits, and rises in board pay. During the recession,
however, this relationship broke down. Profits fell, but earnings stayed the
same - or kept on rising.
The rise in board salaries is starting to unsettle some of the people whose
studies are partly responsible for it - remuneration consultants such as Mr
Anthony Williams of Hay Management Consultants. Mr Williams thinks this
year's pay packets - to be reported next year - will at last start to show
the impact of the recession.
In the meantime, though, he understands a middle-manager's frustration. 'His
differential over the people below him hasn't increased as fast as the
directors' differential over him,' says Mr Williams. 'If you look at
before-tax - and, even more, after-tax - figures, the gap has widened quite
significantly over the past decade.'
The Institute of Directors, normally the most ardent advocate of
management's right to call the shots, is also perturbed. An audible note of
irritation creeps into the voice of Mr Blenyth Jenkins, the institute's
director of corporate affairs, when he talks about the subject. Partly he is
irritated at journalists for failing to recognise the delayed nature of
bonus payments and annual reports.
But mainly, he is exasperated that companies make too little effort to spell
out their remuneration policies, pay top people cost-of-living increases
which are not justified by performance, and cling to three-year rolling
service contracts which produce high pay-offs when an executive is asked to
leave.
Directors in small and medium-sized companies (average salary: Pounds
46,000) 'are at a loss to understand why these enormous salaries are paid',
says Mr Jenkins. 'The other source of irritation is when an individual runs
a company into the ground and is removed - and goes out leading the parade
with an enormous cheque.'
A new set of institute guidelines on pay, addressing these points, is due to
be approved by its policy committee next week.
Underlying the issue of executive pay lies one important trend. Much lower
marginal tax rates have made it worth paying higher salaries, because
executives, not the taxman, now reap the benefit. That has gone hand in hand
with a shift of perceptions. After a decade of Thatcherism, says Hay's Mr
Williams, people believe 'it's OK to make a lot of money'. This has led to a
general widening of differentials and an attempt to link pay more closely to
performance in every industry, at every level - and in the public service as
well. So why does the link seem to have broken down in large companies, at
least when it comes to a period of poor performance?
There are a number of possible reasons. One is the argument about lags
mentioned earlier; the second is that big British companies, by and large,
have managed to protect shareholders against the impact of recession
remarkably well; perhaps directors deserve extra pay for preventing a much
bigger profits slide?
The snag with this explanation is that it also applies to lower-level
workers. After all, in many companies, staff cuts have increased the
remaining employees' workload - yet they do not get director-sized pay
rises. And though the lags argument is also valid, the recession has gone on
so long that bosses' pay packets should surely be showing some impact by
now.
More convincing explanations revolve around a set of boardroom beliefs which
create irresistible upwards pressure on directors' pay:
The arithmetic fallacy. Every company wishes to be above average in the
terms and conditions it offers its top executives, to be sure of attracting
the best talent. Yet if everyone seeks to be above average, the average
spirals ever higher.
'I have only ever had one company say it wanted to pay below the median,'
says Hay's Mr Williams, who is frequently hired by boards to recommend
directors' pay.
The 'global manager'. There is a growing tendency to use international
comparisons as a benchmark for setting directors' pay, on the grounds
executives can now hop easily from one country to another in search of
higher pay. Yet only a tiny proportion of UK executives are capable of
building careers abroad. 'The chairman of one of the newly privatised water
companies isn't very quickly going to get a job in America,' says the
Institute of Directors' Blenyth Jenkins.
Process versus substance. Companies are increasingly setting up elaborate
structures for assessing directors' pay, spurred on by the Cadbury committee
on corporate governance and by shareholder pressure. Though these are often
rigorous and independent, it is not clear how effective they can be in this
sensitive area.
BAT Industries ('We were carrying out Cadbury before Cadbury had even, er,
melted') sets its directors' pay in a committee composed entirely of
non-executive directors. It gives each director a number of performance
targets, some of them 'hard' ones based on financial performance
(price/earnings ratio relative to rivals, market share, profitability), and
some of them softer and more judgmental.
Directors' salaries and bonuses are set in accordance with how well each has
done against his targets. Sir Patrick Sheehy, the chairman, earned Pounds
609,000 in pay and bonus in 1989, and Pounds 638,000 in 1991. Last year, his
salary and bonus rose 54 per cent, to Pounds 980,000 - an accompaniment,
says BAT's Michael Prideaux, to the group's 68 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits that year.
Yet BAT's profits in 1992 were still below the level reached in 1989, when
Sir Patrick's pay was 38 per cent lower than last year. Shareholders have
benefited in the meantime, of course, by the group's actions to spin off
assets and raise the dividend - but arguably Sir James Goldsmith, with his
aborted raid on the company's shares, deserves to share the credit there.
Mr Tony Greener, Guinness's new chairman, is one of the few bosses willing
to speak on the record about top pay policy. As with BAT, he stresses the
objectivity of the non-executive directors who set pay at Guinness.
Directors' bonuses are tied to 'hard' criteria, such as earnings-per-share
growth. The management commissions an outside survey and makes
recommendations, but there is then 'a very straightforward and open
discussion - they do not rubber-stamp anything. It's a dialogue rather than
a set of take-it-or-leave-it recommendations.'
Institutional shareholders are starting to take executive pay as an issue,
worried perhaps by the example of the US, where total board remuneration is
a significant figure in the profit and loss account of some companies. In
Britain, though the individual sums are large by comparison with average
wages - even average white-collar earnings - the total is not big enough to
worry shareholders directly.
It risks becoming so, however, if directors' pay drifts so far out of line
with ordinary managers' pay and with profitability as to damage morale and
performance inside the company. Deep in the Pleistocene layer, something
stirs . . .

FT  15 MAY 93 / Leading Article: A gleam in Asian eyes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD HAS always been a bolt hole for the nervous, and as this week's events
have demonstrated once again, there is never any shortage of things for
investors to be nervous about. The devaluation of the peseta within the
European exchange rate mechanism, the looming Danish referendum on
Maastricht, high-profile corporate bankruptcies such as at shipbuilders Swan
Hunter - the list can be compiled to suit all tastes in pessimism. Yet the
surge in the gold price to a 17-month high, and the simultaneous mid-week
plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average, were primarily attributable to
renewed fears of inflation. Rarely has investment opinion on the respective
risks of inflation and deflation been so polarised.
Last month investors subscribed for Dollars 175m worth of 50-year debentures
in aircraft manufacturer Boeing on a redemption yield of just under 8 per
cent, only 1 percentage point more than the yield on the US Treasury's
30-year bond. This implies not only a touching faith in price stability half
a century hence, but an even more touching belief in the durability of
companies - just when the troubles of giants such as IBM and Philips are
pointing to a shorter life cycle for corporate monoliths.
The steepness of the yield curve in the US, with short-dated paper as low as
3 per cent against long bonds yielding almost 7 per cent, admittedly makes
longer maturities attractive. But as the US newsletter Grant's Interest Rate
Observer puts it: 'In flight from 3 per cent, a person may buy a cat or a
dog instead of a yield.'
Or, in the present instance, a person may buy gold. Yet worries about
renewed global inflation look premature. In the US, where bond investors
twitched on Wednesday over a big increase in producer prices between March
and April, the figures for output, jobs and broad money still point to a
faltering recovery and minimal inflationary pressure. Japanese bond yields
of 4 1/2 per cent, even after the quarter point rise over the past month,
are not ringing inflationary alarm bells.
European doldrums
In Europe, meantime, the German and French economies will contract this
year. While Bundesbank officials warn loudly about inflation, the German
central bank's action on interest rates suggests mounting anxiety about
shrinkage in the real economy. Within that, countries such as the UK, with
its roller-coaster housing market, or Italy, with an overblown stock of
public-sector debt, clearly remain inflation-prone. Rising fiscal deficits
could also cause global trouble in the late 1990s. But this is not yet the
stuff of an enduring rally in the price of a commodity that Keynes dubbed
'the barbaric metal'.
The gold and gold futures markets are small compared with global bond
markets, and thus more susceptible to a ramp by large investors. But the
recent flurry also owes something to China, where a rapidly growing economy
is badly overheating. Estimates of urban inflation in China in the first
quarter of 1993 run close to 16 per cent, roughly double the probable
sustainable growth rate of the underlying economy. Yet liberalisation makes
it harder for the government in Beijing to slam on the brakes.
Chinese interest
Individual Chinese thus have an urgent need for a hedge. With only two
paltry domestic stock exchanges, local equities cannot do the job. Nor is it
easy for individuals to invest overseas. Gold, then, has a special
attraction for China's 1.2bn people, which is reflected in street prices for
the metal that exceed the world price by Dollars 200 or more. According to
the Gold Fields Minerals Services consultancy, China emerged last year as
the world's largest consumer of the precious metal.
The surge in the gold price, then, is partly a by-product of the
underdeveloped state of the mainland Chinese financial system. And since the
Chinese economy could now, on the IMF's latest purchasing power parity
estimates, be the world's third largest after the US and Japan, the pattern
of global portfolio demand is inevitably affected by this distortion. Nor
are such spillovers from the domestic into the global capital markets
anything new.
Distortions in the Japanese financial system, including a prohibition on
insurance companies from paying bonuses to policyholders out of capital
gains, explained the loss-making Japanese rush into high-yielding US bond
markets in the 1980s. The lifting of restrictions on foreign investment by
Swedish investment institutions prompted an equally unsuccessful invasion of
the London office property market around the same time, which has now been
followed by a similar and better-timed invasion by German institutions.
Clearly it helps if the domestic circumstance that precipitates a change in
overseas asset prices happens to coincide with a market trough. The
consolation for the Chinese is that the gold price, despite the ramp, is up
only 13 per cent on its low point this year; and at around Dollars 368 it
remains well below its 1980s peak of Dollars 835. But others should beware.
It is a volatile market that looks increasingly giddy.

TRANSMANCHE Link, the Anglo-French consortium building the Channel tunnel,
yesterday sought to distance itself from comments that the project might be
delayed until 1995 made earlier this week by Mr Philippe Montagner, the
consortium's vice-president.
TML said that his remarks had been misinterpreted. The contractors had told
Eurotunnel, the tunnel operator, that it might not open until the middle of
next year unless agreement could be reached on the contractor's claims for
additional payments.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Police call for research on drugs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR police officer has called for research into licensing users and
suppliers of illegal drugs.
Speaking on Thursday at the annual Association of Chief Police Officers'
drugs conference, Commander John Grieve of Scotland Yard said it was time
for police and government to 'think the unthinkable'.
Mr Grieve said the aim would be to cut crime against the elderly and
vulnerable. He also called for a national system of cautioning for a wide
range of drugs offences.
''However, it does mean research that might mean licensing some people to
possess, some people to use and some people to supply some, several or many
drugs,' he said.
His controversial proposals come after chairing a working group of 31 police
chiefs during the conference, nearly half of whom, he said, favoured at
least some research.

THE High Court has ruled that the judicial review sought by retailers Tesco
Stores and Texas Homecare, which claim they have been unfairly discriminated
against by councils enforcing laws banning Sunday trading, should be speeded
up. The review is likely to be heard next month.
The retailers are seeking a review on the grounds that they have been
unlawfully targeted and threatened with trading bans, while smaller
businesses are escaping legal action.
Mr Peter Lloyd, a Home Office minister, told the Commons yesterday that the
government would publish a bill in the next few weeks aimed at sorting out
the Sunday trading muddle.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Heseltine tries to rally Tory rank and file
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, yesterday assured
anxious Conservatives that they would weather the storms currently buffeting
the party.
He told Scottish Conservatives in Edinburgh: 'We are the party of
government, responsive to the public mood, not bowed by pressure . . . above
all a party man enough for the storms.
'We have weathered them before. We will come through to earn the reward. We
know there will be a better season.'
He urged Conservatives to display 'confidence without complacency'.
Mr Heseltine was speaking on the last day of the Scottish Tories'
conference, where the upbeat mood produced by last year's successes in the
general election north of the border contrasted with near panic among party
supporters further south after setbacks in local government elections and
the Newbury by-election.
Mr Heseltine attacked the party's Maastricht rebels, saying it was
'unthinkable that the party would let John Major down (over ratifying the
treaty) and deny him what we entrusted him to achieve'.
Mr Heseltine revealed that he had been asked by Mr Major to carry out an
assault on excessive regulation hampering British business. 'He said: swing
in there, lad, and act, before breakfast, before lunch, before tea and
before dinner. I didn't take much encouraging.'
Government departments had listed 7,000 regulations imposed on business,
though the number fell to 3,500 when the double counting of measures imposed
by two departments was eliminated.
Earlier Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, was warned that the proposed
privatisation of British Rail was a 'recipe for disaster.' Mr John Gall, a
retired train driver with 31 years' service, said: 'We don't require an
opposition. We've done their job for them.'
Mr Gall was the only speaker to express outright opposition to plans to
franchise some of British Rail's services to the private sector. Several
speakers voiced reservations, but others strongly backed the plan.
Mr MacGregor held out the prospect of a privatised ScotRail competing for
railway franchises in England after it had itself been franchised. ScotRail
is to be one of the first parts of British rail to be franchised. It is
widely believed the franchise will be won by its existing management through
a buy-out.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, rejected a call from the floor of
the conference to scrap Options for Change, the plan to scale down Britain's
defence forces after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact.
He argued that Options for Change had been drawn up before the Soviet Union
had collapsed and Russian troops moved 1,000 miles back from Europe. He had
to ensure that the British defence budget, which like other departments
faced public expenditure constraints, was adequate to ensure that British
forces had the best equipment.
He said no decision had been made on which of the two naval dockyards would
win the contract to refit Trident submarines, but that both Rosyth and
Devonport would remain in existence for many years.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Knives out for Lamont again: A lavish dinner laid on for the
MP for Kingston
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE end of one of the most difficult weeks in his political career, the
knives were out again for Mr Norman Lamont last night - this time in his
Kingston upon Thames constituency.
But for once the embattled chancellor appeared not to mind. The reason,
after all, was a lavish dinner given by his constituency party to celebrate
the 21st anniversary of his election as the local MP.
Mr Lamont said that of all the opponents he had faced in general elections,
the Monster Raving Loonies had produced the best manifestos. The
light-hearted tone of the occasion was enhanced by the pun-laden menu. This
also showed a touching faith in the chancellor's ability to hold on to his
job, because it showed considerable forward planning.
The meal, served to 100 guests, started with Dorneywood Cocktail followed by
Chancellor's Soup and ended with Number 11 mints.
The piece de resistance was Lamb Rosemary - an allusion to the chancellor's
wife. This was accompanied by Treasury Potatoes and that previously elusive
vegetable known as 'Green Shoots'.
The general mood was convivial and supportive. Lord Boyd-Carpenter, Mr
Lamont's predecessor as the local MP, gave a speech acknowledging the
chancellor was having a very rough time, but said he was fighting back with
great courage and determination.
In an earlier remark - sure to spark waves of nostalgia in Conservative
Central Office officials - he remembered that the mid-term by-election which
sent Mr Lamont to Westminster in May 1972 had been 'vigorously fought'.
Those were the days when Conservative governments used sometimes to win
mid-term by-elections.
Mr Richard Tracey, Tory MP for neighbouring Surbiton and a guest on the top
table, said he had always worked very closely with Mr Lamont.
He acknowledged local businesses had suffered during the recession but said
the feeling now was that things were taking a turn for the better.
Mr James Copeman, a constituency vice-chairman, said he thought Mr Lamont
had done well in what 'must be the most difficult job in the country' while
expressing doubt that he would still be chancellor at the end of the year.
'We have seen more of him in the last 18 months as a constituency MP than we
did previously,' he added.
Towards the end of the festivities, Mr Lamont was presented with three
gifts: a Waterford crystal clock, a painting of Kingston marketplace and an
elaborately iced cake.
It was, said Mr Jeffrey Reardon, a consultant rheumatologist and chairman of
the constituency association, a way of saying thank you for 21 years.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Motoring costs 'outstrip inflation'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE cost of motoring in Britain is rising faster than the rate of inflation,
the Automobile Association claimed yesterday.
The average motorist driving 10,000 miles a year will pay between Pounds 130
and Pounds 375 more in 1993 than last year depending on the size of car.
Increases in insurance premiums, road tax and fuel duty are the main factors
in raising motoring costs along with increases in new car list prices.
According to the AA the average cost of running a 1.4 to 2 litre car is
about Pounds 4,559 a year or 45.6p a mile based on 10,000 miles of driving.
This includes total standing charges of Pounds 2,909 - car licence (Pounds
125), insurance (Pounds 968), depreciation (Pounds 1,752), road organisation
membership (Pounds 64) - or 29.1p per mile.
On average, motoring costs for a car with a 1.4 to 2 litre petrol engine are
expected to rise by 5.5 per cent this year.
The Department of Transport yesterday published data on accident rates for
different makes and models of cars. Its information, based on 70,000
accident statistics from 1989-1991, lists 90 models.
It says newer private cars have lower casualty rates than older cars and
that the driver of a small car is about 50 per cent more likely to be
injured when involved in an accident than the driver of a large car.
The Consumers Association said it was concerned that the information on car
safety in a department leaflet was difficult for consumers to use and
potentially misleading.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Hill Samuel denies Everton sale reports
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The merchant banker Hill Samuel yesterday denied reports that it had been
instructed to arranged the sale of Everton football club.
The reports, carried in the Liverpool Echo, claimed that the Moores family,
which owns the Littlewoods pools and betting chain, had instructed Hill
Samuel to arrange a Pounds 2.5m sale of its 50 per cent stake in the club.
However, Hill Samuel spokesman yesterday said; 'Everton football club is a
banking customer, but Hill Samuel wishes to make it clear that it has not
been instructed to advise on raising financing for the club or on the
seeking of buyers.'
The Moores family yesterday also denied the report, while a spokesman for
the club dismissed it as 'sheer speculation.'
Nevertheless, with Everton reported to be some Pounds 4m in debt after a
series of financially troubled years, the rumours have added to concern
about the club's future.
Founded a century ago, the club last won the championship in 1987. Since
then it has had a mediocre run.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Petrol retailers attack suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S biggest oil companies were attacked yesterday by petrol station
owners in a survey by the Petroleum Retailers' Association, Deborah
Hargreaves writes.
Retailers were highly critical of their dealings with oil companies at a
time of big upheavals in the petrol market.
Retailers face intense competition and tougher environmental regulations.
More than half said oil company prices had not helped their profitability in
the past year. More than 45 per cent expected to see profits fall this year.
More than 40 per cent of the retailers said that the marketing advice they
received from oil companies was unhelpful.
Large operators - such as Shell, Esso and British Petroleum - fared worst in
the survey.
Mr Bruce Petter, director of the association, said the petrol industry was
'suffering a crisis of confidence'. It was of 'great concern' that oil
companies' advice on staff and marketing was poorly regarded, he added.
The association estimates that the number of petrol stations in the UK, at
present 19,000, will fall to between 12,000 and 14,000 over the next two to
three years.
Competition from hypermarkets and the rising cost of environmental
regulations would force out independent retailers, the association
predicted.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Teacher vacancies reach record low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VACANCIES for teachers at schools in England reached an all-time low in
January, Mr John Patten, the education secretary, announced yesterday.
Full-time vacancies fell by 30 per cent overall compared with 1992, with 785
openings at 19,500 nursery and primary schools, and 558 in 3,850 secondary
schools.
Vacancies for teachers of modern languages and mathematics fell by 40 per
cent. Mr Patten, who released the information in a parliamentary answer,
described the figures as 'good news for schools'. He said they meant there
was little more than one vacancy for every 20 schools.
Mr Patten also pointed out that teacher numbers in grant-maintained
(opt-out) and council-controlled schools had risen from 394,900 in January
1992 to 395,600 in January 1993.
However, provisional figures suggested that pupil-teacher ratios had risen
slightly, from 17.44 pupils per teacher to 17.66. The comparable figure for
1979 was 18.94.
This leaves the state sector with fewer resources than independent schools,
which reported last month that their pupil-teacher ratio had dropped from
10.9 pupils per teacher to 10.7. If the effect of small A-level classes is
accounted for by doubling the number of sixth-formers the figure for
independent schools still improved from 12.6 to 12.4.
In state schools, the vacancy rate is highest in inner London, at 1.5 per
cent of teachers in post, while in outer London it is 0.5 per cent. For
England excluding greater London, the vacancy rate is 0.3 per cent.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Reprieve for Swan Hunter hangs in balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SLIM hope that Swan Hunter might continue in business as a shipbuilder
hung in the balance last night as all-day talks over the fate of the three
Type 23 frigates it was fitting out when it went into receivership on
Thursday ended inconclusively.
After eight hours of negotiations with the Ministry of Defence in London, Mr
Mark Homan, senior Price Waterhouse UK Corporate Recovery partner, said: 'It
will be apparent from the fact that the receivers have been at the Ministry
of Defence all day that the matter is extremely complex.' Mr Homan hoped a
further statement could be made over the weekend.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, is to meet Mr Steve Byers, Labour MP for
Wallsend, and Mr Nick Brown, Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne East, next
week about the plight of Swans. Labour yesterday published a list of
suppliers which depend on the ship-builder for business.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said that 341 companies
in 184 Conservative constituencies were suppliers to Swan Hunter, the
Tyneside shipyard which went into receivership after failing to win a vital
helicopter carrier contract.
The range of companies supplying Swan Hunter extended even to Huntingdon -
Mr Major's constituency.
Altogether, some 900 companies are thought likely to suffer lost business if
the Swan Hunter yard closes down.
The receivers were last night holding talks with the Department of
Employment. Hope that Swan Hunter can continue as a shipbuilder hangs on
whether the frigates, worth about Pounds 400m, can be kept on the Tyne for
fitting out. They are due to be handed over to the Royal Navy between the
end of this year and late 1994, when Swan's current order books runs out.
Continuing fitting-out on the frigates would allow Swans to retain several
hundred of its current 2,200 workforce into next year, enhancing its chances
of winning further contracts and making the company more attractive to any
potential buyer. The company yesterday sent off a clarified tender for an
attack craft for the Oman government.
Yesterday, as speculation continued on how the rival tenders came to be
Pounds 50m apart, the MoD insisted the carrier bidding process had been
fairly handled, despite claims that Swan had to increase its final bid
substantially to accommodate additional features required by the ministry.
Mr Robin Ashby, public relations consultant to Swan Hunter until Thursday's
receivership, said the tenders for the carrier from Swan and VSEL last year
were both within Pounds 5m of a target price of Pounds 170m. But, after the
government confirmed in March it was to place the order and asked the rivals
to 'clarify' their bids, the MoD, Mr Ashby said, asked Swan for additional
features. These contributed to its tender rising to Pounds 210m. VSEL's
final bid, he said, was around Pounds 160m.
The MoD confirmed it had offered advice to both bidders as they prepared

both tenderers had the same specification. 'We run totally fair
competition,' it said.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Prison Service meets Group 4
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DEREK Lewis, the director-general of the Prison Service, yesterday met
directors of Group 4, the security company, to review its handling of the
first privately managed prisoner-escort contract, Alan Pike writes.
The Prison Service said that considerable progress has been made since
initial problems when Group 4 began escorting prisoners last month.
During the first fortnight of Group 4 escorting prisoners between prisons
and courts in the East Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside, several escaped
or were wrongly released. There have been no escapes during the past three
weeks.
The meeting discussed the implications of Group 4 being asked by the Prison
Service to carry out additional work not covered by the original Pounds 9.5m
per year contract.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Smith sets block vote deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, insisted yesterday that this autumn's
party conference must agree to introduce 'one-member, one-vote' for the
selection of parliamentary candidates and for electing party leaders.
Speaking to the Fire Brigades Union conference in Bridlington, he said the
party had to recognise the need to modernise its democratic processes. His
backing for the voting system may upset some union leaders who oppose it
because they believe it will weaken the traditional links between the party
and the unions.
The difficulty of Mr Smith's task in winning agreement for the change was
underlined yesterday when Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary,
argued instead for the introduction of a register of trade unionists who are
Labour supporters - an option Mr Smith does not favour. They would
participate in the selection of Labour parliamentary candidates and election
of the party leader and deputy leader.
Mr Smith's stand comes in the face of growing opposition among some of the
largest unions. So far, only the AEEU engineering union has backed the
proposals.
The unions will have 70 per cent of the vote at party conference this year
and Mr Smith will need to secure 21 per cent from them as well as all of the
constituency parties for the 51 per cent vote needed to make the change.
Leaders of six of the biggest unions are due to meet again next week to try
to reach agreement on an alternative to one-member, one-vote that might win
wider support at the party conference.
Mr Smith will address the MSF technical union's conference on Monday when he
intends to underline his determination to see the changes through. He will
also speak at the TGWU general union's conference in the summer, before the
July meeting of Labour's ruling national executive committee which is
expected to decide what changes are recommended to the conference.
As well as re-stating his commitment to modernising the party's links with
the unions, Mr Smith also used yesterday's speech to launch a renewed attack
on Mr John Major and his style of government and to call for a new sense of
direction.
Against a background of a threat of industrial action from the fire service
over pay, he also attacked the government's imposition of a 1.5 per cent
ceiling on public-sector wages, saying it was 'disgraceful' that
public-sector workers should pay the price of the government's mistakes.

FT  15 MAY 93 / BBC to review subscription service's future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of BBC Select, the corporation's specialist commercial
subscription service, is to be reviewed at next week's meeting of the BBC
board of management.
The review is on the agenda for Thursday's meeting, the first time BBC
Select has been looked at in detail since Mr John Birt took over as BBC
director-general at the beginning of the year.
BBC Select, part of the BBC's education directorate, broadcasts specialist
services for business people, accountants and lawyers in the middle of the
night to specially adapted video recorders. It has developed more slowly
than originally expected. It cost between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m to set
up and has running costs of Pounds 1m to Pounds 2m a year.
Accountancy Television, the service for accountants launched in October, has
fallen behind projections, and investors holding 40 per cent of shares have
written them off on their books. The service for lawyers, Legal Network
Television, says it is ahead of target.
Apart from subscription services, which are scrambled so that only those who
pay can see them, there are also openly broadcast services, such as those
run by BMH Communications. BMH broadcasts events such as annual meetings.
The review of BBC Select is taking place against a background of
cost-cutting throughout the BBC, where all the commercial activities are
being looked at carefully.
Some BBC Select staff fear that closure could be an option, although senior
executives think this unlikely.
Another possibility is that BBC Select will provide more training and
education programmes, and that plans for leisure subscription services, such
as one on yachting, will be delayed further.
Mr John Radcliffe, managing director of BBC Select, said yesterday: 'We are
well into negotiations for at least four new services - for the computer
industry, small businesses, French language training and arts performance.'
Some of the new services could be launched early next year.
BBC Select was set up to make use of the corporation's night hours. During
Baroness Thatcher's premiership, there were fears the night hours might be
given to the commercial sector.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Timex rejects AEEU plea for negotiation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIMEX, the US-based multi-national company, yesterday rejected a call for
peace talks from Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU engineering union, to
end the three-month strike at its Dundee circuit-board production plant.
On a visit to the picket line outside the plant yesterday, Mr Jordan urged
the company to enter into negotiations over the re-employment of 343 workers
dismissed on February 17.
But Timex said in a statement that his call for direct talks could 'not be
taken seriously while his union continues to support mass picketing and mob
intimidation outside the plant'.
Monday promises to be a crucial day in the strike. It marks the end of the
statutory 90 days required by law before an employer can re-hire selectively
from the workers it has dismissed without facing heavy financial penalties
in the courts for unfair dismissal.
The company declined to say whether it would re-employ any or all of the
strikers yesterday. It did reveal, however, that it had hired 270
replacement workers over the past three months and that it intended to
employ a further 230 over the next four months in view of an upturn in
demand for circuit boards.
Timex condemned a mass demonstration planned by strikers and their
supporters for Monday. He said it would give 'rent-a-mob another opportunity
to cause trouble at our factory gates'.
More than 2,000 supporters of the Timex strikers are expected to turn out on
Monday. The National Union of Mineworkers president, Mr Arthur Scargill, is
to address them.
Yesterday, Mr Jordan criticised Mr Scargill's intervention in the Timex
strike. 'Our union is dealing with a difficult situation and we don't want
sideshows,' he said. 'This is not a theatre, these people are in trouble.'
The AEEU will be dismayed at the continuing hard line of the company.
Throughout the dispute, the union has avoid-ed taking any action that is
unlawful and it has gone out of its way to repudiate violence and
intimidation.
Today, the Scottish TUC is organising a large rally in support of the Timex
strikers in Dundee.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Lecturers' union scorns threat to national talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL PAY negotiations for lecturers in further education colleges were
called into question yesterday.
The National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education
(Natfhe) is balloting its members on a possible one-day strike in protest
against proposed new contracts which could involve longer working hours and
shorter holidays.
The ballot will be completed on Monday, and a strike could follow on May 20.
But Mr Roger Ward, chief negotiator for the College Employers' Forum, which
was set up to negotiate on behalf of college principals, said yesterday: 'I
want to emphasise that we are not refusing to negotiate. A growing public
debate is taking place about the future of national bargaining, but we
cannot formally do anything about that until after May 20.'
Natfhe has been offered a national negotiating agreement but has not yet
signed it. A strike might persuade employers to attempt negotiations on a
local basis.
Mr Geoff Woolf, Natfhe general secretary, described that suggestion as an
'empty threat'. He said: 'It's in both sides' interests to have national
negotiations. The vast majority of principals want some things dealt with at
a national level.'
He said that Natfhe's national executive committee would endorse the
national agreement on Friday.
The dispute arises from the attempted introduction of new contracts
following the transfer of the colleges from local education authorities to
become bodies directly funded by the government.
The employers' forum wants to replace the 'Silver Book' agreement which has
governed contracts for lecturers in the sector for the past two decades. Mr
Woolf said any Natfhe action would be 'a strike against their intention to
worsen our conditions'.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Accountants get lowest rise for over 25 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANCY salaries rose by less than 3 per cent over the past year in the
lowest average increase for more than 25 years, the annual survey from
Robert Half, recruitment consultants, said yesterday.
Across the country, 15 per cent of employers said they planned to recruit
new staff this year, up from 14 per cent last year. But 18 per cent said
they planned redundancies.
Mr Jeff Grout, managing director of Robert Half, said: 'It remains a very
difficult market for candidates. 1993 is the worst job market ever for
accountants.'
It was only in the Greater London and south coast regions that most
employers said they would be recruiting new accountants.
Salaries rose on average across the country by just 2.94 per cent over the
past year compared with 4.03 per cent the preceding year and a peak of 12.9
per cent in 1988, according to an analysis of figures provided by a sample
of 420 organisations.
Newly qualified chartered accountants in London received up to Pounds 28,000
in industry and commerce and up to Pounds 26,000 in professional practice.
A financial director of a medium-sized company in London earned up to Pounds
75,000. The largest salary increases had been among staff in the financial
services sector.
Fifteen per cent of companies had a pay freeze this year and 5 per cent had
experienced a pay freeze for the past two years.
A growing number of companies - 43 per cent - were using profit-related pay,
which accounted for a large proportion of the salary increases.
Mr Grout said an increasing number were offering longer holidays to 'sugar
the pill' of no increases, with 39 per cent offering five weeks holiday this
year against 30 per cent last year.
He said employers were wrong to believe that because unemployment was high
it was easy to find suitable staff. Many ideal candidates were not moving
jobs, although this was likely to change in the next six months.
'The Monty Python image of accountants with very poor communication skills
continues,' he said. 'Employers also complain about candidates' lack of
commercial acumen.'
He said among employers seeking temporary staff there was clear evidence of
a preference for Australians and New Zealanders, who made up three quarters
of the London temporary market. He added that there was a trend towards
wider use of temporary staff.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Consumer spending boom still remote, says Mintel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSUMER boom is still a long way off in spite of signs of increased
consumer borrowing, Mintel, the market analyst, says today.
Consumers who found credit acceptable in the 1980s now regard it as debt,
and their cautious attitude should dampen hopes of a rise in consumer
confidence for a long time to come, Mintel argues.
It finds that the recession has changed perceptions of credit for anything
other than a mortgage. 'Mortgages are seen as a necessary source of debt and
quite separate from other forms of borrow-ing, a sort of unavoidable evil,'
according to the report.
Nevertheless, it finds that many young people who have not yet taken out a
mortgage are willing to live with their parents rather than commit
themselves to the financial burden.
Many potential new buyers are particularly put off by friends who have been
caught in the negative equity trap, where the value of their mortgage
exceeds the price of their home, while others are waiting for house prices
to fall further.
'While home ownership remains the long-term aim, many young people are
apparently willing to stay out of the market in the short term,' Mintel
says.
Mintel suggests that the effect will be an easing of house prices during
1993 or, at best, price stabilisation.
Consumers have become wary about borrowing to buy consumer durables.
Interest-free credit, however, is becoming increasingly popular, as
consumers view it more as an advantageous sales-and-marketing tool than as
credit, according to the re-port.
Mintel also notes that the use of debit cards is rising rapidly, as
attitudes towards credit cards have changed.
Borrowing has shown a significant decline since 1990. Mintel estimates that
there are still 1.8m households in debt in the UK, owing a total of Pounds
2bn to 3.3m creditors. It finds that consumers are trying to reduce their
debt against a background of fears of rising unemployment.
Figures released by the Central Statistical Office this month showed that
consumer borrowing had increased unexpectedly to a seasonally adjusted
Pounds 232m in March - the highest since April 1991 - from Pounds 54m in
February. Mintel, however, expects the prevailing caution to persist for
several years and for consumer spending to remain sluggish for the next two
years.

FT  15 MAY 93 / UK lending figures down in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE subdued state of lending by British banks to UK residents was
highlighted yesterday by Bank of England figures showing that total lending
rose just Pounds 2.2bn to Pounds 395.8bn in the four months to the end of
March, Peter Norman writes.
The Bank said lending to individuals rose Pounds 2.3bn. Borrowing by
financial institutions - mainly securities dealers and building societies -
rose Pounds 2.5bn while lending to industry and commerce fell Pounds 3.6bn.
The increase in borrowing by individuals was more than accounted for by
Pounds 2.6bn-worth of lending for house-buying.
Bridging loans and other advances to individuals declined during the four
months.
A Pounds 1.2bn drop in borrowing by manufacturers accounted for a third of
the fall in lending to industry and commerce. Lending to property companies
fell Pounds 1bn in the four months bringing the drop in their borrowings to
Pounds 3.1bn since the end of 1991. Lending to construction companies fell
Pounds 500m, the eighth such drop in succession, to produce a total fall of
Pounds 3.3bn or 21 per cent in lending to this sector since February 1991.
The Bank's figures are neither seasonally adjusted nor comparable with
earlier quarterly data. They cover a four-month period to bring future
statistics into line with the calendar quarter.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
NATIONAL Savings contributed Pounds 249m to government funding in April,
although most of this - Pounds 162m - came from accrued interest. Net sales
were just Pounds 87m, with gross sales of Pounds 660m being offset by
repayments of Pounds 573m, Philip Coggan writes.
In the 1992-93 financial year, National Savings contributed Pounds 4.36bn
and provoked complaints from some building societies about unfair
competition. The First Option Bond, which was particularly singled out, was
relaunched at a lower rate and raised just Pounds 48m in April. Last year it
raised Pounds 880m in four months.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Ex-detectives join private investigators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO FORMER senior officers of the Metropolitan Police have been recruited by
Kroll Associates, the US private investigation agency. The move became known
yesterday as Mr Jules Kroll, head of the agency, called for bank secrecy
laws to be eased in cases of suspected criminal activity.
Former Detective Superintendent Tony McStravick, who was until recently the
commander of the Met's Fraud Squad attached to the Serious Fraud Office, has
been appointed a consultant to Kroll. Mr John O'Connor, former commander of
the Met's Flying Squad and Regional Crime Squad, becomes Kroll's director of
investigations.
Mr Kroll said the agency expected the officers to contribute 'knowledge of
City institutions and of the investigation and prosecution of fraud'.
Mr Kroll told the Financial Times yesterday that the International Monetary
Fund should put pressure on member countries to ease bank secrecy. 'Today
there are many more places in the world where banking secrecy is a powerful
obstacle to discovery,' he said. 'It has become more of a problem to chase
the money than to chase the people.'
Mr Kroll said there were about 16 banking jurisdictions including Austria,
Liechtenstein, the Cayman Islands, the Dutch Antilles and Paraguay where
investigators were encountering lack of co-operation.
He named Switzerland as an example of a country that in recent years had
become more co-operative in proving banking information.
'By contrast Austria is terribly difficult. It is one of the most vigorous
countries in enforcing bank secrecy laws and has used this as a tactical
advantage with which to take business away from Swiss banks,' Mr Kroll said.
Mr Kroll, sometimes known as Wall Street's 'private eye', employs 250 people
in 11 offices worldwide. After the Gulf War he was hired by the Kuwait
government to trace Iraqi assets around the world.
Mr McStravick has been involved in a series of major financial
investigations in recent years including the House of Fraser takeover by the
Fayeds, Homes Assured Corporation, Dunsdale Securities and Brent Walker.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Company insolvencies continue to fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANY INSOLVENCIES in England and Wales fell in the first three months of
this year for the second quarter in succession, figures from British
Chambers of Commerce showed yesterday.
Seasonally adjusted company compulsory liquidations and creditors' voluntary
liquidations were 5,705 for the first quarter of 1993 compared with 6,029 in
the last quarter of last year and 5,796 in the first quarter of last year.
But the proportion of company insolvencies to total businesses has not
declined and remains at its highest recorded level.
It stood at 2.6 per cent of active trading companies and 2.2 per cent of all
companies for the first quarter of 1993, the third successive quarter at
those levels.
'The specious reaction is that this is a great relief and will relieve the
pressure of bad debts on other businesses,' said Ms Fiona Johnson from the
British chambers. 'We were surprised that the failure rate is not higher.'
'But if you look a little deeper, the proportion of active trading
businesses remains high,' she said. 'The figure is still unacceptably high.'
The chambers said the figures nonetheless provided some evidence that the
economic tide is turning, and provide support for business and employee and
consumer confidence.
Total company insolvencies were 24,334 for the 12 months to the end of March
1993. The figures come from records at Companies House and the Department of
Trade and Industry's Insolvency Ser-vice.
Seasonally adjusted individual insolvencies continued to rise. They were
10,233 for the first quarter of the year compared with 9,795 in the final
quarter of 1992 and 8,773 in the first quarter of last year.
The absolute decline in company failures corresponds with figures in the
last few months on receivership and administration appointments compiled by
accountants Touche Ross from the official London and Edinburgh Gazettes.
Traditionally it takes 18 months from the beginning of economic recovery
before corporate failures decline as companies seek new working capital from
their bankers. The decline in the figures may indicate a more res-ponsive
attitude from the banks.
The figures also echo figures released last week from the Lord Chancellor's
Office for winding-up petitions. They showed 4,608 petitions for the first
quarter of this year, down 3.5 per cent on the first quarter last year.

FT  15 MAY 93 / China may soften on HK poll: Report says broader electoral
base is being considered
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE prospect of a resolution of the Anglo-Chinese rift over Hong Kong's
political development appeared to improve yesterday with a report of a more
conciliatory Chinese attitude to the conduct of the colony's 1995 elections.
The report, by Reuter's news agency, of a softer line from Beijing came amid
conflicting signals from China. On Wednesday, for example, an official
Chinese commentary on Mr Chris Patten's recent visit to the US described the
governor as a 'whore'.
Reuter, quoting Chinese sources in Hong Kong, said Beijing was ready to
consider broadening the electoral base for the 30 'functional' members of
the colony's Legislative Council proposed by Mr Patten in the autumn. The
news agency's sources also said China wanted an electoral college more
broadly composed than the one Mr Patten suggested.
Mr Patten's proposals for Hong Kong's political development included
increasing the number of voters who would be eligible to elect the
'functional' members of the 60-member council, and a requirement that an
electoral college, which will appoint 10 members to LegCo, itself be
elected.
The governor and his officials have indicated in the past that the precise
shape of the electoral college was secondary to the requirement that members
be elected.
Meanwhile, Mr Patten seemed to play down the importance of his blueprint for
the colony's political development to bilateral talks which began three
weeks ago and which resume next week in the Chinese capital. At a press
conference yesterday with Lady Thatcher, former UK premier, he described his
proposals as 'part of our thinking as we take part in these talks'.
Since last October he has consistently described his proposals as
representing his best judgment of the 'balance' in Hong Kong between the
desire for more democracy and harmonious relations with China.

a series of bloody hold-ups, and the kidnapping of a former Belgian prime
minister, committed suicide in his cell, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels.
The death of Patrick Haemers, Belgium's most notorious prisoner, will
further upset preparations for the trial of the so-called 'Haemers gang'
which has already been delayed once for lack of a jury and undermined by the
escape of two of the eight people accused alongside Haemers.
He faced a four-month wait for trial, while the Belgian parliament rushed

FT  15 MAY 93 / Beijing raises interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA yesterday raised interest rates on bank lending in an attempt to cool
an overheated economy and avoid a resurgence of inflation that is
threatening reform.
Interest rates on treasury bills were also increased sharply following the
failure of the March offering, which was heavily undersubscribed, prompting
the authorities to ban new issues of debt and equities securities.
The Finance Ministry announced that interest on bank loans would be raised
from 8.64 per cent to 9.36 per cent, and rates on deposits would also
increase in an effort to stop the flow of funds from the banking system.
The interest rate increase had been widely expected in the light of China's
continuing high rates of growth and a big jump in urban inflation in the
first quarter. The cost of living increase in China's larger cities reached
15.7 per cent in the three months to March.
Western economists were sceptical, however, about the likely effectiveness
of the fairly modest increase in the lending rate to slow China's economic
juggernaut. China registered growth last year of 12.8 per cent, and an
annualised 14.1 per cent in the first four months of this year compared with
the same period in 1992.
Among constraints on a larger increase in lending rates is the precarious
health of many state enterprises that are heavily in debt and barely
surviving. Government officials described steps taken yesterday as an
attempt to 'fine tune' the economy.
China last adjusted interest rates in April 1991, when it reduced them in an
effort to stimulate the economy. The authorities also abandoned at the same
time the system that made it compulsory for workers to buy treasury bonds.
Rates on three- and five-year treasury bills have been raised to 12.52 per
cent and 14.06 per cent from 10 and 11 per cent respectively. It was not
clear whether the new rates would apply to unsold March bills.
But the People's Bank reiterated yesterday that enterprise bonds should not
offer rates higher than government paper. China's central bank also repeated
its instruction that no enterprise bonds were to be sold before the backlog
of treasury bills was cleared.
By the scheduled April 30 expiry date for the March treasury bond issue only
about 15 per cent of the Yuan 30bn (Pounds 3.3bn) offering had been taken
up.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Yeltsin hails 'breakthrough' in CIS meeting

   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BORIS Yeltsin, the Russian president, claimed a 'breakthrough' in the
development of the Commonwealth of Independent States after meeting his
fellow heads of state in Moscow yesterday, John Lloyd reports.
Mr Yeltsin claimed that all but one of the members of the CIS - the gas-rich
Central Asian state of Turkmenistan - had agreed to the creation of an
economic union.
However, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president who has continued to
take a sceptical view of the CIS, said after the meeting: 'We have only
signed a declaration. We have not created an economic union yet'.
Mr Yeltsin said that an Inter-Republican Bank would be set up from October
1, while a customs and currency union would be set up to work in parallel
with it.
The RIA news agency said last night that it was expected that a consultative
and co-ordinating commission, together with an executive secretariat, would
also be created to service the new economic union.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A KEY Russian conservative leader yesterday admitted that most regional
leaders supported President Boris Yeltsin's constitutional reforms.
Mr Nikolay Ryabov, deputy to parliamentary chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov, said
that if deputies rejected Mr Yeltsin's plan for a constitutional assembly,
they would push society to confrontation.
His change of tack has given the president a substantial boost in his
efforts to introduce a constitution designed to bolster his powers.
'The situation in the country has changed. All the heads of the
administration and half of the leaders of the local councils will go to the
Kremlin (that is, take part in a proposed constitutional assembly). If we
step aside from participation this assembly will turn into a constituent
assembly and adopt a constitution. We must put this under our control at
least in part.'
The president got support from an even more surprising quarter - Mr Sergei
Baburin, a leader of the hard-line nationalists Russian Unity bloc - though
he said that the final decision on the constitution should be taken by the
Congress of Peoples Deputies, the full assembly of the present parliament.
In bowing to the increasingly obvious fact of Mr Yeltsin's greater influence
and power over the regional leaders, the parliamentary leaders have reserved
their right - set out under the present constitution - to act as the final
body which can confirm the constitution. This means that Mr Yeltsin has at
least convinced some of his opponents that they must fight on ground of his
choosing.
This tactical shift by two strong opponents of Mr Yeltsin came at the same
time as the parliament voted to ask the Constitutional Court to rule on the
legality of Mr Yeltsin's attempt to bypass the parliament by calling the
constitutional convention composed of representatives of the republics.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Indian students cry foul in the exam hall

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOME students will go to almost any lengths to secure a university degree in
modern India, such is their importance. Stealing examination papers, bribing
invigilators and copying are endemic in many of the country's 206
universities.
However, Indians have this week been shocked to discover that even Delhi
University, one of the country's most prestigious, is not immune to
allegations of foul play in the examination hall.
Last Saturday, the university authorities were forced to cancel a commercial
studies paper after a former student produced a copy before the examination
started, claiming he had bought it for Rs10,000 (Pounds 206). On Tuesday, a
second commercial studies paper suffered the same fate after a journalist
bought a leaked copy for Rs5,000.
The leaks followed a host of complaints about misprints in Delhi University
exam papers, the poor translation of questions from English into Hindi and
the delivery of wrong papers to examination halls.
The protests culminated in a sit-in on Thursday by scores of lecturers
outside the offices of the vice-chancellor, Professor Upendra Baxi,
demanding action to restore the university's damaged reputation. 'What we
have earned in 71 years, we now stand to lose because of this failure in the
examination system,' says Mr S S Rathi, a physicist and one of the
organisers of the demonstration.
Professor Baxi has responded by condemning the leaks of papers as an attempt
to 'sabotage' the university examination system and calling in the police to
investigate the alleged leaks.
The number of students enrolled at Indian universities has risen by 75 per
cent since 1980 to 4.5m. Delhi University alone has 180,000 students,
including thousands doing correspondence courses who sit their examinations
in centres throughout the country.
The credibility of some smaller institutions has already been destroyed by
the weight of student numbers. Mr Rathi says that some universities have
been forced to postpone examinations for a year or more because of student
unrest and other problems. Now he fears for the future of Delhi University.
'The sanctity of the examination is under threat,' he says.
That is a frightening thought for thousands of Indian students and for their
prospective employers who have long regarded unversity examination results
as the main measure of the worth of potential recruits.

FT  15 MAY 93 / US industrial output makes weak rebound
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US INDUSTRIAL production edged up last month after a pause in March,
indicating the economy is moving ahead slowly, the Federal Reserve said
yesterday.
Output rose 0.1 per cent, a weaker than expected rebound from March, when
production was hit by severe winter storms on the east coast. The annual
increase was a more robust 3.4 per cent.
Many forecasters expect a stronger rebound later this quarter following
signs that consumer spending is recovering after a weak first quarter.
Reports this week showed a 1.2 per cent rise in retail sales between March
and April; vehicles sales in early May remained well above first quarter
levels.
Consumer confidence, however, remains fragile: the University of Michigan's
index was yesterday reported at 81.9 in early May against 85.6 per cent last
month, reflecting growing public doubts about the efficacy of the Clinton
economic plan. Separate figures yesterday confirmed a big increase in
corporate inventories in March, which could depress growth in the second
quarter.
The modest overall rise in industrial output last month masked significant
differences in sectoral performance. Manufacturing production was up 0.4 per
cent and by 4.2 per cent in the past year. However, output of utilities
fell.
Production is biased toward business equipment, which rose 0.8 per cent in
April for the second month running. Led by a surge in computer production,
business equipment output has risen more than 11 per cent in the past year.
Production of consumer goods, however, fell 0.2 per cent last month and was
up only 2.4 per cent relative to April last year.
Revisions to data since 1987 led to an increase in the Fed's estimate of the
rate of industrial capacity utilisation - to 81.4 per cent last month, which
could help explain why inflationary pressures have been stronger than
expected.

Mr Nobili is alleged to have helped arrange a L600m payment to the

In another development in Italy's corruption scandal, the fast moving
enquiry into kick-backs paid on telecommunications contracts led Milan
magistrates to warn Mr Carlo Vizzini, a former minister for posts, he was
under investigation for alleged illicit funding of a political party.

MR Justice V. Ramaswamy of the Indian Supreme Court, who survived a
politically charged attempt to impeach him on corruption charges, announced
yesterday he would resign, Reuter reports from New Delhi.
'The defeat of the impeachment motion against me in the Lok Sabha (lower
house of parliament) has vindicated my stand,' Mr Ramaswamy said. It had
also 'safeguarded for the future fearless and independent judges from
scurrilous attacks and calumny from motivated persons'.
Charges had been brought against him by a fellow Sup-reme Court judge, a
state chief justice and an eminent jurist.

THE Palestinians are unlikely to attend a further round of Middle East peace
talks without Israel first lifting its closure of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip and accelerating the return of Palestinian deportees in south Lebanon,
a Palestine Liberation Organisation spokesman said yesterday.
Mr Jamil Hilal, director of PLO information, said 'very obvious, practical
steps' would be required from Israel before the Palestinian delegation could
return for a tenth round of talks in Washington.
The ninth round finished on Thursday with no signs of progress and no date
set for a resumption. Optimism at the start of the three weeks of talks
foundered when the Palestinians rejected first an Israeli, then a US-drafted
document aimed at bridging differences on a statement of principles to guide
negotiations.
Mr Hilal said the PLO leadership in Tunis had been angered by the US
proposal, the first direct American intervention in the talks since their
inception, which he called 'identical to the Israeli position'. The Israeli
delegates were yesterday still examining the document, which sets out a
formula to govern talks towards Palestinian autonomy in the occupied
territories.
Mr Hilal also said the Palestinians were disappointed by the US, Egypt and
the Gulf states for a failure to deliver on promises made before the latest
round of talks and which had finally persuaded the Palestinians to attend.
Chief among these was an apparent undertaking to return more of the 400
Palestinian deportees in south Lebanon and, from some Gulf states, to
provide at least Dollars 70m (Pounds 45m) in immediate aid for Palestinian
institutions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Mr Hilal said: 'These steps
and others will have to be taken, as a minimum, before the Palestinians will
return to the table.'
The next focus of Arab diplomacy bearing on the talks will be a foreign
ministers' meeting of all the Arab parties, probably in Amman early next
month. The Palestinians will seek a common declaration from the Syrian,
Jordanian and Lebanese ministers for a set of conditions which must be met
before talks can resume.

A CEASEFIRE between Georgian and Abkhazian forces in the breakaway republic
of Abkhazia was agreed yesterday in Moscow by Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the
leader of the Georgian parliament and Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian
president.
The two leaders agreed to ensure a cessation of hostilities next Thursday,
and to order the withdrawal of all heavy weapons and aircraft from the
conflict zone. The two leaders will then reconvene the conference between
themselves and the Abkhazian leaders which met last September to end the
conflict.
Georgian troops have been fighting rebels in the Abkhazian autonomous
republic to the north of Georgia for almost a year, with much of the
conflict concentrated round the regional capital of Sukhumi, where sporadic
fighting has recently intensified. Russian troops continue to man bases in
Abkhazia, and have been accused by the Georgians of helping the
secessionists.
Mr Shevardnadze said after the meeting that if the agreements on Abkhazia
stood, a general agreement between Russia and Georgia should be signed by
mid-June.
The stalemated conflict, along with Armenia's undeclared war with
Azerbaijan, has made the Caucasus mountains second only to Yugoslavia as
Europe's most hostile region. Abkhazia is seeking independence, but Georgia
refuses to alter its status as an autonomous republic within Georgia.
The Abkhazia war has killed an estimated 3,000 people on both sides, and
helped to cripple the economies of Georgia and, to the south, Armenia.
The war has also ignited a mercenary movement in the troubled south Russia
portion of the Caucasus, a stretch of tiny autonomous republics that form an
umbrella over Georgia. Hundreds of Moslem fighters from the Russian Caucusus
have gone to Abkhazia to oppose what they see as Georgian aggression.
In addition, Mr Shevardnadze recently suggested that Georgia and Russia
themselves risk war because of increasingly persuasive evidence that Russian
military forces are backing the Abkhaz with bombing runs over Georgian-held
areas.
Mr Shevardnadze has been careful not to antagonise his northern neighbour by
accusing Mr Yeltsin of ordering military support for the Abkhaz. He
nonetheless believes that Georgia's real war is with Russians, not the
Abkhaz rebels, and he has some support.
A western diplomat who visited the warfront said: 'There is Russian support,
there is no question about it. The Abkhaz would not be able to hold out the
way they have if it weren't for Russia.'
The war, and a lawless environment in Tbilisi and other regions that the
conflict has spawned, have dominated Mr Shevardnadze's attention since he
came to power.
The economy has been left in tatters. Most of the republic's 275 factories
are closed or operating at 10-30 per cent of capacity. The few foreign
investors in Georgia complain that, despite Mr Shevardnadze's reformism,
there can be no trade deal without assent from the leader's office.
Mr Shevardnadze sees improved relations with Russia as the key to Georgia
emerging from an economic crisis in which GDP has shrunk by more than 35 per
cent since 1989.
Russia has worsened the collapse with an economic squeeze.
Moscow has tightened credit and, after months in which cash-broke Tbilisi
was unable to pay many government employees, Russia in January backed out of
an agreement to supply Rbs60bn to the republic.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXCHANGE markets are wrong to think that the Spanish peseta and the
Portuguese escudo are irrevocably linked, and the escudo will not
necessarily follow another devaluation of the peseta, according to Mr Miguel
Beleza, governor of the Bank of Portugal, the central bank.
He was speaking to the Financial Times yesterday after Portugal followed
Spain's 8 per cent devaluation of the peseta with a 6.5 per cent devaluation
of the escudo on Thursday.
'Our economies are naturally very closely linked in trade and finance.
However those links do not imply that we need to follow Spanish
devaluations, particularly by the same amount,' he said. He said that of
Spain's last three devaluations Portugal had only followed two, and only one
by the same amount.
Mr Beleza's denial of an inevitable link between the two currencies comes in
the the context of political instability in Spain, where analysts predict a
stable government may not emerge for some months after the general election
on June 6.
The governor made it clear that Portugal would follow political developments
in Spain closely, particularly after the election. But he believed there was
no reason for the perception in the exchange markets that the escudo would
follow the peseta if it was devalued again during a period of political
instability.
'Thursday's (Portuguese) devaluation was neither desirable or necessary,' he
said. 'We believe there were no fundamental competitive economic reasons for
the escudo to devalue. However, given the circumstances, all alternatives,
including doing nothing, were worse.'
He said in the absence of the move by the Spanish authorities, Portugal
would not have acted. 'We would have preferred that none of this happened.'
He said the Portuguese economy was much healthier than Spain's in regard to
the external balance and unemployment. Portugal would also close its
inflation gap with Spain rapidly. Portugal's year-on-year inflation figure
for April is expected to be just over 6 per cent, compared to 4.6 per cent
in Spain.
Despite Spain's economic difficulties, Mr Beleza appeared generally
surprised by the Spanish devaluation and noted that Madrid had unusually
decided to act while the markets were still open.
The escudo traded at Es95.8-Es96.3 to the D-Mark in Lisbon yesterday. It was
quoted at Es97.5 after the central bank suspended support on Thursday.
Short-term interbank interest rates fell from 18 to 15 per cent.

DENMARK'S business leaders, anxious to avoid a second rejection of the
European Community's Maastricht treaty, said yesterday interest rates would
be likely to fall significantly and investment would increase if the country
votes Yes in next Tuesday's referendum.
A Gallup poll published yesterday showed the Yes camp growing slightly to 50
per cent, against 32 per cent for the Noes, with 13 per cent undecided and 5
per cent set to abstain.
But a poll in the business newspaper Boersen showed the Noes narrowing the
gap significantly. It gave the Yes vote 50 per cent, No 39 per cent, and 11
per cent undecided.
The same poll a week ago showed 53 per cent for Yes and 34 per cent for No,
with 13 per cent undecided.
At a joint press conference, leaders of the Federation of Danish Industries,
representing manufacturers, the Employers' Association and the Bankers'
Association, emphasised a central message of the Yes campaign that a second
rejection would have strongly negative economic consequences.
Mr Klaus Willerslev-Olsen, deputy head of the Bankers' Association, said
there had been a premium on Danish interest rates since the first referendum
last June. He predicted a fall of 1.5 to 2 points in interest rates if there
is a Yes this time.
The current key central bank money market interest rate is 9.75 per cent and
the official discount rate is 9.25 per cent, about two points ahead of
short-term rates in neighbouring Germany.
The Danish krona has been under sporadic pressure during the referendum
campaign amid speculation that a No vote would force Denmark to seek an
exchange rate adjustment within the framework of the ERM, or even to float
the krona.
Mr Poul Erik Pedersen, head of the Employers' Association, said many
companies had put investment plans on hold after last June's No.
Lego, the Danish toymaker, suspended a DKr300m (Pounds 31.5m) expansion
programme and has said the project will only go ahead if there is a Yes vote
next week.
Mr Pedersen said a No vote would also have an adverse effect on foreign
investment in Denmark. He said a report by the Keidanren, Japan's industrial
federation, which for the first time commended Denmark as a potential target
for Japanese investment had been withdrawn after last June's vote.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Germany warns Croatian leader: Clinton still hopes to win

GERMANY, Croatia's most loyal supporter in Europe, yesterday warned Croatian
President Franjo Tudjman that he risked losing western support if he did
nothing to prevent the Bosnian Croats from attacking Moslems in Bosnia.
The German warning came as fighting between Croats and Moslems continued in
Mostar despite a ceasefire and as Serb forces pressed an attack against
Moslems near the strategically placed town of Brcko.
In Washington, meanwhile, President Bill Clinton said he would keep pushing
his proposals to lift the UN arms embargo, so that Bosnian Moslems can get
heavier weapons, and to use air power against Serb targets. His plan had
'not been rejected out of hand'. Some European allies had agreed with it and
'others are not prepared to go that far yet'. Mr Clinton also said he had
reservations about trying to set up and protect 'safe havens' for Moslems.
The warning to Croatia was delivered by Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign
minister, when he met Mr Tudjman in Zagreb. He was speaking both for his own
country and the whole EC, which earlier this week sent a similar message to
the Croatian president.
Mr Kinkel said the United Nations would shortly publish a report containing
evidence of direct Croatian involvement in the fighting in Bosnia between
Croats and Moslems, formerly allies in the struggle against the Bosnian
Serbs.
After two hours of talks with Mr Tudjman, the German minister said other
countries considered that Zagreb exerted decisive influence over the Bosnian
Croat militias, which are reported to be armed and financed from Croatia.
Though Mr Tudjman denied Zagreb bore any responsibility for Bosnian Croats'
acts, he told Mr Kinkel he would go to Mostar in the next few days to try to
persuade them to halt their attacks on Moslems.
A UN spokesman in New York said Mr Tudjman might meet Bosnian President
Alija Izetbegovic in Mostar next Tuesday to discuss how to end the fighting.
He said they had invited the international mediators, Lord Owen and Mr
Thorvald Stoltenberg, to attend. The mediators were expected to hold talks
in Moscow at the weekend and in London on Monday before flying to Bosnia.
Although fighting between Croats and Moslems continued in Mostar yesterday,
it was waged with less intensity than in the past few days. Spanish UN
troops came under fire as they tried to approach the line of confrontation
between the warring parties.
In the struggle between Serbs and Moslems in the north of the country, Serb
forces pushed forward towards the town of Brcko, which commands an important
supply route linking Serb territories in eastern and western Bosnia.
Moslem-controlled Sarajevo radio said more than 30 Serb tanks were trying to
break through Moslem lines near the town. Some 20 people had been killed in
the Serb offensive since Thursday and villages in the area had been
destroyed, the radio said.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Germany's cool diplomat moves on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major, the UK prime minister, recently invited him to 10 Downing
Street to say a special goodbye. The Sun, Britain's raucously xenophobic
best-selling daily paper, saluted him as 'a gem' in a farewell editorial.
(It also misspelled his name.)
'He's been a great success at a very difficult time. He's a harmoniser,'
says Sir Sigmund Sternberg, a member of the Board of Deputies of British
Jews, which - highly unusually - hosted a reception to bid him auf
Wiedersehen.
The man they are talking about is Mr Hermann von Richthofen, Germany's
ambassador to the UK. After a hectic 4 1/2 -year tenure, and plenty of
practice in weathering diplomatic squalls, he leaves London today to become
his country's ambassador to Nato.
Mr von Richthofen has made an impact for two reasons. First, he has
succeeded in presenting united Germany's human face not just to officials
but also to a broad cross-section of the British public.
In incidents ranging from disputes over German reunification with Mrs
Margaret (now Baroness) Thatcher to last autumn's row over Britain's exit
from the exchange rate mechanism, Mr von Richthofen has kept his cool under
fire.
In his Belgravia residence, Mr von Richthofen calls 'rock solid' the general
state of Anglo-German relations. 'We have had some irritations and some
disturbances, but they always went away very quickly.'
During his time in London, Germany has attracted flak for being too
aggressive - and also for not being aggressive enough. In 1991, in a unique
interview with the Sun, the ambassador defended his compatriots from charges
of being 'cowards' during the Gulf war, where Germany played a conspicuously
dormant role.
Since the ambassador appreciates British humour, he says he 'saw the funny
side' of his portrayal in the newspaper under the headline 'The Hun meets
the Sun'.
His worst moments, he says, came amid the recriminations after Britain's ERM
exit last September. 'When the Bundesbank was under unjust attack, you ask
yourself what have you done that you're so badly understood.'
He bristles slightly at the memory of his brusque invitation to explain to
the Foreign Office the leaking to the press of a document giving the
Bundesbank's version of events.
In spite of this episode, Mr von Richthofen says the Germans can learn from
the British 'to be more relaxed, more natural, not too pushy'.
What can Britain learn from Germany? The UK should pay more attention to
manufacturing industry and vocational training, the ambassador says, giving
engineers 'a higher position in the elite'.
Britain would also benefit from decentralisation. 'Giving regions and
municipalities more autonomy - this could also be something you could
learn.'
West Germany was established as a federal state after the second world war
partly as a result of British policy, Mr von Richthofen points out.
He adds a finely-weighed ounce of diplomatic judgment: 'We took your advice.
But, because of your different traditions, you didn't follow it up in your
own country.'

<TEXT>
SPAIN'S troubles in the European exchange rate mechanism have prompted a
ripple of satisfaction among British industrialists. Seven months of lower
interest rates, a competitive pound and signs of economic recovery have left
the ERM with few friends among businessmen.
'I'm happy that Britain got out of the ERM when it did,' says Mr Bill
Ebbert, chairman and managing director of the Vauxhall car group. 'The
devaluation has made our plants considerably more competitive. I would not
jump back in again if it meant the pound moving up to some arbitrarily high
level.'
Many company directors - even those who originally supported ERM membership
 -believe re-entry is a long way off.
The chairman of a large retailer says: 'The problem about the ERM was that
it was always fatuous to base the country's economic policy around the
single goal of bringing down inflation. A broader perspective is required,
which could involve a set of detailed policies for a range of industrial
sectors.'
Even the Confederation of British Industry, a former ERM enthusiast, now
doubts the merits of an early re-entry. 'I think it is fair to say that
re-entry to the ERM is not our number one priority,' says Mr Sudhir
Junankar, head of CBI forecasts. 'Our view is we should not rejoin the ERM
until certain conditions are met, namely more convergence between the
economies of Europe and further German rate cuts.'
Mr Michael Atkinson, finance director of Oxley, a small electronics company,
says: 'We haven't found the floating exchange rate a particular headache. We
can take precautious by buying currencies on the forward market to cover
certain large transactions.'
But amid the enthusiasm for a flexible exchange rate, one or two voices
stand out.
Mr Ian Gibson, managing director of the UK arm of Nissan, the Japanese car
maker, says: 'Business needs a stable exchange rate, but how you achieve
this is up to the government and the central bank.'
'We are not leaping up and down with joy about being out of the ERM,' says
the finance director of a scientific instruments exporter. 'There was a
certain stability there. All we have had now is a short-term boost. Although
rates were perhaps too high, a stable environment is obviously the best one
to do business in.'
Michael Skapinker adds: Spain's share of the UK package tour market is
expected to grow as a result of the peseta devaluation - even though the
effect will not feed through to holiday brochure prices until summer 1994.

THE struggle between employers and IG Metall, Germany's powerful engineering
union, was not a struggle for the hearts, the minds, or even the economic
interests of eastern Germans. Instead, until the early hours of yesterday
morning, both sides were using eastern Germany as a means of fulfilling
their own goals.
IG Metall successfully balloted, and called a strike for two reasons. The
first was a point of principle. It wanted the employers to reinstate a
contract signed with the union in March 1991 which would have equalised
western and eastern German wage levels by next year.
Both sides agreed on the contract, but for different reasons. Western
employers - not wholly united on this - believed high wages would stifle
eastern German competitiveness. The union wanted the contract to maintain
high wage levels in the west.
In the run-up to the strike, Mr Franz Steinkuhler, IG Metall's president,
believed Gesamtmetall, the metal and electrical employers' association,
wanted to discard the contract as a first step towards ending the tradition
of collective wage bargaining, first in eastern Germany and later in western
Germany. Yesterday's agreement guards that principle, despite modifications.
IG Metall was also determined to keep up the pressure in the belief if it
did not 'win' in eastern Germany, then it could not use that victory to
maintain high wage levels in western Germany. 'We are striking for that as
well,' one union official admitted, adding: 'The strike in eastern Germany
is a solidarity strike for today's unemployed, and for those of tomorrow
because we will have won for them higher unemployment benefits'.
The employers were just as determined to prolong the strike. They too were
fighting for a principle, articulated by the Mittelstand - the small and
medium-sized enterprises in Gesamtmetall - rather than the big corporations.
The strike might never have started had the giant corporations such as
Siemens, AEG, and Volkswagen felt they had something to lose in a prolonged
dispute. 'We were not worried about the strike,' a Siemens official said.
'Our turnover in eastern Germany is less than 2 per cent of our total
turnover. We can afford the pay rises.'
But for the Mittelstand, the strike provided an opportunity to break away
from collective wage bargaining, and negotiate individual plant contracts
which they could afford. They had a point. They started investing in eastern
Germany in 1990 and 1991 when markets still existed in eastern Europe and
the former Soviet Union. But the collapse of these markets and the recession
in western Germany weakened their prospects.
They genuinely could not afford wage increases of more than 20 per cent this
year as productivity continued to lag behind western German levels by at
least 65 per cent, and labour costs were 70 per cent above western German
levels.
The Mittelstand has won a partial victory. Income parity has been postponed:
it will now be introduced by, at latest, mid-1996. Wage increases will be
lower than expected. IG Metall has managed to maintain the principle of
collective wage bargaining, albeit with more flexibility.
As for the eastern Germans, IG Metall has proved it can organise a strike in
the region. But the five new states have simply been pawns in a power game
played by the unions and the employers.

SPANIARDS, who woke up poorer Europeans yesterday after an 8 per cent
devaluation of the peseta late on Thursday, spent much of the day glued to
the radio.
They were trying to find out where the fallout would settle after 'Black
Thursday' - eight hours in which the peseta was devalued, interest rates
fell and the government reported higher unemployment and inflation. This
would be the blackest weekend for the Socialist government before the
general election on June 6.
But reaction was mixed, despite the best efforts of the opposition to focus
attention on the fact that the devaluation of the peseta on Thursday was the
third in nearly nine months and seemed to imply a failure of government
economic policy.
Mr Jordi Pujol, Catalonia chief minister and a likely power broker in any
hung parliament, only half-blamed the government. The Socialists had become
'lost in a grand delirium' by trying to hold the peseta at unsustainable
levels, he said, but the devaluation was good news for industry and
agriculture.
That dilemma affected even the harshest critics of the government in
business, which warmly welcomed the Bank of Spain's 1.5 percentage point cut
in official interest rates, down to 11.5 per cent.
Mr Carlos Espinosa de los Monteros, chief of Daimler-Benz in Spain, and a
possible finance minister should the conservative Partido Popular (PP)
unseat the Socialists, said devaluation had been inevitable. But while he
warned that 'every devaluation should be accompanied by a package of
measures' to reinforce its credibility - an impossibility until after an
election - responsibility for reducing wage costs 'is not just the
government's, it is society's as a whole'.
Mr Jose Maria Aznar, the PP leader, had no such nuances. 'We have to get
this government out of the way,' he told an election rally, 'before they do
any more damage.'
But as commercial banks announced sharp cuts in lending rates, the PP's
problem, in trying to attack the government on the devaluation, is that it
has come as a relief to the country. The Madrid stock market rose for a
second day as euphoria over the rate cuts generated heavy trading. And were
the opposition to criticise the new parity, this could only provoke further
speculation against the currency.
This is already a campaign based on the personalities of Mr Aznar and prime
minister Felipe Gonzalez, rather than on policy, and the PP must try to
persuade undecided voters that while the interest rate cuts are welcome, the
cost of not making them earlier has cut the country's foreign exchange
reserves almost in half, to less than Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13bn), and that
high interest rates have cost jobs and businesses.
Nevertheless the government, which cleverly sought the devaluation on the
same day as year-on-year inflation in April was said to have risen from 4
per cent to 4.6 per cent and which used the turmoil to announce that 253,000
people had lost their jobs in the first quarter of this year, was bracing
itself for a media battering over the weekend.
Mr Gonzalez and his lieutenants tried to counter claims that they had
reversed the hardline monetary policy, by arguing that the interest rate
cuts would mark the beginning of a recovery for the economy, which has been
in recession since late last year.

MR Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, suffered a setback yesterday
when ultra-nationalists walked out of a pan-Serbian parliamentary session
convened to persuade Bosnian Serbs to back an international peace plan.
The remaining parliamentary deputies voted to back the Vance-Owen peace plan
following the walk-out by more than 100 deputies of the Serbian Radical
party, until recently unofficial allies of Mr Milosevic.
Rebel Serbs from Bosnia and Croatia sent only observers to the extraordinary
session of the pan-Serb parliament.
Mr Vojislav Seselj, the extremist leader of the Radicals, brushed aside the
declaration adopted by the deputies from the Yugoslav, Serbian and
Montenegrin parliaments. He described the declaration as invalid.
The declaration criticised the Bosnian Serbs for ignoring the interests of
the people of Serbia and Montenegro. It also criticised the referendum, to
be held among Bosnian Serbs this weekend, on the grounds that people would
not be able to vote freely in the war conditions.
In the hastily organised referendum, Bosnian Serbs are likely to confirm
rejection of the peace plan by the defiant leaders of their self-styled Serb
state.
Diplomats in Belgrade believe most people will vote against the Vance-Owen
plan, which calls for the division of Bosnia into ten provinces along ethnic
lines. In a second qustion, Bosnian Serbs are also expected to vote in
favour of independence for their self-proclaimed Serb state, with the right
to link up with 'other nations and states'.
The referendum will take place in impoverished towns and villages,
destroyed, heavily damaged or abandoned, in the self-proclaimed Srpska
Republic, which covers about two-thirds of Bosnia. It includes the bulk of
eastern Bosnia, which under the Vance-Owen plan has been designated a
'Moslem province', adhering to the mostly Moslem structure of the pre-war
population.
But Moslems will not be voting in the referendum: most were expelled or
killed by Serb forces last spring when they seized control of eastern
Bosnia. Besieged for 13 months, Gorazde is the only remaining Moslem
stronghold in eastern Bosnia.
Some 500,000 Bosnian Serbs who have sought refuge in Serbia in theory are
supposed to vote, but it is unclear what arrangements have been made. The
Belgrade government is unlikely to allow voting.
The number of voters has not been determined. There were about 1.4m Serbs in
Bosnia before the war.
Voting lists are impossible to regulate. On Thursday night, Mr Petar Cancar,
chief of the referendum commission, admitted he did not know the number of
voters and that additional consultations were needed.
The likely No vote on the peace plan will further deepen the split between
Belgrade and Serb kinsmen in Bosnia.
Under threat of military intervention and tough new sanctions by the
international community, President Milosevic has told Serbs they have won
the war and should accept the peace plan. But confronted by another failure
to subdue his disobedient creations, Mr Milosevic is bound to tighten
further the noose on 'Srpska Republika'. But reflecting the hardening of
attitudes, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said: 'It is now quite
obvious that we are not puppets of Milosevic.'

FT  15 MAY 93 / Major seeks to calm Tory nerves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor and ALISON SMITH

<DATELINE>
   EDINBURGH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night began the painful process of rebuilding his
political authority by promising to deliver sustained economic recovery,
radical reform of public services and a tough campaign against crime.
In a speech to the Scottish Conservative Conference which mingled contrition
for past mistakes with a pledge that his government would 'stick to its
principles', the prime minister acknowledged openly the scale of last week's
election defeats.
After a week that has seen two significant government U-turns, he admitted
that a small 18-seat majority in the House of Commons would force the
government into occasional climbdowns: 'We may have to tack a little here,
manoeuvre a little there. That's politics.'
In an attempt to calm the panic in Tory ranks which has raised questions
over his leadership, he said his supporters should not 'over-react'. The
government still had four years to 'take through our programme of
modernising Britain'.
As cabinet colleagues talked of drawing a line under the county council and
Newbury by-election defeats and the subsequent U-turns over education and
unit fines, Mr Major added: 'We Conservatives know all about fightbacks. And
today once more we are coming out fighting.'
Mr Major made only a passing reference to Mr Norman Lamont, praising the
chancellor's 'determination', 'skill' and 'guts'. But he reinforced
expectations of a summer cabinet reshuffle by adopting a conspicuously more
contrite tone than Mr Lamont about the unemployment, bankruptcies and house
repossessions caused by recession.
Acknowledging that the government's political future hinged on a durable
economic recovery, Mr Major said the government would match its
determination to contain inflation with a drive to build a stronger
manufacturing base. He told the conference: 'No more boom and no more bust.
We are going for steady non-inflationary growth.'
In a swipe at the Tory opponents of the Maastricht treaty - it was easy to
play John Bull in a china shop - the prime minister insisted that Britain's
economic interests were linked inextricably to maintaining its influence in
Europe. Instead of 'principled opposition' to Europe, he wanted to 'hear
more in the future about principled support for Europe'.
Mr Major said that, alongside economic recovery, improvements in public
services, the widening of individual choice, providing the 'best education
possible' in schools and a new war against crime would dominate the
government's agenda.
Alison Smith writes: Earlier, Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, attacked Mr
Major's administration as the weakest and most incompetent government in
living memory. 'They simply lurch from one catastrophe to the next, leaving
chaos and dismay in their wake,' he told the Fire Brigades Union at
Bridlington. 'Public tolerance of the government is ebbing with the speed of
a rip-tide.'

FT  15 MAY 93 / Pay deal reached with unions in eastern Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRIKES which have threatened to paralyse industry in eastern Germany
are likely to be called off next week after unions and employers reached a
compromise yesterday on pay rises.
Agreement was reached in principle on equalising pay rates between east and
west German workers by 1996, instead of 1994 as promised in an earlier
agreement. The deal followed 21 hours of negotiations in the Saxon capital
of Dresden between Gesamtmetall, the metal and electrical employers'
association, and IG Metall, the engineering union.
There was relief in Bonn that the prospect of a prolonged and damaging
dispute had been averted. But the deal will significantly increase wage
costs for eastern industry, already uncompetitive, and could have a damaging
effect on foreign investment in the region. The strikes have already
affected more than 90 enterprises and 40,000 workers.
The union will ballot its members in the five eastern German states early
next week, using the Saxony compromise as a basis. The strikes, the first in
eastern Germany for more than 60 years, were aimed at forcing employers to
reinstate a contract, signed with the union in March 1991 which would have
equalised western and eastern German wages next year. This would have meant
pay increases of 26 per cent for eastern Germany's metal and electrical
sectors, and 21 per pay rises for its steel sector.
Eastern German wages are currently about 68 per cent of western German
levels.
The employers said they pulled out of the contract because of deteriorating
economic conditions nationally and persistent low levels of productivity in
the east, which lag behind the west by about 70 per cent. IG Metall accused
employers of breaking the contract to erode the traditional system of
collective wage bargaining, and turn eastern Germany into a low-wage
economy.
Yesterday's agreement, mediated by Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the prime minister of
Saxony, reinstates the principle of the contract, but in a substantially
modified form. Income parity has been put back to mid-1996. At the same
time, eastern German wages will rise to 80 per cent of western German levels
by next December, instead of last April.
These pay increases will be phased in on July 1, when they will rise to 75
per cent, and to 77 per cent on September 1. In practice, they reflect an
annual pay increase of about 15 per cent. Gesamtmetall, which had said it
would never reinstate the principle of the contract, also failed to obtain
an unconditional 'opt-out' clause for enterprises that could not afford to
pay these increases. Instead, they will negotiate at local level.
Neither side appeared jubilant. Mr Hans Peter Munter. Gesamt-metall's main
negotiator, said the agreement 'was a painful compromise'.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Crackdown on private briefings for analysts: Stock exchange
censures LIG over leaking of information
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Stock Exchange yesterday cracked down publicly for the first time
on the selective leaking of sensitive information.
In a highly unusual move, the exchange publicly censured London
International Group, the condoms to photo processing company, for revealing
important information to a group of analysts and institutions rather than to
the market generally.
The ruling raises questions about what some see as 'cosy' relationships
between companies and analysts, and how analysts are often guided towards a
company's expected profits or losses.
The City reacted with unease to the ruling, which it believes could signal a
general tightening of approach by the authorities and change the way
information flows from companies to investors.
'It's a very fine line, and this will make the job of running a company or
being an analyst much more difficult,' a merchant banker said.
City professionals said the exchange's rebuke to LIG would force companies
to review how they release price-sensitive information. One observer said
the case could result in greater use of public announcements for releasing
information, and fewer private briefings for analysts.
The exchange said that an unnamed LIG employee, believed to be below
director level, was told by the company's board to release certain
information about its trading performance.
On February 1 this year, the employee spoke separately by telephone to 13
analysts and four of the company's largest institutional shareholders and
told them their profit expectations for LIG were too high. At least three
times he exceeded the board's instructions by indicating the extent to which
forecasts should be lowered, the exchange said.
Late that morning, LIG's shares started falling and ended the day down 22p,
or 8 per cent, at 248 1/2 p. The exchange started an insider dealing
investigation after the price fall and complaints from brokers who had not
been contacted by the company.
The exchange said yesterday that both the information the board wanted
disclosed, as well as the unauthorised information, should have been sent
first to the exchange's announcement office. It added, though, that there
was no evidence of insider dealing.
Under exchange rules, companies should release all material and price
sensitive information through the announcements office. This means that all
investors receive information at the same time and prevents a false market.
Analysts involved in the case said the profit warning concerned LIG's photo
processing division, which they said was difficult to assess because of
seasonal factors such as Christmas. The only way to judge the division's
performance, and therefore LIG's total profits, was from hints made by the
company, they said. 'There was always quite a lot of hand-holding,' said
one.
One banker said the exchange appeared to be tightening up on what was
previously a 'grey area'. Companies regularly give out information, which is
sometimes price-sensitive, but LIG was unlucky because its shares fell, he
said.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Japanese chief accused over BP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN executive with C. Itoh, the Japanese engineering company, corruptly paid
middlemen to acquire confidential information to win lucrative North Sea oil
contracts from British Petroleum, Southwark Crown Court heard yesterday.
Mr Shigiki Furutate, probably with the connivance of his company, tried to
cheat BP's tendering system by offering money for information obtained from
staff at BP's procurement division, said Mr Stephen Batten QC, prosecuting
for the Serious Fraud Office.
Mr Furutate denies three charges of conspiracy to defraud BP. His trial is
expected to last four weeks.

A MANAGEMENT-led investment consortium will buy Coldwell Banker Residential
Group, the residential property arm of US retailing group Sears, Roebuck, Mr
Edward Brennan, Sears chairman, announced at the annual meeting yesterday.
The sale represents a further step in Sears' strategy to scale down its
involvement in financial services and focus on its core retailing business.
The Fremont Group, formerly Bechtel Investments, will purchase the Coldwell
Banker Residential Group, with senior management executives at Coldwell
Banker, led by Mr Chandler Barton, chairman, participating in the deal.
Sears did not disclose the sale price, but there were indications yesterday
that the proceeds, together with the Dollars 328m obtained for Sears'
mortgage banking unit, would reach approximately Dollars 500m.
Sears announced the sale of Sears Mortgage Banking Group, previously part of
the Coldwell Banker division, to PNC Bank earlier this week.
Coldwell Banker, which has more than 2,100 residential real estate offices
in North America, made a net loss of Dollars 7.7m in the first quarter. It
was founded in 1906 and acquired by Sears, Roebuck in 1981, when the
Chicago-based group started to expand into financial services.
The Fremont Group is a private investment corporation that manages more than
Dollars 3.5bn in assets worldwide. Through Fremont Investment Advisers, the
company manages more than Dollars 2.5bn in securities portfolios and mutual
funds.
Mr Brennan told shareholders that 'the successful completion of this
transaction, plus the sale of Sears Mortgage Corp announced earlier this
week are initial steps in our repositioning programme which will continue to
enhance shareholder value.'
Sears has already announced plans to float a 20 per cent interest in its
Allstate insurance unit next month.
Mr Brennan said Allstate would be the largest publicly-traded 'personal
lines' insurance company in the US. After the offering, the remaining 80 per
cent of Allstate's equity will be owned by Sears.

FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: SB forges more links in US drugs promotion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INCREASING trend towards co-promotional ventures between pharmaceuticals
groups continued yesterday when SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American
group, and Janssen, the drugs subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, agreed to
co-promote two of their drugs.
Under the agreement, Janssen will co-promote Paxil, SB's selective serotonin
re-uptake inhibitor anti-depressant in the US hospital market. In exchange,
SB will co-promote Risperdal, a novel schizophrenia drug, in the US
psychiatric market.
Paxil, launched in the US in January, is one SB's most important new
products, and competes with Eli Lilly's Prozac, and Pfizer's Zoloft.
Prozac's sales have been hit by concerns about its safety, and even before
the co-promotion deal SB's managers were convinced the group's salesforce
was far more powerful than Pfizer's. The US market is worth about Dollars
1.5bn (Pounds 970m).
Risperdal was registered at the US Food and Drug Administration last year,
and was recommended by an advisory panel in April this year.
The announcement is a blow for Merck, the US group. Last year, SB agreed to
co-promote Zocor, Merck's cholesterol-lowering agent. It had been expected
Merck would co-promote Paxil.

FT  14 MAY 93 / World Trade News: German orders likely, says Qichen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA is likely to place large orders with east German firms, Chinese
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said yesterday, Reuter reports from Bonn.
Speaking to journalists at the end of a three-day visit to Germany, he said
China was pleased that Bonn had barred the sale of warships to Taiwan
earlier this year.
It might buy items such as river barges and railway carriages from east
Germany, Qichen added, but he did not specify the likely size of any orders.
The Bonn government has said German firms are negotiating 300 projects in
China, with a total value running into billions of dollars.
Qichen described his visit, during which he met Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
other leaders, as a success and said relations between the two countries had
entered a new phase.
Germany, eyeing the vast markets of China, has been pushing to normalise
relations since Bonn lifted sanctions imposed in protest at Beijing's
killing of pro-democracy student demonstrators in June 1989.
In January it barred the sale of 10 submarines and 10 frigates worth DM12bn
(Dollars 7.4bn) to Taiwan for fear of angering China, which disputes
Taiwan's sovereignty.
German government sources said they could not exclude the possibility that
Kohl might accept a long-standing invitation to visit China but no date had
been fixed.
The German branch of the human rights group Amnesty International said the
human rights situation in China remained serious, with torture common in
prisons and the number of executions rising alarmingly.
Shanghai Airlines, China's first independent airline, yesterday ordered five
Boeing 767-300 widebody jets worth Dollars 450m, adds Paul Betts.
The deal follows the order last month by Civil Aviation Administration of
China (CAAC) for 20 Boeing 737 and one 757 aircraft for a total of Dollars
800m.

FT  14 MAY 93 / World Trade News: China lays on an Olympian reception - Tony
Walker loses count of the accolades heaped on visiting IOC president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'SAMA-WHIRLWIND sweeps Shanghai' said the headline in the Chinese newspaper.
This was not a reference to a freak storm but to the presence of a man who
has been elevated by China's official press to the status of a demigod.
Juan Antonio Samaranch, President of International Olympic Committee for the
past 12 years, has been buried under gifts and honours as Chinese leaders
fell over each other to pay their respects.
To the Chinese, desperate to secure the nomination for the 2000 Olympics as
an affirmation of their growing world importance, Mr Samaranch's presence
has afforded an opportunity to influence the man whom they believe holds the
key to hearts and minds of the 90 IOC delegates who will vote on the
nomination.
China's Samaranch-fever, in all its astonishing manifestations, is the most
visible aspect of an intensifying diplomatic and public relations blitz as
Beijing and Sydney ' clear frontrunners to stage the 2000 Olympics ' settle
down for a contest that will come to an end on September 23 when the winner
is announced in Monte Carlo.
While both Australian and Chinese officials insist in public that they are
intent pursuing the contest in true Olympic spirit, there is no doubt that
at another level they are engaged in 'no holds barred' competition.
On hand in China this week to witness the deification of Mr Samaranch were
Australians Mr Kevan Gosper, an IOC vice-president, Mr John Coates President
of the Australian Olympic Committee, and Mr Phil Coles, an IOC delegate.
Among their tasks was to sign a 'truce' to smooth any bumps in relations
beteween the two Olympic Committees as the bidding war intensifies.
But scarcely was ink dry on the agreement that provides for enhanced
co-operation and sporting exchanges than representatives of both sides were
seeking to undermine each other's claims. Australian officials mumbled about
Beijing's pollution, China's indifferent human rights record, traffic snarls
in the capital, and the poor maintenance of some of China's sporting
facilities.
The Chinese, for their part, stepped up their diplomatic blitz with their
fawning reception of Mr Samaranch and their heavy emphasis on China's size
and weight. The implication here is that the IOC can hardly deny the wishes
of one-fifth of mankind to host the world's premier sporting event.
On the record, representatives of the two sides are being determinedly
sporting. Mr Coates said the Australian Olympic Committee hoped that the
competition could be conducted in a 'friendly' atmosphere.
The opening of the inaugural East Asian games in Shanghai involved thousands
of performers in a mass synchronised display that went off like clockwork, a
spectacular fireworks show designed by a French specialist and a crowd of
30,000 who accorded Mr Samaranch a standing ovation when he appeared in the
stadium.
Mr Samaranch could be forgiven for experiencing something of an anti-climax
when he travels to Australia later this week after being feted in Shanghai
and latterly in Beijing.
Sydney's press is unlikely to clear its front pages to detail Mr Samaranch's
every move in contrast to his treatment one day this week by the Beijing
Daily which carried almost nothing but 'Sama-stories' on its front and back
pages.
China's official 'Outlook magazine' almost certainly outdid its competitors
in its praise for Mr Samaranch. 'His achievements,' the magazine told its
readers, 'are simply too many to count.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NON-ALIGNED ministers yesterday ended a three-day meeting abandoning the
polemics of the past and declaring war on the developing world's 'crippling
crisis of indebtedness', Reuter reports from Nusa Dua.
The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), seeking to end its traditional hectoring of
western nations, issued a final press communique full of calls for greater
self-help and a two-way partnership between rich and poor nations.
Mr Ali Alatas, Indonesian foreign minister and chairman of the gathering,
acknowledged the movement's past faults and offered a vision focused on
improving the lot of its members.
'We have indeed learned the precious lessons of our past experiences in
economic and social fields. Accordingly we have reassessed and determined
our strategy in a vastly changed international situation. . . in order to
solve the global economic problems of our time,' he said.
Ministers from Africa, Asia, the Americas and Europe, ending their gathering
on the island resort of Bali, presented an agenda based on modest but
specific measures.
Delegates said attempts by Pakistan, North Korea and Palestine to insert
their own unilateral issues into a final document were swept aside.
Instead the meeting, attended by 74 countries, discussed ways of starting a
dialogue with the rich North and of promoting ties among its own members.
Ministers backed an initiative by current NAM chairman Indonesia to have
President Suharto address a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial
countries in Tokyo in July on behalf of the movement. The G7 has so far been
lukewarm about the proposal.
The communique called for at least three panels of experts to be set up to
collate data on debt, development and food but stopped short of recommending
an economic summit as suggested by some delegates.
Of particular concern are the massive debts - which last year touched
Dollars 1,400bn - hanging over members.
Ministers also called for a boosting of growth in the South, which would in
turn foster a net transfer of financial resources to debtor countries to
prevent poorer nations falling back into a vicious cycle of debt.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Peace is imposed on a still troubled Punjab: With it comes
the first stirrings of economic revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR ago Mr Madan Singh Bharara, the owner of a bicycle factory in India's
troubled north-western state of Punjab, could run only one shift a day. His
workers would travel to work only by daylight for fear of being attacked by
the Sikh insurgents who had terrorised the Punjab for nearly a decade.
But last summer, Mr Bharara was able to start a second shift. And this
winter a third. 'People are not frightened any more. Even migrant workers
are coming back from other states.'
Peace is returning to the Punjab. In the first four and a half months of
this year 38 died in terrorist attacks, compared with 1,518 last year and
2,591 in 1991. And with peace are coming the first stirrings of a economic
revival.
But many Punjabis are still wary because terrorism has been suppressed only
by one of the toughest police campaigns seen in India. There are doubts
whether such an enforced peace can last unless the central government also
tries to settle the grievances which first drove the militants to arms. As a
Sikh senior official of the Punjab state government says: 'Sikh frustrations
are still there.'
Sikhs dominate the Punjab, a fertile and wealthy state where they account
for 70 per cent of the population, but are a small minority in the country
as a whole. Sikhs often do well, especially in the army and the civil
service, but still believe their state gets less than its fair share of the
national pie.
Sikh frustrations led to a growing separatist movement which Mrs Indira
Gandhi's government attempted to suppress in 1984 with Operation Bluestar -
the storming of the Golden Temple in Amritsar, the Sikhs' holiest shrine.
Outraged Sikhs reacted by giving support to militant groups demanding an
independent Sikh state of Khalistan.
As late as 1991, it seemed that there was little the central government
could do to turn back the tide, especially as the militants were getting aid
from inside Pakistan. While the security forces managed to keep a grip on
the cities, terrorists had the run of large swathes of countryside.
But everything changed in late 1991 with the advent as police chief of Mr K
P S Gill, himself a Sikh and one steeped in the Sikhs' traditional love of
battle. He relished the opportunity to fight for control of his home state,
pitting, as he once said, one group of Sikh warriors (the police) against
another (the militants).
Mr Gill turned conventional wisdom on its head by withdrawing the army from
frontline positions and replacing it with the police. He also armed his men
with semi-automatic weapons and trained them to shoot terrorists.
Mr Gill exploited a growing revulsion with the insurgents among ordinary
Sikhs who grew weary of indisciplined militants indulging in indiscriminate
murder, rape and robbery.
Meanwhile, leaders of the Akali, the Sikh political organisation, badly
misjudged their hand in February 1992 when they urged a boycott of state
elections. They claimed success when only 20 per cent of voters turned out.
But it was a pyrrhic victory since the new non-Akali government backed Mr
Gill to the hilt.
Mr Gill, who has earned national note as the hard man of the Punjab, roundly
declares that the Punjab is now the safest state in India since the
suppression of terrorism has brought with it a marked decline in general
crime.
Sikh political leaders say safety has come at a high price. 'If we have
peace, it is the peace of the grave,' says Mr Gurtej Singh, a militant
activist with close knowledge of the armed groups.
Mr Ajit Singh Bains, a former high court judge and chairman of a human
rights watchdog committee, says: 'Kidnapping by the police, rapes and
extra-judicial executions are the order of the day. The Golden Temple is
still surrounded by the security forces.'
Mr Gill raises his eyes at the mention of police excesses. 'Ah, the human
rights question,' he says disdainfully. He says that individual police
officers have been punished and even prosecuted for using excessive force,
but there is no question of any general breakdown in police discipline.
'Order has been maintained.'
Most Punjabis are less interested in Mr Gill's methods than in his results.
In Chandigarh, in nearby villages and in Ludhiana, the state's industrial
centre, the overwhelming feeling is of relief that terrorism seems beaten.
Mr Hakem Singh, an Akali member and a municipal councillor in Ludhiana,
says: 'People used to have sympathy for the militants and they were also
afraid. Now they are glad the threat has almost gone.'
A key issue is jobs in the Punjab, especially for educated youths who no
longer want to stay on their parents' farms and who might be tempted to
become militants.
Agricultural output in the Punjab kept growing steadily throughout the
1980s. But industrial growth fell from 10 per cent a year in the late 1970s
to below 5 per cent. Now Mr A S Chattha, the state's chief secretary,
expects a strong recovery. He accepts that it will be time before
industrialists make large investments in the Punjab, but there is great
scope for smaller projects, including engineering workshops and foundries,
hosiery mills and battery farms.
Even when terrorism was at its height, the above-average skills of Punjabi
workers tempted Fujitsu, the Japanese electronics group, into establishing a
modest joint venture factory to produce telecommunications equipment.
Pepsico, the US food and drinks conglomerate, built a food processing plant.
In his bicycle factory, Mr Bharara says that until three months ago, his
foreign customers refused to see him in the Punjab; meetings were held in
Bombay. Now they have started visiting Ludhiana.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Argentina repeals controversial 'disobedience' law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S Congress has repealed a century-old 'disobedience' law used by
civilian and military governments - including the present government of
President Carlos Menem - to muzzle press criticism and intimidate public
opinion.
The Senate voted unanimously on Wednesday to scrap the law. Mr Menem
formally proposed repealing it last July in response to attacks on his use
of the measure. The law's last victim was a woman arrested making an obscene
gesture at Mr Menem.
President Juan Peron greatly strengthened 19th-century statutes that made
insulting the dignity or decorum of an official a criminal offence. In 1950,
Peron extended the scope of disobedience, or desacato, to undermine
congressional immunities, close newspapers, and jail political opponents.
Although Argentina returned to civilian rule in 1983, the disobedience law
remained an obstacle to full press and political freedom.
Mr Menem's critics admit he never jailed an opponent or closed a newspaper,
but say he has used the threat of legal action as a form of intimidation. Mr
Menem has replied to these complaints by doing away with the law. However,
opponents are still not satisfied. They say Mr Menem and other politicians
abuse slander, libel and defamation laws to silence criticism.
Mr Luis Moreno Ocampo, a former federal prosecutor, says Mr Menem is
paradoxically introducing overdue reforms of the political and legal system
 -such as repealing the disobedience law - while concentrating power in his
hands and dismantling constitutional checks and balances on the government.
Mr Menem is to meet President Bill Clinton in Washington next month,
Argentina's Foreign Ministry has announced. The two presidents are to meet
on June 29 for talks on trade, security and bilateral issues.

FT  14 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: GrandMet busy

<TEXT>
Results at the top end of market expectations were reported by Grand
Metropolitan, although profit-taking after the recent run saw the shares
finish 11 off at 422p. There were a few aspects to worry an otherwise
largely supportive market, with US food business Green Giant again having to
extend its recovery timetable. There were also currency considerations, one
of the main reasons that most analysts made modest downgrades to the Pounds
960m level for next year.
Figures from BT caused unease in the market as dealers and specialists
attempted to analyse the wealth of statistics. While most agreed that the
pension fund issue was bad for sentiment as well as finances, the overall
feeling was that the underlying business was performing well.
The shares fell 7 at the opening, then rebounded 11 to move into positive
territory before settling just 1 1/2 up at 404p. Turnover was an above
average 9.2m. Analysts said that, given the good underlying performance and
the upcoming campaign for the BT III sale, the shares appear well favoured.
The annual analysts meeting with Rank Organisation, ahead of the group going
into closed period, helped the shares to recover some of Wednesday's nervous
decline and they closed 4 up at 700p. There were few great surprises on
trading, with Japan continuing weak and some worries over the onset of
recession in the rest of Europe. But UK and US trading was continuing to
show signs of an upturn, in particular the UK holiday market.
Analysts'forecasts moved into a range of Pounds 255m to Pounds 265m for the
first half of 1993.
Ever-present sensitivity to Aids news was responsible for a sharp fall in
Wellcome. Positive references to an anti-Aids compound being developed for
Glaxo sent the shares down 30 at worst, before recovering slightly to end 24
off at 742p. SmithKline Beecham also suffered in spite of a well-received
announcement that it had agreed a joint promotion in the US with a unit of
Johnson &amp; Johnson, the 'A' shares declining 15 to 466p. Glaxo held
relatively steady, closing only 5 lower at 638p.
Scientific equipment group Life Science rose 6 to 142p as it announced a
Pounds 33.5m acquisition and agency broker James Capel turned positive.
Results from Burton Group saw the shares advance strongly, closing 4 to the
good at 85p in turnover of 12m. While many analysts felt that the company
has managed to turn the corner, there was some concern raised over its
ability to compete with other retail brands and the subsequent pressure on
margins. Next, an arch competitor, put on 6 1/2 at 164 1/2 p.
Positive presentations in London from Procter &amp; Gamble and Nestle yesterday
were seen to augur well for Unilever's results today. The shares advanced 14
to 1104p.
RTZ rose 11 to 636p, buoyed by a bounce in copper, which has seen chronic
weakness this year, and gold.
Lonrho had a busy session as 20m shares were dealt and firmed 4 to 118 1/2 p
on talk that the company was planning to float its 73 per cent-owned Western
Platinum concern in South Africa.
Pearson recovered 4 to 439p as SG Warburg published a buy recommendation.
The securities house was also recommending Scottish Television in its sector
review, arguing that the shares deserve to reach 520p in the short term.
They added 6 at 457p. Also, it is advising more adventurous investors to
look at debt-laden PR group Shandwick on the basis that at 33p the shares
are on a 50 per cent discount to a 1994 market rating. Shandwick rose 1 1/2
to 20 1/2 p.
Carlton Communications continued to resist broad-based support, including a
late recommendation from agency broker James Capel, which pointed out a
positive article in the trade press. Carlton lost 8 to 719p.
Turnover in Rolls-Royce surged to 14m and the shares jumped 10 1/2 to 149p
as the market appreciated Wednesday's news of an engine order from Boeing.
Sentiment was further boosted by news of a Korean Air deal. Dealers reported
switching from British Aerospace and into Rolls-Royce. BAe shed 8 to 317p in
trade of 1.9m.
The large line of Smiths Industries stock held by UBS that had been
overhanging the market was cleared yesterday. The shares rose 8 to 343p.
Simon Engineering continued to plunge, losing 21 to 52 1/2 p yesterday after
Smith New Court weighed in with a savage profits downgrading.
Magazine printer HunterPrint rose 5 to 80p as it brought forward its results
amid company concern that the shares had risen from 60 earlier in the week.
HunterPrint said it was in talks over a bid and St Ives was mentioned in the
market as a possible candidate. St Ives, very heavily traded after the
departing chairman and shareholders connected with him placed 6.7m shares
with S. G. Warburg, fell 6 to 324p on 13.6m traded.

FT  14 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Zeneca shunned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors continued to shun Zeneca, the bioscience side of the soon to be
demerged ICI. However, at least one leading securities house was arguing
that Zeneca offered good value.
Agency broker James Capel believes that the ICI new shares have been
overvalued and, although there are some long-term worries with Zeneca, it
may not be receiving the sector rating it deserves. Williams de Broe has
also told clients it believes the Zeneca price is too low. Nevertheless, the
majority view held sway yesterday and ICI new gained 14 at 623p while Zeneca
ex-rights lost 16 to 648p and the nil-paid shed 13 1/2 to 52 1/2 p. Existing
ICI fell 5 1/2 to 1279p.

FT  14 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Properties advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Property shares surged on news from Land Securities that its net asset value
(nav) was well ahead of market forecasts. However, property specialists
cautioned against taking this as a signal for the rest of the sector,
warning that the recovery in the commercial property market could prove
highly selective. Land Securities added 6 at 551p, while British Land
advanced 14 to 282p, Hammerson 'A' 6 to 306p and MEPC 12 to 418p.
Land's surprise nav  - 504p per share against 555p a year earlier and a
market forecast of around 490p  - was achieved through an improvement in its
central London office yields. But analysts said this was restricted to
selected well-located properties and that part of the market remained
heavily overlet.
Mr Marc Gilbard at NatWest Securities said that yesterday's strong
performance across the sector has been a knee-jerk reaction and that
investors should concentrate on companies  - such as Land Securities  -
which are aiming to improve cash flow. 'What Lands has to do is to justify
its new rating by strengthening its cash flow, with a rights issue enabling
it to buy more quality properties,' he said.

FT  14 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shell hits new high on results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST-QUARTER results ahead of even the most optimistic forecasts sent Shell
Transport surging on exceptionally heavy turnover.
Many dealers found it hard to fill the sheer weight of buy orders yesterday
and turnover hit 10m shares by the middle of the morning. At the close, the
shares were through the 600p barrier, ending a net 20 1/2 higher at 612 1/2
p, an all-time peak, with 16m traded. The rise accounted for more than 4
points on the FT-SE 100 Index.
Analysts found it difficult to resist bumping up forecasts. The end-of-year
target was lifted as high as Pounds 3.5bn, with some of the more optimistic
observers arguing that the shares could hit 700p in the short term. Mr Nick
Antill of Hoare Govett, who now predicts Pounds 3.2bn for the year-end and a
dividend of 24.5p, said: 'I think these figures are as good as they look.'

FT  14 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities lower after uncertain
session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECOVERY of confidence in the UK stock market was jolted yesterday by
the turmoil in European currencies and a series of unfavourable economic
data on the US economy. After edging higher at first, the London market
crumbled away in late trading as Wall Street came in with a loss of around
30 Dow points in early deals. Downward pressure increased when a New York
house sold bond futures strongly in London.
With sterling only slightly easier, the UK stock market was shielded from
the worst of the developments in the currency markets. The Bundesbank's
moves to discourage speculation of an impending cut in German interest rates
calmed some of the optimism for a further reduction in UK base rates, which
are now recognised as more closely linked to domestic political factors.
Equities opened firmly on the back of Wall Street's fresh advance overnight
but soon topped out at Footsie 2,867.4 as tensions increased in the currency
sector. The stock market quickly moved into negative territory and remained
there for the rest of the day.
Attempts to rally, as successive hopes of interest rate cuts circulated
before being choked off by the Bundesbank's actions in the German money
markets, proved of limited success. Wall Street's reaction to economic data
threatening inflationary pressure undermined London, which closed at the
day's low in sharply increased trading volume.
The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 Index at 2,849.3 for a net loss of
11.5. But the focus on the Footsie-listed blue chips masked the continued
rise in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which finished 6.9 ahead at 3,151.9, within
three points of its closing peak. During the day, the Mid 250 broke through
its previous closing high, reaching 3,156.8.
Share volume, boosted by heavy trade in Shell Transport following good
first-quarter figures, rose to 797.6m from the 773.6m of the previous
session. Non-Footsie stocks maintained their daily average of around 62 per
cent of the Seaq total.
The rise in Shell was worth about 4 points on the Footsie on a weak day, and
shares in BP were also busy. ICI, however, was much less active, with the
share price finally pulled down by Wall Street's weakness.
Company statements from other sectors might have made more impact but for
the underlying currency and transatlantic uncertainties. The stock market
continues to look to Britain's boardrooms for testimony of economic
recovery.
Property shares, the most recession/interest rate-sensitive area, responded
strongly to higher net asset valuation figures and an increased dividend
from Land Securities. But the broad range of consumer stocks made little
response to results from Grand Metropolitan and Burton Group.
The revival of inflation fears in the US has followed comment in London that
global markets could be open to a correction phase. Demand for gold and
gold-related shares rose again yesterday, underlining suggestions in some
quarters that investors might be looking for either cash or defensive
instruments.
However, NatWest Securities maintained yesterday that the prospect of a '10
to 20 per cent worldwide correction' in equity markets still seems some way
off.

FT  14 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RETURN of a more cautious mood due in part to uncertainty in European
currency markets, and a sizeable selling order, sent stock index futures
into decline, writes Joel Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index opened at 2,877, the same level as
its previous close, and moved swiftly ahead. Within half-an-hour it was
trading at 2,881, at which point it was showing a strong premium to the cash
market. Sentiment was at this stage boosted by the reduction in French
interest rates.
A more cautious mood took hold at mid-morning which started the sporadic
selling, and this gained strength as uncertainty in the cur-rency markets
took hold. However, traders looked to Wall Street to lift sentiment in
London.
Weak US bond markets, due to the disappointing US inflation figures, caused
a poor early performance on Wall Street which led to a further decline in
London. The June contract fell further when a fairly big sell order from a
leading US house was executed, and it touched a low for the day of 2,855.
June closed at 2,860, just three points ahead of its estimated fair value
premium to cash of about 5. Turnover was poor at 7,095 contracts.
In the traded options, volume continued to be healthy, reaching a total of
35,039 lots. The FT-SE 100 option saw 8,584 contracts dealt.

FT  14 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Poor inflation figures
sharply depress Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices fell sharply across the board yesterday after another bad
set of inflation figures sent bond prices tumbling for the second
consecutive day, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 34.32 from Wednesday's closing
record high to end at 3,447.99. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 5.57 at
439.23 and the Nasdaq composite receded 6.05 to 675.64. Trading volume on
the New York SE came to 294m shares.
After Wednesday's unexpectedly strong producer price inflation report,
yesterday it was the turn of the April consumer price index to scare the
markets. The CPI rose 0.4 per cent last month, above expectations, and the
'core' measure of consumer price inflation  - which excludes the volatile
food and energy components  - was also up a worrying 0.4 per cent.
The figures, which suggested that inflation is picking up alongside the
steadily growing economy, rattled Treasury investors, who sold bonds
heavily. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was down well in excess
of a full point, and the yield was back up to almost 6.95 per cent.
The rise in bond yields and the fears of inflation hit stocks from the
opening, bringing the Dow average down sharply. The selling was apparent
across the board, although there was some refuge for investors in gold
shares, which traditionally act as a safe haven in inflationary times, and
metals issues, which are seen as beneficiaries of higher commodities prices.
A group of metals and gold stocks posted strong early gains, although some
late selling left them mixed at the close. Alcoa finished steady at Dollars
66, Newmont Mining climbed Dollars 1 5/8 but ended a net Dollars  1/2 down
at Dollars 50, Phelps Dodge put on Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 46, and
Homestake Mining firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 17 7/8 , all in heavy
trading. On the American Stock Exchange, Pegasus Gold firmed Dollars 1 1/4
to Dollars 22 1/4 and Echo Bay Mines Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 11 1/8 .
Philip Morris bucked the wider market trend, rising Dollars  5/8 to Dollars
50 5/8 on 2.9m shares traded after Merrill Lynch raised its
intermediate-term rating on the stock from 'neutral' to 'above average'.
Motor shares declined in spite of more good news on car and truck sales.
General Motors slipped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 40 1/4 .
On the Nasdaq market, Apple ran against the grain, rising Dollars 2 1/4 to
Dollars 55 1/2 after the company unveiled the updated version of its
cross-platform multimedia architecture software, QuickTime for Windows.
Canada
THE US inflation news spurred solid gains in Canadian gold shares in very
heavy trading and more than offset losses in some other sectors, but
afternoon selling pulled the Toronto market well down from its intraday
high.
The TSE 300 index closed only 4.8 up at 3,801.3. Rises outscored declines by
432 to 322 after volume of 85.8m shares. The golds index rose 3 per cent as
the New York spot gold price climbed USDollars 7.30 an ounce to USDollars
368.55.

FT  14 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Signs of corporate recovery lift Sweden
 -The prospect of new rate cuts has boosted sentiment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Falling interest rates and signs of corporate profits recovery have helped
fuel a stock market rally in Sweden which began last October and is still
going strong.
A further cut in interest rates yesterday added to the positive sentiment;
but profit-taking late in the session saw the Affarsvarlden general index
fall 9.6 to 1,072.1.
Equities have now risen by more than 17 per cent since the start of the
year, and have climbed by some 50 per cent since Sweden effectively devalued
the krona last November. However, prices are still 20 per cent below the
peaks reached in August 1989, before the onset of economic recession.
The devaluation has done much to generate the momentum of the last six
months, not least because the weaker krona has enhanced the competitiveness
of the large export-orientated multinationals.
More recently, it has been expectations of further falls in interest rates
which have dominated sentiment. Following yesterday's cut, the central
bank's marginal interest rate stands at 9.00 per cent, compared with 12.50
per cent at the time the krona was floated. The trend is firmly downward
and, in spite of central bank caution, further cuts can be expected this
summer.
But there are other influences at work, including increased interest by
overseas investors.
Ms Mary Berg, Scandinavian analyst at James Capel in London, comments:
'International investors, who have done well out of Germany and France, are
now looking to put their money somewhere else with both countries moving
into recession. Sweden looks particularly attractive because of its range of
well-known international companies with good recovery prospects.'
In the last two weeks a number of factors have helped to give the market a
further boost. The low wage accord that employers and engineering unions
have agreed looks like averting any widespread industrial unrest in the
current wage bargaining round.
There has also been evidence of improving corporate fortunes in some
first-quarter reports. On Tuesday Ericsson disclosed a SKr428m (Dollars 57m)
profit for the first three months, sharply reversing a SKr363m loss for the
same quarter of 1992. Its 'B' shares closed at SKr300 yesterday, against a
1993 low of SKr172.
Last week Stora, the forestry group, also provided some cause for optimism
when it said that prices for most of its main products had stopped falling
as it announced a lower than expected quarterly loss.
However, forestry shares have still had a disappointing year, moving up by
only 6.4 per cent since January and failing to build on the strong spurt
they put in immediately after the November devaluation. The sector, however,
showed a 6 per cent gain yesterday.
The star performer has been the banking sector, where shares have risen by
more than 90 per cent since the start of the year on hopes that the worst of
Sweden's financial crisis is over. Some of the buying has had a strong
speculative feel to it, as with S-E Banken, whose shares have tripled in the
last month. The sector is still 15 per cent below its level of a year ago.
One clear indication of the general buoyancy has been the increase in
turnover, frequently exceeding SKr1bn a day during the year, and reaching
its second highest level ever on Wednesday when it rose above SKr2bn.
A 'no' vote in next week's Danish referendum on Maastricht would quickly
change sentiment, not least because it would raise the prospect of renewed
currency turbulence. A nervous eye is also being kept on Germany - Sweden's
leading export market - because evidence of deeper recession there would
almost certainly harm the recovery prospects of the country's big
multinationals.
The superstitious recall that it was almost exactly a year ago that the
Affarsvarlden index touched a 1992 high of 1,000 before plunging 37 per cent
in the next five months. This time such a reversal looks unlikely given the
downward trend in interest rates and a feeling that the end of recession has
to be nearer today than it was a year ago.

FT  14 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Devaluation supports Madrid,
Lisbon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE likelihood of a devaluation of the peseta and escudo, confirmed after
the close of trading, had an electrifying effect on trading in the Spanish
and Portuguese equity markets yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
MADRID took off, the general index closing 9.96 or 4.1 per cent higher at
251.81 as the Spanish government's request for a peseta realignment
encouraged estimates of a 5 to 10 per cent currency devaluation, and hopes
of interest rate cuts.
Turnover soared, reaching an estimated Pta64bn against Wednesday's
Pta27.72bn (including Pta11.23bn for Argentaria on its first day of
trading), and an average of around Pta11bn last week.
Mr Craig Prime at FG in Madrid said that Argentaria had brought banks into
the spotlight, but that interest rate speculation had given them lift-off
yesterday with Santander and Popular in the lead, up Pta480 or 9.2 per cent
to Pta5,670, and Pta830, or 5.8 per cent to Pta15,150.
Construction stocks were generally strong, Dragados gaining Pta135, or 7.6
per cent to Pta1,920; and Repsol put on Pta190, or 6.4 per cent to Pta3,140
on satisfaction with its first quarter results.
LISBON also witnessed high turnover, some three times as large as normal, as
a devaluation of the escudo seemed likely. The BTA index climbed more than 1
per cent to close at 1,732.3.
Mr John Ferreira of Carnegie International commented that expectations of a
substantial fall in the April inflation figure, due for release today, had
also helped lift the market.
FRANKFURT extended a rally founded on a recovery from an oversold position,
the strong dollar, firm bond markets and continued hopes of a further cut in
key interest rates. The DAX index rose another 10.33 to 1,639.79 in turnover
of DM6.6bn.
General strength in banks, with Commerzbank and Dresder up DM5 to DM285.50,
and DM7.60 to DM391.60 respectively, backed up the bond market/interest rate
argument.
Degussa and Metallgesellschaft rose by DM7.80 to DM335, and by DM9.90 to
DM321.90, reflecting a recovery from bombed-out levels and the hope that the
gold price surge will reflect on sentiment.
Wella, the haircare products group, produced good figures and took a thin
share price up DM15.50 to DM705.
PARIS made a moderate gain after the Bank of France cut money market rates.
The CAC-40 index recorded a gain of 7.26 to 1,879.93 in average turnover of
FFr2.5bn.
Companies with exposure to Spain were affected by expectations of a imminent
devaluation of the peseta: Carrefour slipped FFr43 to FFr2,629 and Promodes
FFr9 to FFr756.
Bouygues, which holds a 25 per cent stake in TF1, the television network,
lost FFr15 or 2.4 per cent to FFr624 after the government said that it
wanted to lift the limit on single shareholdings in television stations. TF1
advanced FFr21.90 to FFr458.20.
MILAN put in an unexpectedly strong performance which was attributed to
short-covering ahead of today's end of the monthly account and lingering
hopes by many investors that the Bank of Italy might move to cut interest
rates this weekend.
The Comit index added 6.35 to 540.44, led higher by rallies in Stet, the
state telecommunications group, and Fiat.
Stet surged L157 or 5.8 per cent to L2,834, for a two day rise of 8.2 per
cent, on strong foreign demand after a bullish profits forecast at a
briefing for analysts on Wednesday.
ZURICH met resistance as the SMI index tried to rally through the 2,200
level. After a firm start which had seen the index 12.0 ahead at 2,203.9,
profit-taking left prices 9.2 easier on the day at 2,182.7.
Zurich Insurance certificates added SFr35 to SFr1,115 in the wake of plans
to switch them into bearers, which shed SFr40 to SFr2,250.
Roche certificates dipped SFr10 to SFr4,480 amid some switching into other
pharmaceuticals. Miss Virginia Pascoe of Williams de Broe noted that the
company's market capitalisation had, for the first time, overtaken that of
Nestle, prompting some of the recent demand as investors increased their
weighting in the stock.
AMSTERDAM registered a fall in spite of a strong performance from Royal
Dutch, up Fl 4.40 at Fl 167.80, following strong first quarter results. The
CBS Tendency index lost 1.0 to 108.1.
DUBLIN was supported by the Bank of Ireland, up 3 per cent to IPounds 2.44,
after announcing an unexpected dividend increase. The ISEQ index finished
17.24 higher at 1,560.55.
ISTANBUL's 75-share index added 396.6 or 5 per cent to a new record close of
8,349.31. Mr Stuart Harley of Schroders credited reports of heavy
subscription in new mutual funds, and an increasingly stable political
outlook.

FT  14 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region sets more records
as Nikkei declines again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WAYNE APONTE

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT buying through public funds failed to spark a sustained rally and
profit-taking took the Nikkei average into a third consecutive decline,
writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The Nikkei ended 82.42 easier at 20,532.78, after a day's high of 20,780.14
and low of 20,457.38. The broader Topix index of all first section shares
gained 2.12 at 1,611,06. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 3.94 firmer
at 1,246.29.
Volume was estimated at 550m shares, compared with Wednesday's final 572m.
Rises led declines by 548 to 494, with 144 issues unchanged.
Brokers attributed the decline in the Nikkei to dealer positioning before
today's special quotation for May Nikkei options contracts, which is
computed from the opening prices of all 225 Nikkei index stocks.
However, the expiry is expected to have a limited effect on the cash market.
The surge in trading volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange
during the past three months has the capacity to absorb erratic price
swings.
The broader indices, which ended the session in positive territory,
indicated an overall firmness in the stock market, brokers said. The
Nikkei's most recent downturn, they added, has resulted primarily from
selling led by the futures markets, rather than from a reduction in cash
market holdings. Further declines are expected in the absence of compelling
incentives on the buy side; but few brokers yesterday anticipated that this
would bring the Nikkei below the 20,000 level.
Investors are awaiting the release of Japanese corporate earnings reports
later this month, hoping to capitalise on any surprises. Foreign exchange
and economic considerations, meanwhile, should remain the focus of
attention.
The rise in the gold price generated interest in the mining sector. Sumitomo
Metal Mining, the day's most active issue, rose Y80 to Y1,110, a new peak
for the year.
Reports that Nippon Telegraph and Telephone will file for government
approval to increase domestic telephone charges, possibly by the end of this
month, pushed its shares Y19,000 higher to Y963,000.
The banking sector lost ground: Mitsubishi Bank slipped Y50 to Y2,480, Fuji
Bank Y30 to Y2,000 and Sumitomo Bank Y10 to Y1,990.
In Osaka, the OSE average finished 115.96 higher at 22,888.58 in volume of
22.3m shares.
Roundup
RECORD-BREAKING performances were again seen in some Pacific Rim markets.
HONG KONG registered a second consecutive all-time high, with the
Sino-British agreement on land sales encouraging renewed buying by local and
foreign investors.
The Hang Seng index was up 106.16, or 1.5 per cent, at 7,108.76 after a
record intraday high of 7,130.37. Turnover increased to HKDollars 7.47bn,
second only to the HKDollars 7.7bn record set in April.
HSBC Holdings, recently weak, topped the actives list and jumped HKDollars
2, or 2.8 per cent, to HKDollars 71.50. Hongkong Land rose 80 cents, or 5.4
per cent, to HKDollars 15.50 on rumours that it is selling one of its prime
office towers to Chinese interests.
SINGAPORE saw continued strong foreign demand for blue chips, which took the
Straits Times Industrial index up 30.13 to 1,858.71, its high for the day
and a new record.
SEOUL moved higher on late buying of large-capitalisation shares by
institutional and foreign investors, taking the view that the market's
recent correction was coming to an end. The composite index put on 10.53 at
610.61 in turnover of Won497.4bn (Won336.4bn).
MANILA continued its slide into a fourth day, as blue chips fell further in
the absence of foreign demand and the market paused to consolidate after
last week's steep climb. The composite index shed 9.52 to 1,596.19.
AUSTRALIA began strongly but was undermined by poor jobs data which left the
All Ordinaries index 1.3 down at 1,694.4. NEW ZEALAND followed a similar
pattern and the NZSE-40 index settled just 0.62 up at 1,582.4.
TAIWAN ended lower ahead of a central bank board meeting to discuss monetary
policy. The weighted index lost 53.65, or 1.1 per cent, at 4,664.58.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Iberian currencies are devalued
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH THE Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo fell to the bottom of
their bands against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism
yesterday after their central banks announced plans to devalue the
currencies, writes James Blitz.
The Bank of Spain announced at 09.21 GMT yesterday that it was seeking a
meeting of the EC's monetary committee later that day for a realignment of
the ERM.
It was later announced that there would be an 8 per cent devaluation of the
Spanish peseta and a 6.5 per cent devaluation of the escudo against their
central Ecu rates.
Although dealers had anticipated that the peseta would be devalued either
before or after next month's Spanish elections, the timing of the move took
the markets by surprise.
Previous requests for devaluations have come at weekends, and the timing of
yesterday's move, at the start of an ERM trading day, suggested that the
Bank of Spain had suffered an excessively large drain on reserves when
trying to support the currency earlier in the week.
On Wednesday evening, one dealer at a major London bank said that the Bank
of Spain had spent a large amount of reserves maintaining its exchange rate
against the D-Mark. The Bank also bought back options to sell the German
currency, probably in the knowledge that these would become prohibitively
expensive to hedge after a devaluation.
The Bank of Spain's announcement was followed by strong selling of the
currency, which fell to Pta76.33 against the D-Mark from Wednesday's close
of Pta73.56. The escudo dropped similarly, moving as low as Esc98.23 to the
D-Mark from about Esc92.00 of the previous night.
The Iberian currency crisis had little immediate impact on the ERM as a
whole.
The Danish krone came under some selling pressure in the European afternoon,
being quoted as low as DKr3.8675 per D-Mark at one stage.
However, the overwhelming view in the market appeared to be that the
realignment of the Iberian currencies was a separate issue because of the
fundamental economic weakness of both countries.
According to Mr Avinash Persaud of UBS in London, the fate of both the krone
and the ERM will depend on whether the Danes vote 'no' in Tuesday's
referendum on the Maastricht treaty. 'Pressure on the Danish krone could
blow apart the ERM because there would be no fundamental explanation for
it,' he said.
Elsewhere in the currency markets, the dollar was firmer against the D-Mark
following a surprisingly big 0.4 per cent rise in US April consumer prices.
It closed at DM1.6145 from a previous DM1.6115. In New York the US currency
ended at DM1.6160.
Sterling remained weak, however, amid the poor political situation in the
UK. The pound closed at DM2.4625 from a previous DM2.4700.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Money Markets: European rates fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY market interest rates in Spain and Portugal fell sharply yesterday
after both countries announced that they were suspending obligations to
support their currencies at present parities in the European exchange rate
mechanism, writes James Blitz.
The prospect of both countries carrying out significant devaluations of
their currencies led dealers to think that their central banks would take
the opportunity to reduce interest rates sharply.
In Spain's case, a reduction in the cost of borrowing will be particularly
welcome to the socialist government only three weeks before its general
election.
The three-month interest rate for Spanish pesetas opened at around 17 per
cent, but later dropped to 12.62 per cent. The cost of three-month
Portuguese escudo had fallen to about 15 per cent by the close of trading.
Danish money market rates also fell back yesterday as dealers took the view
that, one way or the other, Denmark will be able to reduce its interest
rates following next week's referendum on the Maastricht treaty. The cost of
three-month Danish krone declined from 10 per cent to 9.40 per cent.
As one dealer put it: 'If Denmark votes yes, the Danes will be able to
profit from the general fall in European rates. If they vote no, the Danes
will leave the ERM and will bring down rates anyway.'
France yesterday lowered both its intervention and five to 10-day lending
rates by 25 basis points, in a move that appeared to symbolise that the
Iberian currency crisis did not affect hard core ERM members.
The intervention rate last night stood at 7.75 per cent and the five to
10-day lending rate at 8.75 per cent.
The move triggered another rise in French franc futures and a fall in cash
market rates. The June French franc con-tract climbed 5 basis points to
close at 92.71. Three-month French francs eased to 7.38 per cent from around
7.50 per cent.
The June Euromark con-tract, however, slipped 3 basis points to end at
92.89. German call money was steady at around 7.72 per cent.
Sterling markets were relatively quiet. The June short sterling contract
retreated 6 basis points to finish at 93.99. In the cash market, three-month
money closed at 5 31/32 per cent, up from a previous 5 per cent. There was a
daily shortage of Pounds 900m.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Explorers get set for diamond
rush
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HANDFUL of companies with diamond mining expertise have been deluged
with inquiries and proposals in the past year following the excitement
generated by discoveries in Canada's North West Territories.
Ashton Mining, the Australian company with a 40.1 per cent stake in the
Argyle diamond mine, the western world's biggest producer in volume terms,
has had more than a dozen offers to analyse, says Mr John Robinson, chief
executive. 'The renewed interest in diamond exploration has flushed out many
opportunities and we have been putting them through a stringent screening
process.'
Mr Robinson, insists that, if all the exploration activity produces a new
diamond mine, it would not destabilise the market. He points out that world
diamond output fell by 3 per cent in value to USDollars 6bn last year and
'production in Russia is falling, Zaire's output is down 25 per cent and in
1993 there has been only a trickle of diamonds from Angola'.
Ashton has settled on three projects in Canada: the Lupin joint venture in
the Northwest Territories where Ashton has the right to buy 51 per cent of a
project covering 6,300 square km (2,400 square miles) in the Slave Lake
province from Pure Gold Resources; some 15,500 sq km in the Peace River
district of Alberta, where Ashton is earning 51 per cent, again from Pure
Gold Resources; and the James Bay venture in Ontario where Ashton can earn
51 per cent from KWG Resources.
Mr Robinson says that all this activity has forced Ashton into an abrupt
switch of emphasis away from gold, in which it was getting more involved,
and towards diamonds. Consequently, the company is to reduce its 90 per cent
shareholding in the Mt Muro gold project in Indonesia which requires about
ADollars 110m to bring into production.
Outside Canada, Ashton is putting together a formal licence application
after signing an agreement in principle for a diamond joint venture with the
government in Karelia, western Russia. The area of the licence covers about
two thirds of the republic.
Ashton has 51 per cent of another diamond project in the Great Lakes area of
Michigan, US, but Mr Robinson says the most prospective area in the
portfolio  - because it is the most advanced  - is in the Northern Territory
of Australia where the company has a 67.7 per cent interest. Samples from
the Merlin prospect in the area last year produced 20 commercial size
diamonds, one in four of them of gem quality and the largest of 2.44 carats.
The Argyle mine's output this year is forecast to be close to the record 39m
carats produced last year, says Mr Robinson, who is in London to talk to
institutional investors.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold price soars to 17-month
high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENZIED BUYING yesterday re-ignited the fire started in the gold market by
high-profile investors Sir James Goldsmith and Mr George Soros. The price
soared in London by nearly 3.5 per cent to USDollars 369.15 a troy ounce,
its highest level for 17 months. Gold started 1993 at a seven-year low of
Dollars 327 an ounce.
'The market is explosive. It has lost contact with reality,' said one
dealer. 'You have to admire what Goldsmith and Soros have achieved with
their incredible hype. But Americans think those guys can walk on water.'
There might be more turmoil in the gold market today, traders warned,
because of options-related activity on the New York Commodity Exchange.
Gold's upward surge was sparked three weeks ago by well-orchestrated
revelations that Mr Soros had bought Dollars 400m of shares in Newmont
Mining, the largest US gold producer, from Sir James who had turned some of
the proceeds into options to buy physical gold.
Since then the price of gold has risen by Dollars 25 an ounce or 7 per cent
and Sir James has sold another 9.5 per cent of Newmont, leaving his personal
holding at 19 per cent.
Traders pointed out that the physical gold market was so small that, once it
began to attract money from investment funds and other big investors, 'there
is nowhere for the price to go but north'.
'It will all end in tears but in the very short term the weight of fund
buying and buying to cover positions by those people who have granted
options can push gold prices up to virtually any level. It is merely a
function of the weight of money,' said Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill
Lynch financial services group.
Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland, pointed out that
the rally was inspired by futures and options activity while buying of
physical gold was dropping steeply. He 'guestimated' that the first 10 per
cent rise in gold's price had knocked 400 tonnes off Middle East demand.
'But that has not stopped bull markets in the past.'

FT  14 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rabbi's blessing worries
regulator - The mystery surrounding an Australian mining share's price surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN Securities Commission is investigating whether the
pronouncements of a 91-year old New York rabbi played a role in a share
buying spree that raised the market value of a small mining company from
ADollars 200m to ADollars 1bn in less than a month.
The commission also wants to know why a diamond strike described as
'significant' by Melbourne-based Great Central Mines is judged uneconomic by
its joint venture partner, Stockdale Prospecting, a subsidiary of De Beers,
the South African mining house.
Australian regulators became interested in Great Central when its share
price rose sharply in March, during a series of US 'roadshow' presentations
by Mr Joseph Gutnick, the chairman. The company's American Depositary
Receipts had just begun trading on the Nasdaq over-the-counter exchange.
The ADR price rose from USDollars 5 on March 10, when Mr Gutnick arrived in
the US, to about Dollars 14 on March 29. The price boom was paralleled in
Australia, where the shares soared from ADollars 4.45 to ADollars 18, mostly
on overseas buying.
Even by the speculative standards applied to exploration companies, the
valuation appeared generous. Great Central, which has no significant
operating income, made a net loss of ADollars 3.9m last year on turnover of
just ADollars 1.2m.
However, the identity of the buyers remains something of a mystery, as is
the reason behind the sudden surge in demand.
One colourful explanation that has surfaced in the US and Australia is that
the buyers were Lubavitcher Jews impressed by a video recording in which
Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson says that gold is there for Mr Gutnick and
urges continued exploration.
Rabbi Schneerson is the Russian-born leader of the ultra-orthodox
Lubavitcher sect, based in the Crown Heights district of New York. The
movement has a worldwide following of about 200,000, and the Rabbi's words
 -disseminated by a large publishing organisation  - carry great weight
among Lubavitchers. Some regard him as a messiah.
But there are two serious flaws in the theory that the video recording
triggered the surge in demand for the shares:
The Rabbi's friendship with Mr Gutnick had been public knowledge among
Lubavitchers since at least 1987, and the video is several years old. It is
not clear why it should suddenly prompt a buying spree.
The video appears not to have been shown at Great Central's roadshows, and
the Rabbi's endorsement was not a major feature. Mr Herb Lanzet, the New
York-based public relations man who arranged the four-city tour, says he did
not see the 'rabbi video' until later, although a separate 'corporate video'
was produced for investors.
If the buyers were not zealous Lubavitchers, who were they? Efforts to
market the stock seem initially to have been confined to a select few. In
Denver, for example, none of the top brokerage houses were invited, nor were
the local gold-mining trade association or big institutional investors.
Mr Roger May, of a small broking house called Schneider Securities, did
receive a telephone call from Mr Lanzet, who was known to his firm, and a
visit from Mr Gutnick. But Mr May says that Great Central's two-man
presentation, made in Schneider's offices, was 'no real hype'.
Mr May bought ADRs for several accounts at USDollars 5.37 1/2 , which were
then sold at USDollars 12. 'Herb and Paul (Mr Lanzet's assistant) said it
was a good thing,' he says.
According to Mr Gutnick, the roadshows were designed to present Great
Central as a serious exploration company with significant prospects in both
gold and diamond mining.
No one disputes that Great Central has a knack for discovering gold mines.
Five years ago it found and then sold the Plutonic deposit in Western
Australia, which produces 200,000 ounces of gold a year. Now it is
evaluating another discovery at nearby Bronze Wing.
But there is controversy about Great Central's claim to have found a
promising diamond deposit on land at Nabberu, not far from Bronze Wing,
where it has a joint exploration arrangement with Stockdale.
Great Central told the Australian Stock Exchange last month that 'four fine
diamonds' had been discovered in what it had earlier described as a 'major
diamond bearing . . . province'.
A few days later, trading in the shares was temporarily suspended at the
company's request, pending the release by Stockdale of an evaluation report
requested by the exchange. When it came, the report said the joint venture
had found kimberlites (diamond bearing rock formations), but 'none . . .
has, thus far, been demonstrated to have economic potential'.
Mr Gutnick, who says the company has never claimed anything more than a
significant prospect at Nabberu, accuses Stockdale of playing down the
significance of the diamond find to protect its own interests in the area.
'De Beers have a reputation for trying to discredit any joint venture
partners that may be a threat to their monopoly,' he says. 'We are convinced
there is a good chance that there is a good quality diamond mine there
because de Beers has told us that."
Stockdale was reluctant to comment, but Mr Robert Danchin, exploration
manager asks why the company would play down the prospects of a potential
mine in which it is a joint venturer.
'I am heartily fed up with the whole business,' he says.
Stockdale's bearish assessment of the diamond prospect has taken some of the
steam out of the shares, but Great Central is still trading at about
ADollars 14, valuing the company at more than ADollars 750m.
Mr Gutnick, meanwhile, is plainly unfazed by the sudden publicity
surrounding his company. He has returned to the US, where he is conducting a
second 'road-trip'. Accompanied by Great Central's geologist and an outside
gem specialist, he has visited Florida, Atlanta, St Louis and is now heading
on to Chicago  - the second visit to the Windy City. This time, Great
Central's ADRs have behaved more sedately, fluctuating around the USDollars
10-mark.

AFRICAN, Caribbean and Pacific developing countries are to seek European
Community help to revive international cocoa and coffee pacts, Reuter
reports from Brussels.
The recent collapse of talks on a new world coffee pact followed the failure
of negotiations on a new cocoa accord with a withholding scheme to support
prices. 'Prices have plummeted since the talks collapsed . . . we are trying
to enlist EC support to revive the accords,' General Ghebray Berhane, ACP
secretary, said yesterday. The ACP states begin a two-day ministerial
meeting in Brussels on Monday.
ACP officials said the loss in cocoa and coffee export earnings since 1985
was equal to the Ecu20bn (Pounds 15.75bn) of aid provided under the third
and fourth Lome Conventions, (1985-90) and (1990-2000), linking the EC with
69 ACP countries.

unveiled

CHINA HAS unveiled plans to liberalise access to its mining sector for
foreign companies in an effort to boost lagging minerals production.
A draft mining law was circulated this week at a conference in Beijing
organised by China's Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources and the
United Nations as a step towards engaging international miners more closely
in China's resource development.
But representatives of mining companies have given the draft a fairly
lukewarm response. The requirement that foreign companies pay 20 per cent
royalties on gold produced was described as 'unrealistic' by one
representative.
China, which has emerged as the world's largest gold consumer, has
previously banned foreign involvement in the exploration and exploitation of
its gold reserves; but now is anxious to tap foreign expertise and capital.
Vice minister Zhang Wenju told the conference that China had decided that
exploitation of its minerals resources should be speeded up to keep pace
with the country's high-speed economic growth, which was nearly 13 per cent
last year and is expected to exceed 10 per cent this year.
Under the draft law, foreigners could explore either on their own or in
partnership with Chinese organisations.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Colombia tries to shore up
sagging coffee market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COLOMBIA, THE world's second biggest coffee producer, yesterday tried to put
a floor under the world's sagging coffee prices.
But many analysts were sceptical that the attempt was strong enough to have
much effect. After opening more than 1.5 cents higher, the New York nearby
arabica contract fell back to 58.80 cents a lb in late trading, just 0.40
ahead. In London, the July robusta contract tested the Dollars 900 barrier
again, but closed at Dollars 881, a rise of just Dollars 6 on the day.
The markets had expected something from Colombia but appeared to be
disappointed at the action taken. The country has set an effective floor of
60 cents a lb, below which it will not sell coffee.
'We were expecting them to say they would not sell unless the price went
up,' said one analyst yesterday. 'Instead they have said they will not sell
if the price falls further. It's an anti-climax.'
London traders said the market had not even moved above its recent narrow
trading range. 'Colombia doing something on a unilateral basis does not
preclude other countries selling into any rally,' one pointed out.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures broker, said the
Colombians had very little coffee left to shift, demand was low in the
run-up to the northern summer and western consumer stocks were high. 'If
they had done this last November it might have been a different story.'
ED&amp; F. Man, the London broker, this week pointed out that Colombian exports
in the last two months had fallen to 1.2m bags (60 kgs each) compared with
an average 1.5m bags in the first five months of 1992-93. Man also put world
consumer stocks at 20.5m bags - a level equal to the previous peak last
September.
Mr Eagles believed high stocks and an expected increase in Brazil's crop
would be enough to push the nearby New York contract back below 50 cents
this summer. Last year the market hit a low of 48.10 cents a lb in August.

COPPER built on another solid performance at the LME, ending firmer. On
chart grounds, the rally should at least be maintained up to Dollars
1,910-Dollars 1,920 a tonne, dealers said. There is little fundamental
justification for much further on the upside, although dips are likely to
find increased buying interest. London COCOA staged a key upside reversal
boosted by the weakness of sterling and some speculative buying in New York.
However, dealers noted that some origin selling interest appeared to be
emerging, with Ghana said to be hovering around the market. Chicago
SOYABEANS resumed Wednesday's weak posture as funds and speculators
continued to liquidate long positions, traders said. A large grain firm
estimated soyabean acreage would increase to 60m acres, 600,000 acres higher
than the USDA's estimate, as rains were hampering maize plantings. New York
frozen concentrated ORANGE JUICE futures were down in early trading after
three straight sessions of gains amid speculation of a smaller Brazil crop.
Brazil reduced its estimate for the 1993-94 orange crop to 282m boxes from a
preliminary estimate of 292.8m boxes.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: Spanish prices soar on devaluation move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS that the peseta would be devalued sent the Spanish government bond
market rocketing up yesterday in anticipation of interest rate cuts.
The actual devaluation figures  - 8 per cent for the peseta and 6.5 per cent
for the Portuguese escudo  - came out after the European markets closed.
Spanish bonds gained two points or more, with the shorter end feeling the
most benefit. Demand came from new investors and some switching out of
German bunds.
Although the devaluation was in the range of forecasts, it was significantly
ahead of the lower estimates of 6 per cent, adding to the feeling that there
would be further gains today.
At the longer end of the market, political uncertainty ahead of the general
election on June 6 was cited as one factor limiting the upside. Another was
the rise in inflation  - disappointing figures announced yesterday were not
quite drowned out by the peseta furore.
While Portuguese government bonds also registered gains, the illiquidity of
the market deterred investors.
The French government bond market was a little surprised at the swiftness of
the Bank of France's latest  1/4 point cuts in key interest rates but the
response was muted by continued nervousness ahead of the Danish referendum.
In Germany, two factors dampened the bond market after yesterday's rally on
the repo rate cut. One was the switching into Spain, the other some head
shaking by Bundesbank leaders over the prospect of accelerating rate cuts
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, central bank president, stressed the need the
maintain D-Mark stability. Hesaid 'a sledgehammer interest rate policy' was
inappropriate andearly gains in bunds were lost.
The day ended weakly for the UK market, which today expects the Bank of
England to make an announcement about the next gilt auction.
The 10-15 year area is forecast to be the target and roughly Pounds 3bn is
anticipated to keep up the relentless funding programme. The recent
faltering of the pound was seen as limiting overseas interest.
Reports of the death of Japan's benchmark government bond, the No 145 due
2002, seem to have been exaggerated. A revival of interest brought its yield
back below 4.5 per cent. It opened at 4.55 per cent and closed at 4.485 in
Tokyo. However, in overseas trading its fortunes waned again as it followed
US Treasuriesdownwards.
MORE BAD news on inflation sent longer-dated US Treasury securities into a
tailspin. The benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1 3/16 at 102 7/32
, yielding 6.946 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note
was down  5/32 at 99 31/32 , to yield 3.874 per cent.
The news that sparked the sell-off at the long end was a
bigger-than-expected 0.4 per cent jump in the April consumer prices index
which, taken with Wednesday's news of an unexpected rise in the producer
prices index, reignited investors' fears of inflation. The 'core' measure of
consumer price inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, was
also strong, at up 0.4 per cent. Adding to market woes was news of April
retail sales up 1.2 per cent.
The decline in the long bond was exacerbated by concerns that the bad
inflation numbers would ruin the afternoon auction of Dollars 8.25bn in
30-year bonds. Although the auction subsequently went off smoothly, it was
not enough to pull the market off the bottom, which may also have been
disturbed by news of another strong set of weekly auto sales.

FT  14 MAY 93 / International Bonds: Sweden launches aggressively-priced
Dollars 1.5bn FRN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE KINGDOM of Sweden provided the talking point of the Eurobond market
yesterday with the launch of an aggressively-priced Dollars 1.5bn
floating-rate note.
Dealers were quick to point out that the market is badly in need of a liquid
FRN issue, adding that Sweden's deal helps to create a new benchmark note in
the five-year area. 'The concept is right - there is a technical shortage of
liquid sovereign paper,' said one syndicate head.
However, the deal's pricing - at 99.70 to give a yield of 6.4 basis points
over Libor - was seen as being very tight. Participating banks admitted that
the deal was going slowly, and one banker estimated that no more than a
third of the bonds had been placed. 'The pricing is tight, but not
outrageous - it is going to be a slow slog but it will get done,' was one US
banker's verdict.
Another syndicate head said he had hoped to see a yield of at least 10 basis
points over Libor, which he felt would have helped the deal to go more
quickly. However, UBS, the joint lead manager, justified the pricing by
citing other sovereign FRNs, many of which are trading through (rather than
over) Libor. Belgium (AA1) has two FRNs trading at 3 - 4 basis points below
Libor, but Ireland (AA3/AA - ) has an FRN trading at 8 basis points over
Libor. Sweden itself has a credit rating of AA2/AA+.
The lead managers expect traditional FRN investors - such as central banks,
money market funds and bond funds - to buy the issue, which is due to break
syndicate today.
Land Securities launched a Pounds 150m convertible bond due 2008 on the back
of strong resultsbut dealers said firm demand from continental European
investors was inspired as much by the 7 per cent coupon as the deal's equity
component.
The conversion price was set at 640p, a premium of 15.94 per cent, about the
same level as for other recent sterling convertible issues. Strong demand
from continental Europe has allowed UK companies to set higher premiums on
recent convertible offerings than would be acceptable solely with a UK
investor base.
'European investors came back into the market because they are bullish on
sterling, now it is out of the ERM and they like the high coupon with an
equity kicker,' said one trader.
The deal, arranged by J. Henry Schroder Wagg, was quoted at 100 3/8 , above
its reoffer price of 100. It is callable after five years.
Elsewhere, the Eurobond market saw activity in a range of currencies.
Australian Broadcasting Corporation made its debut with an ADollars 100m,
five-year issue. The borrower is state-owned and has a triple-A rating.
The bonds were priced to yield 10 basis points over the relevant government
bond at full fees. It was offered at 7 basis points above, and traded at 5
basis points over by late afternoon. Hambros Bank, the lead manager, said
the bonds were bought by 'a good spread of investors' in Germany and
Benelux.
In the dollar sector, General Electric Capital Corporation launched a
Dollars 200m three-year deal via Merrill Lynch aimed mainly at European
retail investors.

FT  14 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Nokia to place preference
shares abroad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NOKIA, the Finnish electronics group, is planning to raise Dollars 100m in
new capital through a placement of preference shares with international
investors.
The group said the funds would be used to strengthen its balance sheet and
help it finance the rapid growth of its telecommunications and cellular
phone businesses.
This is the first international issue to be made by a leading Finnish
company for several years and reflects a growing sense of confidence among
the country's main exporters following the sharp depreciation of the markka.
The issue is being made amid strong interest in Nokia's preferred shares,
which have risen from FM82 to FM152 this year. It also comes as the group's
core telecommunications and mobile phones businesses are performing
strongly.
Last year telecommunications increased sales by 73 per cent to FM3.21bn and
mobile phones by 45 per cent to FM3.64bn as the group cut pre-tax losses to
FM158m from FM324m.
Mr Olli-Pekka Kalasvuo, Nokia's chief financial officer, said a new issue,
priced in line with Nokia's current share price, would lead to a 6-7 per
cent dilution.
Shareholder approval for the issue will be sought at an extraordinary
general meeting on June 10. Credit Suisse First Boston and Enskilda
Securities are acting as advisers.
Around 20 per cent of Nokia's shares are in international hands, following
the relaxation of restrictions on foreign share ownership at the start of
this year.

FT  14 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Moody's downgrades two
Skandia offshoots

MOODY'S Investors Service yesterday downgraded the short-term ratings of two
units of Skandia, the Swedish insurer, due to concerns about the group's
asset quality and financial flexibility.
The agency lowered its ratings on the Eurocommercial paper programmes of
Skandia Capital AB and Skandia International Capital Corp to Prime-3 from
Prime-2, affecting programme totals of Dollars 600m and Dollars 200m
respectively.
Moody's said 'substantial leverage' was needed to support Skandia's finance
operations and investments in subsidiaries and real estate, but warned that
its ability to generate capital through retained earnings would remain under
pressure 'given the likelihood of additional deterioration in the value of
its real estate holdings in Stockholm, London and Madrid'.
However, it was positive about the group's proposed restructuring and said
its position should have been improved by rising Swedish share prices.
Nikki Tait in New York adds: Centre Reinsurance Companies, which is
majority-owned by Zurich Insurance Group, is to take over the 'finite'
reinsurance business of Skandia America Reinsurance Corp, part of the
Skandia group.
Under the agreement, New York-based Centre Re will reinsure the portfolio
and take financial responsibility for the business. The Swedish-owned
company said this would allow it to focus on traditional property-casualty
insurance.
SARC has assets of more than Dollars 1.4bn and a surplus in excess of
Dollars 293m. Centre Re, which also counts Kemper Securities and
Northwestern Mutual Life Company among its shareholders, had assets of
Dollars 49bn at end-1991 and a surplus of Dollars 4.9bn.

IFIL, the listed holding company controlled by Italy's Agnelli family,
raised net group profits by 18.6 per cent to L192.8bn (Dollars 130m) last
year from L162.5bn in 1991, writes Haig Simonian in Milan.
Ifil said it spent about L230bn to take its stake in Saint Louis, the French
industrial holding company controlled by the Worms group, to 15.6 per cent
from 6.5 per cent. Ifil said its aim, in agreement with Worms, was to
increase its stake to a similar level to the 31.8 per cent held by Worms.
Net earnings for the parent company climbed by 13.6 per cent to L119.8bn,
prompting a L10 a share dividend rise to L140 for ordinary shares and to
L160 for savings stock. The value of Ifil's holdings, centred on the Fiat
cars group, Saint Louis, the BSN foods group and Accor, the French hotels
chain, rose to L2,025bn last year from L1,805bn at the end of 1991. The
holdings showed a capital gain of over L900bn.

FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: A glimpse behind the veil around
the Hinduja empire - Stefan Wagstyl interviews the group's chairman and
family head, Mr Srichand Hinduja
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MORE than 50 years, an aura of secrecy has surrounded the businesses of
the Hinduja family, owners of an international trading empire.
With luxury homes in London and elsewhere, lavish parties and generous
charitable donations, the Hindujas have enjoyed the trappings of wealth.
They have been photographed with celebrities ranging from Lady Thatcher and
Mr George Bush to Mrs Indira Gandhi. They make gifts to Cambridge and
Harvard Universities and to Indian hospitals. But, until now, they have said
little publicly about the enterprises from which they make their money.
Last month, the Hindujas said they wanted to talk more openly about their
businesses, because they planned to engage more in public commercial
activities - such as running listed companies, tapping the capital markets,
and, possibly, launching a bank. They have already invested in
publicly-quoted companies in India, and may consider similar moves in other
countries, including the UK and the US.
Mr Srichand Hinduja, the group chairman and head of the family, told the FT:
'If we give away how we trade, we give away secrets . . . We don't talk
about our business so people have this (sense of) confusion.' But the group
now felt it should give out more facts.
Sitting in a villa in Delhi with silk carpets at his feet, Mr Hinduja talked
freely about world politics, the global economy and the value of Indian
scientific traditions.
Mr Hinduja gave glimpses of a group which employs 16,000 people, mainly in
India, Iran, the Gulf states, Switzerland, the UK and US. He described
activities ranging from fund management and project finance to trading
potatoes. He declined to give figures for revenues, profits or assets,
though he did not dispute estimates which put the family's wealth at above
Pounds 1bn (Dollars 1.54bn). Mr Hinduja puts down to political
vindictiveness accusations against a family member in India's Bofors
scandal, in which the Swedish arms maker was alleged to have paid bribes to
secure a gun contract.
The family comes from Sind, the fertile coastal province in present-day
Pakistan, which is an ancestral home for many Indian merchant families. The
Hindujas are devout Hindus, vegetarians, teetotallers and non-smokers, who
have made their fortunes primarily in the Moslem world.
Mr Srichand Hinduja's father moved from Sind to Bombay in 1914 and started
trading textiles, dried fruits and other goods with Persia. The family later
migrated to Tehran and stayed until just before the fall of the Shah in
1979.
In Iran, the family traded goods such as fertilisers, cement, oil, metals
and textiles. They made contact with the Shah's family and profited greatly
when the 1974 oil shock pushed up oil prices and launched the Shah on a huge
import buying spree.
The Hindujas invested in electricity transmission towers, property and
investment banking. They made money from films - buying the Iranian rights
to Indian films and dubbing them in Farsi. This venture was so successful
that they later named one of their trading companies Sangam after a
top-selling romantic drama.
After leaving Iran, Mr Srichand Hinduja and his three brothers - Gopichand,
Prakash and Ashok - spread across the world to build a global trading
network and to diversify their political connections. Mr Srichand Hinduja,
now 58, moved to London, where he oversees the group from his main office in
New Zealand House, in Haymarket. Mr Gopichand Hinduja, aged 53, also lives
in London and is responsible for project finance and trade, including the
group's continuing business with Iran, which survived the family's departure
from Tehran.
The third brother, 48-year-old Mr Prakash Hinduja, lives in Geneva, home of
the group's financial services business. The fourth, 43-year-old Mr Ashok
Hinduja, lives in Bombay, where he runs the group's fast-growing Indian
operations.
Of the group's 16,000 staff, some 2,000 work outside India. The main trading
companies are Sangam in London, Alcari in Switzerland and France, HBI in the
US, and Beromat in Germany.
The group's most visible operation is Gulf Oil Trading, an oil trader and
manufacturer of lubricants, which the Hindujas bought in 1984 from Chevron
of the US. In 1990, the lubricants business was transferred into a joint
venture with OMV, the state-owned Austrian oil company. The Hindujas
retained full ownership of the trading operations.
Financial services are organised in Amas, a Swiss-registered company, which
manages funds, says Mr Hinduja, 'for high net-worth clients mostly from the
oriental world'. Amas has joint ventures with Credit Anstalt of Austria,
Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, and a fund management subsidiary of
Jardine Matheson, the British-owned trading company. It also has a
co-operation agreement with Morgan Stanley, the New York investment bank.
In India, the Hindujas' biggest single investment is a controlling stake in
Ashok Leyland, a leading bus and truck maker, which the family bought in
partnership with Iveco, a Fiat subsidiary, in 1987 for about Pounds 30m. The
partners are now investing about Rs15bn (Dollars 476.2m) in modernisation.
Hinduja companies are also involved in a Rs30bn scheme to build a thermal
power station in central India; plans for a Rs33bn oil refinery; and a joint
bid with Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications company, for cellular
telephone services.
But these last three projects have still to materialise. Mr Srichand Hinduja
says the group has delayed its investments in India because it disliked
operating in the heavily-regulated economy which preceded recent
liberalisation.
Mr Hinduja welcomes the widespread economic reforms started by the late
Rajiv Gandhi and prime minister PV Narasimha Rao. He says he is 'very
optimistic' about India's economic future. The country has manufacturers of
'world-class standard' and 150m-200m people capable of buying 'world-class
goods'. Mr Hinduja is not put off by the inter-religious unrest which
followed the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque. Similar conflicts exist
elsewhere, he says. In India such tensions tend to cool down.
The cloud of the long-running Bofors scandal still hangs over the Hinduja
family in India, as it does over others in business and politics. The affair
broke in 1987 when allegations emerged that the Bofors company had paid
bribes to secure a SKr8.4bn (Dollars 1.13bn) howitzer order. Suspicions were
raised that the beneficiaries might have included Mr Rajiv Gandhi.
India's Central Bureau of Investigation, which is probing the affair, has
not found any evidence implicating the late prime minister. But, in a
prosecution report filed in 1990, the CBI named 14 people and companies in a
case of alleged corruption. Among the accused is Mr Gopichand Hinduja. In
pursuit of its case, the CBI is requesting details of bank accounts from the
Swiss authorities. Mr Srichand Hinduja's name appears in a court list of
people seeking to block the release of the Swiss documents to India. The
Federal Court, Switzerland's top court, is due to decide the matter later
this year.
Mr Srichand Hinduja says the family 'had nothing to do with the sale of the
Bofors guns', and that the allegations stem from the 'vindictiveness' of his
political enemies. He insists that neither in India, nor in Iran nor
anywhere else has the family dealt in arms.
The Hindujas feel accusations of involvement in nefarious deals stem from
ignorance of their trading skills. 'The secret is that we have diversified
in-house strengths,' says Mr Srichand Hinduja. Overheads are kept low. The
group does not borrow. Transactions are kept secret until they are complete
for reasons of competition but, once finished, the information becomes known
in the trading community. 'We operate in many fields and can match our
knowledge of transactions with our knowledge of countries,' he says.

FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Japanese banks put off facing up
to bad loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE banks will avoid confronting their bad loan problems in accounts to
be released for the year ended March, in spite of a Bank of Japan
recommendation that they should be more open about their loan losses.
Leading banks are still determined to give the impression that each
institution's bad loan burden is much the same, and even the trust banks,
particularly hard hit by bad property loans, plan to report net profits for
the year to March.
The seven trust banks are expected to report, on average, a halving of net
profits. The most vulnerable, Nippon Trust Bank, will announce a net profit
of around Y2bn (Dollars 17.9m), compared to Y2.3bn in the previous period,
banking sources said.
Sanwa Bank and Mitsubishi Bank are expected to report net profits of more
than Y60bn, down from Y102bn previously and Y84bn in 1990-91. Sumitomo Bank
is likely to have a net profit of Y14bn, compared to Y109.8bn, after having
written off Y100bn of exposure to Itoman, the dissolved trading house and
speculator.
The trust banks said yesterday they would be able to cover stock appraisal
losses with increased business profits. But some banks would almost
certainly be forced to report a loss without a favourable change in
accounting regulations allowed late last year by the ministry of finance.
In previous years, trust banks have only been allowed to report interest
already received on loans from their trust account, but this year, they can
report delayed payments from troubled clients as interest earned, as long as
the payment is not more than six months overdue.
Ms Alicia Ogawa, of Salomon Brothers, estimates that 40 per cent of the
banks' trust account loans were made to property and financial companies,
many of which have been badly bruised by stock and property market
collapses.
Ms Ogawa said: 'It is clear that Japanese banks, unlike American banks, are
going to take a long-term approach to dealing with their problems. It is
very difficult to tell one bank from another because you can't really see
how exposed they are.'
Officially, the leading 21 Japanese banks had Y12,300bn in property-related
non-performing loans at the end of September, and an estimated Y14,000bn to
Y15,000bn at the end of March.
However, the banks' actual exposure is unofficially estimated at Y30,000bn,
as the official figure does not include affiliates' problem loans or the
impact of interest rate cuts, sometimes to zero, for troubled clients.

fiscal year ending June 30 1994, AP reports from Canberra.
'There has been considerable progress this financial year,' he said.
'Although Qantas will not be fully sold this financial year the sale will be
completed in the next financial year,' Mr Willis told parliament in response
to a question about the progress of the sale.

Toyoda Automatic Loom Works, one of the Toyota Motor group of companies, saw
profits rise for the fiscal year ended March.
Pre-tax profits grew by 1 per cent to Y24.3bn, due to streamlining efforts,
compared to a 20.3 per cent decline a year ago, writes Wayne Aponte. Net
profits rose 2.2 per cent to Y15.3bn.
But overall sales dropped 2 per cent to Y571.5bn in the softening domestic
motor market.
The company assembles cars for Toyota, and makes textile machinery,
industrial vehicles and engines.
Toyoda Automatic Loom forecasts a below-average performance this fiscal year
due to foreign exchange losses and increased depreciation costs. Sales are
expected to drop about 3.8 per cent to Y550bn, with pre-tax profits down
13.6 per cent to Y21bn and net profits down 12.9 per cent.
Sales of Toyoda Machine Works declined 7.3 per cent last year to Y161.8bn

MITSUBISHI Estate, Japan's leading property company, suffered a double-digit
decline in pre-tax profits for the fiscal year to March. Taxable profits
dropped 21.7 per cent to Y70.6bn (Dollars 634m) from a year earlier because
of a prolonged downturn in the domestic property market. Net profits fell
22.7 per cent to Y37bn, while sales grew a slim 1 per cent to Y349bn.
The company owns land and office buildings in Tokyo's financial district.
According to housing sector analysts, the economic downturn lowered
Mitsubishi Estate's occupancy rates for large-scale office buildings to
about 60 per cent, compared with 90 per cent in previous years. In addition,
leasing rates are seen declining for its new buildings.
Mitsubishi Estates shares, which have retreated from a 1993 peak of Y1,290,
ended Y20 lower at Y1,140 in Tokyo yesterday.

FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: S African blacks offered stake
in Metropolitan Life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
METROPOLITAN LIFE, South Africa's seventh largest life insurer, is to invite
the country's black community to take a stake in the company.
More than 90 per cent of Metpol's new business is sold to blacks and 84 per
cent of existing policyholders are black.
Under the R137m (Dollars 43m) deal, a new company, Metlife Investment
Holdings (Methold), to be controlled by black shareholders, will buy from
Sankorp, the company which manages the strategic investments of the Sanlam
group, 10 per cent of the equity of Metpol.
Methold will also have a five-year option to buy a further 20 per cent of
Metpol's equity, less one share, from Sankorp.
The transaction is the most far-reaching yet taken with the aim of
increasing the role of blacks in an economy that remains overwhelmingly
dominated by whites.
Giving more economic power to blacks will be a priority of any future
government in South Africa.
Significant, too, is that Sankorp is behind the deal. Sankorp played a
decisive role in promoting the unbundling of Gencor, South Africa's second
largest mining house, announced earlier this week. Unbundling and black
economic empowerment are both key aims of the African National Congress,
which will be the dominant partner in a future government. Taken together,
the two initiatives cast Sankorp in a politically progressive light.
Explaining the deal yesterday, Mr Marinus Daling, chief executive of
Sankorp, said: 'It is imperative that a larger part of the South African
population be given the opportunity to participate meaningfully in the
economy.'
It was Sankorp's aim, with the Metpol transaction, 'to make a positive
contribution towards the important structural changes that are required in
the South Africa economy'. He added that there were considerable other
benefits, especially marketing, which should make the deal a financial
success for Metpol.
The transaction makes Metpol the first quoted company in which the black
community plays a dominant role.
It is being financed by the Industrial Development Corporation, which will
be repaid as money is generated through the sale of Methold shares to the
black community.
The 40 per cent of Metpol shares held between Sankorp and Methold is the
basis for a voting pool agreement between these two parties where the
'leading role' will rest with Methold.
The underlying principles of the agreement are that Metpol will retain its
listing, policyholders' interests will not be prejudiced and existing
management will not be disrupted. Metpol has a market capitalisation of
about R1.6bn and total assets just short of R5bn.

HYUNDAI MOTOR, South Korea's largest vehicle maker, yesterday resumed normal
operations after production was disrupted by a two-week strike at its main
subcontractor for bumpers, writes John Burton in Seoul.
Hyundai said that it lost almost Dollars 200m in sales due to delays in the
production of 20,000 cars as a result of the industrial action at Apollo
Industrial, which also supplies headlamps and crash pads.
The government last week ordered a police raid against Apollo to arrest the
trade union leaders that were leading the illegal strike. The union this
week agreed to end the strike if its leaders were released.

COST CUTTING and aggressive marketing in new business sectors helped Citizen
Watch to a slight rise in pre-tax profits for the year to end-March in spite
of sluggish domestic demand and depressed international markets.
Citizen reported a 0.3 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Y16.9bn
(Dollars 152.3m) on a 6.9 per cent rise in sales to Y252.4bn.
The company said it had faced a harsh environment with cuts in corporate
capital investment in Japan, which affected Citizen's industrial machinery
business, along with sluggish personal consumption and stagnant overseas
markets. Citizen warned that the recent rapid appreciation of the yen and
the prospect of growing frictions with its trade partners cast a shadow over
the outlook for the coming year.
Wrist watch production rose by 14.9 per cent to 186.7m watches. However,
intensifying price competition for luxury watches reduced Citizen's profit
margins, offsetting gains on sales of cheaper products, including those made
under licence to other companies.
Worldwide wristwatch sales fell by 2.5 per cent to Y119.4bn. Citizen said it
was mainly cutting costs by transferring wristwatch production to lower cost
sites elsewhere in Asia.
The sharp fall in Japanese corporate investment cut sales of industrial
machinery by 35 per cent to Y17.1bn. However, sales of notebook personal
computers were strengthened by Citizen's strong position in miniaturisation
technology. This pushed up sales of information equipment and parts by 38.6
per cent to Y74.5bn.
Sales of liquid crystal display units and portable televisions grew, taking
the company's sales of electronic equipment to Y35.5bn, up 30.2 per cent
from the year before.
Sales of electronic and information equipment made up 43 per cent of
Citizen's sales last year, compared to 33 per cent in the previous year.
Net income per share was 14.9 per cent up at Y30.65. The final dividend was
increased by Y1 to Y5, lifting the full dividend to from Y8 to Y9.

earnings

<TEXT>
DIFFICULT market conditions depressed attributable earnings of Anglo
American Coal (Amcoal), South Africa's largest coal group, by 6.4 per cent,
before extraordinary items, to R252.3m (Dollars 79.3m) from R269.4m in the
year to March, writes Philip Gawith.
Mr David Rankin, chairman, also forecast lower earnings in the year ahead,
saying a better domestic performance would be offset by a significantly
reduced contribution from exports. He said export prices appeared to be
approaching levels which would call into question the viability of some of
South Africa's exporting collieries.

FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Taiwan revives its privatisation
programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Taiwanese government is to revive its scarred privatisation programme by
offering majority stakes in two state companies in the next fortnight.
Shares will be auctioned to avoid the problems that beset recent
privatisations of China Steel and BES Engineering.
The TDollars 108bn (USDollars 4.13bn) domestic tranche of last year's China
Steel share offer was only 38 per cent subscribed. The attempted TDollars
6.1bn sale of 60 per cent of BES in December fared worse, forcing the
government to arrange this second attempt at selling the shares.
However, Taiwan Machinery may be an even greater test. The industrial
company has been a substantial loss-maker in recent years, but it has
100,000 sq metres of prime vacant land, and the government is expecting some
interest from property developers.
The ministry of economic affairs plans to offer 385m shares, or 60 per cent,
of Taiwan Machinery, raising in the region of TDollars 10bn. A base price
will be set, and investors will put in offers for a minimum 10 per cent
stake at, or above, that price.
The ministry claims the primary incentive for its privatisations is to
achieve greater autonomy for the company, thereby improving management
efficiency. But so far it has failed to sell a controlling stake in any of
its public companies.
A more fundamental rationale for the government's privatisation programme is
to alleviate the huge debt burden created by its proposed USDollars 300bn
six-year development plan.
Brokers remain cynical about whether these privatisations can be successful.
There is no co-ordination between the various ministries that control
Taiwan's public enterprises, and there is an archaic public share offering
system.
Under the current mechanism, a company has to fix the issue price more than
one month before investors have to pay up for its stock; usually, if the
stock market falls, the issue is not subscribed, as was the fate for both
China Steel and BES.
Taiwan Machinery and BES will be the first share offers to take place by
auction, and the ministry has looked at a number of other ways of
streamlining the issue process.
It has a strong incentive to do so. It is due to offer a tranche of China
Petrochemical during 1992. The finance ministry is also scheduled to raise
more than TDollars 50bn this year through the privatisations of Chiao Tung
Bank, Farmers Bank and Chung Kuo Insurance.

FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Ford chief concerned at economic
uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our New York staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US economy remains 'one of the most daunting concerns' for Ford,
according to Mr Harold Poling, chairman of the US carmaker, writes our New
York staff.
Mr Poling told the annual meeting in Dearborn, Michigan, yesterday that
although the economy had improved, the improvement had been slower and more
modest than in previous recoveries.
'Consistent with that, we're forecasting industry sales in the US of about
13.7m units for 1993, up from 13.1m in 1992, or less than 5 per cent,' he
said.
The pace of the US recovery was being held back by uncertainty over likely
tax increases and President Bill Clinton's healthcare reform package. Until
that uncertainty was removed, consumer confidence would not be great enough
to cause a strong increase in sales, Mr Poling said.
'We're grappling with difficult economies in the rest of the world as well
 -particularly Europe  - along with intense competition and excess capacity,
all of which make achieving satisfactory results a much more formidable
task,' he said.
Last month Ford reported first-quarter earnings more than doubled at Dollars
572m, reflecting improved results from its North American vehicle operations
and a strong performance by its financial services business. These results,
Mr Poling said, were reason for optimism.

BRITISH Columbia has a launched a wide-ranging investigation into the
Vancouver stock exchange in an attempt to avoid further repetitions of the
scandals which have plagued the exchange.
The investigation will be conducted by Mr Jim Matkin, former president of
the Business Council of British Columbia. Mr Matkin has been asked to report
within six months.
His terms of reference include the powers and responsibilities of regulatory
bodies, including the VSE, as well as the adequacy of penalties for
wrongdoing. He has also been asked to make proposals on the allocation of
resources for prosecutions.
Numerous measures have been taken in recent years to tighten listings
procedures and other rules, but the VSE's image has remained tarnished.
Despite its problems, however, the VSE index has soared by 47 per cent this
year.

MR Richard Breeden, former chairman of the US Securities and Exchange

Coopers &amp; Lybrand as a senior partner.
The firm said yesterday that Mr Breeden, who served as SEC chairman from
1989 until last month, will help run Coopers' US and international financial
services groups.
Mr Breeden, 43, will lead the firm's efforts in providing advice to clients
on capital markets and regulation, and in the privatisation of foreign
companies, a business which Coopers has pioneered.
The appointment is a coup for Coopers, which will be able to exploit Mr
Breeden's political clout, his understanding of international regulatory
issues and his experience of the global securities business.

FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: The Gap slides 8% to Dollars
41.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GAP, the fashion store group which until last summer was one of the
brightest retail 'stars' in the US, yesterday reported an 8 per cent fall in
first-quarter profits, to Dollars 41.5m after tax.
The profits slip came on sales of Dollars 643.6m for the three months to May
1, up from Dollars 588.9m in the same three months of 1992.
However, The Gap said that on a same-store basis, turnover showed a 1 per
cent decline.
The apparent increase was generated by the addition of new stores: at the
end of the period, the company had 1,319 outlets, comprising 880 Gap, 166
Banana Republic and 273 GapKids, against 1,236 a year earlier.
In spite of the slide in profits, Mr Donald Fisher, chairman, said the
company was pleased with the progress 'in the light of continued weak
consumer demand'.
He added that the group had been operating with lower stock levels, and had
succeeded in being less promotional. As a result, it had seen 'improved
merchandise margins'.
On Wall Street, Gap shares closed down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 35 1/2 . The
retailer's stock has suffered over the past year because of investors'
worries about competitive pressures for core items, such as jeans and
T-shirts, but has regained some ground over the past two months.

FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Catalogue of controversy at
annual meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEARS, Roebuck managed to avoid confrontation with Ms Elizabeth Holtzman,
New York City's comptroller, at its annual meeting in Kansas, but still
found itself swamped by controversy, writes Laurie Morse.
Dozens of smaller shareholders, many of them retired Sears employees,
complained that, by dumping its century-old catalogue and closing small-town
stores, the company had abandoned rural America. A bus-load of protesters
from Chicago and other mid-western cities disrupted the meeting with demands
that Allstate, Sears' insurance arm, address allegations of 'red-lining'  -
denying or overcharging for insurance in poor communities.
The charge against Allstate, by the activist group Association of Community
Organisations for Reform Now, forced Sears directors to make a hasty exit
from the meeting, protected by local police.
The public protest came less than a month before Sears plans to take 20 per
cent of Allstate stock public. The stock is being offered at a price close
to Dollars 27 per share.
Sears' largest activist shareholders were absent from the meeting, however,
apparently mollified by a steady rise in the company's stock price this
year. Sears closed Thursday up Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 55 1/4 , up from
Dollars 41 in September, when the company's restructuring was announced.
Ms Holtzman, who represents more than 2m Sears shares through her
administration of New York's employee pension funds, decided not to travel
to Kansas when it became clear that her initiative to force Mr Edward
Brennan to divest of one of his two management titles would fail to win
majority support.
Three shareholder initiatives, all aimed at reform of the governing board
and management, received substantial support but failed to win a majority.
Ms Holtzman's proposal, delivered by proxy, received 35 per cent of the
vote. A plan seeking annual elections for all directors won 44 per cent of
the vote.

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES at Thomson Corp-oration, the Canadian-owned travel and information
group, widened in the first quarter, largely because of weak demand and
higher spending on new North American publishing products.
The company disclosed it had sold all but one of more than 70 loss-making UK
free sheets. The loss on these sales was covered in a special charge against
1992 earnings.
The first-quarter loss was USDollars 55m, or 10 cents a share, up from
Dollars 47m, or 9 cents, a year earlier. Revenues dipped to Dollars 1.07bn
from Dollars 1.14bn.
The first quarter is normally the weakest for the travel group and
substantial parts of the publishing business. Thomson said seasonal losses
had grown as its interests in these areas expanded, but higher winter losses
should be offset by improved summer profits.
The information and publishing division suffered an operating loss of
Dollars 19m, after amortisation of publishing rights and circulation, up
from Dollars 3m last year. But UK regional newspapers achieved 'improved'
results.
Thomson Travel's operating loss narrowed to Dollars 29m from Dollars 34m,
due to the stronger US dollar against sterling and profits from aircraft
disposals.
The company said summer 1993 holidays were selling well after a slow start,
with sales volumes 8 per cent ahead of this time last year. But Britannia
Airways' business was slower in the first quarter than a year ago.
Profits and margins of North American newspapers improved, due largely to
cost cutting. But trading conditions remain difficult, with advertising
lineage down 5.1 per cent and circulation of many titles under pressure. Mr
Michael Johnston, head of Thomson Newspapers, resigned earlier this week
after a disagreement with senior management.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treuhand, the agency responsible for privatising eastern German
industry, yesterday concluded the sale of the region's potash mines in a
contract giving it a 49 per cent stake in the new company.
The contract will involve the Treuhand in a DM1bn (Dollars 620m) investment.
However, the Treuhand will have an opt-out clause giving it the right to
sell its stake after five years. The ministry of finance will decide in two
weeks whether to validate the unusual sale.
The contract involves selling Mitteldeutsche Kali to Kali &amp; Salz, which is
75 per cent owned by BASF, the German chemicals group.
Kali &amp; Salz will hold 51 per cent in the new company, which will work
towards reducing capacity and cutting the labour force in mines in eastern
and western Germany.
Kali &amp; Salz lost more than DM10m in 1991 on sales of DM1.4bn, while its
eastern German counterpart recorded a loss of more than DM100m, on sales of
less than DM1bn.
The contract preserves Germany's monopoly over the potash industry in
Europe, in spite of attempts to seek a foreign partner.
However, the new company will reduce total potash capacity to about 3.1m
tonnes a year in the whole of Germany, and cut the combined workforce from
11,000 to 7,000.

<TEXT>
INTEL has filed a complaint with the US International Trade Commission
against a Taiwanese personal computer manufacturer in a move to try to block
imports of computers that contain 'clones' of its microprocessor chips.
The action is the latest in a Intel's campaign of litigation against
Advanced Micro Devices and Cyrix, two US chip companies that produce their
own versions of Intel's top-selling chips.
The ITC complaint alleges that Twinhead, a Taiwanese maker of notebook
computers, is selling products in the US that infringe an Intel patent.
Intel has related patent infringement cases pending in US courts against
both AMD and Cyrix.
The trade action against a competitors' customer follows a decision in the
Cyrix patent case, in which the court refused to grant Cyrix an injunction
preventing Intel from filing a suit against Cyrix customers. AMD said it
believed its customers were protected from infringing Intel patents by a
cross-licensing agreement between the two companies. That agreement is,
however, the subject of separate litigation.

THE Midwest stock exchange, the second-largest stock exchange in the US
after New York, will return to its original name, the Chicago Stock
Exchange, from July 8.
Members voted for the change in the hope that the Chicago name would carry a
higher profile than 'Midwest'.
The 111-year-old stock exchange took the Midwest name in 1949 when it
acquired stock exchanges in Cleveland, St Louis, Minneapolis and, later, New
Orleans.
'We operate in a very competitive environment and want to build the identity
of our exchange locally, nationally and internationally,' said Mr Homer
Livingston, exchange president.
'We believe the name 'Chicago' is key to strengthening that identity, given
the Chicago exchange's reputation for creative products, innovative
technology and focus on service.'

GAMBRO, the Swedish medical equipment maker, increased first-quarter profits
to SKr220m (Dollars 29.7m) from SKr176m as sales rose 42 per cent to
SKr2.1bn, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. It expects full-year
profit to exceed last year's SKr753m. Profit per share rose to SKr4.61 from
SKr3.72. The group said the full-year result would benefit from the weaker
krona.

FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Fininvest unveils SBE float
details
</HEADLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FININVEST, the Italian media and financial services group controlled by Mr
Silvio Berlusconi, yesterday unveiled its long-awaited plan to list its
Silvio Berlusconi Editore publishing subsidiary.
The flotation of SBE is linked to an offer to shareholders in Mondadori,
Italy's biggest publishing group, to swap into SBE. The aim is to retain
Mondadori's identity while having SBE as the eventual single quoted vehicle
for Fininvest's publishing interests.
Analysts were surprised the transaction was not accompanied by a placing of
SBE stock by Fininvest to raise funds.
Such a placing is expected soon, with Fininvest eventually divesting up to
49 per cent of SBE's capital, although the first tranche may be smaller.
Trading in shares in Mondadori, which was suspended yesterday, is expected
to resume today or early next week.
Shareholders in Mondadori will be offered one SBE share for every one
Mondadori share held. Alternatively, they will be able to exchange four
Mondadori non-voting savings shares for three SBE shares. SBE has one equity
category.
The deal values Mondadori ordinary shares at L15,000 each, against a closing
price in Milan on Wednesday of L10,825, while savings shares are valued at
L11,250 each against a Wednesday close of L6,905. Should all Mondadori's
shareholders accept the deal, about 9.3 per cent of SBE will be floating.
The deal comes as part of a capital increase by SBE to L105bn (Dollars
68.8m) from L30bn, which will be subscribed by Fininvest in the form of
Mondadori shares.
The transaction marks a big strategy change for Mr Berlusconi, who has not
hidden his distaste for outside shareholders in his operations.
Only Mondadori and Standa, the retailing group bought by Fininvest in the
late 1980s, are quoted on the stock market.
The decision to float SBE and the expected placing of further stock reflects
Fininvest's need for cash to reduce borrowings and finance further
expansion. Mr Berlusconi is said to be keen to increase the size of his
group through acquisitions. However, Fininvest has been in a 'consolidation
phase' for some time owing to growing pressure on its financial resources.
Fininvest, which gained control of Mondadori after a battle for control with
Mr Carlo De Benedetti in 1990-91, owned almost 90 per cent of the ordinary
shares and 80 per cent of the savings stock. Last month it sold 20 per cent
of Mondadori's ordinary shares to SBE for L243.4bn.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Conrad Black, the Canadian and UK publisher, has begun to implement plans
to raise his interests' shareholding in John Fairfax, the Australian
newspaper group, to 25 per cent from 15 per cent.
Fairfax directors announced last night they had been notified that
Vanderkneep Holding, an associate of Mr Black's The Telegraph, had purchased
a parcel of options in Fairfax from Hellman and Friedman, the US investment
bank, and its associates.
The purchase, at a cost of about ADollars 30m (USDollars 21.5m), gives Mr
Black's interests the potential to increase their total stake in Fairfax to
about 21 per cent. The options, exercisable by the end of the year, are
unissued participating convertible notes which can convert into shares.
The purchases had been expected following a decision by the Federal
government earlier this year to allow Mr Black to increase his Fairfax stake
to 25 per cent, and to limit foreign ownership in the company to 30 per
cent.
The deal observes that position, with Hellman and Friedman's stake in
Fairfax reduced to 5 per cent.
Mr Black is expected to purchase Fairfax shares on the market to take his
interest in the company to the allowable 25 per cent.
Fairfax shares fell 6 cents to ADollars 2.16 on Australian stock exchanges
yesterday after closing at a peak on Wednesday. The other large shareholder
in Fairfax is Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian media operator, who recently
revealed a 10.45 per cent stake.
Following the sale of Mr Packer's near 10 per cent interest in Westpac
Banking Corporation earlier this week for more than ADollars 500m,
speculation has intensified that he may move to increase his Fairfax stake.
A partner in Hellman and Friedman, Mr Andrew Barger, said he was confident
of Fairfax's future and Hellman and Friedman expected to continue to be an
active participant in the company.
Meanwhile, the Federal opposition yesterday called on the Federal government
to release the advice it received before approving Mr Black's request to
raise his Fairfax stake.

EUROC, the Swedish cement group, has sold its 18.3 per cent shareholding in
Aker, the Norwegian cement, oil and gas technology group, for SKr640m
(Dollars 86.5m).
The share stake has been sold to a number of institutional Norwegian and
foreign investors.
Euroc said it would make a capital gain of SKr60m on the deal and that as a
result annual earnings would improve by about SKr40m.
Euroc said the disposal would reduce the group's interest-bearing debt by
NKr560m (Dollars 82.3m) to NKr3.2bn and strengthen its balance sheet.
Aker said that more than half of the shares were placed in Norway among
several institutional investors.
Norway's state social security fund becomes Aker's biggest shareholder with
13.2 per cent.
Uni Storebrand, the big insurer, will hold 9 per cent. Aker would not be
drawn on details of the foreign investors.
Mr Tom Ruud, Aker's chief executive, said the disposal had improved
liquidity and cleared the way for the planned listing on the London stock
exchange.

<TEXT>
AVESTA Sheffield, the newly-formed Anglo-Swedish stainless steel producer,
yesterday disclosed a first-quarter loss after financial items of SKr53m
(Dollars 7.2m) and said it planned to shut one of its three melting shops.
The company will close its Degerfors plant in Sweden, with the loss of some
380 jobs, to concentrate production on Avesta in Sweden and Sheffield in the
UK. The closure, which will cost an estimated SKr190m, will take place over
the next 12-18 months as additional capacity is built up at Avesta.
The company said its first-quarter figure was better than in the
corresponding 1992 period, although it did not provide a comparative figure
because Avesta only merged with the British Steel Stainless last November.
Sales in the latest three months amounted to SKr3.5bn, compared with
SKr11.8bn in the whole of 1992.
The company noted that the weaker Swedish and UK currencies and lower energy
and employer charges in Sweden had strengthened its competitiveness. But it
noted that it was getting little relief from market conditions.
The group said it was expecting its full-year result to be considerably
better than last year, when it sustained a SKr564m loss.

SAAB Automobile, the Swedish car group jointly owned by General Motors of
the US and Saab-Scania, showed the benefits of restructuring and
cost-cutting when it announced a sharp reduction in first-quarter losses
yesterday.
The company's deficit fell to SKr138m (Dollars 18.6m) from SKr293m in the
same 1992 period as revenues rose to SKr3.99bn from SKr3.9bn.
The company said it was starting to see the effects of a drive to cut costs
across all parts of its business.
However, Saab noted that it would only begin to feel the benefits of last
year's programme to cut 2,000 jobs to save SKr2bn in the second half of the
year.

FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Lufthansa recovery continues in
first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUFTHANSA, the troubled German state airline, yesterday announced a reduced
first-quarter loss and predicted that its loss for this year as a whole
would be less than that for 1992.
Mr Jurgen Weber said at a press conference that Lufthansa would press on
with cost-cutting measures, thus ensuring that the 1993 deficit would be
less than last year's pre-tax loss of DM297m (Dollars 186m).
This would be Lufthansa's second annual loss reduction. Last year's deficit
was DM34m, down from the DM331m pre-tax loss of 1991. Mr Weber's oft-vaunted
goal is to return the airline to the black by 1995.
In the first three months of the current year, the airline's group loss
narrowed to DM245m, down from DM386m in the first three months of last year.
The improvement was exaggerated by the effect of changes in the way of
accounting for depreciation, which benefited the figures by DM95m. But there
was a significant increase in capacity utilisation as the airline increased
its load factors in both freight and passenger business.
Costs dropped by 3.3 per cent for the quarter, reflecting a 6 per cent
reduction in staff levels to 48,251 employees from 51,335. Personnel costs
dropped by 7.6 per cent to DM1.08bn from DM1.17bn.
Mr Weber vowed to continue with cost-cutting over the course of the year,
but voiced the by-now familiar complaint that the government - which owns 51
per cent of the airline - should help to make the group more efficient.
He reiterated his condemnation of US air transport policy, which he said
encouraged bankrupt companies to survive under Chapter 11 arrangements
(which protect insolvent companies from creditors) and to 'ruin the market
with dumping prices'.

FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Nissan agrees deal to buy parts
from Toyota supplier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN, Japan's second largest carmaker yesterday took the unprecedented
step of agreeing to buy parts from a supplier affiliated to Toyota, its arch
rival and Japan's largest car manufacturer.
The deal is the clearest challenge yet to the traditional structure of the
Japanese car industry, in which car manufacturers are supported by a vast
hinterland of suppliers dedicated to that car maker.
By taking this move, Nissan and Toyota are signalling to other makers and
suppliers that they are not opposed to cost cutting measures which involve
companies from different corporate groupings.
The agreement marks a departure for Japan's car makers which are
restructuring to cut costs in response to deeply depressed domestic sales,
stagnant export markets and heavy fixed costs from past investment.
The agreement is for Nissan to purchase about Y1bn (Dollars 9m) worth of
engine parts a year from Aisan Industry, an affiliated supplier in which
Toyota has a large minority shareholding.
The deal is small and does not come into operation until 1995 but it could
well pave the way for other car manufacturers to break the strict
demarcation lines between suppliers for different car makers.
Nissan will buy vacuum pumps from Aisan Industry. The parts which are used
in diesel engines for Toyota's Camry and Corona models will be used, without
modification, in two of Nissan's six types of diesel engine.
Nissan executives indicated that Aisan's vacuum pumps were more reliable
than the pumps it uses.
Some car industry executives predicted that the deal would pave the way for
Nissan and Toyota to cut costs by jointly designing and procuring common
engine parts, including commercial vans and trucks as well as cars.
Japanese car manufacturers are planning to cut the number of components they
use by up to 40 per cent in an attempt to cut costs.
It is likely that this will lead to a sharp reductions in the number of
suppliers affiliated to car manufacturers.

FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: VW sees second-term deficit cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's biggest carmaker, yesterday said that it would make a
loss in the second quarter of the current year but it would be much smaller
than the DM1.2bn (Dollars 750m) deficit posted in the first three months.
In a letter to shareholders, Volkswagen indicated that it would start making
profits again in the second half of the year and would be able to report a
positive result for the year as a whole.
These confident comments reiterated the message given by Mr Ferdinand Piech,
VW's chief executive, at the group's press conference at the end of March.
It was then that he revealed the scale of the first-quarter loss - but said
that the worst was over.
The comments support investors' confidence that VW's aggressive cost-cutting
measures would bear fruit later this year, possibly allowing the company to
pay a dividend after the pay-out for 1992 was cut to DM2 from DM11 in 1991.
VW's shares added DM4.50 yesterday to close at DM322.
The company is planning to shed 20,000 jobs this year out of a total of
36,000 job cuts to take effect by the end of 1997. The company's commitment
to tackling its bloated cost base was underscored by the hiring of Mr Jose
Ignacio Lopez, the Spanish purchasing chief who left General Motors to join
Volkswagen at the end of March.
BMW yesterday announced that sales for the first four months of the year had
dropped by 8.3 per cent to DM9.67bn. Production of cars fell by 11.5 per
cent to 189,528 units, showing that the company was not immune to the
downturn in the German car sector.
However, the Bavaria-based company continued to escape the worst of the
problems: in Germany the number of new passenger vehicle registrations in
the first quarter of the year fell 21.5 per cent.
Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, speaking at his last shareholders' meeting as
chief executive, said that BMW would deliver a healthy profit for the full
year.

FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Inntrepreneur needs further Pounds 130m
injection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAND METROPOLITAN and Courage will each have to inject another Pounds 65m
into Inntrepreneur Estates, their pubs joint venture, in October to comply
with banking covenants.
The two companies each paid Pounds 32m into IEL last year to meet the banks'
requirements.
GrandMet also announced changes in its policy of converting IEL pubs to
20-year leases which has aroused opposition from tenants who claimed that
the rent increases involved were forcing them out of business.
The failure rate of IEL's pubs has been running at about 9 per cent a year.
With 70 per cent of the 6,800 pubs on the new leases, the banks have agreed
that IEL will not now be required to convert 90 per cent of the pubs to
leases by March next year.
Mr David Tagg, chief executive of GrandMet's UK retailing division, said
that the move would give 'greater operational flexibility to respond to
current trading conditions.'
Mr Tagg indicated that hard-pressed tenants of about 10 per cent of IEL's
pubs would now be offered three-year leases though the long-term target of
converting all the estate to 20-year leases would remain.
GrandMet and Courage will share operating losses of Pounds 12m at
Inntrepreneur for the six months to March.
Operating profits declined from Pounds 83m to Pounds 79m, because of pub
disposals, and interest charges amounted to Pounds 92m.
Sir Allen Sheppard, GrandMet chairman and chief executive, however, repeated
yesterday that the venture was trading in line with expectations.
A further revaluation of the estate is due in September.
Last year's revaluation showed a reduction of Pounds 234m in the value of
the estate to Pounds 2.17bn; IEL's net assets have fallen from Pounds 582m
to Pounds 320m over the past year.
Disatisfied Inntrepreneur lessees last year formed Nail, a national lobbying
group, to press for changes in rents and terms with GrandMet and in the
courts.
MPs took up the issue in March when the Commons agriculture commitee
cross-examined IEL executives about the impact of leases on pub tennants and
local communities.

FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Lex set to sell Arrow stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEX SERVICE, the motor distribution and leasing company, plans to sell its
remaining 17.5 per cent stake in Arrow Electronics of the US.
Lex has filed a registration statement with the SEC and the sale is expected
shortly. At current market prices, the disposal will raise about Pounds
100m.
Lex took the stake in return for selling its North American electronics
business to Arrow in 1991. Its original 36 per cent holding has fallen
because of share sales and a share issue by Arrow.
Under the original agreement, Lex was required to sell its stake once
Arrow's shares traded above Dollars 22 (Pounds 14.20) for more than 60 days.
Although this requirement was triggered last August, the two sides agreed to
defer the sale.
Lex's remaining 5.21m shares have a book value of Pounds 37m but at
Wednesday's closing price of Dollars 32 3/4 the stake is worth more than
Dollars 170m. Lex said the profit on the sale, after tax, would be taken as
an exceptional in this year's results.
Lex's shares, together with 500,000 shares being issued by Arrow, are being
underwritten by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Securities.

FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Warner Howard up 9% on rentals growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WARNER HOWARD, the hot air hand dryer and commercial laundry equipment
company, reported full-year pre-tax profits up 9 per cent to Pounds 6.24m,
compared with Pounds 5.7m.
Turnover for the year to February 28 rose to Pounds 23.2m (Pounds 22.2m).
Rentals, more popular in recessions, contributed about Pounds 12m.
Hand dryer rentals improved to Pounds 4.49m (Pounds 3.81m) and laundry
equipment rentals climbed to Pounds 7.56m (Pounds 7.34m). Catering rentals
fell to Pounds 409,000 (Pounds 470,000).
Sales of laundry equipment rose to Pounds 2.53m (Pounds 1.86m) bringing the
division into break-even compared with losses last time, mainly because of a
contract with a 1,200-bed hotel in St Petersburg, Russia.
Sales of hand dryers fared less well, falling to Pounds 1.73m (Pounds
1.82m). Profits declined about Pounds 100,000 because of extra marketing
costs. Catering sales fell to Pounds 3.84m (Pounds 4.37m), because of
'weakness in equipment sales' which hit Eurolectrics.
Service contracts improved to Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 2.46m).
The company made an extraordinary provision of Pounds 337,000 for liability
on a lease assigned to a third party in 1980 which went into liquidation in
1991.
The company generated about Pounds 1.7m net cash, ending the year with a
Pounds 400,000 positive balance, after two small rental contract
acquisitions. Capital expenditure was Pounds 3.4m and depreciation was
Pounds 2.4m. Interest payments fell to Pounds 9,000 (Pounds 135,000).
The board proposes a final dividend of 0.38p (3.975p). It paid a second
interim of 4p on April 5 after an earlier 2.12p (1.925p), because of
increased advance corporation tax. The total for the year is 6.5p (5.9p).
Earnings were 18.74p (17.16p) per share.

FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Life Sciences pays Pounds 33.5m for Finnish
group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFE SCIENCES International, the scientific instruments manufacturer, is
expanding its international business by acquiring Labsystems, a
Helsinki-based instruments group, for FM285m (Pounds 33.5m).
The purchase will be partly funded by the placing of 9.37m shares at 129p to
raise about Pounds 12m after costs.
Sir Christopher Bland, chairman, said: 'The acquisition of Labsystems is
another step forward in our strategy of building an international scientific
equipment business.'
Labsystems, which employs 780 people, is a leading manufacturer of branded
scientific equipment and consumable products for the clinical, research and
industrial laboratory markets.
Its products and main geographic markets are seen as complementing those of
Life Sciences. In particular it has a strong customer presence in Europe
while Life Sciences' main customer strength is in North America.
Last year it reported trading profits of FM34.8m on sales of FM362.7m using
average exchange rates. Pre-tax profits, after charging interest on
borrowings, the bulk of which will not be assumed by Life Systems, totalled
FM10.4m. Based on year-end exchange rates, which reflect a significant
depreciation in the markka late last year, the company reported trading
profits of FM39m and had net assets of FM250m.
Labsystems is quoted on the Finnish OTC market. Saastopankkien
Keskus-Osake-Pankki, the parent company of a Finnish-based banking group,
owns 97 per cent of the shares which carry 99 per cent of the voting rights.
Life Sciences will satisfy the total consideration by assuming FM64m of
Labsystems' borrowings, making a cash payment of about FM119m and by way of
the placing which is designed to raise the equivalent of FM102m and will be
undertaken by Robert Fleming.
The cash consideration will be provided under a bank facility arrangement
and following the acquisition Life Sciences' gearing is expected to be about
60 per cent.
In March the group reported a 12 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for
1992 to Pounds 20.6m. Directors said yesterday that 1993 had started
satisfactorily with orders, sales and profits for the first quarter ahead of
last year.

FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Simon Eng shares decline to 52 1/2p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Simon Engineering yesterday continued their sharp decline,
triggered by Wednesday's profit warning and worries about the company's
financial strength.
The shares, which opened on Wednesday at 100p, yesterday fell from 73 1/2 p
to 52 1/2 p in heavy trading.
The fall was prompted by the company's confirmation that an expected
first-half loss this year will breach a banking covenant on levels of
interest cover. The company said its bankers remain supportive and no other
covenants were in danger.
The shares were further undermined by a profits downgrade from Smith New
Court. The broker yesterday forecast Simon would incur a Pounds 6m loss this
year, with no dividend, instead of a profit of Pounds 7.3m.
Simon, involved in access equipment and process engineering, has seen its
shares fall from a peak last year of 301p. Following a sharp outflow of cash
in the last 12 months, gearing has passed 100 per cent.

cent, enabled Abtrust New Thai Investment Trust to finish the year to
February 28 with the figure 76.6 per cent higher at 133.02p, against 75.34p

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rank Organisation, the leisure and entertainments group, yesterday told a
meeting of financial analysts that up to the middle of April trading results
from continuing operations were marginally ahead of last year.
Trading conditions had not altered significantly since January, when the
group announced lower pre-tax profits of Pounds 230.1m (Pounds 250.5m) for
the year to October 31.
Results from UK businesses had been mixed. Trading in North America
continued to improve, but other markets remained difficult.
Rank Xerox's and Fuji Xerox's first quarter results to January 31 were lower
than last year as market conditions remained difficult in Europe and the Far
East.
However, there had subsequently been some signs of improvement in Japan.

PWS Holdings, the Lloyds's insurance and reinsurance broking group, reported
static pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.07m for the six months to March 31,
against Pounds 2.1m.
A 5 per cent increase in brokerage income was offset by reduced investment
gross income of Pounds 9.27m (Pounds 9.2m) because of lower UK and US
interest rates.
Earnings per share came out at 6.4p (6.8p) and the interim dividend is

Net asset value per share of I&amp;S UK Smaller Companies Trust rose to 97.08p
over the 12 months ended March 31, an improvement of 9 per cent on the
88.96p standing a year earlier.
Available revenue advanced from Pounds 422,000 to Pounds 752,000.
Earnings slipped from 4.03p to 3.59p - the figure being based on the 20.97m
shares that were in issue throughout the year compared with a 1992 figure
based on a weighted average of 10.48m shares.
A recommended final dividend of 1.8p makes a 2.8p (2p) total.

the merger between First Charlotte Assets Trust and Clydesdale Investment
Trust.

FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Relocation puts Chemex Intl in loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The costs of moving premises put Chemex International, the chemical analysis
company, back into loss in the first half to March 31.
After making its first annual profit of Pounds 52,000 in the 12 months to
September 30 1992, the company reported an operating loss of Pounds 53,700
in the period under review, which it attributed mainly to the loss of
business during the move.
Exceptional items totalling Pounds 43,000 increased the loss before tax from
Pounds 64,900 in the previous first half to Pounds 94,200.
The exceptional items consisted of Pounds 16,600 in relocation costs
together with the Pounds 26,400 cost of the capital reduction, which
effectively halved the number of shares in issue.
Mr Brian Webbe, chairman, said that in the long term the relocation would
reduce property costs by about Pounds 50,000 per year, increase usable space
by 50 per cent and improve efficiency.
Sales rose 36 per cent to Pounds 610,600 (Pounds 450,300).

Net revenue from properties was Pounds 2.7m (Pounds 2.53m) plus surplus on

FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions and US revival behind Danka
increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACQUISITIONS and a revival in the US business economy helped boost annual
pre-tax profits at Danka Business Systems, the office equipment supplier, by
63 per cent to Pounds 17.5m on sales ahead 62 per cent to Pounds 186.3m.
Mr Dan Doyle, chief executive, said the US-based company had purchased nine
businesses last year, adding Pounds 22m in sales and Pounds 1.4m in profits.
Stripping out the acquisitions, Mr Doyle said operating profits for the year
to March 31 were ahead 42 per cent at Pounds 17.4m.
The final dividend is raised 20 per cent to 3p for a total of 4.5p (3.75p).
Earnings were up 58 per cent at 42.2p.
Mr Doyle said much of the profits growth came from the release of pent up
demand for office equipment, which many businesses had delayed replacing
during the recession. The improvement was also due to the restructuring of
many businesses purchased in the previous year.
Mr Doyle said the group intended to pursue acquisitions in the current year,
funding purchases through cash flow and recently increased banking
facilities. Earlier this week, Danka paid Dollars 7.2m (Pounds 4.67m) for
three businesses in the US, with turnover of more than Dollars 30m.
The group also announced plans for a 4-for-1 share split, aimed at improving
marketability. The shares closed 13p higher at 783p.

FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Eagle Star settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EAGLE STAR, the insurance subsidiary of BAT Industries, yesterday announced
that it had settled another stage of the complex litigation stemming from
disputed mortgage indemnity insurance policies.
Mr Maurice Markovitz, an insurance agent, agreed to pay Eagle Star Pounds
4.08m in respect of counter indemnities which he had given to the company
over the sale of mortgage indemnity policies to Banque Bruxelles Lambert and
Arab Bank.
In January, Eagle Star agreed to pay a maximum of Pounds 87.5m to settle the
dispute with BBL, which lodged an insurance claim on policies covering
commercial property loans after borrowers, including Land Property Trust,
defaulted during 1990.
Last month Eagle Star and BBL reached a separate agreement with the valuer,
Lewis &amp; Tucker, whose valuations of some of the properties involved were
alleged to be negligent. The valuer agreed to pay Pounds 25m, with half of
these proceeds directed to Eagle Star.
A separate action by both Eagle Star and BBL against a second valuer, John D
Wood Commercial, continues.
Mr Markovitz also agreed to withdraw all claims against Eagle Star including
claims arising out of the Anton Piller Order which the insurer obtained
against him in 1990.

FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Bank of Ireland jumps to IPounds
124m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANK OF Ireland, one of the Republic's two main clearing banks, increased
pre-tax profits by 76 per cent from IPounds 70.3m to IPounds 124m (Pounds
122m) in the year to March 31, due primarily to reduced losses in its UK and
US divisions.
Mr Pat Molloy, group chief executive, said FNH, the New Hampshire subsidiary
which has cost the group about Dollars 600m (Pounds 390m) in write-offs and
cash injections since 1988 when it ventured into the US market, had now had
its balance sheet 'substantially cleaned up' and was producing an operating
profit.
Loan loss provisions in the US were IPounds 66m in 1992, resulting in a
reduced pre-tax loss of IPounds 45.4m (IPounds 76.6m).
The Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio slipped from 7 per cent to 6.6 per cent.
The group's core business in Ireland has continued to perform well, despite
reduced economic growth in 1992 and the currency crisis last autumn.
Pre-tax profits in the retail arm rose 2 per cent to IPounds 135m.
The corporate finance and treasury division increased profits to IPounds
65.1m (IPounds 58.4m), despite a loan loss provision of IPounds 32m. Mr
Molloy said the treasury arm 'benefited from the extraordinary volumes of
business during the currency crisis.'
The group suffered embarrassment last week, when its Davy Stockbrokers
subsidiary - the largest broking firm in Ireland - slipped up on the
placement by the government of 30m shares in Greencore.
The placement nearly had to be scrapped after Davy revealed that it had sold
shares to groups with which it was closely connected. The placement was
saved when the Bank of Ireland stepped in to buy 9.6m of the shares at a
cost of IPounds 26m.
Davy is under investigation by the Irish Stock Exchange for having provided
'misleading information' during the placement.
Mr Molloy defended the move yesterday saying: 'It was a correct and
appropriate decision to stabilise the situation.' He added, however, that
the group was not carrying out its own investigation into Davy's handling of
the placement and was not planning any management changes at the subsidiary
pending the outcome of the investigation. 'I am not going to prejudge their
findings' he said.
Earnings per share jumped to 13.7p (4.5p). The final dividend of 6.5p makes
an increased total of 9.83p (9.17p).
COMMENT
The bank's first dividend increase for three years has been good news for
shareholders who have suffered patiently as the management wrestled with its
calamitous ill-timed decision to follow its arch-rival, Allied Irish Banks,
into the US banking market in the late 1980s. The group's US loan book has
been largely sorted out, the non-performing property portfolio mostly
disposed of, and is now showing the first real prospects of showing some
return for the Dollars 700m it has thrown at its US division since 1988.
Brokers are now revising upwards their earnings forecasts for the current
year to about 23p. Although the corner has been turned, institutions will
not be eager for a rights issue this year to shore up the equity base,
expecting that to be generated from improved cash-flow. Neither can the
group afford further problems such as has been created by the Greencore
share placement, and suggests that management reins could be tightened

FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Hoare Govett smaller cos trust launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hoare Govett is launching its second specialist smaller companies investment
trust within six months. The new trust, like the first, will attempt to
track the extended Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index (excluding
investment trusts).
The Second HGSC Investment Trust is aiming to raise between Pounds 25m and
Pounds 50m. The trust will have just one class of share and investors will
have the right to vote on the wind-up of the trust after 10 years.
Hoare Govett's first indexed investment trust raised Pounds 28.5m in
December and has since traded at a premium to net asset value.
Small company shares have tended to outperform larger companies over the
long term. However, they have only recently shown signs of recovery after
four years of underperformance, prompted by high interest rates and
recession.
The managers said that discussions with institutions indicated that they
would prefer a new issue to a rights issue from the existing trust. The full
prospectus is expected to be issued in the first week of June.

FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Shell pleases City with rise to Pounds 971m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Dutch/Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil group, took the City by surprise
yesterday with first quarter profits significantly higher than forecast.
The company's shares rose 20 1/2 p to 612 1/2 p.
Net income for the opening quarter of 1993 on a current cost basis, which
strips out the effects of holding oil stocks, rose 12 per cent to Pounds
971m.
The company registered gains in all of its divisions in spite of lower oil
prices, declining refining margins in Europe and continued over-capacity in
the chemicals sector.
'These results clearly show how well Shell's regional diversification is
paying off,' said Mr Nick Clayton, energy analyst at Hoare Govett, the UK
stockbroker.
Shell is seeing most growth in its Latin American and Asian businesses where
the company has targeted investment in the past 10 years.
Mr Clayton pointed out that Shell's assets in the Far East had grown from a
value of Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) in 1985 to Dollars 22bn last year as it
had switched its emphasis away from the US. Shell has seen volumes continue
to rise in the Far East while Europe has seen a downturn.
In the first quarter, sales volumes in Europe were down 6 per cent but in
the Far East they rose by 5 per cent and were up 7 per cent in Latin
America. Mr Clayton estimated that Shell earned a 12 per cent return on its
investment in the Far East compared with 5 per cent in the US.
The company reported a rise in earnings from its exploration and production
division to Pounds 584m (Pounds 465m) even though oil production slipped by
3 per cent to 2.16m barrels a day. The division benefited from a lower tax
rate, the depreciation of sterling against the dollar and higher gas prices
in the US.
Downstream earnings from Shell's refining and petrol sales operations rose
by 18 per cent to Pounds 455m with oil product sales increasing by 3 per
cent overall.
Chemicals lost Pounds 22m compared with profits of Pounds 20m in the same
period last year, but showed an improvement from the fourth quarter when the
loss reached Pounds 183m. The company's metals division which it is
currently negotiating to sell to South Africa's Gencor lost Pounds 3m.
Shell's financial position remained strong during the quarter with the
debt-to-equity ratio falling to just over 3 per cent. The company had a net
cash inflow of about Pounds 1bn after cashflow from operations of Pounds
2.1bn and capital expenditure of Pounds 1.2bn.

FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: BAT enhanced scrip gets 92% acceptance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ENHANCED scrip dividend offered by BAT Industries has been accepted by
holders of 92 per cent of the tobacco and financial services conglomerate's
ordinary shares.
The success of the offer means that BAT will retain about Pounds 308m in
dividends and Pounds 89m in advance corporation tax due on the dividend.
BZW, which designed the scheme, received acceptance of its cash alternative
of 32.2p per share from 14 per cent of the shareholders who elected to take
the enhanced scrip.
A late offer of a higher cash alternative of 33.22p per share from Swiss
Bank Corporation was accepted by 7 per cent of elections made under the
enhanced scheme.
As previously announced, both groups of shareholders will receive SBC's
higher cash offer. Cheques for shareholders who elected for cash will be
sent out by BZW, which will pass through all the shares to SBC.
RTZ Corporation, the mining group, said it would issue 29.5m new shares in
connection with its enhanced scrip scheme, which was accepted by holders of
89 per cent of the group's shares.
The number of shares was determined by the value of the enhanced scrip
dividend alternative at 20.25p per share, and reference price per share of
612.83p, based on the average share price between May 10 and 12. For each
1,000 shares the enhanced scrip alternative is worth Pounds 202.50, which
will be rounded to 33 new shares.

FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Zeneca and FT-SE indices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT-SE Actuaries UK Indices Committee has released a statement clarifying
how the demerger of ICI and Zeneca will affect constituents of the FT-SE
Actuaries Share Indices. The text follows:
Both ICI and Zeneca are expected to become constituents of the FT-SE 100
index when Zeneca becomes officially listed. The demerger would thus
necessitate the removal of one constituent in order to retain 100 companies
in the index.
Once the demerger comes into effect on June 1 1993, all constituents of the
FT-SE 100 will be ranked by size and the smallest capitalised constituent at
this time will be removed from the FT-SE 100. Based on current market
valuations, both ICI and Zeneca would qualify to become constituents of the
FT-SE 100 on implementation of the merger.
The company removed from the FT-SE 100 will become a constituent of the
FT-SE Mid 250. The constituents of this index will be ranked by size and the
smallest constituent will be moved to the FT-SE SmallCap.
The treatment of demergers is governed by Rule 7.2.3 of the Ground Rules for
the Management of the FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices.

FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Mystery bidder gets in contact with
HunterPrint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNTERPRINT, the specialist printer, revealed yesterday that it had been
contacted by an unidentified potential bidder for the group.
The sharp rise in the share price this week prompted the board to issue a
statement yesterday and bring forward the announcement of HunterPrint's
interim results by a week.
In the statement Mr Jeoff Samson, chairman, said the company had been
contacted by third parties, but that the contacts were at a preliminary
stage and 'may or may not lead to an offer being made for the company.'
HunterPrint's share price had risen from 64p at the end of last week to 75p
at the close on Wednesday. It gained another 5p yesterday to close at 80p,
valuing the group at Pounds 46.3m.
Mr Samson, who together with Mr Tony Caplin, chief executive, pushed through
a refinancing package including a Pounds 20m rights issue late last year,
said the board had been advised to make the statement following the share
price increase.
For the six months to end-March HunterPrint showed a turnround in
profitability following the restructuring. The group returned profits of
Pounds 330,000 pre-tax compared with a Pounds 3.85m loss in the year-ago
period.
Sales fell by 7.5 per cent to Pounds 26.6m (Pounds 28.8m) reflecting the
continuing difficult trading conditions in the group's sector of the
printing industry.
Nevertheless, a Pounds 2.3m loss on ordinary activities before interest was
turned into a Pounds 909,000 profit in the latest six months and net
interest charges fell from Pounds 1.54m to Pounds 579,000 reflecting the
improved state of the balance sheet following the refinancing and rescue
rights issue  - HunterPrint's second in two years.
The first involved Sir Ian MacGregor, who was ousted as chairman in August.
Mr Samson said the greater financial stability and strength had enabled the
group to increase its customer base and generate additional orders from
existing clients.
Contract orders at the group's Corby printing site now account for 50 per
cent of the workload compared with 39 per cent 12 months ago.
However, Mr Samson said the markets served by the Corby site  - newspapers,
publishing and direct mail  - showed no signs that 1993 would produce better
prices. The spot market remained very competitive and margins on spot work
continued to be under pressure.
Similarly, the Hardy Business Forms subsidiary continued to experience
difficult market conditions, but managed to return to 'modest' profitability
in the first half.

FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Burton at top of expectations - Cost
savings based on replacing full-time with part-time jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURTON GROUP, the clothing retailer, announced first half profits at the top
end of expectations following a wide-ranging cost-cutting programme
including 4,000 job cuts and an unexpected pension fund holiday.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to February 27 were Pounds 24.7m, against
Pounds 21.8m. Sales were ahead 14 per cent from Pounds 934.6m to Pounds
1.07bn.
The pre-tax figure was taken after higher than expected redundancy costs of
Pounds 11.9m. However, Mr John Hoerner, the former Debenhams chief and now
Burton chief executive who has been credited with pulling the group from the
brink of collapse, said he did not expect further charges in the second
half.
The charges were partially offset by the absence of a Pounds 3.8m payment to
the pension fund. The holiday was expected to contribute a further Pounds
3.8m in the second half of the year.
Mr Hoerner said Burton's best practice programme, which entails the
reduction in the number of full-time jobs and an increase in part-time
employees, was expected to contribute cost savings of between Pounds 25m and
Pounds 30m next year. In 1993, Burton expected to make about half the
savings.
The chairman said the first half had been focused on improving the group's
competitiveness, while maintaining better control over discounting. This
meant introducing lower initial prices through both better buying and a
decline in margins.
The trading pattern showed that sales had been largely discount driven. As a
result, gross margins fell by 2.3 percentage points.
The multiple retailing division, which includes Top Shop, Principles and
Dorothy Perkins, showed a significant improvement with trading profits
rising from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 14.4m. Debenhams, the department store,
increased its contribution by 36 per cent to Pounds 40m.
The proposed final dividend is maintained at 1p. Earnings fell from 1.9p to
1.4p. The shares advanced 4p on the day to 85p, a little below the high
point for the year.
COMMENT
The pension fund holiday comes as a handy damper to the unexpected costs of
paying for almost 4,000 redundancies. The big question now will be to what
extent Burton has managed to put a floor under its gross margin. Even Mr
Hoerner is prepared to say the trading environment is, and looks likely to
remain, severely competitive. On the other hand, optimists point to the high
degree of operational gearing, the benefits yet to be reaped from the
redundancy and store refurbishment programme. The prospects in the second
half are for a reasonable profit, on a modest sales increase. Forecasts for
this year are for Pounds 40m, on what appears to be a towering prospective
p/e of 35 times. The potential looks better further out, when the p/e falls
to a more approachable 23 on a conservative profits forecast ofPounds 70m.

SHARES OF Bluebird Toys rose 25 1/2 p to 219p yesterday on news that the

As a result orders in the home market were 'materially' up on last year and
overseas orders were more than 50 per cent ahead.
For the year to end-December 1992 the company swung from losses of Pounds
3.55m to profits of Pounds 1.55m pre-tax from turnover of Pounds 46m (Pounds

<TEXT>
SKANDINAVISKA Enskilda Banken, Sweden's leading commercial bank, plans to
take its first step into the UK insurance market through the purchase of
Interlife Assurance, an Essex-based life insurance company.
The Swedish bank, which is carrying out the deal through its SE-Banken
Forsakring insurance unit, wants access to the British company's licence so
that it can offer Swedish customers international alternatives to domestic
unit linked insurance schemes.
Interlife had 1992 premium income of Pounds 4.4m with funds under management
totalling some Pounds 11.5m. The operation is being sold by a group of
European insurance companies comprising Aachen Re of Germany, Trygg-Hansa
SPP of Sweden and Interamerican of Greece.
SE-Banken said finalisation of the deal was subject to the settlement of a
legal dispute between Interlife and Lautro, the regulatory authority.
SE-Banken Forsakring generated SKr600m (Pounds 53m) in premium volume from
new sales in the first quarter of 1993; its assets total SKr3.6bn.

FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Plantation side behind 13% lift at Jas
Finlay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JAMES FINLAY, the overseas trading and financial services group, lifted
pre-tax profits by almost 13 per cent from a restated Pounds 8.95m to Pounds
10.1m in 1992, thanks in large part to the performance of the plantations
side.
The division lifted operating profits from a restated Pounds 4.28m to Pounds
8.78m.
Turnover climbed to Pounds 165.2m (Pounds 143.7m).
Operating profits rose to Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 10.9m), after operating
expenses of Pounds 29.1m (Pounds 26.3m) and a deficit on currency exchange
of Pounds 967,000 (Pounds 144,000).
Associated undertakings brought in losses of Pounds 636,000 (profits Pounds
300,000); investment income and interest receivable accrued Pounds 1.32m
(Pounds 1.19m); the flotation of 25 per cent of James Finlay &amp; Co (Colombo)
made Pounds 893,000; while interest payable grew to Pounds 3.67m (Pounds
3.43m).
The tax charge leapt to Pounds 5.32m (Pounds 4.07m), resulting in lower
earnings per share of 4.7p (4.9p).
A second interim dividend of 2.15p keeps the total for the year unchanged at
4.15p.
Apart from plantations, the only division to lift operating profits was oil
and gas - to Pounds 310,000 (losses Pounds 188,000).
Trading, manufacturing and merchanting was more than halved at Pounds 1.11m
(Pounds 2.84m); confectionery and beverage manufacturing slipped to Pounds
4.21m (Pounds 4.54m); merchant banking and international confirming incurred
losses of Pounds 436,000 (profits Pounds 729,000); and property eased to
Pounds 327,000 (Pounds 369,000).
Head office costs of Pounds 2.12m (Pounds 1.7m) included a Pounds 750,000
provision for advances made by James Finlay Bank guaranteed by the parent.
By territory, Africa was the star, lifting profits to Pounds 9.24m (Pounds
5.18m); Asia grew to Pounds 1.31m (Pounds 344,000), but the UK fell to
Pounds 4.61m (Pounds 5.68m).
North America tumbled to losses of Pounds 1.55m, against profits of Pounds
391,000 and Australasia doubled its losses from Pounds 706,000 to Pounds
1.44m.

FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: NatWest to pull out of French branches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank is to withdraw from branch banking in France
following several years of losses.
The decision cast further doubt on British banks' retail banking operations
in continental Europe.
NatWest announced that it was negotiating the best way to withdraw from its
branch banking subsidiary - possibly through disposals.
The business has 10 branches and issued share capital of FFr1.13bn (Pounds
136m).
Mr Derek Wanless, group chief executive, said the decision to concentrate on
investment and private banking in France was part of an attempt to focus on
businesses capable of having 'a major profitable presence' in their markets.
Mr Wanless said the decision to withdraw was not based on poor trading
results in France last year.
NatWest's French retail bank suffered a Pounds 36m loss in 1992, and Pounds
21m in 1991.
The French deficit comprised a large part of the total loss of Pounds 44m
for NatWest's European business last year.
However, the bank reported a substantial increase in provisions for bad and
doubtful debts in both France and Spain.
Mr Wanless said NatWest believed retail banking was 'a national game' and
there was 'no such thing' as a pan-European retail banking business.
But the withdrawal had no specific implications for NatWest's Spanish
operations.
The bank said the withdrawal would result in a provision against assets, but
this would not have a material effect on group assets.
The withdrawal over the next 12 months, would include phased redundancy of
its 400 staff.
Other British banks, including Abbey National and Barclays, reported poor
results in France and Spain last year.
Barclays suffered a Pounds 98m loss in France, against a Pounds 3m profit in
1991, after being hit by poor property and corporate lending.
Barclays said it was still developing its French retail banking business
based on L'Europeene de Banque, which it bought in 1991.
It had opened 50 new offices this year, and intended to keep the operation.

FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: BT profits fall may be cloud with silver
lining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE THE sharp decline in profits, caused largely by the cost of its
redundancy programme, British Telecom's results provided evidence of
underlying strength.
Together with a generous increase in the dividend, it proved enough to keep
the company's shares buoyant yesterday.
The main grounds for optimism are:
Earnings. Excluding the cost redundancies and losses on four disposals, BT's
earnings per share were slightly ahead of the corresponding figure for last
year. In the fourth quarter they were up more than 11 per cent on that
basis.
Volumes. Volume growth in domestic calls was negligible, but there was 6 per
cent growth in international calls despite increased competition from
Mercury.
Operating costs. BT has shed nearly a third of its staff in three years; 19
per cent went last year alone, reducing gross staff costs by 8.1 per cent.
The current workforce of 171,000 is set to be cut by a further 30,000 over
the next two years.
Gearing. Strong cashflow allowed BT to cut its net debt from Pounds 2.5bn to
Pounds 1.76bn and gearing from 21 per cent to 14 per cent. BT should have
eliminated its debt by 1996, giving it large capacity to finance
acquisitions.
Moreover, the profits decline together with a 2 to 3 per cent loss of market
share over the year may help deflect calls for a review of BT's prices by
Oftel mid-way through the term of the existing agreement, which is due to
run until 1998.
As one analyst put it: 'if allowing the competition to get more of a
foothold reduces regulatory pressure, it could make BT more not less
attractive to investors.'
The unexpected Pounds 750m deficit in BT's pension fund failed to ruffle the
City.
BT's payment of some Pounds 1.1bn to the pension scheme this year will come
from the balance sheet which will be offset by the receipt of Dollars 1.8bn
(Pounds 1.2bn) from the sale of its stake in McCaw, the US cellular
telephone company, to American Telephone and Telegraph.
Nonetheless, analysts are not uniformly ecstatic.
Liberalisation is a two-way process: if BT breaks into the US, AT&amp;T will get
into Britain, and is already challenging BT to sharply cut wholesale call
rates.
At home, cable companies are fast building local phone networks, some
offering discounts on BT prices which will become more tempting still once
the re-sale market expands and portable telephone numbers are allowed.
Mr Iain Vallance, chairman of BT, insists the company has a masterly 'cable
defence strategy.'
He refused to give details yesterday but it appears to consist mainly of
reminding deserters to other carriers of the virtues of being directly
connected to the BT network.

FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: How a hole follows a holiday - BT's pension
scheme is Pounds 750m in deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecom ann-ounced yesterday that Pounds 750m had been wiped out of
its pension scheme between January and the end of March, outlining at a
single stroke the peculiar predicament of pension schemes all over the
country.
What lies behind the gaping hole is much more than simply an overstaffed UK
corporation trying to finance a swingeing redundancy programme. Instead, it
is the effect of new UK tax changes and the sharp drop in dividend growth at
UK companies which have left the BT scheme some 5 to 6 per cent short of the
cash it needs to meet its liabilities on an ongoing basis.
Certainly, BT's decision to axe 29,000 workers last year has had some
effect. Indeed, according to the pension scheme's accounts for the nine
months from March to December 1992 show that the redundancy programme
reduced a Pounds 913m surplus to Pounds 119m and noted that the company
would have to end its own contributions holiday beginning with the 1993-94
fiscal year.
But following a second actuarial valuation just three months later, the
scheme discovered the modest surplus had turned into a Pounds 750m deficit.
Mr Michael Hepher, managing director of BT, said that the government's
decision to cut the proportion of Advance Corporation Tax that pension funds
can reclaim from the Inland Revenue on dividends paid by UK companies had
effectively sliced Pounds 500m off the value of its assets.
Moreover, the anticipated income from dividend growth in UK equities has
simply not materialised over the past year.
Most actuaries have built an assumption of 5 per cent growth in UK dividends
into their valuations of scheme assets. Pension fund assets reflect not
market value but the anticipated income they will produce. Thus, lower
dividend income or lower tax rebates will have a fearsome effect on
valuations.
The assumption of annual dividend growth of 5 per cent is modest when seen
against the double digit growth of the late 1980s or even the 8 per cent
growth of 1991. But, according to Mr Andrew Collins, research actuary at
William M Mercer, dividends actually decreased by 0.1 per cent in 1992 and,
in the first quarter of this year, shrank an additional 1.8 per cent.
Actuaries now beginning scheme valuations are unlikely to change their
assumptions of dividend growth for the future. They are required to take a
long-term view and, over time, 5 per cent is considered a conservative
reckoning. However, Mr Collins added that actuaries might drop one or two
years' of assumed dividend income from their calculations of the value of
assets.
'If you knock out one year's dividend growth with an annual 5 per cent
growth assumption, you will knock 5 per cent off the value of your pool.'
For the approximate Pounds 7bn in UK equities in BT's scheme, such a
calculation would reduce the value of assets by Pounds 350m in the future.
Retrospectively, the lower-than-expected dividend growth wiped nearly Pounds
500m off the value of the pension scheme assets, said Mr Hepher. That, with
the ACT change, has left BT with a gaping chasm in its pension scheme -
actuaries see little reason why other UK pension schemes should not be
similarly affected.
'I do think that these ACT changes are quite significant,' Mr Hepher said.
In his budget address in March, Chancellor Norman Lamont announced that from
the current tax year, pension schemes and other tax-exempt investors would
only be able to reclaim 20 per cent of the dividend paid, down from the
previous 25 per cent. This had the effect of cutting the income on UK
equities by 6.25 per cent.
BT's pension scheme is about 58 per cent invested in UK equities and the
income cut is substantial. Moreover, actuaries must project the income cut
some 20 to 25 years into the future, compounding its effect. Mr Andrew
Wilson, research actuary at R Watsons, said that the Treasury may not have
fully understood the compound effects its tax changes would have.
'If you assume that BT is 4 per cent of the UK pension fund market, it would
account for about Pounds 24m of the Pounds 600m the tax change is expected
to raise. But if you compound that over 20 years, that will cost BT Pounds
480m,' he said.
Since the changes were announced, actuaries have been warning pension funds
that the tax changes might well force companies to either increase their
contributions to the pension scheme or make benefit cuts.
'The government may realise that there's more to their ACT changes than just
a little bit of tax being raised,' Mr Collins said.

FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Cerus sells stake in L Joseph
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CERUS, the French holding company controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the
Italian industrialist, has sold its 29.5 per cent stake in Leopold Joseph,
the London merchant bank.
Banque Dumenil-Leble, the Cerus-controlled financial institution which held
the stake, is understood to have placed it at about 230p, compared with an
unchanged closing price of 358p.
Hoare Govett took the shares in a bought deal and placed them with several
institutions.
A 7.8 per cent stake went to Fleming Mercantile Investment Trust, and a
similar holding to Gartmore.
Refuge Assurance remains the largest shareholder with 29.99 per cent.
Mr David Fletcher, joint chief executive, said Cerus had been a seller of
the stake for some time.
Cerus has been restructuring its financial interests.
Last January it sold Banque Dumenil Leble (Suisse), its majority-owned
Geneva-based fund management arm, to Banque Worms de Financement et
d'Investissement.

FT  14 MAY 93 / GPA Group - The Refinancing: Mixed reaction while
uncertainties exist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE HAS been a mixed welcome in the Irish Republic to the planned takeover
of GPA by GE Capital, as the uncertainties still surrounding it have raised
questions about whether the 'white knight' might end up getting a much
better deal than existing shareholders.
Mr Ruari Quinn, the minister for enterprise and employment, welcomed the
plan saying: 'It removes the uncertainty that the entire market was facing
and it does secure, it would appear at this stage, the future for GPA.'
He added that the complexity of the deal 'is going to require the skills of
a lot of people in GPA to put in place'.
The government's earlier offer to invest Dollars 20m (Pounds 13m) in GPA
through the Shannon Development Agency, was still on the table, Mr Quinn
said, subject to its being made 'on sound commercial grounds'.
The government has two principal concerns.
Firstly it wishes to salvage its existing investment in GPA. Through Aer
Lingus, the national airline, it has an 8.8 per cent holding, which prior to
the aborted flotation in 1992 was valued in Aer Lingus's books at about
IPounds 100m (Pounds 98m).
Secondly, GPA through its joint ventures in Shannon Aerospace and Shannon
Turbine Technologies in the Republic, has played a pivotal role in
establishing an aviation-related industrial park, which is planned to create
some 11,000 jobs over the next decade.
Brokers in Dublin, however, have been more circumspect. They say that the
key uncertainty surrounding the deal is the undisclosed price at which GE
plans to buy up to 80 per cent of GPA through new equity issues exercisable
until March 1997.
Irish institutional shareholders were unwilling to comment yesterday.
However, privately they were expressing concern that it would substantially
dilute their existing shareholdings and that it was too early to take a more
positive approach.
There are also worries that GE, by obtaining 45 of the most modern aircraft
in GPA's fleet, had taken control of some of the company's best earning
assets, but had not taken on any exposure to the company's liabilities in
the short-term.
'The key question is when will GE exercise its options to take a stake in
the company,' said one broker.
Irish investors in GPA, including Mr Tony Ryan, the chairman, hold about 20
per cent of its shares.
Mr Ivan Yates, the opposition finance spokesman for the Fine Gael party
said: 'I am pleased that GPA has avoided examinership or receivership, but I
see no reason whatsoever now for the state to be investing further in GPA
and risking taxpayers' money.'

FT  14 MAY 93 / GPA Group - The Refinancing: Transatlantic crossing to
cement relationship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TONY RYAN may have ceded control of the company he founded in 1975 but it
was his future boss, Mr Gary Wendt, chief executive of GE Capital, who was
yesterday forced to travel the Atlantic for their first one-to-one meeting
since their tentative deal was agreed.
While two of GPA's directors, Mr Patrick Blaney and Mr John Tierney, were
addressing bondholders in New York, Mr Ryan was busy cementing his
relationship with Mr Wendt at GPA's Shannon headquarters, in the Irish
Republic.
The two men got to know each other when Mr Wendt joined GPA's board as a
non-executive director after General Electric's financial services arm
bought a 22.7 per cent stake in 1983. Mr Wendt subsequently left the board
when GE Capital sold its stake in the middle eighties.
Over the past two months he has been in constant touch with Mr Ryan in New
York.
But yesterday Mr Wendt paid him the compliment of visiting him at his
headquarters to reassure the bulk of the staff that they will still have
jobs if GPA becomes a separate subsidiary of GE Capital. He has told Mr Ryan
he wants him to stay on as chairman for at least another two years.
However, Mr Wendt, as one of the group's lenders explained, 'is no
pushover'. A number of key posts at GPA are likely to be filled by GE
Capital, which owns Polaris Aircraft leasing, one of GPA's big competitors
with more than 400 aircraft on lease.
Under the terms of the deal, tentatively agreed on Tuesday night and
finalised by fax between New York, London and Dublin on Wednesday, GE
Capital will purchase aircraft, worth Dollars 1.35bn (Pounds 870m), and
co-sponsor ALPS2 (securitization of aircraft leases) which could raise up to
Dollars 700m.
It is still to agree, however, on what price it should pay for its option to
take 60 per cent of GPA's equity, rising to 80 per cent under certain
conditions by March 1997.
No one in the negotiations, which could continue for several months, expects
GE Capital to inject more than Dollars 400m, and some believe the US company
will try to get away with paying considerably less.
But as one of GPA's directors said: 'GE is no christmas tree. You do not
expect the world when you sign a deal at five minutes to midnight'.
While Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette were busy preparing the terms of a
moratorium on payments to bondholders with proposals for a debt-for-equity
swap, GPA had been warned by its lead bankers of the dire consequences of
failing to sign a deal with GE Capital.
At a briefing session of its main lenders on Tuesday, GPA was told that a
moratorium on bond payments would inevitably lead to examination, the Irish
equivalent to administration.
The group still has to overcome some formidable hurdles before the deal can
be finalised. It needs to raise Dollars 100m from its core bankers, in the
form of a bridging loan, and a further Dollars 100m to Dollars 150m from a
few of its investors led by its biggest shareholder, the Mitsubishi Trust
and Banking Corporation.
The new finance is required to honour the bond payments over the next two
months, the first Dollars 50m of which falls on May 17.
Mitsubishi, which owns 12 per cent of the shares, is expected to invest at
least Dollars 20m and the Irish government, through Shannon Development, is
willing to invest up to Dollars 20m (Pounds 13m).
While other shareholders have given indications of firm interest the banks
will have to convert the indications into hard cash over the next few days.

FT  14 MAY 93 / GPA Group - The Refinancing: Classic deal from a formidable
competitor - The move fits the mould of GE Capital snapping up assets from
distressed sellers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAILING out GPA Group is a classic deal for GE Capital.
It underscores why the financial services arm of General Electric of the US
has become such a formidable competitor at home and is rapidly becoming one
in international markets.
Its record of strong profits growth over the past decade and its powerful
capital base have allowed it to snap up assets from distressed sellers at
favourable prices during the waves of recession hitting sub-sectors of the
US financial services industry.
The GPA deal fits this mould.
Provided several potential stumbling blocks can be surmounted, it will allow
GE Capital to buy 43 aircraft from GPA for Dollars 1.35bn (Pounds 870m) with
an option to acquire between 60 and 80 per cent of GPA's equity over the
next four years at an undisclosed price.
GE Capital stressed yesterday that the aircraft were all less than three
years old, met modern Stage III noise standards and would only be acquired
with leases in place.
While many crucial aspects of the deal remained under wraps, GE Capital's
track record in striking hard bargains suggests that it will prove
financially good for the company, as well as having important strategic
benefits.
The US company is the main financial services arm of General Electric, which
has interests ranging from aircraft engine manufacturing to the NBC
television network.
GE Capital, together with two other GE financial services companies -
Employers' Reinsurance and Kidder, Peabody, the brokerage house - form GE
Capital Services with Dollars 155bn of assets.
GE Capital on its own, which comprises 23 niche businesses such as ship
container leasing and car purchase financing, has assets of Dollars 93bn,
making it one of the largest non-bank finance groups in the US.
Originally set up to provide credit to buyers of GE-made equipment, it grew
rapidly in the 1980s into areas traditionally dominated by commercial banks,
helped by a looser regulatory framework than the banks and the ability to
piggy back on its parent's strong credit rating.
Some other industrial companies followed a similar route, but several of
them, such as Westinghouse, were badly stung by financial services -
particularly commercial property - and have now withdrawn from the field or
sharply scaled down their operations.
GE Capital has prospered thanks to its strong management, focus on market
niches, extremely efficient credit controls, and a cautious approach to the
1980s commercial property boom.
The diversity of its businesses has also helped smooth out problems in
individual markets. Aircraft leasing, for example, accounts for less than 8
per cent of its assets, even after the GPA deal.
The agreement will, however, substantially increase the size of GE Capital's
already big aircraft leasing operations, mainly run under its Polaris
leasing company, with a fleet of nearly 500 aircraft.
Some 80 per cent of the existing fleet meets the stringent Stage III noise
regulations and GE Capital says some 95 per cent of the fleet is currently
being utilised.
If GE eventually acquired majority control of GPA it would create the
largest aircraft leasing company in the world, well ahead of
California-based ILFC, a subsidiary of the AIG insurance group.
As GPA's plight indicates, aircraft leasing has been an extremely tough
business during the airline recession of the past two years - though GE
Capital claims to have enjoyed 'very positive, favourable results.'
The US airline business, which accounts for most Polaris leases, is
beginning to show signs of a cyclical upturn, and GE is banking on the
global industry eventually following suit.
The GPA aircraft being acquired by GE Capital are leased to international,
rather than US carriers, and will give a big boost to the US company's
global presence.
Building up an international business is one of the group's most important
strategic thrusts.
It entered Europe at the start of this decade by buying up the finance
operations of UK stores chains Burton and House of Fraser and has followed
this with a series of acquisitions in both continental countries and the UK,
including the Pounds 71m current agreed bid for TIP Europe, the
British-based trailer rental company.
It is also beginning to establish a presence in Asia, having agreed over the
past year to make investments in various financial services operations in
Hong Kong, Malaysia and Indonesia.

FT  14 MAY 93 / GPA must raise Dollars 250m in a week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA GROUP, the troubled aircraft leasing company, needs to raise Dollars
250m (Pounds 162m) within a week before its rescue deal with GE Capital can
go ahead.
While the company's core lenders yesterday welcomed the last-minute
agreement with General Electric's financial services arm, they said GPA
needed to overcome a number of hurdles.
GPA yesterday told its bondholders, in a meeting in New York, that its board
would decide by Monday whether it would be able to close the deal with GE
Capital, enabling it to finance bond payments due over May and June.
GE Capital has yet to agree what price it will pay for its option to take a
65 per cent stake in the group, which could rise to 80 per cent by the end
of March 1997. However, it may insist that the banks write off at least 20
per cent of their Dollars 3bn borrowings as part of any deal to take a
controlling stake.
In the next few days the group's key lenders will be asked to provide
Dollars 100m as a bridging loan to help finance the bond payments. Some
existing shareholders will also be asked to provide a further Dollars 150m.
The total of Dollars 250m must be found before May 17, when the first
Dollars 50m of bond payments are due.
GPA's 138 banks will also have to provide further waivers of breaches on its
banking covenants until the end of June.
While most lenders are expected to agree, the group is not taking any bank
for granted given that four have still not agreed to the restructuring of
GPA's Dollars 5.5bn of borrowings.
The group also requires a waiver over the same period from the holders of a
Japanese club loan, worth Dollars 150m, with further extentions needed later
in the year. Harris Investment Management, a subsidiary of the Chicago-based
Harris Banking Corp, must waive its Dollars 45m put option.
GPA has warned its banks that the combined cost of restructuring, lost
deposits from aircraft manufacturers and falling aircraft values will lead
to provisions which could be Dollars 500m.
GE Capital has agreed in principle to buy Dollars 1.35bn worth of aircraft
from GPA. The group's bondholders are being advised by Blackstone Group, the
US investment bank which specialises in company restructuring, and lawyers
Wachtell, Lipton. Lazard Freres stepped down from advising bondholders
because it was trading the bonds.

FT  14 MAY 93 / GrandMet helped by devaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BOOST of Pounds 29m from sterling's devaluation helped lift first-half
pre-tax profits of Grand Metropolitan, the food, drinks and retailing group,
from Pounds 394m to Pounds 416m, a rise of 5.6 per cent.
At level exchange rates, profits would have declined 1.8 per cent.
GrandMet's shares lost 11p to close at 422p.
Currency translation of dollar-denominated debt also added Pounds 676m to
the group's net borrowings which rose to Pounds 3.16m, increasing gearing
from 70 per cent to 82 per cent.
Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and chief executive, said trading had remained
challenging and the pace of recovery in key markets remained difficult to
predict. 'We expect the US and UK to continue to improve gradually; but we
believe the continental European markets will increasingly be affected by
recession throughout 1993.'
Earnings per share for the six months to March 31 improved 3 per cent to
13.4p; the interim dividend is up 5.4 per cent to 4.85p.
The North American food business reported profits of Pounds 126m, 5 per cent
ahead in sterling but 10 per cent lower in local currency. Dollar profits of
the US Green Giant vegetable business were halved as the industry continued
to work through the surplus produced last summer and the market remained
'extremely soft and competitive'. The group is expanding into the fresh
produce market with sales of Green Giant vegetables of more than Dollars 50m
(Pounds 32.4m).
Operating profit from European food operations, affected by marketing
investments in Haagen-Dazs ice-cream and Pillsbury dough, as well as
deteriorating market conditions, fell from Pounds 4m to Pounds 1m.
IDV, the drinks division, contributed profits of Pounds 268m, 4 per cent
ahead in local currency. The group strengthened its market share in North
America where profits rose from Pounds 77m to Pounds 92m.
On the retailing side, Burger King moved profits 13 per cent up to Pounds
63m.
In the UK, the Chef &amp; Brewer managed pubs and GrandMet Estates, the property
division, raised profits 8 per cent to Pounds 28m though pub volumes were
lower.
GrandMet, which included a Pounds 6m trading loss from the Inntrepreneur
pubs joint venture with Courage in its accounts, announced that, subject to
revaluation, it will have to inject a further Pounds 65m into the company in
October to comply with banking covenants.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Land Securities in Pounds 140m bond issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAND SECURITIES, the UK's biggest property company, yesterday raised Pounds
140m for new property investment through a convertible bond issue and
announced a better than expected set of results for the year to March 31.
Its net assets per share fell by 9.2 per cent from 555p to 504p, which was a
less severe fall than most City analysts expected.
Its pre-tax profits rose by 2.6 per cent from Pounds 227.5m to Pounds
233.4m, and it raised its dividend by 5.1 per cent, reinforcing its
reputation as the most financially stable company in the UK property sector.
The shares rose 6p to 551p.
Mr Peter Hunt, chairman, was cautious about the outlook for the property
sector, saying that the recovery of the property market had historically
lagged the rest of the economy. However, he said that the valuation yields
of Land Securities' central London offices had improved, following a surge
in investment in the sector by overseas buyers.
Land Securities said it would use the proceeds of its bond issue to 'finance
property acquisitions as opportunities arose' and for general working
capital. It said it intended to buy buildings with growth potential,
primarily outside London.
Net rental income rose by 7.7 per cent to Pounds 380.7m. But the value of
the portfolio went down by 7 per cent to Pounds 4.1bn, which represents a
yield of 9.9 per cent on current income.
The company has tried to shift the balance of its portfolio towards
properties with more growth potential, with the acquisition of retail and
industrial property and the sale of over-rented central London offices.
During the year, the company spent Pounds 179.5m on acquisitions and Pounds
57.6m on developments and refurbishments. It made sales of Pounds 127.7m.
Since March 1988, the value of the portfolio's office content fell from 60
per cent to just under 45 per cent, retail increased from 39 per cent to
more than 50 per cent and industrial and warehouse property increased nearly
three-fold to nearly 5 per cent.
Earnings per share rose from 32.62p to 33.68p. A final dividend of 16.55p
per share was recommended, making a year total of 22.85p, 5.1 per cent.

FT  14 MAY 93 / BT pension scheme in Pounds 750m shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH TELECOM yesterday announced it had discovered a Pounds 750m
shortfall in its pension scheme as of the end of March, leaving it with 5 to
6 per cent too little cash to meet current liabilities.
Mr Michael Hepher, group managing director, said the shortfall reflected
much lower than expected dividend income and the effects of changes in
advance corporation tax announced in the March budget which have cut income
for pension funds all across Britain. Chancellor Norman Lamont cut the
percentage of ACT pension schemes could reclaim from the Inland Revenue to
20 per cent of the cash dividend from 25 per cent. The change cuts cash
generated by investments in UK equities by 6 1/4 per cent.
Also, instead of the 5 per cent per year dividend growth assumed by most
pension scheme actuaries for 1992, dividends actually fell by 0.1 per cent
and have shrunk a further 1.8 per cent in the first quarter of 1993.
The difficulties facing the British Telecom pension scheme are likely to be
mirrored in other UK pension schemes, actuaries said. UK equities constitute
the largest single investment category for UK pension schemes. The average
fund has 60 per cent of assets in that sector.
To cover the shortfall, BT will immediately inject Pounds 800m from its cash
reserves into the scheme and resume its corporate contributions, estimated
at Pounds 250m per year, according to Mr Hepher.
A further planned round of 15,000 redundancies for the current year is
expected to place an additional Pounds 250m 'strain' on the scheme by
year-end, he said. Mr Hepher said there are no plans to alter the pension
scheme or its benefit structure in any way as a result of the increased
cost. The cash injection will have no effect on the company's profits for
the current year except to produce a slight reduction in interest income.
However, the decision to front-end the expense removes one of the
uncertainties which could undermine the government's sale of its third stake
in BT later this year.
BT's scheme, in a valuation conducted at the end of December 1992, had a
surplus of Pounds 119m. Enhanced pension payments to 29,000 workers made
redundant over the past year reduced the surplus from Pounds 913m.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Daimler-Benz predicts upturn after 96% plunge in quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAIMLER-BENZ, Germany's largest industrial group, yesterday reported a
dramatic decline in net profits to only DM20m (Pounds 8.1m) for the first
quarter of 1993, down from the DM480m achieved in the same period last year.
Daimler described the result as 'exceptionally unsatisfactory', chiefly
blaming weak demand in the German car and commercial vehicle market which
hit Mercedes-Benz, the car manufacturer which generates two-thirds of the
group's sales.
Blighted by what Daimler called 'extremely difficult conditions' in world
car markets, car production at Mercedes dropped by 39 per cent in the
quarter to 94,500 units, down from 153,738 last year when conditions were
still what Daimler called 'highly favourable'.
The number of commercial vehicles produced fell by 27 per cent to 55,900.
The results were not noticeably out of line with analysts' expectations
after an accelerated drop in profits over the past two quarters of last
year. Daimler indicated last month that profits would be 'considerably down'
in the first quarter.
But the results served to intensify analysts' scepticism about Daimler's
ability to make the DM1bn profit for the whole of 1993 which it forecast
last month after announcing 1992 profits down 25 per cent to DM1.45bn.
Daimler yesterday predicted a 'significant upturn' later this year as a
result of the scheduled introduction in June of the new C-class Mercedes,
the replacement for the 10-year-old 190 series, the company's smaller
executive car.
For the Daimler-Benz group as a whole, total sales dropped 19 per cent to
DM18.4bn for the quarter.
First quarter sales at Mercedes dropped by 24 per cent to DM12.5bn.
Daimler said that the trend in group results was distorted by comparison
with a 'highly favourable' first quarter of last year.
'Business conditions deteriorated markedly only in the second half of last
year,' Daimler said.
At AEG, the electrical engineering unit which made operating losses of
DM200m last year, sales dropped 7 per cent to DM2.2bn in the three months.
At Deutsche Aerospace, sales were down 10 per cent to DM2.85bn, partially
because of invoicing factors.
Daimler-Benz InterServices, the services subsidiary, posted sales of DM2.1bn
against DM1.74bn.
Mercedes sales were hit especially hard by conditions in the domestic market
 -where total car registrations dropped by a fifth in the quarter - and in
other European countries and Japan.
Sales were 'gratifyingly higher' in other south-east Asian markets and in
eastern Europe.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Clarke U-turn over court fines: Home secretary's policy
shift seen as fillip for demoralised backbenchers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, ALAN PIKE and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is to abandon the controversial unit fines system. The
decision, announced yesterday, represents a surprise U-turn by Mr Kenneth
Clarke, home secretary.
The government intends to enact its proposed changes immediately by
incorporating them into the latest Criminal Justice Bill, due to start its
committee stage later this month.
The decision to rush through the proposals partly reflects the government's
need to lift the spirits of backbenchers demoralised by last week's election
disasters. Mr Clarke was encouraged by loud Tory cheers when he made his
statement.
Unit fines, under which individuals pay penalties according to their income,
have led to some people with above-average earnings being fined thousands of
pounds for relatively minor offences. They were introduced only in October,
and on May 4 Mr Clarke reiterated his support for the principle, but said
the banding on which the fines operated needed amending.
He told the Commons yesterday, however, that he had decided to abolish the
system altogether, as he had reached the conclusion that it would be
impossible to modify it satisfactorily. Magistrates will still be encouraged
to consider individuals' incomes when setting penalties, but there will be
no specific formula.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said he had never seen so quick a
collapse of government policy. 'Having spent weeks, if not months, robustly
telling us that the Criminal Justice Act had a lot to commend it, you now
equally robustly tell us today that you must scrap its central provisions.'
Unit fines were introduced under the 1991 Criminal Justice Act, the main
thrust of which was to encourage more imaginative penalties and avoid the
unnecessary use of custody. Mr Clarke, announcing a number of changes to the
act yesterday, adopted a different emphasis  - the need to tighten the
criminal law to give courts more powers to deal with offenders.
Other changes will include relaxing restrictions on taking previous records
into account, tightening the granting of bail, and increasing the maximum
penalty for causing death by dangerous driving from five to ten years.
The decision to change the act so soon will dismay penal reform
organisations and many criminal justice professionals. Only this week, the
National Association of Probation Officers urged the government to consult
widely before repealing any part of the act.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Britons 'not playing cricket' in Danish Maastricht campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and HILARY BARNES

<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE intervention of British politicians and newspapers in Denmark's
Maastricht referendum campaign is both unwelcome and unfair, Mr Niels Helveg
Petersen, the Danish foreign minister, said yesterday.
'I simply believe we should be left to fight our own campaign,' he said
yesterday. 'We do not interfere in the British campaign (on Maastricht). Let
the British fight their own battles in Britain and not here.'
Mr Helveg Petersen was echoing a growing sense of irritation in Denmark
about the role of outsiders in the referendum to be held next Tuesday.
Speaking a day after Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative cabinet minister,
and Mr Giles Radice, the Labour MP, traded insults in Copenhagen, the
foreign minister criticised the Sunday Times newspaper for what he said were
deliberate attempts to encourage a No vote. 'To use the British expression,
it is not cricket,' he said.
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Helveg Petersen's predecessor, also expressed
irritation over anti-Maastricht newspaper advertisments paid for by Sir
James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier. Mr Ellemann-Jensen said these
had wrongly accused him of stopping Mr Willy De Clercq, the former Belgian
minister, from coming to Denmark for a debate.
In an interview with the FT, he took a more relaxed view of British
visitors, saying Danes were likely to react to Lord Tebbit by voting against
him. 'The more the better,' he declared. 'I'm just sorry Lady Thatcher
doesn't show up. I would have paid her to come. That would really have
boosted the Yes campaign.'
Britons have not been alone in irritating the Danes. Earlier this month, Mr
Martin Bangemann, the European Community industry commissioner, enraged
treaty supporters by saying Maastricht could become the vehicle for a
European federation, a central concern among Danish voters.
Mr Helveg Petersen denied that Copenhagen had ordered EC commissioners to
desist from such public statements before Tuesday's vote, which the
government hopes will overturn the rejection of Maastricht in last June's
referendum.

THREATS of summer disruption to the public services grew yesterday as the
Fire Brigades Union conference voted unanimously to organise strike ballots
and the National Union of Teachers voted to boycott national curriculum
tests.
The most serious immediate danger to the government comes from the FBU,
whose general secretary, Mr Ken Cameron, warned the government: 'Take us on,
and you take us on at your peril.'
The firefighters' union wants to protect a 15-year-old formula that links
pay rises for its members to increases awarded to the top 25 per cent of
manual workers. The union's leaders argue that the formula will be scrapped
because of the government's 1.5 per cent pay limit, although ministers and
local government employers insist that nothing can be determined about
firefighters' pay until November, when their negotiations are due.
The NUT's boycott vote, by a majority of 96 per cent of those who voted, and
67.3 per cent of the total relevant membership, meant that the three biggest
teachers' unions will all boycott the tests, in effect destroying any chance
that they can produce meaningful results.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, 'deeply regretted' the decision.
The 1.5 per cent public sector pay policy may bring more trouble for the
government in other areas. Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries,
is due to publish a report on police pay next month and its recommendations
may prompt unrest in the police force if it threatens to alter the formula,
which has led to enormous increases for the police pay bill in recent years.
Other groups in the public services, notably ambulance workers, nurses,
civil servants and local-government staff, threaten disruption against the
government's planned cuts in services, privatisation of services and the
contracting-out of work to private companies.
The firefighters' union is joining ambulance and health workers in
demonstrations on May 26.
However, a tactical disagreement between the teachers' unions provides a ray
of hope for the government over testing. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general
secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women
Teachers, said: 'I urge all those unions implementing the boycott to be very
clear and correct about their objective.'
He said that comments from the NUT suggested the dispute was 'more concerned
with the educational, philosophical and political aspects of testing, which
cannot form the basis of a legitimate trade dispute'.
The NAS/UWT has beaten legal challenges by presenting its boycott as a
dispute solely over workloads.

<TEXT>
Marlboro's declining popularity has certainly smoked out some worries about
brand valuation at GrandMet. Due to the appreciation of the dollar, brands
in its balance sheet increased by Pounds 416m to Pounds 2.9bn in the first
half, a level equivalent to 76 per cent of net assets. Such treatment is a
long-established habit at GrandMet. It goes back to the awesome difficulty
of accounting for goodwill in food and drink company acquisitions. Brand
accounting is a way of putting such goodwill on the balance sheet without
having to depreciate it. But the brand valuation then easily becomes a
function of how much the acquirer has paid rather than its intrinsic worth.
GrandMet stresses the careful computation of margin, volume and cash-flow
which is factored into its brand valuations. Quite so, but the result still
basically reflects the management's own view and it is striking that none of
its brands has ever been down-graded. Indeed, to do so openly would risk
trouble. Consumers would scarcely flock to buy a product whose value to its
owners was diminishing. It is rather glib for the company to argue that the
flagging Green Giant can still be valued at Dollars 392m and Pearle at
Dollars 99m because it has resisted the temptation to revalue them upwards
in the past.
One way of maintaining a brand's value is to invest in it. GrandMet has been
doing plenty of that, for example with Haagen-Dazs ice cream in Europe. But
the company generated virtually no cash in the first half and needs to
reduce its Pounds 3.2bn debt. Capital spending is tailing off and the
marketing spend is flat, albeit at a high level. That, coupled with more
efficient use of working capital, may yield some cash. Whether the brands
will still be worth as much is anybody's guess.

Land Securities' latest fund-raising exercise resembles an old granny
withdrawing a little money from the bank to see if she can find a bargain in
the sales. The company's characteristic caution ensured it did not borrow
more than Pounds 140m in one lump. A rights issue may have seemed the most
obvious route but equity finance would have been rather dear. By issuing a
convertible bond, Land will be able to use money costing 7 per cent to buy
properties yielding 9 per cent. Even if it cannot find suitable properties
immediately, it will not hurt much to hold the money on deposit.
When the UK's biggest property company gears up to expand, it may well be a
bullish sign for the market as a whole. But Land has raised such dribbles of
money several times before. This latest move only pushes gearing up seven
percentage points to 66 per cent. Land's prudence has been appreciated in
recession and its rewards shone through again yesterday as it was strong
enough to lift the dividend by 5 per cent. But without greater aggression as
the recovery takes hold, its appeal will wane. Indeed, the process may
already have begun. Land's shares have risen 55 per cent since sterling's
devaluation. That, though, represents an underperformance of about 10 per
cent against the sector.

The European authorities are evidently gambling that the Iberian
devaluations will remain a parochial affair. Pressure on the Spanish
currency has been brewing for some time. A devaluation of 8 per cent may
allow short-term interest rates to fall to a level consistent with lower
unemployment and an end to the alarming slide in industrial production.
If so, Spain's third devaluation since last autumn could be dismissed as
another example of the weaker brethren falling by the wayside - an event of
little implication for the lucky survivors in the inner circle. Spain would
have had a surer chance of cutting rates significantly if its devaluation
had been 10 per cent, more so still if it had left the system altogether.
All of which shows how difficult the task of European currency management
remains.
The increasing threat to the ERM is that those who have devalued and cut
their interest rates will enjoy a stronger recovery and a quicker reduction
in unemployment. France, for example, must hope that Spain has not won too
much edge. It not only faces a loss of export competitiveness after
yesterday; its monetary policy is still dependent on the Bundesbank which is
back to blowing cold on interest rate cuts. If the French recession deepens
as a result, it may reject the pain. Denmark's voters have a chance to do so
in next week's referendum. If they take it, the centre may not hold.

Oh, to have had a bug on the wall when the Treasury mandarins heard about
BT's pension deficit. Some Pounds 500m of the deterioration in the fund has
come about directly as a result of the Budget advance corporation tax
changes. A similar amount fell victim to over-optimistic assumptions about
dividend growth in 1992 - perhaps an excusable error given the chancellor's
persistent visions of economic green shoots. To compensate, BT is pumping
Pounds 1.1bn of cash into the pension scheme just when the government is
trying to unload around Pounds 5bn worth of the company's shares.
BT did not have to replace the whole deficit at once, but there were obvious
reasons for doing so. Since the company can afford to cough up, it makes
sense to get the cash working tax-free as soon as possible. The board is
understandably keen to avoid the accusation that it has raided the pension
fund to pay for its redundancy programme. Paying now also puts off the
awkward day when BT clears its debts and starts piling up cash, thus
provoking serious questions about what should happen to its money.
The heavy redundancy programme makes BT a special case, but the dramatic
swing in the pension fund carries a wider message. If actuaries are sensibly
assuming that companies will not increase dividends to compensate for ACT
changes, and if 1992 was worse than generally anticipated, some company
pension holidays are about to come to an abrupt halt. Most companies will
have to make up the difference steadily - further limiting their ability to
increase cash dividend payments. By contrast, BT's financial strength,
phenomenal cash generation and 8.3 per cent dividend increase only underline
that it can afford to do what most others can not.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Government vows to tackle crime: Plan to raise retirement
age for women from 60 to 65 is delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT attempted yesterday to respond to turmoil in the Tory ranks
with a programme for the year ahead that stresses what Cabinet ministers see
as populist measures to tackle crime and cut regulations.
The politically controversial plan to raise the state retirement age for
women from 60 to 65 has been dropped from next year's legislative programme.
But Cabinet gave the go ahead to three Home Office bills - on Sunday
trading, tougher penalties for criminals, and restructuring the police
service.
Mr John Major will today try to restore an impression of stable government
after the serious buffeting of the last week following disastrous
by-election and local election results.
In spite of government 'U-turns' this week on schools testing and yesterday
on the unit fines system, the prime minister will seek to assure party
activists at the Scottish Tory party conference that he is determined to
carry through the policies to which Tories are pledged.
Mr Major will claim that a commitment to combat crime is an enduring
strength of the Conservative party and will promise all policies will be
geared towards a sustainable economic recovery.
The prime minister's office rebuffed suggestions the government had slimmed
down its legislative plans in the face of growing dissent within Tory ranks.
It promised, 'lots of red meat'.
Adding to government's difficulties was the death yesterday of Mr Robert
Adley, Tory MP for Christchurch, cutting the party's majority to 18. The
swing Liberal Democrats need to over turn his 23,000 majority is less than
the party achieved in last week's Newbury by-election.
Between 15 to 20 bills are expected for the Parliamentary session beginning
in November. Besides the bill on equalising male and female state retirement
ages, other casualties include Post Office privatisation and the bill on
banking supervision promised after the collapse of the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, is not now expected to publish a
pensions White Paper until the autumn. Changes would not take affect anyway
until well into the next century.
Other measures agreed for next year include a de-regulation bill, drawn up
by the Department of Trade and Industry but including the deregulation of
London buses and other transport measures.
The Foreign Office has won space for a bill to put the overseas security
service MI6 on a statutory basis. But the government has yet to decide on
whether to increase the accountability of MI6 and its domestic counterpart
MI5 to Parliament.
A decision is also still due on the contents of a bill expected imposed
restrictions on the media's use of bugging and telephoto lenses.

The White House works in mysterious ways. Hence, when tiny Bryn Parry
Studios in Downton, Wiltshire, received an urgent overseas order earlier
this week, they sensed the handiwork of Socks, America's First Cat.
Socks's owner had been let down by a US supplier and the English studio was
asked to stage a last minute rescue by supplying 22 picture frames for a
presidential presentation. Although the SOS arrived after the close of
business on Monday, the frames were winging their way to Washington by
Tuesday afternoon.
The only mystery is why the White House insisted on having plain designs
instead of the frames surrounded by cartoons of cats, for which the company
is noted.

It's a funny old world when British Coal closes one loss-making pit and
finds that it has to start importing coal from an overseas loss-making pit.
But this is what seems in danger of happening as a result of last week's
closure of Easington colliery in County Durham.
It sounds like British Coal will be forced to turn to overseas competitors
so that it can honour one of its most hallowed traditions - provision of
'concessionary' coal to miners, pensioners and their widows. Although
primarily a power station supplier, Easington also produced about 90,000
tonnes a year of house coal, much of which was earmarked for the 16,000
users of its 'concessionary' coal.
Fortunately for British Coal, Easington was declared a smokeless zone last
month. But British Coal admits that it is making alternative arrangements
for the minority who are still permitted to burn the black stuff.
Observer hears that the miners of Poland are being asked to to fill the
unexpected order.

Who struck Francois Mitterrand as having 'the eyes of Stalin and the voice
of Marilyn Monroe'?
As an additional clue, the same person was eulogised by UK employment
minister Michael Forsyth at yesterday's Scottish Tory conference as
inspiring him by 'her determination to spread ownership, choice and
opportunity to all'.
The answer, of course, is Lady Thatcher.
Mitterrand's comment is recorded in the diary just published in France by
his erstwhile constant attendant, Jacques Attali of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.
Called Verbatim and covering the six years between Mitterrand's election in
1981 and the Socialist party's 1986 general election defeat, it is the 17th
book that the 49-year- old Attali has found time to produce in his energetic
career. What's more, it will be followed by a second volume when the French
president leaves office in 1995.
The 960 pages of text already published contain many other quotable quotes
from international leaders, some worthy of being inscribed in marble.
Here's another on the Iron Lady delivered by then Italian premier Giulio
Andreotti after she'd been telling fellow EC leaders that she knew all about
small businesses because she herself had once worked in a three-person firm.
'What happened to the other two?', Andreotti whispered. 'No doubt they died
of work-related illnesses.'

Who says that business tycoons can't also excel in the arts? Certainly not
the enthusiastic audience which crowded into New York's Lincoln Center to
hear Sony's president and chief executive Norio Ohga conduct the
Metropolitan Opera Orchestra.
Besides being a sell-out at prices of Dollars 50-Dollars 100, his concert
attracted such show-business stars as Barbra Streisand, Dolly Parton, Billy
Joel and Tony Bennett. Moreover, not content simply with Ohga's
interpretations of the Die Fledermaus overture and two symphonies  -
Schubert's Unfinished and Beethoven's Seventh  - the listeners loudly
demanded an encore.
He gave them Sousa's The Stars and Stripes Forever, explaining in Japanese
later: 'I wanted to show the United States should be strong.'
On the other hand, the concert did have several unusual features. For one
thing, Ohga had paid out Dollars 100,000-plus to rent the 70-strong
orchestra, of whom about 40 were freelance players as distinct from regular
members.
For a second, the fact that the audience applauded between the movements of
the symphonies suggested that most of them were not regular concert-goers.
For a third, Streisand, Parton, Joel and Bennett have all recorded for
labels owned by Sony.
Then again, too, there was the strictly anonymous comment made afterwards by
one of the orchestra: 'He made believe he conducted, and we made believe we
watched.'

FT  14 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Realignment in Iberia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REALIGNMENTS by Spain and Portugal on the day that the Banque de France
made its sixth reduction in interest rates since election of the new
government confirms the emergence, since last September, of two sharply
delineated monetary tiers in the European Community. The Maastricht treaty
had to be obscure on this point. Markets have been less bashful. Yet being
in the second tier need not be disastrous. The good reason for bewailing
this lowly status is fear that the opportunity will be wasted. Should it not
be, however, those in the second tier will make life for those in the first
tier more uncomfortable than it already is. A two-tier EC will be full of
contention.
It would be wrong to blame these realignments on the forthcoming Danish
referendum. A more plausible explanation is the after-shock of the first
one. But even that earthquake revealed Europe's structural flaws more than
it caused them. By undermining the credibility of the move to economic and
monetary union, the Danes forced people to look at the economic
fundamentals.
What they then found has been graphically described by the staff of the
International Monetary Fund: 'Actual achievements in convergence among ERM
countries  - although significant  - were neither durable nor deep enough to
justify assuming complete fixity of exchange rates. Losses of
competitiveness, large fiscal deficits not yet under control, weaknesses in
financial sectors, sharp cyclical differences, and divergent mixes of
monetary and fiscal policy across counties (in the wake of German
unification) were each vulnerable elements.'
Political costs
'Vulnerable elements' imply vulnerable countries, with Spain in that
category. A country which needed relatively high interest rates, because its
inflation had not converged on the best European levels, long had one of the
strongest currencies in the system for precisely that reason. The peseta's
strength was an illusion that depended on the assumption that realignments
were in the past. Once events had destroyed that assumption, markets
challenged the strength of the peseta, which was realigned by a cumulative
total of 11 per cent in September and November of last year. Now it has been
realigned by another 8 per cent, the result being a total devaluation of 20
per cent.
Politically, this latest depreciation seems certain to damage the
re-election campaign of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, who has carried fidelity to the
ERM and the Maastricht treaty before him like a standard. The government has
been caught out in what electors may judge a lie. The damage would be still
greater if this realignment were not to forestall early pressure for
another. The plight of Portugal's government is less serious, because its
government can blame this second devaluation of the escudo on its bigger
neighbour, just as Ireland blamed the UK.
Conflicts sharpened
Economically, with inflation down to an annual rate of 4.6 per cent, Spain
in deepening recession and today's report on employment  - leaked yesterday
by the finance minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga  - showing the number of
unemployed up 253,000 in the first quarter of 1993, to 21.7 per cent of the
labour force, short-term interest rates have to fall. Overnight interest
rates at 16 1/2 per cent and three-month interbank rates only a little lower
are unsustainable. If the depreciation does allow interest rates to fall
sharply, however, and Spanish firms take advantage of the devaluation,
without conceding higher wages, the chances of a non-inflationary recovery
look good.
While beneficial for Spain, that development would sharpen conflicts in
Europe. Once again, a recession-bound France is faced with a significant
loss of competitiveness against an important European trading partner.
The conclusion of the European Community's analysis of the ERM has been that
it needs to be managed better. That is unquestionably true. Operation of the
system must avoid repeated damage to the reputation of governments, along
with enrichment of speculators at the expense of taxpayers. But more
fundamental changes will be needed if attempts to restore monetary order and
political harmony to Europe are to succeed.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Mr Clinton and China
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN WASHINGTON this month, the annual dance between president and Congress is
under way. What conditions will Mr Clinton attach to China's most-favoured
nation trading status? Will they be enough for Congress? This domestic,
repetitive argument hardly seems a sound basis for formulating the policy of
the largest economic power towards a country that may aspire to that
position, some think by the end of the decade.
China has changed. It is still governed by a repressive, totalitarian regime
which showed in 1989 that it was determined to retain power at all costs.
But its growth is quickly making it an economic and a regional power.
Western and Asian countries, which are pouring investment into it, already
have a big economic stake. Only yesterday, Singapore agreed to develop a
Dollars 20bn town in China modelled upon itself. Western companies know that
if they do not invest and trade with China, they risk locking themselves out
of the world's most profitable and dynamic region and so endangering growth
and jobs in the west.
Policy towards China needs to take these economic factors into account. The
need is for greater subtlety rather than an annual, self-satisfying decision
on how much to bash China over human rights.
Since a Russian-style end to Communist party rule seems unlikely, greater
freedom is likely to come slowly, whatever the west does. That the
transition takes place in reasonable stability is in everybody's interest,
given the dangers implicit in political turmoil in a country of 1.2bn
people. Economic reforms, under way for 14 years, offer the best hope of a
more pluralistic society.
Nannyish conditions
The freedom to make economic choices should lead in time to greater freedom
of expression and a general desire for greater political choice. The
thousands of contacts between foreign and Chinese business people are the
most important means of opening China to a wider range of ideas. For the US
to seek to stifle such relationships by attaching nannyish conditions to MFN
would be clumsy and counter-productive. It would hit precisely those who are
likely to change China for the better, and would probably be ineffective in
putting pressure on its leaders.
Mr Clinton has an opportunity to forge a new policy. He has so far been
cautious, pointing out the large US contribution to the revitalisation of
the Chinese economy, and asserting the right of the US to expect progress on
human rights and democracy. His officials say he will impose as yet
unspecified conditions on China's MFN status in June. They say that with
China no longer the balancing factor between two superpowers, the US can
afford to be less reticent on issues such as human rights.
Bouts of hectoring
In setting out his line, Mr Clinton should ensure that he is indeed seen to
have a China policy. A clearly enunciated, firm approach, sensitive to
congressional and business concerns, should render unnecessary the annual
MFN squabble. This should include a clear statement of the US interest in a
growing, stable China. Mr Clinton, mindful of the China's Dollars 18bn trade
surplus with the US last year, should make clear that trade must be on a
level playing field. The US presidency has unique leverage with Beijing, and
should engage in firm but private dialogue on human rights, arms sales and
China's participation in world affairs as a permanent member of the UN
Security Council. This is the way to ensure that the US builds on its
central role in east Asian affairs, with a strong part in maintaining
regional security.
Since the immediate discussion seems bound to end with the attachment of new
conditions to MFN, it is to be hoped that they will be phrased in general
terms. This does not preclude the separate application of pressure on
specific human rights issues such as prison labour, political detainees and
the rights of Tibetans. Experience shows that pressure on particular issues
produces small but significant dividends. But the most important point is
that in pursuing this crucial strategic relationship, the US needs to strike
a strategic tempo, rather than indulging in annual bouts of hectoring.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Personal View: Recovery crafted with co-operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The longest recession in the UK in more than half a century is officially
over, according to government figures. But there is much more to be done if
the UK is to restore its manufacturing base, reduce unemployment and sustain
recovery.
The key to continued growth is a partnership of government, banks and
businesses. No single group or organisation can achieve alone even a small
part of what can be achieved by these parties together.
For too long we have been caught up in a sterile slanging match about who is
to blame for the problems of smaller companies. With corporate gearing high
by UK standards and profitability likely to remain weak, pressure on company
finances will continue. Smaller companies, denied access to the capital
markets, will be especially vulnerable.
There are three key areas where the partnership of government, banks and
businesses can help: debt, equity and cash-flow.
Debt: In general, businesses should be looking to move away from
over-dependence on short-term financing in order to lessen their
vulnerability to rising and high interest rates.
The improvements to the loan guarantee scheme announced in the Budget were
welcome. Increases in the loan limit and guaranteed amount and the cut in
premiums should help support economic recovery and create new jobs. But
these are only the first step.
Introduction of a government loan support scheme, for example, would enable
banks to reduce the rate charged on medium and long-term loans to 1 per cent
over base. Essentially, this would act as a subsidy to industry and could be
restricted to manufacturing with its need for longer-term capital
investment. A similar scheme already operates in Germany. Even if a quarter
of bank loans to manufacturing companies were subsidised, it would cost the
Treasury only about Pounds 67m a year. Banks in turn must be prepared to
lengthen the maturity of debt.
Equity: While recognising the government's difficult fiscal position, I
think there are a number of ways it could encourage the retention and
enlargement of companies' equity bases.
It was gratifying to see the importance of the entrepreneur's investment
role recognised in the Budget, with the introduction of capital gains tax
relief to those who sell one business and invest the proceeds in another. A
manufacturing support scheme, to replace the business expansion scheme,
which is phased out at the end of the year, would further encourage
longer-term equity investment by individuals. Tax incentives could also be
used to encourage businesses to retain surplus profits. At the moment, every
incentive is the other way.
Banks can also support equity investment. Through equity options, for
instance, we can help the profitable, well-managed but slower growing
company which does not need additional permanent equity but lacks loan
collateral.
Similarly, where well-managed companies, with good prospects, are
overburdened with debt, we should consider using debt/equity swaps at an
earlier stage, rather than as a last resort.
Midland has been at the forefront of developing equity investment
facilities. Midland Growth Capital, which provides equity of between Pounds
50,000 and Pounds 750,000 for established customers, is one of the few
national institutions to offer long-term equity finance of less than Pounds
250,000. Equity is an essential component of a sound balance sheet and
businesses must accept this, even if it means allowing in outside investors.
Cash-flow is also fundamental to business survival. Improved debt control,
through increased use of factoring and invoice discounting, is something for
both the banks and companies to consider.
A statutory right to interest on overdue debts - common in some European
countries - would significantly improve the cash-flow of many companies. But
financial means alone will not ensure a company's future. Effective
management calls for the production of accurate, prompt financial
information. Adequate training is also vital.
Recovery may at last be under way, but its pace looks set to be slow and
fragile. Government must, therefore, join with banks and businesses to
ensure we do not repeat the experience of the last decade, when the number
of failures following the 1979-81 recession did not peak until 1985.
Implementing any one of the proposals outlined here could help avoid a
similar trend. Implementing them all, as part of a concerted tripartite
effort, would have a real impact.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Prey to scandals they deserve: A spate of resignations and
inquiries is rocking Germany's political establishment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There seems to be no stopping the blood-letting in the German body politic.
Another minister resigned yesterday, not a very important one, but still
another scalp for the scandal-mongers. Ms Heidi Pfarr, the Social Democrat
minister for women's affairs in the state government of Hesse, quit because
she had claimed DM60,000 (Pounds 24,400) from the state coffers to pay for
removal costs and redecoration of her home when she took up her post.
Along with most of the other scandals plaguing the political establishment,
it scarcely ranks as a serious crime. It is not even clear it was against
the rules. But in the current supercharged atmosphere, it was enough of an
embarrassment to force her resignation.
Every leading political party has now been hit by similar scandals with
resounding consequences. This week, Mr Max Streibl, the Bavarian premier
from the conservative Christian Social Union, has agreed to step down before
the end of the summer. He was accused of taking free holidays to Kenya and
Brazil from a businessman friend.
Last week Mr Gunther Krause, the transport minister, was obliged to resign
by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, his party leader in the Christian Democratic
Union. His misdeeds included claiming social security subsidies for
employing a maid at his east German home.
Two days before, Mr Bjorn Engholm, the respected leader of the opposition
Social Democrats, stepped down after admitting that he misled a
parliamentary inquiry in 1987. Ironically, the inquiry was into a dirty
tricks campaign against him, but he lied about the moment when he first
heard of it. The implication was that he was no longer the innocent victim,
but rather a cynical politician who manipulated the media. It destroyed his
reputation as a scrupulous Mr Clean.
First to go this year, almost as the new year was ushered in, was Mr Jurgen
Mollemann, the economics minister and candidate for leadership of the Free
Democrats in the ruling coalition. He quit after denying, and then
admitting, that he wrote a letter to the country's leading supermarket
chains, promoting a plastic security device for supermarket trolleys
manufactured by a cousin of his wife's.
There are currently more than 20 parliamentary inquiries under way into
political scandals. The mayor of Bremen is accused of getting his
electricity at half price from the city power station. The premier of Hesse
is charged with obtaining designer furniture for his official residence. The
premier of the Saarland (the irrepressible Mr Oskar Lafontaine) is accused
of consorting with members of the underworld.
The rash of petty speculation seems scarcely explicable in a country with
such a normally ponderous press. Nor does the apparent loss of nerve by the
politicians, traditionally a thick-skinned bunch. As for the public, it
responds by demonstrating an ever-declining respect for the political
establishment.
Just a year before Germany faces no fewer than 19 separate polls at local
authority, state, federal and European level - not to mention the election
of a new federal president - it is a disturbing state of affairs. There is a
growing tendency of voters to stay at home - 39 per cent said they would not
vote, in a recent opinion poll. Others are drifting to the fringes,
represented by the Greens and the far-right-wing Republicans.
And yet it is precisely that coincidence of elections which has been a
contributory factor in the sudden spate of resignations. The parties are
cleaning out their stables in a desperate effort to prepare themselves for
the fray.
That is not all. It is the very awareness of a growing contempt for the
political establishment, known as Politikverdrossenheit, that has inspired
the politicians to try to clean up their act.
A further factor is the upsurge in media competition, particularly in the
heavyweight field of political weekly magazines trying to muscle in on the
market traditionally dominated by Der Spiegel. That is compounded by a rash
of new television stations. All are seeking to outdo one another in
political scoops.
Finally, there is a fundamental problem which all the political parties
face, of coming to terms with the transformed world both within Germany, and
outside it. They have yet to adapt to the new post-unification Germany,
facing fundamental structural problems as well as recession. They lack any
coherent security policy to deal with the post-cold war external
environment. The result is a sense of drift in the government and the
opposition.
When Mr Engholm addressed the press conference in Bonn at which he announced
his resignation, he was asked if his move would not aggravate the current
malaise. He said he hoped it would have the opposite effect. 'I hope most
people will draw the conclusion that people in politics are ready to take
responsibility for their actions.'
Few outside observers believe him. He was one of the few respected men in
the political leadership, and his departure certainly leaves his party in
embarrassing disarray. The latest opinion polls, to be published today, will
show Mr Kohl's CDU taking a narrow lead - in spite of the recession, strikes
in east Germany, and the chancellor's low public standing.
According to a close confidant of the former SPD leader, Mr Engholm quit for
three reasons. First, he underestimated the determination of the press to
expose his own political scandal, and also misjudged the importance of his
own mistake. Second, he was made brutally aware of the lack of solidarity
among his immediate colleagues in the SPD leadership.
The third, and perhaps the most fundamental reason, was that he was daunted
by the difficulty of making his fellow Social Democrats face up to the
policy changes necessary to make them 'electable' in a unified Germany. He
faced a tremendous battle to push through a compromise policy on controlling
the flow of asylum seekers - the single most explosive issue in western
Germany. He failed to win a second struggle to persuade the party to adopt a
new policy allowing German troops to participate in international
peace-keeping operations. He was depressed and exhausted by the effort.
Mr Engholm felt betrayed by his party colleagues. As in the other
resignations there was a strong suspicion that fellow party members had
fuelled, and perhaps initiated, the scandals.
Mr Mollemann was an embarrassment as a candidate for FDP party leader. He
was a lightweight, and the party establishment had decided they wanted Mr
Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, instead. So Mr Mollemann had to go.
Mr Streibl is in a similar position. With him as Bavarian premier, the CSU
would be in serious danger of losing its absolute majority in next year's
state elections. For a brief moment, Mr Theo Waigel, the easy-going federal
finance minister in Bonn, thought he would replace him. It now looks far
more likely that Mr Edmund Stoiber, the hard-line Bavarian interior
minister, will step in instead.
'The Bavarians have had enough of nice guys, like Streibl and Waigel,'
according to one close observer. 'They are looking for a tough guy more in
the image of Franz-Josef Strauss to stand up to both Bonn and the
Republicans.'
Messrs Mollemann, Streibl and Krause were all an embarrassment to their
parties. Getting rid of them may well help them in the polls. Mr Engholm was
not a liability. He was a positive bonus for the SPD. Now the opposition
faces a prolonged period of bickering over the leadership which is likely to
leave it electorally lame.
Whether the whole political establishment can recover quickly from the
current period of contempt is also questionable. 'If people had the
impression that the political establishment was dealing with the important
problems in a competent manner, they would not pay attention to petty
scandals,' according to Mr Matthias Jung, of the Wahlen opinion research
institute.
Or as one leading political correspondent put it: 'The quality of these
scandals reflects the quality of German politics. The politicians get the
scandals they deserve.'

<TEXT>
Sir, The current controversy over compact disc pricing in the UK versus the
US is not the only pricing issue for which we should feel some vexation.
Returning last week from Tampa, Florida, with a local paper shows me that
tyres for my car quoted in the UK at a discount rate of Pounds 120 each are
readily available at an advertised rate of Dollars 86.95, excluding tax, in
both cases. On the face of it less than half UK cost. A domestic washing
machine compares approximately at the same numerical price in sterling as in
US dollars.
My customers in the US are satisfied that the FOB (freight on board) UK
prices for electronic component hardware leaving this factory are the same
to UK customers. Meanwhile we pay through the nose for essential items such
as tyres and domestic appliances, not to mention cars, made in Europe if not
UK.
Who's kidding who?

FT  14 MAY 93 / In a squeeze over tax: The impact of a transatlantic dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign governments, businesses and tax lawyers are waiting anxiously for a
decision from the US Supreme Court that could have far-reaching consequences
for the way in which multinational companies are taxed. It could possibly
trigger a transatlantic tax war.
The court is expected to announce on Monday whether it will hear the case of
Barclays Bank International versus the Franchise Tax Board of California, an
appeal against the state's system for assessing tax on companies that do
business within its borders.
Yesterday, however, the UK raised the stakes with the pre-emptive
announcement of retaliation if the issue is not resolved by the end of this
year. The proposed action, announced yesterday in the Commons by the
chancellor, would eliminate the partial refund of corporation tax that US
companies now receive from the Inland Revenue on dividends paid by UK
subsidiaries to the US parent. This would, in effect, increase their tax
rate from 28 to 33 per cent and could cost US businesses, such as banks, oil
companies and chemicals concerns, an estimated Pounds 250m a year.
Barclays' 10-year suit involves both a great deal of money  - as much as
Dollars 4bn for the virtually bankrupt state of California  - and a
substantial point of principle: a potential challenge to the web of
bilateral agreements which allows companies to conduct their business in
different countries without suffering beggar-thy-neighbour taxation on each
side of the border.
One foundation of most of these agreements is the arm's length principle. In
determining how much of a multinational company's profits should be assessed
in each country, tax inspectors require the group to record the prices at
which goods and services are transferred between subsidiaries in different
countries as though they were being sold to independent customers.
These transfer pricing calculations are easy enough for basic commodities
such as oil, or even for more complex components for which a market price
can be established. They can be much harder in other cases, such as for the
calculation of royalties on a unique soft contact lens technology, to cite a
case the US Internal Revenue Service lost to the Bausch and Lomb optical
group.
Many US politicians and tax collectors believe there are wholesale abuses of
the system by foreign companies which manipulate their transfer prices to
shift taxable income out of the US and overseas, either to their home
country or to some fiscal haven with a lower corporate tax rate.
As a result, some US tax authorities favour a simpler formula for estimating
how much of a group's profit should be taxed in each state or country. They
take the company's overall profits and divide them by the percentage of its
payroll, sales and property in their state.
The problem arises when California seeks to apply this approach not just to
the profits of a single company legally incorporated in the state, but also
to the profits of other companies in the same group which the state views as
a single business unit.
California occasionally used this unitary taxation method between the 1920s
and the 1970s. It provoked no complaints. From 1970 onwards, however, the
state began to apply the unitary method 'whenever related entities exhibited
a unitary business relationship', according to Mr Benjamin Miller of the
Franchise Tax Board, extending it to the worldwide operations of
multinationals.
The Supreme Court has seen no intrinsic problem in unitary taxation,
validating the method in its 1983 decision in a case brought by Container
Corporation against the Franchise Tax Board. But it has expressly reserved
judgment on its application to foreign-based businesses, where the method
faces a very specific challenge: Barclays argues that California's approach
is illegal because it interferes with the federal government's sole right
under the US constitution to regulate foreign commerce.
Past US administrations have agreed, filing briefs with the Supreme Court in
support of Barclays. The Clinton administration, however, has reversed this
position and filed no brief on Barclays' latest bid to have the case heard.
The White House's principal concern appears to have been the perilous
condition of California's finances. The state last year had to pay its
workers in IOUs after failing to agree a budget. This year, with the region
still in recession, it faces another Dollars 8.6bn shortfall, which must be
met by higher taxes or lower spending.
The Barclays case alone could cost California about Dollars 520m in tax and
interest to the British bank and to other companies in a similar position,
and Dollars 350m of taxes assessed but not yet collected.
Potentially far more serious is a closely related case brought by
Colgate-Palmolive, the US household and hygiene group, challenging the
inclusion of foreign subsidiaries in a unitary assessment. This involves
about Dollars 1.2bn in possible refunds and the loss of some Dollars 1.9bn
which the state still hopes to collect.
Ironically, most of the facets of unitary taxation that foreign companies
and governments find objectionable have been eliminated, following pressure
from the Reagan administration in the 1980s.
Since 1988, companies operating in California can now elect to be taxed on a
'water's edge' basis, which includes only their activities within the US in
the unitary assessment. However, they still complain about the cost of
preparing different accounts for California and about the fee they have to
pay for the 'water's edge' choice, which brings the state Dollars 30m a
year. Other states  - except Alaska, which applies unitary taxation to oil
companies  - have abandoned the unitary method.
The risk that some foreign governments see, however, is that they might rush
to reintroduce the system if the Supreme Court rules against Barclays.
'We are worried about opening the door,' said Mrs Christiane Scrivener, the
EC Commissioner for tax affairs, who was in Washington this week to lobby
against the unitary taxation method.
This concern may not be misplaced. Mr Miller of the California Franchise Tax
Board says he would still like to return to worldwide unitary assessments,
although he would settle for mandatory 'water's edge' reporting.
Some tax experts even worry that the Clinton administration's decision not
to back Barclays might be seen as a nod in the direction of abandoning the
traditional arm's length principle in favour of a formula approach.
Such a move still appears a distant prospect, but with the UK now embarked
on retaliation, a tax war that could unravel the complex network of
international tax treaties no longer seems impossible.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Louise Kehoe's article about Levi Strauss's decision to make a stand
for human rights may prove to be the first in a series ('Levi Strauss
rejects investment in China', May 4). The next challenge is to find a
corporate leader willing to take a public stand against corruption in
international business transactions.
This may happen quite soon given the rising tide of public outrage over
corruption - from Italy to Japan to Brazil to increasing numbers of
developing countries where the attainment of more open and honest government
is now a priority.
There is already consideration within some governments and some aid agencies
to request companies seeking to tender for big contracts to first agree to
abide by a monitorable set of anti-corruption standards.
What is needed is for companies to seek roles for themselves within
international co-operative efforts to raise levels of honesty and integrity
in business. Frank Vogl,

FT  14 MAY 93 / Letter: Audit fee figures not just simple averages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J DENNIS HENRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Andrew Jack, in his article on international accounting and auditing
(Accountancy Column, May 6), quoted an average of audit fees as a proportion
of sales as being 0.022 per cent in the UK, according to the Cifar report.
This average is only true for companies of a particular size; those with
Pounds 20m-Pounds 50m in sales. The median figure for small plcs, with less
than Pounds 5m in sales, is about 0.0056 per cent, while companies with more
than Pounds 1bn in sales have a median of only 0.00046 per cent.
The industry sector also has a big effect. Distribution companies can, for
example, have audit fees one third those of similar-sized engineering
companies.
I give the above figures as many may have compared their own percentage with
that given and found variations. As ever, the use of simple averages can be
misleading.

Whichever way it goes, the Danish referendum next Tuesday will leave
Britain's Conservatives where they are now: at each others' throats.
This thought will not disturb the sleep of many Danish voters. Their task is
to decide whether their own country should adhere to the Maastricht Treaty.
They are blessedly free of concern for the internal politics of the
governing party in another country. The presence of Lord Tebbit and other
Tory Europhobes on the streets of Copenhagen is an indicator of the strength
of feeling in Britain, not Denmark. The three or four avowedly
anti-Maastricht candidates who stood in last week's Newbury by-election were
obliterated, wiped off the map, consigned to the hall of comic fame with the
Monster Raving Loony 30 Year party. No wonder their like have fled across
the water to try their passion on a Nordic electorate.
They might as well have stayed at home. From what can be gathered at a
distance, the Tory irreconcilables are only slightly more welcome in Denmark
than would be, say, a gang of soccer hooligans straight out of Liverpool. We
should, however, be charitable to the Tebbit bovver boys. They add hilarity
to what might otherwise be suffocatingly dull proceedings.
In British political terms there are only two possible outcomes to Tuesday's
vote. Let us take the least likely first. A second Danish 'no' would stagger
Europe, but it would not restore peace to the British Conservative party, at
least not for long. The bill to ratify Maastricht would be withdrawn from
the House of Commons on the ground that the Danes had exercised a decisive
veto. Legally speaking, that would be correct.
The politics of such an upset would be more complicated. There might be a
short flurry of excitement, and some talk of Mr John Major's narrow escape,
but that would soon pass. Far from being off any hook, the prime minister
would stand amid the ruins of his European dream. Sooner or later France and
Germany would announce the construction of a European union without Denmark,
probably running parallel to but outside the edifice built on the Treaty of
Rome. This might be based on the core of the Schengen group - the Benelux
countries, plus France and Germany. It could soon attract up to 11 members
if Britain stayed in the game, or 10 if it did not. That stark choice - to
be or not to be one of the potential 11 - would rekindle the Conservative
civil war and keep it going for years.
Now try the opposite route. Reports from Copenhagen suggest that it is
likely that the Danes will vote 'yes' on Tuesday. In the short run that
could have an even more incendiary effect on the Conservatives. The third
reading of the British bill would be eased through the Commons on Thursday,
courtesy of Labour. The party of Mr John Smith, that unwavering defender of
the European Community, plans to demonstrate its clear-headed and courageous
adherence to European unity by abstaining. The effect will be to maximise
and expose the rebellion among Conservatives. The subsequent passage of the
bill through the upper house will doubtless be marked by fiery speeches from
Lord Tebbit and Lady Thatcher. Once signed by the Queen it will be
challenged in the high court on technical grounds.
That should keep the Conservatives quarrelling among themselves through the
summer, but the unlovely prospect does not end there. The second stage of
the process leading to European monetary union formally starts on January 1
1994. The move to a single currency comes later. The work due in 1994-95 is
merely preparatory to the real thing. It should be harmless, but if the
present mood persists, the slightest hint of Britain's return to the
exchange rate mechanism, or adherence to a European central bank, or
anything else of the sort would deepen and widen the split in the
Conservative party.
It is important to be clear about the nature of the schism. Among
back-benchers the hard-core Europhobes are as small in number as they are
loud in voice. They are counterbalanced by a rather larger but relatively
silent group of federalist Eurocentrics. These factions compete for
middle-of the road Tory opinion. The government's post-Maastricht strategy
is to win over all save the anti-European fanatics by stressing its role in
tabling British proposals for the next intergovernmental conference on
European union. That conference is due in 1996, shortly before or shortly
after the next general election.
Most of us have been too distracted by the general disarray in the
government to pay full attention to its argument. Yet even this week it has
been backed by a flurry of supportive words. On Monday the Conservative
Group for Europe published The Positive Europe by a Europhile MP, Mr Ian
Taylor. Mr Taylor, who has long served as parliamentary private secretary to
Mr William Waldegrave, is perhaps a trifle over-enthusiastic. 'We are
committed to the goal of economic and monetary union,' he writes, 'so let us
come up with a way of getting there rather than implying that the Maastricht
timetable will not work.' A further pamphlet of the 'John Major wuz right'
sort emerged yesterday, this time from the Society of Conservative Lawyers.
Its authors* stick closely to the government's line on the Maastricht
Treaty. 'If a pup has been sold to the Danish people,' they argue, 'it was
sold to them by the 'No' camp in the first Danish referendum.'
Mr Douglas Hurd has also been doing his best. The EC, the foreign secretary
told the Scottish Conservative party yesterday, 'is one of the foremost
political achievements of the 20th century.' Nevertheless it apparently
needs British guidance to be further improved, for Mr Hurd produced the
familiar list of government proposals: enlargement to a community of 16 in
1995 and 20 five years later; more inter-governmental agreements, with
different groups of countries assembling themselves for each deal; an
emphasis on subsidiarity; a more accountable commission. It was a stout
defence of Mr Major's treaty, unmarred by any indication of when Britain
might return to the exchange rate mechanism. It is the best that Downing
Street can do, but it might not be good enough to unite the Conservative
party.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Letter: Treasury plans for model of economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From A P HUDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Peter Marsh ('Treasury Economic Model may be run by US Group', April 6
and subsequent articles) has repeated the story that discussions took place
in January between the Treasury and the US consultancy DRI about the
possibility of the Treasury contracting out the supervision of its
computerised model of the UK economy.
This story is wholly misleading. The facts are as follows. We announced last
September that economic model building and development are among the
Treasury activities to be market tested. This process is still at an early
stage internally. No decision has yet been taken on whether model building
will be contracted out. No negotiations have taken place with other
organisations about contracting out model building.
Treasury officials frequently hold informal meetings with other forecasting
groups, which happened to include DRI in January, a part of our continuing
interest in techniques of forecasting. But these have not been concerned
with contracting out model building.
I hope this clears up the confusion which has arisen over this issue.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Letter: Whose choice in Sunday trading argument?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MICHAEL SCHLUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Allow me to take issue with your editorial on Sunday trading (May 7).
The Home Office study showed that total deregulation of Sunday trading would
probably, and eventually, save the average consumer 50p a week. Not to be
sneezed at. However, this would be achieved by accelerating the closure of
tens of thousands of small shops. (Small business managers cannot cope
constantly with a seven-day working week, nor afford to hire substitute
management for one day a week).
Hence retail spending is concentrated in fewer outlets, prices fall and jobs
go.
From the consumer's point of view, the advantages of Sunday trading are
extra choice of shopping time as well as lower prices in the long term. The
disadvantages are less choice of outlet and less proximity of outlet - the
consumer may often have to travel further for the small purchase if small
chops close.
For the disadvantaged consumer there is little benefit. Based on recent
Office of Population, Censuses and Surveys data, if local shops closed down,
those groups saying they would be 'inconvenienced a lot' include almost 40
per cent of those over 75, 50 per cent of lone parent households and 37 per
cent of those without cars.
One dimension of the Sunday trading debate is consumer choice. The issue is
which consumer and which choice.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Letter: Flawed procurement policy a threat to UK
shipbuilding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr PETER HILDITCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Jonathan Aitken, the defence procurement minister, argues that the
award of the contract for a helicopter carrier to VSEL rather than Swan
Hunter was made on 'our normal technical and value-for-money criteria' ('200
jobs threatened at Swan Hunter', May 12). Further analysis suggests that
competition was far from fair. It also indicates that divorcing defence
procurement decisions from broader industrial policy considerations is
likely to be disastrous.
VSEL has, since the early 1970s, held a monopoly of nuclear submarine
construction. It seems obvious that the company might use its monopoly
profits, especially those obtained with the huge Trident contract, to buy
back into the surface warship market. By contrast, Swan Hunter has had to
compete for all its recent naval orders. Moreover, the dearth of such orders
directly resulting from the excessive concentration on Trident must have
undermined its ability to offer competitive prices.
The result of the competitive process will be an extension of VSEL's nuclear
monopoly to large surface warships. The government should recognise that its
current procurement policies are flawed and are leading to a loss of
valuable capacity and skills which could be employed outside the defence
market.
Most experts believe that the world merchant shipbuilding market will expand
substantially from the mid-1990s. Swan Hunter should at the very least be
given the same level of government support, at present denied, as the
handful of remaining UK merchant shipbuilders already receive in order to
compete in the world market. This policy and more determined support for
other diversification measures and a more honest appraisal of so-called
value for money defence policies might go some way both to preserving some
competition and some capacity in UK shipbuilding.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Arts: Alexei Lubimov and Nathalie Stutzmann - Recitals at
the Wigmore Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY and MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nobody should think that 'fortepiano' is a specific term; it used to mean
the same thing as 'pianoforte', and nowadays suggests only that the
instrument in question is fairly antique. The Wigmore Hall's May brochure
billed Cyril Huve as playing an 1828 Pleyel piano last week (reviewed here
by Max Loppert), and Alexei Lubimov a 'fortepiano'  - but on Tuesday the
latter proved to be a sumptuous 1858 Broadwood.
Lubimov is an ancient-and-modern specialist from Moscow, allowed to make
western appearances only since 1987. That has been our loss: his programme
was a joy to hear. It was hardly possible to distinguish the special period
charms of the instrument from the genial musicianship of the pianist, though
Glinka's variations on a Bellini tune (from I Capuleti ed i Montecchi) were
surely enhanced by the twinkling sound.
In familiar Liszt and Chopin, Lubimov offered more imaginative faithfulness
than I have heard in some time, different in innumerable details from the
'standard' readings. But every time one thought, 'Now, there's something you
couldn't do on a modern grand]' it was also something that perhaps only
Lubimov would have thought of doing anyway. The sound never seemed
miniaturised: the third and fourth Chopin Ballades rose to glorious
climaxes, and the three members of the audience who left before the encores
missed a magnificent Barcarolle.
Perhaps Liszt's 'La Leggierezza' had a magical whisper that could never be
drawn from the Wigmore's new Bosendorfer, but even there Lubimov was
achieving pedal-effects of a rare, inspired order. (This Broadwood must have
been reckoned a miraculous instrument in its day.) What characterises
antique piano-sound is the relative audibility of the hammers against the
slighter, less carrying resonance of the strings; with a musician like
Lubimov, one was the more struck by his singing legato, expressive down to
the least breath.
It was somewhat shocking to realise that most so-called 'Chopin specialists'
in fact hew to a tried-and-true party line. Were there more pianists with
Lubimov's artful delicacy, sweetness and interpretative breadth, the party
line might wilt away altogether.
*****
This is a very special voice: low-lying, dark-toned, dense-textured, rich
but not heavy, round but not loose or slack-muscled. Even if the species
female contralto were not almost extinct  - as now seems to be the case
internationally  - its owner, a young Parisian still only in her 20s, would
probably have speeded her way through the ranks all the same. The reason is
her captivatingly individual quality of tone and timbre, and the capacity
she has shown for delivering fast-moving, highly ornate 18th-century vocal
writing with exciting virtuosity and ease.
Several recent Handel recordings, notably Erato's wonderful Amadigi and an
RCA set of Handel arias, have already cast Nathalie Stutzmann as their primo
uomo, to their greater glory; her first London recital, on Wednesday, was an
opportunity to savour this voice in different musical conditions, and in the
uniquely sympathetic acoustics and environment of the Wigmore Hall. The
voice survived the test handsomely  - it is a remarkable instrument  - but
the artistry was shown in a slightly less encouraging light.
It was a 'straight' song recital, not a 'live' display of the Baroque vocal
skills already demonstrated on record: Schubert and Schumann in the first
half, Faure and Debussy in the second. That was plainly an error of
judgment, for on this evidence Miss Stutzmann's singing of Lieder and
melodies is tethered at the advanced-student level  - cautious, apt to
favour slow tempos and solemn moods (and to make a meal of them), concerned
to produce nice sounds rather than to frame alert verbal statements.
Consonants were swallowed in almost every sentence  - surprisingly, this
proved no less true in her native tongue than in German  - and rhythms
allowed to go slack; impeccable legato was not a cherished aim. (The erratic
pianist, Catherine Collard, provided little counterbalance.) Individual
phrases may have made a pleasing impression, but the sum total was of
well-intended un-clarity and immaturity. Miss Stutzmann should be encouraged
to return here soon  - with a more suitable programme and a sharper artistic
focus underlying it.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Arts: New Visions, New Voices - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
May has become London's month for bold new opera ventures, or so the theory
runs, as both the Royal Opera and English National strive to prove that they
have the future health of the genre at heart. Another round of the Royal
Opera's Garden Venture is due in two weeks; ENO promises a package of its
10-minute 'Soundbites' next Monday and Tuesday at the Donmar Warehouse,
while 'New Visions, New Voices' has been organised under the auspices of the
Baylis Programme this week in the Royal College of Music's Britten Theatre.
Such a flurry of earnest activity continues to paper over the real problem
 -the absence of a regular London outlet for small-scale new opera by
established composers. It's all very well for the Garden Venture to pat
itself on the back for providing young composers with an opportunity to
attempt a theatre piece, but it blithely ignores the reality that the gap
between such gimcrack pieces and a fully fledged score for the opera house
remains unbridgeably vast. Far better for Covent Garden to devote those same
resources to a regular season of works that would be inappropriate in the
ROH itself, yet would properly complement the programme in the main house.
At least ENO now appears to have in place a career structure of sorts for
its composers; the collaboration with the Almeida Theatre for a summer
festival (with new works by Julian Grant and Kevin Volans this July) should
offer the serious chamber dimension, 'Soundbites' occupies the experimental
niche, while 'New Visions, New Voices' is aimed at the real beginners; the
four works mounted at the RCM were selected from the 100-plus submitted in
response to a public appeal for new talent last year.
Once again, however, sincere intentions seem to have blurred the clear focus
of the final product. The range of ability and ambition in the works chosen
for 'New Visions, New Voices' seemed impossibly wide. At one end of the
spectrum was Melissa's Maelstrom by the 16-year-old twins Dina and Rosabella
Gregory, showing a promising ear for word setting (in a style that rather
alarmingly combined elements of Michael Nyman and Lloyd Webber); at the
other was the slick The King Comm by Fabienne Audeoud, who has already
presented her own multi-media shows across Europe and has clearly acquired a
full complement of post-modern pretensions to go with them. Somewhere
between came Richard Chew's Still, to a text by James Yarker, which was both
confused in its period-hopping dramaturgy and uncertain in its musical
stance, and Tom Green and Todd McNeal's Inspector Otto and the Long-haired
Bicycle Maniac, an eco-parable which at least managed not to take itself too
seriously.
They all made, though, for an over-extended and depressingly routine
evening. Each work was at least 15 minutes too long, and the
self-congratulatory air of the whole enterprise seemed to have prohibited
any suggestion of self-criticism. The productions (two by David Sulkin, one
each by Stephen Langridge and Rebecca Meitlis) were solid enough, and the
casts of student singers from the RCM included some sterling performances,
especially from the mezzo Lilli Paasikivi and the tenor Michael Hart-Davis.
For those at least, one could be grateful.
*****
The National Theatre's 'Springboards' season, its showcase of studio work in
the Cottesloe, also finds room for a new chamber opera, presented in
collaboration with the Leicester Haymarket. Andrew Poppy's Baby Doll
transforms Tennessee Williams' screen play into a continuous 90-minute
piece; Fiona O'Neill takes the title role, Simon Masterston-Smith and John
Upperton play the husband Archie Lee and the seducer Silva respectively.
Poppy is a graduate, if that's the right word, of the very first Garden
Venture in 1989, which included his The Uranium Miners Radio Orchestra Play
Scenes from Salome's Revenge. What he has carried over from that experience,
apart perhaps from a need for shorter titles, is hard to discern; certainly
not a greater flexibility or purpose in his vocal writing, which flattens
every hint of humour or irony from Williams's lines, or a lighter touch with
his instrumentation, which clumps along in a fractured minimalist way. Baby
Doll, the opera, seems a thoroughly pointless exercise, which really made
one wonder whether all these new outlets for that notional reservoir of
untapped operatic potential are fostering any worthwhile talents whatsoever.
'New Visions, New Voices', sponsored by British Gas, at the Britten Theatre,
Royal College of Music; further performance tonight.
Baby Doll at the Cottesloe Theatre; further performances tomorrow and at the
Leicester Haymarket from May 18

The usual undemanding Friday night schedule. It's good news for voyeurs with
the return of Through the Keyhole (ITV, 7pm) in which the much caricatured
David Frost and the even more caricatured Loyd Grossman join forces to take
a prying camera into the homes of semi-celebrities, while nosy panellists
try and guess the name of the house owner. Also a return for Rides (BBC1,
9.30pm), the tribulations of an all-female minicab firm.
Am I alone in finding Have I Got News For You (BBC2, 10pm) unwatchable? The
desperate attempts of the regulars to find innuendo in every item; the
embarrassed silences of the guests; and the hysterical baying of the
audience make it a masterpiece of artificial pretension.
A surfeit of self-congratulation continues with Clive Anderson Talks Back
(C4, 10.30pm). The witty barrister makes sure he has the punchlines,
treating his guests as fall guys.
Anyone who failed to get a ticket for Leonard Cohen's Albert Hall concerts
this week can catch the lugubrious Canadian on Later with Jools Holland
(BBC2, 11.15pm).

FT  14 MAY 93 / Arts: Welcome showcase for British art - The Arts Council's
rehang at the Festival Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the good things to come out of Tony Banks's stint as cultural supremo
of the old Greater London Council, in the period of its last controversial
fling before abolition, was the liberating of the Royal Festival Hall. It
has proved a lasting legacy. From being an echoing desert, its vast foyer
was transformed at once into an agreeable and useful public space, a lively
yet easy social rendezvous, with its shops and bars and cafes, its free
concerts and exhibitions.
Not that the actual demonstration always lived up to the principle. The
eager populism of its instigators tended too much at first towards a hectic
and undifferentiated hubbub of competing activities. The visual arts
suffered particularly by it, regularly demeaned, as I remember, by
unconsidered hangs on temporary and inappropriate screens.
But the policy at large was rightly persevered with, and 10 years on is now
a matter for true celebration. The practical lessons were quickly learned,
the polemic quietly dropped, and the exhibitions, some 20 of them every
year, soon put on with an admirable and effective professionalism.
The current celebration falls into two complementary parts, the one rather
longer term than the other. Home as it now is of the old exhibitions
department of the Arts Council, the Festival Hall is also home to the Arts
Council's by now huge collection of modern British art, that fuels its loan
and touring exhibitions. It amounts to some 7,000 drawings, paintings and
sculpture, prints and photographs. The Festival Hall is itself a handsome
building, well worth celebrating, and what could be better than to put out a
few choice items of the collection to occupy those long clean walls and wide
lobbies, landings and terraces.
The latest rehang does just that, spreading nearly 50 assorted works around
the place, on every level from 1 to 6 and dating from 1951 and the opening
of the Hall itself, up to the day before yesterday. The point is less to
present a coherent if scattered exhibition than to offer the works for
themselves on their own terms, to be come upon in the course of the
building's natural public use, just as they might be, mutatis mutandis, in
any other miscellaneous collection, public or private. On the Green Side are
the quieter and more contemplative pieces, on the Red the more challenging
and confrontational. And from Reg Butler, Prunella Clough, Victor Willing
and Richard Long downstairs to Paula Rego, Peter de Francia and Elinor
Bellingham-Smith at the very top, it is a point well made.
The more temporary and particular exhibition in the main foyer itself, of
Recent British Painting and as well set up as ever, is somewhat more
questionable. Malgre the more strident of my critical colleagues to the left
of me, the more theoretical and doctrinaire of my curatorial friends to my
right, I can tell you now that painting is not dead, nor even moribund. It
never was. The only question is: what sort of painting do we mean?
Here, of the currency of recent years, is what has lately caught the Arts
Council's collective eye, and it includes, I must admit, work by artists,
such as Edwina Leapman, Peter Joseph, Yuko Shiraishi and Mikey Cuddihy, whom
I respect. The elegant minimalism of Joseph and Miss Leapman, oddly rich and
expressive and nervously intuitive respectively, particularly intrigues me.
I have never disavowed abstraction as such, nor do I intend to do so now;
but here, in what is almost uniformly an abstract show, even the work I
admire most seems now diminished, if only by a little, by an evident
orthodoxy.
The fault lies not with the artists themselves, who are ever free to work in
whatever way they feel most appropriate to what they wish to achieve.
Abstraction, after all, along with expressionism and surrealism,
conceptualism and all the rest of it, is the legitimate gift of modernism,
and it is not going to go away. But when we begin to feel that the artist
must now work only in a certain way in order to be noticed, let alone taken
seriously, then a certain resigned despair does set in.
Here we have, for the most part, conventionally large canvases, on which a
colour or tonal field is activated by a graphic or gestural incident of some
kind. It may be delicately done, done even with an exquisite aestheticism  -
but how soon such stuff sinks back into the formulaic and the merely
decorative. What little figurative reference there is tends to be
perfunctory and symbolic  - symbolic, that is to say, in the sense that the
mere proposal of the image is enough, and the realisation may be taken as
read. Has Peter Doig, with his 'Red Deer', ever sat out in the forest, and
drawn the trees and the deer, indeed ever looked at more than a photograph
of his animal friends? I think not.
And are those who collect thus on our behalf really saying that nothing else
of interest has been done these past 10 years or more? Is it now truly
passe, irrelevant, a waste of time, to set up a still-life for proper
scrutiny, to work from the head or the figure, to sit out in the field and
paint the landscape? Is that the kind of painting that has died? They would
indeed seem to say so, by so narrow a choice as this.
If there is a proper subject of current debate in the visual arts, it is not
at all to do with the variety or even the perversity of particular interest
or activity, but only this. It is simply the fashionable, narrow, unthinking
exclusivity of our cultural officers, in the interests they pursue and
decisions they take on our behalf, a narrowness never excused, never
defended, never explained. We are all ears.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Arts: Elton John: back on song - Pop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Elton John is still standing. He is also still straddling the keyboards;
boogieing; camping it up; and, a first for him, spitting. After battles with
drugs, sexual orientation, hair lines and, judging by a lacklustre
performance at Wembley last summer, his talent, he has won through. At
Earl's Court on Wednesday he was decidely on top.
Of course it is all much duller these days. After the years of entertainment
from Elton's fantasies we now get the man plain, as unadorned and artless as
an accounts clerk. He is dressed soberly by Versace rather than outrageously
by Walt Disney and the frissons of the past which made his performance
poignant, like watching a man on the edge of a precipice, are missing. He
does not live out the songs so emotionally, and the songs tend to be up-beat
and noisy. But who can begrudge Elton his new found enthusiasm.
The set, too, is functional, a lighting designers playground, and apart from
some dancing lasers, the only surprise is when the keyboard unit transforms
into a space pod and lifts Elton into the air and revolves him round the
stage. You are left with the music, belted out by the inevitably
professional and discreet band, spearheaded as ever by Davey Johnstone on
guitar.
Since the John-Taupin songbook is arguably the finest in pop there are bound
to be blissful moments, especially a plaintive and simple 'Sorry seems to be
the hardest word', and 'Empty Garden', his homage to John Lennon. But in the
main he was sweeping away the cobwebs by blasting out the belters, like
'Benny and the Jets' and 'The Bitch is Back'.
Sometimes there were signs that a man could get bored after 20 years of
global touring. His extended keyboard intros threatened to out-last the
melody, and 'Sad Songs' received such a protracted build up that you were
bored before he hit the theme. But as he climaxed this AIDS benefit concert
with Freddy Mercury's 'The Show Must Go On' you felt that Elton was more at
home communicating with 10,000 strangers than confined to his own company.

FT  14 MAY 93 / People: Pit closure winner
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was Peter Loughead, a high- flying civil servant, the government turned
to last year when it realised it had made a mess of plans to close 31 pits.
He readily fulfilled his ministers' wishes.
The white paper which subsequently emerged from the coal review he headed
was widely viewed as a masterpiece of presentation.
Without changing significantly the market for coal, it provided a reprieve
for 12 pits and was embraced by potentially dissident MPs.
The government has now rewarded Loughead by appointing him head of the
department of trade and industry's coal privatisation unit. He will lead a
team of 15.
The job is a civil service grade three post, the level to which Loughead
rose when he was hastily recruited from the Treasury in November.
Salaries for grade three appointees, formerly called under-secretaries,
range from Pounds 51,272 to Pounds 59,280.
Loughead, 42, educated at Liverpool Institute High School and Lincoln
College, Oxford, started his civil service career 18 years ago in the
department of prices and consumer protection as an administrative trainee.
He moved to the DTI's European policy division in 1985 as a grade five
worker. Five years later he joined the financial services division which
transferred to the Treasury in June 1992.
Coal privatisation is expected in the next parliamentary session. With coal
markets shrinking in the face of increased competition from gas, few people
expect the queue of potential buyers to be long.
Among the decisions facing Loughead's team will be whether to break British
Coal into small units or sell it as one or two large chunks.

FT  14 MAY 93 / People: Smooth run at St Ives
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There will be plenty of corporate financiers in the City who will cast an
envious glance at the ease with which 43-year-old Miles Emley has switched
careers and landed the chairmanship of St Ives, one of the biggest and most
successful companies in the international printing industry.
It is less than a year since Emley, then head of corporate finance at UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew, was offered the job as deputy chairman of St Ives by the
firm's founder, Bob Gavron. Emley didn't start until October, but yesterday
he was promoted to chairman with immediate effect.
Emley has spent most of his career as a merchant banker with N M Rothschild
and it was whilst he was there that he helped bring St Ives to the stock
market in 1985. Gavron says that Emley has been closely associated with the
company ever since and has been consulted on all strategic decisions. Gavron
says that he saw no reason to delay the handover once Emley had proved that
he could fit in.
Although Gavron insists that 'there is only room for one leader' at the top
of St Ives, the new executive chairman will not be short of experienced
boardroom colleagues to bounce ideas off.
Gavron will remain on the board until he reaches normal retirement age in
September 1995 and Brian Edwards, the group's 43-year-old managing director,
has been with the group since 1978.
Gavron admits that 'it will be very difficult to let go' of a company that
he founded nearly 30 years ago, but is looking forward to spending more time
on some of his other interests. He owns The Folio Society and Carcanet Press
and is chairman of the Open College of the Arts.
He has marked his decision to step down as chairman by cutting his family's
stake in the business by nearly half. However, after the sale of 6.7m
shares, the Gavron interests will retain 8.4 m shares, representing 8.5 per
cent of the company. Gavron himself will remain the biggest shareholder and
intends to hold his remaining 7m shares as a long term investment.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Technology: Time to recycle plastic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A breakthrough has been achieved in recycling the plastic commonly used in
food and beverage containers, polyethylene terephthalate (PET).
Food authorities in the US and Australia have approved a method of
sandwiching recycled PET between virgin layers of the plastic, allowing
material collected from consumers to be used again by the food industry.
The technique - called the Multilayer Repete System - has been developed by
two packaging subsidiaries of the UK industrial conglomerate BTR,
Continental PET Technologies of the US and ACI Petalite of Australia, in
conjunction with an equipment designer, Husky Injection Mouldings of Canada.
It permits the co-injection moulding of two materials into a three-layer
structure in which the recycled PET is laminated between an inner and outer
layer of virgin PET to form the wall of a container.
To win regulatory consent, the middle layer of recycled PET was
intentionally tainted with abnormally high levels of contaminants. Tests
showed that the surrounding layer of virgin material effectively prevented
the migration of contaminants which might survive the washing and moulding
processes.
The 'letter of no objection' issued by the US Food and Drug Administration
was conditional on the recycled PET being separated from food by a virgin
layer of PET at least 1/1,000in thick. By the end of this month, equipment
to mould simultaneously up to 48 types of container will be in production.
Alan Jackson, BTR's chief executive, said: 'The Multilayer Replete System
provides the potential to increase significantly plastics recycling and we
are continuing to develop the technology to broaden its range of packaging
applications.'
In Australia, ACI pioneered the development of PET recycling via kerbside
collections throughout Australia. Its PET recycling plant at Wondonga in
Victoria - the largest in the southern hemisphere - recycled more than 100m
bottles in 1992.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Technology: Heavy toll to bear - Without a European-wide
policy on electronic road pricing, chaos could ensue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the nightmare that could face European motorists in the last years
of the 20th century.
All over the continent, countries are looking at ways of tackling congestion
and raising revenues through the introduction of electronic road tolls. But
unless they reach agreement on a common technology, the consequences for
motorists could prove not only costly, but chaotic.
Drivers could, for example, find themselves having to fit their vehicles
with a different type of electronic debiting device for every town or city
they regularly visited. On top of that, they could need a separate system
for paying electronic tolls on motorways. Different systems again could be
required for competing private-sector toll roads. As for motorists driving
regularly between different countries, they could find themselves laden with
so many electronic devices that their vehicles would be left with little
room for anything else.
This is one of the difficult issues confronting John MacGregor, Britain's
transport secretary, as he contemplates the introduction of road user
charges in the UK. Soon, he is expected to bring out a green paper proposing
the introduction of tolls on the country's trunk roads and motorways.
In the run-up to this event, he has this week been looking at electronic
tolling systems in Oslo, Norway, and Gothenburg, south-west Sweden, to see
what lessons they can pass on.
What he found in Oslo was a curious hybrid between an urban road pricing
system and motorway tolls. Since 1990, motorists passing any of 19 entry
points to the city have had to hand over NKr11 (Pounds 1.05). (There are
discounts for season tickets; lorries pay double.) But the aim is not to
ease congestion by discouraging drivers from entering the city. Rather, as
with MacGregor's planned motorway tolls, it is to raise money for building
roads - in this case, the construction of roads in tunnels under the city to
cope with projected traffic growth.
At most of the 19 entry points, motorists have three ways of paying the
entry fee. Two are manual: typically, one lane allows drivers to hand over
money and receive change and another two allow them to throw the exact
payment into a basket before driving through. But a third, quicker method,
allows drivers to open accounts with the toll-collecting authority and have
their vehicles fitted with simple electronic tags, each reflecting a unique
radar profile. This means they can pass the toll points without stopping;
their tags are read by roadside beacons and their accounts are debited
automatically by computer at the toll-collecting authority's headquarters.
As with most toll systems, there are no physical barriers at the toll
booths; vehicles have their number plates photographed if their drivers fail
to pay. In the electronic lanes, every approaching vehicle has its tag
number compared with a list on the toll station's computer and if the
corresponding account is not in credit, a photograph of the vehicle's number
plate is recorded on disc. Once a day, the central computer at headquarters
transmits an up-dated list of valid and invalid tags to every toll station
computer, and once a day, each tolling station sends back to headquarters
the computer data containing the photographic records of apparent offenders.
It sounds straightforward enough, but there are drawbacks with Oslo's
electronic system. It is not linked to similar systems operating in two
other Norwegian cities, Bergen and Trondeheim, so motorists moving
frequently between the three need to open separate accounts in each city.
Also, the verification system is relatively cumbersome and results in a lot
of wasted effort on enforcement. Even in this relatively small city, with
its population of around 500,000, the system is clocking up 5,000 violations
a day. It turns out that most result from the delay in keeping toll stations
up to date with information about motorists' payments into their accounts.
In Sweden, the system on trial in Gothenburg - yet to be brought into
operation - differs radically from Oslo's in transferring the performance of
the financial transaction from a central computer to the vehicle. Here, the
driver charges up an electronic smart-card with money (probably at a petrol
station) and plugs it into an in-car device that debits payments from the
card when triggered by microwave signals from roadside transmitters.
There is no transaction with any centralised computer; indeed, the system
does not need to know anything about the vehicles that pass as long as the
in-car device is working. It only becomes involved if the beacon fails to
receive a positive response from an in-car device, at which point the
vehicle's number plate is photographed for follow-up action.
Some Norwegians are scathing about the Swedish experiment. They believe it
is vital to keep road pricing technology as simple as possible at the point
of use. Transferring the intelligence from a central computer to the vehicle
means transferring not only the cost of the technology to the vehicle owner,
they say, but also the risk of electronic or mechanical failure, or
tampering.
But the Swedes have a persuasive response. The Norwegian system, they point
out, requires a constant verification process between toll station computers
and a central computer holding details of subscribers' accounts. While this
may be feasible on a small scale in a city such as Oslo, the sheer scale of
the data transactions involved would make the system hopelessly unwieldy in
cities with higher traffic densities and even more so if extended across
entire countries. The existence of central computer records of vehicle
accounts also raises issues of privacy.
Encouragingly, the Swedes recognise the importance of developing a
European-wide road-pricing technology and are working with an EC road
informatics programme called Drive to evolve common standards.
One thing that looks certain is that it is not going to get any cheaper to
drive from one end of Europe to the other. But at least it may be possible
to do so with just one device inside your vehicle, one smart-card to insert
into it, and without anyone knowing where you have gone.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Invesco MIM is expected shortly to appoint Bill Stuttaford, currently
chairman of Brown Shipley Investment Management, as non-executive chairman
of its European regional business.
Invesco, which expects the nearly two year long investigation by regulators
Imro to be concluded within the next thirty days, is engaged in a drive to
break away from its over-exciting past, restore its battered reputation and
replace a number of high-profile departures.
Stuttaford, 64, is a well known City figure in broking and fund management
circles. Chairman of the Unit Trust Association between 1987-1989, his
heyday was building up fund manager Framlington; the latter was taken over
by Throgmorton in an acrimonious bid battle, and Stuttaford left a year
later for Brown Shipley. Brown Shipley Holdings in turn has just been
purchased by Sir Ron Brierley's Guinness Peat.
Stuttaford, while generally well-liked, has little track record in
turnaround situations - and it is medical not company doctoring that his
brother Thomas, medical columnist on The Times, knows about.
While Charles Brady is executive chairman of the main board, the group is
devolving regional control to three subsidiary boards splitting up the US,
Europe and the Far East. Norman Riddell is the recently arrived chief
executive of the European operation.
Many of the links with Invesco MIM's past and the days of ex-chairman Lord
Stevens and Britannia Arrow are being severed.
Kevin Ney and Lord Rippon, who have both been on the board since 1977, are
stepping down at the June agm as is Sir David Nicolson.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Technology: Helicopters fly with fuzzy logic - Worth
Watching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Because helicopters are difficult to operate, many companies have a hard
time recruiting pilots for dangerous activities such as mountain surveys or
photography of dangerous sites.
The Tokyo Institute of Technology and the Omron Corporation believe they
could have solved the problem with an electronic control system for unmanned
industrial helicopters.
The control system uses 'fuzzy' logic, a computer technique designed to
handle unpredictable sequences of events such as the flying movements of a
helicopter.
The Tokyo Institute developed the control programs and Omron the chips and
other hardware for the project. For the field test the organisations used a
Yamaha craft with a 20kg payload. Omron: Japan: 813 3436 7139.

<TEXT>
Bus passengers in the West Midlands will be the first in the UK to benefit
from an information system which uses satellite technology to inform
travellers when the next bus will arrive.
Centro, the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive, has placed a Pounds
1.2m contract with a consortium led by ICL Enterprises to develop a pilot
system to operate on two bus routes from the summer of 1994.
The buses will carry equipment to enable them to calculate their position
within 30 yards, using the global positioning system navigational
satellites. The bus then sends this information back to base by radio.
By sampling the position of the bus every 30 seconds and combining this with
knowledge of the route held on the central computer, software algorithms can
calculate when the bus will arrive at each stop. This information will be
displayed on electronic screens at the bus stops. Centro: UK, 021 200 2787.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Management: Baby Bell's bad behaviour - In the week that
Fiat adopted its new ethics code, Martin Dickson explains why business
morality is a big issue on both sides of the Atlantic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They were nicknamed 'the perverts' conventions'. They were wild, lewd
business parties thrown in Florida in the 1980s by employees of Nynex, the
'Baby Bell' company serving the northeastern US, and they led to a serious
crisis inside the group and a wholesale review of its business ethics.
Nynex's painful experience, spelt out by William Ferguson, the chairman, at
a recent New York conference on business ethics, gives an insight into three
questions at the centre of the current debate over business conduct on both
sides of the Atlantic.
Why are so many companies focusing on the issue now? Is this just a fad,
best ignored in the win-by-all-means pursuit of profits? And if not, how can
businesses best avoid ethical lapses?
There is no question that ethics has been receiving more executive attention
in the last few months.
An international survey published last year by the Conference Board, the
business issues group which organised the New York conference, found that
corporate ethics codes, 'once regarded as a reactive phenomenon to deflect
cyclical outburst of public distrust of business institutions. . . now enjoy
a broad base of support within individual companies'.
In the UK, ethics has been much debated in the wake of British Airways'
'dirty tricks' campaign against rival Virgin Atlantic.
And in Italy, the giant Fiat group this week spelt out new guidelines for
employees who have to deal with government officials, political parties and
civil servants. The move is widely expected to be followed by other big
Italian companies, notably the Eni energy and chemicals concern which has
been implicated in allegations of corruption and kickbacks on public-sector
contracts.
In the US, ethics is one of the most popular courses at the Harvard Business
School, while New York's Columbia University Business School has made the
issue one of four core principles meant to permeate all its courses.
The trend owes something to the backlash against the 'greed is good'
morality which characterised the takeover boom of the 1980s. However, more
practical business considerations also come into play:
The increased attention given to business news in the US media. Big stories
often appear on the front page of US general interest papers, rather than
hidden away in a financial section. That means much greater potential for
bad publicity, with the attendant loss of business and staff morale.
Nynex's experience demonstrates the power of the general press and the
damage it can inflict. When in 1988 the company discovered that a handful of
executives were inviting businessmen who supplied goods to the company to
sleazy Florida parties, it quietly sacked or disciplined the perpetrators,
hoping this would end what it believed was an 'isolated incident'.
However, says Ferguson, the New York press pounced on the story. Nynex
employees who read about the parties found themselves facing 'a crisis of
confidence and trust in one another. . . Even senior managers sitting across
a conference table started to wonder if it was happening in the other
person's shop'.
The increasingly global nature of industry. This means that many US
companies are expanding or selling abroad for the first time, forcing them
to focus on business practices in other countries which would not be
acceptable at home.
Legal changes in the US. The US Sentencing Commission - a body established
by Congress in 1984 to tackle criticism of light sentences for white-collar
crime - established tough new guidelines in November 1991 for corporate
offences such as fraud and bribery.
The guidelines allow an extremely wide range of sentences for the same
crime, depending on the degree of culpability the courts assign to the
corporation. A company's fine will be greatly reduced if it can show it has
'an effective programme to prevent and detect violations of the law' - in
other words, a strong ethics framework.
The effect on profits. Perhaps the strongest argument in favour of a
well-implemented code is that it may boost the bottom line - particularly in
the rapidly changing working environment of the 1990s - though this
assertion is impossible to prove statistically.
Companies are placing a growing emphasis on the quality of their goods and
services, by focusing on customer satisfaction and closer relations with
suppliers. These trends carry with them implied ethical contracts between
the parties involved.
Simultaneously, the flattening of corporate organisations and the devolution
of responsibility down the line to workers in an attempt to speed
decision-making also involves ethical considerations. Newly 'empowered'
workers need to have a proper sense of right and wrong if they are to make
quick, correct judgments.
Says Nynex's Ferguson: 'We are not interested in ethics because we are
trying to create an 'ethics society' or sub-culture at Nynex. Instead, we
are trying to make ethical behaviour an everyday norm. . . because,
basically, we believe ethics makes good business sense.'
How did Nynex recover from its ethics crisis? It first appointed outside
experts to see where it needed improvement, and then established a new
framework for business conduct. It created an office of ethics at its
headquarters, run by a senior executive with direct access to the chairman
and responsible to the board's audit committee.
Similar offices were established in each of its leading business units, with
'hotlines' for people to report misconduct. About 90 per cent of calls,
however, have been requests for information, clarification or assistance
with human resource matters; only 10 per cent have been about alleged
violations.
Nynex also drew up a single code of business conduct to replace the
differing codes in force in separate units.
It then began company-wide training in business ethics, which initially met
with a sceptical response. 'Many executives started out feeling too much was
being made out of an isolated incident which didn't involve them,' says
Ferguson. 'Most managers saw 'bottom-line, hard business issues' as
priorities - and ethics didn't make that shortlist.'
However, as training progressed the participants began to discover there
were many grey areas in their work that needed clarification.
'For example, what if an employee finds a competitor's proposal, left behind
on the seat of the commuter train?' Ferguson says that 'once you start
working on so-called 'soft' issues like ethics, you find out that they are a
lot harder than you thought.'
But he adds that 'unless you can change the 'soft' things about your
business, you're not going to be terribly successful in getting at the
'hard' things you face. In fact, these two areas are intimately related to
each other. The problem is that most people don't think they are.'
Besides his own law, Ferguson offers four main lessons from Nynex's
experience. First, there is a large difference between 'compliance' with
ethics codes and a genuine commitment to them.
Second, face-to-face communication is helpful in getting people to accept
ethics codes. 'Counter the doubters and sceptics - and that's most people -
by forcing them to engage in a sustained dialogue about how ethics affects
their conduct.'
Third, make sure ethics is part of a continuing commitment, not just
'programme of the month'.
Finally, leadership on ethics begins at the top. 'The role model that
managers set for their employees, knowingly or otherwise, is the most
important weapon in the ethics arsenal.'

FT  14 MAY 93 / Management: Job title inflation hits the roof - A trend
spreading out of control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are probably more admirals than ships in the British navy today. Soon,
given the exodus of Anglo Catholics from the Church of England, there might
be more bishops than congregations. And in the jargon of politically
incorrect speech, most organisations appear to have more chiefs than
indians.
Monetary inflation may be under control in Britain, but the same cannot be
said for job titles. Nearly all Americans over the age of 23 seem to have
the title 'executive vice-president' embossed on their business cards - and
the trend is spreading.
New-fangled job titles have elaborate suffixes, usually manager, director or
engineer if British, and president or officer if American. Prefixes such as
senior, executive or corporate are also common. One can mix and match any
set of these to come up with a grand, but meaningless, title.
As a result, employees are often more concerned about their official titles
than their responsibilities. Some ask in interviews 'what will I be called?'
more often than 'what will I be doing?'.
Traditionally 'flat' organisations - those with relatively few levels or
grades such as universities - are under pressure to invent new titles to
keep their ambitious staff happy. Traditionally 'tall' organisations - the
army or the civil service - go on inventing new job titles by rendering
generalists into specialists, however minor the task.
Why does this happen? At first glance it seems to many managers a relatively
cheap way to reward productivity or service. Many people, eager to satisfy
their unquenchable self-esteem thirst, are happy to accept an improved job
title in lieu of a sizeable salary increase. And, it follows, the more
problems people have with self-confidence and respect, the more they like to
compensate with fancy titles.
The inflationary force of the job title is particularly rife in the service
sector where people are driven more by carrot than by stick. A few examples
include:
An airline that has 54 levels, including four ranks of tea-lady.
A bank that has more than 30 tiers with nearly a dozen known as 'manager'.
A hotel chain with more than 40 job titles.
Some sectors inflate title grandiosity, but do not increase the number of
ranks. This happens in the publishing world where to compensate for
relatively low pay everyone is a 'director'.
But, as with all inflation, there are dangers. There is a limit to the
number of grand titles that exist; the more they are used, the more
worthless they become.
Far from being a cheap ego trip for staff, job title inflation often raises
expectations that cannot be fulfilled. Traditionally, job titles prescribed
what one did and did not do. Secretaries type for managers, who may have
keys to the executive wash-room, an additional telephone or a company car. A
title comes with a package of perks, which can be very costly.
Some companies, in a spirit of crypto-egalitarianism, have chosen to
withdraw in-house signs of rank and privilege - the managerial dining room,
car park, executive lavatories - while at the same time doubling the number
of people with manager, director or some such term in the organisation.
Others are just bizarre. Not long ago a British quango had employees with
the title of 'general worker'. Although this term seems more often used in
an ant colony it endured for many years until job title inflation required
it to be changed into 'chemical facilitator' or 'technical steward'.
There are better ways of motivating staff than tripling the number of levels
in an organisation. Those business gurus who suggest that the flatter the
organisation the fatter the profits probably have a point.

FT  14 MAY 93 / The Property Market: Treading troubled waters - John Redwood
outlines government policy on regenerating Britain's inner cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Redwood, the UK inner cities minister, would make an unlikely estate
agent. But he is talking up the property market with an enthusiasm that
would put many agents in the shade.
'Since I entered business in the early 1970s I have never seen better
conditions for investing money in land and buildings,' he said in a speech
to the building industry yesterday.
These sentiments echo a House of Commons speech the minister made a month
ago when he said that the private sector needed 'more courage and confidence
and a willingness to respond to the new climate'.
The commercial property industry has responded wearily to these
exhortations. Its reaction was summed up in the Estates Times, a property
magazine, with the headline: 'Tosh, Mr Redwood.' It accused the minister of
navety in underestimating the problems facing recession-hit banks and
property companies.
Some critics go further, arguing that the government is harming any chances
of renewed development by its failure to act over the uncertainty
surrounding commercial lease structures and contaminated land legislation,
and by delays in agreeing infrastructure projects.
Mr Redwood is undaunted by the derision that greeted his comments. He, in
turn, is scathing about the advice given by industry experts in recent
years.
Industry criticism of his Commons speech has reinforced Mr Redwood's
viewpoint. He turns the argument that there is a shortage of finance for
property investment on its head: the tightness of credit, which is now
easing, is precisely the reason why he thinks the bottom of the cycle has
been reached.
Mr Redwood is on less secure ground in his belief that when the pick-up
occurs, investors will focus on new developments in the inner cities. After
the huge losses of the past few years, there is little enthusiasm among
developers and banks for such ventures.
Mr Redwood thinks sceptics are commiting the 'metropolitan fallacy' of
assuming that the problems of the London office market are replicated round
the country. 'Those in the north, on Tyneside, Teesside or in Manchester
have a less jaundiced perspective as regeneration has received less of a
jolt from the recession,' he said.
He acknowledged that London is a special problem. But he is still convinced
that recovery will extend to even the blighted parts of Docklands. Canary
Wharf will be 'a flourishing and successful development' in 5-10 years, he
said.
What about the Royal Docks, a vast area to the east of the Isle of Dogs
which has spent heavily on infrastructure without, so far, having attracted
any private sector development? Even Mr Redwood recognises that the
oversupply of offices elsewhere in Docklands makes large-scale office
development at the Royal Docks unviable.
But he is anxious to see action. 'I am impatient about the Royal Docks,' he
said. Mr Redwood has already given approval to an urban village housing
scheme on the south side of the docks. And he believes there is scope for
leisure and retail uses; he said he would even contemplate approving plans
for warehouses.
Mr Redwood has given the London Docklands Development Corporation, the
quango overseeing the regeneration of the area, until the summer to come up
with plans to develop the Royal Docks. If the LDDC fails, Mr Redwood said he
would hold a competition in the hope that the private sector will come up
with a viable idea.
But even if the private sector is brought on board again, doubts remain
about the broad thrust of government policy on reviving inner cities through
physical regeneration.
Mr Christopher Jonas, president of the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors, recently described government investment in inner city
regeneration as 'little more than a complete failure'.
He added: 'Despite some notable successes, cities such as Glasgow,
Manchester, Liverpool, Sheffield and Bradford have a startling array of
failures which collectively represent hundreds of millions of pounds of
taxpayers' money, which could, perhaps, have been more usefully directed
elsewhere.'
Government strategy is also criticised as being too preoccupied with
physical regeneration and insufficiently concerned with its impact on local
communities. A report published this week by the University of Durham said
that government-created urban development corporations (UBC)  - which are
empowered to clean up land, assemble development sites and provide grants to
kick-start development  - were expensive, concentrated excessively on
physical regeneration and had little positive impact on inner city
communities, such as in job creation.
Mr Redwood rejects criticism of the UDCs, insisting that their record was
one of 'considerable achievement'.
UDCs remain a central aspect of the government's strategy for urban renewal.
Mr Redwood recently announced the setting up of a new UDC for Plymouth,
while the new Urban Regeneration Agency  - responsible for regenerating
broader urban areas and described by Mr Redwood as a 'roving UDC'  - comes
into force later this year.
In some respects government policy towards UDCs has evolved. While the
policy of attracting private sector funds to augment public investment
remains fixed, there has been a shift in the government's attitude to the
role of local councils. The combative exchanges between local authorities
and UDCs in the early 1980s has given way to a more harmonious relationship.
'It is more possible now for UDCs and local government to work together,' he
said.
Mr Redwood is also proud of the City Challenge programme, a partnership
between councils, the private sector and voluntary bodies to give local
communities a greater involvement in urban regeneration. A decision on the
next round of City Challenge has been postponed because of a lack of money,
but Mr Redwood remains enthusiastic about its future. 'As soon as I get
additional money it will go into City Challenge. I like the concept.'
The most recent shift in government policy on inner cities came in the
Autumn Statement, when the Treasury was given powers to relax rules on
private-sector investment in public projects.
This blurring of the edges between public and private finance could allow
the government to shoulder some of the risk involved in development. 'To get
it (development) going we should be prepared to take on some of the risk,'
Mr Redwood said.
The mechanism by which the government would shoulder the risk would, in
commercial property, be by granting developers rental guarantees for up to
three years; in private sector housing, it would be by taking a share of
profits in return for providing land.
But these measures aside, Mr Redwood's claims that the risks of development
are being exaggerated by the private sector are unlikely to spur developers.
Confidence is at such a low ebb that his exhortations will continue to fall
on deaf ears for some time yet.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Abta payouts challenged: Travel companies seek injunction to
stop cut in customer refunds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX TRAVEL companies have applied for an injunction requiring the
Association of British Travel Agents to withdraw a threat to limit
repayments to customers of failed school-trip operators.
The application follows a letter Abta sent to education authorities last
month saying the association had decided to limit the losses it suffered
when school-tour operators, particularly those offering ski holidays,
failed.
A High Court hearing on the application began last Tuesday and finished
yesterday. The six companies  - Travelbound, Equity, Campus Centres, Ski
Partners, Seasun Holidays and STS Travel  - are awaiting judgment.
Since setting up its system of consumer protection in the mid-1970s, Abta
has said it will ensure that customers are repatriated and their deposits
repaid when member companies fail. Abta members have bonds to protect
customers, but when these prove inadequate the association's insurance makes
up the shortfall.
But in 1991 the association came close to financial collapse when it had to
make repayments to parents who had paid for ski trips organised by companies
which folded. In its letter, the association said it had paid out almost
Pounds 12m to parents over the past three years.
It said that deposits paid after April 23 this year would not be protected
if paid more than 12 months in advance. If paid less than a year in advance
they would only be protected up to Pounds 25 a head. The balance of payment
would be protected only if it was paid less than 10 weeks before departure.
The association subsequently wrote to education authorities and schools
pointing out that the limits only applied where failed companies' bonds were
inadequate.
The restrictions applied to coach and ferry trips only. Charter flight
holidays would still be protected fully by Air Travel Organisers' Licences,
administered by the Civil Aviation Authority.
Mr Andrew Lay, Travelbound's commercial director, said the letters had
caused confusion. He said: 'At present, everyone believes if they book a
holiday with Abta their money is secure.'

FT  14 MAY 93 / Names win right to take action against agents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S NAMES can take legal action against their agents even if they have
not paid their insurance losses, a High Court judge ruled yesterday.
Mr Justice Saville was ruling on a preliminary issue in proceedings brought
by several thousand Names against their managing and members' agents at the
insurance market.
The agents had contested that 'pay now, sue later' clauses in the agreements
signed with them by Names  - the individuals whose assets support
underwriting at Lloyd's  - precluded those Names who were unable to meet
their losses from pursuing legal action.
In a 10-page written judgment Mr Justice Saville said that if the 'pay now,
sue later' clause were applied in these cases it would 'deprive a Name with
no funds of the only asset which could be utilised to pay the call, namely
the value of his claim against his agent'. Mr Justice Saville also awarded
immediate costs to the Names.
Names' leaders yesterday welcomed the decision. Mr Michael Deeny, chairman
of the Gooda Walker Action Group who is named in the action, said: 'This is
a very important victory in the fight to obtain compensation for Gooda
Walker Names.'
Mr Colin Hook, chairman of the Feltrim Names Association, described the
ruling as 'a victory for common sense'.
The agents may appeal, but the ruling clears the way for actions by several
thousand Names to proceed. In the two biggest actions more than 2,000 Gooda
Walker and Feltrim Names are arguing that negligence by their agents was
responsible for insurance losses of more than Pounds 1bn.
The Feltrim Names have filed for a summary judgment in their action in a
case set to be heard in court in the autumn.
Meanwhile, Mr Hook said he hoped that the ruling 'would act as a spur and an
encouragement to those at Lloyd's trying to resolve the litigation'. Mr
Deeny and Mr Hook are expected to meet Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief
executive, on Monday to explore a possible out-of-court settlement of their
actions.
Feltrim and Gooda Walker syndicates were active in the market for
catastrophe reinsurance at Lloyd's in the late 1980s.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Richmond Park sees the return of shire horses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shire horses are returning to Richmond Park, west London, after an absence
of more than 30 years. Mr Mike Fitt, park superintendent, said two horses
(above) have begun work in a pilot scheme to reduce the costs of using
tractors and other vehicles.
The park's management is seeking sponsorship 'in the region of Pounds
500,000' to fund the scheme, which will include fitting out farm buildings
to use as a nature study centre for school parties and disabled people.
The horses are being used for haymaking, harrowing and as an environmentally
friendly method of transportation in woodland conservation areas. If the
scheme is successful the management of the royal parks hopes to extend the
use of working horses to other London parks.

COOPERS &amp; LYBRAND, the accountancy firm, is to be scrutinised as part of a
wide-ranging investigation into the Maxwell affair by the accountancy
profession's highest disciplinary body.
The Joint Disciplinary Scheme is to investigate the circumstances
surrounding pensions transactions within the business empire of the late
Robert Maxwell.
The scheme rarely launches investigations and only holds them for serious
issues that command a high level of public interest.
Just two investigations are under way: into Barlow Clowes and Bank of Credit
and Commerce International.
The scheme is operated jointly by the chartered accountancy organisations
for England, Wales and Scotland and the Chartered Association of Certified
Accountants.
It has the power to examine and discipline member firms and any individual
members in either public practice or commercial work.
A committee of inquiry is being selected for the Maxwell case and the formal
announcement of an investigation is likely to be made within the next two
months.
In the meantime, the newly appointed 'executive counsel' will examine the
background to the case and prepare evidence before submitting it to the
committee.
The Maxwell investigation has been triggered by a referral from the
Securities and Investments Board last summer to the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales, which has in turn passed it on to the
scheme.
It will examine pensions transactions relating to Bishopsgate Investment
Management, London and Bishopsgate Investment Management and a further 10 or
more companies in the group. More than Pounds 440m was stolen from the
pensions funds.
Details of the Maxwell inquiry emerged in the latest annual report from the
scheme, which was circulated yesterday.
The accounts for the year to December 31 1992 show expenditure of Pounds 1m,
which is exactly offset by income, including Pounds 142,000 recoverable from
fines and costs awarded.
There have been 33 referrals to the committee, 31 completed investigations
and 15 appeals since the scheme was founded in 1979.

Mr Grade said that Sky Movies Plus was the quintessence of the government's

THE rate of decline in workloads of civil engineers has reduced
substantially and there are signs of confidence starting to return, a survey
published today shows.
Mr John Hackett, director-general of the Federation of Civil Engineering
Contractors, described the survey as 'the best set of results we've had in
three years, but not good enough for us to be able yet to announce the end
of the recession in civil engineering construction'.
Contractors' profit margins remained under severe pressure, he said.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Training success rate improves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of adult jobless people getting jobs or gaining qualifications
has started to improve, Lisa Wood writes.
The number of people leaving Employment Training last July with a
qualification was 43 per cent, compared with 36 per cent the previous year,
a government survey shows.
The number going into jobs or further education was 39 per cent compared
with 34 per cent 12 months before.
Employment Training, which has been amalgamated with Employment Action, the
work-experience scheme, since April, has been criticised because of its poor
success record. Before it was handed over to the Training and Enterprise
Councils, which have modified programmes to local needs, it was run by the
Department of Employment.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Doubt cast on red-tape review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANY directors are highly sceptical about government efforts to reduce
the burden of red tape on businesses. Nearly 70 per cent of directors
believe the campaign will make little or no difference to the level of
regulation, an Institute of Directors' survey shows today.
The campaign against red tape, initiated by Mr John Major, the prime
minister, involves a review of regulations by every government department.
Seven taskforces made up of businesspeople are drawing up priorities for
de-regulation.
While more than 80 per cent of directors questioned by the institute said it
was important for the government to reduce bureaucracy, only 30 per cent
believed the exercise would be successful.
The institute said the finding emphasised the need for the government to
'achieve early, concrete results to convince firms that it means business'.
Top of the directors' list of most troublesome burdens are value added tax,
health and safety regulations, employment-protection laws, and planning
rules. VAT rules cause problems for 27 per cent of directors, and for 33 per
cent of directors in companies employing fewer than 100 people. The
institute is suggesting a number of reforms, including extending the
flat-rate VAT scheme available to farmers.
Health and safety has become more of an issue because of the implementation
of six European Community directives at the beginning of this year, the
institute said.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Britain's pay and benefits costs low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S employment costs are among the lowest in western Europe, research
on average pay and benefits shows.
The study, by actuarial consultants Noble Lowndes, found that Britain's
employment costs - comprising pay, social security contributions, income tax
paid by employees, and voluntary and mandatory supplementary benefits - are
only marginally higher than Spain's.
The comparison of likely living standards upon retirement shows that state
social security plus private pension provisions will earn the average Briton
77 per cent of net earnings at retirement. This compares with 93 per cent
for Dutch pensioners, 91 per cent for Italian pensioners and 75 per cent for
German pensioners.
The costs of social security in Britain are also more evenly spread between
employer and employee than in some other EC states. UK employers pay 40 per
cent of social costs while in Italy they pay 70 per cent.
Sweden and Switzerland respectively are the most expensive countries when
pay and social costs are considered against the purchasing power of the
local currency.
In Sweden, for instance, for each Skr100 of take-home pay, an employer must
allocate a further Skr105 to cover social costs. In the UK, the employer
must provide an additional Pounds 67 for every Pounds 100 of take-home pay.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Directors sceptical on cutting red tape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANY directors are highly sceptical about government efforts to reduce
the burden of red tape on businesses. Nearly 70 per cent of directors
believe the campaign will make little or no difference to the level of
regulation, an Institute of Directors' survey shows today.
The campaign against red tape, initiated by Mr John Major, the prime
minister, involves a review of regulations by every government department.
Seven taskforces made up of businesspeople from different sectors are
drawing up priorities for de-regulation.
While more than 80 per cent of directors questioned by the institute said it
was important for the government to reduce bureaucracy, only 30 per cent
believed the exercise would be successful. The institute said the finding
emphasised the need for the government to 'achieve early, concrete results
to convince firms that it means business'.
Top of the directors' list of most troublesome burdens are value added tax,
health and safety regulations, employment-protection laws, and planning
rules. VAT rules cause problems for 27 per cent of the directors, and for 33
per cent of directors in companies employing fewer than 100 people. The
institute is suggesting to the government a number of reforms, including an
extension of the flat-rate VAT scheme available to farmers.
Health and safety has become more of an issue because of the implementation
in the UK of six European Community directives at the beginning of this
year, the institute said.
More than 40 per cent of directors believe government regulation has
restricted the ability of their businesses to expand and employ additional
people. The feeling was particularly strong among smaller businesses - a
worrying finding, given that smaller companies are generally agreed to have
been the main generators of new employment in the 1980s, the institute said.
Most directors spend up to two hours a week personally dealing with
regulation problems, the findings show. For directors of companies with
between 20 and 100 employees, that figure is nearly three-and-a-half hours a
week.
The survey was carried out for the institute by Taylor Nelson in April.
Interviews were by telephone among a structured sample of 304 out of the
institute's 33,500 UK members.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Wales picks up foreign plums: How the inward investment
trend is being bucked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR David Hunt, Welsh secretary, was banging the drum this week over foreign
investment in Wales.
The occasion was the 20th anniversary of the first arrival in Wales of a
Japanese company.
More striking was the fact that last year foreign direct investment in Wales
was higher than the year before.
This seems a remarkable exception to the general trend. Foreign investment
in Europe reached its peak at the end of the 1980s. Since then it has
dropped sharply, both in the European Community and in the UK overall.
But in Wales, according to Mr Hunt's officials, last year's figure of Pounds
825m for planned investment by foreign companies was 13 per cent up on 1991
and more than double the 1990 level.
Mr Hunt says that with only 5 per cent of the population, Wales has claimed
20 per cent of inward investment into the UK. This investment has more than
compensated for blows during the 1980s such as the closure of the Shotton
steelworks in Clwyd, north Wales.
Last year UK manufacturing output was 5 per cent higher than in 1979. Welsh
output, says Mr Hunt, was 27 per cent higher.
In seeking to define Wales' success in attracting foreigners Mr Hunt points
first to the quality of the Welsh workforce: 'I think the work ethic is the
most important factor. In Wales we've always had a tradition of working hard
and of long service with one employer. If you talk to a German company like
Bosch they will say their productivity in Wales is higher than it is in
Germany.'
Yet other UK regions could make similar claims. A more revealing difference
is the advantage Wales derives from the centralisation of functions in the
Welsh Office.
'We are the ultimate one-stop shop,' Mr Hunt says. 'An inward investor just
has to come to me or one of my colleagues. He doesn't need to see anyone
else.
'We bring everybody together, whether it's the Welsh Development Agency, the
local authority, the Training and Enterprise Council or the university.
'At the Welsh Office we have all the policies brought together  - education,
health, environment, industry, agriculture, transport and training.'
Mr Hunt takes an aggressive approach to marketing: 'I'm about to fly off at
the end of the month to North America where we have some very good
prospects.
'They all involve competition with other parts of Europe, not the UK.
'I'm generally fighting Ireland in particular, because they go out
positively to win manufacturing, and Spain.
'Belgium is getting very positive about investment too, and parts of France
are going out more savagely to win business.'
Above all, he says: 'I believe we combine better than any other country in
Europe. Led by the secretary of state and the chairman of the Welsh
Development Agency we go into boardrooms anywhere in the world and argue the
case for Wales. There aren't many other parts of the world that do that.'

FT  14 MAY 93 / Fire union votes for strike ballots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE conference of the Fire Brigades Union in Bridlington, Humberside, voted
unanimously yesterday to authorise two separate strike ballots among its
49,000 members. The first concerns alleged government threats to scrap the
14-year-old guaranteed pay formula ensuring firefighters' pay remains in the
upper quarter of male manual earnings. The second is over the threat of
compulsory redundancies in the fire service.
The FBU delegates, after a highly emotional debate, have set their union on
a collision course with the government. Speakers emphasised that the issue
at stake was not a demand for a pay rise that breached the 1.5 per cent
government pay limit figure for the public sector, but the continuation of
the pay formula.
In his speech to the conference, Mr Ken Cameron, the union general
secretary, stressed that the union was 'not about greedy fire service
workers' pay but honouring an agreement'.
Mr Cameron said the union was seeking an urgent meeting with the prime
minister, Mr John Major, to explain the gravity of the situation to him if
the government does not fully fund firefighters' pay increases and local
authority employers fail to honour the 1978 pay formula agreement.
The Home Office said yesterday that the date for the firefighters' pay award
was not until November 7, and therefore it was 'premature for the union to
go for strike action now'.
The union's leadership seems unlikely to wait until November to hold its
strike ballots. Conference resolutions have given the union's executive the
authority to organise their votes 'when appropriate'.
Mr Cameron would not be drawn on the date for holding the ballots, but he
told a press conference that the union intended initially to stop short of
an all-out strike if the union achieved majority support from its
membership.
In the meantime, the union will join ambulance staff and health workers on a
demonstration in London on May 26 against threats to public services caused
by government spending cuts.
The union had its first national strike in 1977, which lasted for nine weeks
and ended with establishing the pay formula, which the union initially
opposed.
As a result of the formula over the past 14 years firefighters' pay has
improved substantially. Between 1979 and 1981, when the formula was
introduced, firefighters' earnings rose 40 per cent, putting them in the top
quartile of male manual earnings, where they have remained ever since.
Many delegates argued yesterday that if the pay formula was abandoned by the
government it would pave the way for an attack on firefighters' terms and
conditions of employment and quality of the service.
The union believes it is fighting a defensive campaign against threats to
its very existence. Union leaders pointed out there has been a deterioration
in the fire service in recent years, saying there had been a 64 per cent
increase in emergency calls since 1980, while staffing levels increased by
only 2.5 per cent.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Junk mail sent in Revenue post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAILINGS of Inland Revenue information for employers, sent out for the first
time this year by contractors, included junk-mail advertising, the top civil
servants' union said yesterday.
Ms Elizabeth Symons, general secretary of the First Division Association,
told the union's annual conference that one employer received a car-parts
catalogue, a travel brochure, a guide to Tote betting, a leaflet from an
Islamic pressure group and a woman's skirt in his tax mailing.
The claim follows an admission last month by Sir Anthony Battishill,
chairman of the Inland Revenue board, that the mailings, which included
information about individual taxpayers, had been sent to the wrong
addresses.
The Revenue yesterday confirmed that there had been reports of 'extraneous
materials' in the mailing, but said there was no evidence that this was more
than the odd item inserted by mistake.
It said that the misaddressing of packs had arisen in the transfer of
computerised information from the Revenue to the main contractor.
The mailing, sent to 1.25m employers before the start of the tax year,
included instructions on operating the pay-as-you-earn system and PAYE codes
for new employees.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Private company aids tax reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INLAND REVENUE has awarded a private management consultancy a 10-week
contract to help with its plans for reforming the personal tax system.
P-E International, based in Egham, Surrey, has been awarded an initial
Pounds 150,000 contract for five staff to review the Revenue's strategy and
make recommendations on how it will be implemented.
If the work meets with Revenue approval, the company is likely to be awarded
a further three-year contract believed to be worth about Pounds 2.25m.
The second stage will cover support, analysis and advice on the changes
required in Revenue processes, internal organisation and information
technology.
It will primarily focus on simplification of the self-assessment personal
tax system, but also provide support for wider aspects of the current
internal restructuring of the Revenue.
The proposals for self-assessment of personal tax - which will affect up to
4m self-employed people and a similar number of other taxpayers - have been
heralded in two consultative documents and most recently in the chancellor's
Budget speech. They are due to be introduced for the 1996-97 tax year.
The appointment is the result of a recent public competition for the
contract, and follows wide-ranging proposals for reforms of the system of
self-assessment.
The system will introduce a method that is already in place in some
countries, such as the US, by which taxpayers estimate their own tax
liability and submit their tax forms to the Revenue along with payment.
At present the Revenue makes an assessment after taxpayers have returned
their forms, and a request for payment is sent out.
The Revenue hopes that the changes will reduce the demands on its time and
manpower from inquiries by taxpayers.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Major defiant at NUT test boycott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Union of Teachers yesterday extinguished any lingering chance
that meaningful national curriculum tests would take place this year when
members voted overwhelmingly for a boycott.
The NUT is the third union to boycott this summer's tests, and voted to do
so by the largest majority - 96 per cent of those who voted were in favour.
Turnout was 69.9 per cent, meaning that 67.3 per cent of eligible members
voted for a boycott.
Previously the NASUWT union voted by 88 per cent to boycott, on a turnout of
57 per cent. The ATL union had a vote of 82.7 per cent in favour on a
turnout of 56.8 per cent.
However Mr John Patten, education secretary, could take solace from the
growing evidence of a split between the teachers' unions over next year's
tests. Mr Patten announced on Tuesday that these would be substantially
slimmed down.
At Westminster Mr John Major, the prime minister, was defiant, rejecting
fresh Labour demands to call off this year's tests.
Mr Major, clashing with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, on the subject for
the third time in three weeks, said the result of yesterday's ballot made
him 'very sad'.
He questioned the motive behind the union's decision, saying people would
ask whether the NUT 'really do support the principle of regular testing in
our schools or whether there is another agenda that concerns them'.
Mr Smith said Mr Major's determination to press ahead was 'a sign of
weakness, not strength'.
Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, said the boycott would start
immediately, and added: 'The level of response by union members destroys for
ever accusations that the union was voicing the views only of militant,
politically motivated teachers.'
He criticised Mr Patten's statement on Tuesday, saying: 'Our reaction to
this announcement was not one of delight. We will still be arguing about
this even though there might be some reductions to workload for some
teachers.'
He also claimed Mr Patten's announcement had put a 'question mark' over the
independence of the review of the curriculum being carried out by Sir Ron
Dearing.
This contradicts the reaction of Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NASUWT general
secretary, who said: 'Teachers would be ill-advised not to respond in a
generally positive way to the dramatic and revolutionary concessions the
government made. As soon as the changes for next year are introduced then
the boycott by its very nature should lapse.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY backbenchers joined with opposition MPs last night in urging the
government not to undermine the Post Office network, particularly in rural
areas, by channelling the payment of pensions and other benefits through
banks and building societies.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said a study by the Department
of Social Security of different methods of payment had yet to be evaluated.
Earlier, the prime minister said the government aimed to 'encourage'
automated credit transfers while maintaining a 'viable' network of Post
Office outlets.

measure

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPS LAST night signalled that terrorist attacks would not be allowed to
wreck the operations of commerce and industry as the Reinsurance (Acts of
Terrorism) bill cleared all its Commons stages in just over three hours,
Ivor Owen writes.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said that even with the latest
increases, insurance premiums still represented a very small proportion of
total business costs and were good value overall.
He said the typical extra terrorism premium on a city-centre office block
insured for Pounds 10m would be Pounds 8,000 a year  - and the maximum would
be Pounds 12,000 a year.
Mr Hamilton confirmed that the bill, an enabling measure, would give effect
to the draft agreement establishing the Pool Reinsurance company.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd claims victory on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   EDINBURGH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR DOUGLAS HURD yesterday claimed victory over the Tory opponents of closer
European integration as he sketched out Britain's post-Maastricht agenda for
the future of the European Community.
With the government confident of victory in the crucial third-reading vote
on the Maastricht bill in the Commons next Thursday  - assuming that the
Danes vote Yes in their second referendum next Tuesday  - Mr Hurd said the
Tory party should look back on the wrangling as a 'bad dream'. He said that
the opponents of Maastricht were 'genuinely haunted'. But, he added, 'in the
light of day things look different'.
Representatives at the Scottish Conservative conference voted overwhelmingly
for a motion supporting Mr Hurd's stance on Europe, in spite of a stinging
attack on the Maastricht treaty by Mr Bill Walker, the Tory MP for Tayside
North.
Underlining the determination of the Foreign Office to ensure that Britain
has a leading role in shaping the next intergovernmental conference in 1996,
Mr Hurd dismissed the idea that transformation in Europe wrought by the
ending of the cold war would reduce the role of the Community.
He said: 'In the new Europe the role of the Community as a political anchor
and an economic motor has become more, not less, important.' In a phrase
calculated to emphasise his personal commitment to European co-operation,
the foreign secretary added: 'In terms of the history of Europe the
Community is still in its infancy.'
Mr Hurd said that the enlargement of the Community, first to 16 nations and
eventually to 20 or more, meant that it could not work on the same basis as
one of 12. But that should not weaken the existing core policies. Direct
co-operation between national governments  - as in existing frameworks for
foreign and crime policies  - would allow new areas of joint action.
But there would also be scope for groups of states to choose to work
together on different subjects.
Former Tory foreign secretary Lord Howe last night accused former prime
minister Lady Thatcher of doing everything in her power to undermine the
government's policy on Maastricht.
Lord Howe said that what she, Lord Tebbit and other anti-Maastricht
campaigners were doing was 'contrary to the interests of the country and of
Europe'.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories 'must speak for more Scots'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN LANG, Scottish secretary, said yesterday that Scottish Conservatives
needed to build on the new start they had gained at the last general
election and must seek to speak for more Scots.
In a largely light-hearted speech exulting the party's success in
confounding the sceptics by winning seats in last year's general election,
he said the Scottish party was now 'free from the siege mentality. Free from
the doubts and pessimism'.
He said that the Conservative party's agenda was the 'established agenda of
Scottish politics' and the party was 'central to the Scottish political
scene'.
What Scotland needed most in the 1990s was 'another dramatic advance for the
enterprise culture'. If Scottish industry had created as many new jobs per
head as the south-east of England, 'there would have been over 100,000 more
new firms in Scotland during the 1980s'. Scottish Enterprise, the
development body, had set a target of increasing the rate of company
formations by 50 per cent by the year 2000, creating an extra 50,000 jobs,
Mr Lang said.
He pointed out that since the Tories came to power in 1979 the rate of home
ownership in Scotland had risen from 35 per cent to 53 per cent. But he said
that was not enough. 'I want home ownership to reach 60 per cent by the end
of this parliament.' Although the rate of home ownership in Scotland has
risen, partly through the sale of council houses, it is still below that for
England which is close to 70 per cent.
Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister and a former Scottish Office
minister, closed the employment debate by praising Lady Thatcher.
He said: 'I made politics my career, sometimes I think my life, because I
was inspired by Margaret Thatcher and her determination to spread ownership,
choice and opportunity for all.' He added: 'That agenda is still unfinished
business and John Major is now carrying our torch.'
Indicating scepticism about the European Community, he said: 'I know there
are differing views in our party on the meaning and impact of the Maastricht
treaty, but there is one thing we can all agree on  - if Europe is to
succeed it must set its face against excessive regulation and
protectionism.'
He went on: 'Let's send a message to the European Commission: stop bringing
forward job-killing regulations which add to business costs, handicap
enterprise and lengthen dole queues.'

FT  14 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Clarke rules out bugging inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE yesterday ridiculed Labour calls for an investigation into
allegations that the security services had eavesdropped on members of the
royal family. He said there was not a 'shred' of evidence to support them.
The home secretary responded witheringly to demands from Mr Tony Blair for
an 'urgent investigation', accusing his Labour opposite number of being a
'tabloid politician'.
It was 'absolutely absurd' for MPs to be 'taking up this kind of nonsense at
the behest of the tabloid newspapers'. He would investigate claims that the
moon was made of green cheese if Labour could find a crumb of evidence to
support that theory.
Mr Blair said that either the transcripts circulating were forgeries, 'in
which case there has almost certainly been a serious offence of criminal
fraud', or they were genuine, 'in which case a gross intrusion of privacy by
illegal means' had taken place.
Cabinet ministers agreed yesterday to proceed in the next session of
parliament with legislation to put MI6 on a statutory basis. Restrictions
are also expected on media bugging devices and telephoto lenses and trespass
on private property.
But the government has not so far decided whether to bow to pressure from
MPs and agree to the setting up of a special scrutiny committee for MI5 and
MI6.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Committee attacks 'lack of
long-term policy on EC'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Commons foreign affairs committee yesterday implicitly criticised the
government for its lack of a long-term policy on the European Community and
recommended early steps to clarify its ideas on the subject, Robert Mauthner
writes.
In its second report on Europe after Maastricht, the committee also called
for improved contacts between the European parliament and national
parliaments, though stressing that the latter should not become subordinate
to the Strasbourg parliament.
'The United Kingdom needs to decide what sort of European Community it wants
and to push for it,' the report said. 'Planning for this should begin
immediately after the Maastricht treaty is ratified, to avoid being put in a
position of simply reacting to ideas from other member states.'
The committee also recommended that the House of Commons be given greater
opportunities to express its views to the executive on proposals for
Community action.
The Commons would need to re-examine its role in respect of EC legislation,
particularly in the light of the enhanced legislative powers given to the
European parliament under the terms of the Maastricht treaty.
Given the conflicting views about how the principle of subsidiarity would be
applied, and as a way of associating the Commons more closely with the
European Community's legislation, the committee recommended that the
government report regularly to the House.
This could take the form of six-monthly reports on 'developments in the
European Community', setting out the way the principle of subsidiarity was
being applied.
The principle states that the Community should take decisions only on
matters which cannot be dealt with more effectively by national governments.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Party confident of holding the line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APROPHECY in a political reference book that Christchurch could become the
safest Tory seat of all is certain to be dashed in the forthcoming
by-election.
But there are signs that the Conservatives will be able to hold on in spite
of their recent drubbing at Newbury, where a 12,000 Tory majority was turned
into a 22,000 Liberal Democrat triumph.
Christchurch, a pleasantly leafy constituency stretching from the Dorset
coast near Bournemouth up into the New Forest, could be a much harder nut to
crack for the Liberal Democrats.
Mr Robert Adley, the popular, independent-minded local MP who died
yesterday, held the seat at the last general election with a majority of
more than 23,000, making it the sixth-safest Conservative seat in the
country.
In the county council elections a week ago, Dorset as a whole succumbed to
the Liberal Democrats, who captured 17 seats and are now the largest party.
But in the parts of the county covered by the Christchurch constituency, the
Conservatives held on to all their seats. 'It must be the only Conservative
constituency in the country where we didn't lose a single seat,' said a
local party boss.
The Liberal Democrats admit they have a poor local organisation in the area
in contrast to the rest of the county, and in contrast to the experienced
and effective local Conservative organisation.
Mrs Judy Jamieson, Mr Adley's agent since 1984, is vice-chairman of the
Conservative Agents Association and has no doubts about the outcome of a
by-election contest. 'We are confident,' she said. 'The Conservatives in
this constituency have a reputation for being caring and for getting things
done, and I think this will count.'
The constituency is divided between two local councils, Christchurch and
east Dorset. In Christchurch the Conservatives have a majority of only one,
but the opposition is divided between a 'rainbow alliance' of independents
with no cohesion or political compatibility. 'It is a Liberal Democrat-free
zone,' said Mrs Jamieson with relish.
The east Dorset part of the constituency could create more problems for the
Conservatives as there are 14 Tory councillors, 14 Liberal Democrats and 2
Independents.
The coastal strip of the constituency is the most heavily populated and has
a high proportion of retired people and pensioners. Further inland, in areas
like Ferndown, West Moors and Verwood, the population is more mixed with a
big influx of younger people in recent years. Dorset as a whole has had one
of the fastest growing populations in the country over the past two decades.
This has put some strains on local government services, especially the
provision of health care for the elderly.
Mr David Fox, Liberal Democrat regional organiser, believes the party will
be able to put up an impressive fight in spite of the failure to capture any
local county council seats. 'We still took 34 per cent of the vote and that
was with a relatively poor organisation, unlike at a by-election,' he said.
Labour, which trailed third with less than 7,000 votes at the general
election, seems certain to be squeezed as at Newbury and faces losing its
deposit.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: 'All an MP should be' - Obituary:
Robert Adley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Robert Adley, the Tory MP for Christchurch who died yesterday, was a
passionate railway enthusiast who memorably warned the government that rail
privatisation would be 'a poll tax on wheels'.
Mr John Major led the tributes to Mr Adley's independence as a backbencher.
The prime minister said Mr Adley was 'persistent in championing the causes
in which he believed', while Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman,
said: 'He was everything that an MP should be.'
Mr Adley himself might have preferred the praise of Major General Lennox
Napier, the chairman of the Central Transport Consultative Committee, a rail
watchdog body, who said his death was an enormous loss to rail users.
'He was a railway buff who understood the importance to Britain of an
efficient network and he canvassed brilliantly to achieve that end,' he
said.
The author of nine books on steam railways, Mr Adley had attracted less
flattering assessments from some fellow Tories, as his longstanding passion
for the railways was channelled into informed and vigorous criticism of the
government's plans to sell off BR's freight business and to inject
private-sector competition into passenger services.
Never a minister himself, his election last year as chairman of the
all-party transport committee at Westminster - despite a government
preference for one of his colleagues - gave him a powerful position from
which to voice his criticisms.
In January his committee produced a damning, if carefully coded, report on
the government's plans for BR, produced in time for the first Commons debate
on the bill. The final report - published late last month - was less
outspoken than had been expected and was more influential because of that.
Not long after it had been agreed, he suffered the heart attack which led to
his death at the age of 58.
During more than 20 years in the House of Commons, Mr Adley's political
causes ranged from passionate and early support for the ANC in South Africa,
to opposition to the government's occasional forays into 'nanny state'-ism.
He also had long-standing interests in the hotel and tourism industries.
In this eclectic assortment, railways were the continuing theme. Only one
other Tory announced his abstention when the rail privatisation bill was
debated by MPs, although several others have expressed vaguer misgivings
both publicly and privately.
Mr Adley's death leaves the unease among Tory backbenchers about the measure
without a clear focus or spokesman.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTOR insurance premiums could rise because of new EC rules restricting the
use of independently produced car components, the Association of British
Insurers said yesterday, Richard Lapper writes.
If introduced as drafted, the EC Design Protection Directive would ban the
use of pattern parts such as bonnets, wings and bumpers, which are usually
cheaper than those produced by motor manufacturers.
The cost of components used in insurance repairs accounts for about half the
Pounds 4bn paid each year in claims.
'We believe the EC proposals are not in the interests of free competition or
beneficial to motorists,' said Mr Mike Jones, ABI chief executive.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Casualty faces a sad reckoning: Contract hopes dashed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CASUALTY among Britain's remaining naval shipyards was inevitable and it
always seemed most likely it would be Swan Hunter.
Two prospects promised to stave off that fate. One was the Ministry of
Defence's decision, after much hesitation, to go ahead with ordering a
purpose-built helicopter carrier. Swan saw itself as the natural candidate
for the job and staked its future on it.
Last night Mr Robin Ashby, PR consultant to Swan until yesterday's
receivership, said its final bid was increased to accommodate additional
features requested by the MoD.
Mr Ashby said both tenders last year were about Pounds 170m, but he believed
that VSEL's final bid was about Pounds 160m, while Swan's was about Pounds
210m.
The other prospect was a link-up under discussion with General Electric
Company, which owns the rival Yarrow Shipbuilders on the Clyde. Negotiations
that could have led to a takeover of Swan were, however, contingent on its
winning the order for the helicopter carrier. Without that Swan had no work
on its books beyond the end of next year.
Nobody in the industry believed UK naval work could continue to sustain four
shipyards. An already inadequate workload has been drastically reduced since
the launching of the government's Options for Change defence review in 1990
 - an expected reduction of about 30 per cent in the fleet of frigates and
destroyers and 50 per cent in submarines.
The cuts affect both the shipyards and the naval refit dockyards of
Devonport and Rosyth, under private management since 1987. The combined
industry supported about 30,000 jobs in the mid-1980s. By the late 1990s
this is expected to be no more than 11,000 or 12,000.
The award of contracts has become an industrial policy by default,
determining the future shape of competition in the industry. Swan suffered a
heavy blow in January last year when Yarrow won a Pounds 400m order for the
latest batch of three Type-23 frigates. Of 13 vessels built or on order,
Yarrow has won nine to Swan's four.
Vosper Thornycroft in Southampton, which made a niche for itself building
glass-fibre mine warfare ships, has succeeded in compensating for a gap in
this business with steel ships for export.
VSEL, the former Vickers yard at Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, is undergoing
severe cuts, having failed until now in its bids for navy surface ship work.
But, even if it faces daunting problems, VSEL has a guaranteed market as
long as the navy wants submarines.
Without firm assurances on future business from the MoD, receivership became
the only option for Swan.
Industry experts say the yard could continue in business with a much smaller
workforce  - less than 1,000 of the present 2,200  - in the hope of securing
export orders in the next 18 months.
Arrangements have to be decided for completing work on the three frigates
now at Swan. The last, HMS Richmond, has just been launched.
Dr Malcolm McIntosh, the MoD's procurement chief, recently told the Commons
defence committee that the Fort George contract had been awarded to Swan in
1987 on political grounds to safeguard jobs. But this week it was clear the
government was not ready to do the same again.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Task force plan for exporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHAMBERS of commerce yesterday announced plans to establish an export
task force to give exporters a greater influence over government policy.
As a first step the task force, which will begin work within the next six
weeks, will review the effectiveness of government and private-sector
support. It will then examine the feasibility of creating a national export
council as a permanent representative of large and small exporters and
export trade organisations.
The initiative was announced at the Association of British Chambers of
Commerce annual conference in Leeds.
The chambers announced plans to take a closer interest in export assistance
for smaller businesses.
They will establish a working party to influence the way the government's
new business advice centres  - 'one-stop shops'  - help exporters and to
co-ordinate the assistance provided by training and enterprise councils,
chambers and local authorities.
The chambers also unveiled plans to improve the quality of training for
export staff.
The Institute of Export helps people working for its professional
qualifications but there was less training for people changing careers and
for exporters at junior executive level, Mr Parsons said.
The association has commissioned the London and Mid-Yorkshire chambers to
develop a national training course leading to the new national vocational
qualification in export trade.
The government is keen to speed up the process of creating 'one-stop shops'
for local business advice, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, said last night. Only six centres qualified in the first round of
applications last month, while nine more won conditional approval. The
government wants to accelerate the three-year programme envisaged for
establishing a national network, Mr Heseltine told the association's
conference dinner.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Union urges workers not to abandon hope: Plea to carry on
working
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A day of bizarre events, it was one of the most extraordinary scenes:
2,000 people, last survivors of a north-east industry which was once supreme
in the world, standing in the driving rain to hear their union leaders urge
them not to give up hope, but to resume work.
Mr Tommy Brennan, regional organiser of the GMB general union, addressed the
workforce beside an empty slipway.
'The membership have given us their full commitment to continue to work
normally in the hope the receiver can attract a buyer, an interested party,
to take on the running of the company,' he said later.
The workforce, he said, was angry. 'But there's a realisation today, most
important of all, that we must keep it going,' he added.
In the Commons Mr John Major, the prime minister, said Swan's tender for a
vital contract was rejected because it was 'many tens of millions of pounds'
above the rival bid.
He expressed regret at the result, but pointed to the measures announced on
Wednesday, including a new enterprise zone. 'It is precisely because we are
concerned about the employment prospects at Tyneside that we announced the
range of measures yesterday,' he said.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the government had
been warned for six months of what was going to happen. By failing to allow
Swan access to European intervention funds to help it move into merchant
shipbuilding, it had denied the yard a future, he said.
Mr Neville Trotter, Tynemouth MP and the only local Tory MP, concentrated on
prospects for new jobs. 'What we have got to do now is co-ordinate our
efforts to ensure that everything possible is done to provide alternative
employment.'
Mr Stephen Byers, Labour MP for Wallsend, said Swan was condemned to
closure. 'It's come about because of a deliberate decision made by the
government. When they talk about the market you should remember the
government is the market because they place the orders,' he said.
Mr Byers said the opposition would lead a half-day debate next Wednesday on
redundancies in the defence industry.

FT  14 MAY 93 / A day in the death of the north-east's last shipyard: Locked
gates herald Swan Hunter's demise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST sign that May 13 1993 might go down in the history books as the
day north-east England's last shipyard went under came soon after 7am.
Subcontractors arriving at Swan Hunter's main Wallsend entrance to continue
fitting out three Type-23 frigates, the last ships on the order book, found
the main gate shutters locked. They were all turned away.
By 9am union leaders were on emergency standby for a meeting with Swan
Hunter's four directors, who led the management buy-out in 1986.
'We're sitting here waiting,' said shop steward Mr Davy Hanson. 'The lads
are still on the ships. We're doing our best to keep the lads going but how
do you keep up morale in this situation?'
By 11am the media were clustered outside the main entrance. Technical staff
had stopped work and were staring out of the windows. Someone suggested the
last frigate should be called HMS Hardship. Nobody laughed.
Management were cloistered in their offices preparing a statement. The union
leaders stood outside the main office. At 11.50am they were called in. By
11.55am, as workers prepared for their usual dash to lunch, banging noises,
then shouts, became audible behind the entrance shutter. The manual
workforce was lining up.
When the shutter rose at noon for lunch it was a shock  - instead of running
up the bank as usual, they trudged out in the rain; most were laden with
toolboxes; many carried plastic bags stuffed with the paraphernalia of a
working life. Word had gone round that the receivers were coming in  - they
were determined that the men in suits would not take their tools.
At 12.10pm Mr Robin Ashby, company press spokesman, emerged on to the
head-office steps to read the statement. Men returning to the yard, having
discovered that the canteen  - run by subcontractors  - was closed, paused
to listen.
'There's that many on the dole  - they're paying off all over,' said
39-year-old welder Mr Michael Scott, a Swan worker for 18 years. The
directors declined to comment, but were occasionally visible inside the
foyer.
The unions called a 2pm mass meeting. Among the men drifting back was fitter
Mr Clive Routledge bearing a handmade sign, Doom Army  - a reference to
Newcastle United's Toon Army chant.
The workforce assembled beside a massive fabrication shed, to hear their
union leaders instruct them to resume work. They received copies of the
company statement. There was no speech by management.
Leaving to return to the Neptune yard, estimator Mr Paul Turner, whose
entire 12-year working life has been at Swan, said the workforce would
support the receivers.
It would show them the commitment it had demonstrated to the privatised
company. 'It's that which has really disappointed everybody,' he said. 'It's
only a management buy-out, it's not a large multinational which has millions
in the coffers.'
In the offices, receivers Price Waterhouse were urgently assessing Swan's
plight. The media drifted away. Mr Davey Hall, district organiser of the
AEEU engineering and electricians union, emerged from a meeting with
management.
'You try to think of one of the saddest days in a whole life of a
community,' he said. 'I think we've reached the bottom today.'

FT  14 MAY 93 / Nissan cuts Primera output as sales fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN, the Japanese carmaker, is being forced to cut output of one of the
two car ranges it produces at its plant at Sunderland in north-east England
in response to falling sales across Europe.
It has also stopped overtime work at the plant.
The line speed of the assembly track for the Nissan Primera large family car
will be slowed next Monday to reduce 1993 output by 15.4 per cent to 110,000
from the 130,000 previously planned.
Primera output totalled 141,800 last year, and under Nissan's revised plan
production of this range will drop this year by more than a fifth.
The reduction will be Nissan's first production cut in the UK since it began
manufacturing cars at Sunderland in 1986. Output of the Primera began there
in May 1990. Nissan was the first of the Japanese carmakers to establish a
car assembly base in Europe, and it is the first to be ensnared in the
recession that has hit all the established car producers in Europe.
New car sales in west Europe in the first four months of this year have
fallen by about 17.6 per cent to 4.15m, according to industry estimates,
although Nissan has outperformed the market.
Its sales in west Europe in the first four months are estimated to have
fallen 12 per cent to 145,000, which has allowed it to raise its market
share to 3.5 per cent from 3.3 per cent in the corresponding period a year
ago.
Nissan said it would seek to make up for the lower Primera output by raising
production at Sunderland of its Micra small car, which was launched late
last year and is in short supply in some markets.
The Japanese carmaker had planned to produce 140,000 Micras this year, its
first full year of production, but has raised the Micra target to 160,000.
It produced 37,200 Micras in the last five months of 1992 from its launch in
August.
About 100 workers have been transferred from the Primera assembly to the
Micra line, and Nissan said that it was seeking to increase productivity in
Micra production by 10 per cent this year.
Nissan said that it was maintaining its plan to increase overall UK
production this year by 51 per cent to 270,000 from 179,000 last year, but
warned that the plan may have to be revised if new car demand across Europe
continues to fall as sharply as in the first four months.
It is facing intensified competition in the large family car segment of the
European market, in particular after the recent launch of the Ford Mondeo to
replace the Sierra.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Fraud denied by car company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLEGATIONS that Nissan Motor Corporation, the Japanese carmaker, was behind
a multi-million-pound tax fraud were denied yesterday at the Old Bailey by a
senior executive from the company.
The claim was made by Mr Michael Sherrard QC, counsel for Mr Michael Hunt, a
director with Nissan UK, the former British car importer, who denies
conspiring to defraud the Inland Revenue of Pounds 97m in corporation tax.
Mr Sherrard suggested that the fraud may have arisen by Nissan Motor
Corporation Carriers (NMCC), the transport subsidiary of the Japanese
carmaker, keeping its freight charges artificially low. Meanwhile, agents
employed to ship the cars charged Nissan UK significantly higher prices.
The 'lion's share' of the difference was then creamed off into other
accounts, including one opened in Switzerland by Mr Friedrich Pannosch, an
Austrian transport consultant, into which huge sums were passed. This was
carried out with the full knowledge of its Japanese parent company (NMC), he
said.
The accusations were denied by Mr Eisuke Kukita, an NMCC manager who ran the
company's European operations in the late 1980s. 'I cannot believe that,' he
replied.
He denied his company's freight charges were significantly lower than normal
market prices, or that they had been artificially reduced.
Mr Kukita agreed that in March 1990, in Oslo, he met Mr Tore Thorsen, a
Norwegian shipping agent, who is also accused by the Inland Revenue of
taking part in the conspiracy. Mr Kukita denied, however, that at that
meeting he was shown a financial breakdown of the alleged fraud, including
details of payments to Mr Pannosch.
Mr Kukita agreed that after an introduction from Mr Thorsen, he and two
other senior Nissan executives met Mr Pannosch in Vienna in April 1990.
He denied the purpose of the meeting was to 'check out' Mr Pannosch because
NMC was soon to end its long-standing franchise deal with Nissan UK. Mr
Pannosch had taken them on a simple weekend sightseeing trip around the
city, Mr Kukita told the court.
They had, however, discussed business, he agreed: 'It happens to be part of
the Japanese make-up, but we find it difficult to talk about anything other
than business,' he said.
The trial continues today.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Ship safety regime attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MILNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHIP classification societies such as Lloyd's Register were criticised
yesterday when Lord Donaldson, chairman of the inquiry into the implications
of January's Braer shipping disaster, questioned the effectiveness of the
ship safety regime, Roger Milne writes.
He said that the 49 societies were inadequately regulated, too numerous and
requested vessel surveys too infrequently.
Mr Gary Beaumont, for Lloyd's Register, conceded that there had been a loss
of confidence in the societies by the underwriters, but blamed low freight
rates and an oversupply of ships for leaving little money to be spent on
maintenance and new construction during the 1980s.
He pointed out that the rate of ship casualties had fallen sharply last
year.
The inquiry also heard that lack of data on accidents and crew deaths is
hampering a full risk assessment of the move to double-hold tankers, led by
the US. The inquiry has heard that tankers with two 'skins' are not
necessarily the safety panacea many believe as they have an increased risk
of explosions.
The inquiry will begin a series of hearings in Scotland next week before
returning to London.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLASGOW should be the location of the army's new centralised personnel
centre, the government announced yesterday, James Buxton writes. Two months
ago there were fears in the Scottish city that the centre, which would have
created 700 new jobs, would go to Stockport, near Manchester, despite
Glasgow having been designated as the army's preferred location in January.
The army, however, intends to locate the centre in the Ministry of Defence's
existing building, rather than occupying a large, recently completed office
building in the city centre which has been standing empty for more than a
year.
The latest recommendation on the centre, which the army wanted to group
together the administration of all army pay and personnel matters, is
subject to consultation and a final decision will be made in July.
Mr Archie Hamilton, armed forces minister, said that the army had decided
that the most economical option was to house the centre in Kentigern House
in Glasgow at a cost of Pounds 6m.
This would be cheaper than occupying a new building in Glasgow at a cost of
Pounds 25m, or taking a building in Stockport which would cost Pounds 15m.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Nadir's Cyprus lawyer rejects obstruction charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KYRENIA, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MENTES Aziz, the lawyer for the Polly Peck companies in northern Cyprus,
yesterday rejected charges that he initially obstructed the administrators,
and criticised them for issuing writs against Mr Asil Nadir and himself.
He claimed that considerable progress had been made until writs were taken
out in 1991 by Mr Christopher Morris of accountants Touche Ross, who is one
of the administrators to Polly Peck.
'We never contested that the companies belonged to the shareholders,' he
said. 'But the administrators' mandate depended on a court order. Had they
(the administrators) been the appointed board of PPI London there would have
been no problem.'
His accusations were strongly denied by Touche Ross in London.
'Our writs were only issued one year after fruitless negotiations had
commenced,' the firm said.
It stressed that the writs covered only the individuals and did not disrupt
the businesses in northern Cyprus, and added: 'They did business in the UK
and should know the requirements and consequences of becoming insolvent.'
There is believed to have been some disagreement between the administrators
over the strategy of issuing writs, although the decision to proceed was
taken with the approval of the Polly Peck creditors' committee.
Mr Aziz launched 23 suits in the local courts to prevent access to the PPI
companies on the island.
The north Cyprus authorities blocked attempts by the administrators to
create two new companies in May 1991 to take control of the Polly Peck
assets in northern Cyprus, with Mr Richard Stone, a joint administrator, and
Mr Nadir as directors.
Polly Peck's four hotels and Sunzest, the fruit export business, were to be
vested in Voyager Leisure. Unipac Packaging Industries, the packaging plant
in Famagusta, was to be renamed Unipac Holdings.
Both companies were to be 99 per cent owned by PPI (Holdings) BV.
It also emerged yesterday that five leading financial institutions in the UK
and the US hired Kroll Associates, the international private investigators,
to examine Mr Nadir and his business empire over a three-year period
beginning in May 1988.
Mr Jules Kroll, the chairman, said yesterday he had advised his clients that
Polly Peck was a 'high-risk' venture.
One of the financial institutions is understood to have broken off its
relations with Mr Nadir, three others cut back their exposure, while a
fourth continued its involvement.
Mr Kroll said that his company had raised concerns about the high level of
profits being made by some of Mr Nadir's fruit packaging operations which it
could not adequately explain.
It is understood that Citibank was one of the banks that asked Kroll to
investigate Mr Nadir, although Mr Kroll refused to comment on this yesterday
other than to confirm that the bank was a client of his. The possibility
that the high profits might have been linked to arms and drugs dealing was
investigated, but no evidence to suppport this was found by Kroll.

FT  14 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Japan facing pressure over market access
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S trade minister, Mr Yoshiri Mori, will come under pressure from his
US and EC counterparts today to breathe new life into the stalled Uruguay
Round by accepting a package of tariff cuts and other 'market access'
measures, write Bernard Simon in Toronto and Nancy Dunne in Washington.
The three trade officials and Canada's Mr Michael Wilson will hold an
all-day meeting in Toronto described by a Canadian official as an 'intensive
working session'.
Both Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and EC Trade
Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan are said to be confident they are close to an
agreement on market access within the framework of the Uruguay Round.
US officials say they have made significant progress in negotiations on
tariff reductions with the EC, and it is now time to 'begin to engage' Japan
and Canada.
Japan, with its Dollars 136bn (Pounds 88.3bn) worldwide trade surplus, has
'a disproportionate responsibility' to contribute to the process of trade
liberalisation, a senior US official said. 'I want to stress the importance
we see in Japan taking an active interest in a major package.'
Tariff reductions  - in most cases to zero  - are sought by the private
sector on paper, wood, non-ferrous metals, beer and other products where
tariff peaks are still significant. Japan will be leaned on to 'cough up'
market openings in financial services, the US official said.

HUNTING Aircraft, the UK aircraft support company, has been chosen by the
Russian Aviastar aircraft manufacturing group to design and build the
interiors for the new Tupolev TU-204 twin jet airliner.
The UK group is also investing in a new Russian aircraft interiors company
called Avinco, to be based at Aviastar's manufacturing complex in Ulyanovsk.
The new Russian company will be owned by Aviastar, Hunting Aircraft and a
subsidiary of Fleming Russia Investment Corporation.
Modern interiors are regarded as essential to Aviastar's efforts to sell the
TU-204 in the west.
The new company would improve the TU-204's marketability and also produce
and sell western certified interior products to the international market
along with Russian certified products for the former Soviet market, said Mr
Victor Mikhailov, Aviastar's director general.
American Airlines yesterday withdrew an unfair competition complaint against
Iberia Air Lines of Spain, AP-DJ reports from Forth Worth, Texas. The
complaint, filed with the US Department of Transportation in February,
alleged that Iberia and Air France were keeping American from selling its
Sabre computer reservations system in Spain and France.

FT  14 MAY 93 / World Trade News: EC will back Russia's Gatt application
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community will back Russia's planned application to join the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which could be lodged as early as
next month, a senior EC official said yesterday, Frances Williams writes.
The official did not expect the application to run into opposition from Gatt
members, though he foresaw hard bargaining on terms of entry.
Russian membership remains some way off. Even in straightforward cases,
negotiations rarely take less than a year.
'They clearly are trying to move towards a market economy system and an
appropriate trade regime, but equally clearly they have not by any means got
there yet,' he said. Gatt members would have to judge whether Russia could
be accommodated as an ordinary market economy or whether, 'in a transitional
phase', it would have to have a specially tailored protocol of accession.
The US said in April it would back Russian membership of Gatt. Russia has
had observer status since May 1990 and has subsequently become an observer
on five of Gatt's voluntary codes of fair trade practice, including those on
standards and anti-dumping. Thirteen other former Soviet republics are also
Gatt observers, traditionally a first step to membership.
The EC official said he expected Russia's Gatt application to give a boost
to bilateral negotiations between Brussels and Moscow on a so-called
'partnership' accord.

FT  14 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Dunkel warns on Uruguay Round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Arthur Dunkel, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, yesterday warned that escalation of trade frictions could poison the
Uruguay Round negotiations due to conclude this year.
In a report to Gatt's 110 members on developments in the trading system, he
said bringing the round to a successful conclusion in 1993 was the only way
to end the uncertainty surrounding trade relations since the failure to
conclude the negotiations on schedule in December 1990.
Mr Dunkel's report highlights a growing number of bilateral disagreements
including disputes involving anti-dumping and anti-subsidy action which is
increasingly seen as protectionist in both intent and effect.
Gatt's main worries relate to non-implementation of dispute panel reports
and unilateral measures by those involved in disputes, notably the US. These
put the multilateral trading system at risk and damage its credibility, the
report says.
Other disturbing policy developments include a sharp increase in
anti-dumping actions, especially by developing countries, and the continued
maintenance of quantitative restrictions outside Gatt rules. In addition to
127 restraints affecting trade in textiles and clothing, Gatt lists 79
'voluntary export restraints' and other bilaterally agreed or unilaterally
imposed measures.
On the positive side, 18 countries have joined Gatt since the Uruguay Round
began in 1986, with more in the queue, while 72 countries have announced
unilateral trade liberalisation measures over the period.
Mr Balkrishan Zutshi, chairman of Gatt's members, said yesterday he hoped
for a decision on the successor to Mr Dunkel, who retires at the end of
June, 'as soon as possible or at least by the end of the month'. Officials
say Mr Peter Sutherland, former EC competition commissioner nominated by
Dublin with EC support, remains the front-runner.

FT  14 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Paris on attack over Gatt - French farmers
'not the one stumbling block' to trade deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday launched its diplomatic counter-offensive in the Gatt trade
talks to remind its European Community partners of an array of common
European demands in the negotiations, outside of agriculture where Paris is
most isolated.
In a statement to fellow EC leaders on Wednesday Prime Minister Edouard
Balladur has brought France out of its defensive agricultural trench and
engaged its negotiating opponents - first inside the EC, then among the
other Gatt participants - on a wide front.
The European Commission issued a cautious initial reaction to the memorandum
yesterday, describing it as a 'carefully worded' and 'useful' contribution
to the EC's reflections on the Gatt talks. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade
commissioner, will discuss the paper with Mr Balladur and French ministers
at meetings in Paris on Monday.
Mr Balladur said: 'I want to put an end to this idea that several hundreds
of thousands of French farmers are the one stumbling block to the
regeneration of world trade that would follow from a Gatt accord.'
Many other issues in the 14 non-agricultural sectors of the Gatt
negotiations needed to be settled, he added. If they were, he hinted he
might be ready to face his farmers down on certain of their demands. There
is a strong impression that Paris is preparing to join other EC countries
soon in endorsing the draft oilseeds accord with the US, an issue
technically outside the Uruguay Round, provided it gets a few more
modifications.
'Nothing is worse (in a negotiation) than to get stuck in generalities,'
said Mr Balladur, hailing his government's five-page position paper as a
'concrete and complete' review of everything from tariffs, copyright to
world labour standards. But it is largely a re-packaging of existing French
and EC positions to revive public interest in them.
France is also calling for the EC to defend itself commercially against
unfair trade, not only with its anti-dumping/subsidy rules but also with its
so-called New Commercial Instrument. Approved in 1984, this was designed as
Europe's answer to unilateral retaliation provided for in Section 301 of
successive US Trade Acts. The EC Twelve have hardly ever been able to agree
on its use.
However, France does endorse the EC's long-held view that the Uruguay Round
should end by replacing Gatt with a stronger World Trade Organisation, which
would outlaw unilateral trade retaliation. So, talk of the Community
reviving the New Commercial Instrument is largely a negotiating chip with
Washington. Mr Gerard Longuet, the trade and industry minister, admitted
there was 'a hierarchy' among French demands, conceding effectively that
some were just bargaining counters.
The clear impression is that France is at last open for business on Gatt -
but that negotiating will be tough.

FT  14 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Accountants argue for wider access to
global business - An accord is being sought as part of a broader services
deal under Uruguay Round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIALS representing more than a million accountants in 80 countries were
in Geneva last week to persuade trade negotiators to make it easier for
accountants to practise abroad.
Big accountancy firms such as Arthur Andersen or Coopers &amp; Lybrand operate
on a worldwide basis, earn gross fees of billions of dollars a year and
employ tens of thousands of staff. Yet they still face significant barriers
in overseas operations.
The officials representing the profession argue that an accord, which would
form part of a broader services agreement in the Uruguay Round of trade
liberalising talks, is needed to enable accountancy to catch up with the
globalisation of business.
Barriers to foreign accountants include bans on the use of foreign
professional titles and on forming partnerships with local firms,
limitations on the number of partners in a firm, 'scope of practice'
limitations, difficulty in obtaining 'audit firm' status, bans on the use of
international firm names and other marketing restrictions, and the refusal
to grant foreign accountants local professional certification.
National differences in accounting standards and practices also impair free
movement of capital and make the job of accountants - and national
regulators supervising multinational companies - more difficult and costly.
A draft framework General Agreement on Trade in Services (Gats) encourages
the mutual recognition of professional qualifications and the adoption of
harmonised standards for all types of services. But the accountancy
organisations, which include the Federation des Experts Comptables
Europeens, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the
International Accounting Standards Committee and the International
Federation of Accountants, want to give the general rules more bite by
committing governments to apply them in the accountancy field.
They are pressing for an agreement on accountancy which would aim to promote
the mutual recognition and harmonisation of professional qualifications
across borders, stimulate development and use of international accounting
standards, and require governments to begin opening their accountancy
sectors to foreign competition.
'We believe the services agreement can go beyond its present limited
objectives to achieve a real breakthrough in our profession - one that will
have widespread benefits well beyond accountancy,' says Mr John Hegarty,
secretary general of the Brussels-based FEE, the umbrella body for European
accountants.
The FEE and others argue that widespread use of international accounting
standards would make it easier for regulators and accountants to follow
complicated financial statements and transactions by international
businesses.
Their draft accord would commit all countries to include accounting and
related services in their liberalisation schedules for services, and to
remove restrictions that insist on citizenship or continuous prior
residence, limit a firm's name, or require certified professionals to study
at specified institutions.
The proposed agreement would also lay down specific procedures for granting
non-nationals certification to practise, based on mutual recognition of
professional qualifications and competence supplemented by tailored
examinations to plug the gaps. This is the system already adopted by the EC
for free movement of accountants within the single market.
Last, the draft accord would commit governments to review formally and
consider the adoption of international accounting standards as the basis of
their financial disclosure and reporting requirements, though it would leave
the final decision to national authorities.
'We recognise that international accounting standards are not yet at a stage
where wholesale adoption by governments is feasible,' says Mr David Cairns,
secretary general of the London-based IASC. 'But the services agreement
could stimulate greater international co-operation . . . by recognising the
role of the IASC and encouraging regulators to work with us.'
Its proponents argue that a sectoral agreement would speed worldwide
liberalisation of the accountancy profession without the need for
time-consuming bilateral negotiations, and would offer a model for other
professions and services.
It seems clear, however, that they will have to settle for something less
than the formal annex to the framework Gats at first proposed. At the
meeting in Geneva on May 5, trade negotiators from 18 nations (including the
EC and US) showed themselves sympathetic to the basic ideas but were
generally doubtful on the virtues of an annex.
Officials said countries did not want to set in concrete specific
commitments to liberalise accountancy, which is just one of more than 100
commercial services identified by the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
Instead, they favoured a more flexible solution, perhaps by way of a
ministerial declaration alongside the Uruguay Round package of accords.
Mr Charles Heeter, a principal with Arthur Andersen and chairman of the
AICPA's taskforce on international trade agreements, says the accountancy
organisations are prepared to be flexible on procedures but want a mechanism
for more rapid liberalisation than the Gats alone would provide.

FT  14 MAY 93 / UK warns on unitary tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, confirmed yesterday
that the government would retaliate against US companies unless the dispute
over California's unitary system for taxing foreign companies was resolved
by the end of this year.
Mr Lamont said that following his meeting last month with Mr Lloyd Bentsen,
the US Treasury secretary, he had been assured that the US administration
was very keen 'to find a solution to the problem that is acceptable'.
But to underline the seriousness with which the UK government was treating
the issue, Mr Lamont said he had told the Inland Revenue to get information
from California-based companies in the UK on the probable impact of
cancelling the tax break given to US companies on the dividends they receive
from their British subsidiaries.
Sir Michael Grylls, chairman of the Tory backbench trade and industry
committee, welcomed Mr Lamont's decision and emphasised the strong political
support there was from MPs of all parties for retaliation if it was needed.
'President Clinton has totally disregarded the US's international
commitments and, unfortunately, US business will now have to pay a very real
and high price,' he said.
The US Supreme Court is expected to decide today whether to hear a case
brought by Barclays Bank, the UK clearing bank, against the Californian
system. In a break with the policy of previous US administrations, Mr
Clinton this month decided not to file a brief on Barclays' side.
Under the unitary system California may assess taxes on companies not on the
profits they actually make in the state, but on a proportion of their
worldwide earnings.
It will be very simple and quick for the UK government to launch retaliatory
action.
In direct response to the Barclays case, it inserted a clause in the 1988
Income and Corporation Taxes act designed to remove tax credits from
non-resident companies connected with states where the unitary system is
employed .
Parliament would simply need to approve a statutory instrument to bring this
into effect. Alternatively, more detailed measures could be introduced into
the new Finance Bill following the next budget in November.
Mr Peter Parsons, a tax partner with accountants Touche Ross, said: 'This is
something that we've all been expecting and hoping for. It is entirely
appropriate.
'The US is not going to listen unless some specific measures are taken. The
numbers involved will impact quite significantly back at head office in
California.'
The US Treasury said the administration would 'work with California in
trying to address the concerns the UK government has raised.'

FT  14 MAY 93 / US consumer prices up: Rise prompts share and bond sales on
fears that inflationary pressures are reviving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPORTS of a sharp increase in US consumer prices last month prompted heavy
selling of shares and bonds yesterday on fears that US inflationary
pressures are reviving.
The Labour Department said the consumer price index rose 0.4 per cent
between March and April and at an annual rate of 3.7 per cent over the last
quarter. On Wednesday it reported a 0.6 per cent rise in producer prices
last month.
In late trading the benchmark long bond was down 1 5/32 at 102 7/32 to yield
6.944 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 34.32 points lower
at 3,447.99.
'There's no cause for long-term concern,' President Bill Clinton told
reporters, but 'we have to watch it.'
The figures puzzled many analysts because consumer demand is seen as too
weak to support a significant acceleration of inflation. Wage costs remain
subdued.
Consumer prices were boosted last month by an erratic rise in food prices.
However, the 'core' consumer price index  - which excludes food and energy
 -rose 0.4 per cent and at an annual rate of 4.1 per cent over the past
three months. Core producer prices have also risen rapidly in recent months.
'Inflation will stabilise at 3-3.5 per cent this year,' said Mr David Wyss,
chief economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, a forecasting group. 'Hopes that it
would fall to 2.5-3.0 per cent were always unrealistic.'
Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers in New York, said the
figures seemed 'a bit high given the modest pace of growth'.
Separately, the Commerce Department reported a 1.2 per cent increase in
retail sales last month, a stronger than expected rebound after bad weather
hit sales in March. The recovery was led by car sales, which rose 3 per cent
from March.
Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, warned that the sales rebound was modest
and indicated an annual rate of sales growth of only 2.4 per cent, lower
than the rate of inflation. A 12 per cent increase in car sales compared
with April last year, however, was evidence that 'the president's
cut-the-deficit, lower interest rate strategy is setting the stage for
growth.'
Mr Wyss predicted a 'soft' second quarter with economic growth at an annual
rate of 2.5 per cent, up from 1.8 per cent in the first quarter. The
recovery, however, would gather momentum in the second half of the year.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Monet sells in NY for Dollars 9.7m

<TEXT>
A LARGE marine painting by Claude Monet, completed in 1868 when the
28-year-old artist was living with his aunt on the Normandy coast, sold for
Dollars 9.68m (Pounds 6.3m) at Christie's in New York on Wednesday night,
Antony Thorncroft writes. 'Jetty at Havre' was sent for sale by the Japanese
inventor Motoaki Ishizuka and bought by a private European collector.
The price was near the high end of Christie's pre-sale estimate and set the
seal on a very successful auction: 48 of the 60 lots of impressionist and
modern art on offer found buyers, for a total of Dollars 48.5m and in terms
of value the auction was almost 90 per cent sold.
Taken with Sotheby's success on Tuesday in selling a Cezanne for Dollars
28.6m and a Matisse for Dollars 14.3m it confirmed that buyers have returned
at the top end of the international art market.
Two pastels of dancers by Degas also sold well. A late work, 'Danseuses
Russes', based on the visit of a troupe of Russian folk dancers to the
Folies-Bergere in 1895, made Dollars 6.27m, almost double its estimate, and
'Deux danseuses au foyer', two gossiping girls, also beat its target at
Dollars 2.6m.
The tide started to turn for impressionist and modern paintings at the
December auctions in New York.

<TEXT>
THE Mexican government has reacted with relief to reports that the new US
ambassador to Mexico will be Mr James R. Jones, chairman of the American
Stock Exchange and a former politician with good contacts in the US
Congress.
The government and US officials believe Mr Jones has influence on Capitol
Hill that should be helpful in the run-up to the vote on the North American
Free Trade Agreement, expected this year. Mr Jones was a Democratic
congressman for 14 years, chairman of the powerful budget committee for four
years, and before that a top aide in the Johnson White House.
A senior Mexican official said: 'He is a very adequate person for the
circumstances. He has a long relation with Congress, is close to Clinton and
knows about trade between Mexico and US. All the opinions have been very
favourable.'
A US official added that Mr Jones 'would send a strong positive signal to
Mexico about Nafta and bilateral relations if nominated and confirmed.'
During his presidency of the American Stock Exchange, the US's third largest
exchange, Mr Jones introduced a series of innovative trading instruments
that helped to make up for a slowdown in traditional equity trading
business. Foreign currency warrants were especially successful.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Past crises haunt last lap of Salinas term: Mexico's
president gambles on Nafta to beat current account deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospect of a financial or political crisis haunts the last leg of
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's six-year term. After all, the
last three presidential terms ended disastrously with steep devaluations,
debt defaults or street protests against electoral fraud.
While an outright political or economic crisis such as those of previous
years seems unlikely, many are already predicting an awkward and difficult
time before elections in September next year.
Observers point to the instability associated with the transition from one
all-powerful president to another. With the president exercising such power,
rumours and speculation over the succession can easily rattle financial
markets and make powerful interest groups tremble at the prospect of policy
shifts.
Perhaps above all, analysts worry about the huge gamble the president has
taken in betting so much on the North American Free Trade Agreement. Were it
to be rejected by the US Congress in the vote scheduled for later this year,
investors might be unwilling to finance Mexico's huge current account
deficit, possibly provoking a devaluation.
The pro-US, so-called technocrat wing of the ruling party would also suffer
a setback, while the nationalist wing, and hitherto divided and weak
opposition parties would receive a boost.
The government is arguing things are different this time. 'The vicious
circle of debt, budget deficits and inflation has been broken,' says
Guillermo Ortiz, under-secretary of finance. With debt down to a manageable
28 per cent of gross domestic product from 62 per cent in 1988, public
finances in surplus, and inflation nearly at single digits, the economy is
less vulnerable to sudden shocks, he argues.
Officials deny the rejection of Nafta would lead to any significant reversal
in policy - although it might make the political situation more unstable. On
the contrary, says one government minister, Nafta would put pressure on the
government to push ahead with more economic reforms as a way of reassuring
financial markets that the country's economic strategy had not changed.
Were Nafta delayed, or called off, the question of the succession would loom
even larger than in the past, as Mexicans and foreigners alike speculate
over the likely reaction in Mexico to the US rejection of the treaty.
The concern is particularly acute because traditionally Mexican presidents
lose some control over the political process as in-fighting over the
succession rises, and attention begins to shift to the next presidential
term. While far from his being a lame duck, there are nonetheless some signs
that President Salinas is losing his once steady political touch.
In February the president was forced to back down on a scheme to solicit
Dollars 25m from the country's 30 wealthiest businessmen for the ruling PRI
party in the face of intense domestic and international criticism of
business's generous donations.
'Three years ago Mr Salinas would have got away with raising such large
sums,' says Mr Federico Estevez, a professor of political science at the
Instituto del Tecnologia Autonomia de Mexico, 'but now his control is
slipping.'
More recently the government has had to back down on a plan to postpone
elections for governor in the opposition stronghold of Yucatan, after
vehement local and national protests.
The government's vulnerability is heightened by the delicate state of the
economy. It has been forced to let interest rates rise to 8 per cent in real
terms and run a budget surplus to slow import growth and try to counter a
current account deficit expected to be Dollars 25bn this year. This is
expected to cut economic growth to 2 per cent this year from 2.6 per cent
last.
The Salinas administration is keen to encourage growth to accelerate by the
time of the elections next year. It is thus banking heavily that Nafta will
attract to Mexico more direct foreign investment, and thus allow lower
interest rates and more government spending without endangering the exchange
rate.
But while the anxiousness of the government is palpable, a serious crisis in
the economy or sudden reversal in policy still seem improbable.
Mr Miguel Basanez, head of the polling organisation Mori of Mexico, and
often a critic of the government, puts the odds of a political or economic
crisis at no more than 10 per cent.
'Things are still under control, the president is popular, and the economic
team and policy is better than in the past,' he says.
The Mexican government has fought hard for macro-economic stability, and the
consensus is that President Salinas will not throw everything away in a fit
of pique at the US.
Mr Pedro Aspe, Mexico's finance minister, says: 'Fiscal and monetary policy
has been exactly the same in 1989, '90, '91, '92, '93 and it will be exactly
the same in 1994. We do not use stop-go (policies).'
The government also has more than Dollars 20bn in foreign reserves as a
cushion against sudden outflows of capital.
Similarly, the succession itself is not likely to throw up any surprises.
All the favoured candidates from within the ruling party worked under Mr
Salinas in the budget ministry in the mid-1980s, share broadly his economic
vision and studied economics or public administration at US universities.
Even Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the head of the leftist Party of Democratic
Revolution, and who as an independent candidate came close to beating Mr
Salinas in the disputed presidential election of 1988, says were he elected
president he would not take Mexico back to its protectionist, inward-looking
past.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Compromise reached on Clinton tax plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEMOCRATS on the US Congress's main tax committee have agreed to make
significant alterations to some of President Bill Clinton's tax proposals
but to preserve the broad outlines of his plan.
The compromise bill agreed by the House of Representatives Ways and Means
Committee still faces a rough passage in the full House and an even bumpier
ride in the Senate. It will make a smaller increase in the corporate tax
rate than Mr Clinton had proposed and allow substantial exemptions to the
new energy tax that is to be assessed on the thermal content of fuels.
But Mr Clinton welcomed the new bill, brokered by Mr Dan Rostenkowski, the
Illinois Democrat who chairs the Ways and Means committee. He said the
changes did not 'reduce the overall contribution from the business sector,
they just shifted the way it comes.'
As expected, Mr Rostenkowski's compromise would increase the corporate tax
rate from 34 to 35 per cent, rather than 36 per cent as Mr Clinton had
requested, but would abandon the administration's proposal for an investment
tax credit.
It will also abandon the administration's plan for new regulations that
would increase the rate of taxation on foreign royalty income.
After giving way to farmers and airlines over some elements of the energy
tax, the administration will also have to give ground to the aluminium
industry, a heavy user of electricity which has won an exemption from the
tax.
The bill preserves the largest component of Mr Clinton's plan, an increase
in the income tax rates on the wealthiest 2 per cent of taxpayers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Eliseu Resende, Brazil's finance minister, remained in office yesterday
after being questioned in the Senate on Wednesday about alleged favours from
the ministry to his former employer.
The consensus among legislators was that Mr Resende emerged strengthened
from the session. Senators queried him over proposed loans for Peru and
Ecuador which have been earmarked to finance construction work by Norberto
Odebrecht, the construction company where Mr Resende worked from 1983 to
1990. Mr Resende maintains that the loan approval was routine.
Before the session ended, President Itamar Franco released a message of
confidence in Mr Resende through his press secretary.
However, a presidential press release that was expected after the senate
session was not distributed, leading to speculation that Mr Resende's future
may still be in doubt.
If he is replaced, his successor would be the country's fourth finance
minister in less than eight months. These shuffles are believed to be
stalling progress in talks with the International Monetary Fund.
A wider shake-up of Mr Franco's government may be forthcoming. Ms Yeda
Crusius resigned as planning minister last week after expressing irritation
over the limited role she was allowed in preparing the government's economic
recovery programme.

FT  14 MAY 93 / New town ignites Singapore 'China fever'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEADLONG rush by Singapore companies to invest in China has entered a
new phase with the signing of an agreement between the Singapore authorities
and the Chinese to develop an industrial township in Suzhou, near Shanghai.
The agreement proposes developing a 70 sq km new town  - already called
'Singapore II' by the Singapore press - using Singapore's integrated
planning approach as a model. The hope is to attract USDollars 20bn (Pounds
12.9bn) of investment in the new town, which will eventually have a
population of more than 600,000.
Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's senior minister, who was present at a signing
ceremony is Suzhou, said Singapore would transfer its planning expertise and
knowhow to the Chinese. In the process Singapore could make the connections
vital to winning contracts.
'If we transfer this asset over seven to 10 years, it will be useful to them
and in the process we will get to know them well at different levels. . .
that's the trade-off,' he said.
Under the terms of the preliminary agreement the Singapore Labour
Foundation, a quasi-state body, and the Suzhou municipal government will put
together a consortium of companies to work on the new town. 'It is a
microcosm of what we've been doing in Singapore,' said Mr Lee.
The Sembawang group of Singapore has meanwhile signed an deal with the
Suzhou authorities to build power plants capable of producing 2,400
megawatts of electricity. Suzhou is part of Jiangsu province, China's
fastest growing economic region.
A Singapore-based analyst said the Suzhou town project could mean
multi-million dollar contracts for Singapore companies. 'But things are
never simple in China. In the past agreements have been signed but nothing
has come of them  - it's going to be a time before we know just how much the
deal is worth,' Mr Lee said.
'China fever' has been rampant in Singapore since Mr Lee made a highly
publicised trip to China last year. He returned to chastise Singaporeans for
their lack of entrepreneurial zeal and urge the island republic's companies
to follow the example of their counterparts in Hong Kong and Taiwan and
invest more in China.
Mrs Wu Yi, China's minister for foreign trade and economic co-operation,
told a trade seminar this week in Singapore that in 1992 Singapore companies
became involved in more than 700 projects in China with a total investment
value of Dollars 997m. This compared to total Singapore investments in China
of Dollars 897m over the entire 1979-91 period.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NINTH round of Middle East peace negotiations ended without any sign of
progress yesterday after the first direct US attempt to bridge differences
had been rebuffed by the Palestine Liberation Organisation. No date has yet
been set for a resumption.
Mr Yasser Abed Rabbo, a member of the PLO executive committee, said a US
document, submitted late on Wednesday, openly sided with Israel and was 'a
dangerous step' in the peace process.
The Palestinian negotiators in Washington refused to attend the meeting with
US and Israeli officials at which the US compromise formula was presented.
Mr Abed Rabbo claimed the US document had been agreed in advance with the
Israelis. 'It was an Israeli document to which the Americans had given
another name,' he said.
The Israeli delegation said it also had reservations about the US draft
document, which was being studied in Jerusalem.
The US proposals, which seek to find common ground on a statement of general
principles covering interim self-government for the Palestinians in the
occupied territories, were later delivered to the Palestinians. A senior
member of the Palestinian delegation said that the document had not been
rejected out of hand.
State Department officials stressed that the proposals were further evidence
of the US commitment to become a 'full partner' in the peace process, as
promised by President Bill Clinton. It is the first time since the Madrid
conference 18 months ago that the US had presented proposals on substantive
issues.
The ninth round of negotiations, which opened more than two weeks ago after
a gap of four months, was already bogged down over Palestinian accusations
that Israel and the US had reneged on promises made to bring them back to
the negotiating table. At the weekend the Palestinians reduced their
negotiating team from 14 to three and halted work on three sub-committees.
They cited killings of Palestinians by Israeli troops and worsening economic
conditions in the West Bank and Gaza caused by sealing off the territories,
as evidence of Israeli bad faith. Those members of the Palestinian
delegation most concerned at erosion of support at home are openly sceptical
about the value of continuing the talks.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Taipei to constrain mainland investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TAIWANESE government is seeking to slow the island's rapid corporate
expansion into the Communist mainland by placing restrictions on listed
companies' activities in China.
This is Taipei's first move to constrain investment flows across the Taiwan
straits since it lifted travel restrictions in 1987.
Under current regulations, Taiwanese companies are permitted to invest in a
large number of mainstream business activities in China, but only via a
third country.
However, the Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC), which regulates the
Taipei stock market, yesterday announced it will prohibit companies from
raising capital on the stock market to fund China projects. Listed companies
will also be required to gain shareholders' approval for any investments in
the mainland.
The SEC said the decision was in line with current government policy.
However, brokers said it would have a very limited effect on listed
companies, which can easily restructure financing for China projects. It is
estimated that close to 20 per cent of the Taipei stock market's 260
companies have already announced investments in China.
The government estimates that around 4,000 of the island's companies have
invested USDollars 3.5bn in China, while unofficial estimates suggest the
figure is more than USDollars 7bn.
Given the strengthened economic links between the two enemies, there has
been increasing pressure from Taiwan's business community to lift
prohibitions on direct transport, investment and postal links across the
Taiwan straits. Last month, China raised the issue of the 'three links',
when the two sides met for the first time since 1949 at the Koo-Wang talks
in Singapore. But Taiwan remains anxious to retain what a government
spokesman admitted was a 'political pawn'.

FT  14 MAY 93 / WHO to give bigger Aids role to other UN agencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Health Organisation is to examine how the United Nations system
can tackle Aids more effectively, a move likely to see other UN agencies
taking a bigger role in combating the worldwide epidemic.
WHO members are expected to approve today a resolution calling for a study
into the benefits of a joint UN programme on Aids. The resolution has been
sponsored by 34 rich and poor countries, including the US, Britain and
Japan.
Dr Michael Merson, head of the WHO's global Aids programme, said yesterday
that the goal of the study would be to identify how to use existing
financial and human resources most effectively, how to raise new resources
and how best to apply 'what we know'.
This meant education for safer sex and the treatment of other sexually
transmitted diseases which increased the risk of Aids. Dr Merson said about
15 experimental vaccines were undergoing safety trials but he added: 'I
don't think we will have a vaccine for prevention of HIV (the virus that
causes Aids) or Aids before the end of the decade.'
The WHO says some 13m people in the world have been infected with the HIV
virus and this could rise to between 30m and 40m by 2000. The resources
needed to tackle the pandemic effectively are huge. Dr Merson said the cost
of preventive work in developing countries was an estimated Dollars 2.9bn
(Pounds 1.9bn) a year. The WHO global Aids programme has an annual budget of
about Dollars 85m.
The other agencies involved in the study, which will be presented to the
WHO's executive board next January, are the UN Development Programme, the UN
Children's Fund (Unicef), the UN Population Fund, the UN Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) and the World Bank.
WHO officials say they fully back the study, and expect the world health
body to take a leading role in any joint UN Aids programme. But the loss or
erosion of its flagship programme will be seen by some as a further blow to
the organisation's prestige, following the damaging row surrounding last
week's re-election of WHO's director-general, Dr Hiroshi Nakajima.
The 93 to 58 vote by the World Health Assembly to confirm Dr Nakajima in
office for a second five-year term showed a high degree of support for
Western criticism of Dr Nakajima's leadership and concern over the findings
of an external audit revealing financial irregularities in contracts for
executive board members. The two-week assembly ends today.

<TEXT>
THE CLINTON administration has pledged to write off a small portion of
African debt, in a departure from the hostility to debt forgiveness of
preceeding Republican administrations, writes Leslie Crawford.
Up to now, the US was the only leading industrial country to refuse to
cancel official debt when African countries came to the Paris Club of
creditor nations for debt reschedulings.
Mr Lawrence Summers, US under-secretary for international affairs, told an
African Development Bank meeting in Abidjan the new policy was 'a valuable
first step'.
He earlier told a US congressional committee that with an investment of only
Dollars 14m (Pounds 9m) over the next two fiscal years, the US could erase
Dollars 228m in debt for as many as 18 of the poorest countries, most of
them located in sub-Saharan Africa. Although the initiative is expected to
win congressional approval, it will only make a small dent in the Dollars
255bn Africa owes its donors.

FT  14 MAY 93 / China puts the brake on rapid economic growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA yesterday gave the clearest indication yet of its worries about
too-rapid growth and indicated the steps it is taking to slow down the
economy.
Mr Zhu Rongji, the vice premier who has additional duties during the absence
due to ill health of premier Li Peng, told foreign ex-heads of government
meeting in Shanghai that worry about overheating was 'understandable, and it
is also a major concern to myself.'
'Over the past six months, industrial growth has been too fast, investment
has heated up, inflationary pressures gradually accumulated, financial and
monetary markets grown tight, and disparity between regions in terms of
economic development widened,' Mr Zhu said.
'Indeed, there is a danger of macro-economic imbalance. Although these
phenomena are not yet uncontrollable or unbearable, the Chinese government
pays great attention to them.'
'Since the beginning of this year, we have adopted rather prudent fiscal and
monetary policies. Meanwhile, we will adjust the intensity in the
implementation of our macro-economic policies whenever required by the
economic situation.'
Mr Zhu said growth would be at least 10 per cent this year, compared with
12.8 per cent in 1992.
Foreign economists said there was evidence that a squeeze on credit was
already having an effect. Mr Hugh Peyman, regional strategist for Asian
Capital Partners in Singapore, said foreign companies are being asked for
capital by their Chinese joint venture partners.
He forecast that growth would drop to a 5.5 per cent annual rate by the
second quarter of 1994 - though it would quickly rebound - and that
inflation would rise to 13 per cent in the third quarter of this year
compared with 8.6 per cent in the first quarter.

<TEXT>
MR VO Van Kiet, the Vietnamese prime minister, arrived in Seoul yesterday on
a four-day visit to seek Korean investment. He is the most senior Vietnamese
official to visit South Korea since the two countries established relations
last December.
Korea is already the sixth largest foreign investor in Vietnam, with Dollars
343m.
Besides signing agreements on trade and investment guarantees, Mr Vo Van
Kiet will tour the industrial facilities of Korea's biggest conglomerates.
Korean investment in Vietnam is expected to increase once the US lifts
economic sanctions against Hanoi, which will permit international financial
institutions such as the World Bank to provide credit for infrastructure
projects.
Korea's big construction companies, including Hyundai, are seeking contracts
to build or repair roads and port facilities.
Meanwhile, joint ventures are being established. Pohang Iron and Steel
(Posco) is building two steel facilities in Vietnam and it announced
yesterday it would build an agrochemical plant in co-operation with Daewoo,
another Korean conglomerate. Samsung wants to set up fertiliser and
containers factories.
Daewoo has signed contracts for a Dollars 60m hotel, a truck assembly plant
and TV picture tube plant. and Lucky-Goldstar is installing
telecommunications systems. Mr Qian Qichen, the Chinese foreign minister,
will hold discussions in Seoul next week on resolving the North Korea
nuclear problem.
South Korea is relying on China to help persuade Pyongyang to reverse its
decision on withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT),
which takes effect on June 12.
It is still uncertain whether China will support economic sanctions against
Pyongyang if it leaves the NPT.

FT  14 MAY 93 / India asks IMF for three-year support

<TEXT>
INDIA, which is in the middle of wide-ranging economic reforms, plans to ask
the International Monetary Fund to support its programme for a further three
years.
India has been borrowing from the Fund to help finance its external account
under a two-year stand-by arrangement which expires this month. Indian
officials plan to negotiate a three-year loan under the IMF's Extended Fund
Facility - a medium-term programme designed to finance structural change.
Indian officials secured broad agreement from the IMF for the three-year
scheme earlier this month, during the annual spring meeting of the IMF and
the World Bank in Washington, where Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, met
Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director.
However, detailed negotiations over the terms of the new loan will not begin
until July or August this year.
India has so far fulfilled most of the conditions imposed by the IMF on
loans taken since the start of economic reform in mid-1991. These included
cuts in government borrowing, financial deregulation and reductions in
import barriers. However, the IMF's economists believe more needs to be done
 -such as further reductions in government borrowing, changes in labour law
and banking reform.
Reform-minded Indian officials accept that much more must be done fully to
liberalise the Indian economy. But there is strong political opposition to
some proposed reforms - such as curbing subsidised bank loans to state
industries and to farmers, and increasing em-ployers' rights to sack
workers.
Before the visit to Washington, Indian officials hinted that they may delay
negotiating the new three-year programme because the country's foreign
reserves are about USDollars 1bn higher than expected at just under Dollars
7bn.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Japan irked by rejection of whale plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A JAPANESE request for a harvest of 50 whales in its coastal waters was
rejected yesterday by member nations of the International Whaling
Commission, which are still deeply divided over a controversial proposal for
a sanctuary in the southern oceans.
Japanese officials again threatened that the country would leave the IWC if
it continues to rule against a limited resumption of commercial whaling,
while the commission has virtually split into two camps and is unable to
agree on when to discuss sensitive issues, let alone to agree on decisions.
A majority of the 34 nations represented at the IWC's annual meeting in
Kyoto supported a resolution condemning the 'research' whaling programmes of
Norway and Japan, which last year caught 330 minke whales in the Antarctic
region. The vote annoyed Japanese representatives, who argue that the
research is necessary to ensure the health of the whale population.
Japanese officials were also unhappy that a majority of nations voted
against the quota of 50 whales under a scheme known as community-based
whaling. Tokyo had hoped to win approval for the concept of community
whaling, which, it says, would involve the local consumption of whale
products and not commercial sales.
But in spite of the setbacks, and the threats to leave the IWC, UK and US
officials expect that Japan will remain in the commission, as it would be a
loss of face for the country to withdraw when hosting the annual meeting.
Tokyo is also known to be wary of irritating the US government, which is
taking a strong line on environmental issues.
The commission's meeting is due to end today, and its reputation will suffer
if member countries are unable to agree to vote on the sanctuary proposal or
on a management scheme for whale stocks, supposed to be concluded at this
gathering.
Five nations, including Brazil and Sweden, proposed that the sanctuary vote
be deferred for a year, but supports of the sanctuary, which would last for
50 years and be reviewed after 10 years, are still pushing for vote even
though they are certain not to get the three-quarters majority required.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Success of Yemeni elections prompts worries for Saudis:
Riyadh sees dangers in possible rise of a democratic neighbour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARRIVAL in Sana'a this week of senior envoys from the US and Saudi
Arabia has underscored the growing international significance attached to
the successful outcome of Yemen's April 27 elections.
As the first multi-party poll ever held in the Arabian peninsula, the Yemeni
elections have been viewed as a potential harbinger of democratic change in
the Arab world. But the US and Saudi envoys, while granting qualified praise
to the Yemeni achievement, have nonetheless sought to limit it in the
interests of regional stability.
Mr David Mack, the US deputy secretary of state for Middle Eastern affairs,
affirmed US support for Yemen's transition to democracy, but Mr Mack warned
Yemenis against thinking they could impose their political 'blueprint' on
neighbouring countries. 'It is important to remember that no country has a
blueprint for democracy in another country. . . So I don't think you should
look on what you do here as a model for anyone else to follow,' he told
Yemeni journalists.
Mr Mack denied that Saudi Arabia or any other country in the region has
expressed concern over the Yemeni elections and said that governments in the
area were not 'surprised' at US support for democracy in Yemen. That view
was apparently confirmed by a visit on Tuesday by Dr Abdulaziz al-Khuwaytir,
Saudi Arabia's education minister.
But diplomats in Sanaa suggest that Dr al-Khuwaytir's visit is an outward
show of support which masks deeper Saudi concerns. 'The Saudi regime is very
concerned about the Yemeni turn to democracy and, in particular, about the
successful outcome of the elections. 'The last thing Saudi royalty wants on
its doorstep is a successful little democracy in Yemen,' one western
diplomat said.
A Gulf diplomat suggests that the Saudis may also be concerned about a
potential Yemeni threat to their hegemony in the region. 'The Saudis are
taking a longer view of political development in the area and recognise that
in 10-15 years Yemen could be an important political rival in the Arabian
peninsula. Already other Gulf countries are looking upon Yemen with
interest. So it is better for the Saudis to appear friendly at this point
than to appear unfriendly and run into trouble down the road,' he said.
Yemen's leaders, aware of the Saudi unease, have already stated their
disinclination to impose their new political model elsewhere. 'Other people
may have something to learn from their example, but we are not looking to
teach them anything. We are not in the business of exporting democracy,'
Vice President Ali Salem al-Beidh told the Financial Times before the
elections.
Yemen's voting resulted in no clear-cut majority for any party, but between
them the current ruling coalition of the General People's Congress and the
Yemeni Socialist party won enough of the 301 seats in parliament to form a
government. In power since the unification of North and South Yemen nearly
three years ago, the GPC and YSP on Monday signed a political charter
renewing their alliance.

FT  14 MAY 93 / EC warns Croats to stop attacks: International reprisals
threat over assault on Bosnian Moslems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE European Community has warned Croatia and the Bosnian Croats that they
risk international reprisals if they do not stop attacking Moslems in
central and south-western Bosnia, the Danish Foreign Ministry announced
yesterday.
It said that Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, Denmark's foreign minister, in his
capacity as current EC council president, had sent a sharply worded letter
to President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia on Wednesday.
The letter said the Croatian government and its Bosnian Croat allies must
swiftly announce their clear intention to end the violence.
'If the Croatian attacks do not stop, the international community will
consider stronger measures against Croatia and the Bosnian Croats, similar
to the measures being imposed on the Serbs.'
Russia yesterday said the states trying to end the conflict in Bosnia had
made no firm proposals on what should be done if the Bosnian Serbs reject an
international peace plan in a referendum to be held this weekend.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister said in a newspaper interview
that no measures, 'including severe ones,' had been either agreed or ruled
out in advance.
His statement echoed remarks by President Bill Clinton suggesting that
Washington had become much less keen to go ahead with bombing raids or the
selective lifting of the arms embargo to help the Bosnian Moslems, because
of European opposition.
Mr Kozyrev said talks on 'political, possibly military, and possibly binding
measures' should resume after the Bosnian Serb referendum, in the UN
Security Council and within the framework of the EC-sponsored London
Conference on the former Yugoslavia.
He praised the Serbian government for its support of the peace plan drawn up
by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the international mediators, in the face of
its re-jection by the Bosnian Serbs.
The more the Serbian government continued on this path, the more decisively
Russia would support it, he said. This included actions in the UN Security
Council 'with a view to a stage-by-stage lifting of sanctions and the return
(of the rump Yugoslavia) to international organisations.'
In Belgrade, officials said a pan-Serbian parliament meeting to persuade the
Bosnian Serbs to accept the Vance-Owen plan would go ahead today in spite of
being boycotted by the Bosnian Serbs.
The meeting was called by President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and the
leaders of Montenegro and the rump Yugoslav federation because peace in
Bosnia was considered by them to be a matter for all the Serbs. In such a
joint session, it was virtually certain that the Bosnian Serbs would have
been heavily outvoted.
Rather than fall into this trap, the Bosnian Serbs have preferred to go
ahead with what can only be a travesty of democracy, given the war
conditions prevailing in Bosnia.
Meanwhile, some 100 Spanish UN peacekeeping troops re-entered the Bosnian
city of Mostar yesterday, after being forced to retreat under fire to its
outskirts four days ago. An officer, injured then, died of his wounds in
Madrid yesterday.
The Spaniards redeployed after a UN-mediated ceasefire was signed between
Croat and Moslem forces. Sporadic small arms fire could still be heard late
yesterday. More than 1,300 Moslem civilians detained by the Croats were due
to be released.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Andreotti in vote to end immunity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR GIULIO ANDREOTTI, seven times prime minister of Italy, yesterday voted
with the majority of the Senate to waive his parliamentary immunity to be
questioned by Palermo magistrates for allegedly consorting with the Sicilian
Mafia.
The Senate also adopted new parliamentary procedure, using for the first
time an open rather than a secret vote in a case of waiving immunity.
At the same time the Chamber of Deputies voted overwhelmingly to abolish
parliamentary immunity in cases of corruption and serious crimes.
Palermo magistrates are anxious to establish whether Mr Andreotti acted as a
point of reference for the Mafia in Rome, helping to provide them with
political cover. The allegations have been made by at least three key former
Mafia members  - the so-called pentiti - who are co-operating with Italian
justice under witness protection programmes.
On April 27, a Senate commission agreed that Mr Andreotti, a life senator,
should have his immunity waived. Two weeks ago he himself signalled his wish
that it be so to clear his name more rapidly.
This decision followed the uproar over the chamber of deputies voting to
protect Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, from facing four of
six corruption charges.
When Mr Andreotti was first notified he was under investigation last month,
he claimed Palermo magistrates were conspiring to discredit him and claimed
he could never get a fair hearing.
Before the vote yesterday he conducted a vigorous self-defence for the
fourth time since the issue was first brought before the Senate a month ago.
He dismissed as 'extravagant insinuations' the pentiti testimony.
But Mr Andreotti did not, as on previous occasions, attempt detailed
rebuttals of their evidence. He merely placed before the Senate his record
as a man of state. Rome magistrates said yesterday they had advised Mr Valdo
Spini, Socialist environment minister, that he was under investigation for
alleged abuse of public office over Italy's aid programme to Albania. He is
the first member of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's two-week-old government to
fall under suspicion in the country's bribery scandal.

<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government yesterday failed to agree a long-promised industrial
policy because of divisions over how generous the cash-strapped state can be
as it tries to tackle inflation.
At yesterday's cabinet meeting older conservatives disagreed among
themselves rather than clashing with young monetarist-minded radicals. The
cabinet ordered the redrafting of a plan which was supposed to provide
selective support for industry after Mr Oleg Lobov, first deputy prime
minister in charge of the economy, widened it to support virtually all
economic sectors.
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, said the plan had to focus on
priority sectors as the state had to avoid fuelling inflation by printing
money.
Mr Ivan Materov, the deputy economic minister, who presented the plan to the
cabinet, said its intention was to support areas which did not enjoy demand
now but would do so once the economy pulled out of its 'deep depression'.

<TEXT>
FRANCE signalled yesterday it would not allow any disagreement with the US
over the right tactics in Bosnia to check its slow move towards a closer
relationship with Nato.
'Without returning to Nato's integrated military command, we want to
demonstrate that there are more relaxed relations between France and the
Atlantic alliance,' the Foreign Ministry spokesman said. 'We are very
attached to the Atlantic alliance and particularly to the presence of
American troops in Europe.'
A day earlier Mr Francois Leotard, defence minister, had said France might
adopt Spain's compromise towards Nato later this year.
Like the French, Spanish troops do not come under peacetime Nato command;
but unlike France, Madrid sends its defence minister to Nato meetings.
Mr Leotard also said in a Le Monde interview that it would be 'useful for
more French officers to participate' in Nato meetings. Reuter also reported
that France had reclaimed limited voting rights in Nato's supreme military
committee. A French official said France had voted on peacekeeping
operations discussed by the committee but reverted to non-voting observer
status on other issues.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Danish Referendum: Pro-Maastricht tide buoys the Yes
campaign - Quiet optimism that the vote will be carried this time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORALE was high at the Copenhagen offices of the pro-Maastricht European
Movement, where young volunteers were busy stuffing envelopes and preparing
for a final effort to ensure a Yes vote in next Tuesday's second Danish
referendum on the treaty.
'We are better organised this time and we have better co-operation among the
political parties,' said Mr Lars Bech Pedersen, an organiser of the
movement's 150 volunteers campaigning in the capital. 'We are more on the
street this time, we have got closer to the public.'
Those urging a Yes vote have drawn encouragement from opinion polls less
than a week before polling day showing a significant lead for their camp  -
comparing favourably with last June when the outcome was a 50.7-49.3 victory
for the Noes.
The painful memory of that unexpected result has induced a nervous
reluctance among Yes campaigners to assume that they will win this time and
lift the cloud of uncertainty that has hung over the European Community
since the first vote. But two factors have given them hope.
First, they can argue that most of the Danes' objections to Maastricht have
been overcome by the agreement at last December's Edinburgh summit. This
allowed Denmark to opt out of the treaty's provisions on defence
co-operation, a common EC currency, Community-wide police co-operation and
union citizenship.
Second, a change of regime in January putting the country's largest party,
the Social Democratic party, at the head of the government has increased the
prospect of left-of-centre voters supporting the treaty. Last June, more
than 60 per cent of Social Democratic supporters voted No, in defiance of
their leadership. This time, opinion polls suggest a majority of them will
vote Yes.
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Liberal party leader and foreign minister for 10
years until the change of government, negotiated the Edinburgh opt-outs
despite his personal belief that Denmark should accept Maastricht without
them. 'I was the one who could persuade the other countries to give us the
opt-out deal because they knew that when I said it was necessary, it was
true. But, to be honest, it is the Social Democrats who can deliver a Yes on
Tuesday.'
The seven of parliament's eight parties who are campaigning for a Yes are
all doing so individually, often citing very different reasons.
Nevertheless, there is a common emphasis that Denmark should remain a core
member of the European club, where it can retain an influence on Europe's
future.
Ms Margrethe Auken, a priest and member of the left-wing Socialist People's
party, who was trying to persuade her often doubting colleagues at the
party's annual congress last weekend, put it this way: 'If Maastricht falls
because we vote No, at worst European co-operation will break up altogether,
and at best, even if it doesn't, Denmark will be without any influence on
Europe.'
The young campaigners for the European Movement say that an objection they
often meet on the street is that the political superstructure of Maastricht
will submerge small countries like Denmark.
Said Mr Bech Pedersen: 'We say that if there is a No vote you would get a
super union of Germany and France and perhaps the Benelux countries, which
would not be good for Denmark. That would be precisely the strong Germany
that Danes are afraid of.'
Last year the Yes campaign made some wild warnings about the economic
consequences of a No, which proved counter-productive, he said.
This year, the pro-Maastricht campaigners have played down the scare
tactics, but, all the same, the economy is clearly an important issue. One
opinion poll indicated that the decisive factor for most Yes voters is that
it will lead to a better climate for the economy at a time when unemployment
is running at 12 per cent.
'What it comes down to for most people is economic prosperity versus fears
of a loss of independence for Denmark,' said Mr Pedersen's co-campaigner, Mr
Niels Kristensen.
Recognising the potency of the fears about independence, the prime minister,
Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, has turned the argument on its head.
'As members of the European Union we shall be adding a dimension to our
independence. We must not duck this challenge,' he tells his audiences. 'So
if you are worried about independence, vote Yes]'
Supporters of the treaty have some confidence that the vote will go their
way, but they are not taking anything for granted. 'My credibility as a
forecaster was severely damaged last year,' said Mr Ellemann-Jensen. 'I
think it will be a Yes this time. But somebody could still goof, and we
know, too, that many voters only make up their minds at the last minute.'

Meanwhile, some 100 Spanish UN peacekeeping troops re-entered the Bosnian
city of Mostar yesterday, after being forced to retreat under fire to its
outskirts four days ago.
They redeployed after a UN-mediated ceasefire was signed between Croat and
Moslem forces. More than 1,300 Moslem civilians detained by the Croats were
due to be released.
A French UN helicopter was hit by gunfire and forced to make an emergency
landing after evacuating wounded people from Zepa in eastern Bosnia, which
has been besieged by Bosnian Serb troops. A UN spokesman said no-one had
been injured.

THE RUSSIAN government yesterday failed to agree a long-promised industrial
policy because of divisions over how generous the cash-strapped state can be
as it tries to tackle inflation.
Yesterday's cabinet meeting was remarkable for splitting along unexpected
fault lines, with older conservatives disagreeing among each other rather
than clashing with young monetarist-minded radicals.
The cabinet ordered the redrafting of a plan which was supposed to provide
selective support for industry after Mr Oleg Lobov - recently appointed
first deputy prime minister in charge of the economy by President Boris
Yeltsin - widened it to support virtually all economic sectors.
Supported by radicals like Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister,
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, said the plan had to focus on
priority sectors because the state had to avoid fuelling inflation by
printing money.
Mr Ivan Materov, the deputy economic minister, who presented the plan to the
cabinet, told a news conference its intention was to support areas which did
not enjoy demand now but would do so once the economy pulled out of its
'deep depression'.
Although the government's priorities have already been defined as energy,
food processing, conversion of defence plans to civilian output, transport
and telecommunications, Mr Materov said 'virtually all sectors, for instance
television set production,' were worthy of support.
President Yeltsin, has signed a decree providing specific measures to speed
implementation of the government's mass privatisation, his office said
yesterday.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Escudo dragged into slipstream by 'integration'
</HEADLINE>

THE Portuguese escudo has once again been sucked into the peseta's
slipstream because of its links with the Spanish economy and Spanish
markets.
When the escudo devalued 6 per cent along with the peseta last November, the
finance ministry made clear it was reluctantly following suit because Spain
had taken over from Germany as Portugal's main trading partner. There was no
other strong reason for Portugal to devalue then, officials said at the
time. Yesterday there was no sign that the move would be received any
differently.
Economic analysts believe that the government was forced into yesterday's
decision by the realisation that, faced with a devaluation of the peseta, it
would find it too costly to keep the escudo within its fluctuation band
without a realignment.
'With a peseta devaluation, the speculation around the escudo would be so
strong that the Portuguese government would not be able to resist following
suit,' said Mr Rui Martins dos Santos, chief economist with Banco Portugues
de Investimentos. 'The market likes simple messages and it has taken on
board the idea that the Spanish and Portuguese economies are so potentially
integrated that the escudo has to follow any peseta devaluation.'
Mr Nuno da Rocha Correia, an analyst with brokers Independente, said: 'The
Portuguese government won't welcome this devaluation as it runs contrary to
its macro-economic policy of maintaining a strong escudo to hold down
inflation and improve the competitiveness of exports through productivity
gains rather than depreciation of the currency.'
But he added, 'The government may be relieved that some of the pressure of
defending the escudo has been taken off. It will also be welcomed by what
has become known as the 'real economy', exporters and small-and medium-sized
businesses.'
After the announcement in Brussels, Mr Antonio Gutteres, leader of the
opposition Socialist party, said: 'This represents a defeat for the policies
of the government who have always defended a strong escudo.'

SWEDEN'S central bank, the Riksbank, yesterday cut Sweden's key marginal
lending rate by 0.25 per cent to 9.0 per cent, the third reduction in
interest rates in a month.
The latest cut means that the marginal rate is now 3.5 percentage points
below its level last November when the krona was floated,
The Riksbank said the cut was justified by the general downward trend of
interest rates in other west European countries.
The central bank added that there was also reduced uncertainty over the
outcome of Sweden's annual round of wage negotiations, following a
settlement agreed between employers and engineering unions on Monday.
It noted that previous cuts had been well received by the financial markets.

involving the Commission and after consultation with the monetary committee,
decided to fix new central rates in the EMS.
The bilateral central rates of the Spanish peseta and of the Portuguese

reduced by 8 per cent and 6.5 per cent respectively.
'The new Ecu central rates are the following (in units of national

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
'Ministers and central bank governors consider it essential for Spain to
achieve the full implementation of the convergence programme policies.
'They also took note of the Portuguese government's commitment to their
basic policy stance of budget discipline, which in the view of the
Portuguese authorities, together with continued wage moderation and
structural reforms, will contribute to non-inflationary growth, employment
creation and a decline in interest rates. The agri-monetary consequences of
the present realignment will be examined by the competent bodies.
'The new bilateral central rates and the compulsory intervention points in
the exchange rate mechanism will be communicated by the central banks in
time for the opening of foreign exchange markets on May 14 1993.'
The monetary committee's communique was issued at the end of an eight-hour
meeting in Brussels. The secretive committee had long been scheduled to meet
yesterday to put the finishing touches to a report saying the exchange rate
mechanism is in good shape. The report, commissioned at the height of last
autumn's currency crisis, is due to be handed to EC finance ministers when
they meet on May 21.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Gonzalez eases pre-election pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE pressure on Spain's currency became too much yesterday. Devaluation may
have been the only option, but it might prove to be the smartest move yet
for the embattled socialist government since the prime minister, Mr Felipe
Gonzalez, three weeks ago, called a snap general election for June 6.
Political opponents will see the move as a defeat and a humiliation. The
government has been insisting it would not devalue and that the peseta was
correctly valued within the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System.
Analysts in Madrid agreed yesterday that the Bank of Spain had little option
but to ask the European Community's monetary committee for the realignment.
The Bank of Spain has been buying pesetas forward to see off speculators,
and its reserves  - which are believed to have fallen from more than Dollars
60bn (Pounds 39bn) last autumn to less than Dollars 20bn now if its futures
contracts are taken into account  - are badly depleted. The central bank and
the finance ministry decided to seek a realignment the moment pressure began
to build up yesterday. 'There was just too much ammunition out there,' said
one senior Madrid banker. 'It was inevitable,' said Mr Ignacio Gomez
Montejo, chief economist at brokers FG.
He believed the move would damage the government's election prospects,
especially since Spain has devalued three times since last September. It
would help bring down interest rates quite rapidly this year but, he added:
'It's too late to help the government in the election. Three devaluations in
nine months is a (political) disaster.'
'It was unavoidable but it's not a disaster,' said Mr Miguel del Valle,
chief of research at Banco Central Hispano, who said he thought the peseta
would not depreciate too far at its new parity and that it might even
appreciate.
That view is supported by Mr Carlos Sebastian, chief economist at brokers
Iberagentes.
He said the peseta was, at worst, 5 per cent overvalued at around Pta73.50
to the D-Mark, but that the markets had worried that should the conservative
opposition People's party win the election, it might take the currency out
of the system altogether.
Being forced out of the ERM would be a political calamity from which the
prime minister could not recover. As it is, the obstacles confronting him
between now and June are daunting. Ironically, devaluation could help him to
deal with them. An official unemployment survey today was uppermost in the
minds of the authorities when they decided to devalue yesterday.
Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister, mischievously leaked the survey
results last night after the devaluation of 8 per cent was announced.
The survey reports 253,000 new unemployed in the first quarter of 1993,
pushing total unemployment to a record 21.7 per cent.
This is bad election news. But the most serious worry now for the Bank of
Spain, is that employers may no longer feel pressured to deal firmly with
high wage demands. The few agreements that have been signed in the spring
wage round so far have been close to 7 per cent.
While the inflationary effects of the devaluation are unlikely to be severe,
given the recession and the slump in consumer demand, April inflation
figures published yesterday were disappointing for the government.
They showed a 0.4 per cent increase in consumer prices in April, bringing
year on year inflation up from 4 per cent in March to 4.6 per cent last
month. But devaluation will also allow voters to get used to the idea before
election day that interest rates really are falling. Following last night's
announcement that the Bank of Spain would cut its official intervention rate
from 13 per cent to 11.5 per cent, commercial banks are likely to follow
suit.
Mr Montejo said the official central bank intervention rate was likely to
fall to 11 per cent by August.
The government will be able to argue, too, that it has dealt with crippling
interest rates and an overvalued currency. In fact, the new parity of
Pta79.11 to the D-Mark gives the Spanish currency a comfortable cushion.
While it floated briefly yesterday, it was trading at around Pta76 to the
German currency.
Pressure on the peseta has been caused by Spain's rapidly growing current
account deficit  - 3.3 per cent of GDP last year, it was in surplus until
1988 when a consumer boom began to suck in imports.
Already, Spain's exports have begun to pick up in the wake of the last two
devaluations.
It remains to be seen how well the socialists manage the fall-out from the
devaluation. Until yesterday, it seemed Mr Gonzalez had overcome the
political divisions in his party and that, despite a surge in support for
the opposition, the socialists would win the most seats in what is likely to
be a hung parliament. That would enable him to form the next government.
What is important now for the government is time. Spain's socialists are not
about to be blown away like their French counterparts. This will be the
worst weekend of the campaign for the prime minister, but there are still 24
days to the election. He still has everything to play for.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Exchange rate machismo ends: Spanish devaluation underlines
monetary split in the EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, DAVID MARSH and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXCHANGE RATE machismo finally went out of fashion yesterday when the
Spanish and Portuguese governments requested a devaluation of their
currencies within the European exchange rate mechanism.
The events underline the monetary split in the European Community between
the 'inner core' nations centred on Germany and other countries which are
constrained by economic weakness in pegging their currencies to the D-Mark.
Yesterday's discussions in the EC's monetary committee illustrate the new
sense of realism established in Europe over exchange rates in the aftermath
of last year's ERM crisis.
Out has gone the idea that countries should cling on to their ERM parities
regardless of the cost in terms of foreign-currency reserves, high interest
rates and high exchange rates reducing export competitiveness. Instead has
come a sense of submission to the forces of the Dollars 1,000bn-a-day
currency market.
The new mood has been struck most forcibly by the Bundesbank, which has been
conveying ever more rigorously its view that countries with currencies under
persistent strain should seek timely devaluations.
Admittedly, in the case of Spain, the pressures of a general election
campaign played their part in forcing the peseta into its third devaluation
since the onset of ERM turbulence last September. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the
Spanish prime minister, and Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister, have
become aware in recent weeks that their government's hold on power was being
increasingly put at risk by the economic rigour needed to defend the
peseta's D-Mark parity.
Even so, Mr Solchaga went out of his way less than two weeks ago to rule out
a further peseta re-adjustment. 'We are not going to devalue, not this
weekend, nor the next weekend nor at any time on the horizon,' he told
reporters in Washington where he was attending meetings of the International
Monetary Fund.
Yesterday's decision by Mr Gonzalez and Mr Solchaga to renege on this
commitment was sparked by the heavy selling of the peseta on exchange
markets on Wednesday, which forced the Bank of Spain to dig even deeper into
its already depleted reserves. The ministers' action virtually forced
Portugal also to request a devaluation  - the second affecting the escudo
since last autumn  - by dint of the two countries' close trading links.
Mr Luis Angel Rojo, the Bank of Spain governor, who met other EC central
bank governors at Basle for their regular monthly meeting at the beginning
of this week, did not discuss the move with them, Spanish officials said
yesterday.
However, the problems facing Spain were the subject of a special, secret
discussion by the EC governors at their Basle meeting in March. 'We all knew
the Spaniards were in for a rough ride (in keeping the peseta within its ERM
limit) and some of us were surprised they held out for so long,' a central
banker said yesterday. Another banker suggested that the decision to seek a
devaluation in trading hours smacked of panic.
However, another point of view was that Spain announced its move yesterday
morning to prevent more damaging speculation against the peseta as the
monetary committee meeting  - a regular event scheduled weeks ago  - took
place.
Yesterday's development was likely to reinforce already existing pressures
for a two or multi-speed drive towards monetary integration in Europe. Spain
and Portugal are now clearly in the slow lane, along with Britain and Italy,
which both left the ERM last year.
The devaluation of the Spanish and Portuguese currencies comes in spite of
increasingly aggressive moves by the Bundesbank to cut interest rates in
recent weeks  - events which in theory should have reduced the pressures on
some of the weaker ERM currencies.
Even so, in several statements during the past few weeks, the Bundesbank has
made clear its extreme reluctance to take part in open-ended intervention
operations to bail out currencies judged by the market to be fundamentally
over-valued.

THE European Commission said yesterday it had no immediate intention to bow
to Norwegian pressure and withdraw proposals aimed at increasing competition
in North Sea oil and gas exploration.
A spokeswoman for Mr Abel Matutes, the EC energy commissioner, said the
decision on whether to adopt the directive was up to the 12 existing members
of the Community. 'We can't take a decision on the basis of the hypothetical
situation that Norway has joined,' she said.
Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister, warned this week
that adoption of the measure could hinder attempts to convince the country's
electorate about the benefits of EC membership.
The directive would outlaw preferential treatment of national oil and gas
companies applying for drilling or exploration licences and has provoked
strong opposition from Denmark, which holds the presidency of the EC, and
from Norway, both of which grant certain licence privileges to their state
oil companies.
Last month, Denmark postponed an energy ministers' meeting partly to avoid a
sensitive decision on the directive.
Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen adds: Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany has
written to the Danish government, signalling support for Denmark and Norway
over the proposed EC directive on oil and gas licensing, according to the
Danish prime minister, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of France yesterday announced a reduction of 0.25 percentage points
in its leading interest rates, the sixth fall in official rates since
France's centre-right government took power six weeks ago.
The intervention rate was reduced to 7.75 per cent and the short-term
5-to-10 day facility to 8.75 per cent. The bank's announcement, which
followed the news from Spain, took the markets by surprise. It came only a
day after the main commercial banks had reduced base rates to 9 per cent and
less than a week after the last cut in official rates.
Economists had anticipated further falls in French rates but had expected
the French authorities to wait until after next Tuesday's Danish referendum
on the Maastricht treaty. However, the French franc remained robust after
the announcement. It ended the day at FFr3.3715 against the D-Mark, compared
with FFr3.3720 on Wednesday.
The stock market's response was also positive. The CAC-40 Index, which has
been sluggish in recent days, edged higher to close up 0.39 at 1,879.93.
Both Mr Edouard Balladur, the new French prime minister, and Mr Edmond
Alphandery, his economy minister, have made it clear that they hope for
further falls in interest rates to alleviate the pressure on the French
economy.
Hopes of recovery were encouraged by yesterday's publication of provisional
figures by the state statistics institute, Insee,indicating that inflation
rose by less than 0.2 per cent in April, bringing the annual rate to just
over 2.1 per cent.
However, Insee also endorsed earlier warnings that the French economy is now
in recession by forecasting a 1 per cent decline in the real rate of GDP
growth for 1993.

FT  14 MAY 93 / IG Metall gives warning: First sign of compromise emerges in
pay dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IG METALL, Germany's powerful union, will expand its strike to the whole of
eastern Germany next week unless talks that resumed in the Saxon capital of
Dresden yesterday lead to a break in the deadlock with employers.
But last night there was the first sign of a tentative compromise, when the
union said it had reached agreement about exempting less well-off
enterprises from the sharp pay rises being sought. This accord came after
seven hours of talks.
The union said formal talks with employers aimed at ending the 11-day-old
strike in some eastern German enteprises would begin later.
Earlier, Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the president of IG Metall, said that more
engineering and steel plants would be targeted throughout eastern Germany's
five states, in a move which could paralyse what remains of the region's
industrial sector.
'In my opinion, the strikes will last for quite some time,' he said.
'Despite all the ostensible protests from the employers' federations of
their readiness to compromise, IG Metall is nevertheless prepared that the
conflict over eastern wage contracts will not be settled this week,' he
added.
Gesamtmetall, the metal and electrical engineering employers' association,
said the union's attitude would lead to a long labour dispute in eastern
Germany.
More than 40,000 eastern German workers from among 90 enterprises are now
taking part in the action. Beginning next Monday, a further 15 plants in
eastern Berlin, and nine enterprises from the engineering sectors in
Thuringia will start indefinite strikes for the first time.
IG Metall is determined to keep up the pressure on the employers so that
they will reinstate a contract, signed in March 1991 with the union. This
contract would have equalised western and eastern German wages levels by
next year.
That would have entailed pay rises of more than 20 per cent for the steel,
engineering and electrical sectors in eastern Germany, where wage levels are
at present about 65 per cent of the western German levels.
IG Metall insists it is prepared to compromise on a number of issues. These
include putting back the timetable towards income parity, as well as
compromising on extra Christmas pay, holidays, working hours, and other
benefits. But a union official yesterday said that IG Metall would not
compromise on the basic wage, the principle of the original contract.
'That is what is at stake,' said Mr Michael Bohm, IG Metall's spokesman for
Berlin-Brandenburg.
For their part, the employers, especially its members from the Mittelstand
 -the small and medium-sized enterprises  - are determined not to reinstate
the contract.
This strong lobby in Gesamtmetall has more to lose in eastern Germany than
the large western German companies which can afford to pay the increases.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Path of peseta pleases exporters

THE PROSPECT of a peseta devaluation has had Spain's business leaders,
especially exporters, on the edge of their seats for weeks.
'I'm counting on it,' said Mr Pedro Ballve, chairman of the biggest
processed meats group, Campofrio, a few days ago. 'It's desperately
necessary. We need an exchange rate that reflects the true wealth of our
country.'
In the Basque country, industrialists, most of whom export, had been
lobbying for a devaluation for weeks. 'A devaluation would have a minimal
effect on inflation,' said Mr Enrique Portacarrero, head of a regional
employers' confederation. 'The effect on import prices will be minimal
because the recession has cut demand so much.'
In all, the peseta has fallen about 20 per cent against the D-Mark since
last autumn. The apparent inability to find a parity within the European
Monetary System is an embarrassment to the government but it has been a boon
to business as the country has slipped into recession.
Recent official figures show that Spanish exports, which grew more slowly
than imports for most of the 1980s, have suddenly taken off since last
autumn. In the first quarter of this year exports rose 12.7 per cent, while
imports fell 6 per cent. In the six months to the end of March, exports grew
5.5 per cent while imports fell 6.5 per cent.
'The only good economic news we have had in the last year has been export
growth,' says Mr Ballve.
But while yesterday's devaluation may further quicken export growth, some
economists worry that unless wage rises slow, the competitive effect may be
lost. 'It was probably not a good idea to devalue before this year's wage
round has been completed,' said one Madrid banker. 'The settlements are
coming in at above 6 per cent, which is too high.'
The decision to devalue the peseta is a result of the country's inability to
develop a competitive exporting industry and its traditional reliance on
tourism to cover its large trade deficit. That pattern was broken by the
economic boom after the country joined the European Community in 1986. It
triggered a massive influx of imports, which last year resulted in a current
account deficit worth 3.3 per cent of gross domestic product.
Savings in Spain are low and Madrid has to attract foreign funds to cover
that deficit and analysts said yesterday the devaluation would help reassure
foreign markets that the peseta would now stabilise.

MR Bernard Bosson, the French transport minister, yesterday warned that Air
France and the SNCF rail group, two of France's largest public sector
companies, should reduce their reliance on government support.
His warning reflects the new tough stance of France's new centre-right
government towards the public sector signalled earlier this week by Mr
Gerard Longuet, industry minister. He announced that state companies could
no longer depend on the government to bale them out financially and to
protect them from international investors.
Mr Bosson continued this theme by warning that Air France was in such
difficulty that 'the very existence of the company is at stake'. He said the
airline should accelerate its restructuring programme and would have to
'rely on itself'.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Solidarity on collision course with coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND'S Solidarity trade union has threatened to call a general strike next
week in its bid to win higher wages for teachers, health service workers and
other public sector employees.
The call would be accompanied by a no confidence motion in Ms Hanna
Suchocka's coalition government by the Solidarity's group of deputies in
parliament, according to Mr Marian Krzaklewski, the Solidarity leader.
The government is based on a six-party coalition which controls 177 votes in
the 460 seat Sejm, the more important chamber in parliament. The Solidarity
leadership has given the government until May 18 to come up with
'satisfactory' answers to the movement's demands which the government says
cannot be fulfilled, given present budget restrictions.
This year's budget deficit has been set in the agreement with the
International Monetary Fund at 82,000bn zloty (Pounds 3.1bn) or 5 per cent
of gross domestic product and any unward revision could lead to suspension
of successive tranches of Dollars 660m worth of standby credits due to run
until the spring of 1994.
As it is, the government will in any case be hard pressed to meet the IMF
target, thanks to a recent parliamentary vote increasing pensions and
forgiving housing loans extended before 1990, which threaten to put a
further 20,000bn zloty onto the deficit.
The root of Solidarity's rift with the government lies in the fact that its
role has been largely restricted to that of a trade union since the end of
communist rule. Before that, it was an all-embracing opposition movement.
'The cause of the dramatic public sector strikes. . . is the arrogance of
the government and attacks on the union by representatives of the state
administration,' Solidarity's National Commission said in a toughly worded
statement.
Some union leaders have increasingly sided with workers disillusioned with
reforms which have increased inflation and unemployment but brought them few
concrete rewards. Some union deputies have voted against the government in
parliament.
Meanwhile, workers in the south western Walbrzych region who have been
striking and blockading the local government headquarters to demand
effective restructuring policies suspended their protest after a promise of
talks with the government due to begin today.
Solidarity has fewer than 2m members but showed last December it is capable
of mounting large-scale strikes when it led a three-week stoppage in coal
mines.
Solidarity unionists are planning a half-hour token stoppage in the
industrial region of Silesia today and railway workers are considering
strikes early next week.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Peseta devalued by 8% in ERM: Lisbon realigns escudo as
Madrid plans 1 1/2 point rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN will cut interest rates by 1 1/2 percentage points today after
devaluing the peseta 8 per cent in the fifth European currency realignment
since last September's monetary crisis.
The Spanish move, accompanied by a 6.5 per cent devaluation of the
Portuguese escudo, took European currency markets by surprise, just three
weeks before Spain's general election on June 6.
In London, Mr John Major, the prime minister, chose a day of new instability
in the European exchange rate mechanism to express the government's strong
reluctance to bringing the pound back into the ERM. Asked in the House of
Commons to make it clear that Britain would not return to 'fixed exchange
rates' by Mr Toby Jessel, a Tory Eurosceptic, Mr Major said the government
would not 'even begin to consider' whether to rejoin the ERM until the
requirements of German and UK monetary policy were 'much more closely in
line'.
The upheaval within the European monetary system comes just five days before
the crucial second Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty.
Following the peseta and escudo devaluations, the Danish krone weakened
slightly inside the ERM amid fears that the Danes may again vote No to the
treaty.
But other currencies remained unchanged, including the French franc, in
spite of the Bank of France's decision to cut its two main interest rates by
 1/4 percentage point.
The main cause of yesterday's Spanish devaluation was heavy peseta selling
pressure which has caused a sharp fall in the Bank of Spain's reserves.
The Madrid government yesterday morning requested its European Community
partners to agree a devaluation, which was subsequently worked out at a
meeting of the EC's monetary committee in Brussels.
Portugal reluctantly agreed to accompany the devaluation, in a bid to remain
competitive with Spain, its biggest trading partner.
The devaluation, together with the cut in the Bank of Spain's main money
market intervention rate to 11 1/2 per cent from 13 per cent, will bring
some relief to the hard-pressed economy. But the sudden collapse of the
Spanish socialist government's resolve to resist speculative pressure was
fiercely criticised by Spanish employers.
The CEOE, the Spanish employers' organisation which strongly supports the
opposition conservative party, said the devaluation  - the peseta's third
downward move since September  - showed 'the failure of economic policy'.
The CEOE said the government 'had to seek a new devaluation, after having
used up most of our foreign exchange reserves to maintain the exchange rate
and after having held interest rates at unsustainable levels.' Spanish
economists believe Spain may have spent up to Dollars 35bn (Pounds 22.7bn)
since last November to support the peseta. Although the Bank of Spain
officially says that its reserves are around Dollars 45bn, the bank has been
intervening in support of the peseta by buying the currency forward.
Analysts believe that this may have reduced reserves overall to less than
Dollars 20bn.
The foreign exchange markets have been buffeted by rumours of unusual Bank
of Spain transactions in currency options, as part of measures to shore up
the peseta.
The Bank of Spain last night denied any such activities, denouncing rumours
of this as acts of disinformation. Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish finance
minister, said it had been impossible to fight against a market focusing not
on economic fundamentals but on election uncertainty.
The move is likely to reinforce concern in Brussels about the effect of
competitive devaluations on the prospects for European economic and monetary
union, already damaged by doubts about the future of the Maastricht treaty.
However, in a curt statement, officials described the devaluations as a
routine matter reached through mutual agreement, implicitly confirming the
recent conclusion of EC central bankers that the ERM does not need
fundamental reform.
The ERM tensions were discussed in three separate telephone conferences
yesterday among the 12 European Community governors.
One central banker said: 'Everyone was adamant that the peseta and the
escudo stay inside the system.'

FT  14 MAY 93 / BT profits fall Pounds 1bn on cost of job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunication's heavy redundancy costs caused a Pounds 1.1bn
fall in its pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.98bn for the year ended March and
contributed to a worse-than-expected deficit in its pension fund.
Changes in advanced corporation tax in the March Budget and dividend income
lower than forecast were additional factors in the Pounds 750m pension fund
deficit, foreshadowing similar pressure on other companies' pension funds.
BT topped up its fund and resumed corporate contributions at the beginning
of this financial year but the impact on profits is likely to be moderate,
analysts said.
The salary of Mr Iain Vallance, BT's chairman, is to be frozen at Pounds
465,000 and will not be reviewed again until July 1994. The
performance-related component remains unchanged at Pounds 90,000.
Despite the recession, turnover was only slightly lower at Pounds 13.24bn.
Underlying turnover growth of 2.8 per cent in the final quarter led BT to
claim it had 'turned the corner quite significantly'.
An 8.3 per cent increase in net dividend payments and the strong cashflow of
the business pleased the City.
Analysts were untroubled by the unexpected size of the pension fund deficit.
BT's shares closed 1.5p up, at 404p, encouraging news for the government as
it prepares to sell a third tranche of its BT shares in July.
The pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.98bn were after Pounds 1.03bn in charges for
the voluntary redundancy scheme which reduced BT's workforce by 19 per cent
over the year to 171,000. Disposals and the repurchase of bonds reduced
profits by a further Pounds 190m.
BT proposed a final dividend of 9.45p to make a total of 15.6p a share, up
8.3 per cent up on the previous year. Earnings per share fell to 19.8p from
33.2p.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Receivers called in at Swan Hunter: More than 6,000 jobs at
risk in north-east after yard loses order and takeover talks collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE and DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECEIVERS were called in yesterday to Swan Hunter, the Tyneside warship
builder, after its loss of a vital order for a Royal Navy helicopter
carrier.
The company is the last shipbuilder in north-east England, once the world's
biggest shipbuilding centre.
Price Waterhouse, appointed as receivers for the group's UK companies, said
'lay-offs' in Swan Hunter's 2,200-strong workforce 'may be unavoidable'.
About 4,000 more jobs in the north-east are estimated to depend indirectly
on Swan Hunter's survival. Many are in areas such as South Tyneside, where
male unemployment, according to official figures, is 28 per cent.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's shadow trade and industry secretary, described it as
'a grave blow to Tyneside'.
Directors of Swan Hunter, privatised in a management buy-out in 1986, said
the loss of the order to a consortium of VSEL and the Kvaerner Govan
merchant ship yard was only one of several factors behind the decision.
They asked Lloyds Bank to call in receivers after negotiations with 'a
substantial third party' for acquisition of the company were terminated. It
is understood that takeover talks by GEC were broken off when Swan failed to
win the carrier order.
The directors also blamed the non-payment by the Ministry of Defence of more
than Pounds 20m additional costs the company says it incurred in building an
auxiliary oil and supply ship, Fort George.
The MoD had failed to pay the claim in spite of assurances before Christmas
that it would be handled expeditiously, they said. 'This has created a
significant cash deficit and inability to pay our creditors.'
Against that background, the Swan Hunter Group was unable to secure any
further working capital facilities.
The directors called for an independent investigation into the contract
decision, saying they did not accept the 'credibility' of the MoD's claim
that there was a Pounds 50m difference in the bids.
The four directors, Mr Ken Chapman, Mr Alex Marsh and brothers Mr Peter and
Mr Roger Vaughan, refused to be interviewed about the end of their fight to
keep the business afloat.
The company is understood to have been unable to pay creditors for two
months. Its annual turnover is about Pounds 145m. In 1991, the last year it
filed accounts, it made a loss of Pounds 17.25m.

FT  14 MAY 93 / Women's pensions bill main casualty of legislative line-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICALLY sensitive plans to raise the state retirement age for women were
postponed by Cabinet ministers yesterday as they agreed a programme for next
year aimed at calming Tories with populist measures on crime and
deregulation.
The pensions equalisation bill was the biggest casualty as agreement was
reached on the legislative programme for the parliamentary session starting
in November.
A white paper, expected to recommend raising the state pension age for women
from 60 to 65 sometime next century, is now not likely until autumn.
Also delayed until the 1994-95 session at least is legislation on
privatising the Post Office.
But Cabinet ministers gave the go ahead to three Home Office bills  - on
Sunday trading, tougher penalties against juvenile and other criminals, and
restructuring the police service.
Mr John Major will today try to restore an impression of stable government
after the serious buffeting of the last week following disastrous
by-election and local election results. In spite of government U-turns this
week on schools testing and yesterday on the unit fines system, the prime
minister will seek to assure party activists at the Scottish Tory party
conference that he is determined to carry through the policies to which
Tories are pledged.
Mr Major will claim that a commitment to combat crime is an enduring
strength of the Conservative party and will promise all policies will be
geared towards a sustainable economic recovery.
The prime minister's office rebuffed suggestions the government had slimmed
down its legislative plans in the face of growing dissent within Tory ranks.
Adding to government difficulties was the death yesterday of Mr Robert
Adley, Tory MP for Christchurch, cutting the party's majority to 18.
The swing Liberal Democrats need to overturn his 23,000 majority is less
than the party achieved in last week's Newbury by-election.
Between 15 to 20 bills are expected for the parliamentary session beginning
in November. A bill on banking supervision promised after the collapse of
the Bank of Credit and Commerce International has been suspended.
But measures agreed for next year include a deregulation bill, drawn up by
the Department of Trade and Industry, but including the deregulation of
London buses.
The Foreign Office has won space for a bill to put the overseas security
service MI6 on a statutory basis. But the government has yet to decide on
whether to increase the accountability of MI6 and its domestic counterpart
MI5 to parliament.
A bill is expected on restricting media use of bugging and telephoto lenses
 - although ministers will deny it has been approved in response to claims
that the Royal family has been bugged.
Certain to be included, however, is legislation restricting the availability
of invalidity benefit, restructuring of Scottish and Welsh local councils,
privatising British Coal, setting up an environment protection agency,
reforming teacher training and ending the monopoly of the National Union of
Students.

FT  14 MAY 93 / BT profits fall Pounds 1bn as pension fund shows big deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH TELECOM yesterday reported a Pounds 1bn fall in full-year profits
and a far worse than expected deficit on its pension fund.
The setback on the pension fund is expected to make a significant dent in
its profits for next year and may foreshadow similar pressures on pension
funds generally.
The salary of Mr Iain Vallance, BT's chairman, is to be frozen at Pounds
465,000 and will not be reviewed again until July 1994. The
performance-related component remains unchanged at Pounds 90,000.
Despite the recession turnover for the year to March 31 was only slightly
down on 1991/92, and underlying income growth of 2.8 per cent in the final
quarter led BT to claim it had 'turned the corner quite significantly'.
With an 8 per cent increase in net dividend payments the City appeared to
discount the impact of the pension fund deficit in yesterday's trading. BT's
shares closed 1.5p up, at 404p, encouraging news for the government as it
prepares to sell a third tranche of its BT shares in July.
The pre-tax profits, down 36 per cent to Pounds 1.98bn from Pounds 3.1bn
last year, include over Pounds 1bn in costs incurred in the voluntary
redundancy scheme which helped reduce BT's workforce by 19 per cent over the
year. Disposals and the repurchase of bonds reduced profits by a further
Pounds 190m.
At 15.6p a share, the net dividend for the year was 8.3 per cent up on last
year, increasing payments to shareholders from Pounds 888m to Pounds 967m
despite a fall in earnings per share from 33.2p to 19.8p. BT said this was
justified by the 'underlying performance and financial strength'.
Because of a deficit of about Pounds 750m in its pension fund as of January
1, BT resumed the payment of employer contributions to the fund on April 1,
and plans to make an additional contribution of Pounds 800m. Its total net
contribution to the fund in the current year will be about Pounds 1.3bn,
compared to only Pounds 40m in the year just reported.
Mr Barry Romeril, BT's finance director, said the pension fund deficit was
not due to the past year's redundancies alone, but also to the poor
performance of dividends and property and to the impact of the changes to
Advance Corporation Tax announced in Mr Norman Lamont's spring budget.
The last two factors are thought to be having an adverse effect on most
pension funds, and others could soon be in a similar predicament.
Mr Vallance said: 'In a year when BT's prices were capped at 6 1/4 per cent
below the retail price index, we think customers and shareholders alike have
had a good deal.' The company shed nearly 40,000 jobs during the year, and
plans to cut 30,000 over the next two years. The cost of job losses in the
coming year is budgeted at around Pounds 500m.
The Telecommunications Users Association said there was 'no doubt' that BT's
quality of service was improving, though it was concerned at the impact of
job cuts on quality.
