FT  28 JUN 93 / Solchaga's nomination splits Socialists

MR FELIPE GONZALEZ has precipitated a split in the ruling Spanish Socialist
party (PSOE) by forcing through the nomination of Mr Carlos Solchaga as
party parliamentary spokesman.
Mr Gonzalez risked his survival as PSOE leader by confronting the party's
powerful deputy leader, Mr Alfonso Guerra, during a heated weekend meeting
of the Socialist leadership to decide the pivotal post.
Jettisoning the traditional show of consensus over top party appointments,
the Socialist executive voted 15-13 to support Mr Gonzalez's nomination of
Mr Solchaga, the economy minister in the outgoing government.
The nomination must now be endorsed by the party's MPs today.
By selecting Mr Solchaga, whose economic policies since 1985 have made him
deeply unpopular with the unions and with the left wing of the PSOE, Mr
Gonzalez has given the clearest indication to date of what sort of
government he intends to form.
He has also signalled that he intends to take on the PSOE party machinery,
which Mr Guerra turned into his personal power base after resigning as
deputy prime minister in the wake of a corruption scandal in 1991.
The nomination of Mr Solchaga, overriding the Guerra camp in the PSOE, sets
the stage for Mr Gonzalez to bring new faces, loyal to him and independent
of the party, into his forthcoming government. But it also raises the
prospect of a serious division in the Socialist ranks when the PSOE holds
its next party congress.
Mr Gonzalez will, in all likelihood, be forming a minority government
because the Catalan nationalists have declined his offer to join him as
junior coalition partners. The survival of his government will depend on his
ability to negotiate legislation with the opposition parties.
Supporters of Mr Gonzalez said at the weekend that the party congress, which
meets every three years and must be held before November 1994, could be
brought forward to this November in order to secure Mr Gonzalez's ascendancy
over the PSOE.
The immediate political agenda, however, focuses on the opening of the new
parliament tomorrow, when a speaker, possibly a non-Socialist, will be
elected. Also, King Juan Carlos and party leaders will begin formal
consultations to propose a candidate for prime minister.
As leader of the biggest party in parliament, Mr Gonzalez is certain to be
the monarch's choice to form a government. He will face an investiture
debate, probably in mid-July, and should he obtain the confidence of the
house he will subsequently announce his cabinet.

SERBS and Croats launched at the weekend a joint offensive on Moslem-held
towns in central Bosnia as Croat commanders to the south announced an end to
war with the Serbs.
Sarajevo radio said dozens of people were killed on Saturday when Croat and
Serb forces shelled Maglaj, north of the Bosnian capital. The report could
not be independently confirmed.
In Sarajevo, seven people were killed when a mortar shell hit the old town
centre. The victims, whose ages ranged from four years to 22 years, had been
playing on the street, according to a local doctor.
Meanwhile, at Bijela kod Konjica in south-west Bosnia, Croat commanders
hailed a weekend agreement with local Serbs, their former enemies. 'The time
when the Croatian and Serbian soldiers look at each other down a barrel has
passed,' said commander Dragan Juric of the Croatian Defence Force (HVO) in
the Neretva river valley, the scene of some of the bloodiest Serbo-Croat
clashes of the 15-month war in Bosnia.
'The Croatian population and army in this area, faced with a Moslem
onslaught, simply would have been destroyed if the Serbs had not offered the
hand of salvation,' said commander Drago Simunovic Magda, according to
Tanjug, the Serbian news agency.
A tactical alliance between Bosnia's Croat and Serbs has emerged as both
sides, assuming they have the backing of some key members of the
international community, hasten the partition of the former Yugoslav
republic.
But at international talks in Geneva, Croat leaders have failed to reveal
their proposed map on the division of Bosnia. They are also seeking to
assert control over Serb-held territory in Croatia's south-west, which cuts
the republic in two. Remarks by General Janko Bobetko, the Croat army
chief-of-staff, over the weekend dismiss the possibility of a lasting truce
with the Serbs. 'It is only a pause for breath before the important events
which lie ahead,' Croatian radio reported him as saying.
'The world seems to have accepted Serbian conquests but Croatia cannot and
will not accept this.'
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman threatened at the weekend to cancel
hospitality to Bosnia's Moslem leaders. He said Moslem leaders had used
Zagreb as a base for meetings and links to the outside world, while accusing
them of 'open aggression and crimes towards the Croatian nation'.
Meanwhile, General Rasim Delic, commander of the Moslem-led Bosnian army,
warned of a 'general escalation' if his troops were subjected to further
joint attacks. He appealed to the UN to enforce a ceasefire agreed earlier
this month, Sarajevo radio reported.
Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators, will
meet today in Geneva with part of the Bosnian presidency, represented by
Croats, Serbs and a single Moslem.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic and two key Moslem allies are boycotting the session.
They believe the proposed three-way partition is a precursor to a two-way
carve-up and the annexation of Bosnia to neighbouring Serbia and Croatia.
The only Moslem representative attending the meeting is Mr Fikret Abdic, a
rival of Mr Izetbegovic who said he could be assassinated if he travelled to
Sarajevo.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Azerbaijan cancels big oil contract: Move coincides with
return to power of Brezhnev-era leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WESTERN oil companies are trying to decide how to respond to a sudden
government decision to cancel Azerbaijan's first big investment contract in
the strife-torn republic.
The abrupt cancellation was made after the companies had paid Dollars 70m
(Pounds 46.6m) in pre-signing bonuses.
The deal, which the oil companies had decided to pursue even after the
republic's elected president was stripped of his power, was for the
development of the ex-Soviet republic's estimated 4bn barrels of oil
reserves off its Caspian Sea coast.
The authorities have given no explanation for a decision to 'nullify' the
contract, which before President Abulfaz Elchibey fled the capital was due
to be signed on July 2. A consortium of eight western companies  - led by
British Petroleum and Amoco and Pennzoil of the US - was to develop three
fields containing all the country's proven reserves.
The other companies involved are Britain's Ramco Energy, Norway's Statoil,
the US's McDermott International and Union Oil of California, and the
Turkish Petroleum Company.
The acting government has not said what it will do next, short of promising
the companies that their money will be refunded.
Oil executives suggested the government may decide to alter the percentages
allotted to each company, negotiate an entirely new contract, or call for
new companies to apply.
One even speculated that some oil companies may even be using this month's
political upheaval to change the terms of the arrangements.
'We're waiting to see what direction the government takes now,' said one
executive, from the capital of Baku. 'The government is sophisticated enough
to know that if you try to take the money and hide with it, you'll cut
yourself off from new oil companies. They won't stand for something like
that.
'They have an obligation to us - we hope.'
The decision was taken by the government on Wednesday, only a day after it
accepted pre-signing bonuses.
It coincided with the return to power of the republic's Brezhnev-era leader,
Mr Heidar Aliyev. President Elchibey, who had given full backing to the
deal, has taken refuge in his home village and called the confiscation of
his powers a coup d'etat.
On Saturday night Mr Surat Husseinov, the leader of the mutiny which
facilitated Mr Aliyev's return to power, entered the capital to begin talks
with the latter, diplomats said.
Mr Husseinov, 35, a war hero who commands a private army estimated at more
than 3,000 men, has been demanding to be either president or prime minister,
with control over the republic's defence and interior ministries, and its
KGB.
Diplomats have expressed surprise that the 70-year-old Mr Aliyev has not
dispatched his younger rival and got him to accept a lesser position.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin's constitutional convention, which reconvened at the
weekend, is no closer to adopting a new constitution despite progress in
refining a draft text, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow.
Mr Yeltsin said one more plenary meeting of the convention was required to
finalise a draft but set no date for it. Many participants believe the new
constitution can only be adopted after parliamentary elections this autumn.
Parliament, meanwhile, officially boycotted the meeting, although several
deputies showed up.
The refined draft establishes reassuring checks on the president's powers,
following fears that the original draft could become a blueprint for
dictatorship.
A loose phrase allowing Mr Yeltsin or his successors to dissolve parliament
when a political crisis cannot be resolved by constitutional means has been
dropped.
The latest presidential draft also seeks to appease supporters of a rival
parliamentary draft, which is touted as being more socially just, by
incorporating a citizen's right to housing - even though economists might
deem this an unwise commitment on the part of a bankrupt state.
The main point of conflict now centres on defining the rights of Russia's 89
regions and republics. The new draft says the 22 republics, which are based
on ethnic minorities, are 'sovereign' while the regions, many of which are
richer and more powerful than republics, are just 'state formations'.
While some critics argue that calling the republics sovereign only panders
to separatist aspirations, some regions are upset at not being given an
equal status to republics.

<TEXT>
POLISH President Lech Walesa yesterday refused an invitation to attend a
Solidarity trade union convention after delegates decided not to support his
non-party bloc in September parliamentary elections, Reuter reports from
Zielona Gora.
Mr Walesa's spokesman said the president decided not to come to the congress
of the union he once led because the delegates had voted on whether Mr
Walesa should be invited at all.
'This is an unprecedented situation. If such actions are taken it is hard
for the president to consider that his presence is really necessary and
expected,' the spokesman told private Polish Radio Z.
The union sought to invite Mr Walesa to attend yesterday, a day after they
rejected his offer to join his newly-formed alliance of independent groups
and decided to submit their own candidates for the election on September 19.
At the congress in the south-western city of Zielona Gora, several
Solidarity delegates opposed inviting Mr Walesa who had hoped to win support
for his Non-Party Bloc of Support for Reforms (BBWR).
'It would be a Trojan horse at the congress. Mr Walesa has already begun his
election campaign for the BBWR,' Mr Tomasz Wojcik, a delegate, said.
Solidarity's participation in the BBWR - which Mr Walesa hopes will help the
next government force through economic reform - would have boosted the
bloc's chances of becoming an important force in parliament.
On Saturday 253 Solidarity delegates voted to run alone and only 28 wanted
to join Mr Walesa's alliance.
Many workers still regard the union as the force which is best able to
represent their interests.

<TEXT>
MR Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, yesterday did not rule out an
end to the arms embargo against Bosnian Moslems, although he reiterated the
arguments against such a policy.
'It may become inevitable,' he said, though he underlined his belief that
such a move would be the 'politics of despair', indicating an acceptance
among outside powers that there was no solution but to allow the warring
factions in Bosnia to fight it out.
On British television, Mr Hurd said that if peace negotiations broke down,
and the position of the UN forces in Bosnia became intolerable and they were
pulled out, then he could see some outside powers insisting they armed those
involved in the fighting.
He refused to be drawn on whether the UK would use its veto if the proposal
for lifting the embargo were put to the UN, but added that that point had
not yet been reached, since there was no majority on the Security Council in
favour of such a move.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Attack On Baghdad: US rallies behind Clinton's decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FEW weeks ago Mr Ross Perot, the billionaire businessman who stood as an
independent presidential candidate, was caught muttering that President Bill
Clinton was planning a war in the Balkans to take attention away from his
domestic difficulty.
No such accusation has been made after the latest strike on Iraq - not
because the president's fortunes have not recovered, which they have, to a
degree, but because of the peculiar place in current US demonology reserved
for President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
The Clinton administration has gone to some lengths to try to stress that it
is not as obsessed with Saddam the man as the administration of former
President George Bush seemed to be. But the presentation of sufficiently
persuasive evidence that Iraq was behind the foiled assassination attempt on
Mr Bush in Kuwait 10 weeks ago meant that the domestic political risks of
another raid on Baghdad were minimal.
Thus it was hardly surprising that, having seen Mr Clinton give a televised
address on Saturday night, Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, promptly
called the White House to express his support. Similar endorsements were
available across the political spectrum yesterday, including from Senator
Sam Nunn, the Democrat from Georgia and chairman of the armed services
committee who rarely has a good word to say for his president.
This domestic solidarity also enables the administration to address
criticisms from the Arab world contrasting the willingness to bomb Iraq with
the inability to come to the rescue of Bosnia's Moslems.
As Mr Les Aspin, the secretary of defence, put it yesterday, 'you can
understand why people feel this way'. But, he went on, there were quantum
differences between Bosnia and the transgressions of the Iraqi leadership.
'You'll find us picking and choosing' places where US retaliation might be
warranted, he added. 'Saddam Hussein', he went on, 'has not learned the
lesson of Desert Storm.' Similarly General Colin Powell, chairman of the
joints chiefs of staff, regretted any 'collateral damage' outside the Iraqi
intelligence headquarters in Baghdad, but argued that it was 'nothing
compared with the collateral damage Saddam Hussein was planning by possibly
killing a former president of the United States'.
The administration seems to have planned this operation with deliberation
and discretion. Mr Clinton himself took the decision on Friday but ordered
that it be carried out in the middle of the night to minimise casualties and
that it be delayed until after the Moslem sabbath, so as to avoid gratuitous
offence.
He acted only after sifting evidence provided by the FBI and the CIA. Ms
Janet Reno, the attorney general, and Mr Jim Woolsey, the CIA director, made
their formal reports to the president last Thursday. Contrary to recent
practice there were no leaks.
About a dozen US allies were informed privately in the 24 hours before the
raid took place. None apparently dissented and none was asked to offer
anything other than verbal support; Mr John Major, the British prime
minister, was the first to come forward shortly after missiles had hit
Baghdad.
The justification offered was Article 51 of the UN Charter - the right to
self defence. The action, according to Mr Aspin, 'in no way diminishes US
support for coalition action (against Iraq) or for the authority of the UN'.
The US immediately convened a UN Security Council session yesterday
afternoon to hear its case, which will be principally devoted to the attempt
on Mr Bush's life and not to the series of Iraqi violations of UN
resolutions.
In addition, several US officials, including the president, made much of the
need to combat state-sponsored terrorism, of which the US considers Iraq to
be a leading practitioner. Similar suspicions also attach to Sudan,
especially after the discovery last week in New Jersey of an alleged
terrorist cell numbering several Sudanese nationals with a list of targets
in New York. No comparable action, however, is believed to be planned
against Khartoum.
Although three cruise missiles missed their target, the claimed
effectiveness of the rest of the raid does not hurt the credibility of the
US military. The missiles were launched from warships in the Red Sea and the
Gulf and involved no other air or ground power. It probably does Mr Clinton
no harm to have authorised what appears to have been a successful strike.
His relations with his own military have been fraught over the defence
budget, base closings and the admission of homosexuals into service.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Attack On Baghdad: Saddam finds it's business as usual for
White House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST in case the rest of the world was in any doubt, Saturday night's
missile attack on Baghdad has underlined that, for the Clinton
administration, it is business as usual with Iraq.
The brief speculation during President Bill Clinton's first three months in
the White House that he might adopt a less confrontational response to the
provocations of President Saddam Hussein has been answered.
The Iraqi leader can now abandon any remaining hope that Mr Clinton would be
even marginally more accommodating than former President George Bush.
The message had already been clearly spelled out last month by Mr Martin
Indyk, the director for Near East and south Asian affairs at the National
Security Council. In a speech to the Washington Institute for Near East
Policy, Mr Indyk laid out the broad lines of US policy, a core part of which
was the perception that the threats posed by Iraq and Iran had at all costs
to be contained. Because the US was now the sole superpower in the region,
the need to sustain either country as a bulwark against the ambitions of the
other had gone. Both were to be treated equally as fundamental threats to US
interests in the Middle East.
Mr Indyk stressed that Washington did not seek or expect a reconciliation
with President Saddam's regime. 'Our purpose is deliberate,' he said. 'It is
to establish clearly and unequivocally that the current regime in Iraq is a
criminal regime, beyond the pale of international society and, in our
judgment, irredeemable.'
It is against that assessment that the missile attack on Iraq's intelligence
headquarters in Baghdad has to be seen. From the American perspective there
was a proven Iraq attempt on the life of Mr Bush, and the response was
appropriate.
The shortcomings of US policy are as obvious as ever. Since the third year
of the eight-year war with Iran, President Saddam has survived in large part
by posing as the saviour of his people against external aggression. The US
missile attack on a Baghdad suburb, which also killed civilians, is further
grist to his propaganda mill. It will probably not have weakened his grip on
power in any way, despite the impact of worsening economic conditions on the
majority of Iraqis.
In the wider region the reaction of Egypt, a key US ally in the Arab world,
reveals the nervousness of America's friends. 'I wish that American policies
were as strict towards the crimes the Serbs carry out against
Bosnia-Hercegovina, which violate all legitimacy and international
conventions,' said Mr Amr Moussa, Egyptian foreign minister. Others would
have added a string of other examples, most emphatically the US attitude
towards Israel's occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, the Golan Heights and
south Lebanon.
While the Clinton administration argues that it must contain the ambitions
of countries such as Iran and Iraq in order to make an Arab-Israeli peace
agreement possible, some of America's Arab friends believe it has the
opposite effect. They fear that the emotional impact on Arab populations of
US military strikes on Baghdad strengthens opponents of the peace process
and bolsters opposition groups, especially Islamic radicals, in countries
where governments are generally sympathetic to the west.
Equally, it will be used in Tehran by those factions within the regime which
are against any attempt to present a more tolerant face to the outside
world.
The Clinton administration has already identified Iran as the world's
foremost sponsor of terrorism. It has urged other governments to do
everything within their power to deny weapons to Iran and squeeze the
country economically, arguing it is vital to act now while Tehran's
ambitions still outstrip its capabilities.
The unproven assumption is that if the economic pips are squeezed hard
enough, populations will rise up and remove their political masters. Such
has not yet been shown to be the case in Iraq, and probably will apply
equally to Tehran, where the regime is no less vigorous in responding to any
internal challenges.
By linking the regimes of the two countries so simplistically, the US has
bitten off a large chunk of the Middle East with which to be in
confrontation. It is a policy which demands a substantial, continuing
military presence in the area and, no less critically, the wholehearted
support of its regional allies, primarily Saudi Arabia together with the
other five members of the Gulf Co-operation Council, and Egypt.
So while there is no love lost between Baghdad and Tehran, there is likely
to be a growing coincidence of interest between the two regimes in seeking
to undermine American policy at its most vulnerable - that is, among its
local allies. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has said several times that
Iran is behind the current wave of terrorism designed to destabilise his
government, while there have been renewed signs in Saudi Arabia of the
Islamic right flexing its political muscle.
The dominance of US military power conferred by the collapse of the Soviet
Union offers no answer to populist movements in the Middle East, and has
limited effect in weakening the hold of dictatorial governments. Yet, in the
absence of progress towards the resolution of long-standing Arab grievances,
primarily the Arab-Israel conflict, it will be seen in the region as the
primary tool of a selective American policy.
There was widespread disappointment among Arab peace negotiators at the
departure in January of Mr Bush, and that earlier of Mr James Baker, his
secretary of state. The two men had been credited with a genuine commitment
to securing a Middle East peace settlement acceptable to the Arabs, and a
readiness to twist Israeli arms.
Doubts persist whether that commitment is as fully shared by Mr Clinton and
Mr Warren Christopher.
If, after the latest attack on the Iraqi regime, it appears to many Arabs
that Mr Clinton has inherited Mr Bush's readiness for military action, but
less of his muscle in promoting a peace agreement, then hostility towards
the US in the Middle East is likely to grow.

<TEXT>
THE RESIDENTS of Baghdad seemed to have been taken by surprise. Sirens in
the city wailed at about 2am and minutes later there was the sound of what
seemed like explosions. Anti-aircraft fire was also heard.
But Baghdad had tested its sirens the previous day as the country
commemorated a victory in battle over Iran in the 1980-1988 war. Even after
a hugh blaze could be seen rising from the Mansour area about 3km from the
city centre, the streets remained almost empty of cars and the residents who
were out and about were surprised to hear that there had been an attack on
Baghdad.
People initially mistook the attack for a military exercises. 'It is an
exercise,' said one. 'They announced it today.'
Baghdad Radio continued normal programmes for nearly two hours before
switching over to national anthems.
There also had been no signs the authorities were expecting an attack.
Official newspapers had been empty of anti-US rhetoric and there had been no
sign that air defences were being strengthened.
By daylight, however, reality had sunk in. As dawn broke, the silence across
the city was broken by shouts of 'Allah Akbar' (God is great), and the
normal fears began to resurface. 'God, put an end to all this,' a woman
wailed.
'Does this mean they are going to hit us whenever they want?' said a
passer-by in the city's Bab al-Sharji district.
'I wonder whether Clinton will be satisfied with one strike,' a petrol
station worker said.
Then came the defiance. Soldiers on leave in a Baghdad garage were
unimpressed. 'It is peanuts,' one said. 'We have seen worse than that.'
Baghdad Radio said that the US 'will not be able to shake even a single
Iraqi palm leaf regardless of the treacherous power with which they came
this time.'
President Saddam's Revolution Command Council denounced the attack as
'cowardly aggression', which 'martyred several civilian citizens in houses
near the headquarters and wounded many others, including women and
children'. The US had 'continued to seek to fabricate crises and lies to
pursue their criminal policy against the Iraqi people'.
Ms Eleanor Biles, a Reuter TV producer, said she was having a drink with
some foreign aid workers in the Al Rasheed hotel, where most foreigners stay
in Baghdad, when the sirens sounded. She then heard a series of huge
explosions that went on for about 10 minutes.
In the hotel foyer, she said, people at first seemed in doubt as to whether
the attack had come from Iran or the US.
She said: 'As it became clearer that the US was behind the attack on Iraq's
intelligence headquarters, several Arab guests angrily stamped and jumped up
and down on the floor mural of President George Bush in the foyer.
'Several other hotel employees angrily asked me why there had been no
warning from the US.'

FT  28 JUN 93 / Attack On Baghdad: US Justice Department faces BNL case
disqualification call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A HIGHLY unusual legal motion will be filed in Atlanta today asking that the
entire US Department of Justice be disqualified from prosecuting the
long-running Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) Iraqi loans case, according to
court documents obtained by the Financial Times.
The 37-page request is being lodged with Judge Earnest Tidwell by lawyers
for Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former BNL manager whose Atlanta branch made
billions of dollars of loans that funded Baghdad's nuclear, chemical and
conventional weapons projects.
In the motion Mr Robert Simels, chief counsel to the former BNL man, calls
for the Justice Department to be disqualified because of alleged suppression
of evidence and conflicts of interest that 'transcend the appearance of
impropriety and evoke a sense of collusion and politically sensitive
prosecution'.
Mr Drogoul, who faces trial in September on charges of defrauding BNL's head
office in Rome over the Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) of Iraqi loans, is
pleading not guilty on the grounds that both BNL Rome and the US government
knew of the Iraqi loans. He was allowed to change his plea to innocent last
autumn after it emerged that the CIA had withheld key documents which
implicated BNL Rome in the scandal.
Today's motion details a September 15 1989 report by the Pentagon's Defence
Intelligence Agency (DIA) which speculated that 'the BNL mechanism was but a
part of a larger Nato strategy to ensure an Iraqi victory in its war with
Iran'. It also quotes from a January 31 1990 CIA memo which stated that
'managers at BNL headquarters in Rome were involved in the scandal'.
The filing alleges political interference by the Bush administration in the
BNL prosecution and calls for Judge Tidwell to ask Attorney-General Janet
Reno to seek a special prosecutor to take over the case from the Justice
Department.
A key section of the filing is the charge that US prosecutors suppressed
vital evidence provided in January 1991 by Mr Paul Henderson, the former
managing director of Matrix Churchill, the Coventry-based machine tools
company at the heart of Lord Justice Scott's arms-to-Iraq inquiry in
Britain.
Mr Henderson, who was selling to Iraq with funds from BNL Atlanta while also
briefing British intelligence services, was granted immunity from
prosecution in the US in 1991. Ms Gale McKenzie, the Atlanta prosecutor who
has handled the BNL case, recently attempted to revoke that immunity.
Today's court filing reveals that Mr Henderson told US prosecutors in
January 1991 that he had learned from Iraqi officials that 'Rome was fully
aware of BNL-Atlanta's dealings with Iraq, had approved of its dealings, and
that they were an extension of a government-to-government agreement between
Italy and Iraq'. If true, this would destroy the Justice Department's case
that Mr Drogoul, acting alone, defrauded the Rome head office.
The court filing discloses that Mr Henderson learned of Rome's involvement
from Mr Safa al-Habobi, an Iraqi official who was chairman of Matrix
Churchill and who was indicted in the BNL Atlanta case.
Bolstering today's request is the disclosure of a separate legal action
filed in April by the Justice Department which is alleged to contradict its
own case against Mr Drogoul because it suggests that BNL Rome might have
been guilty in the Iraqi loans case.
In that motion the Clinton administration argues that the US should suspend
for now any plans to reimburse BNL for Dollars 340m of Iraqi loans in
default.
These were backed by US government loan guarantees from the Commodity Credit
Corporation (CCC), the Department of Agriculture's export credit arm.
The reason cited by the Justice Department for not reimbursing the Italian
state bank is that 'it is evident that there is more than idle speculation
that evidence might evolve in Mr Drogoul's trial further implicating BNL and
raising obvious conflicts'.
Today's motion alleges it is a conflict of interest for the same entity  -
the Department of Justice - to try to prove Rome's ignorance and innocence
in order to convict Mr Drogoul while suspecting Rome's complicity in order
to save Dollars 340m.
The motion being filed today also argues that it was a conflict of interest
for BNL's own lawyers to have been allowed in 1989 to participate in a
criminal interrogation of Mr Drogoul by US Justice Department prosecutors.
The filing states that since BNL was itself a potential target of the US
investigation this defied 'all precepts of legal propriety'.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Election gains for Japan's LDP after party split
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S RULING Liberal Democratic party delivered a telling display of its
resilience by increasing its strength in elections to the Tokyo metropolitan
assembly yesterday.
The main opposition parties were devastated by the rise of the Japan New
party, a conservative group formed last year, which might occupy a pivotal
role as a potential coalition partner after the July 18 general election.
The results came at the end of a week in which the LDP has undergone its
most serious split since it rose to power 38 years ago, with 56 LDP
parliamentarians breaking away to form two new parties.
The Tokyo vote suggests that the general election, called after the LDP's
defeat in a no-confidence motion 10 days ago, will be extremely closely
fought. The main losers from the LDP's fracture might be the socialist
opposition, which may see its urban support decline markedly as voters
switch to new conservative parties.
About 9.3m people, almost 10 per cent of Japan's voting population, were
eligible to vote in the Tokyo elections, the first test of the LDP's
standing since the no-confidence vote. The results for the 128-seat city
assembly throw into question the widespread assumption that the LDP could be
defeated in the general election by a coalition of non-communist opposition
parties, including the LDP defectors.
The LDP increased its strength in the Toyko assembly from 42 to 44 seats in
the face of the deepest recession for 20 years, outcry over a string of
recent corruption scandals and last week's split.
The LDP's performance is all the more remarkable because the opposition
coalition has claimed it will rise to power by representing younger,
cosmopolitan voters in urban areas. The LDP vote is even more robust in
provincial and rural areas.
The Japan New party of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, a former regional governor,
increased its standing to 20 seats from two before the election.
The JNP rose by taking seats from the socialist opposition, splitting the
non-LDP vote.
The JNP has refused to join the opposition coalition fighting the general
election, but will not co-operate with the LDP.
The Tokyo vote suggests that the Social Democratic party might be the main
loser from the rise of the new conservative parties. The SDP lost 18 of its
32 Tokyo assembly seats.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Clinton hails strike on Iraq: UK and Germany back missile
raid as US reinforces Gulf presence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday hailed the weekend missile attack on Iraqi
intelligence headquarters in Baghdad as a 'success' which was more than
justified by a 'cowardly and loathsome' Iraqi plot to assassinate former
President George Bush.
At a special session of the United Nations Security Council last night the
US defended its action by invoking Article 51 of the UN charter, which
accords a nation the right to self-defence. Washington also reinforced its
military presence in the Gulf by moving the aircraft carrier Theodore
Roosevelt and a cruiser from the Adriatic.
Pentagon officials said that was a warning to President Saddam Hussein not
to retaliate or to attack the Kurds in the north of Iraq. There have been
reports of a substantial build-up of Iraqi forces near Kurdish territory.
In the attack, US warships several hundred miles away in the Red Sea and the
Gulf fired 23 cruise missiles at the Iraqi intelligence headquarters in the
heart of Baghdad. Three went wide, demolishing three homes in a residential
area and, according to Iraqi reports, killing six people.
Mr Clinton regretted any loss of civilian life. Mr Warren Christopher,
secretary of state, said the damage was minimal compared with the loss of
life that would have resulted had the Iraqi bomb aimed at Mr Bush when he
visited Kuwait in April been detonated.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, backed the US action, describing
it as 'a justified act of self-defence'. UK opposition politicians, however,
expressed severe reservations that the US had acted without consulting the
UN.
Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, said US attack was the correct
reaction to 'a detestable terrorist attempt'.
Italy and France were more circumspect, limiting themselves to expressions
of 'understanding' for the motivation behind the raid.
There was criticism from Arab nations and from Iran. Egypt said it wished
the US would show the same concern for Moslems in Bosnia, and Jordan warned
that the US attack would only lead to more 'hatred, human and material
losses'.
The Arab League accused the US of applying double standards and expressed
extreme regret at the assault. Among Arab nations, only Kuwait voiced
support.
In Iran, the parliamentary foreign relations committee said the strike was
'an open international act of aggression which cannot be justified on the
basis of any international treaties and agreements'.
At last night's Security Council meeting US ambassador Madeleine Albright
displayed photographs which she said gave proof of an Iraqi attempt to
assassinate Mr Bush. The photographs were said to be of a car bomb and other
devices hidden in a Toyota Landcruiser smuggled across the Iraq-Kuwait
border.
Some of the explosive devices uncovered were found only in Iraqi components
and were not used by any other terrorist group, Mrs Albright said.
Other explosives which had been seized, including so-called cube bombs,
contained components built by the same people who had made similar devices
that were recovered previously from the Iraqi intelligence service.
Mr Nazir Hamdoon, the Iraqi delegate, flatly denied the charges, which he
called a Kuwaiti fabrication. However, those members who spoke during the
hour-long debate were clearly convinced US reprisals were justified and the
Council adjourned without taking formal action.
In Washington, Mr Christopher, Mr Les Aspin, defence secretary, and General
Colin Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, praised the accuracy of
the US attack.
They said it was vital to strike against state-sponsored terrorism. The
secretary of state expressed particular concern that Iran, which he said was
also responsible for aiding terrorists, was acquiring and building weapons
of mass destruction. Some US allies were doing 'far too much trading' with
Iran, and he urged them to put up 'a stern front' against Iranian military
ambitions.
There was no discernible domestic opposition to the US raid.
In Britain, Mr Major's full backing for the US was in contrast to opinion in
other parties. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said he had 'grave doubts'
about the wisdom and legality of the missile attack.
Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, warned that in the
long-term the attack might be very damaging to the status and authority of
the UN.

FT  28 JUN 93 / Row intensifies over political donations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR WAS forced on to the defensive yesterday in the continuing row over
party funding, with the leadership preparing for the quick return of Pounds
11,000 donated by a businessman wanted for questioning by the Serious Fraud
Office.
The Conservative party also faced fresh embarrassment, following more claims
over the weekend about large-scale, secret funding from prominent foreign
businessmen. Names linked to the Tory party as big donors included Mr T. T.
Tsui, the Hong Kong businessman, and Mr Octav Botnar, the former chairman of
Nissan UK. The Inland Revenue has issued a warrant for the arrest of Mr
Botnar, who is safe from extradition in Switzerland.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour deputy leader, gave an assurance that the party
would return Pounds 11,000 donated in 1987 and 1990 by Mr Charilaos Costa, a
Greek Cypriot businessman, if it was found to be stolen. She denied press
allegations that funds had also been given by Mr Costa to the office of Mr
Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader.
But it seems likely that this Wednesday's meeting of Labour's national
executive committee will decide to return the Pounds 11,000 without delay.
Mrs Beckett also said it was 'about as near certain as you can get' that her
party would now decide unilaterally to disclose details of all 'substantial'
donations. Labour has previously maintained that it would do so only if
other parties agreed, but a change to its rules now looks likely in the
autumn.
While Labour believes that its message on 'sleaze' in Tory party funding has
been effective, some of its MPs believe that the intensified public
disillusion with politicians generally has damaged opposition parties as
well.
Some also believe it unfortunate that the issue has been a further example
of the party reacting to Tory mistakes rather than focusing the agenda on
areas where Labour could be seen in a positive light.
Ministers insist that the party does not intend to alter the rules which
provide anonymity to all financial backers, although a growing number of
Tory MPs now support publication of more detailed Tory accounts.
Lord Parkinson, a former party chairman, yesterday backed the idea, saying
he believed 'in having these things out in the open'.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, defended the right of
contributors not to have their donations publicised. He claimed that they
had no influence on party policy or on the choice of candidate. He repeated
the pledge to return Pounds 440,000 given to the party by Mr Asil Nadir, the
fugitive businessman, if it was proved to be stolen, while Lord McAlpine,
the former Tory treasurer, said the money should be put in trust until its
source was established.

FT  28 JUN 93 / BOC adopts Visa cards to speed small bill payment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOC, ONE of Britain's biggest industrial groups, is issuing Visa charge
cards to managers to simplify and speed up payment of all small bills
incurred by its UK gases business.
In an initiative which is provoking widespread interest among other large UK
businesses, BOC's gases division has issued cards to purchasing managers at
30 local centres, enabling them to settle any invoices of up to Pounds 250
each.
The ceiling for a transaction, covering everything from vehicle parts to
office equipment, may soon rise to Pounds 1,000. The business has about
8,000 suppliers.
The scheme, now being brought in nationally after a 12-month trial period,
has led to immediate cost savings for BOC of Pounds 200,000 a year. Further
reductions in overheads are expected. Most suppliers have welcomed the move,
which means their bills are being settled within 10 days, on average - many
within half that.
Bills totalling Pounds 1m a year are already being settled by BOC under the
new system, which is proving so successful that it may be adopted by other
parts of BOC's business. The group's industrial gas business in Europe has
annual sales of nearly Pounds 500m a year, mostly in the UK.
Managers have been given individual credit limits, rising as high as Pounds
25,000. Visa charges a fee for each card, but there are no interest charges
for BOC as card debts are paid on demand.
The initiative, which might make a significant contribution towards
combating late payment of bills, follows an analysis by BOC showing that 60
per cent of its purchase and invoice matching activities involve
transactions of less than Pounds 250 each. Collectively, however, they
account for only 3 per cent of purchasing expenses.
Mr Trevor Rock, BOC gases divisional controller responsible for the scheme,
said the intention was to 'end the purchasing manager's nightmare' of
handling huge volumes of paperwork for low-value transactions. He added: 'It
can also work wonders for suppliers' cash flow. The question of chasing for
payment becomes a thing of the past.'
BOC expects that charge cards to pay day-to-day corporate bills will become
normal within the next five years. The company has already made
presentations on its new system to businesses including IBM, National Power,
Esso and the Post Office.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Motoring: Ford puts on the style for estates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOOD-LOOKING estate cars have joined Ford's Mondeo range. The subtly-curved
rear end makes the estate's styling far less anonymous than that of the
saloons and hatchbacks.
The re-designed independent rear suspension is exclusive to the estate car.
It minimises intrusion so successfully that Ford claims the Mondeo has a
class-leading load space volume (58.3 cubic feet) and a load floor length
(73.5 in/184 cm) which is virtually the same as a Volvo 940.
All estates cost Pounds 1,000 more than their saloon or hatchback
equivalents. Prices range from Pounds 12,835 for a 1.6-litre LX to Pounds
14,155 for the 1.8-litre GLX and Pounds 18,450 for a 2.0-litre Ghia.
This flagship model comes with ABS brakes, alloy wheels, self-levelling rear
suspension and air-conditioning as standard. Most of these features can be
had as extra-cost options on other Mondeo estates.
A traction control system is available only on the two-litre models, but
every Mondeo Estate has a driver's side air bag and power steering. At
present, buyers get a pleasant five-speed manual gearbox without the option,
but on their way are automatics and four-wheel drives (although these will
have manual transmission only).
Before that come 1.8-litre turbo-diesels, which should perform at least as
well as Mondeo estates with 1.6-litre petrol engines.
Even the cheapest 1.6-litre LX has 60:40 split folding rear seats, a load
space cover, and tie-downs to stop heavy things sliding forward should you
have to make a panic stop.
YOU ARE driving along a motorway in pouring rain when, suddenly, the
steering becomes suspiciously light. Turning the wheel produces no response.
Your front tyres are aquaplaning. Instead of biting on the tarmac, they are
riding on a film of water that the grooves and slots of the tread pattern
cannot clear away fast enough.
Aquaplaning is alarming and potentially lethal. Mostly, it happens when you
hit a long puddle or a sheet of water streaming sideways across a road. But
continuous aquaplaning conditions can occur for hundreds of yards on level
but poorly-drained road surfaces in a deluge.
The faster you go, the greater the risk. Many unexplained wet-weather
accidents of 'the car just went into a skid' variety are because of
aquaplaning, especially if the tyres have wide treads and are well worn.
The best way to avoid aquaplaning is, of course, to slow down when it rains
cats and dogs. But risks can be lessened by choosing a tyre like Goodyear's
new Aquatred, which has just gone on sale in European markets, including
Britain.
At a glance, the deep drainage channel in the middle of the tread makes the
Aquatred looks like two very narrow tyres side by side. This channel lets a
lot of water flow through the tyre's footprint, with the surplus pumped out
to the side through slots. These are so curved that the Aquatred is a
one-way tyre; a big arrow on the side wall shows the direction of rotation.
The 'twin tyre' principle has been used before on tyres for vehicles with
very high performance, but the Aquatred is the first aimed at cars like
Golfs and Mondeos, Peugeot 405s and Rover 400s. It costs about 7 per cent
more than a conventional summer-pattern tyre, but reduces the risk of
aquaplaning considerably .
At Goodyear's Mireval proving ground near Montpellier, France, last week, I
watched two family hatchbacks drive round a 200-metre circle with a 30-metre
segment flooded by 8mm of water. One car was on normal tyres, the other on
Aquatreds. At about 60 kph (37 kph), both kept on line when hitting the
water. As speed rose, one ran wider and wider until, at 85 kph (53 mph), it
aquaplaned out of control. But not the car with Aquatreds.
I then drove several Aquatred-shod cars on Mireval's handling circuit. In
the dry, they rode, steered and handled as they would on the best normal
tyres. On a surface like that of a winding country road during a summer
downpour, the Aquatreds let me corner and brake as though it were merely
damp.
Ideally, Aquatreds - which will last as long as tyres with conventionally
patterns - should be fitted in sets but you could start with a pair on the
back wheels. They are a logical choice for motorists who give wet-weather
safety high priority.

FT  26 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Warburg stake cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent Footsie entrant SG Warburg was the most heavily traded stock in the
London market as one stakeholder cut its holding to 4.9 per cent, marking a
footnote to the hostile takeover threat that dogged the merchant bank seven
years ago.
Canadian National Railway Pension Fund Trust reduced its stake from 12 per
cent, selling 15.1m shares at 705p a share to Cazenove and UBS which placed
them in the market at 712p a share. Canadian National took the original
stake in late 1986 from Mr Paul Steinberg's Reliance Insurance which sold
the shares when it despaired of being able to launch a hostile bid. The
pension fund paid almost Pounds 100m for its shares then, a hefty premium to
the market value, and yesterday sold the seven per cent for Pounds 106.5m.
Underlying Warburg shares fell 12 to 727p with 37m traded.
Abbey National suffered a profit downgrade by NatWest securities. The house
cut its current year forecast by Pounds 27m to Pounds 640m to reflect higher
than previously expected provisions in Europe and a fall in mortgage
applications later this year. The shares were down 4 at one stage but
rallied to close 2 weaker at 410p.
Royal Bank of Scotland eased 1 1/2 to 288p as Hoare Govett reiterated its
sell stance.
Oil group Burmah Castrol recovered from recent falls closing 6 1/2 higher at
716 1/2 p.
ICI was weaker as the recently demerged chemicals group announced at its
annual meeting that business conditions in continental Europe remained poor
in spite of recovery signs in some markets. However, the company's chief
executive Mr Ronnie Hampel hit out at the recent rash of downgrades saying:
'I don't understand what the analyst community is about. We have not changed
our stance right the way through.'
Health care products company London International Group closed lower on
balance as the company reported a profit of Pounds 27.89m after exceptionals
against analysts' forecasts of around Pounds 33m. The headline figure was
well up on the previous year and the company made a positive statement but
the output from LIG's photo-processing arm was even more disappointing than
anticipated. The shares closed 6 lower at 176p although Hoare Govett
remained positive focusing on the yield and arguing that the company was
'managing well in a very difficult environment'.
Against a largely flat sector Boots continued a modest climb, adding 5 1/2
to 450p. GUS 'A', subject of enfranchisement hopes recently, enjoyed the
fillip of a Nomura buy note and improved 4 to 1763p. Courts, one of the
market's star performers this week after good results, moved its rise on the
week to 114 and ended the day at 632p. It also benefited from the
recommendation of NatWest.
Food manufacturers' shares went their separate ways with dairy-related
issues mixed despite market belief that a milk price rise had been agreed
between the Milk Marketing Board and the supermarkets. In reasonable volume
of 3.4m for a quiet day Northern Foods added 3 to 276p while Unigate gave up
2 to 344p. Unigate had suffered from market doubts over progress at
Nutricia, a Dutch baby food and nutrition company of which it owns a third,
but these were stemmed by the end of trading.
The chancellor's hints at possible higher taxes in the November Budget
summoned the spectre of higher food levies to the market and depressed a
couple of large retailers, according to one analyst. Sainsbury lost 11 to
close at 488p and Tesco gave up 5 to 215p. Another blamed the performances
on a generally weak sector and investors seizing the chance to exit after a
reasonably buoyant period. Tesco denied press reports of a boardroom battle.
The market responded enthusiastically to an announcement by David S. Smith,
the paper and packaging manufacturer, that it is buying Spicers Group, the
office products wholesaler, for Pounds 95m, raising the cash via a
one-for-four offer at 305p a share. A bullish profit forecast by the company
helped the shares rise 16 to 359p.
Bid speculation and general confidence boosted some northern brewers. Hardys
and Hansons, the Nottingham-based company, moved ahead 16 to 247p. Joseph
Holt, the Manchester-based family concern, advanced 50 to close at 3075p.
Greene King was not so fortunate: the shares lost 13 to 516p with dealers
attributing the fall to a stock overhang.
Generally, the sector was in retreat with Whitbread 'B' the only large stock
to show buoyancy - putting on 18 to 998p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Difficult trading conditions in the second half affected the full year's
performance at Syltone, the transport engineering group.
The pre-tax profit worked through at Pounds 909,000 for a total of Pounds
2.13m for the year ended March 31 1993, compared with Pounds 2.87m.
Mr Tony Clegg, chairman, said the first quarter of the current year had been
'more encouraging'. He saw positive signs of an upturn in the US, while at
home the 'worst is behind us'. Continental Europe, however, remained
difficult.
Turnover rose to Pounds 36.7m (Pounds 35m) with overseas accounting for
Pounds 20.2m (Pounds 18.3m). Earnings per share came to 15.03p (22.22p) and
the dividend is held at 9.45p with a final of 6.3p.
Also proposed is a 1-for-1 scrip issue.

FT  26 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Willoughby's dives
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the six months ended March 31 1993 pre-tax profit of Willoughby's
Consolidated dived from Pounds 1.59m to Pounds 225,000.
In line with distributing the maximum amount of cash remitted from the
Zimbabwean operations, the interim dividend is halved to 0.5p. Earnings fell
to 2.8p (14.9p). The directors warned that the final was likely to be
reduced from the 1.5p paid last time.
Lower profits reflected reduced gold production, increased mine working
costs and a delayed cattle slaughter season.
The outlook was better, with higher production anticipated at the mines, a
stronger USDollars price of gold and high slaughter prices for cattle.
Comparisons have been restated for FRS 3, and the profit pushed up by Pounds
109,000 on a change of accounting policy for livestock.

FT  26 JUN 93 / UK Company News: David Smith paying Pounds 95m to buy
Spicers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVID S SMITH, the paper and packaging group, is to buy Spicers, the UK's
largest wholesaler of office products, from Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget
of Sweden, for Pounds 95m.
The deal is to be financed via the issue of 31m shares at 305p, or 38p below
the closing price on Thursday night. The price fell after the announcement
but finished 16p up at 359p.
Smith also estimated pre-tax profits for the year ending May 1 would be
Pounds 27.1m, up from Pounds 15.4m after exceptional items. The group is
recommending a 7.25p final dividend, giving 10p for the year (9.5p).
The deal marks a return for chief executive Mr Peter Williams to Spicers
which he sold for more than Pounds 250m to SCA in 1990, when he held a
similar position at Reedpack, the management buy-out from Reed
International.
Mr Williams said the deal would be marginally dilutive in 1993-94 but would
enhance earnings thereafter. Smith is buying Spicers at an 11.3 earnings
multiple.
In addition to the UK operations, which made Pounds 12m operating profit
from sales of Pounds 227m in 1992, Spicers has a lossmaking French
operation. Mr Williams was responsible for developing the business but says
recently 'management lost complete control of the business'.
On sales of FFr359.3m in 1992, Spicers France made an operating loss of
FFr45.4m. Mr Williams said he was not yet sure the division could be turned
round but there were no current plans to close it.
If it was closed, however, the acquisition would enhance Smith's earnings in
1993-94. And closure would cost Pounds 10m implying a 12.5 multiple.
Spicers supplies about 10 per cent of the office products market and 50 per
cent of the wholesale distribution of office products. It also makes
envelopes and other stationery products in the UK.
On Smith's results to May 1, Mr Williams said a strong performance from
Kaysersberg Packaging in France, acquired in 1991, had been offset by an
overall deterioration in the results of the UK paper and packaging
industries due to pressure on margins.
German recycling legislation continued to distort the European waste paper
markets, allowing continental recycling companies a ready supply of cheap
recycled material.
Mr Williams said immediate prospects in the UK were encouraging. The first
half would , however, be affected by the scheduled three month closure of
one of the three paper machines at Kemsley.
The placing, which is subject to a 1-for-4 clawback for shareholders, is
underwritten by SG Warburg. The brokers are Credit Lyonnais Laing.

FT  26 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Heron sells Sunderland shopping centre for
Pounds 39m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERON International, Mr Gerald Ronson's property and trading group which is
hoping to gain creditors' approval of a Pounds 1.4bn refinancing plan next
Monday, has sold a shopping centre in Sunderland for Pounds 39m, to Land
Securities. The price was above the value assumed for the property in the
business plan.
Mr Ronson is expected to tell creditors at Monday's meeting that more than
another Pounds 100m of disposals have been lined up, also at prices above
book value, and ahead of schedule.
The success of the business plan depends on property values recovering. Mr
Ronson said the disposal 'is an indication of our ability to achieve
excellent values for creditors.' He added: 'I am confident that we will
improve upon the values at which the property portfolio has been assumed in
the business plan. The UK investment property market is showing the first
signs of recovery.'
The restructuring proposals have been approved by Heron's 82 banks but there
is some opposition from bondholders and other creditors.
The shopping centre, called The Bridges, comprises 80 units with annual
rents totalling Pounds 3.2m, giving an initial yield of over 8 per cent.

CLUB Mediterranee, the French holiday group, suffered a sharp decline in
attributable net profits, to FFr2m (Dollars 350,000) in the six months to
April, from FFr20m a year ago, writes Alice Rawsthorn.
The group, which blamed its poor performance on the 'bad economic
environment', would have suffered an even steeper setback but for an
accounting change which raised net profits before minorities by FFr46m.
The US business improved in the first half of this year, but the group was
hit by difficulties in Egypt and Senegal.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Rightwing whites storm SA conference centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCORES of armed South African rightwing whites yesterday stormed the
country's constitutional conference centre outside Johannesburg with an
armoured car in an attempt to halt negotiations on the country's democratic
future.
About 1,000 heavily armed police took little action against the members of
the Afrikaner Volksfront who beat up black women delegates and journalists,
and daubed the walls of the negotiation chamber with slogans demanding an
Afrikaner homeland and accusing the ruling National party of treason.
Terrified delegates fled, leaving about 100 men and women, - all toting
weapons  - occupying the chamber where South Africa's first multiracial
constitution is being written. About 3,000 more waited outside.
President FW de Klerk vowed to make quick arrests, while Mr Nelson Mandela,
president of the African National Congress, called for the immediate
detention of rightwing leaders, saying the arrest of junior people would not
be sufficient.
'The first arrests will take place maybe tonight, tomorrow. Immediate action
is being planned,' Mr de Klerk said after supporters of the Afrikaner
Volksfront had smashed through the glass doors of the centre with the
vehicle and stormed the chamber where negotiators were debating an end to
white minority rule.
Mr Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha Freedom party leader, condemned the raid as
'totally and utterly reprehensible'.
Many protesters cited the fact that, on the eve of the assault,
constitutional negotiators had voted by an overwhelming majority to deny the
demand of the rightwing Conservative party (which represents ultra-radical
whites) for Afrikaner 'self-determination' in a separate white state.
Every protester had his own justification for the attack.
Young Johan Cronje, carrying a flag of the old Boer republic of the
Transvaal, insisted that 'all we're asking for is land. If you don't have
land, how can you live?' while Fred Rundell, a member of the Volksfront
executive, drew a parallel with the liberation of eastern Europe. 'What
happened here today was a spontaneous uprising of the people like what
happened in Romania,' he argued.
Within hours, the 26-party negotiating forum was back in business, with the
chamber walls repainted and even the Conservative party (which helped lead
the attack) seated at its accustomed place.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Facing up to being second rate: Why Britons have delusions
of sporting grandeur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN, we are constantly being told, has not yet come to terms with no
longer being a world power. How much truer this is of our sporting prowess,
as the events of the past few weeks have demonstrated.
I have just returned from a visit to our last colony, Hong Kong, and the
shock waves of the England soccer team's defeat at the hands of the US could
be felt on the shores of the South China Sea.
Among the British community in Hong Kong such a disgrace was felt far more
keenly than obscurely distant rumblings of domestic discontent about John
Major's leadership.
I flew back just in time to attend the Saturday of the Lord's Test against
Australia, supposedly the highlight of the English cricket season. By the
end of the afternoon, as the England batsmen fell more than 400 runs short
of the Australian total, I wished that my flight had been delayed for 12
hours.
The England supporters around me sat silent. The press, of course, observed
no such restraint, and the sports writers since then have been vying with
each other in their own private competition to see which of their number
could most offend the England cricket selectors.
There, I am afraid, lies the heart of our problem. The pundits who are paid
to tell us what we think about England cricket, seem unable to believe that
the team might possibly be less talented, simply worse, than any other
nation. Their writings are based on the false premise that England are the
premier cricketing nation and that it is only the stupidity of selectors and
managers which prevents us from demonstrating this to upstart colonials.
If only, they moan, we had not selected Smith, Gatting and Lewis and instead
picked Lathwell, Thorpe and Igglesden, then we would have been all right.
We seem unable to accept, gracefully and sportingly, that Australian batsmen
such as Michael Slater and Mark Taylor might just be better than anything we
can produce; that no matter how cleverly our team is selected, we are
destined to lose to a better side. The same disease afflicts England's
soccer pundits.
If England ever lose an international match, it cannot be that a foreign
nation actually has a higher class of player. No: it must be that great
talent has been inadequately harnessed by a bad manager. An inability to
come to terms with Britain's decline as a world power on the political stage
is somehow more understandable.
Britain was, in trading and naval terms, the greatest empire the world had
seen. We are justified in being discomfited by our fall into mediocrity,
even if it has been happening for 100 years or more.
But in sport we have no such excuse for delusions of grandeur. Englishmen
imagine that they were once a great footballing power. In fact England have
only once won the World Cup, and that on home territory with the aid of a
Russian linesman.
Why should England not lose at soccer to the US, a vastly more populous and
resourceful country? It is not even as though we field a British soccer
team, which would benefit from the skills of the Celtic fringes. Instead
Britain continues to imagine that it has the resources and talent to field
not one but four separate international sides.
As for cricket, the Ashes, for which England compete against Australia, are
themselves a symbol of our sporting eclipse and, in the 100 or so years
since, Britons have consistently been found wanting by the country of
Bradman and Border.
Perhaps it is only in lawn tennis, another of the games we invented without
working out the humiliating consequences, that we are realistic.
At Wimbledon we accept that defeat can be heroic, and that victory is not a
right. Does it matter that England is a second rate sporting nation?
One person to whom it undoubtedly does matter is John Major, the prime
minister. How much better it would be for him if, just for once, he could be
identified with success.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Private View: Hard times but still no hard sell for a dealer
of the old school
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS lounged in booths tricked out like Mayfair drawing rooms, staring at
the tanned legs of Girl Fridays sashaying down the aisles. Among the
Sainsbury bag-carriers the occasional shopping queen stood out  - mane of
hair, gold bangles, her decorator dancing attendance. It was June, the peak
of the London selling season, and a stiflingly quiet day at the Olympia
antiques fair.
Halfway down one aisle, beside a nude Apollo, I found the exotically-styled
Edric Van Vredenburgh, the very picture of an antique dealer with his
grizzled beard, pony-tail, humorous eyes and morose expression.
The way he talked about the recession prompted the question: so how is your
business different to running a hardware store?
'It's not any more.' He became emotional. 'It's not. That's just the point.
When I first came into the business you could be an antique dealer first.
You bought and it was  - this is a very important word  - fun. You could
enjoy it. You worked hard. I worked six days a week, seven days a week. I
enjoyed it. I made a living. I didn't make a fortune. But I had a lot of
fun.
'Now, you have to be an accountant, you have to be a tax consultant, you
have to know about foreign exchange. It's hard.'
Why don't you pack it up altogether?
'Can't afford to. I've got to make a living. Having done it for 30 years
it's what I know how to do best.'
Like any businessman in a recession  - and more prudent than some  - Van
Vredenburgh began running down his Pounds 500,000 inventory and paying off
his overdraft 18 months ago. Now in the clear, he has further decided to
give up his little gallery in Bury Stret, St. James's, at the heart of the
London antique trade, and deal from his house in Portobello Road instead.
Why?
'Selling costs a lot of money today, especially in this city. The wheel
clamp is a nightmare, parking is a nightmare, rates are a nightmare and
rents are a nightmare.'
Worse still, people were not coming to London any more. By 'people', Van
Vredenburgh means Americans. What about the Japanese? 'Their houses are too
small to accommodate antiques.' He blamed the big auction houses for
shortening their selling season, suggesting that Sotheby's and Christie's
were more interested in New York, Monte Carlo and Geneva than London. 'They
are more like real estate agents than antique auction houses now, more
accountant-driven than expert-driven.'
It is the kind of stock-in-trade pessimism you would expect from a farmer
grumbling in his Jag. The fact is that Van Vredenburgh, 48, is also
beginning to feel his years.
'I've got to an age where I know there are other things than dealing in
antiques,' he said finally.
What are they?
'Well, people, among other things. Working with people, enjoying people's
company. There was a little notice quoted in a newspaper last year about a
gallery in St. James's that said 'Gone mushroom picking or fishing'. It
happened to be me. I rather enjoy mushroom picking. If you have to run a
gallery you don't have time to do things like that.
'And I want time to travel as well. I'm a hundred per cent an antique
dealer. When I'm abroad I like to look at a museum or a house. It's
important to do that. You're learning the whole time. I've realised in the
last eight to ten years how little I do know.'
Are there other reasons for giving up the gallery?
'Yes. You find less things.' In auctions that week he had found barely half
a dozen things worth looking at and only one he really wanted, a circus
painting, estimated at Pounds 6,000 to Pounds 8000. 'I went to sixteen and a
half. It went to eighteen. I wasn't even the underbidder.'
He suggested another reason for pessimism: Aids. He has noticed that some of
his best clients, homosexual decorators from America, have just disappeared.
On the other hand the financial disaster of the Lloyd's insurance market,
which this week reported a Pounds 2.9bn loss for 1990, will bring a lot of
antiques on to the market. The Antiques Road Show on television has flushed
objects out of attics. But the trade had become too commercialised.
'Everything is an antique, from a Dinky toy to a Roman sculpture. As soon as
the money-men get hold of anything they do it to death.'
It seemed odd for an antique dealer to disparage money-men. Are you a
typical dealer? I asked him.
'No. I'm probably more extrovert than most, in the way I express myself, in
my behaviour, in the objects I buy.'
I thought all dealers were showmen and wheeler-dealers, I said.
'Some may be. I hope I'm not any of those things. I would hate ever to be
called a wheeler-dealer.'
This dealer is descended on his father's side from Dutch burgomeisters who
emigrated to the US in the 17th century. His mother's family were Russian
Jewish refugees. The son, academically weak but visually acute, was a
frustrated architect who at the age of 17 joined his father, a former
entomologist at the British Museum who had gone into porcelain.
Father and son fell out 15 years ago but have made it up since. 'Probably if
I'd gone to work for someone else first our attitudes to each other would
have been different,' Van Vredenburgh said. 'It's a typical father-son
thing.'
He considers himself a small dealer. The most he has paid for an object is
Pounds 100,000, for a 16th century marble bust of the Roman emperor Commodus
at the Castle Howard sale last year. But what sort of dealer?
'I've been asked that question many times. It's been said I have an eclectic
taste. I like beautiful objects, I like a beautiful painting, a beautiful
piece of furniture, a beautiful piece of pietro duro, and sculpture.'
Do you buy only things you like yourself?
'Generally speaking, yes. When I say I buy for me, I buy first, I hope, with
knowledge, second with taste  - my taste  - and then I hope the client likes
my taste.'
Have you anything you wouldn't ever sell?
'Not now. If you'd asked me that question five years ago I would have said
yes. I've got quite a few things at home I've had for more than 10 years,
some even for 20 or 25.'
Are you sentimental?
'Not about the objects.'
Do you ever get sick of objects?
'For a while, sometimes. But then something comes up and it does something
to you. I think more than the pot of gold, the great bargain, the big
windfall, you get your excitement from the really beautiful or interesting
thing you come across occasionally.'
What about people? Are you hard-hearted with them?
'I can be both. If I don't like someone I can be very tough. If I like
somebody I think I'm pretty soft. I have both sides to my character. I mean,
I've fallen out with a lot of antique dealers because I don't like their
attitude. I don't like dishonesty. For the first time in a long time I am
suing someone who owes me money. I'm only doing it because the person
wouldn't discuss it.'
I asked about stolen goods. 'It's not something I come across very often.
There were people that one knew in London who imported things from Italy,
for example, that were almost certainly stolen. It is usually easy to tell,
and word soon gets round.' But once he was offered a half share in a bronze
head which he discovered had been stolen from a church in the City.
How does a buyer know if he's dealing with a rogue?
'How would he know if he goes to someone who's advising him on stocks and
shares? He jolly well goes and finds the right person. If you just walk into
a shop you don't know. If you are spending money you find out about the
person you're spending money with.
'The problem with a lot of clients is they don't expect the person giving
them advice to earn money from it. What are they in business for? Most
people who have money to spend make it in business in some form or another.
They expect to be paid, and usually quite well. But when it comes to
spending money they'll spend it very freely without getting advice and then
moan about it afterwards.'
Do you bargain?
'I'll discuss, yes, why not? I prefer not to. It depends on the client.
Personally, I prefer to know my client and say I want such-and-such a price.
That's it. I don't want to have a big fight.
'On the other hand there are some people who will never  - never  - pay the
price you ask them.'
The richer people were, the more they disliked talking about when they would
pay. Such talk they considered vulgar. 'So I have this 'when-do-you-pay
price'.'
Van Vredenburgh said his mark-up varies from 30 to 100 per cent depending on
the object. 'To average 100 per cent is very rare in this trade, in spite of
what punters think.' Bargains, too, were rare. 'You could not base a
business on them.'
Have you made a lot of money?
'I've made a living, not piles in the bank. A good living, but I still have
to work.'
What would make you give up altogether?
'I don't think I could altogether. There's still enough to enjoy. It gets
less and less, but still enough. If I did extremely well  - when I say that
I mean if I had between a million and five in one fell swoop, I would have
no doubt about moving aside and spending far less time on it.
'It's like any other business: keep your eyes open, keep changing, be
modern. I've given up the shop before. I might open a shop again, who
knows?'

FT  26 JUN 93 / As They Say in Europe: Oh, for the good old days
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WESTERN EUROPE enters the 1990s with a new-found confidence that would have
seemed fanciful only a couple of years ago. Gone are the pessimism and talk
of 'Eurosclerosis' bred by chronically rising joblessness. Instead,
confidence has returned, employment expansion has resumed and investment has
surged.'
This passage from the February 1990 edition of World Financial Markets,
published by the bank, JP Morgan, is not reproduced in any spirit of malice
or Schadenfreude (tee hee) but as a reflection of how people saw things in
those distant days. The Copenhagen summit showed how distant they are.
As Die Welt put it: 'Nobody thought that the blooming European economy would
fall behind the US and Japan. So that brings up a painful question: will
Europe refuse this challenge, just as it did the conflict in Yugoslavia? The
20m unemployed in the EC destroys the reputation of one of the great world
economic organisations which sang to its citizens of the welfare-promise of
the internal market and the Union-anthem of the 'splendid times' of
Maastricht.'
As Die Welt noted, and JP Morgan said at the time, the optimism of those
days was based on the belief that the single market could solve most of the
economic problems while the collapse of of communism had solved the
political. The latter event has, in fact, supplied one of those themes dear
to novelists of the lesser kind: how a man wastes away once his lifelong
enemy dies.
Europe provided the main arena for the ideological battle. The western
victory was that of the European Community; but the battle absorbed so much
physical and intellectual energy that the victors were left wondering what
to do for their next trick. They came up with two devices. The single market
was already in the making and had to be completed. Then, Maastricht, and the
plan for a nicer kind of union ensured that navel-watching became the order
of the day. On a wider front, the western system no longer had to prove
itself; it had won.
That was before unemployment resumed its climb. But the great thing about
having 20m west Europeans unemployed today, as opposed to 60 years ago, is
that there is little likelihood of those responsible being challenged by
alternative views. Contrary to some over-heated reports, fascist
storm-troopers are not stomping through Bonn or Berlin. And the nearest
thing to a red mob is Liverpool FC Supporters' Club.
Choices do, however, remain. A theme of the Copenhagen meeting was what was
often portrayed as the unfair competition coming from South-East Asia and
even the US. Niels Helveg Petersen, the Danish foreign minister, spoke
disparagingly of US society - it was a regrettably unregulated model which
had led to the creation of a potentially criminal underclass. Asia provided
the 'uncaring' model. Europe had to maintain its specific role as the
supplier of free market welfare.
The trouble is that this system translates automatically into government
spending and extra costs. In Asia, welfare comes from self-provision, the
classic example being Singapore's Central Provident Fund - in effect, a
system of forced saving. The government exacts a levy on incomes to provide
direct investment in the national economy which, in turn, becomes a pension
fund.
So, if the premises are true, the oriental system leads to saving and
investment, the European to excess state spending and budget deficits.
Europe has made its choice, which would seem to be the civilised option.
And, as Oliver Wendell Holmes (or someone very like him) said: 'Taxes are
the price I pay for civilisation.' But it has produced a system that has to
'care' above and beyond the purposes for which it was designed originally.
The response, as we have seen most notably in France, is to spread a new
myth of the Yellow Peril. The Paris papers write of 'Asiatic Ants' who
threaten Europe's prosperity. While this is typical of the nonsense
emanating from that capital these days, it is hard to avoid the impression
that, in fact, Europe is coming to see itself as entering a new sort of
ideological war to replace the the old one.
Yet, even at the risk of making my own observations appear rather less
pertinent than I would like, we are probably the victims of Euro-morosite
and Euro-angst. After all, if all these ghastly things we talk about are
true now, they cannot suddenly have become true in the past three years.
Some time soon, I expect I shall be writing: 'Western Europe is entering the
21st century with a new-found confidence that would have seemed fanciful
only a couple of years ago. Gone are the pessimism and the talk of
Euro-uncompetitiveness bred by chronically rising joblessness . . .' Well,
you can write it yourself.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: To the right, smartly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY I attended the morning editorial conferences of The Daily
Telegraph, The Sun and Daily Mail - three staunch defenders of the British
way of life. I do this periodically, for it keeps me in touch with
right-wing opinion. I am always welcomed warmly.
The reason I am warmly welcomed is that I am related, by birth, to all the
great proprietors and to many of the editors of Britain's national
newspapers. I have a smart-card to prove it, a golden piece of plastic that
whisks me through the security cordons that all newspapers use to shield
themselves from readers.
As usual, the conference at the Telegraph resembled a full-dress planning
meeting for a spectacular act of war. There were maps on the walls and
stacks of computer print-out. On the editor's desk stood a life-like model
of a Trident nuclear submarine. When the editor walked in, everyone stood
and saluted him. He was wearing an air vice-marshall's cape and a
bombardier's plumed hat that was not of this century.
Gentlemen, he said. I liked this morning's paper. It had blood, sweat and
tears. It offered high-precision gunnery. Also excellent work by the
cavalry. But where was the wretched infantry? Our coverage of Michael Mates'
resignation was without doubt first-class. And the sports desk got its
finger out with some rousing stuff on the battling Brits at Wimbledon.
Peterborough shone. Arts was up to scratch. And I liked the tailpiece letter
from Ian Hamilton Fazey, about Mekons and dinosaurs.
But there were blemishes, gentlemen. The weather report offended me. Let me
quote from the start: 'General Situation: Patchy mist and fog in England and
Wales will soon clear to leave a dry day with fairly sunny skies. However,
it will become cloudier in the north later, but still bright.' It is
expressly stated in standing orders, gentlemen, that the word however is
never to appear anywhere except in editorials - least of all in the weather.
Second, there was no reference this morning to world war two. I have told
you repeatedly that the 50th anniversary of world war two is to be a daily
feature of our current circulation drive. Next year we will be celebrating
D-Day itself. Starting Monday, I want a blockbuster summer offensive to
establish the scene. For a month I shall edit the paper from an office in
Bayeux. That is all, gentlemen. Dis-miss.
Round at the Sun, I expected the editor to be furious at the way his staff
had squandered the best tabloid story of the week. It started: 'Giving up
sex can kill you, a boffin warned yesterday. Professor John Copeland claims
our bodies waste away when we stop having nookie. He said: 'Once
reproduction has stopped, maybe the body gets the message that its
usefulness has ceased'.' The story was crammed into just 9 centimetres.
Come to think of it, 9cm is probably par for the course for most Sun
readers. But the editor was indifferent. He looked broody and troubled.
Apparently (sources tell me) he has not been the same since the FT afforded
him space to propagate his peculiar brand of Euroscepticism. The experience
went to his head. Now he has gone all serious. Has ideas above his station.
There are a hundred and one things we should be doing, he screamed at his
minions yesterday. I want major Sun series on EC competition policy,
cross-border deals, the transparency of merger control, Bundesbank interest
rate policy, EC employment prospects, privatisation, banking and financial
deregulation, labour costs and productivity, and whether Russia's plan to
offload rare earths and metals has a strategic downside for companies in
Britain. We owe it to Sun readers to keep them abreast of serious news.
There is more to life than tits, you know.
At the Daily Mail the editor looked pleased with yesterday's issue, which
mixed good-to-middling columnists with Mail-type clamminess (Andre Agassi's
chest hair; Raine Spencer's diet).
In accordance with Mail tradition the editor conducts his morning
conferences while sitting on a throne, attended by flunkies and a sweet
choir of eunuchs. Yesterday, in front of him, prostrate and forlorn, lay a
broken, penitent figure whom I took to be John Major. But I could not
approach the throne. The crush was too oppressive. So I tiptoed away,
dumbstruck and awed.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Arts: Shock in Salisbury - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FASCINATION with contemporary American theatre continues to spread. One
would not normally expect the British premiere of a play about veterans from
Vietnam to take place in Wiltshire, but here it is.
At the Salisbury Playhouse, Sam Shepard's States of Shock is given one of
the best sets I have ever seen in a studio theatre. As the title suggests,
everything about the play is in varying degrees electric. The set includes
thin neon lighting, but also some lovely street lighting of the kind that is
just coming back into vogue. It looks old, but relies on modern technology.
The stage is littered with hundreds, possibly thousands of small
photographs, some of them torn up and on the floor, others stuck on the
walls. Before the piece opens an elderly white couple whom I first took to
be dummies are sitting at a table. They turn out to be real, with memories
of an American war long before Vietnam. That was the war between the states,
as southerners still call it. Shepard is very precise about his titles.
The play itself has a concealed shock. On the face of it, an American
colonel is looking after a mutilated returnee from Vietnam who is supposed
to have tried to save the colonel's son from being killed in an incident of
'friendly fire'.
The colonel appears to be trying to reconstruct what happened. It is a test
of your pyschological instinct how quickly you guess that the mutilated
victim is in fact the colonel's son. David Burke's colonel cannot bring
himself to accept that his boy did not either die or return as a hero.
There is another twist. The mutilated victim does not realise either until
late on that the colonel is his father. None of that is wholly explicit. Nor
is that all. Gradually the elderly couple come into the play, first mildly
complaining that their clam chowder in the American diner has not been
served while the men from Vietnam can get a banana split in five minutes,
then enjoying a return to an American past where rebellious youth is beaten
into shape.
American sentimentality comes in as well. The flag never leaves the stage
and the play ends with everyone quietly singing 'Good Night, Irene'.
Intellectually it may not add up, but it is an immensely powerful spectacle.
The production is part of the Royal National Theatre's Springboards Festival
under which the RNT is seeking to extend its studio techniques throughout
the country. The Salberg Studio at the Salisbury Playhouse is an able and
willing pupil. Lucy Hall's set deserves the highest praise and Deborah
Paige, the artistic director at Salisbury, here shows an immaculate command
of detail. Nearly everyone to do with the performance, including very much
David Burke, has had some experience of the RNT or the RSC.
There is one reservation. I admire Sam Shepard's style, but there is just a
possibility that he is becoming a bit of a cult outside his own country. I
doubt if he has much to teach British playwrights. States of Shock is
technically brilliant, but it lasts barely an hour.
Salberg Studio, Salisbury Playhouse until July 3. (0722) 320 333

FT  26 JUN 93 / Arts: The Vixen prowls again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AWAY FROM arias, starring roles, magnificent sets, epic stories, Janacek's
The Cunning Little Vixen is one of the jewels of opera. Only a composer
coming from outside the standard operatic tradition could have lighted upon
a cartoon story of a young fox and told it in music of such radiant beauty
as to make his work one of the great human operas of all time.
The piece has none of the ingredients for an international company. (How
could one possibly cast roles such as the Caterpillar, Mosquito and Chief
Hen with jet-setting stars?) So it was a surprise when the Royal Opera put
on its first ever production of this opera in 1990, and sung in English,
what is more. This week it has returned for its first revival, opening
during the Covent Garden Proms week alongside more standard fare.
Bill Bryden's production has been widely praised. It is abstract rather than
literal, imaginative, poetic, humorous, all the things one wants a
production of this delightful opera to be, except that its ingenuity
sometimes gets the better of it. Janacek's aim is to show us how the natural
world outlives us all, how it is unchangeable, ever-renewing. But this
staging represents nature by a machine, in the form of large concentric
circles turning like cog-wheels in a clock, which is difficult to reconcile
with the opera's fundamentally green message.
Perhaps the intention was to tell us that nature is timeless. If so, the
visual metaphor makes the wrong connections. Best to set that aside and
enjoy instead the way the production communicates a wide-eyed delight at the
natural world and a high musical standard.
In the duet between the Vixen and the Fox Janacek explores more touchingly
than in any of his human operas the first faltering steps of young love. 'Do
you smoke?', he asks her. 'No', she replies, with the defensive
afterthought, 'not yet]' Lillian Watson is marvellous again as the Vixen, as
spritely and youthful in movement as she is in voice, and she is partnered
with a caring, confident, but never pushy Fox from Rita Cullis.
Anthony Michaels-Moore sings well as the Forester, who is younger than
usual. He seems a resourceful man, who would not be caught out by the
playful antics of his young vixen; a degree of mature wisdom, of worldly
depth is missing. Donald Adams as the Badger stood out among the animals,
Robin Leggate's Schoolmaster and Roderick Earle's Poacher among the humans,
because they managed to get more of the words across - a constant problem
throughout the evening.
It may be that Bernard Haitink will be able to balance words and music more
effectively as the performances continue. The orchestral playing is already
above average and Haitink has the gift for making this music release its
immense human sympathy without lapsing into sentimentality. Ideally the
opera does belong in a smaller theatre, where its scale would fit. But I
would not for one moment wish to deprive the Royal Opera's audience of the
opportunity to discover one of 20th-century opera's minor masterpieces.
(There are further performances until July 10.)
In Arthur Jacobs' Garsington piece on Thursday the director of Ariadne auf
Naxos should have read Aidan Lang

The Butcher of Baghdad by John Spurling at the Grace Theatre (Latchmere) is
a series of stories beautifully angled at President Saddam Hussein. It
amounts to a combination of 1001 Nights and the last hours of the Gulf War
in February 1991. This is no play for revisiting, but it makes thoughtful
arresting theatre.
The scene opens with a cleaver swinging like a pendulum. We are in Saddam's
command bunker, waiting for reports from the front. The play never names
Saddam, but refers to him as President or by titles like 'Commander of the
Faithful, Vice-Regent of Allah.' The President's mistress, Shahrazad,
beguiles the hours with tales of the Caliph and his poet-buffoon Ishak.
A skein of stories unwinds, beginning with a tangle over a lamb cutlet in
'The Poet and The Butcher' and continuing with short homilies on power and
fate in 'The Story of the Indispensable Wasir' and 'The Story of the Death
of Abdullah The Food Taster.' Each illustrates the implacable face of Islam
where the Caliph's whim is law, his power infinite and his decrees absolute.
Each calls up memories of the September 1980 offensive against Iran, and of
how insignificant the 400,000 losses then and the 100,000 losses now seemed
to be in the eye of Allah. And each recognises the demographic diversity of
a country not much bigger than Sweden filled with Shiite Moslems, Sunni
Arabs, Kurds and Christians living uneasily together.
The contemporary scenes are researched, and Spurling makes a blustering
encounter as the President hears of the Scud missile which hit the Daharan
air base in Saudi Arabia, killing 28 Americans. Eventually, the President
broadcasts his satisfaction with his army's great victory, and settles on a
ceasefire. Shahrazad has poisoned herself in attempting to kill him, and as
she dies, it means nothing more than a speck of sand on the beach.
The acting, particularly from the opal-voiced Mary Keegan and the gravelly
David Acton as Shahrazad and the President, makes the most of the small
stage. Director Andrew Visnevski and designer Katrina Lindsay manage the
movement and lighting to keep the action flowing and lucid.
Grace Theatre at the Latchmere (071 228 2620) until July 10

FT  26 JUN 93 / Arts: On the Vera Lynn wagon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE COMES a time in the life of moderately successful actors when they
look for a regular annuity to tide them over the quiet periods. Creating a
turn built around a character from the past - or present, fact - or fiction,
who is of sufficient popular interest to be manipulated into a one man, or
one woman, show is the perfect insurance policy.
Maggie Ollerenshaw is a familiar TV face, a solid supporting actor in shows
like Open All Hours and First of the Summer Wine. She has alighted on Vera
Lynn, the Forces Sweetheart, as her vehicle, prompted as much by a passing
physical resemblance to the star as to the excitement of her career. It is a
show that goes down well in places like Westcliff-on-Sea where fans of Vera,
now 76, are likely to be gathered in fair numbers.
The very ordinariness of Vera Lynn's life gives it a certain fascination,
and makes her achievements more staggering. She was born Vera Welch in East
Ham, and by her early teens was earning 7s 6d for belting out three songs in
working men's clubs (one and six extra if she won an encore). She was a
factory girl for one day but found life on the road as the crooner with the
Ambrose band more congenial. Her big break came with the War, when her
sentimental songs touched the popular spot. The weekly audience of 16m for
her 1941 Sunday night radio show, beamed to the troops, has never been
bettered.
Ollerenshaw could have been more forthcoming about why the BBC was
constantly anxious to drop Lynn, and on the War Office's anxieties that the
sentimentality of her music might make the forces homesick and Bolshie. But
this is no social document, more a browse through a familiar scrapbook. She
delivers the data on Lynn's public, and placid, life (she has stayed happily
married for over 50 years) straight and unadorned. Ollerenshaw starts
nervously, but by the second half, when she tackles Lynn's great adventure,
entertaining the Forgotten Army near the front line in Burma, she has
acquired some of the bravura of her subject.
A slight surprise is that Ollerenshaw is no singer. Her voice is tremulous
and unimpressive compared with Lynn's melodious foghorn. By the end,
stomping around the stage in khaki, she was lively enough to cheer up all
the old dears in the audience who thought they had come to see the real
Vera, and who were desperately keen to join in the choruses.
The Palace Westcliff has not made a major contribution to British theatrical
history, apart from giving local boy Ray Cooney first runs for his farces,
but it earns 74 per cent of its revenue, which suggests it has the local
audience taped. It is bullied rather by Eastern Arts, which would like it to
be a receiving house for artsy touring groups rather than the regular
creator of its own productions, and its subsidy has been halved to Pounds
45,000. But in its unostentatious way the Palace keeps the flag of both
drama and light entertainment flying in difficult territory.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Arts: Happily sprawled in the Garden - Alastair Macaulay
recalls 21 years of Promming at the Royal Opera House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWENTY-ONE years ago this year, the Royal Opera and the Midland Bank
launched the Covent Garden Proms. Critics have always praised this venture,
in which the Stalls' usual 546 seats are removed for a week to make room for
700 Prommers - who sit, squat, sprawl or lie on the red carpet. These
Prommers have always been more attentive and more enthusiastic than those
they replace (some of whom now pay Pounds 98 per seat). But, as the late
Harold Rosenthal, then editor of Opera, wrote in 1974, if just one Prommer
becomes a regular Covent Garden patron, the Proms will have been worthwhile.
It so happens that the first Prommers, in September 1972, included Richard
Fairman, (who reviews the Vixen, above),then a schoolboy who had recently
finished his A-levels. And, in April 1974, I - then a first-year
undergraduate - attended all six Proms performances. These included the
first ballet Proms, which were my first taste of great choreography and
great dancing.
This week I decided to go promming again. There have always been a few keen
queuers who begin around 11 am; but, as in previous years, I found that less
than 100 were in front of me when I joined the queue just before 4pm. The
box-office and auditorium open, as of old, an hour before performance.
As in previous years, my queue neighbours were widely varied. One of them,
who had arrived here four weeks previously from Australia, knew plenty about
current opera and was working here as a waiter; one had first attended the
Royal Opera House in 1946, when, as a balletomane Wren, she had been given a
place in the Royal Box to watch Margot Fonteyn, Robert Helpmann and Beryl
Grey in The Sleeping Beauty; and one of them, an American, was catching up
with European culture after 20 years in Kenya.
In 1974, as I recall, a Proms place cost Pounds 1. Today one costs Pounds
10. Still, for last Monday's Tosca, the carpet felt as full as it did in
1974 for a Cotrubas-Carreras Traviata. Partly because the Proms now occur in
term-time, no doubt, fewer of today's Prommers are students. Partly because
of today's economy, no doubt, more of them wear City suits or pearls. Mine
was by no means the only FT in the queue.
Recalling the Proms of the 1970s, I feel that they helped to change my life.
There must have been others over the years who now feel the same way. On
their behalf and mine, to the Midland Bank and the Royal Opera House, a big
thankyou.
The current season of Covent Garden Proms ends tonight, with another Tosca

FT  26 JUN 93 / Arts: Intelligent attention - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS YEAR'S Reith Lectures are given by Professor Edward Said, born in
Israel, now Professor at Columbia University. His subject is 'Intellectuals
and their role', and if many intelligent people argue that they have no
role, this should at least ensure plenty of intelligent attention. The first
lecture (Radio 4, Wednesday, repeated Radio 3, Friday) was called
Representations of the Intellectual, but it went beyond that; he even used
the phrase 'the Intellectual vocation'. His chosen representations were
fictional - Bazarov in Turgenev's Fathers and Sons, Stephen Dedalus in
Joyce's Portrait of the Artist and Moreau in Flaubert's L'Education
sentimentale; pretty different characters, but all determined not to be
involved in matters where decisions had been made by others. There must be
some good intellectual points to be made in the five lectures to come.
Radio 4's Monday Play was David Edgar's The Shape of the Table, repeated
from the World Service. A dissident writer, Pavel Prus, opens with an
account of his descent from writing fairy-tales to imprisonment, but he is
soon involved in the political discussions of the new order, an unviolent
revolution having taken place. The old guard are out, and a newly
reactionary party is busy sorting out the best jobs. This kind of state
scheming is the very thing Edgar likes; there is something intellectual,
indeed, about his concern. I was not totally entranced by the talk, which
dealt with imaginary party-lines one was not familiar with; but there were
telling exchanges - 'You made your deal', 'We had our conversation'. The
political climate becomes more and more bourgeois, and I need hardly say
that Prus ends up as President. He was played by Karl Johnson, and the
direction was by Hilary Norrish.
Wednesday on Radio 4 is baby night, and unexpectedly horrifying. This week,
Baby Farming; last week, midwives; the week before, Rescuing the Inner
Child, about the after-effects of child-abuse. Wednesday's piece, presented
by Stanley Williamson, was documentary, and the horrors it recalled are
unlikely to be equalled today. Between 1866 and 1869, of 298 inquests the
Central Middlesex coroner sat on, 174 were of murdered babies - not mainly
of poor families but of middle and upper classes too. Awkward children went
to 'minders' for a shilling or so a week. A public-spirited doctor, Alfred
Wiltshire, made enquiries; one minder was found by the police with five
babies a few weeks old and five aged between 14 months and 2 1/2 years; she
was subsequently hanged. Not until 1872 was any government action taken.
The Inner Child programme, presented by Jane Grayshon, was about the
after-effects of child abuse. Childish reactions are retained in adults and
can cause social trouble. The cure advised by counsellors is to treat this
'inner child' from an adult point of view, perhaps even write letters. Some
of the experiences recalled were unpleasant, but at least there is official
retribution available nowadays.
There are many silhouettes of the star players of old times on Radio 2, and
if I do not refer to them here it is because they don't tell me anything
new. We had Grace Moore on Tuesday - a song from the New Moon film,
recordings from the Met in New York (where she failed her first audition),
the Music Box Revue. We heard her singing, but not talking; the truth is we
learnt nothing. These 'spotlights' are fun to hear, but they only amount to
illustrated editions of Who's Who.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Arts: Jessye Norman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN RECENT years Jessye Norman has elected to tackle some of opera's most
'extreme' heroines - Bartok's Judith and the unnamed protagonist of
Schoenberg's monodrama Erwartung, Isolde and Salome. The majority of these
have already been sampled, in some form or another, in London; little that
she has done here has been quite as impressive as her concert account of
Erwartung at the Barbican Hall on Thursday, in company with Pierre Boulez
and the London Symphony Orchestra.
On the face of it there might be thought a certain lack of 'match' between
the soprano and at least some of these ladies. Certainly, the Schoenberg
monodrama - a miraculously fine-woven, subtly-coloured musical marriage of
nightmare, Freudian psychological analysis and prose-poem, in which a woman
searches in a wood for a lost lover whose body she suddenly discovers -
would seem to require an altogether different kind of artistic profile.
The stream-of-consciousness narration calls for spontaneous utterance, wide
emotional range, nimble alternation of moods from quiet reflection to
furious torment. The mature Norman style is monumental - the stance and
demeanour totemic, the bronze streams of tone grandly poured out, then
channelled by minute calculation in the shaping and shading of every word.
Mercurial responsiveness finds no place in the delivery.
And yet, because all the singer's considerable intelligence had been
concentrated on the task, the experience developed a mesmeric power all its
own. The presence on the podium of Boulez was, in the best sense, a
counterweight to monumentality: his handling of those intricate
Schoenbergian thought-patterns was itself a miracle of balance - of nervous
energy sustained, dramatic impulse disciplined, musical imagery lucidly
traced.
The old view of Erwartung as one long overwrought Expressionist torrent
seemed light-years distant.
concert sponsored by the Sema Group; repeated at the Barbican Hall tonight

FT  26 JUN 93 / Arts: Russian flavour to Spitalfields / Review of Walton and
Shostakovich at the Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON Wednesday at the Spitalfields Festival, Richard Hickox and the Northern
Sinfonia played Shostakovich and Walton, and (despite support from the
Walton Trust) Shostakovich won. The Bear, Walton's hearty one-act opera
after Chekhov's rather subtler piece, was not ideally placed after
Shostakovich's 14th Symphony, which is desperately serious and scathing.
In fact the opera was excellently cast, with Della Jones singing a
larger-than-life Popova, the volatile widow with airs, and a gruff,
explosive Smirnov - who comes to collect a debt and ends by collecting
Popova instead - from Alan Opie. Both of them flung themselves into the
comedy with fervour bordering on frenzy. Yet we didn't laugh much. The
singers' diction was beyond reproach, but Walton's racketty little orchestra
(a small battalion of percussion, raucous muted brass) loomed just behind
them, and in the resonant Christ Church acoustic the instruments were
impossible to keep decently down.
Miss Jones and Opie soon found themselves belting out most of their music,
just to make it heard amid the roar. One wanted more half-lights, slyer
character - which they could certainly provide in a more singer-friendly
setting, and indeed in a staging: physical confrontation is essential to
this comedy, and face-pulling while they sang straight from the score made a
thin substitute. Adjusted to a proper theatre, this performance ought to be
delightful. It enjoyed the bonus of a very superior manservant, since the
bass Stephen Richardson was on hand for the Shostakovich anyway.
There he was greatly impressive, as was Miss Jones (and their Russian, too -
gutturally persuasive to an inexpert ear like mine, and used to biting
effect). The 'symphony' is a 1969 song-cycle on poems translated from Lorca,
Apollinaire and Rilke, and one by Wilhelm Kuchelbecker, all concerned with
death, persecution, lofty anger and grim despair. The vocal lines are etched
into an extraordinary small-orchestra score, bleakly spare strings frosted
with touches of celesta, vibes, xylophone, bells: an unforgettable
sub-Arctic sound world.
Hickox conducted it with cool, exact sympathy, and drew admirably sensitive
playing from the Northern Sinfonia. No risk here of overwhelming the
singers, who were left free to penetrate the songs in depth. Despite the
presiding tone of this disillusioned music, the range of bitter expression
is wide and varied, and both artists were in formidable command of it. After
the insights of their performance, I thought I might at last begin to
understand Shostakovich's hitherto opaque 15th Symphony.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Arts: Blooms with multiple meanings - Patricia Morison
revels in 'Pick of the Bunch' from the Fitzwilliam Museum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROSES ARE at their peak, lavender has purpled, and the scent of philadelphus
is enough to make any gardener lose his or her head. In a June such as this,
to give flower lovers any more pleasure could be risky. Even so, it would be
a pity to deny yourself Pick of the Bunch, an exhibition of Dutch, Flemish,
and French flower paintings from the 17th to early 19th centuries. It is at
John Mitchell Son, 160, New Bond Street, London W1 (071-493-7567) and closes
July 15.
The 'bunch' is the magnificent collection of flower-paintings, the largest
in the world, owned by the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. Pick of the
Bunch is a chance to display some 50 flower paintings and also flower
miniatures, many made as lids for snuff-boxes etc.
The Fitzwilliam owes its wealth of flower paintings to a Norfolk gentleman
with a passion for flowers. In the 1930s, Major Henry Broughton, later 2nd
Lord Fairhaven, created a legendary water-garden beside the Broads. He also
began to collect, starting in the 1930s with bird paintings and then
switching to flowers. Broughton's gift of 37 paintings transformed the
Fitzwilliam's own small but rather fine collection of flower pictures. On
his death in 1973, the museum received a further 83 oil paintings, no less
than 1500 flower drawings, and a quantity of miniatures.
With such a huge collection, a fair number of the paintings in Pick of the
Bunch are being seen in public for the first time in decades. It includes
many of the great names in the development of flower painting, beginning
with Breughel. 'Flowers in a Clay Vase' by Jan 'Velvet' Breughel is
described by Peter Mitchell, who selected the exhibition, as the most
important flower painting in Britain. It is a lovely thing, dozens of blooms
massed tightly together and yet depicted with such lightness of touch that
the bouquet seems to tremble with life.
As ever, Brueghel's is not a naturalistic bouquet; primroses, poppies, and
roses never normally nod to one other. However, in the infancy of flower
painting, artists were licensed to turn the seasons upside down in order to
record prized specimens for their patrons. Another unnaturalness is
Breughel's iris, a fabulous bloom of blue-white stippled with black, twice
the size of anything else in the arrangement. Did its owner love it more
than anything else in his garden? Diamond and pearl jewels lie at the foot
of the vase. Perhaps the message of the painting was that flowers like the
iris were no less valuable than the goldsmith's creation.
Multiple meanings lie hidden in paintings by such well-known names as Willem
van Aelst, Daniel Seghers, Jean Michel Picart, and Jean-Baptiste Monnoyer.
In a typically dark and eerie painting by Otto Marseus van Shriek, a bouquet
of roses, carnations, and alchemillas has attracted not just a cloud of
butterflies but also a lizard and a snake.
Bugs and beetles nibble away at many bouquets, a traditional reference to
the gnawing tooth of time but also testimony to 17th-century humanists'
delight in the bewildering variety of God's creation. They coexist most
beautifully in a masterpiece by Jan de Heem, a Dutchman of the generation
after Breughel who settled in Antwerp.
This painting, the largest in the exhibition, is a splendid rediscovery.
Years ago, the De Heem used to hang in the public galleries until the day
when it was pronounced to be merely 'school of' De Heem. Down the painting
went to the reserves, to be rediscovered only when the exhibition was being
selected. It has been newly cleaned by the Hamilton Kerr Institute, and
found to be in exceptionally good condition.
Anyone who thinks flower paintings are dull should study this De Heem. For
one thing, it has an exceptionally energetic quality which comes partly from
the eye-catching diagonal tulips and from the twisting flower-heads and
ragged, curling leaves. Every passage is a miracle of technical skill. A
greenhopper, straddling the stone ledge and a blackberry leaf, contrasts
with the velvet butterfly. A poppy-leaf, tinged with pink, has just the
right touch of flabbiness and sprinkled with perfect raindrops.
If I were able to take any of these pictures home, it might be Adriaen
Coorte's bundle of asparagus, given to the Fitzwilliam by the painter, Sir
Frank Brangwyn. Sisterly feelings might tempt me to ask for either painting
by two women flower painters much admired in their own time and now Vallayer
Coster and Rachel Ruysch. There is a third woman, the almost unknown
19th-century painter, Melanie de Chomolera, on this showing a faithful
rehasher of the 18th-century manner.
But the painting I covet above all is by Boilly (1761-1845), whose still
lives are exceedingly rare. This painting is all softness and not a little
sensuality, too, and yet with a tinge of Romantic gloom. The light is
concentrated on a superb group of roses, in bud and full bloom, their full,
white petals enfolding a deep pink vortex. A dead sparrow lies on the ledge,
its soft grey feathers finding an echo in the funebral shade of the lilac
and purple-red poppy.
                             *      *      *
Early flower-painters - Cornelis de Heem and Bosschaert the Elder - also
hang in the exhibition of Dutch and Flemish Old Masters at Noortman, 40, Old
Bond Street (until July 16). It includes still lives by De Heems, father and
son, two Hobbema landscapes, and 'A Flirtation' by Wouverman which formerly
belonged to Earl Mountbatten.
The two most remarkable paintings are Pieter De Hooch's 'Courtyard of a
House in Delft' and Gerard Dou's 'A Painter in his Studio', a fascinating
contrast with the painting which was its source, the young Rembrandt's
famous painting, exhibited in the recent National Gallery exhibition. A grey
parasol which hangs on the studio wall was not used to shade the artist
(Rembrandt himself, it has been claimed) from Leiden's summer heat, but to
keep off the dust as his pictures dried.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Arts: Impressionists are back in fashion - Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS an air of tangible relief, approaching exhilaration, in the London
auction rooms of Sotheby's and Christie's this week. The major summer sales
of Impressionist, Modern and contemporary art, the backbone of the turnover
 -and the profit - of both companies, had gone better than anyone dared
hope. Barring some unforeseen mishap, the recession is over at the highest
echelons of the art market.
For almost three years now the auctioneers have stood at the rostrum,
talking to themselves, while a stony-faced audience has watched impassively
as good Impressionist painting has followed indifferent modern sculpture
back to a disappointed vendor.
But at Christie's on Monday night James Roundell experienced the
breakthrough. 'Suddenly there were four raised hands in the room, all
bidding for the same lot. They weren't prepared to chase each other up to
ridiculous levels but there was definite interest again'. By the end of the
evening Christie's had assembled Pounds 17.9m from 48 lots, with the 18 per
cent unsold percentage by value its lowest in this sector for three years.
The top lot says it all. A Renoir portrait of a young girl holding flowers,
more subdued than many similar Renoir paintings, was estimated to make
around Pounds 4.5m. It sold for Pounds 5.7m. In 1987, when the Impressionist
market was moving towards its peak, the same work had sold for Dollars 4.8m.
The message was repeated 24 hours later at Sotheby's, which recorded its
highest total for a London Impressionist sale in almost three years of
Pounds 20.3m with 14 per cent unsold. The improvement could be neatly
charted. The first portents were visible in New York last December when a
Matisse sold for Dollars 14.5m and a Monet for Dollars 12.1m. They had
become tangible by May with Sotheby's amazing itself, and the dealers, by
disposing of a Cezanne for Dollars 28.6m, way above forecast. London did not
offer such impressive pictures, but it seemed as if the past month had added
to confidence, with broader based bidding and more lots finding buyers.
This week's prices still seem modest compared with the midsummer madness of
New York in 1990 when, in three days, a Japanese industrialist, Ryoei Saito,
paid Dollars 82.5m for a Van Gogh portrait at Christie's and Dollars 78.1m
for a Renoir music hall scene at Sotheby's, but they are a significant
improvement on the meagre Pounds 6.6m sale total raised by Sotheby's and the
Pounds 10.3m by Christie's in December 1990 when the art market suddenly
took the full force of the recession and the loss of nerve by buyers.
This week Sotheby's and Christie's were confident that within the next year
they will be able to bring out the champagne again. For although it is
death, divorce and debt that mainly bring works of art on to the market,
somehow these three seem capable of holding off when demand is non-existent
and prices have nose-dived. Only rising values trigger the return of the
masterpieces. 'Sellers can now feel more confident that if they have good
paintings, with reasonable estimates, there is no reason why they should not
go' says Melanie Clore, director of Sotheby's Impressionist department, who
carefully packaged an auction of pictures fresh on the market and carrying
attractively low estimates.
It is the important works of art which bring out the big buyers, the world's
richest connoisseur collectors, like Niarchos, Thyssen, Newhouse, Barbara
Johnson and Anneberg, whose fortunes have hardly suffered during the
recession. When one did become available in May, Van Gogh's 'Wheat field
with cypresses', Annenberg stepped in smartly to buy it privately, only to
present it to the Metropolitan Museum of art in New York. The enthusiasm of
the ultra rich for buying art again somehow permeates down to the very
lowest reaches of the market.
Bidding at the week's auctions was an encouraging mix of dealers and private
collectors, Europeans and Americans. Even the Japanese were back, but the
serious Japanese dealers, not the speculative punters who were largely
responsible for pushing the price of indifferent Renoirs, Monets and
Picassos to unsustainable heights in 1989 and early 1990. Fortunately the
hundreds of Impressionist and modern works of art in Japan stay locked away
in the bank vaults ., often acting as collateral to loans. The owners seem
content to wait for them to slowly regain their value.
The success of the week has shattered one rapidly growing lobby, which
argued that the prices reached in the summer of 1990 would not be repeated
for a generation, and that Old Master pictures had regained their hold over
the art market from the Impressionists. For not only were the best 20th
century works selling: even the follow up, second division sales, where new
collectors enter the fray by spending Pounds 100,000 or less on a work by
one of the Henri's - Lebasque, Martin and Cross - did quite well. Of course
demand is still selective and most works sell nearer the bottom of their
estimate than the top, but a market has re-established itself, and late 19th
and 20th century art remains the desirable collecting field for the rich.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Arts: Montreal goes for visual dramas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TANITCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONTREAL'S arts scene is well-known for its vitality, innovation and
willingness to take risks. The major talking- point of the fifth Festival de
Theatre des Ameriques was a cycle of three Shakespeare plays, Coriolanus,
Macbeth and The Tempest, translated and adapted by the Quebecois playwright
Michel Garneau and directed by Robert Lepage.
The present cycle, which has already been seen in France and which will be
seen again in Europe later this year, will appeal to audiences who think
visual images are more important than the actual text. Coriolanus is set
within a rectangular frame measuring 4 feet by 16 feet. It is like watching
a very small cinemascope screen. The frame cuts off the actors' legs; when
they stand on tables (which they do quite often) the frame cuts off their
heads and they look like ruined figures in a Roman frieze.
Shakespeare's tragedy is played for comedy. The action takes place in bars,
restaurants and broadcasting studios. Coriolanus and Aufidius wrestle on the
ground in the nude in slow motion; but, with the aid of a slanting mirror,
it seems as if their sexual foreplay is taking place in mid-air. The battle
scenes are played by puppets. The action is punctuated by the modern alarums
of a city caught in a traffic jam.
Jules Philip's Coriolanus is so young he might still be in the sixth form;
it is difficult to imagine him either as a triumphant general or as somebody
to whom the Roman people would offer a consulship. The most memorable
performance is by Anne-Marie Cadieux, who plays Volumnia, that most
formidable of Roman matrons, in a high camp manner.
Coriolanus has been translated into modern Quebecois. Macbeth has been put
into an archaic and barbaric language, drawn from an abridged dictionary
listing words prohibited by the clergy and sprinkled with Norman and Breton
dialects. The setting is a wooden passageway on two levels, running the
whole width of the stage and made out of rough planks which can be pulled
down to form a fence. At one point Macbeth is seen through the slats,
running backwards and forwards, giving, with the help of strobe lighting, a
magic lantern effect.
The Tempest, translated into classical Quebecois, is set in a rehearsal room
with a wall of mirrors, a ballet barre and some gym lockers. In the centre
are two green- topped tables round which the actors sit. The production
begins with Prospero (Jacques-Henri Gagnon) in jeans, in his role of theatre
director, reading his opening scene with Miranda.
Caliban is played by Anne-Marie Cadieux as a manic female punk-rocker with
coarse voice, blackened eyes, hobnail boots and wearing a plastic garbage
bag. Marie Brassard's Ariel spends most of her time on top of the
light-fitting, which she uses as a trapeze. Caliban, Trinculo and Stephano
act their drunken scene on top of the lockers.
The Shakespeare cycle played to packed and enthusiastic houses. So did
Gertrude Stein's existential oddity, Doctor Faustus Lights The Lights,
written in 1938 but not performed until after her death in 1946. Faustus
sells his soul to discover electricity. There were three different
Faustuses; three Marguerites in identical blue dresses; two Mephistos (one a
red-headed clown); a towering transvestite with a sickle; three dwarves in
yellow macintoshes and a dog who said 'thank you'. The action, a religious
and psychological conflict, took place in Faustus's mind. The music by Hans
Peter Kuhn was minimal.
The production was by American director Robert Wilson, who has spent most of
his working life in Europe. Wilson (like Lepage) is more interested in form,
movement and light than he is in text. He feels most actors are too
text-orientated and argues that the best actors are those who do not
understand what they are saying. Hence his decision to direct a group of
East Berlin drama students in English. The text was used for its sound
rather than its meaning and the flat German intonation gave the banality an
extra dimension. I felt I was watching a ballet. The performance was cold
and mechanical and, at an hour-and-a-half, mercifully short for a director
whose productions are liable to last five, 12, 24 hours, even three days.
Pol Pelletier, founder of the Women Experimental Theatre in Montreal, threw
herself energetically into a two-and-a-half hour monologue, Joie, which
described her career in the theatre in particular and the lot of women in
general. This cri de coeur was much enjoyed by an audience able to follow
the references to Montreal's political life during the last two decades.
I also saw The Lorca Play, written and directed by Daniel Brooks and Daniel
MacIvor, which used extracts from The House of Bernarda Alba and snippets of
information about Lorca. The piece was acted by seven actresses, who marched
up and down, and one limping male narrator, who stamped his cane. The
performance was an unsatisfactory mixture of meticulously rehearsed choral
work and messy improvisation.
Coriolanus is coming to Nottingham Playhouse at the end of November

VINDICATION by Frances Sherwood Phoenix House Pounds 14.99, 435 pages
HOTEL PASTIS by Peter Mayle Hamish Hamilton Pounds 15.99, 313 pages
THESE TWO novels share three features: they are both first novels  - one
written by a seasoned writer, the other by a relative novice; neither is
good; and both are not good in a remarkable way.
Braving the hazards inherent in fictionalising real life characters, Frances
Sherwood based her novel on the life and times of Mary Wollstonecraft. A
strong-headed woman of humble social background, Mary Wollstonecraft
developed into a formidable champion of women's rights. She experienced
London at the end of the 18th century, witnessed at first hand the
destructive convolutions of the French Revolution, had lovers  - including
the writer William Godwin, whom she eventually married  - and friends among
the leading literati of her time, and herself left a considerable literary
legacy which, for her time, was audaciously provocative.
Her story offers many traps to the fiction-maker. Ms Sherwood manages to
fall into most of them. Her recreation of 18th century England and France is
freshly vivid. Her sense of place and time is evocative in the right way.
Where she fails is in breathing life into her characters, Mary
Wollstonecraft in particular, who comes across as rather doughy.
In an author's note Ms Sherwood admits that she had allowed 'many
deviations' from the actual historical life of her heroine and her
contemporaries. 'I wanted to popularise Mary, to make every woman in America
know about her,' she writes. 'The biographers have always been perplexed
about the discrepancy between Mary's personal life and what she wrote  -
emotion and chaos versus emancipated rhetoric. But I could understand this
perfectly from my own life.' The notion offers an interesting approach, but
this discrepancy is not demonstrated and Mary, in spite of Ms Sherwood's
contrived portraiture of unconventionality, remains conventionally dull.
The demerits of Hotel Pastis are the converse. The hero, Simon Shaw, a rich
successful advertising man in London is stung by an expensive divorce and
exposed to the creeping mid-life ennui that comes with too much money and
success.
As the going gets rough Simon decamps for Provence, choosing 'the most
relaxed of his three cars for the trip, the Congo-black Porsche
convertible'. As luck would have it, Congo-black Porsche breaks down in a
village near Gordes, where Simon meets beautiful Nicole, who persuades him
to convert a derelict gendarmerie into a luxury hotel. Simon quits his
advertising business and does just that.
While the hotel gets under way, along with romance between Simon and Nicole,
a group of small-time local crooks are planning a caper. A happy and
prosperous end is effected through the agency of an old-fashioned Texas
tycoon whose large amiable son, staying at the hotel, is kidnapped by the
gang.
The plot and characters are the stuff of an up-market comic book, if there
is such a thing. But the writing sustains a glib, cheerful zip even through
the many banal situations. The assured style admits no literary pretensions
 - a redeeming factor. Mr Mayle  - of A Year in Provence fame and fortune  -
carefully sticks to a well-defined aim. To borrow a phrase  - only slightly
modified  - from a Provencal character in the novel: 'il ne pete pas plus
haut que son cul'.

THE INFINITE PLAN by Isabel Allende HarperCollins Pounds 14.99, 382 pages
WHEN The House of the Spirits, Isabel Allende's first novel, appeared in
1985 there was the definite sense of a major talent unfurled: a new writer
with a knack for haunting imagery and a consummate gift for telling a good
story. It seemed to matter little then that the novel owed a good deal to
Gabriel Garcia Marquez, that its array of autobiographical fragments was
skillfully pasted into a frame of magic realism with the family saga of One
Hundred Years of Solitude as its archetype; the recipe was a compelling and
effective one, and manages to retain its potency still on re-reading.
Nothing, though, that Allende has written since has come close to generating
the power and vision of that first book. Of Love and Shadows, set in an
unnamed, but typically repressed South American country, turned out be a
mundane romantic thriller, flecked just occasionally with descriptive,
lyrical passages recalling the power of its predecessor but never its sharp
focus. Eva Luna and still more its codicil The Stories of Eva Luna cleaved
closer again to Marquezian models, but both failed to make their sweet-sour
mixture of violence and sentiment gel into a credible or even convincingly
incredible world.
Now comes The Infinite Plan, and Allende's limitations as a novelist seem
all to clear. The South American backdrop has been abandoned altogether; the
novelist's own peripatetic life history - which has taken her from Peru
where she was born through Chile and Venezuela - has brought her and her
fiction to California, where the realities are different and the magic
realities different again.
The scheme is another family saga; the ambition is undoubtedly epic. The
protagonist is Gregory Reeves, raised in the Hispanic quarter of Los Angeles
as the son of a travelling evangelist, who ranges the western states in a
dilapidated charabanc retailing his Infinite Plan of deliverance. The Reeves
caravanserai attracts the exotic, the eccentric and the arcane, and gives
Allende a perfect platform for some colourfully sketched vignettes and
satirical observations on modern West Coast life.
Yet the description and characterisation never raise themselves above the
level of cliche and stereotype; the plot creaks, the motifs are reinforced
with the subtlety of a steamhammer, and a novelistic struture that attempts
two narrative streams running in parallel blurs into incoherence. The final
message of The Infinite Plan - that life is great in the Great American
Dream if you can only stick with it and win your struggle against adversity
 -is sickeningly pat, and makes one despair that Allende can ever recapture
the elegance and beauty of her first work, or transplant it successfully to
a new environment.

VICTORIAN POETRY: POETRY, POLITICS AND POETICS by Isobel Armstrong Routledge
Pounds 35, 544 pages
MUCH OF Victorian poetry was until recently a desolate no-go area. Then
Antonia Byatt's Booker-prize-winning novel Possession jolted many of us into
an awareness of the fascinating psychological complexities lurking within
that poetry. Isobel Armstrong, Professor of English at Birkbeck College, has
put together a collection of essays that amount to a re-interpretation of
the poetic output of the whole period. Poems like The Lotos Eaters, Mariana,
The Lady of Shallott, Maud, Fra Lippo Lippi, Porphyria, Sohrab and Rustum,
Dover Beach, Casabianca ('The boy stood on the burning deck . . .') and many
others lying moribund in the collective memory return alarmingly to life
under Armstrong's masterly dissections.
The poems are - in Armstrong's eyes - capable of dual readings. This is
particularly true of many poems by Tennyson and Browning that dramatise the
plight of an individual. You can either read the poem from within the
consciousness of the person at its centre or you can step outside his or her
mind and consider the totality of the situation. But let the Professor
explain:
'. . . the poet often invites the simple reading by presenting a poem as
lyric expression as the perceiving subject speaks. Mariana's lament or Fra
Lippo Lippi's apologetics are expressions, indeed, composed in an expressive
form. But in a feat of recomposition and externalisation the poem turns its
expressive utterance around so that it becomes the opposite of itself, not
only the subject's utterance but the object of analysis and critique. It is,
as it were, reclassified as drama in the act of being literal lyric
expression.'
From this Armstrong arrives at her key-concept - the double-poem - as the
chief poetic construct of the Victorian period. The two readings of the poem
are two poles generating tension, stress, ambiguity. This disturbance
inherent in the poem encourages us to penetrate beneath the surface meaning.
On the surface The Lotos Eaters is a dreamy poem about drug-taking and
retreat from activity; but step back and what do we have? 'Its exploration
is nearer to Marx's understanding of the estranged labour which converts all
energy expended outside work into subhuman or animal experience than to an
account of the text as a simple desire for escape and exploitation of
resources'.
Poetry was used by the Victorians as means of disseminating doctrine both by
those on the right and the left. Keble used poetry to inculcate Christian
piety. The Chartists used poetry to publicise their protests. The occasional
'hatchet-job' we read today on a new book of poems is a mild affair compared
with the way the likes of John Wilson or Croker would pitch into a new
volume by poets such as Tennyson. Indeed it is hardly an exaggeration to say
that poetry in Victorian times had the same urgency that today we devote to
considerations of the economy.
Professor Armstrong has reconstructed the main lines of this Victorian
debate about poetry as it occurred in reviews and articles. She identifies
the groups of theorists and critics from whom the poets drew strength. For
Tennyson, it was initially Hallam and the Apostles adumbrating a new kind of
post-Romantic conservative-subversive poetry of sensation. For Browning and
his discovery of the dramatic monologue she points to a link with Benthamite
Utilitarian theory and the notion of the Grotesque as expounded by Ruskin in
The Stones of Venice.
Some of these connections are dazzling. The most controversial is likely to
be her bracketing of Swinburne and Gerard Manley Hopkins as the two sides of
the same poetic coin, the sado-masochism of the former a counterpart of the
Jesuitical discipline of the latter. Armstrong's expositions are are not
always easy to comprehend, as in her long analysis of Christina Rossetti's
Goblin Market, the most haunting poem of the period, which she denies is
about anything as simple as menstruation or masturbation.
Armstrong devotes a substantial chapter to the women poets of the period in
which, as well as familiar names like Rossetti, Elizabeth Barrett Browning,
the Brontes, she resuscitates interest in such forgotten figures as Letitia
Landon, Felicia Hemans, Mathilde Blind, Amy Levy. Armstrong is a formidable
apologist who can turn versified dross into poetic gold - as she does with
Hardy's The Dynasts, in her view the last great Victorian double-poem.
This is one of those works of scholarship and interpretation that, like C S
Lewis's The Allegory of Love or William Empson's Seven Types of Ambiguity,
from now on students of English literature will need to turn to again and
again.

THE NIGHT MANAGER by John le Carre Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 15.99, 443
pages
THE masterpiece of John le Carre, as we can now see, was what his publishers
today call The Quest For Karla trilogy - the sequence of three long novels,
Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, The Honourable Schoolboy and Smiley's People -
in which the British intelligence chief Smiley confronts and eventually
outmanoeuvres his opposite number, his 'shadow', his semblable, his frere,
the Soviet spymaster Karla. At the end, at the moment of Smiley's victory,
they meet, unspeaking, at the Berlin Wall in a moment of profound truth:
'This thing of darkness I acknowledge mine,' as Prospero puts it in The
Tempest.
Le Carre was our finest novelist of the Cold War. His new novel triumphantly
breaks free of that genre and discovers a new world, a new subject - and he
has not lost his gift for the topical. The Night Manager is about British
arms exports to the Third World, Whitehall's complicity in that trade, a
giant scam by an English tycoon to swap arms for Latin American drugs with
the co-operation of 'a caucus of bent bankers, brokers and middlemen and
corrupt intelligence officers on both sides of the Atlantic.'
As so often in Le Carre's world, the protagonist - the hero - is an
innocent: a brave and lonely individual in danger of a tragic end, who is
inspired by his own decency and the love of a not-particularly-good woman to
fight against colleagues and employers, fellow spies and his own political
and civil service masters.
Jonathan Pine, the night manager, has retreated from army service in Ireland
to the safety of the posh hotel trade. He is rescued by a love affair in
Egypt with a woman he loved, betrayed, killed, and through whom he discovers
Roper, the businessman who is 'the worst man in the world'.
Roper is a great charmer who takes a robust and historical view of arms
dealing: he is happy to compare himself with Britain's 19th-century China
traders - 'Opium for tea. Barter. Came home to England, captains of
industry. Knighthood, honours, whole shebang. Hell's the difference? Go for
it] - that's all that matters. Americans know that. Why don't we?
Tight-arsed vicars braying from the pulpit every Sunday, old nellies'
tea-parties, seedcake, poor Mrs So-and-So died of the whatnots? Screw it.
Worse than bloody prison . . .' (It will be seen that Le Carre's
extraordinary gift for mimicry has never been so fully indulged and
developed. His dialogue is a never-ending delight.)
The night manager is recruited by a minor branch of British intelligence to
penetrate Roper's organisation. His deep cover is meticulously and
successfully developed to the point where he is trusted by Roper as front
man for his big arms deal with the Columbian drugs cartel. He falls in love
with Roper's woman. He is betrayed by his own side, caught up in the
Whitehall-Washington power struggle between 'Pure Intelligence' and
'Enforcement'. Le Carre's moral has not changed: 'The enemy's not out there.
He's here among us . . . We are honourable people, he thought . . .
Honourable people with self-irony and a sense of decency, people with a
street spirit, and a good heart. What the hell's gone wrong with us?'
This is wonderful stuff, subtle, exciting, complicated (almost too much so,
it is very complicated), vivid in its successive pictures of Switzerland,
Canada, the Caribbean, Central America - and of course, SW1. Who else could
introduce a sub-section like this?: 'Eight men and Goodhew sat at the long
refectory table: a Foreign Office mandarin, a baron from Treasury, the
Cabinet Office solicitor, two squat-suited earthlings from the Tory middle
benches and three espiocrats of whom Darker was the grandest and poor Harry
Palfrey the most derelict . . . ' Note that Palfrey was the narrator of The
Russia House. He here comes to a suicide's end.
But there have to be various caveats. The first is that we are given 'Jeds',
the usual Le Carre cosmopolitan half-whore, whose qualities (cf. the girl in
The Honourable Schoolboy) do not convincingly sustain their burden in the
plot. 'She had a jewelled brilliance and a kind of dressed nakedness.' Oh
dear. I'm sure she's wonderful as well.
Much more seriously, Le Carre's Whitehall this time is near-impossibly
opaque and confusing, which can only be because he does not allow himself to
develop and characterise his warring factions. We are given Burr, Goodhew,
Rooke and the wicked Darker - but they never begin to achieve the memorable
lineaments of Smiley, Guillam, Hayden, Alleline, etc. in the earlier books.
Even on a second reading these espiocrats blur into each other, which is a
dangerous failing in view of the fact that the heart of the plot turns out
to be double-dealing in Whitehall. We thereby lose, at the end, some of the
story's psychological depth and conviction: and that, ever since The Spy Who
Came In From The Cold, is why we have been reading Le Carre all these years,
and shall continue to look forward to his next.

OXFORD BOOK OF MODERN FAIRY TALES edited by Alison Lurie Oxford Pounds
17.95, 474 pages
Children know something they can't tell; they like Red Riding Hood and the
wolf in bed', Djuna Barnes once remarked, and anyone who has told the story
to a child will know what she meant. Fairy tales are among the oldest forms
of literature, and their survival, told from generation to generation over
centuries, bears witness to their extraordinary psychological power. As
recent Freudian critics have shown, they confront our deepest unconscious
dilemmas - sibling rivalry in Cinderella, sexual fear/desire in Little Red
Riding Hood, terror of abandonment in Hansel and Gretel - in symbolic forms
which console and help us through life.
The modern fairy tale is another animal altogether. It cannot compete with
such primitive, mythic enchantment but, as this enticing new collection
shows, it has attractions of its own. Where Cinderella is timeless and
universal, the modern tale speaks volumes about its author's personality and
the society in which it was written. Where Cinderella is comforting and
familiar, the modern tale is complex and disturbing. And where Cinderella is
effective told in any language or style, the modern tale has a literary
quality which makes it at its best a sophisticated and satisfying work of
art.
So rich is the fairy tale form that, since the Victorians first used it as a
literary model, each generation has mined it for its own purposes. For
Ruskin and Dickens, it was the perfect vehicle for social criticism as well
as a chance to gush about children - Dickens said that to marry Red Riding
Hood would have been perfect bliss. For Oscar Wilde, who wrote stories about
giants loving little boys and romances between male swallows and princely
statues, the tale was a masked plea for sexual tolerance.
Today, fairy tales are fodder for post-modernist inversions and feminist
twists like Angela Carter's 'The Courtship of Mr Lyon', an updated Beauty
and the Beast, or Jeanne Desy's 'The Princess Who Stood on her Own Two
Feet', where a tall and clever princess 'enchants' herself to stop walking
and talking in order not to overpower the chauvinist wimp of a prince who is
courting her.
Alison Lurie's collection has an impressive range, but the book is marred by
an introduction so skimpy that it is quite useless in explaining Ms Lurie's
choice of works, how the stories relate to each other or to traditional
tales, why modern fairy tales matter as literature, or who is intended to
read them - surely not children?
GK Chesterton said that fairy stories were especially enjoyed by the young
because 'children are innocent and love justice, while most of us are wicked
and naturally prefer mercy'. A fascinating element of many modern tales is
that they follow fairy tale forms but deny justice at the end, often to
peculiarly chilling effect. I would have welcomed background from Lurie on,
say, Mrs Clifford's 'The New Mother', a Victorian Hansel and Gretel reeking
of repression and menace, where a mother leaves the children who love her to
punish them for discovering dark secrets, and sends a witch-like 'new
mother' with glass eyes and a wooden tail. And surely Bernard Malamud's sad
1960s 'The Jewbird', about a wise Yiddish crow killed by a frozen-food
salesman, echoes Wilde's 'The Happy Prince', with its kindly swallow frozen
to death: brilliant commentaries, both, on materialistic society.
Explanatory links from Lurie would have made a more elegant, unified volume,
but this book is nonetheless a feast of pleasure and surprise.

THE FORESTWIFE by Theresa Tomlinson Julia MacRae Pounds 8.99, 166 pages
WITH THE exception of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson and Captain
Marryat, historical novels for children in the Victorian era did little more
than provide an opportunity to preach the virtues of the onward march of the
British Empire and its values beneath the thin disguise of spiritedly-told
adventure stories. Henty dashed off 70 of these yarns and his spirit
lingered on until the 1930s when a new generation of writers - Geoffrey
Trease and C. Walter Hodges were among the best of them - brought about a
quiet revolution in children's taste by enabling them to imbibe real facts
about the past in the palatable way that well-wrought fiction can often make
possible.
Theresa Tomlinson is among the strongest of a younger generation of
historical novelists and her two most recent books have explored themes that
have developed from her own researches into the history of Sheffield (where
she lives) and its immediate environs. The Rope Carrier (Julia MacRae Pounds
8.99), a memorable account of the terrible sufferings endured by the
ropemakers who lived in the caves of the Peak District during the 19th
century, was among the outstanding novels of 1991. This month, in The
Forest-wife, she mines a much more ancient seam and one which, though
beginning in Sheffield, moves north into the country which she knew as a
child (Whitby and the coast of north Yorkshire), and south, into Sherwood
Forest.
The Forestwife is set in the time of Richard the Lionheart and, especially,
those years in which the common people were suffering the crippling
consequences of the taxes imposed to fund the Third Crusade. Mary, daughter
to the lord of Holt Manor, is about to be betrothed to an old nobleman at
the behest of her imperious and unloving father. The very thought disgusts
her - she will be nothing better than a breeding sow for a rich old hog. She
escapes in the company of her old wet nurse, Agnes, and the pair of them
make a new life for themselves, eking out a miserable existence in the
perilous wilderness of Barnsdale, home to the Forestwife, a woman whose
powers of healing cause her both be revered by the forest folk and feared as
a witch.
Theresa Tomlinson possesses many of the virtues of style necessary to a
writer of historical fiction for children - an ability to pick and choose
among more or less apposite and authentic details; a manner of factual
presentation that is sharp, clear and simple; and an ear for dialogue.
But perhaps the most pleasing and intriguing aspect of this novel is the way
in which the author draws in, almost by stealth, - the persons of Robin Hood
and his entourage, that outlaw who took his first literary bow in Piers the
Ploughman towards the end of the 14th century. Robin Hood, usually set
firmly to one side in that category labelled 'traditional stories', has had
scant justice done him in recent years as an historical personage. Disney,
predictably, set him in that ahistorical never-never-land of Merrie
Englande. Ian Serraillier's fine re-workings of some of the traditional
ballads in Robin and his Merry Men and Robin in the Greenwood have long been
out of print.
What Theresa Tomlinson has done is to return Robin, Little John, Guy of
Gisborne and others firmly to the era of Richard the Lionheart and
speculates imaginatively, without ever losing sight of the accumulated
ballad lore that has come down to us, upon their roles in a society that
found itself in perpetual turmoil thanks to the machinations of church and
state. Mary, having thrown off the bonds of her father, renames herself
Marian, maid of the woods; Robert, her wet nurse's illegitimate son, having
fought in support of King Richard against his duplicitous cousin John,
becomes her Robin, who promises to return to the Forestwife (Marian assumes
the mantle on the death of Agnes) each May Day and dance with her. Green
woman meets Green man.

THE MAY Corporate Estate Agents' property index reveals a rise of 4.1 per
cent in sales for May compared with May 1992, but a 3.4 per cent fall on
April. Contracts exchanged rose marginally from April but instructions to
sell were down.
March has been the best month for them in 1993. Does this signal a decline
in confidence, as spring promise turned to summer rains with the government
and prime minister stuck in the mud?
News of actual sales and of prices asked continues to be mixed, as you might
expect in a stabilising market. Chesterfield sold 59 Chester Square, London
SW1, with a 57-year lease and a ground rent of Pounds 1,700, for the asking
price of Pounds 1.65m before the brochure was circulated.
Most agents report continued overseas interest in London properties. Even a
Russian has bought a flat in Berkeley House, Hay Hill, London W1, for close
to the guide price of Pounds 775,000 (down from Pounds 1m two years ago)
through Lassmans. In the country, Strutt &amp; Parker in Salisbury, Wilts, sold
The Moot House in Downton near its Pounds 650,000 guide price.
Savills' country department reports selling 10 major properties in May with
a value approaching Pounds 11m, including three sales where terms were
agreed and contracts exchanged within 48 hours. Prices, the firm believes,
were 10-15 per cent higher than in August 1992, and two fifths of the buyers
were from abroad.
On the other hand some asking prices continue downwards. Carscombe, a 17th
century house at Stoodleigh near Tiverton in Devon which was a safe house
for the Cavaliers during the Civil War, stood unsold for a year at Pounds
425,000. It is now re-priced at Pounds 325,000 for the house with six
bedrooms, five bathrooms, a swimming pool and 20 acres, from Jackson-Stops
in Exeter (0392-214 222) and Lane Fox in Tiverton (0884-242468).
Similarly Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Exeter (0392-433 033) offers the
Northmoor estate on Exmoor, on sale now for the second time in two years, at
a total guide price for the lots of Pounds 560,000, which is 25 per cent
down on last time. And Telham Hill House near Battle, in East Sussex, is
reduced by Pounds 115,000 to offers over Pounds 300,000 from Strutt &amp; Parker
in Lewes (0273-475 411).
The largest recent reduction is a curio of history: the fortress called No
Man's Land in the middle of the Solent, built to counter a possible threat
from France under Napoleon III with 49 guns and 400 men. It took 20 years to
finish. Gladstone was opposed to it being built when he was chancellor
because of the cost, which led Queen Victoria to say: 'Better to lose
Gladstone than to lose Portsmouth.' Three years ago it was on offer at
Pounds 5.75m, after being, rebuilt as a luxurious abode. Last year, it came
down to Pounds 2.5m. Now, it is Pounds 950,000. Call Knight Frank &amp; Rutley
(071-629-8171) for the ultimate in offshore island getaways, with three
helicopter pads. If no buyer appears, it will be sold by informal tender on
September 10.
For pricing normal properties the moral is that the guide price must be
realistic, not greedy; then, a good place will sell quickly. There is a
danger that vendors will wait too long in the hope of getting more. They may
find that sentiment has turned down by the time they have nerved themselves
to enter the market.
Selling your house without an agent is unusual but Virginia Pryor is doing
it with Lady's Cottage at Melton Constable, in north Norfolk. It has five
bedrooms, three bathrooms, an annexe/granny flat/holiday cottage and 72
acres of woods. Locals say DH Lawrence used to stay nearby and found the
cottage hidden in the woods with a gamekeeper living in it, which partly
gave him the idea for Lady Chatterley's Lover. The guide price is Pounds
445,000. Inquiries to 0263-860 980.

FT  26 JUN 93 / The Property Market: The lasting appeal of a country cottage
 -Gerald Cadogan explains why they remain at a premium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW DO you view cottages? As places of rural romance for weekenders to shake
off the city's smoke and roar? Or as dark, damp and draughty country slums
with outside lavatories, pumps for water, and smoky, decrepit cooking
ranges?
Both views can be true; yet, even at worst, the dream factor in cottages
remains. To many people, there is enormous appeal in going to the local
market to buy home-made jam and cakes from the Women's Institute stall, or
to the pub for bitter beer and rustic wisdom distilled over centuries. Mix
in village cricket matches and hollyhocks in the garden and you see why
people pay a premium for such homes.
Take Lilac Cottage in Henham Road, Elsenham, Hertfordshire, described as 'a
16th century cottage overlooking the village cricket field.' Listed grade
II, and with two (or three) bedrooms, it is offered by Mullucks Wells for
Pounds 155,000.
A recent survey prepared by the PR Department, which represents estate
agents in the home counties, reveals that the cottage market is picking up,
especially in Surrey and Sussex; indeed, there are more inquiries from
possible buyers than cottages for sale. 'Many potential vendors are waiting
to see whether prices will rise,' says David Bedford, of estate agent
Bedford.
The survey found that while buyers tend towards cottages in good condition
or needing a minimum of work, the unregenerate cottage has not vanished
altogether. For centuries, these were the homes of the rural poor; and while
many have been refurbished, plenty survive as the vernacular architecture of
the countryside, using the different local materials.
Two important criteria for buying a cottage are its location (the further
from London, generally the cheaper) and what it is made of. Are you willing
to renew the thatch regularly, or will you choose one with a tile or slate
roof?
If you are looking for thatch and pink paint, Mullucks Wells offers Chaureth
Cottage at Cherry Green, near Bishop's Stortford in Hertfordshire, for
Pounds 138,500 while Bedford has Fir Cottage at Hengrave, near Bury St
Edmunds in Suffolk, for Pounds 159,500.
Also pink and thatched is Roudham Lodge, a gem of a Victorian Gothic cottage
with lancet windows, flint chimney stacks and rusticated woodwork supporting
the projecting eaves. Listed grade II, with three bedrooms, it belonged to a
big house near Norwich and costs around Pounds 79,000 from Savills.
In brick, Bedford is selling the straightforward two-up, two-down Oak
Cottage at Rougham, near Bury St Edmunds, for Pounds 89,000 and a 1967-built
thatched cottage called Bridge House at Dalham, near Newmarket, for Pounds
120,000. Overlooking the green at Blackmore End, near Braintree in Essex, is
Mission Cottage, the old mission hall; Pounds 145,000 from Mullucks Wells.
To buy in southern counties costs more. In Hampshire, Lane Fox in Winchester
is selling Rose Cottage at Cheriton, near Alresford, for Pounds 245,000
while its Basingstoke office has Blaegrove Cottage at nearby Up Nately for
Pounds 300,000. Both are timbered, thatched and listed.
In Surrey, Browns in Cranleigh offers the brick, stone and hung-tile
three-bedroom Malthouse Cottage at Hambledon, near Godalming, for Pounds
250,000, and its Guildford office has the timbered, 16th century,
two-bedroom Millmeadow Cottage at Bramley, near Guildford, for Pounds
225,000.
For that price in Dorset, you can buy the four-bedroomed stone-and-thatch
Chapel Cottage (which incorporates the old village chapel as a second
reception room), in Melbury Osmond, near Sherborne. Humberts offers it on a
leasehold as part of an estate.
Strutt &amp; Parker in Salisbury is selling the white-painted Rookery Cottage in
nearby Orcheston for Pounds 98,000. In the Lambourn valley, near Newbury in
Berkshire, Mallard Cottage at Easton has three bedrooms, a stable (or
office) and tack room for Pounds 155,000 (from Strutt &amp; Parker). It is well
placed for the M4, which also is one way to reach the Cotswolds from London;
the M40 is the other.
In those cottage-strewn hills, Hill Cottage at Great Rissington, in the
Windrush valley, is on offer at Pounds 135,000 from Carter Jonas - a good
weekend nest but perhaps too tight for permanent occupation.
A larger cottage is the School House on the village green at Whichford, near
Shipston-on-Stour; for Pounds 170,000 from Hurley Lloyd Thorpe.
For a single-bedroom weekend getaway, the same firm has Pixie Cottage at
Naunton, near Stow-on-the-Wold, for Pounds 67,500; and, with Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley, HLT offers Paynes Cottage at Broadwell, between Stow and
Moreton-in-Marsh, for Pounds 65,000. Meanwhile, in Tingewick, near
Buckingham, KFR is selling the three-bedroomed Wood Lane Cottage for around
Pounds 150,000.
The south-west offers good value. Stags in South Molton, Devon, offers
Hollow Tree near Chulmleigh, a white-painted thatched cottage that used to
be a farmhouse. The asking price of Pounds 115,000 also includes a listed
barn, a stable with three loose boxes, and a paddock.
For Pounds 109,000 (reduced from Pounds 150,000), Millerson has the Old
Cottage at Lewdown, near Okehampton, which has been converted from a row of
quarry workers' cottages. The price includes fishing on the river Lew.
As a finale, two intriguing properties. One is the 1848 Enoch's Tower, a
folly at Stow-on-the-Wold with an extension giving three bedrooms; from
Hurley Lloyd Thorpe for Pounds 149,950.
The other is Magazine Cottage at Sedgeford, north Norfolk, from agents
Bedford. The cottage was a royalist powder magazine in the civil war and was
converted into a home in 1860, when it might also have been a prison. What a
history for Pounds 119,500.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Travel: Calvados and Breton pipes - Chris Eales feasts on
Celtic music and masses of Muscadet in Brittany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS EALES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MYSTERIOUSLY, the pedal of my bike snapped right outside Jean-Michel
Veilion's cottage.
He is a neighbour in Pluzunet, a tiny, lively village on Brittany's Cote
d'Armor and one hour's drive south-east of Roscoff. He is also one of the
finest flute players in the whole of this Celtic corner of France.
As we sipped powerful calvados made from local apples, Jean-Michel mentioned
a musical happening. He called it a boeuf, a free feast of Celtic music
offered casually by local musicians who sit and play right through the night
in the bar.
But which bar and when? It was confirmed later by Olivier, the boulanger,
whom I met as I pushed my disabled bike through the village square. The
boeuf would be in Pluzunet itself, that very Saturday night. Oliver did not
know which bar but there are only two and the respective landladies agree
not to open at the same time.
I ended up, some time after 10pm, in L'Eclipse, chez Francoise. You could
stumble on a boeuf in any number of bars on the Cote d'Armor, indeed
throughout the far western regions of Brittany. Ever since the British Celts
arrived in the 5th century, the French influence has been clawing and
creeping westward.
But here, at a safe distance from Paris, the maestros perform a friendly
Celtic combination, stopping only occasionally to down a demi. Lively
fiddle, violin, biniou (a Breton bagpipe), clarinet and Irish drum blend
with sweet, soothing melodies of flute and acoustic guitar.
Often, Irish singers accompany Bretons and together they bring emotive rural
tales of times past to life. Oddly, L'Eclipse was quiet when I arrived. I
was not in the wrong place: Francoise told me that the musicians had been
due an hour-and-a-half earlier.
None of the regulars appeared bothered. A couple of ruddy-faced farmers were
happily knocking back glasses of red and the man who is always there was
there. He wore his normal glazed expression unbroken by curling smoke from a
yellow Gitane wedged between his lips.
No boeuf? I asked. 'Ah, peut - etre,' they said. I decided to linger.
Conversation turned to Pluzunet's last musical event, a super fest-noz in
the Salles des Fetes where 600 people had danced the night away a week
earlier.
A fest-noz - night festival - is a mesmerising experience. More than
entertainment, it is in the soul of village life in western and central
Brittany. Local papers and posters tell of at least one fest-noz in their
area every week at any time of the year. People dance all night in huge
circles, linked only by their hands, arms or little fingers, stepping
intricate movements in perfect rhythm to rousing music.
Breton professors think that the plinn, a simple round dance, was probably a
pagan sun ritual. The incredible foot movements developed from the way in
which neighbours helped flatten wheat and stamp smooth the earth floors of
primitive stone houses.
Now, as then, singers, of all ages, sometimes children, even farmers in
their 80s, chant unaccompanied in Breton, an ancient language, tales of
love, witchcraft and of sons gone to sea.
Young musicians add spice by mixing funky electric guitar and bass with
traditional Celtic instruments. Flushed dancers can buy cider, coreff (the
local brew), wine and crepes until the early hours.
In the summer, the fest-noz moves outside to the splendid grounds of ancient
chateaux, chapel courtyards and village squares. In the middle of August
last year I drove 15 minutes north from Pluzunet to the rugged coast at
Tregastel, to a sailing spectacle where Breton jazz and rock groups played
on the quay side.
It is an annual event. People camp on the beach. Most let their hair down
and dance to the music or consume vast amounts of inexpensive Muscadet and
moules marinieres. Enthusiastic sailors compete in a test of endurance.
The biggest Celtic music event in Brittany, at Lorient, in Finistere, on the
south-west coast, is worth visiting. Thousands descend on the city between
August 6-15 to indulge in an orgy of music and a feast of charcuterie,
saucisson, soupe de poisson, galettes, crepes and moules.
I had been right to linger with a demi in L'Elipse. At midnight, the bar was
beginning to fill up and I had spotted Iffic Troadic, a local musician, at
the bar. Suddenly he began to chant in Breton. The bar fell silent as he
recounted a sobering tale of a son from the neighbouring village of Cavan
who returned to his dying mother after years at sea.
Then a flautist appeared, a guitarist and a drummer. The boeuf had begun.
A summer school of traditional Breton and Irish dancing at Mantallot, 15km
from the northern coast of Brittany, will arrange accommodation and food as
well as dancing lessons, walks, and story-telling evenings. Details: write
to Kanfarted ar Vilin Gozh, Mairie, Mantallot, France 22450. Tel: (010) 33
96 35 89 84.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Travel: And the Wurlitzer plays on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GILBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT SOUNDS an unprepossessing address for a shrine, 706 Union Avenue. But Sun
Studio, a modest two-storey brownstone building in downtown Memphis,
Tennessee, has a better claim than anywhere to be the place where rock 'n'
roll began. The Elvis legend started there in 1953 when the 18-year-old
truck-driver with sideburns made a demo record in Sam Phillips's tiny Sun
Studio.
Sun Studio is now back in the recording business after a neglected period as
a garage and a barber shop. It is a guaranteed crowd-puller, and I paid
Dollars 4 for the tour. The plastic lights and battered acoustic tiles are
the same as 40 years ago. The control booth has been modernised to
accommodate the likes of U2 and Ringo Starr, but the intimate atmosphere
that produced the breathless, shivering sounds of early Elvis remains
intact.
Period instruments lie on the studio floor, and I clutched the same upright
microphone that Presley used. The humble Sun Studio cafe next door provides
the best hamburgers in Memphis, a remarkable Dixie fried banana pie, and a
Wurlitzer that only plays Sun singles.
Memphis and music are intertwined: the historic Beale Street area has been
restored, with plenty of restaurants and music venues, but the raffish
reputation of the 1920s, when jug bands and gambling joints were everywhere,
has almost disappeared. BB King's blues club had some fine raw soul music
the night I went. It also had 100 conventioneering Tennessee realtors.
Memphis is rightly proud of its musical heritage, but it is also the home of
America's first Civil Rights Museum. The Lorraine Motel, the site of Martin
Luther King's assassination in 1968, has been converted into a powerful
museum of interpretive exhibits that bring to life the story of the civil
rights movement from the 1950s to the present. Martin Luther King's room has
been preserved exactly as it was when he was shot on an upper balcony.
It is jarring to cross town to Elvis Presley Boulevard on the same day and
see Graceland, Presley's home from 1957 until his death. Around 700,000
people tour this 1930s southern-style mansion each year. Only the White
House has more visitors. For Dollars 7.95 you get a strictly guided tour.
The iron gates are decorated with musical notes and the graffiti of
thousands of fans.
The guides are a mine of information as they convey you around the two lower
levels of the house (Elvis's aunt still lives upstairs). 'This grand piano
is covered in gold leaf - a present from Priscilla,' says Sharonda as we
gaze across the roped-off living room. The white leather sofas are long
enough to accommodate a football team and the Jungle Room is decorated like
an Hawaiian cocktail. The Trophy Room catalogues Elvis's career: scores of
stage costumes, 300 gold and platinum records, school reports, letters from
presidents.
Outside, the guitar-shaped swimming pool and a private shooting gallery
indicate how Elvis was imprisoned within his own fantasy. An English devotee
next to me knelt down to pick up some garden leaves and murmured: 'What a
souvenir - genuine Graceland leaves.' The tour ends in the Meditation Garden
where Elvis is buried between his parents. The eternal flame on his bronze
gravestone is surrounded by guitar-shaped wreaths and tributes freshly
placed by fans: 'Elvis, the most beautiful star in the sky. Love from Kiki
and Roberta.'
It is a three hour-drive along Interstate 40 from West Tennessee to
Nashville, a sprawling, amiable city dominated by music. Every waitress
seems to be an aspiring Patsy, Tammy or Dolly. Songwriters advertise their
wares on telegraph poles: 'Doug Rehm has NEW SONGS for consideration'.
Businessmen who have nothing to do with music are knowledgeable about the
new country stars like Alan Jackson and Reba McIntyre.
Over 200 recording studios and music publishers are scattered around
Nashville, but the heartland is along Music Row on 16th Avenue where the
Country Music Hall of Fame has exhibits and artefacts. It traces the
development of different strands of country music with films and videos,
original instruments and manuscripts.
Nearby is RCA's legendary Studio B where Elvis recorded 250 songs over 20
years. We gazed at the battered recording console which mixed his songs, as
well as those of Jim Reeves, Roy Orbison, the Everlys and Dolly Parton.
Back on the highway we headed south-east to pay tribute to two other
Tennessee landmarks - Jack Daniel's distillery and Chattanooga. Mister Jack
put a small village called Lynchburg on the map in the 1860s when he began
distilling his unique 'sour mash' with the help of a spring water stream and
charcoal filtering. Paradoxically, Lynchburg is a 'dry area': our guide
warned us at the start of our walk round the distillery that it would be a
'sniffing, not a drinking tour.'
We smelt the vats, we saw the iron-free spring water and the whisky seeping
drop by drop through the maplewood charcoal. We even saw hillside warehouses
packed with 47m gallons of Jack Daniel's. But there was not a drop to drink
until we crossed the county line, seven miles away.
Further east, Chattanooga sprawls along the Moccasin Bend of the Tennessee
River at the foot of Lookout Mountain. The Chattanooga Choo-Choo, Track 29
and the terminal station are all now part of a Holiday Inn complex: restored
railway sleeping cars have become restaurants.
Ten miles south of the city, America's oldest national military park at
Chickamauga commemorates the bloodiest battle of the Civil War in 1863, when
Union and Confederate armies fought to gain control of the key rail centre
of Chattanooga with the loss of 35,000 lives. Even today bullets are
sometimes found in the dense woodland and undergrowth.
Finally, I needed no urging to travel on to East Tennessee where the Great
Smoky Mountains straddle the border with North Carolina for 60 miles. The
bluish mist which clings to the mountainsides and gave the peaks their name
is turning increasingly grey because of pollution, but the Smokies have
earned their title of the 'crown jewels of the Appalachians' because of the
exceptional variety of trees, flowers and wildlife in this superb national
park.
If you find a traffic hold-up on a mountain road here, it is almost certain
to be the result of a 'bear jam': 500 black bears live in the park and
tourists leap out of their cars to snap them whenever they appear among the
greenery.
Richard Gilbert travelled with American Airlines Holidays, which offers
various flexible fly-drive packages to Nashville on scheduled flights from
Heathrow, Gatwick, Stanstead, Manchester and Glasgow via Chicago or Dallas.

THE temple-bells are callin', an'
it's there that I would be -
By the old Moulmein Pagoda,
looking lazy at the sea.
 - Rudyard Kipling
SADLY, the shrugged shoulders of Burmese officialdom told me that a
modern-day Kipling would have to stay put in Rangoon.
Moulmein is the largest city of southern Burma, and during the colonial days
its port teemed with vessels laden with teak and rubber heading for the four
corners of the empire.
Foreigners have long been kept away from the area, as the government has
been determined to segregate them from the disgruntled minority Mon and
Karen inhabitants. However, the combination of a government campaign to
procure tourist dollars and a lot of persistence eventually won me a ticket
for the Moulmein Express.
Trains are the most sensible form of transport in Burma, given the poor
state of the roads and the track record of its airline. I was disappointed
to find that Rangoon's grand post-colonial station, with its combination of
Victorian awnings and Burmese towers, was actually orderly; a barbed wire
fence separated hangers-on from the comparatively modern Korean train that
awaited.
The train departed on time, and there was an immediate change in atmosphere.
A parade of turbanned caterers wearing the ubiquitous flip-flops and Burmese
longyi (an extended teatowel with a myriad of patterns, which is wrapped
around the waist), marched through the carriage offering anything from what
looked like barbecued sparrows to a palatable chicken curry.
'Burmese people are always eating. Their problem is not that they are
hungry, it is that they have little money and no freedom,' a man confided in
Rangoon. It became immediately evident that starvation was not going to be a
problem.
Nor was isolation. Throughout Burma one reads government slogans on
billboards proclaiming: 'Love your Motherland, Respect the Law', or: 'Only
with Discipline can there be Progress', but this seems to have had little
effect on the open and friendly temperament of the people.
The train wound its way around the delta of the Sittang River, and then
southwards. Village stations had a festive air, in spite of the wire
fencing. Baskets of chrysanthemums, or earthenware pots of water, were
balanced on heads and presented through the train window, as the platforms
became market places on our arrival.
The girls all had patterns marked on their faces with a mud-like paste,
which I assumed to have some religious significance. I was informed,
however, that it is the local form of make-up, made from a mix of bark and
water. 'Very beautiful. Only lazy women don't wear it', a trishaw driver
told me later.
The journey was punctuated by the inevitable one-hour delay for locomotive
repair. After 10 hours of paddy fields, pagodas and searing heat, the
express train pulled through a breaker's yard for old British steam engines,
and drew to a halt at Martaban. Across the Salween river, Moulmein lay
shimmering, dominated by its old pagoda on the hill above the town.
Within minutes of arrival, I was accosted by an excited immigration officer
in a cowboy hat, who took me to the top of a two-tier British ferry and
insisted that I fill in all manner of forms, which occupied the 20-minute
crossing to the town.
He was most concerned that I should not leave the city centre, since it was
surrounded by 'black zones', where he said I might be shot at. After making
numerous promises, and being introduced to his boss, I was then escorted to
the Number 8 Guest House.
The cowboy proudly pointed out that I would be sharing this with a famous
Rangoon pop band called Aurora, but the cell-like rooms and mildewed shower
stalls indicated that in Burma, pop stardom is not as it is in the West.
I never encountered the band, but as the town's lone tourist I had my own
difficulties seeking anonymity. A stroll to one of the outlying villages to
see a pagoda resulted in my being taken on an escorted tour by the village
headman, with 100 waving people parading behind.
The focus of the city, which has a population or around 200,000, is its old
Kyaikthanlan pagoda, which lies behind the town on a ridge of hills running
parallel to the river.
The soldier in Kipling's poem Mandalay looked down from here upon 'elephints
a-pilin teak'. As a sign of the times, the biggest landmark now is the
town's fortress-like prison. A Burmese whispered that it holds more than
5,000 people, many of them political prisoners.
The elephants had gone, but little else can have changed. I looked over a
line of hazy jungle-covered hills all topped with white pagodas, acres of
lush palm trees, and a river crowded with small wooden sailing junks and old
steamers. The pagoda was full of young monks playing hide-and-seek in their
deep red robes, and schoolgirls chattering. There was not much meditation.
One of the temples around the base of the bell-shaped golden pagoda even
contained a small merry-go-round, with flashing lights and statues of
Buddhas holding out bowls. The aim was to throw notes into the bowls. The
winners earn merit, and one step further in the direction of Nirvana. I
missed.
The high ground above Moulmein definitely belongs to Buddha, with pagodas
marking every hill top. But surprisingly, the town itself appears to have
become the territory of Islam.
The Indians, who were brought over from the British Raj to work the teak
plantations in the late 19th century, have built a massive twin-towered
mosque in the centre, and their presence was noticeable throughout.
The houses along the high street were wooden-fronted, with bright colours
contrasting with black wrought-iron balconies, and the streets were crowded
with bullock carts and ancient buses. There were only two obvious
concessions to a post-colonial era: a gun-boat on the Salween River and a
comparatively modern cinema, showing the film Coolie Killer.
The town's major focus is the covered market, stacked with cheap
Chinese-made goods. The demand for western goods became painfully apparent
when someone started negotiating a price for the shirt I was wearing.
I set off for Kyaikto, to see the famous golden pagoda. The Kyaiktiyo pagoda
is only 5ft high, but it is built on a giant gold-leaf-coated boulder which
looks as though it should roll off the cliff on which it is perched.
The reason it does not, legend has it, is because it is held up by a hair of
the Buddha. For this reason, the four-hour hike up a steep incline is the
Burmese equivalent of the Canterbury pilgrimage.
An 83-year-old hiker assured me that I would gain significant merit from the
ascent. What he could not explain was why all the stores along the path sold
bamboo rocket launchers and guns, with the inscription 'Rambo', as toys for
the children. My memories of Burma are of smiling faces, golden pagodas -
and guns.

or the mysterious lack of it - and Steffi Graf's security problems seemed to
dominate the headlines during a busy and wonderfully sunny first week at
Wimbledon where the British men at last distinguished themselves.
Inspired perhaps by Jeremy Bates' progress to the fourth round last year,
Andrew Foster has reached the same stage this time. This afternoon Chris
Wilkinson opens the Centre Court programme in a third round match against
the two-time former champion and No 2 seed, Stefan Edberg. In mid-week, Mark
Petchey and Chris Bailey also covered themselves in glory while failing
heroically against two of the higher ranked men.
Foster, a lanky 21-year-old who has benefitted from the new Lawn Tennis
Association coaching structure, first beat Thomas Enqvist of Sweden, the
1991 Wimbledon junior champion, in five sets. That was an impressive
performance for a man ranked 329 in the world who had recently changed his
double-handed backhand for a single-handed stroke. Then Foster scored a
straight sets win over Mexico's Luis Herrera who last year had ended the
distinguished career of Jimmy Connors on his way to the third round.
'That's probably as well as I've ever played. It's certainly the best I've
ever concentrated' said Foster afterwards.
Yesterday Foster was lucky when Andrei Olhovskiy, the Russian, who had
surprised top seeded Jim Courier last year, retired complaining of dizziness
and sickness with Foster leading 6-3 6-5. Next on Foster's menu is top seed
and world No 1, Pete Sampras. That should be a tasty dish for one with
nothing to lose  - but do not expect miracles.
Southampton-born Wilkinson made the most of a fortunate draw and an affinity
with grass to beat first Argentina's Daniel Orsanic, who was bred on clay,
and then the qualifier from Canada, Sebastien Lareau. Ranked 187 in the
world, 42 places below Wilkinson. Lareau lists Robert Ludlum as one of his
favourite authors. So uncomfortable did he look while losing in straight
sets on an alien surface that he would doubtless have preferred to be on the
Road to Gandolfo for an Osterman Weekend]
Wilkinson continued his winning ways in doubles. With Paul Hand he beat the
American Jensen brothers, Luke and Murphy, who two weeks ago had become the
French Open doubles champions. Then, with Clare Wood, he beat Byron Talbot
and Andrea Tamesvari in the first round of the mixed.
Wilkinson is undaunted by the prospect of facing Edberg this afternoon. 'I'm
playing well enough to beat anyone' he said confidently. Eyebrows were
raised when he added 'I'm only thinking about winning the tournament.'
Petchey and Bailey can count themselves unlucky not to have joined Foster
and Wilkinson in the third round. Both competed with courage to create
winning chances that slipped through their fingers. Petchey, who lives in
Loughton, was cheered by an army of supporters from Essex on Court 13 on
Thursday as he raised hopes of a first big upset. With some aggressive
serve-and-volley play, Petchey built a two sets to one lead against Jakob
Hlasek, who not so long ago had been ranked No 7 in the world. In spite of
holding a match point at 6-5 in the final set the 223 ranked Petchey
eventually went down 7-6 4-6 6-7 6-2 10-8.
The real drama came late in the day on the Centre Court. Bailey, a 6 ft 5 in
giant, faced the No 5 seed Ivanisevic who had come within two points of
winning last year's Wimbledon final against Agassi. On the face of it the
25-year-old Briton had little chance against the fastest server in tennis
who last year delivered 206 aces during his seven matches on the Wimbledon
lawns.
Only four years ago Bailey's career had been threatened when he had snapped
the anterior cruciate ligament in one of his knees. It cost him two years.
Yet after two operations and months of physical rehabilitation here he was
playing on the Centre Court for the first time. Such was Bailey's athletic
commitment and skill in the forecourt - particularly on the first volley  -
that the Norfolk man had Ivanisevic in despair. To the delight of the
shamelessly supportive Centre Court crowd Bailey took a two sets to one lead
and was ahead 2-0 and 30-0 in the fourth. In allowing Ivanisevic to escape
with that set Bailey showed his relative lack of experience.
The final set boiled to a thrilling climax as Bailey, refusing to be
intimidated by some fierce left-handed serves and flashing passes down the
lines, forced his way to match point on the Ivanisevic serve at 6-5.
Ivanisevic unleashed a huge second serve that struck the net and bounced in.
A let. On the replay Ivanisevic hit an even faster one down the middle line
 - his 32nd ace. It was the act of a desperate man and, for Bailey, a cruel
blow. Ivanisevic went on to break Bailey and then served out the match with
supreme confidence, ending it with his 34th ace. The 5-7 7-6 6-7 6-4 9-7
victory had taken 3 hours and 35 minutes and the Centre Court clock stood at
8.40pm. As the two men left in the gathering darkness they were given a
standing ovation.
British tennis should thank Billy Knight. Three years ago, this former
British No 1, always a gritty fighter, was persuaded by LTA training chief,
Richard Lewis, to work with the younger men alongside his old doubles
partner, Tony Pickard, who had become the Davis Cup captain.
Knight's unquenchable spirit is beginning to filter through. Britain's
present players are starting to believe they can be as good as the rest of
the world. For Bailey, Foster, Wilkinson and Petchey that is a welcome
discovery. Now the hard work begins in translating this advance into results
on the ATP Tour. I hope these four, and the younger men behind them like
James Baily, Tim Henman and Jamie Delgardo, are ready to accept the
challenge.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Sport: The dinosaurs may still rule the world / A look at
the battle between two types of giant yacht - Sailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY

<TEXT>
ONE OF the problems of predicting form in the Whitbread race is that nothing
else replicates the gruelling conditions and length of a 32,000-mile contest
around the world. Fast off the Needles may mean nothing off Cape Horn.
Nevertheless, a number of the Whitbread entries were keen to shape up
against one another in the recent UAP Round Europe race. Another clutch
leaves the US on Saturday in the New York-Southampton race. This event will
match the British youth/disabled crew of Dolphin against the wily grand
master, Dennis Conner, at the helm of his money-no-object entry Winston.
Also in that fleet will be the US Women's Challenge led by Nance Frank. She
actually turned back on the start-line of the 1989-90 Whitbread because of
lack of funds. This time, following the example of Maiden four years ago,
sponsors have been found for a women's crew. No one now doubts the ability
of the distaff side, fore or aft of the mast.
A topic of impassioned debate is whether the new Whitbread 60 class of
water-ballasted mono-hulls will prove faster than the 30 per cent larger IOR
maxis they are to race against. Although the classes are separate, skippers
who have chosen the newer boats are itching to show they can beat the
'dinosaurs' around the world.
Three maxis entered the Round Europe and three W60s. Although the data is
incomplete, both designers and sailors were agreed that the bigger yachts
should be quicker upwind and in the lighter airs. When the breeze goes aft
and freshens up a little, one maxi skipper, Lawrie Smith of Fortuna,
believes the W60s could be up to 100 miles a day (or 30 per cent) faster.
The third leg of the Round Europe from Cherbourg to Rotterdam looked set to
be a perfect test of maxis against W60s. A southerly breeze was solid from
the south-south-west, giving a high-speed reach up-Channel to the Low
Countries.
Grant Dalton, skipper of the maxi New Zealand Endeavour, said before the
start: 'If the W60s are ever going to prove they can be faster than the
maxis, today is the day.' Dalton, an experienced Kiwi who skippered Fisher &amp;
Paykel in the race four years ago, is said to have spent Dollars 50,000
(Pounds 33,333) with designer Bruce Farr simply for a detailed study on
which type of yacht would prove quicker around the global track.
Aboard the W60s off Cherbourg that sunny morning, there was a similar mood
of anticipation. Intrum Justitia crew member Gunnar Krantz said: 'For the
first time ever, we will really be able to see the potential speeds of the
W60s, which I'm sure will give the maxi class a run for its money.'
Heading east from the Cherbourg peninsula, a Spanish W60, Galicia 93
Pescanova, took an early lead but was overtaken during the first night by
Intrum Justitia. However, as the wind died away on the 250-mile leg, the
maxi yachts, with their vastly bigger sail plan, were able to take the lead.
The first three yachts into Rotterdam were the maxi-ketches NZ Endeavour,
Merit Cup and La Poste, with only 18 minutes separating first and third.
Intrum Justitia was the leading W60, just 66 minutes behind the Kiwis.
Dalton went on to win the Round Europe overall. 'It has been like a
mini-Whitbread,' he said. 'The racing between the maxis has been so close.
We are so similar that I think this Whitbread will see the closest racing
there has ever been, in both classes.'
Among the W60s, there was quiet confidence. Galicia, winner of the smaller
division of the Round Europe, was launched only two weeks before the start
and its crew had never sailed together before the delivery trip from Vigo to
La Rochelle. The yacht was far from optimised but had delivered excellent
speed 'right out of the box.' The same was true for Intrum Justitia although
the Italian W60, Brooksfield, was off the pace and is to be modified.
In the southern hemisphere, meanwhile, Chris Dickson - the young skipper who
so nearly won the America's Cup for New Zealand six years ago - has
finalised the strategy for his first Whitbread. Dickson has been running a
two-boat testing programme for the past three months.
After thousands of miles of racing between his boats, Dickson has chosen the
Farr design from his duo. Farr, an expatriate Kiwi who lives on the US east
coast, has had more victories in the 20-year history of the Whitbread than
any other designer. It will be christened Tokio in deference to the
consortium of Japanese businesses that have financed Dickson.
The second boat, developed by West Australian naval architect John
Swarbrick, was no dog; indeed, it was favoured by some Dickson crewmen and a
number of serious buyers have been looking at it. 'It was a very tough
decision,' said Dickson, from Auckland. 'Both boats had been optimised and
are close to their full potential.
'I would have been happy to do the race in either one of them. The decision
was taken with an open mind, purely on the basis of scientific performance
tests.'
Perhaps. Top sailors are instinctively a conservative bunch and have a
history of shunning radical boats in favour of one that looks like last
year's winner. The British team led by Harold Cudmore did just that in the
1986-87 America's Cup, preferring the classic (but slow) White Crusader to
David Hollom's developmental 12-metre.
Swarbrick has been the bridesmaid before. In 1987, the Kookaburra syndicate,
which defended the cup for Australia against Conner, rejected Swarbrick's
boat in favour of a more cautious approach from skipper Iain Murray. Stars &amp;
Stripes won 'four-zip' (as Conner would say) and the Auld Mug went to San
Diego.

I SHARED a taxi from the station to Lord's with three people I had seen at a
county match but did not know. They wanted to cut their losses on fares, if
not results. They knew England were going to lose. We all knew that, before
the match started. What kept us deep in discussion was the nature of the
loss and the changes it might prompt. We planned a new future for English
cricket.
One of the few virtues of watching Test cricket in England now is that it
makes you look forward, not back. For the selectors to go back in times of
trouble to ageing players such as Mike Gatting and Neil Foster is a stop-gap
move with no long-term point. It is not part of a clear policy. We agreed on
that, inspiring our driver to declare: 'We need a really crushing defeat, a
total, wipe-the-floor, smashed-to-bits, down-and-out defeat.' He warmed to
his topic. 'Then we can get young blood in the team. That's our only hope.'
All the prescriptions offered were our 'only hope.' Youth, Botham, a new
system of cricket organisation, no more Essex, no more foreigners, a better
captain - each of these was put forward. The media sees a new spirit as the
key to success, but that begs the question. Of course confidence and
aggression would help England win, as they have helped Australia so far, but
England are unlikely to acquire these qualitites without a win.
I think perhaps a county win over the Australians might help, stripping the
emperor of some of the clothes with which English ineptitude has adorned
him. On England's part, something should be seen to be done to create a
climate of initiative, never one of the cricketing establishment's strong
points.
Chris Lewis came out of the winter tour to India with more credit than most,
but looks now to have been allowed simply to stay in the team rather than
being selected to fight Australia. Nor has Robin Smith done much recently to
keep his place. A sort of mental ailment seems to infect all who join the
Test management squad, numbing their perception and sense of purpose.
It has infected the once-cavalier chairman of selectors, Ted Dexter, and the
once-wily team manager Keith Fletcher, who is in decline along with his
team. Take Lewis again. He is a superb fielder but dropped a straight catch
off David Boon (then 77) with the air of someone who felt it was hardly
worth going for broke because it would not change the result, likewise his
suicidal batting just before lunch in England's second innings.
The trouncing at Lord's has worsened this feeling of being pre-destined to
lose, and the taxi driver might be right that the only hope is a massive
shake-up. It should start with the opening bowlers and batsmen. They do more
than set the scene; they grasp the game as soon as it begins.
England were already defeated when they walked out to bat after Australia
declared at 632 for four. That is why Mike Atherton's 80 and 99 were so
impressive - they were solitary, heroic, and against all odds. Indeed, in
the quiet glades of unofficial gambling at Lord's, someone told me that,
after the declaration, he had offered odds of 10,000/1 against England
winning - but there were no takers. An English victory was beyond a bet; it
was a fantasy. Once they had failed to break through Australia's opening
partnership, they had lost the game.
Leaving aside the serried ranks of England's first-change bowling talent, a
penetrating opening pair is crucial. But where to find them? Devon Malcolm
is sometimes wayward but does at least bowl fast; if nothing else, that
should have novelty value. So might Kent's Mark Ilott who, while only
fast-medium, is a left-armer. Or Surrey's Martin Bicknell, who can swing the
ball late. Speed and swing have been missing noticeably from England's
bowling lately.
Where opening batsmen are concerned, the irony is that there is a positive
traffic jam of them on the county circuit. As a pair, skipper Graham Gooch
and Atherton have lost the rhythm with which once they opened the English
innings; and, if Gooch retires soon or stands down as opener, the selectors
may be inclined towards replacing him with Alec Stewart. Yet, this would not
be a strong choice although he does need to be relieved of the ill-fitting
burden of wicket-keeping.
With more enterprise, they could choose another left-handed Kentishman in
Mark Benson; Derbyshire's Peter Bowler; or Somerset's Mark Lathwell, who has
become a symbol of young and dashing cricket (the sort that tends to make
the selectors look like a gang of agorophobic godfathers). Mike Slater had
less experience of first-class cricket than Lathwell when he and Mark Taylor
destroyed England with their opening 260 at Lord's. He was pleased to be
chosen for this (his first) Test series, but not unduly surprised. Clutching
a beer afterwards, he beamed and shrugged. 'I felt good. The pitch felt
good. Why not do well?' Try telling that to an English cricketer just now.
I am glad Gooch is to stay in charge for the third Test at Trent Bridge, in
defiance of Australian predictions and after his splendid batting
performance in the first at Old Trafford. In the long term, though, I favour
one of the thoughtful breed of captains - like Ray Illingworth or Fletcher -
skilled at getting the most out of the least. I could be wrong, but my
instinct inclines towards someone like Yorkshire's Martyn Moxon rather than,
say, the hard-hitting, straightforward Hugh Morris, skipper of Glamorgan.
Interesting candidates will be easier to assess at the end of the season.
Rather the selectors than me.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Sport: Europe's unsung women drivers - Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS MATYSZCZYK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'LET'S face it,' a sports agent once told me. 'Women's sport is about sex
first, performance second.'
In European golf, particularly in Britain, the prejudices are nursery school
and public school in equal measure, this means three supremely talented
players are almost unknown. Jack Nicklaus could be fat and famous. But Helen
Alfredsson, Laura Davies and Trish Johnson need to play like Hogan and look
like Madonna. Is the deft and devious mind of an agent truly unable to sell
mere skill and personality? Will his next-of-kin, the sponsor, really not
buy it?
When it comes to Alfie, Laura and Trish, perhaps personality is a polite way
of putting it. Each is blessed with charm, tenacity and vulnerability, but
they are all highly competitive and live as fiercely as they play.
The facts that these three Europeans (who play this weekend at the BMW
European Masters at Golf du Bercuit, just outside Brussels) are all in the
US LPGA Tour top ten and all played in Europe's drubbing of the crabby,
ungracious Americans in last year's Solheim Cup is of interest only to a
faithful handful.
Alfredsson, 28, spent her youth in stilettos as often as spikes. She was a
catwalk model in Paris. But she gave that up: 'It was a meat market. It was
just make-up, calories and drugs. And I got out of it fast. Now I wear long
shorts to hide my cellulite.'
She trained in Sweden's elite golfing academy, before going to college in
San Diego. There she was twice banished from the golf team and went off with
the soccer coach, Leo Cuellar. Cuellar, a former Mexican footballer, is now
her fiance. 'We play many games together, but whether it's backgammon or
cards, we have to beat the hell out of each other,' she says.
To Alfredsson quitting is anathema, tantrums occasional. Spectators like her
tantrums. They can be louder and more richly worded than many of Lenny
Bruce's best performances. Last year she was America's rookie of the year.
This year, she has already won their first major, the Nabisco Dinah Shore.
Davies has become accepted in British sporting circles less because she won
the British and US Opens of 1986 and 1987 respectively than because she is
far more knowledgeable than most of the men on the television quiz A
Question of Sport.
Her golf game is built on instinct and gargantuan power. And no coach. She
continues to support the European circuit in spite of its disastrous
management history. During tournaments she organises football and cricket
matches. And plays in them. (You can just imagine Nick Faldo doing that.
What would his personal fitness trainer say?) She is a mediocre spin bowler,
a sterling bat and a bit like Niall Quinn, the gangling Irish striker
She says: 'I like a gamble. I like driving cars too fast. I love sport. Any
sport.'
Talk to her about football, for example, and you get neither ignorance nor
platitudes. Rather: 'Graham Taylor is a prat. I lost all respect for him
when he dropped Chris Waddle. And you can quote me.' This sort of
outspokeness gives agents hypertension.
Johnson, Davies' 27-year-old partner in cricket and crime on tour, finally
found recognition this year by winning two consecutive US tournament. Her
long game is less spectacular than either Davies' and Alfredsson's, but from
80 yards or less she is deadly. At last year's European Masters she was
unwise enough to have me caddy for her, when her regular valet was stranded
in the US. Her concentration, dedication and shot-making are on a par with,
say, Vijay Singh on the men's tour. But I bet Vijay does not drive to the
course like Trish. She became intolerant of Belgian traffic and every
morning for six days insisted on driving the wrong side of the road. This
was not a little bit of overtaking. This was stretches of up to a kilometre
at 120km an hour.
Johnson, Davies and Alfredsson, like to live a little. They are throwbacks
to the days before golfers played to earn rather than to win. They play for
love first, money second. They play for a win, not a place. A game populated
by a thousand clones of Scott Simpson ought to be grateful.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Fashion: Suit yourself for summer / A look at the styles and
fabrics which look chic and cool on the hottest days
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN ENGLAND the summer suit is still a rarity. The Englishman views it as a
purely practical necessity rather than an item to be enjoyed.
Men should learn to enjoy wearing suits; they are, after all, the foundation
of men's fashion. Over the past few decades the 'designer suit' has been
growing in status, gaining more cache than its bespoke relation and reaching
a high-point in the 1980s. Style and taste came to be seen as something you
could purchase along with everything else - and there is nothing wrong with
that. In many ways it has proved a boon to tailors who are now visited by
men who have some idea as to what they want and require in a suit.
If you buy 'off the peg' you get a ready-made style. When you visit a tailor
he works with you to interpret your ideas and to advise and guide you
through the complexities of detailing and fashion. One of the great
advantages of having a suit made is the large selection of cloth to choose
from.
Richard James delights in using wonderful fabrics - 'all British,' he will
proudly tell you. He has made a classic suit in denim, that most classless
of fabrics, at the made to measure price of Pounds 750, plus VAT.
He excels not only in choice of fabric but also in use of colour, which is
hardly surprising since he trained as an artist.
Unlike Richard James, Mark Powell does not have a Savile Row address, his
studio is up several flights of stairs in the heart of Soho. Do not be put
off by the exterior for once inside you will find one of the most
imaginative and skilled tailors in London. He will look after his clients'
needs but also offers a strong personal signature so whatever suit you
choose it will never be described as boring.
You could pick a suit in navy or grey wool for the office or in lightweight
flannel to punt past the Stewards' Enclosure at Henley.
His tailoring is quintessentially English in cut and cloth, acknowledging
classical tailoring skills but not being constrained by them. He has also
developed a washable suit made of treated linen or cotton which is perfect
for the man who travels a great deal. A two-piece starts at Pounds 450 and
will take two to three weeks to make. If you feel uncomfortable visiting
London's Bohemia then he will visit you at your office bringing with him
fabric books, his portfolio and his charm.
Most men wear woollen suits made from cloth weighing 11 ounces which can,
with the addition and subtraction of layers be worn throughout the year. For
really lightweight suits, suitable for summer wear, 9oz or 10oz is
preferable.
Linen is a wonderful fabric but because it creases it is not really suitable
for work, however it is perfect when worn in a casual manner and, like any
summer suit need not always be worn with a shirt and tie. They can be
replaced by T-shirts, sweaters in fine cotton, or linen and waistcoats.
Espadrilles or plimsolls taking the place of brogues to give a louche,
between-the-wars, Riviera look.
The Italians have always been expert in the casual wearing of suits. Giorgio
Armani is a past master at this look. His Emporio collection not only offers
suits ideal for the office but also for summer holidays. His suits have all
the right fashion details and remain classics.
Another designer well worth looking at is Romeo Gigli, who creates 'easy
dressing' suits in 100 per cent linen, and in a linen/Lycra mix which does
not crease. He also uses a fine summerweight wool and he chooses colours
beautifully to complement his unstructured look. Linen suits can be bought
as separates (jackets about Pounds 420, trousers, Pounds 150), the wool ones
as a suit (from Pounds 600) and the peau de peche versions are also sold
separately (jackets, Pounds 370, trousers Pounds 150). The range can be seen
at the recently opened shop in South Molton Street, London, W1.
Romeo Gigli, it seems, is interested in promoting 'the sensitivity of a
man.' In England it is Paul Smith who is sensitive to customers' needs. He
has helped to keep alive the suit as an alternative to the jacket and
trouser. The Floral Street shop is the perfect place to start your search
for the summer suit and there are plenty of accessories, such as v-neck
cotton slipovers, as well.
Whether you choose designer or bespoke, choose wisely. Do not be frightened
of asking for advice. In England there is a short summer and the days when
you need a real summer suit are few so the one you choose should be one you
will really enjoy wearing for years to come. Above all, remember, not to dry
clean your suit after just a few outings - it will knock the life out of it.
Simply air the suit on a clothes line.

SOME OF YOU may be wondering how the Browns/FT fashion workshops went. Well,
they seemed to be a huge success. In the end we held two as the first was
over-subscribed by the first post. For me it was lovely to meet so many
readers - and it was particularly rewarding that so many came from outside
London. Everybody I spoke to enjoyed seeing what some of our designers are
up to, to see just how a fine jacket can be made to work for its price-tag
and how a suit can be worn in many different moods. It was extraordinary to
hear so many lovely women say that they felt so diffident about their
wardrobes, but it was good to feel that we gave them the confidence to
experiment. The clothes were shown on the Browns' staff who, like women
everywhere, came short and tall, skinny and Junoesque - but all looked
terrific. This, we hope, is what the evening did - encouraged every woman
there to find her own style and to realise that perfect bodies exist only in
glossy magazines. The rest of us can look good, too. We may do it again this
autumn - and possibly something for the chaps - so watch this space.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Fashion: Let's hear it for hats - Jane Mulvagh shuns shades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUNGLASSES are a sure sign that the temperature and human alienation are
soaring. Armies of eyeless aliens hidden behind shatter-proof, glare-proof
and people-proof glass suddenly hit the city streets.
Do you feel cut off from human response when struggling to communicate with
someone whose eyes, the window to the soul, are curtained from you? Have
they noticed you? Are they listening? Are you boring them? Have they lost
their heart to you? Have they a heart at all?
Sunglasses simply strike me as bad manners. So, why not headwear instead?
After all, England is the home of the hat.
You might argue that sunglasses are practical and glamorous. Well, not
entirely. How many pairs have you lost? And is it really so glamorous to
look like everyone else, a pale imitation of a Hollywood star feigning
privacy behind such an attention-seeking fashion statement? Let's bring a
human face back to fashion and top it with a titfer.
Trimmed or untrimmed, the bigger the hat, the better. But you have to be shy
to wear one.
Shy? Let Philip Treacy, a fashionable London milliner, explain: 'Lots of my
customers wear a hat if they are going to a big event and they feel nervous.
Yet nobody would know they were shy as they have this aesthetically pleasing
thing attached to them.'
A hat can not only counter shyness but can do wonders for a poor complexion.
We have all suffered days when even a trowel's worth of make-up fails to
cover a bad skin. Try a shading and disguising hat instead and if things are
really bad, a polka dot veil should do the trick]
A hat can replace an umbrella and you are far less likely to leave it
behind. The Archbishop of Canterbury found his hat a useful storage spot
when crowning George IV in 1821. When the monarch staggered up the aisle
weighed down by his heavily-emdroidered mantle on that steaming June day, he
had used more than 20 silk handkerchiefs to mop his royal brow. He handed
the sodden mass to the Archbishop who promptly popped them under his mitre.
Hats can be economical. One smart dress or suit can be transformed by using
a variety of hats.
The hat has had a hard time ever since the majority of children stopped
wearing them to school. The 1960s generation dropped them in favour of
hair-dos. Now, in typical defiance of their parents, today's young love
hats. In America they are the rage. Saks on Fifth Avenue, New York, has
recorded a 300 per cent increase in millinery sales during the past year.

FT  26 JUN 93 / How To Spend It: The top tables
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYBODY in London this weekend and with even the smallest interest in
wining, dining and setting a fine table should head for The House &amp; Garden
Eating In Show. It runs until tomorrow evening (10 am to 6pm today, 10 am to
4.30 pm on Sunday) and there is so much going on I hardly know where to
start.
There will be wine tastings, table settings and complete kitchens as well as
demonstrations by some of our most famous cooks - Michel Roux (Cooking For
Your Pleasure), Antonio Carluccio (A Passion for Pasta), Anthony
Worrall-Thompson (Bistro Cooking at Home), Bruno Loubet (New Season's
Vegetables) and more. There will, of course, be masses to eat - the catering
is being run by Anton Mosimann and all around will be mouth-watering
temptations of every kind.
Those who have always wanted a more dashing sort of table will be inspired
by settings by Garrards, Liberty of Regent Street, Wedgwood, Tricia Guild
and Zandra Rhodes's own idiosyncratic approach to the art of the table,
photographed here left.
Zandra has come up with a rich, exotic table setting, part modern, part
ancient, part British, part foreign. The table cloth is her own design. The
cutlery is Acripole Dore (Pounds 850 for a 44-piece canteen) from Harrods,
but rumour has it that it will be reduced in the forthcoming sale. The
quirky bowls and setting plates are by Carol McNichol, one of our leading
ceramicists, and cost Pounds 42 each for the bowls, Pounds 60 for the
plates.
The flowers are by Paula Pryke of 20, Penton Street, Islington, London N1
(tel: 071-873-7336) while the four-tiered tulip vase is 18th century and
costs Pounds 800; similar versions can be ordered through Zandra Rhodes'
shop at 85, Hammersmith Road, London W6. The printed silk cushions are all
made by Zandra Rhodes - to order - at Pounds 150 each. The little figurines
are by Albany China.
The show is on at The Business Design Centre, Upper Street, Islington,
London N1. Tickets cost Pounds 9 and can be bought at the door or by ringing
the ticket hotline, 071-288-6888.

FT  26 JUN 93 / How To Spend It: Nineties-style? It's all so simple, really
 -Lucia van der Post picks up some useful tips on making the modern home a
model of clean, uncluttered chic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE HAVE all been told many times that nineties-style is simple style.
Conventional wisdom has it that overnight the bad old sumptuous ways became
demode and the truly chic household was suddenly transformed into a model of
pared-down simplicity. Reality, of course, is different. The words may be
easy to say, realising it is much less easy to bring off . . . particularly
for those whose houses are still laden with the legacies of 1980s chic.
There are many, though, for whom the new wisdom chimes with a change in the
inner psychology, who find their natural tastes and inclinations veering
towards a more pared-down way of life, who feel an instinctive rebellion
against the over-blown excesses of the eighties and who long to translate
this into a cleaner, fresher-looking home. What they need is a 1990s version
of Mrs Beeton, a kind of comprehensive encyclopaedia or guide-book to the
new life-style. Needless to say, where there is a gap, something usually
fills it and this week sees the launch of . . . guess what? . . . a primer
on simple chic.
Chic Simple* is a cross between a visual record, a sourcebook and an
evangelical tome. It goes in for lots of inspiring photographs and plenty of
uplifting aphorisms, all homing in on the wondrous benefits of simplicity.
Anybody who is anybody in design circles has a go. Here, for instance, we
have Andree Putman, that meteor of the French design scene who designed
offices for Jack Lang, the French Minister of Culture, as well as smart
boutiques in almost every capital of the world. 'Unless you have a feeling
for that secret knowledge that modest things can be more beautiful than
anything expensive, you will never have style.' Then, on comfort: 'Of
course, I love seven pillows behind me, but physical comfort is never the
first thing. I prefer spiritual comfort, by which I mean space, light
(natural, as well as artificial), contrast of textures, and pure lines. I
never look for literal comfort, but for something that allows my mind to
rest.'
Then we have Sir Terence Conran: 'I firmly believe that plain, simple things
are superior to flashy, complicated ones. Something that is simple and
satisfying is a greater achievement than something fussy. Good objects are
designed with honesty, integrity, simplicity, and guts. A plain glass milk
bottle can ultimately be more impressive than an intricate silver gilt
pitcher.'
If these are the sort of sentiments that you feel comfortable with then Chic
Simple has a lot to offer. It presents a powerful visual argument for
restraint, quality and purity - most floors are wooden, most walls white or
cream, objects are functional, streamlined and - it goes almost without
saying - efficiently designed.
Simple, often neglected things, are photographed in a way that makes one
look at them properly and see their beauty - a battered table (Candice
Bergen is quoted as saying 'I pay a fortune for these battered tables, and
my husband says, 'Aren't you going to paint them?' And I say, 'You don't
understand the concept here','), a collection of some everyday kitchen
utensils, an old cupboard, a couple of wooden chairs - 'A chair is a very
difficult object to design,' says Mies van der Rohe. 'A skyscraper is almost
easier, that is why Chippendale is famous.'
If a consensus does emerge it is probably best summed up by Le Corbusier -
'Space and light and order. These are the things men need just as much as
they need bread or a place to sleep.'
It is probably evident by now that this is almost a compendium of pictures,
philosophies, poetry, attitudes, all adding up to a package of considerable
charm. It is a book, above all, to dip into but it is also a reference book,
for the practical bit comes last - at the back is a useful list of sources
for the ingredients that make up the simple life. From the US to England,
France, Australia and Japan there are the suppliers of highly functional
lighting, of the best modern furniture, of the rugs and taps and kitchens.
The book itself can be bought from Muji branches at 26, Great Marlborough
Street, London W1, 39 Shelton Street, London WC2 and 63-67, Queen Street,
Glasgow. Muji, regular readers may remember, is the Japanese company
dedicated to pursuing the anti-label way of life, and which will be filling
its windows with photographs of the Muji way to nineties living. The book is
also available in branches of Waterstone's bookshops.
More visual inspiration, though of a much more vibrant nature, can be found
in Tricia Guild's Design and Detail: The Practical Guide to Styling a
House*. Here we have Tricia Guild's sure and individual way with colour,
though stronger and more primary than in the floral days of old. If you have
ever been hesitant about how to hang your pictures, how to make flowers look
more enticing than a conventional florist's offering, how to present food so
that it looks dramatic and appetising, here is your pictorial guide. Filled
with ravishing full-colour pictures it would be a dull person indeed who did
not come away with a few ideas on how to update their rooms.
Finally, The Reject Shop chain of stores has a small, simple mail order
catalogue from which you can order a few of life's necessities - plain as
plain sofas, straightforward chests of drawers, slatted folding chairs and a
simple series of dining tables. The lines are clean and pleasing, the prices
good. Find the catalogue at any one of The Reject Shop's many branches or
telephone 071-736-7474 for a free copy.
*Chic Simple is published by Thames &amp; Hudson, Pounds 12.95. Design and
Detail by Tricia Guild is published by Conran Octopus, Pounds 12.99.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Food and Drink: How the Raj curried favour - Books for Cooks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By K NATWAR-SINGH and NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RAJ AT TABLE: A CULINARY HISTORY OF THE BRITISH IN INDIA by David Burton
Faber, Pounds 14.99, 240 pages
FOODS FROM FRANCE by Quentin Crewe Ebury Press, Pounds 15.99, 160 pages
PASSION FOR PASTA by Antonio Carluccio BBC Books, Pounds 15.99, 192 pages
THIS IS the Raj seen through the kitchen door. But this entertaining, and at
times very amusing, book is not just for cooks, in spite of its 60 exotic
and saliva-producing recipes.
Burton, a New Zealander, has taken pains to discover and share with us his
discovery of the enchantments and chaos of colonial and Raj food and cooking
habits. So, this is also an excellent and authentic contribution to the
social history of the era.
The Raj left several enduring legacies: parliamentary democracy, a legal
system, health services, cricket, and the English language. But the reverse
traffic was not very significant. It made no widespread or fundamental
impact on British social and political institutions.
Today, the Indians are, with total British collaboration, practising a
benign form of curried kebab imperialism in reverse. Indian cuisine,
sneered-at by pukka sahibs and memsahibs of the raj, proliferates in the UK
as a welcome aspect of contemporary British life.
Yet, it took the British a long time to learn there was more to Indian
cuisine than kedgeree, curry powder and mulligatawny soup. (Mulligatawny is
anglicised corruption of the Tamil words milagu and tanni, meaning pepper
water). Indeed, this change has come about only in recent years.
Social life, eating and cooking habits underwent several transformations
during the 300 years the British ruled India. In the 17th and 18th
centuries, expatriate men were content to live like the Indians and ate
betel nut, smoked the hukka (hubble-bubble) and kept local mistresses.
I learnt a thing or two from Burton. Up to the early 17th century, for
instance, he tells us: 'In England, forks were still not considered proper
eating utensils for a gentleman of the time, and the English maintained the
medieval custom of scooping food to their mouths with bread sops which they
held in their hand - an identical practice to the Indians, both Muslims and
Hindus.'
At the same time, Burton deflated my gastronomical ego by declaring that
chillies, potatoes and tomatoes - much-used ingredients of Indian cuisine -
did not originate from India. They came from South America through Portugal,
he says. Another illusion gone.
Social life in British India was governed by a leisurely pace. Burra Khanas
 -the grand feast - was a common feature. It took time to organise and, once
launched, went on until the early hours. Later the British lapsed into the
dreadful habit of dressing for dinner, even in the summer months.
Eccentricity was an accepted part of imperial life: indeed, Noel Coward's
well-known doggerel about 'Mad (dogs and) Englishmen' is not all that far
off the mark. Some of them did the oddest things. The Rajwallahs made a
fetish over the order of precedence at gubernatorial banquets, and Burton
relates a topping anecdote.
One governor found himself sitting between the wives of recently-knighted
husbands. Each thought herself superior to the other. Finally, the one
sitting on the left could not restrain herself. 'I suppose, in a place of
this size, it is difficult to know sometimes just how to place people at
table,' she said.
She met her match in the governor, who replied, coolly: 'Not at all. You
see, the people who matter do not mind, and the people who do don't matter.'
                           *      *      *
THE IDEA for Foods from France is deceptively simple. Take 18 foods for
which French regions are famous, such as oysters from Brittany, foie gras
from Gers, truffles from Drome, chickens from Bresse and wild mushrooms from
the Dordogne. Throw in two distinctive drinks, Sancerre and Armagnac, and
track down the finest producers of each of them.
But in the hands of Quentin Crewe and photographer John Brunton, this simple
tour becomes a complex affair, revealing much that is distinctive with the
world of French gastronomy.
Take their visit to La Dombes, an area north-east of Lyon where 1,000 lakes
supply the nation's finest frogs. The first fisherman to whom they were
directed would not meet them in case their questions aroused the suspicions
of the taxman. Then, they were told that local restaurants served only frogs
imported from Albania or Greece.
Finally, with the help of Philippe Jousse - the chef now in charge at Alain
Chapel's renowned restaurant at Mionnay - they tracked down Rene Maisson,
who catches frogs with rod and line for a living.
The manner in which Crewe and Brunton stumble across their reclusive
producers is one of the book's charms. En route, two further aspects of
French haute cuisine become obvious.
One is that, however rich the ingredients of French cuisine, the individuals
producing them struggle perpetually to make a good living. Then, by a clever
juxtaposition of recipes using these ingredients, the book shows how many
top chefs depend on these individuals if they want to continue to produce
food that is distinctive and representative of its terroir.
There is a bitter finale, though. While the book celebrates the work of
these producers, it also depicts them as one of Europe's vanishing breeds,
trapped between EC legislation which affects how they produce and increased
pollution which is reducing how much they can produce. They need a book like
this to highlight their plight.
Meanwhile, interested cooks will thoroughly enjoy the interviews, recipes
and photography.
FEW FOOD books manage to convey the same enthusiasm on the front cover as
that of their contents, but Carluccio's Passion for Pasta is an exception.
It shows the author tucking in to a Parmesan cheese stuffed with taglierini,
tomatoes and basil. Good culinary advice is dispensed and unusual recipes -
such as macaroni with sardines or agnolotti with ricotta and truffle - are
explained concisely.

<TEXT>
A GASTRONOMIC highlight of a visit to Texas two years ago was dinner in the
restaurant at The Mansion on Turtle Creek, Dallas, writes Lucia van der
Post. It was my first visit to Big Bend country. I knew nothing about
south-west cuisine; and as for Dean Fearing, The Mansion's celebrated chef,
all I saw was a long-haired young blond who looked more like a rock
musician.
Despite the alluring menu, jet lag meant that I lacked appetite; but Fearing
said he would just bring us little tasters of his favourite things.
Delectable titbits followed thick and fast: a soft-shell crab sauced subtly;
a filled taco spiced with a vigorous salsa; tortilla salad with little corn
fritter; wood-grilled snapper on corn puree. I have forgotten most of the
details but well remember the delight.
The good news is that Fearing is coming to London's Lanesborough Hotel to
cook for a week from July 2-9.
In America, he is already the kind of big-name chef that Raymond Blanc and
Marco-Pierre White are in Britain. His special accomplishment is to weave
together the ingredients and techniques of Asian, Mexican and southern US
cooking. The result is spicy, robust and filled with earthy flavours - yet
subtle, too.
His dishes at the Lanesborough will include warm lobster taco with yellow
tomato salsa and jicama salad; wood-grilled red snapper on corn puree with
three sauces (black bean, papaya and red chilli); and south-west applejack
cheese crumb tart.
The dining room and conservatory will provide set-price menus for lunch and
dinner: Pounds 20.50 for lunch in the conservatory and Pounds 24.50 in the
dining room, while dinner will be Pounds 26.50 and Pounds 29.50
respectively. An American Independence Day brunch in the conservatory on
Sunday, July 4, will be Pounds 24.50.
The first 20 Weekend FT readers to book for either lunch or dinner
(mentioning the Weekend FT) will get a complimentary bottle of either
Jordan's Chardonnay or Jordan's Cabernet Sauvignon. Tel. 071-259 5599 for
reservations.
                        *      *      *
Two new names for those in north London fond of good food, writes Nicholas
Lander. Beth's is where Keats restaurant used to be at 3a Downshire Hill,
NW3 (071-435 3544), with Beth Coventry as head chef. Open seven days a week.
More unusual is the first-class traitteur/delicatessen Pagnol, opened
recently at 170 Regent's Park Road, N1 (071-586 6988). Open Tues-Fri 10-8,
Sat 10-6.
                        *      *      *
The National Organic Food and Wine Fair takes place at Ryton Organic
Gardens, Ryton-on-Dunsmore, Coventry (0203-303 517) on Friday afternoon,
July 9, and all day Saturday, July 10. Tickets Pounds 5 on the day, Pounds 4
in advance.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Drink: Belgian brews with body and soul
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
'I say Weihenstephan.'
'And I want Pilsener.'
SO SAY two of the Prussian wedding guests in Theodor Fontane's 1897 novel
Der Stechlin. By this time, Berlin and Prussia had fallen to a two-pronged
beer attack from Bavaria and Bohemia.
Just like the rest of Europe, Berliners once contented themselves with the
reddish-brown beers and ales brewed locally; in this case, those of Bernau
and Werder, towns to the east and west of the capital. The first Pilsen
beers arrived with the railway in the 1850s; the Bavarians came a little
later.
As the century went on, Berliners achieved a small compromise by hopping
these new, yellow beers a little more to the north German taste. The result
was the Berliner Molle. South Germany resisted more manfully, but even
Bavaria has lost ground to the Bohemians this century.
Bavarian beer originally was a dark brown lager but, in the past 30 years,
the taste has gone over to light, bright beers; only the older generation of
Muncheners have clung to their traditional Dunkelbier. By the end of the
century, Pilsener is likely to have won over an even greater chunk of the
Bavarian population.
The Bohemian influence has spread to the beers of Alsace, Spain, Portugal,
Mexico, Jamaica and the United States: all are, to some extent, inspired by
the soft-water, bottom-fermented, golden-hued beers of Pilsen.
Since the 1960s, the same process has hit Britain. Bass-Charrington says
'lager' accounts for 80 per cent of its sales - even though the mainstay is
Carling Black Label, a rather bitter lager closer to the north German type.
Of all the countries to have kept faith with their brewing traditions,
Belgium excites the most interest from enthusiasts. This is as it should be,
for it has more different styles of beer than anywhere else.
Take, for example, the great Trappist beers made only in five Belgian
monasteries, and one across the border in Holland; dark, complex brews all.
'Abbey' beers often are made in the same style but they are produced 'under
license' by commercial breweries.
Lambic and Gueuze both are wheat beers which have undergone spontaneous
fermentation and maturation in casks. Gueuze goes a stage further and is
fermented once again in bottle, like champagne. Some Lambic is flavoured
with cherries or raspberries, the fruit being poured directly into the casks
to set off a second fermentation. The result is fruity, certainly, but
completely dry.
In Brabant, there are white beers which are made mainly from wheat, like a
German Weizen. The difference is that the Belgians add aromatics, such as
coriander and orange peel, then ferment the beers a second time in bottle.
The result is a brew like Hoegaarden: lemony in colour with a slight yeast
haze and a tangy, refreshing, citric character. Hoegaarden promises to be
more readily available in Britain nowthat the main importer, Whitbread, has
decided to release it through a number of up-market pubs.
In west Flanders there are 'red' beers, like those of the Rodenbach brewery
which spend up to two years maturing in wooden vats; this gives them a
strangely vinous quality. Indeed, in many ways Belgium produces the beers
which come closest to the wine-lover's ideal. Michael Jackson in his book
The Great Beers of Belgium, persists in comparing the beers to wines,
perhaps because these are brews designed for long meditation.
With the exception of Whitbread, the brewers have been predictably slow in
making Belgian bottled beers available to the on-trade. Lured into a pub the
other day during the brief heat-wave, I was thwarted completely in my
attempts to find a decent, bottle-conditioned brew.
In the end, I had to make do with a bottle of Spanish San Miguel: a
Pilsener-style beer which proved just one more example of the colonising
zeal of the Bohemians.
Stockists of Belgian bottled beers include: the Beer Shop, 8 Pitfield
Street, London NI (071-739 3701); Grogblossom and branches, 66 Notting Hill
Gate, London WII (071-792 3834); the Beer Cellar, Thame, Oxfordshire
(0844-260 500); and the York Beer Shop, 28 Sandringham Street, Fishergate,
York (0904-647 136). All do mail-order sales.
A restaurant called Belgo at 72 Chalk Farm Road, London, NWI (071-267 2179),
has a wonderful selection of bottled Belgian beers - and food to go with
them.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Cookery: Gorgeous gooseberries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANANAS and canned pineapple are to blame. It was shiploads of these
'exotics' that put paid, early in the 1900s, to what had been a thriving
gooseberry appreciation society.
In 1829, the Gooseberry Growers' Register recorded 722 different varieties
grown in Britain. Today, it is rare to find more than one sort on sale,
wherever you look - and that is likely to be an anonymous culinary variety
as green as grass, hard as hail and picked horribly immature.
Fortunately, all is not lost. The scene might be dire in the shops but
treasure trove is to be found at Brogdale,* the Kentish home of the national
fruit collections where more than 100 varieties of gooseberry are grown. My
visit there was a revelation. I always knew I liked gooseberries, but it was
not until Brogdale's Dr Joan Morgan opened my eyes (and my mouth) to the
choice available that I realised just how splendid and richly varied this
fruit can be.
Gooseberry colours run the whole gamut of reds, from pink champagne through
claret to nearly black. There are shades of amber and gold, palest jade and
almost white. The fruit can be as small as a cultivated blueberry or as big
as a gobstopper, perfectly round or elongated. A few types bristle with
designer stubble, some are mildly hirsute, and others are as bald as a
baby's pate.
The tastes of the best gooseberries are rich and full, sometimes
honey-sweet, winey, complex and lingering. And the names of them roll off
the tongue like a litany: Snowdrop, White Champagne, Golden Gem, Hero of the
Nile, Lancer, Leveller (one of the best golden orbs), Pitmarston's
Greengage, Langley's Gage (which hangs well on the bush and so becomes very
sugary), Halmon's Dumpling, Cope's Jolly Butcher, Pendleton's Bullock's
Hearts, Slaughterman (there are a lot of bloodthirsty names among the reds),
and Whinham's Industry (perhaps my favourite).
Gorging on the real thing like these, ripened properly and picked freshly,
whetted my appetite to serve a dessert of gooseberries - by which I mean
three or four choice varieties, each displayed in its own basket or bowl, to
be topped and tailed at table and popped into your mouth, like sweets, at
the end of dinner. It might be a little much to dunk them in cream as well,
but a few crisp little biscuits on the side do not go amiss - say, almond
tuiles, macaroons or petticoat tails.
Such a dessert is fresh, healthy, and very easy for the cook. But, of
course, it all depends on having access to tip-top gooseberries.
Next weekend, on July 3 and 4, Brogdale is holding a summer fruit festival
with guided tours, displays, consultations with fruit experts and tastings
of many summer fruits - strawberries, raspberries, cherries and currants as
well as gooseberries. Visitors can, throughout the fruiting season, buy
punnets of choice varieties to take home.
Dessert gooseberries are not only rarer than culinary varieties but are
doubly useful. They can be cooked as well as eaten raw; and just as dessert
apples often make better puddings than cooking apples, so dessert
gooseberries make excellent hot puddings on so-called summer days chilly
enough to bring you out in goose pimples.
The hot fruit salad in Elizabeth David's Summer Cooking is a lovely choice
of gooseberry recipe for such days. It has, as she puts it, 'all the flavour
and scent of a warm summer fruit garden.'
Stew gently without water 1 lb topped and tailed red gooseberries and 1/4 lb
red currants sprinkled with a little sugar. After five minutes, add  1/2 lb
raspberries and cook for just two minutes more. Serve very hot with thick,
fresh cream.
For those who have access only to the little green gooseberries of commerce,
I suggest my own adaptation of a classic apple pudding.
LITTLE GOOSEBERRY CHARLOTTES (serves 8-10)
This seems equally at home for Sunday lunch or a dinner party. Serve it on
its own, handing round a bowl of cream whipped with a little elderflower
syrup for those who want it. For a party, each castle-like pudding can be
served surrounded by its own moat of pouring cream and crowned with florets
of elderflower (if still in blossom) or a shake of caster sugar.
Ingredients: 2 1/4 lb green gooseberries, topped and tailed; 2-3 elderflower
blossoms or 3-4 tablespoons elderflower syrup; 4-6 oz caster sugar; 2 oz
flaked almonds, coarsely ground in a coffee mill or food processor; a loaf
of good white bread; about 8 oz butter.
Method: Moisten a large, heavy-based pan with a couple of tablespoons of
water. Add the gooseberries and cook very gently, with the blossoms buried
among them if available, or add the elderflower syrup to the pan when the
gooseberries have begun to pop and yield their juices.
When the berries are soft, crush them into the pan with a potato masher to
make a not-too-smooth puree. Add 4-6 oz sugar (the smaller amount if
elderflower syrup was used) and continue cooking over a very low flame for
several minutes until excess moisture is driven off, leaving a thick and
intensely-flavoured pulp.
The mixture will spit and plop as it cooks and will need frequent stirring
to prevent catching and burning. Use a long-handled wooden spoon and protect
your hand with an oven glove.
Set the pan aside, uncovered, so evaporation continues as the mixture cools.
Then, stiffen the fruit by stirring in the freshly ground almonds.
Slice the bread thinly and cut out rounds to fit the bases of 10 cocotte
dishes or dariole moulds of about 5 fl oz capacity. Fry the rounds in a
little butter until crisp and golden brown and put them into the moulds.
Melt more butter in the frying pan, dip pieces of bread into it to moisten
them on both sides, and use them to line the sides of the moulds. The fit
should be as neat and as tight as a jigsaw.
Spoon the cold gooseberry pulp into the bread-lined moulds, packing it down
firmly. Cover with lids of bread, again dipped in melted butter to moisten
them, and place the little puddings on a baking tray. Bake for 30 minutes at
425'F/220'C (gas mark 7) until the filling is hot and the bread is crisp.
Let the charlottes settle for 5-10 minutes after they emerge from the oven.
Then, run a knife round the inside edge of each mould and invert the
puddings on to warmed plates for serving.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Gardening: When the garden goes to pot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLOWER beds are still ahead of themselves: for the rest of the year, I am
pinning my garden's hopes on pots. In a pot, you can plant, plant late,
re-plant, or move flowers to and fro wherever they are needed. You can sink
potted lilies into borders and remove them, substituting Michaelmas daisies
for a later season. When the roses have already peaked and the agapanthus
are in bud late in June, half a dozen strategic flower pots lift the garden
out of premature death. But they are best used with an art which we are
still exploring.
For years, I thought in terms of one or two varieties only, segregated pot
by pot: a mimulus in one, a pelargonium in another, and envy for the very
dark purple strain of petunias which seemed to be grown only in
Sissinghurst's front courtyard. Segregation is still the rule if you want to
grow shrubs or train climbers in a single pot. Many good roses will flourish
in confinement, as you can infer from Peter Beales' fine book, Classic
Roses, where they are marked with a symbolic P. Probably, we should all grow
roses more often in pots, but the excitement has shifted elsewhere.
A few brave spirits had always experimented, especially in great gardens
like Powis Castle or Kiftsgate Court where the large pots housed mounds of
mixed flower and foliage. In the 1980s, the art became bolder, propelled by
amateurs but not by horticulturalists, whose handbooks still ignore the
possibilities. Like others on the circuit, I learned most from Mrs Merton of
The Old Rectory, Burghfield, near Reading. She massed dozens of different
varieties into 27-inch pots, broke the rules triumphantly - and earned a
colour photograph in the FT for June 1990.
I return to the subject because we all have more experience now. We also
have another book on the subject.
Rupert Golby is an able garden-planter in the younger generation and his
Container Garden (Headline, Pounds 16.99) has just appeared, illustrating 16
garden schemes for pots. The very best part is the final section where he
prints a key to the plantings shown in each of the photographs.
Some of his sentences read like captions for postcards to which I find
myself putting an image. 'In summer, the garden at the Old Rectory has
subtle hints of Mrs Huntington's past . . . ' and 'Mike was interested to
discover which of several blue daisy flowers would perform best in the
tazzas.'
The most important section for us all, though, is a two-page interview with
Susan Dickinson, who stands in the top flight of Britain's head gardeners.
Service at Sissinghurst runs in her past, together with Hatfield and a long
duet with Mrs Merton in which the two of them brought pot-planting to a new
extravagance. She has now been signed up by Jacob Rothschild, although this
book is rather coy about this unquestionable acquisition.
In his grand garden plans, pots are still a priority and she has lost none
of the old panache. I find that she agrees on the ignored secret of success:
it relies on heavy feeding. She feeds the Rothschild daturas every day with
a high-liquid nitrogen fertiliser: in dry weather, she also waters them
three times a day, noting that it reduces the risk of red spider ravages.
She even feeds the big-leaved sparmannia in a similar way although I have
always found that it grows very freely, turning yellow - perhaps from
starvation - on the lower branches. In 1992, she also fed all the petunias,
heliotropes and lemon verbenas with a high nitrogen fertiliser once a week:
'They responded by producing deep green leaves and flowering madly until
mid-October.' Everything else is fed on a high potash feed and the results
confirm my own beliefs.
The new style is to over-plant wildly in pots between 2ft-2 1/2 ft wide.
Begin by placing a tall plant in the centre and then cram in more
softly-coloured summer perennials than others would believe possible. It
works like a dream if you follow the Dickinson principle and use
concentrated fertilisers until mid-September.
I have heard people say that designer-gardening in pots is very expensive
and that it is an endless nuisance. On both points, I disagree, but readers
of Golby's book may not immediately see why. He lists good sources for
hand-made pots, but I hope that this high standard will not deter you from
diving down-market.
Last year, I made up the numbers with several Far Eastern imports, on sale
for less than Pounds 10 each at the Hampton Court flower show. I have just
found some thin 'terracottas,' nearly 2 ft wide, selling at Pounds 6 each in
the local garden centre. They will probably split in a very hard winter but,
at that price, who cares?
Golby reiterates a tip which I, too, find useful for toning down the
brightness of the cheapest type of pottery. Wet the surface; rub it with dry
garden lime; spray it lightly with water again and, after several attempts,
it will lose the colour of a pot on a patio on the Costa Brava.
As for the bother, watering is the worst of it. Here, Golby recommends
lining each pot with a polythene bag to limit loss of water through its
walls. He does not mention a trick which saved me even more trouble last
year. When preparing the soil, mix in some water-retaining crystals,
following the instructions about watering them first. The most
widely-marketed is Swel Gel, which is satisfactory if you need to buy only
in small quantities. It swells into long-lasting lumps of jelly and cuts
down the watering of flower pots by as much as a half. You can even go away
for a long weekend without fear.
Lastly, what exactly were those 'blue daisy flowers' which Mike was so
interested to discover? Mike is busy discovering at Kew, and he has come to
the conclusion which most gardeners share, anyway: that the longest-lasting
half-hardy little blue daisy on the market is Felicia Santa Anita. Perhaps
he has also discovered that you can easily train it with one central stem
into the shape of a small standard: if not, you and Mike might like to try
it, because it adds a touch of height in a family which otherwise sprawls.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Fishing: A character-building Irish monsoon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE times when a man is compelled to become more aware than usual of
his puniness in the face of the force of nature; such as when he finds a
river which he has crossed a sea to fish transformed between one day and the
next from a gentle stream into a scaled-down version of the Ganges at the
height of the monsoon.
In describing the events of my recent trip to Ireland, I shall endeavour to
maintain a tone of ironic detachment, rather than give way to outrage and
fist-shaking. I shall be philosophical, stoical, manly, for nothing is more
tiresome than self-pity. At least I shall try - but it will be hard.
The events took place this June, a month which the poets and other
ill-informed authorities tell us sees the first flowering of summer. This
year it saw instead the coming of tempest and deluge. And while I, my heart
full of childish excitement, was crossing the Irish Sea, the black clouds
were following fast.
It was to have been a free-and-easy week. Having no money to spend, I would
spend no money. I would follow my nose and my whim, helping myself here and
there to a taste of the wonderful wealth of free (or virtually free) trout
fishing with which Ireland is blessed.
That first day, I heard something on the news about people being rescued by
lifeboat from their bedroom windows in north Wales - and foolishly allowed
myself a secret smile of satisfaction that Ireland seemed to be escaping the
worst of it. I was intending to fish an little stream called the Deel, one
of a cluster of rivers west of Dublin (others include the Boyne and the
Blackwater) which offer demanding but first-rate trout fishing.
My friend Niall proposed a post-dinner sortie to fish the sedge. As I stood
outside his house getting my rod ready, there was a sprinkling of large
drops of rain. By the time we neared the river, it was raining with serious
intent. By the time we had legged it back to the house, it was beating down
and we were soused.
It stopped about 22 hours later. A podgy Irish weather forecaster appeared
on television with that guilty look of excitement that weather forecaster
have when the weather achieves unprecedented awfulness, and announced that
it had probably been the wettest day since Irish records began.
Unconsoled at the thought of witnessing the making of history, we splashed
down to the little river and found that it was a big, angry cocoa-coloured
river. There were no drowned sheep in it yet, but it seemed only a matter of
time.
We were not finished though. Reports from the west asserted that the rains
had held off, and we were soon hurtling through the floods towards the
green, wooded county of Clare and the neat little village of Corofin,
through which winds the river Fergus. Sure enough, as we headed down from
the Slieve Aughty mountains, the clouds lifted.
The Fergus connects a famous and lovely trout lough, Inchiquin, with a
string of lesser lakes, and is itself a remarkable and fascinating piece of
water. Running entirely though limestone, it is clear, rich in weed and full
of trout, some very big. It costs nothing to fish.
I know there are very big fish in it, because we met one. It rose on the far
side of a gorgeous pool upstream from Corofin. There was a terrific gurgling
suck as a late mayfly disappeared, followed by waves. With an immense cast,
I landed my fly somewhere near, and the fish dashed at it and missed.  There
were more waves.
These waves so impressed us that we went up to the bridge, and down the
other side so that we could attack the monster properly. First cast it
surged heart-stoppingly at the fly, but again did not take. It then retired
to ponder the folly of its greed, and was seen no more.
That evening the sun shone, and we had some very pleasing fishing for small
trout which rose with gusto to a hatch of blue-winged olives. Mid-way
through the following morning, after another vain assault on the leviathan
of the pool, the rain reached Corofin. It was no fleeting downpoour, but had
a settled long-term purpose, and it drove us away from the Fergus - vowing
to return one day.
I had planned that the triumphant coda to my trip should be the catching of
some salmon from the Cork Blackwater. We telephoned Frank, who guards the
fishing with a love bordering on obsession. He had had 17 fish that week,
four that day. Conditions were perfect.
Hardly had I said that I would be there next morning than it began to belt
down. It continued until I got there, by which time the river was the colour
of stout with a dash of milk. I flogged away for a day and a half without
getting a touch, then carried out a strategic withdrawal back across the
Irish Sea.
Since then, I have analysed my misfortunes, in a cool and reasoned way,
searching for the positive side. There can only be one, and it recalls what
they used to say at school about cross-country runs, arbitrary beatings and
the like: Good for the character.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Pictures from the past - Clive
Fewins meets a man who has made a careful living from restoring people's
memories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TROUBLE with photographs is that they do not last. Pull out your glossy
wedding portfolio 50 years on and you might well find faded and discoloured
sheets to dampen your golden wedding.
This is one of the reasons for the trend back to black and white
photography. 'Because they are composed of minute fragments of silver you
can expect black and white photographs to last much longer than colour
prints, which are based on impermanent dyes,' said Gerry Clarke.
Clarke restores black-and-white photographs - dating back as far as the
1850s. At his workshop overlooking open fields near the Oxfordshire village
of Kingham, Clarke is hard-pressed to cope with the flood of pictures that
arrive from all over Britain, the US and Australia.
'For some reason a chap who runs a fish and chip shop in San Francisco keeps
sending me work, and the other day I even had a visitor from Trinidad who
had heard of me and managed to penetrate my rural isolation,' he said. 'It
always amazes me the distances people travel to bring their old photographs
to me.'
Many British customers, reluctant to commit their valued family archives to
the post, visit and inspect Clarke and his enterprise before becoming
customers.
Others - including several elderly ladies in Devon and north Wales - are
happy to keep posting their family archival shots, half a dozen at a time. A
woman from Dawlish, who always adds her age ('ninety-three-and-a-half') to
her signature, has spent several hundred pounds over the past two years.
'With photographs anything up to 140 years old I am often dealing with items
of great sentimental value that people only grudgingly leave in my care,'
Clarke said. 'I get an inevitable finger-wagging lecture from virtually
everyone that comes in here to see me. But I am always conscious that we are
reckoned to have only 10 per cent of the photographs taken in Victoria's
reign left in this country and I realise how valuable as historical
documents the majority of the prints I handle will be in 100 years.'
Clarke works by the meticulous use of a De Vere 504 enlarger with a copy
back as a rostrum camera. Using optical filters and a variety of techniques
he has perfected over nearly 40 years he is able to restore faded images,
eliminate stains and discolouration and remove evidence of creasing and
tearing so that the restored prints are generally of a much higher quality
than the originals he works from.
He is reluctant to replace missing images in sections of a print. 'Where
there is a detail missing I leave it to the imagination. If it is a group I
could always fill in a face, but I won't,' he said.
Clarke is a one-man band. When he started Photocare at 52, five-and-a-half
years ago, one of his aims was to keep turnover below the minimum VAT level
to avoid additional administration. He is finding that increasingly
difficult. 'My attitude was that I wasn't necessarily chasing the last buck
all the time, and I certainly wasn't into the horrors of VAT returns,' he
said.
Having enjoyed 20 comfortable years in the building trade and with his three
children now grown up, Clarke decided to concentrate on what he really
enjoyed doing and to turn his hobby into a living.
He invested Pounds 10,000 of his savings, did a little of advertising in
consumer magazines, and waited for customers.
'I was not desperately worried if the business started slowly. My wife was
working and I knew I could count on some orders from people I had done work
for when I restored photographs as a hobby,' he said. 'But nevertheless I
had locked up a lot of my savings, so it was important that the venture was
a success.'
He need not have worried. The word spread quickly and Clarke soon found he
had a healthy portfolio of large customers such as military units and local
authority and company archivists.
Although the basic price is low - Pounds 4.85 to photograph an original
print and supply a 5in x 4in negative - many of the customers' orders are
large. This and repeat orders means that the average price of a job is a
healthy Pounds 100 or so.
This pleases Clarke, as Photocare is very much a value-added business. He
estimates that materials comprise just under 10 per cent of turnover. As his
only large overhead is his rent of Pounds 600 a quarter he can justifiably
claim that his profitability as a percentage of turnover is probably as high
as in any business.
'As it is a craft trade, in which I use my hands I am unlikely to make vast
profits. However, it is a very satisfying means of making a living.'
If there are dark clouds they concern the problems of success. There really
is too much work for one.
'I know that if I was actively considering growth I would easily be able to
build up the institutional side of the business. They say nostalgia is the
thing of the future, and Photocare has now grown to a point where it has a
value, and so I must push forward.
'Employing someone else will inevitably take me over the VAT limit and we
shall really be in business. It must happen - especially as there seems to
be a dearth of people offering this kind of service.
'One possibility is for my teacher brother, who is a little younger, to join
me. We could then possibly add a library of old photographs to our services.
I already have a collection of nearly 5,000 and people keep offering them to
me. Whatever happens I must do something - even if only to make sure I get
back to the golf course when I reach 65]'

FT  26 JUN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Is scrip trustworthy?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ENHANCED scrip dividends are worth so much more than normal cash dividends
that it is desirable to take them up. In the case of a trust that has to pay
income during the income beneficiary's life and after his death the capital
to the remaindermen, what should the trustees do about this?
Would the trustees be meeting the interests of the life tenant and the
remaindermen if they took the enhanced scrip dividends, sold the scrip
shares and paid the proceeds to the life tenant (less any capital gains tax
attributable to the sale of scrip shares)?
Subject to the precise wording of the trust deed, the trustees will be duty
bound to elect for the scrip dividends. They would have a complaint of
negligence to face if they failed to do so.
They should also ask the life tenant whether he or she wishes the scrip to
be sold. If they cannot obtain the life tenant's instructions before the
deadline for accepting the offer-to-purchase, they will probably be acting
in the best interests of all concerned if they go ahead and accept it.
Subject to wording of the deed, it is likely that the scrip vests in the
life tenant at the moment of issue. That being so, the trustees would not
have any CGT liability in respect of the sale of the scrip, because their
CGT position (and the life tenant's) will be governed by section 142 of the
Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992:
Before delivering the scrip or the proceeds of its sale to the life tenant,
the trustees may consider it prudent to seek the advice of the trust's
solicitor on the effect of the precise wording of the deed.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: My uncle's Italian debt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY MOTHER was incapacitated and in a home for the elderly. She set up a
joint account with my uncle so that he could administer her money for her.
I discovered that my uncle helped himself to some of my mother's money. Both
are now dead. Did my uncle incur a debt in respect of my mother, and as my
mother's sole heir do I have a claim on his estate? (I am a co-heir with my
cousins, and we are all nephews and nieces as my uncle had no children).
All this was in Italy, is the law likely to be different there?
Before I describe how English Law would treat the problem you describe, I
must emphasise that any remedy which you may have is a matter solely for
Italian Law. Italian Law is based on Roman Law; English Law is not, and so
the latter is an inadequate guide to the Italian Law treatment of your
problem.
In English Law, the creation of the joint bank account created a trust. If
your uncle misappropriated funds from the account, then he is probably in
breach of trust.
That breach has caused a loss to the trust fund and he is therefore liable
to reimburse the fund with the amount taken. Although your uncle ceased to
be a trustee on his death, the liability of a trustee for a breach of trust
survives against his executors and estate.
Compensation can therefore be sought by you and the other beneficiaries
against the estate of your late uncle.
A trust is a concept peculiar to Anglo-Saxon Law and there is no such
concept in Roman or Italian Law. However, I would find it odd if Italian Law
did not afford you some remedy in such a situation.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: River Plate catches a new tide -
Philip Coggan examines a trust that started with Argentina and now thinks
global / Doing the Splits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RIVER PLATE and General Investment trust was a 19th century example of that
recent fashion, the emerging markets fund. It was founded in 1888,
specifically to invest in Argentinian companies. The policy was changed only
in 1952, when it was allowed to buy securities anywhere.
The decision to go for a split structure came in 1987, when other trusts
such as River &amp; Mercantile and Scottish National were making similar moves.
At the time, many people questioned the need for general trusts. Some
disappeared through takeover; others restructured in an attempt to please
their shareholders by eliminating the discount to net assets on which the
shares traded.
River Plate was one of the first to launch zero dividend preference shares.
These have first claim on the assets of the trust and their entitlement
grows at a set rate of 12.28 per cent a year so that, eventually, they are
repaid at 100p in 1996.
According to fund manager Jupiter Tyndall, these zeros have the best cover
in the market, with the trust currently having enough assets to meet the
final redemption value 2.5 times. Or, put another way, the trust's assets
would have to decline by 23 per cent a year between now and 1996 for the
zeros not to be repaid in full.
Because they are seen as safe, the zeros offer the lowest yields in the
sector, with a gross redemption yield of just 7.4 per cent. But investors
who have owned them since issue have had a good deal: the price has doubled
and the increase is taxed as capital gain, not income.
The income shares receive all the revenue of the trust and are entitled to
be repaid at 100p on wind-up. Jupiter Tyndall says there are enough assets
to meet the final repayment value of the income shares 1.1 times. The final
dividend was maintained last year at 8.9p and the interim dividend has since
been maintained at 3p. On Wednesday's share price of 103p, the income shares
are on a flat yield of 10.8 per cent.
Philip Middleton, analyst at Smith New Court, says the income shares are
decent value provided the trust is able to maintain the final dividend.
The capital shares receive all the assets of the trust after the other
classes have been repaid. As with other split trusts, there are two ways of
assessing the asset value of the capital shares.
If you allow only for the present claims of the other classes, the net asset
value is 131.9p, putting the shares (at 56p) at a whopping 58.3 per cent
discount. But if you allow for the wind-up claims of the other classes, the
assets per capital share are just 11p, according to Middleton. Thus, on a
conservative basis, the shares are trading at a substantial premium.
As with most of the other trusts launched in 1987, it is the capital
shareholders who have lost out. When River Plate was launched, the capital
shares had assets of 250p each and an original trading price of 100p.
Middleton says the capital shares are 'a bit dear.' If the trust's assets
grow at 5 per cent a year, he says the shares would return 9.2 per cent a
year. He points out that a high asset growth rate is more difficult to
achieve because of the high portfolio yield.
But a recent research note from Iqbal Assan, at Olliff &amp; Partners, said the
shares 'are among the most highly-geared in the sector and have considerable
appeal for investors taking a bullish view of the UK equity market over the
next three years.'
The note does, however, emphasise that the shares are a high-risk
recommendation.
There are also warrants, which entitle the holder to buy capital shares at
250p each. Given that the capital shares will need to quintuple within three
years for it to be worthwhile exercising the warrants, the latter are
trading at just 2p.
The trust is managed by Michael Heathcoat Amory, a nephew of a former
Conservative chancellor. He says the trust has a large number of stocks in
its portfolio (200), with an overweighting in small and medium sized
companies which has helped its performance lately. In the six months to
April 30, total assets rose by 19 per cent, compared with a rise of 10.5 per
cent in the FT-A All Share index.
The 10 largest holdings at the end of April were: PWS Holdings (a small
insurance broker), Shell, BAT Industries, General Electric, Scottish Power,
Williams Holdings (convertible), Merlin Jupiter American Capital fund,
Mezzanine Capital and Income trust (income shares), and Dalgety. Heathcoat
Amory says the yield on the portfolio is 6.5 per cent.
The holding in Merlin Jupiter American Capital (a Jupiter Tyndall managed
unit trust) has recently been reduced and Heathcoat Amory says that Jupiter
Tyndall funds now make up just 6 per cent of the trust's assets.
Smith New Court's Middleton adds: 'In terms of fund management, the trust
has performed creditably without being outstanding.' Figures from the
Association of Investment Trust Companies show River Plate's total return of
shareholders' funds has been above average (for the split capital sector)
over the past year, below average over the past three years, and above
average over five years.
Key facts
Total assets at the end of April were Pounds 99.1m and the annual management
fee is 0.5 per cent of assets. The trust is due to be wound up on October
31, 1996.
Board
Peter Hill-Wood, the chairman, is also vice-chairman of Hambros Bank. Other
outsiders on the board are Andrew Buxton, a director of Norwich Union; Harry
Littlefair, former vice-chairman of Allied Dunbar Unit Trusts; and Simon de
Zoete, a director of BZW. Jupiter Tyndall men on the board are John
Duffield, Heathcoat Amory and Timothy Pilkington.
Savings scheme and Pep details
There is no savings scheme and Jupiter Tyndall does not run Peps. But River
Plate is Pep-qualifying for those with a self-select plan.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: CGT allowances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TABLE shows capital gains tax (CGT) allowances for assets sold in May.
To use it, multiply the original cost of the asset for the figure shown for
the month in which you bought it. If you subtract the result from the
proceeds of your sale, the balance will be your taxable gain or loss.
Suppose that you bought shares for Pounds 5,000 in June 1985 and sold them
in May 1993 for Pounds 13,000. Multiplying the original cost by the June
1985 figure of 1.479 gives a total of Pounds 7,395.
Subtracting that from the proceeds of Pounds 13,000 gives a capital gain of
Pounds 5,605, which is below the 1993-94 CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800. If
you realise no other gains during the year, the profits should be tax-free.
If you sell shares bought before April 6 1982, you should use the March 1982
figure. The RPI in May was 141.1.

FOOD retailers have not enjoyed favourable conditions, at least not in the
stock market. But Nurdin &amp; Peacock has proved something of an exception.
Since late last year the shares have risen from 130p to the current level
and deputy chairman David Rowley has sold 110,000 shares at 219p. He has
effectively halved his holding to just under 96,000 shares.
Although quoted under food retailing, the company has been cushioned from
the worst effects of pressure on margins by its operations in the cash and
carry business. This is reflected in a trend of increase in earnings which
looks set to continue.
The chairman and managing director of Dagenham Motors, David Philip, has
sold 375,000 shares at 105p for personal reasons. Like all motor dealers
Dagenham has enjoyed something of a rally in the share price over the last
six months although it is perhaps less pronounced than some of its peers.
Shares in Comac Group, the computer consultant, took off when it was
announced that Philip Swinstead had bought 1.25m shares and joined the board
as chief executive. Swinstead cut his teeth at SD-Scicon and the fact that
he had paid a substantial premium to the market price is a positive sign. A
few days later two directors took the opportunity to reduce their holdings
on the back of the rise in share price. Mike Winsley, managing director,
sold his entire holding of 480,000 shares and is retiring from the board
while Mr Lambert sold 50,000 shares of which he is the beneficial holder and
a further 450,000 in which he has a non-beneficial interest.

CURRENCY PLAYS are an important component of international bond investing
and fund managers indicate that this is where the main gains in coming
months may be.
International bond funds deal in securities issued by foreign (and UK)
governments and corporations. The opportunity for better performance is, in
theory, greater than for onshore funds since they have a choice of bond
markets to invest in and are able to use different currencies to their
advantage. But with greater opportunity comes greater risk: these funds are
regarded as more volatile than onshore bond funds, although less risky than
equities.
The table shows the 10 largest funds with one year performance figures
figures. On that basis, Schroder's Global bond fund, with Pounds 58.3m under
management, has been excluded. Yields have dropped slightly but not
significantly since we last published the table, on May 22.
Nick Henderson, head of fixed interest at Gartmore, expects the return from
international bonds to be greater than for cash over the next year against a
background of global growth and low inflation. He expects currency gains
from an appreciation of the dollar and the yen against sterling and capital
gains in continental Europe where interest rates, led by Germany, should
continue their fall.
The fund's holding is 49 per cent in US dollar-denominated bonds, 16 per
cent in Canadian bonds and 12 per cent in yen-denominated bonds. The rest is
in France (2 per cent), Italy (3 per cent), Denmark (4 per cent), Spain (7
per cent) and the UK (7 per cent). Although this is a 'total returns' fund,
the yield is lower than for most of the other funds, reflecting, according
to Henderson, its current weighting to the US market.
Perpetual's Global bond fund, managed by George McNeil of Alpha, is also
heavily invested in dollar-denominated bonds. The fund is top of the sector
in terms of performance over one year and has a healthy yield. The currency
breakdown is US dollar (40 per cent), Canadian dollar (10 per cent), gilts
(17-18 per cent); the rest is in French, Spanish and Danish bonds, which are
all hedged into sterling.
'Over the next nine months the dollar could rise to Dollars 1.80 or Dollars
1.85 against the D-mark. Sterling will perform less well against the dollar
but will do well against everything else,' says mcNeill. He is eschewing the
Japanese market, which formed part of the portfolio last year, because it
now looks overvalued. The fund has a 5.25 per cent initial charge and a 1
per cent annual management fee with a minimum investment of Pounds 1,000.
Charges on the Gartmore fund are 3.75 per cent initial, 0.75 management.
Minimum lump sum investment is Pounds 1,000.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: How to insure the family yacht -
Luckily for amateur sailors, pleasure boat insurance is highly competitive

<TEXT>
and from - boats have soared over the last few years.
Dennis Mossman, yacht manager of Navigators and General, a subsidiary of the
Eagle Star insurance company, says that small speedboats are most at risk.
'Bigger boats that are taken are mostly found, but small speedboats you
never find again. The theft rate for those is enormous,' he says.
Equipment left on board moored boats, even masts and winches, is another
target for thieves. General Accident agrees about the scale of the problem.
At least a third of its boat claims are now crime related, and the majority
of claims over Pounds 10,000 are for theft. However, Mossman says the rise
seems to have peaked.
Luckily for all amateur sailors, pleasure boat insurance is a highly
competitive area, possibly because the recession has meant fewer new yachts
being sold and needing insurance, and existing ones are kept out of use. So
in spite of rising crime rates, premiums for most classes of boat have not
risen in line.
Premiums are calculated using a combination of factors on an individual
basis, with no standard table of rates.
'It's not like cars - there are thousands of different types of boats,' says
Mossman. 'You can't just say, 'it's a Ford Escort'.'
On average, premiums work out at about 1 per cent of a boat's value - likely
to be more for speedboats and less for sailing boats not used for racing.
Larger boats, even if worth less, can cost more to repair because of the
difficulty in getting them out of the water, so size can affect the amount
you have to pay.
Where the boat is kept also makes a difference. If it is small and normally
kept out of the water, there may be stringent security conditions requiring
it to be kept under lock and with its trailer wheel-clamped. A boat in a
marina may be cheaper to insure than one at an isolated river mooring, and
inner city moorings may incur higher premiums.
'Where there are more boats there is usually better security,' says Dennis
Mossman, but of course marina berths can be pricy.
Policies may also specify that if a boat is to be kept out during the
winter, the mooring must be approved by the insurer.
The area where you intend to use your boat will also affect the premium.
Cover is often restricted to inland waterways and UK coastal waters, but can
usually be extended to Europe, the Mediterranean, the US east coast, or the
Caribbean. Round-the-world yachtsmen may have difficulty getting insurance
as standard policies from British insurers rarely stretch beyond the
Atlantic, and an individual deal may be prohibitively costly.
Racing can be another pricy area, though small-scale family and club racing
are not generally seen as too risky. Chris Day, managing director of Jardine
Maritime, one of the specialist brokers for private yacht insurance, warns
that for racing risks you will have to pay the first third of any claim,
which can be expensive.
Christopher Knox-Johnston (brother of the famous yachtsman), of Haven
Knox-Johnston, yacht insurers at Lloyd's, says that one of the biggest
problems is people's ignorance of what to do in the event of an accident
claim. The procedure differs from a motor insurance claim. There are no
'knock-for-knock' agreements among marine insurers.
Boat owners are responsible for making the boat safe, getting estimates,
paying repair bills and claiming them back from the insurer.
They should also write to the other party involved in an accident to hold
them liable. Knox-Johnston's advice is to contact the insurer as soon as
possible after an accident or theft to check how to proceed.
The cover provided under most policies is based on the institute yacht
clauses used at Lloyd's, which include named 'marine perils' such as
breaking adrift, groundings and collisions, as well as fire and theft.
Since the clauses were rewritten in 1985, however, many insurers have
developed their own wording, so cover may vary. Haven Knox-Johnston now
offers an all-risks policy. It is important to look at the level of cover as
well as the price when choosing a policy.
Wear and tear, design problems, mechanical failure and war damage are
excluded by many policies. Theft of equipment and possessions may be covered
only if there is forcible entry - if you leave a boat unattended and
unlocked, even for a few minutes, you may unable to claim for anything
stolen. The small print may specify security precautions needed, especially
for high-risk items such as boats on trailers and outboard motors.
Other security measures, such as photographing the boat, recording serial
numbers and marking all equipment, dinghies and so on with the boat's name
and owner's postcode, are strongly recommended.
As the market for boat insurance is relatively small, there is a very
limited number of providers, and perhaps a dozen specialist brokers. One of
the big names is Navigators and General, which sells its policies mostly
through brokers, and specialises in medium sized boats, over 16ft 6in,
valued at up to Pounds 1.5m. The average value is Pounds 25,000.
Haven Knox-Johnston has a range of three plain English, all-risks boat
policies, which are sold through ordinary insurance brokers who would
otherwise not offer yacht cover. No-claims discounts of up to 20 per cent
are also available.
Specialist brokers can also offer policies from European insurers, which
usually provide similar cover, but not always - you should check the small
print. Some may exclude third party liability, for example.
Members of the Royal Yachting Association are entitled to a 10 per cent
discount on insurance bought through brokers Bishop Skinner, and holders of
certain RYA qualifications can get further discounts.
General Accident is one of the general insurers which can provide yacht
cover. It has two basic policies, one for small craft up to 16ft 6in, and
one for larger yachts and motor boats. It offers no-claim bonuses of up to
25 per cent after five years.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: BES schemes go back to college
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OXBRIDGE colleges are the current theme of Business Expansion Scheme
launches with Oxford dominating this week and Cambridge to come next week,
writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu.
On Tuesday, Hodgson Martin launched The Residences at Oxford Companies to
buy existing student accommodation from Exeter, St Edmund Hall, St Hugh's,
St Peter's and Wadham colleges. The colleges are promising to buy back the
accommodation after five years at 118p for every 100p invested. The returns
equate to an annual return of 13.7 per cent compound for a higher rate
taxpayer and 9.2 per cent for a basic rate taxpayer. The scheme is backed
with gilts.
Oriel Cash Backed, sponsored by Downing Corporate Finance, is is a
restructured version of Oriel residences, an early exit scheme which was
caught out by the Budget changes. It is offering a contracted exit of 121p
after five years for every 100p invested to buy residential property for the
college. The returns to a higher rate taxpayer would be 14 per cent per
annum, 9.6 per cent for lower rate, and are supported by cash deposits.
Best BES Advice comment on the schemes is positive. It says of Oriel Cash
Backed, 'a combination of a high return and the cash backing arrangements
with Oriel provide for an attractive investment.' It also recommends the The
Residences at Oxford issue as 'a secure cash backed deal with a competitive
return.'
Capital Ventures will announce a cash-back contracted exit scheme next week
involving three Cambridge colleges - Churchill, Pembroke and Trinity Hall.
It says it will repay 117p for every 100p invested.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Household and motor premiums to rise
again - Falling investment returns to blame
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PREMIUMS for household and motor insurance are to rise for the third
straight year despite a fall in claims. Ian Rushton, outgoing chairman of
the Association of British Insurers, this week blamed declining investment
returns for the higher premiums which he said would be needed to reduce
underwriting losses.
Provisional figures from the ABI showed insurance companies virtually broke
even last year, with expenses and claims exceeding premium and investment
income by only 0.2 per cent compared with 12 per cent in 1991. The
improvement arose from reduced operating expenses, loss prevention
initiatives, lower claims and rating increases.
Rushton, releasing the ABI's annual report, said motor claims had fallen,
particularly for comprehensive policies, while there also had been a
reduction in the rate of increase of motor crime. The companies' income from
motor premiums rose by 12 per cent.
An increase in income from general insurance premiums helped to cut
underwriting losses, along with falls in commercial theft claims (13 per
cent), commercial fire claims (20 per cent) and subsidence claims (52 per
cent). Domestic mortgage indemnity losses, at around Pounds 750m, were down
by more than a third compared with 1991.
The report cited a number of initiatives which had helped to cut general
insurance claims. These included an arson prevention campaign in association
with the Home Office, and an anti-fraud drive aimed at preventing bogus
claims. Rushton said: 'These are all beginning to bear fruit, with reduced
claims in many of these areas. If this continues, we could see greater
stability in premiums.'
The ABI is talking to police and the Department of Transport about raising
fines on uninsured motorists. It says these are too low to discourage guilty
drivers.
On the life and pensions side, companies reported record premiums last year,
with total income from this source rising by 8.9 per cent to Pounds 43bn.
Explaining the need for higher household and car premiums, however, Rushton
said: 'Results did improve last year but we still lost money.
'Significant rate increases have been introduced and their full effect will
come through to companies over this year. Insurance companies have taken
action to put the industry back on the right track, but we still have some
way to go to return to full profitability.'
But unlike last year, when the ABI forecast rises across the board of 15-20
per cent, it refused to make predictions this time except to say that
further increases were expected to vary widely and would depend on the
position of individual companies.
Last month, the ABI estimated that home insurance premiums rose by an
average of 20-25 per cent over the past year, but many readers have reported
increases well above this.
Motor insurance premiums also have been rising, and the Consumers'
Association advises people to shop around for quotations. It says that
despite the ABI's words of warning there is nothing inevitable about
increased premiums.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Funds to follow fashion - High
income and emerging markets are the current favourites. Are they attractive?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THERE is a dominant investment theme of the moment, it is the desire for
investors to get a decent income.
Years of high inflation and high interest rates have led most investors to
regard 'decent' as being more than 10 per cent.
The problem, with base rates at 6 per cent, is that it is hard to get a
double digit income without taking some risks.
As we reported last Saturday, Fidelity, a leading fund management group, has
written to the regulators expressing concern about a number of products
which appear to offer a high level of income, but which may well just be
paying back the investor's capital.
A classic example of this kind of product was launched this week by Life
Association of Scotland, which is offering an income of 10.1 per cent (net
of basic rate tax), paid quarterly for five years.
What is the snag? Like previous products from Acuma or Save &amp; Prosper, LAS
does not promise to return your original capital. It will only do so if the
FT-SE 100 Index grows at 8.75 per cent per annum over the next five years.
It does guarantee that the total of your income payments, plus what is left
after five years, will at least add up to your original investment. In other
words, if you invest Pounds 10,000, you will get Pounds 4,870 in interest
over five years, and if the FT-SE Index does not grow you will get Pounds
5,130 of capital back.
There are a couple of things to note here. The first is that the interest
payment equates to Pounds 974 a year, not the Pounds 1,010 which one might
naturally expect to get if offered 10.1 per cent on Pounds 10,000. This is
because an income paid quarterly is deemed to 'compound up' at a higher rate
than income paid annually.
Secondly, the guarantee offered is very similar to that available from other
products, which promise stock market growth or your money back. The LAS
product just parcels up the same return in a different way.
Investors should realise that if the guarantee comes into play after five
years, they will have lost out. If they had kept the money in the building
society, they would have earned interest on top of their original capital.
The product is really only a good deal if investors get their capital back
as well as the interest payments. How likely is this? LAS calculated that,
in all the five year periods, from 1984 to the present day (ie Jan 1, 1984
to Jan 1, 1989, Jan 2, 1984 to Jan 2, 1989 and so on), the average growth
rate has been 9.59 per cent.
So a target of 8.75 per cent, it argues, is not too steep (as with many
other products in this field, investors get no credit for the dividend yield
on the index, but LAS's calculations allow for this).
But if the index rises by more than 8.75 per cent per year, investors will
get no credit for the excess.
Provided investors understand all the nuances, this is not a bad product
(higher rate taxpayers should note that the yield for them falls to 8.6 per
cent). The concern is that people look at the income figure and do not
bother to read the rest.
To avoid these problems, LAS says it asked Lautro, the life industry
regulator, for an opinion on its promotional material. The brochure
certainly does explain the risks; potential investors should make sure they
read it in full.
Another very fashionable area of the moment is emerging markets, the stock
markets of developing countries; we reported on the launch of a Govett
investment trust last week.
Kleinwort Benson is also launching a trust in the area but it claims a more
'scientific' approach to emerging market investment. Asset allocation is
more important than stock selection, says Kleinwort, since analysis shows
that two-thirds of the movement of an individual stock price can be
explained by the change in the general level of the emerging market.
Kleinwort also says that many of the current emerging market indices are too
heavily weighted towards individual markets (particularly Mexico and
Venezuela) and are thus very volatile.
It favours a more balanced index, where weightings are equally spread and
regularly rebalanced to allow for market movements.
The new trust will follow a number of rules. It will never have more than 10
per cent in any one emerging market; if a market has risen by more than 50
per cent in the preceding year, the trust's maximum weighting will be 7.5
per cent; if a market has fallen by more than 50 per cent in the previous 12
months, the trust's minimum weighting will be 2.5 per cent.
Kleinwort says its disciplined approach has worked for its offshore Emerging
Markets fund, which has risen 22.8 per cent since launch in February 1992,
compared with a rise of 12.8 per cent in the IFC Composite index (the
standard benchmark for emerging markets) over the same period.
The new trust will be launched on July 2. Shares will be offered at 100p
each, with warrants attached on a one-for-five basis. The minimum investment
will be Pounds 1,000.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Good timing is the key for a flutter
on BT3 - Do-it-yourself investor Bernice Cohen provides her own handy guide
for those thinking of putting money into the new issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNICE COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS A committed DIMI (do-it-myself investor) relying on my own research to
manage a share portfolio, I have learned by painful experience that correct
timing is as important as good stock selection for achieving profits. So,
like thousands of small investors weighing the merits of the BT3 share
issue, I ask myself if this is the right time to put money into BT.
I use a mnemonic, 'gains are fast,' to search for small capitalisation
growth stocks with big prospects. It also proved appropriate for Glaxo, the
giant pharmaceutical company, during its outperformance from September 1990
to spring 1992.
Many press reports are covering the fundamental aspects of BT but 'gains are
fast' incorporates a belt and braces approach, considering both fundamental
and technical data. So, how does BT measure up to my criteria?
G - growth in earnings per share (EPS) should at least have doubled over the
past five years. Astonishingly, for such a huge organisation, BT's EPS more
than doubled (from 15.1p to 34p) between 1985 and 1991. Since then,
recession and redundancy costs have marred this record, resulting in an EPS
for 1992 of only 19.8p.
A - annual earnings per share growth should exceed 20 per cent. This year, a
profits rebound of more than 46 per cent is forecast widely; accordingly,
EPS should recover by more than 20 per cent.
I - institutional support helps to improve trading liquidity. The strenuous
efforts of lead broker SG Warburg to encourage massive institutional support
have been reported widely. This could keep the share price high before the
issue is launched - excellent news for hard-pressed UK taxpayers but less
promising for small investors.
N - new products or management, or a new high in the share price, or niche
markets which confer strong growth advantages. BT's early monopoly position
enhanced shareholders' returns, but more competition and closer regulation
might prevent a repeat performance.
S - supply/demand for the shares. Small capitalisation plus demand
encourages a rising share price. For BT, the UK's largest quoted company
with a capitalisation of more than Pounds 25bn, the supply/demand balance
depends crucially on growth prospects.
As a major force in the rapidly expanding global telecommunications
industry, BT could become a highly attractive investment because it has
long-term appeal for two different types of investor: income-seekers and
growth-seekers. This decade, BT could be a rare but profitable hybrid - a
'growth utility' generating healthy capital gains with steadily rising
dividends. Since 1985, gross dividends have more than doubled. A growth
utility is surely the ideal Pep investment.
A - ambitious owner/managers are eager for success. Chairman Iain Vallance
wants BT to become a global operator, but early attempts were unsuccessful
and the 20 per cent stake in MCI is too recent a development to be judged.
R - rich in cash companies have no debt. BT is in one of the most
cash-generating businesses, with a miniscule 14 per cent of debt.
E - efficient management builds leading, not lagging, companies. Efficiency
is revealed by savage cost-cutting, vast improvements to customer services,
and that astonishing triumph of modern technology - vandal-proof public
'phone booths.
F - fundamental facts inform on the present and prospective share price.
Forecast profits for 1994 imply earnings per share of about 32p. A price of
Pounds 4.30 produces a forward price/earnings ratio of 13.4. This compares
with BT's historic p/e of 21, 23 for Cable and Wireless, and 19.6 for
Vodaphone.
P/e ratios of around 20 suggest the market rates telephone network companies
as growth stocks. If the forward p/e for BT reaches 15 by December 1993, the
BT share price would rise to Pounds 4.80; by July 1994, a forward p/e of 20
could lift the price to Pounds 6.40.
A - act if growth falters. I bale out rapidly on profit warnings, setbacks,
or if a chart falls below its uptrend.
S - stock market direction. Few shares prosper in falling markets, but the
performance of different sectors since the start of 1993 might give clues on
BT's position as that rare investment entity, a growth utility.
Since December 31 1992, the highest sectors - gold, aerospace engineering
and property - have all been classic late cyclical sectors. Meanwhile,
traditional growth sectors languish at the foot of the performance tables:
food retailing, brewing and distillers, and health and household. Telephone
networks show a modest rise. The fact that late cyclical sectors are star
1993 performers suggests we could be nearing the peak of a mature bull
market, which is already discounting recovery in the real economy. An
investment in BT now could prove timely, as utilities are hot favourites
with institutional investors when other sectors look stale or fully valued.
T - technical analysis. What does the share price chart imply? I find charts
give good guidance on buying and selling decisions, and in assessing the
potential for a share price rise. It is impossible to show them in
sufficient detail here, but my reading of them suggests that a year-end
target price of Pounds 4.80 looks feasible and a target price for mid-1994
of Pounds 5.50 on the fully-paid shares looks possible. To reach Pounds
6.40, though, the price would have to break out of present trends.
EPS has fallen over the past five years. But, if both technical and
fundamental projections hold, then the prospective capital gain, plus the
predicted 13.3 per cent gross dividend yield for this coming year, suggest
BT is a good Pep investment proposition now.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: ICI acts over staff options -
Restructuring disrupts share schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE OPTION schemes can be disrupted when companies are restructured - as
18,300 employees belonging to ICI's save-as-you-earn/share-save schemes, and
more than 10,000 holders of its personal equity plans, have just discovered.
With the former, employees agree to save between Pounds 10 and Pounds 250 a
month for at least five years. The idea was for the accumulated money, plus
a tax-free bonus, to be used to buy shares in the company at an option price
fixed when the savings term began. (Some schemes run on for a further two
years, doubling the five-year tax-free bonus).
In the 13 years since the schemes were launched, the Treasury and the Inland
Revenue have approved various ways of handling the aftermath of mergers and
takeovers - including early exercise of options and transfers from one
company's scheme to another's - mostly without penalising savers.
But the authorities have taken a tougher line with demergers - which were,
apparently, not foreseen by legislators early in the 1980s.
Demerging firms forfeit the privileged tax treatment of share-save schemes
if they adjust the prices of options granted already to reflect the lower
value of shares brought about by a demerger, or allow savers to exercise
their options ahead of the restructuring.
ICI decided to allow holders of options on 3.4m shares priced at Pounds
8.14, Pounds 8.91 and Pounds 9.66 to exercise their options in time to
receive a Zeneca demerger share and a Zeneca rights share (nil paid).
Holders of options priced at Pounds 11.83, Pounds 12.26 and Pounds 13.81,
covering 3.9m company shares, were offered cash instead because exercising
the options would have meant paying more than the market value.
These amendments to the scheme made the savers liable for income tax on
their options or the cash alternative, but ICI paid compensation for the
extra tax due.
Luckily for the employees, the company was following the example of Racal in
the 1991 Vodafone demerger. Employees of BAT in the 1990 split, involving
Argos and Wiggins Teape Appleton, lost out on the price reduction resulting
from the demergers and faced extra tax without help from the group.
Most of the 10,000-plus investors who held ICI shares through the
single-company or general Peps run by the Bradford and Bingley building
society have chosen to sit out the demerger so far, according to Sean
Warters of the society's Pep department.
This is partly because of the society's insistence that the terms and
conditions of the Peps require investment in ICI, not Zeneca.
So, although Pep-holders can keep the Zeneca shares they have received
within the ICI plans, the society is selling off the Zeneca rights to
re-invest in ICI, and will also use any dividends received from either
company to buy more ICI shares.
Investors who want to convert an ICI single-company Pep into a Zeneca
single-company Pep, or switch a general Pep from ICI to Zeneca, will have to
change plan managers, paying an exit fee of 0.5 per cent of the plan value
to the society and, probably, setting-up charges to the new manager as well.
Switching out of Zeneca is simpler. Pep-holders have until September 30 to
make a written request for a sale of Zeneca shares held for re-investment in
ICI.
The Bradford and Bingley will be charging Pounds 15 plus VAT on top of
dealing commission and stamp duty on these switches.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Special offers on BT3 shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DETAILS are still coming in of special offers on dealing commissions for BT3
shares after the sell-off next month, writes Bethan Hutton. Some of the
offers will also apply to shares in other companies, as banks and
stockbrokers attempt to win new clients for their services.
The Share Centre (0442-890 800) will buy or sell up to Pounds 1,000 worth of
BT3 shares for a minimum commission of Pounds 10. For amounts up to Pounds
2,000, the commission is 1 per cent, and 0.8 per cent for Pounds
2,000-Pounds 5,000. For tone 'phone deals, the commission is reduced by 20
per cent. The offer also applies to other popular shares, including Northern
Ireland Electricity. On postal sales it offers a family package, with a
charge of Pounds 2.50 for each additional transfer of the same type of
share.
Midland bank branches will charge half their usual commission on purchases
of all UK quoted shares between July 19 and October 1. The minimum will be
Pounds 10 for deals up to Pounds 1,333; after that, commission will be 0.75
per cent, with a maximum of Pounds 75. Sales of BT shares will attract the
same rates. Up to four BT certificates bearing the same surname and address
can be sold as a single deal.
At Sharelink (021-200 2474), commission starts at 1 per cent (minimum Pounds
7.50) for buying through its new AutoDeal 24-hour telephone push-button
system. Selling through AutoDeal costs 1 per cent (minimum Pounds 12.50).
Commission on ordinary telephone dealing in BT shares will be 1.5 per cent
for the first Pounds 2,500 (minimum Pounds 15). Family groups will be
charged an extra Pounds 2.50 a member for dealing in BT shares. Transfer of
BT shares to a Sharelink Premier Pep is free.
For BT3 applicants, the Leeds building society is waiving the normal Pounds
10 fee for membership of its share-dealing service until September 3.
Commission rates for telephone dealing are as normal: 1.25 per cent (minimum
Pounds 18) for deals up to Pounds 3,000. Selling by post costs Pounds 9.95
for transactions up to Pounds 2,500, and 0.75 per cent for larger amounts.
The government this week reminded investors that making multiple
applications for BT3 shares was a criminal offence, and appointed Price
Waterhouse as fraud auditor. You can register for the offer at any number of
share shops, but only one application for the public offer may be made by
each individual. You can apply for both the public offer and the retail
tender.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: BUPA premium changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUPA is to cut premiums on some of its medical insurance schemes and freeze
others, but subscribers to the main BUPACare scheme aged over 60 will face
premium increases of up to 12 per cent.
Rates will be cut by 10 per cent for the low-cost schemes Healthchoice,
which covers private treatment if the NHS waiting list is more than six
weeks, and Essentialcare, which has exclusions such as outpatient
consultations. Premiums will be frozen for the LocalCare scheme, where
treatment is restricted to one local hospital, and for Healthcash, which
pays cash for in-patient stays, pregnancy and so on.
However, rates for BUPACare, the full medical insurance scheme used by 95
per cent of customers, will increase. Premiums for subscribers under 44 will
go up by less than 5 per cent and for those aged 45-59 by about 5 or 6 per
cent, but older customers will pay for the fact that the usage of policies
by their age group has increased significantly. Rates will increase by 12
per cent for customers aged 60-64; those over 65 face rises of between 10.5
and 11.5 per cent.
BUPA reviews its premiums twice a year. The new rates will apply to
customers renewing a policy in the six months from July. In 1991-92, rate
rises averaged 25 per cent. The figure for 1993 is less than 14 per cent.
Arthur Large, managing director of BUPA membership, said the slow-down in
price increases was the result of cost containment.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Executives need to reassess pensions
/ Review of the effect of a Budget bombshell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SHORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORMAN LAMONT, the former chancellor, dropped a small bombshell in this
year's Budget when he froze the earnings ceiling at Pounds 75,000 instead of
increasing it in line with the Retail Price Index.
This ceiling, known as the 'cap', means that only the first Pounds 75,000 of
an executive's earnings can be taken into account in arranging pension
benefits in an approved scheme (one which qualifies for full tax relief).
So his action in freezing the cap points to the need for executives to look
at other methods of boosting their benefits at retirement in respect of
their earnings above Pounds 75,000.
There are two courses available for executives - make additional pension
provision on a less tax efficient basis and/or make use of other tax
efficient savings vehicles to provide benefits at retirement.
Pension consultants have been devising schemes to provide additional
benefits every since the cap was introduced in April 1989. Basically, there
are two alternative routes that can be taken.
First, the benefits can be unfunded, that is the employer promises to pay
the benefits to the executive when he or she retires. Benefit entitlement
can be built up in the normal manner while the executive is still working
for the company and can be written into employment contracts. But
effectively, the executive is paid out of company profits at the time of
retirement.
An unfunded arrangement does not involve the employee in any tax liability
until the benefits are paid, when they are taxed - both income and cash sums
 -at the executive's top rate.
But there is no security in such arrangements. The executive is relying on
the company honouring the commitment at the time of retirement - there could
be problems if the company is under financial strain at the time or if
ownership has changed.
An unfunded arrangement is useful if the executive's earnings are not much
above the cap. When earnings greatly exceed the cap, executives want and
need the security provided by a funded arrangement, with the company paying
contributions in advance to provide the additional benefits - the Funded
Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme, known as Furbs.
There are different versions of Furbs, but all aim to mitigate the tax
disadvantages of an unapproved scheme - tax on the contributions, the
underlying funds being taxed and the benefits being taxed.
Under a Furbs, the employer's contributions are treated as a benefit in kind
to the executive and the executive is taxed accordingly. There is no way to
avoid this charge. Paid Furbs contributions do not give rise to an
additional National Insurance contribution charge on the employer.
If the Furbs is invested in the UK, then the underlying funds/securities
will be taxed accordingly. However, if the Furbs is set up offshore, then
the funds can roll up on a gross basis.
However, this benefit is mitigated through the fund having to pay
withholding taxes on overseas equity dividends - a tax that UK gross funds
can avoid and charges are far higher than for onshore exempt funds.
It is understood that the Inland Revenue is uneasy over offshore funds for
UK pension provision. This unease could be translated into legislation
against such funds.
Finally, with a Furbs, lump sum payments are tax free, but income payments
are taxable. Hence, executives would take the accumulated benefits on a
Furbs as cash and make their own arrangements about converting that capital
into income.
Executives seeking to get their company to arrange a Furbs should check on
the tax position and the charges being levied. It should be arranged through
an experienced consultant or adviser. Where possible, the executive should
ensure that any tax/NI contribution claims have been confirmed in writing by
the Inland Revenue and the Department of Social Security.
As stated, the cap's introduction has focused attention on other methods of
boosting benefits at retirement.
A personal equity plan is the first method to be considered. It is flexible
and tax efficient, except that contributions do not attract tax relief.
Share option and share incentive schemes are both useful vehicles enabling
executives to accumulate substantial cash sums on a flexible, tax efficient
basis in the form of ordinary shares of the company.
However, share option and share incentive schemes are only available to
those executives working for companies whose shares are quoted. And they
rely on steady growth in the share price and the dividend payouts.
Little has been done, however, to help the self-employed make contributions
towards their pension on earnings above the cap, without suffering the full
tax impact.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Easier Mercury access
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESIDENTIAL telephone users across much of the UK will soon be able to
access the Mercury network without buying new phones, under Mercury's new
'132' service.
Called 'easy access', users connected to the service will simply have to
prefix the number they wish to dial with '132' to route their call via
Mercury. The service is already available for London customers connected to
digital exchanges - about half of all users in the capital. Users in
Birmingham, Nottingham, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Oxford, and 17 other towns and
cities are also eligible as of now.
The annual connection fee is Pounds 10 (plus VAT). It takes about two days
to join; there is no need to adjust your existing phone(s).
As yet Mercury has barely publicised '132'. An advertising blitz is
scheduled for the autumn, by when just under half of existing BT residential
customers will be able to switch to Mercury via '132'.
Many long-distance and international calls are cheaper with Mercury, though
users should also watch out for BT special offers. A '132' connection does
not involve severing your existing BT link; indeed all calls not prefaced by
'132' will automatically be routed via BT.
Mercury's existing blue-button '131' service will run in parallel with '132'
and remain the only means of access for those not connected to digital
exchanges. However, from the end of the year manufacturers intend to start
marketing blue-button '132' phones, which will route '132' calls via Mercury
at the touch of one, instead of three, buttons.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST OF the attention on GEC's results on Wednesday will centre on how
generous the lumbering giant will be with the dividend. The City was
disappointed with the cautious 5 per cent rise at the half way stage;
optimists are looking for a 7 per cent advance in the second half of the
year.
Taxable profits are expected to be around the Pounds 860m mark for the year
to March and the cash mountain is expected to measure up at around Pounds
2bn, just over Pounds 1bn from the company itself and the remainder from
joint ventures.
Most of GEC's main lines - telecommunications, power systems and medical
systems are performing well. GEC may have had its share of criticism in the
1980s but analysts now take the view that its sober practices give it the
feel of a company for the 1990s.
ASDA, the UK grocery retailing chain, is expected to announce on Friday an
improved full-year profit of between Pounds 135m and Pounds 142m.
That would be a significant increase on last year's Pounds 86.8m before
exceptional write-offs of Pounds 451.6m, and in excess of the company's own
forecast of Pounds 130m given in January when it launched a Pounds 347m
rights issue to accelerate its recovery programme.
Analysts believe chief executive Archie Norman's strategy of a return to
keener pricing and the 'Asda price' promise, and a shake-up of
merchandising, buying and marketing, is bearing fruit.
They also believe Asda has continued to see like-for-like sales running
about 2 per cent ahead of the last financial year.
A final dividend of 1.1p is forecast, giving a total of 1.6p, down from 2.1p
last year.
Airtours, the holiday company, announces half-year results on Monday, June
28, with losses before exceptionals expected to be Pounds 7.5m, compared
with Pounds 5.6m last time. Holiday companies usually make a first-half loss
as they are already paying some of their summer season costs. A further
exceptional loss of Pounds 9.5m is likely, resulting from the failed bid for
Owners Abroad earlier this year.
Pre-tax profits of BPB Industries, Europe's biggest plasterboard producer,
are forecast to have risen to between Pounds 48 and Pounds 55m for the 12
months to the end of March when the group publishes its annual results on
Thursday.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: The best and worst share performers
 -Philip Coggan and Scheherazade Daneshkhu see some surprising falls from
grace in the first-half of the year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MUCH of the last decade, a good stock market adage was 'keep taking the
tablets.' Buying shares in pharmaceutical companies was what the Americans
call a no-brainer: a decision requiring little thought.
The rationale was that ageing populations in the West and increasingly
sophisticated medical techniques were leading to ever-rising healthcare
costs. The scale of research and development needed to produce new drugs
prevented companies from entering the market and led to high margins for
those that remained. As recently as 1991, Wellcome and Glaxo were the best
performing shares in the FT-SE 100 Index.
But in the first half of 1993, the no-brainers turned into no-gainers. Glaxo
and Wellcome were the worst performing FT-SE shares and other drugs related
stocks, such as Boots and Smithkline Beecham, also feature in the laggards
list.
The primary reason for the fall is the Clinton administration's plans to
reform the US healthcare system, which has hit pharmaceutical companies on
both sides of the Atlantic. Add some company-specific problems - worries
about Wellcome's anti-Aids drug, the departure of Glaxo's chief executive -
and you have the scope for a share price decline.
A more fundamental factor also came into play. As the UK economy recovers,
investors start to desert the solid, dependable stocks that saw them through
the recession and start to move into 'cyclical' shares. Profits of such
companies were battered by the recession and investors reason that the
rebound will therefore be all the sharper.
Many of the best performing FT-SE shares of the first half fall into the
'recovery' category. British Aerospace may have announced a Pounds 1.2bn
loss, but it paid a larger than expected dividend and showed signs of
rebounding from the disasters of last year, when its share price (now around
Pounds 4) touched 107p. It rejoined the FT-SE 100 index at the start of
June.
British Steel was due for a revival, having been one of the 10 worst
performing Footsie stocks in both 1991 and 1992. The first half share price
surge came in spite of the announcement of a Pounds 149m loss for the year
ended April 3, the company's worst result since privatisation in 1988.
The devaluation of the pound has improved the company's outlook, as has its
ability to announce, and maintain, price rises. But the shares, sought after
at privatisation for their dividend-paying ability, now yield just 1.2 per
cent.
Asda is another stock on the rebound. It performed so badly in 1991 that it
was dropped from the FT-SE 100 index, but last year its shares rose 50 per
cent and it has climbed back in. The supermarket group managed to be one of
the best performing shares of the first half in spite of a Pounds 347m
rights issue in January.
Smaller rather than larger companies have provided the best returns in the
first half. The FT-SE 100 index is up just 1.7 per cent over the period to
June 25; the All-Share has done little better, with a rise of 4.7 per cent.
The recently created FT Small Cap index, covering the smallest 450 stocks in
the All-Share, jumped a more than healthy 20.7 per cent.
Small company shares had underperformed for four consecutive years between
1989 and 1992 - their worst recorded run. The very factors that hurt them
during the recession - their exposure to the UK economy, the lack of
liquidity in the shares - are helping them in brighter economic times.
The tables show the best and worst performing stocks in the All-Share as
well as in the FT-SE 100 index. As with their larger brethren, many of these
are 'recovery' stocks.
Often, however, long-term shareholders may not have had that much cause for
cheer. Some of the companies merely regained ground lost in 1992.
Take the best performing stock, Baltic, a small leasing group, which saw its
share price rise from 26p on January 1 to 89p on Thursday night. This sounds
like good news for its shareholders until you realise that the price
plummeted last year from 123p to 24p in the space of seven months after
fears of bad debt provisions when it withdrew from construction equipment
leasing and aircraft financing.
By contrast, Danka business systems, the US-based office equipment supplier,
has seen rapid growth this year after a series of acquisitions. Pre-tax
profits were up by 63 per cent in the year to March 31 due to pent-up demand
for office equipment and the restructuring of many of its businesses.
Smith New Court, one of London's leading marketmakers, which this week
reported pre-tax profits up up 110 per cent on last year, has seen its share
price more than double in the first half of the year on the back of
increased turnover in the markets. The profits ensured a warm welcome for
its Pounds 41.2m rights issue on Thursday, with the share price rising 35p
to close at 285p at the end of the day.
A sudden spate of buying in Ratners, the heavily indebted jewellery group,
since April has led to a steep increase in the share price but analysts have
found it difficult to explain why the shares have become so popular.
There is less mystery behind the woes of Hartstone, the hosiery and leather
goods company, which saw its share price slide this year from 272p on
February 22 to 34p at Thursday's close. The company has been hit by the
deepening recession in Europe.
Other consumer goods companies to have done badly included Spring Ram, the
Yorkshire manufacturer of kitchens, bathrooms and home improvement products.
In March it announced a fall in last year's pre-tax profits to Pounds 26.2m,
well below expectations of Pounds 39m. The fall was attributed to difficult
trading conditions and the same factor was blamed by Campari, the sporting
leisure wear group, which in May made its second profits warning in less
than two months, and by Jeyes, the cleaning products group. Its profits
warning earlier this month caused the share price to fall 122p in one day to
317p and it now languishes at 283p.
Two companies in the engineering sector have suffered. BM group's troubles
began last summer when its share price collapsed after loss of confidence
following the resignation of Roger Shute, its founding chairman. It has been
involved in refinancing talks with its bankers after mounting debts and
losses.
Simon Engineering also had a bad year in 1992 and its problems have
continued. In March, the company announced that pre-tax profits fell from
Pounds 18.3m to Pounds 5.32m in the year to December, mainly due to the
recession and losses on a paper engineering contract. A profits warning in
May triggered further falls.
Where will the winners come in the second half? Michael Beggs, who manages a
recovery fund for Guinness Flight, argues that the first phase is over - a
fair amount of recovery is built into share prices and one can no longer
pick up stocks at bargain valuations. The next phase is to identify the
companies which have done the hard work of reorganisation and restructuring
and which will benefit from the economic recovery.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Markets: Tracking down the right investment - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SELECTING THE right equity fund from the myriad options available is a
tricky process. However hard you scrutinise the past performance, there is
no guarantee that funds at the top of the charts will continue to do well.
The sad fact is that the majority of funds fail to outperform the market
index. The odds are thus stacked against you and in favour of
underperformance.
Hence the emergence of index-tracking funds. These do not attempt to select
shares by the old analytical standbys. They simply try to match the index's
performance, normally by selecting stocks which have tracked it in the past.
Once set up, the costs of running an indexed fund ought to be lower than on
a conventional fund. Even so, there are inevitably some costs and these
prevent the funds from exactly matching the index's performance.
Nevertheless, the UK funds have performed well and in general have above
average performances for their sectors. The overseas tracking funds have not
done so well, particularly in Japan.
Conventional fund managers argue that they can still beat the index, and it
may well be that if the market moves sideways for the next year or so, the
emphasis will be on stock picking. Small companies may well be set to
outperform over the next year or so, which may help active managers.
Nevertheless, indexed funds may well be a good core holding for first-time
investors over the longer term. Here follows details of the main unit trusts
in the area; there is also a small number of tracker investment trusts -
Venturi, Malvern and two Hoare Govett small company funds.
(All figures are from Finstat and cover the longest period available to June
1. Growth is offer-to-bid with income reinvested, except where stated.
Details are also given of the minimum investment, charges and sector
position.)
UK: Gartmore's UK Index fund follows the All-Share. It has grown 29.9 per
cent over three years, placing it 9th out of 95 funds. Minimum Pounds 5,000;
charges nil initially, 0.5 per cent annually.
Govett has a large number of futures and options funds, including ones based
on the FT-SE 100 and others tracking European and US Indices. It also has a
conventional unit trust based on the new FT Mid-250 Index. This is up 40.5
pc (offer-to-offer) over nine months, placing it 9th out of 106 funds over
that period. Minimum investment is Pounds 3,000; charges are nil initially
and 1 pc annual.
James Capel's UK Index fund follows the All-Share. It has grown 26.5 pc over
three years, placing it 21st out of 95 funds. Minimum Pounds 1,000; charges
are 5.25 pc initial and 0.5 pc annual. Capel also has a Footsie fund which
tracks the FT-SE 100 index. It is up 4 pc (offer-to-offer) in six months,
putting it 104th out of 108. Minimum Pounds 1,000; charges 4.175 pc initial
and 1 pc annual.
The Trixie fund also from James Capel, covers companies in the smallest 12
pc of the All-Share. It has risen 0.7 pc over a year, placing it 53rd out of
67 funds in the smaller companies sector. Minimum Pounds 1,000; charges 5.25
pc initial, 1 pc annual.
The Midland FT-SE 100 fund is up 1.1 pc (offer-to-offer) over 3 months
placing it 88th out of 110. Minimum Pounds 1,000; charges 6 pc initial, 1.5
pc annual.
The Morgan Grenfell UK Equity index tracker follows the All-share. It has
grown 24.8 pc over three years, placing it 33rd out of 95. Minimum Pounds
1,000; charges 5 pc initial and 0.75 pc annual. Norwich UK Index Tracking
follows the All-Share and has grown 26.7 pc over three years, placing it
20th out of 95. Minimum Pounds 5,000; charges 6 pc initial, 0.2 pc annual.
Providence Capitol All-Share Mirror has grown 3.8 pc over a year, placing it
40th out of 104 funds over that period. Minimum Pounds 500; charges 2.04 pc
initial and 0.5 pc annual. Royal Life's UK Index Tracking Trust follows the
All-Share. The fund has risen 26.3 pc over three years, placing it 23rd out
of 95 funds. Minimum is a hefty Pounds 25,000; charges 5.25 pc initial and
0.3 pc annual.
Swiss Life's UK Index Tracker fund follows the All-Share. It has risen 31.3
pc over three years, placing it sixth out of 95 funds. Minimum is 500 units
(currently around Pounds 600-Pounds 700); charges 6 pc initial and 0.5 pc
annual.
US: James Capel's American Index Fund follows the S&amp;P 500. The fund has
grown 30.5 pc over three years, placing it 74th out of 113 funds over that
period. Minimum Pounds 1,000; charges 5.25 pc initial and 1 pc annual.
Legal &amp; General's US index fund follows the FT-A World Index (US). It has
risen 1 pc (offer-to-offer) over the six months to June 1, placing it 96th
out of 127 funds. Minimum Pounds 1,000; charges 5 pc initial, 0.75 pc
annual.
The Morgan Grenfell US Equity Index Tracker follows the S&amp;P 500. It has
grown 32.6 pc over the three years to June 1, placing it 67th out of 113
funds. Minimum Pounds 1,000; charges 5 pc initial and 0.75 pc annual.
Japan: All the trusts in this market follow the FT-A World Japan index.
James Capel's Japan Index has risen 1.6 pc over the three years to June 1,
placing it 50th out of 78 funds. Minimum Pounds 1,000; charges 5.25 pc
initial and 0.5 pc annual.
Legal &amp; General's Japan index tracker trust is up 1.5 per cent over three
years, and is 51st out of 78. Minimum Pounds 1,000; charges 5 pc initial,
0.75 pc annual. Morgan Grenfell's Japan Tracker trust has fallen 2.7 pc over
three years and is 60th out of 78. Minimum Pounds 1,000; charges 5 pc
initial and 0.75 pc annual.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Income distribution survey - At a
glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Income distributions from income unit trusts have tended to be lower in the
first half of this year, according to Income Fund Analysis. Of 119 funds
which have paid at least one half yearly or two quarterly income
distributions in 1993 so far, 68 paid less than the same time last year, 14
were unchanged, and 37 made higher payments.
Of 79 distributions paid in April, May and June this year, 41 were down on
the equivalent payment last year, nine were unchanged, and 29 were up. Four
long-running funds monitored by IFA have already secured their unbroken
records of increasing income every year since 1981: Prolific High Income,
Kleinwort Benson High Yield, Barclays Unicorn Income, and Allied Dunbar
Equity Income. Four others have so far held steady, and may increase in the
second half of 1993: Henderson Income &amp; Growth, M&amp;G High Income, Sun Life
Distribution, and James Capel Income Fund. (Further details from IFA on 0492
875410).

FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: American Express security quiz - At
a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
American Express will be introducing an anti-fraud precaution on its credit
cards later this year aimed at preventing the use of cards which are
intercepted in the post.
When the owner of an Amex card receives it, they will have to telephone an
0800 number within 20 days and answer a number of security questions to
verify their identity. The card can then be used. If the card is used before
the owner has received it and done the security check, the fraudster will be
called to the telephone to answer a series of identification questions.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Unit trusts funds continue to climb
 -At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unit trusts continued to attract investors in May, as funds under management
rose for the fourth month running to reach another record high of Pounds
73.8bn, up 22 per cent on May 1992. There were 4.59m account holders, up 4
per cent on the year. Total net sales in May were Pounds 914m, up almost 300
per cent on May last year.
Interest in UK equity unit trusts by private investors has shown a
particularly dramatic increase this year, according to figures from the
Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds. Retail sales - made
directly to private investors or through intermediaries - of unit trusts
invested in UK equities were Pounds 1,211m in the first five months of this
year, compared with Pounds 140.7m in the same period of 1992.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Markets: Charter free to start spending - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHARTER Consolidated is free at last
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
although the UK industrial group needed more than one bound to achieve
independence from Anglo American Corporation, the South African mining
group.
Charter took the biggest step in February by selling its 38 per cent holding
in Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group, which is
part of the Anglo American 'family' of companies.
Jeff Herbert, Charter's chief executive, completed the process this week by
announcing plans to buy out the 36 per cent stake in his company held by
Minorco, Anglo American's Luxembourg-based investment company.
After receiving Pounds 342m for the Johnson Matthey stake and paying Minorco
Pounds 236m for its own shares, Charter will be left with about Pounds 200m
in net cash, borrowing facilities of Pounds 300m and the ability to issue
its own paper. What will the group do with its new-found freedom, apart from
dropping the 'Consolidated' from Charter's title?
Herbert is keen to build by acquisition. He says there could be 'one big
hit' in the Pounds 500m range, but it seems much more likely that the group
will make a series of smaller purchases in areas close to its present
businesses.
Charter's existing operations - rail and mining equipment; building
products; quarrying and mining - reported an 11 per cent increase in
operating profits in what the group described as 'a very difficult year when
many of our competitors struggled to stand still.'
In spite of the depressed trading conditions Herbert is confident there are
good buying opportunities 'partly because of how we run our businesses,
partly because some sectors are now moving ahead.'
The group will favour UK-based companies with an international spread of
businesses. As a former director of GEC and Jaguar Rover Triumph, Herbert
admits: 'My natural background is making things.'
Charter would like to increase its exposure to Continental Europe, which
currently accounts for only 15 per cent of group sales, and is also
interested in the opportunities offered by the Far East and Eastern Europe.
However, the group has little track record in making acquisitions and is
thought in the City to have overpaid for its last big deal, by spending
Pounds 54m for the Hargreaves quarries operations in 1989.
Herbert remains confident of being able to make earnings-enhancing
acquisitions, even although the market as a whole is on a high rating: 'Some
prices are still unrealistic, but pain does tell. There are people out there
who are really hurting.'
It should be relatively easy for Charter to buy companies which offer a
better return than cash in the bank, thus increasing group earnings. But
unless a rising share price maintains Charter's rating, it will subsequently
become more difficult for the group to issue paper without diluting
earnings.
It is not easy to arrive at a fundamental valuation of the new-look Charter.
Its shares are currently trading on a multiple of 17.5, a 20 per cent
premium to the market that reflects the amount of cash in the group. But
analysts estimate that the group's underlying business should probably be on
a prospective multiple of about 12.5, a 14 per cent discount.
Just how the shares perform is therefore likely to depend on both the speed
and success of Charter's acquisition plans. The shares rose from 634p to
648p when the deal was announced on Wednesday, but fell back a little to
close the week at 639p.
Analysts feel the existing operations are unlikely to sparkle, although the
Cape building materials business did well to increase operating profits by 5
per cent and has considerable recovery potential.
Investing in the shares really comes down to backing the judgment of Herbert
and his team. They are acknowledged as good managers and have some solid
businesses, such as the Anderson mining equipment operation. Charter looks
an interesting long-term bet for those attracted to less glamorous
industrial stocks.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Markets: Concerned consumers worry the brokers - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK markets are approaching the second quarter reporting season with
trepidation.
This might seem odd, since most economists on Wall Street agree that
economic growth between April and June will prove to have been healthier
than during the previous three months, when gross domestic product grew by a
miserly 0.7 per cent.
Yet, if recent profits warnings are to be believed, the (admittedly modest)
improvement in underlying economic conditions during the second quarter will
not have translated into a widespread improvement in corporate
profitability.
Over the past two weeks companies representing a broad cross-section of
business have announced that their second quarter profits will not match
market expectations. Among the bigger names warning of poor earnings were
Kmart, Nike, Reebok, American Airlines, USAir, Minnesota Mining &amp;
Manufacturing, Apple Computer and Chemical Waste Management.
Investors are so jittery about corporate earnings that even companies whose
earnings are holding up have suffered at the hands of the edgy markets. This
week Caterpillar stock dived briefly on reports that the company had
indicated its overseas sales were weak. Caterpillar denied the reports.
Earlier, similar rumours struck Hewlett-Packard shares, even though the
computer group insisted it remained upbeat about its prospects.
While there has been a smattering of positive corporate news lately -
Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber predicted on Thursday that its second quarter income
would be better than analysts' forecasts - there has not been enough to rid
the markets' nagging concerns that the coming reporting season will prove a
disappointment.
Recent economic reports have been equally discouraging. This week saw a big
drop in May durable goods orders, unexpected weakness in mid-June car sales,
the downward revision in first quarter GDP numbers, and a Federal Reserve
survey (the 'Beige Book') which reported only moderate economic growth and
forecast that business activity would probably slow.
The news from the political arena was not particularly helpful, either. The
Clinton tax-raising, expenditure-cutting, deficit-reducing economic package
may have squeaked through the Senate on Thursday night, but investors were
not necessarily overjoyed at the President's good fortune.
While the bond markets like Clinton's economic measures because they are
seen as an attempt to shrink the federal deficit, the stock markets worry
that higher taxes and lower government spending will undermine an already
fragile economy.
Thus, over the next few weeks investors face the prospect of a muted
economic recovery and less-than-sparkling second quarter corporate earnings.
If the economy and earnings fail to catch up with the optimistic
expectations that have been built into share prices, then the markets will
have to give back some of the gains earned earlier this year.
Yet stocks have been holding their ground. At around 3,490, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average is still within 70 points, or 2 per cent, of its all-time
high, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index is also within a couple of
percentage points of its record.
This resilience is primarily a reflection of continued huge flows of
investor cash into equities (much of it via the booming mutual fund
industry) and hopes that low interest rates will fuel the market, and the
economy, for the rest of the year. These two factors are inextricably
linked, because investors are shifting large amounts of money into stocks
because low interest rates are destroying the returns they earn on
short-term assets like money market funds and bank certificates of deposit.
So long as rates remain low, that money will keep rolling into equities.
And rates remain extremely low. Earlier this year the yield on the 30-year
government bond was above 7 per cent. This week, thanks to encouraging
inflation data, the 30-year yield dropped to 6.72 per cent, close to its
all-time low.
Low interest rates, however, are not enough to sustain corporate America.
Companies' borrowing costs may have been lightened because of the easing in
credit conditions, but domestic demand has proved worryingly fickle.
Fearful of unemployment, unhappy about the prospect of higher taxes, and
pessimistic over the economic outlook, consumers are retreating. This
explains many of the recent profits warnings. Clothing sales have been poor
at Kmart, too many Nike and Reebok sportshoes remain on the shelves, and
seats are empty on American and USAir. People are not spending, and the
markets are worried.

Internal Memorandum
From: the Governor
To: the Governor-elect
Dear Eddie,
I thought I would just jot down a few notes to help you with the handover
this week. I wouldn't want all my good work over the past 10 years to be
wasted because you couldn't unlock the filing cabinet.
Inflation
Getting inflation down has been my top priority since I first sat at this
desk on July 1 1983. Although I say it myself, I have done rather well,
though those politicians keep trying to take the credit. Perhaps that is an
argument for an independent central bank.
Now, don't you go messing it up. Promising to take a pay freeze yourself was
a good wheeze - and an incentive to keep the screws on - and keeping the Jag
rather than taking the new Roller was another, although your successor might
not like the precedent.
Above all else, don't let base rates come down too soon. You saw how the
stock market got worked up on Monday at the thought of a rate cut - up 24
points on the day and through 2,900 again.
One good thing about Lamont's resignation speech: he blew the whistle on
political interest rate cuts, so you ought to be able to fend off Downing
Street for a while. Clarke was sounding a bit more reasonable in that
interview, but don't trust 'em is my advice.
Currencies
Afraid I'm handing over to you at a rather busy time, with the European
currencies all over the place. That bust-up between our friends in Germany
and France has really stirred things up. My advice is to keep your head down
and let them fight it out. And if sterling appreciates a bit against the
D-Mark, never mind - it will all help on the inflation front.
The economy
Some better news on this one. I am really quite optimistic that the recovery
is getting going. Those first-quarter GDP figures on Tuesday, showing an
upward revision from the provisional number to +0.9 per cent (excluding oil
and gas), are encouraging. My main concern is that recession in Europe could
drag our economy back down again later in the year. But exports have been
doing rather well. So, you can use that as further evidence that an interest
rate cut isn't necessary.
The Budget deficit
I wouldn't presume to give you any advice about funding; after all, you've
been telling me how to do it for years. Seems to me it's going pretty well
so far this year, with another auction coming up on Wednesday, despite the
size of the deficit. Of course, there's BT3 as well. And after Warburg's
success with the Zeneca rights issue this week - 86 per cent take-up, not
bad - it ought to get away.
But whenever you're talking to the politicians, do remind them that funding
is one thing but the real solution is to cut the deficit. We just can't go
on living beyond our means like this. Clarke's hints that taxes could go up
aren't enough in my view. They've really got to cut benefits - so long as
the current generation of pensioners is protected.
Corporate sector
Company finances are better than they have been for years. Borrowing is at a
five-year low, according to the statistics put out this week; and, with a
bit of luck, the corporate sector should move into a cash-flow surplus this
year. But mind your eye, is my advice. There are still a lot of difficult
situations around with heavily-borrowed companies - the ones that were in
too much of a mess to have rights issues. We should know whether Gerald
Ronson's Heron outfit has got its creditors on-side this week, but you might
still have to do a bit of nudging on that one.
That Spring Ram episode was a bit nasty, too, and it's not as though it is
the only company recently to issue two profit warnings in as many months. I
sometimes wonder if these companies have any idea what's going on in their
businesses. How different from life at the Bank.
Another potential problem that needs to be headed off is how companies are
going to finance the recovery once it gets moving. The banks have suffered
so badly in the recession that they can't lend too much risk capital. You
need to find a way to let their profits recover - let lending margins widen
somehow - but this is a really tricky one, politically. I'm sure you
understand my concern as a former, and perhaps future, clearing banker.
The stock market
I fear that the market is getting a bit frothy, although it had settled down
again by the end of the week. Some of the brokers have been pushing up their
forecasts for the Footsie at the year-end on the hopes of faster earnings
growth than they had thought. I'd feel a bit easier if they would wait for
some firmer evidence first.
The stock exchange
You need to keep a watchful eye on the chaps at the Tower, too. Everything's
been going wrong lately, what with the Taurus mess and all. They seem to be
getting a bit lax about company announcements, as well. Did you notice the
way shares in Rothmans and Dunhill jumped on Tuesday when their controlling
shareholder, Richemont, said it was going to re-organise the businesses? The
exchange really should have made sure that announcement came out after the
market closed, or else suspended the shares first. The EBRD
Oh dear. Jacques Attali's resignation throws that up in the air - and after
all the trouble we took to make sure the blessed bank came to London. Try to
use your influence to get a sensible replacement.
Well, that's about everything I think. I've left the keys in the top
right-hand drawer. Remember, if you can stick it out without too many
disasters, you collect the peerage at the end. And, as the man said, don't
let the b*****s get you down.
Hope to see you down at Dunguvnin sometime.

<TEXT>
AS ROBIN Leigh-Pemberton retires to his Kent estate after 10 years at the
Bank of England, he can reflect with satisfaction on the enhanced status of
his institution. The BCCI scandal seems to have been brushed aside, and a
real discussion is going on about whether the Bank should be granted
independent control over monetary policy.
Perhaps in future the governor will no longer be a remote City of London
grandee, making speeches carefully overlaid with impenetrable waffle and
stripped by the Treasury of all controversy, but will acquire a clear,
anti-inflationary mission for which he is directly answerable to parliament.
How things have changed in 10 years. Leigh-Pemberton's predecessor, Gordon
Richardson, carried greater clout as a central banker but independence was
not on the agenda. Of course, this may only reflect the difference between
Margaret Thatcher and John Major. In any case, the swing of the pendulum
back to the Bank simply reflects the fact that the Treasury has become such
a disaster area. In the mid-1980s, the Bank was regarded with contempt by
Whitehall, not least because of regulatory upsets such as Johnson Matthey
Bankers. Now, the Treasury is licking its own wounds.
But the news from Frankfurt, home of that doyen of independent central
banks, the Bundesbank, is discouraging. Making only tiny concessions on
interest rates this week, the Bundesbank continues to slug out a grim battle
with the free-spending federal government amid the wreckage of the German
economy. The Law of Misplaced Credibility states that economic concepts
reach their greatest level of popularity just when they are about to hit
trouble. Countries like the UK, Spain, Sweden and Portugal flocked to join
or track the European exchange rate mechanism just when it was starting to
choke on its own internal contradictions and newly-acquired rigidity. So it
appears to be with the idea of central bank independence.
There is an intoxicating appeal in an off-the-shelf formula that might solve
deep-rooted problems. The ERM seemed so attractive to the British government
three years ago because it would permit cuts in interest rates ahead of the
next election while exerting a magic spell over the British economy,
encouraging adjustment to a low inflation rate. Now, the Bank of England may
be offered the tarnished magic wand.
One argument is that the government will be forced to follow
non-inflationary policies because of the influence of the Bank: interest
rate cuts will not be possible ahead of an election, for instance. But it is
also possible that, for a while, the government will be able to follow more
dangerous fiscal policies because of the financial markets' exaggerated
faith in the central banks' powers. At least, this is how it has been
working out in Germany recently, although the magic is dissipating and
French franc interest rates are slipping below those of the D-Mark.
In fact, any anti-inflationary strategy requires more than money market
manipulation  - it needs a degree of consensus throughout society.
Sometimes, inflation is the best solution, and it would be dangerous to
block it. In a low inflation environment, prices must be flexible downwards
as well as upwards and, if they are not, disaster may ensue: inflexible
wages have led to massive unemployment in the UK, and excessive mortgage
borrowing has led to ruin for more than 1m home owners, not to mention
serious losses for financial institutions. Nigel Lawson tried to manage the
British economy on the basis of interest rates alone, and the Bank of
England would be unwise to emulate him.
Actually, Leigh-Pemberton's anti-inflationary record is not that bad, judged
by the standards of several predecessors. He took over in July 1983 when
headline inflation happened to be an erratically low 3.5 per cent, and it
has averaged 5.2 per cent a year since. Perhaps that is an undeservedly low
figure when broad money growth has averaged an extraordinary 12.5 per cent
annually with M4 more than tripling within the decade; the Bundesbank would
have been appalled.
Certainly, there has been no swindling of savers under Leigh-Pemberton.
Short-term depositors have done well, perhaps too well, with money market
returns averaging 11.1 per cent before tax and holders of gilt-edged
enjoying average returns of 11.8 per cent, nearly twice the rate of
inflation. That was not especially expensive for the government given that
the total net public sector borrowing requirement for the decade was only
Pounds 64bn, scarcely more than Kenneth Clarke will be borrowing in 1993-94
alone. Since mid-1983, net public sector indebtedness has shrunk from 45 to
30 per cent of GDP. How different the trend will be in the rest of the
1990s.
Now, however, Eddie George will have to preside over a period in which real
interest rates are likely to decline and in which a still-bloated banking
system will be forced to shrink. This will sorely test the Bank's sense of
priorities. Already, it is troubled by conflicting objectives. The BCCI
affair suggested that its concerns with polishing the City of London's image
clashed with its responsibilities for protecting depositors; and, in the
end, the ERM strategy threatened to undermine the solvency of the banking
industry.
Attitudes may have to change. This week, the new deputy governor, Rupert
Pennant-Rea, remarked on what he had learned in two months at the Bank about
traditional central bankerly behaviour. He discovered that if his son were
to ask him what 5x12 made, his reply should be: 'It all depends.'
'Obfuscation,' he added, 'is altogether too precise a term for what central
bankers do.' But a good one-liner will wear very thin if the Bank of England
accepts new responsibilities without understanding how to handle the higher
political profile which will accompany them. The Old Lady may yet turn into
an Aunt Sally.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Calling Dr Dalek - your patient is waiting: A revolution in
surgery where robots are taking an increased role in the operating theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU ARE about to have the anaesthetic before an operation to remove a brain
tumour. Would you feel happier knowing that the most delicate part of the
procedure was to be carried out by the gently trembling hand of the world's
most skilful surgeon - or by a rock-steady robot? That question will soon be
more than a fantasy because surgery is in the early stages of a technical
revolution. The first step has been the spread of 'keyhole' operations over
the past five years. Instead of cutting open the patient, the surgeon uses
instruments guided by telescope through tiny incisions. Soon, it will be
possible to work by remote control on patients thousands of miles away,
using a combination of telecommunications and virtual reality.
The most striking sign of change, though, is the way surgeons are starting
to welcome robotic assistants into their operating theatres. Within the past
few months, robots have helped to carry out hip replacements in California,
prostate operations in London and brain surgery in Grenoble, France. Later
this year, gall bladder removal, hernia repair and a variety of other
abdominal operations will be added to the list of robotic accomplishments.
Despite this, even the most enthusiastic surgeons say it is likely to be
several years before they would consider leaving a robot to operate on its
own.
The late Hap Paul, chief inventor of California's Robodoc, cautioned: 'We
have to move very slowly and carefully because one false move by a surgical
robot - and this whole technology is set back by many years.' Robodoc is the
world's largest and best-financed project in medical robotics. Since
November, 10 patients at Sutter general hospital in Sacramento have had hip
replacements with the aid of Robodoc, a 250 lb automaton programmed to carve
the cavity for an implant in the thigh bone.
Although Paul died two months ago (at only 44), Integrated Surgical Systems,
the company he founded with financial and scientific backing from IBM, is
forging ahead. It is waiting for approval from the Food and Drug
Administration to carry out a clinical trial of Robodoc with 300 patients in
three US hospitals.
Why should a patient trust a robotic tool rather than the skilled hands of a
human specialist? The most important reason is that an electronic arm is
capable of precision well beyond that of the steadiest and best-trained
surgeon. ISS hopes to prove this through its trial, in which patients will
be allocated at random into one group treated by Robodoc and another
receiving conventional hip replacements.
Surgical robots promise more than improvements in existing procedures, says
Patrick Finlay, managing director of Armstrong Projects, a fledgling UK
medical robotics company based at Beaconsfield near London. 'The reduced
collateral damage and greater precision of the robot will make it possible
to do operations that would otherwise be too risky to contemplate. For
example, a tumour very close to the optic nerve can be tackled without
making the patient blind.'
Several different types of surgical robot are under development around the
world. Robodoc is an 'active' robot that actually cuts human tissue.
'Orthopaedic work is an attractive application because the robot is working
on hard tissue that doesn't move if you prod it,' notes Brian Davies, an
engineer specialising in medical robotics at Imperial College, London.
Most operations, however, involve cutting soft tissues - a task that is more
delicate than carving bone. So far, only 'passive' robots have been used for
this type of surgery. They may move instruments inside the patient, under
the surgeon's direction, but they do not yet wield a scalpel or laser beam.
An example is Laparobot, which Armstrong Projects is developing with Mark
Ornstein, a surgeon at the London Clinic. Laparobot will give someone
carrying out keyhole surgery the impression of 'walking around' inside the
patient's body, using tele-presence techniques. A keyhole surgeon views the
operating site with a miniature video camera at the end of a thin optical
tube, inserted into the body through a puncture hole (typically, in the
tummy button). This instrument, called a laparoscope, projects the scene on
to a TV screen above the patient.
Normally, an assistant has to hold the laparoscope and move it when the
surgeon needs a different view. But Laparobot itself senses the position of
the surgeon's head and moves the image accordingly. If the surgeon pushes a
foot button and moves his head to the left, the robot will change the view
inside the patient's body. For this year's initial trials at the London
Clinic, Laparobot will work with an existing TV monitor - but the next stage
will be for the surgeon to wear a helmet-mounted display which will give the
impression of being immersed in the operating environment. As he looks
around, the scene will change as though he were actually inside the
abdominal cavity.
Further in the future lies the prospect of linking the surgeon's finger
movements to the control of micro-instruments within the body. 'Laparobot
will make the surgery more efficient - less stressful for the surgeon,
faster and more accurate, and with less risk of damage to the patient,' says
Ornstein.
Armstrong is also working with Professor David Thomas, of London's National
Hospital for Neurology, to develop Neurobot, a system for carrying out brain
surgery. By the end of this year, they hope to have demonstrated an
'image-guided robot' that will help the surgeon position his instruments at
the correct point in the brain to perform the operation. The next stage will
be for Neurobot itself to insert the instruments.
A surgical robot is given as much prior information as possible about
relevant parts of the patient's body - usually, from a CT or MRI scan. Its
computer converts this into a digital model of the patient. Although the
surgeon works out in advance the path of the operation, based on the
computer model, the system must be flexible enough to respond to unexpected
events.
Neurobot, for example, will have a sensor inside the patient's head. If it
detects the presence of an unexpected blood vessel, it will prompt the
surgeon for advice. Its software might propose a modified route, taking the
new information into account, but the robot will not go ahead until the
surgeon has signalled his approval.
Finlay says a good indicator of progress in surgical robotics will be the
increasing amount of freedom given to the robot. 'Although the surgeon will
never cease to participate, it is realistic to envisage a situation similar
to the relationship between an airliner captain and his autopilot, in which
the human provides a supervisory and monitoring role and is available to
take over the critical manoeuvres,' he says.
The consultant need not be in the operating theatre with the patient. In
tele-surgery projects under way in the US and France, an experienced surgeon
uses a video link to supervise a junior doctor in a hospital hundreds of
miles away. The surgeon could equally well supervise a distant robot,
although local medical and nursing staff would still have to be present in
case the system crashed.
Everyone involved in medical robotics is obsessed with safety. Yet, as
Davies points out, there are no agreed safety standards for robots operating
on people, whereas regulations require industrial robots to work in metal
cages. (The fact that two workers in Japan have been killed by factory
robots going out of control shows the need for such rules).
'There are two views on safety,' says Davies. 'One is that it's acceptable
to start out with an industrial robot provided you put in a top-level
software system to bring the thing to a halt in the event of some failure.
But, in my view, that's not safe enough. I think you need to re-develop the
robot from the basic servo level upwards, building in safety at every
level.'
That means giving the surgical robot the equivalent of a metal cage, with
duplicated software and hardware constraints to prevent it moving beyond
pre-defined limits. And it must move slowly enough for the supervising
surgeon's hand to hit the stop button in time to avoid damage if all the
safety systems fail. Demonstrating safety is not enough, though. Growing
concerns about the financial costs of medical care are forcing both public
health authorities and private hospitals to demand evidence that new
technology will deliver benefits that outweigh its expense.
Drugs have long had to justify their effectiveness in large-scale clinical
trials but, until now, new surgical procedures and medical equipment have
been introduced with remarkably little systematic assessment. A report on
medical research earlier this year by the UK government's Advisory Council
on Science and Technology (Acost) pointed out: 'With the exception of
pharmaceuticals, demands for evaluation have been questioned because it
'stands to reason' that the new techniques will be 'better'.'
Peter Doyle, research director of ICI and chairman of Acost's medical
research committee, gives keyhole surgery as an example of a procedure that
has been introduced 'haphazardly' without proper evaluation. The report says
the National Health Service should require all new medical devices to be
assessed under controlled conditions, and their cost effectiveness measured.
Miles Irving, professor of surgery at Manchester University's Hope Hospital,
says that such assessment is all the more necessary 'because surgeons face
strong consumer pressure to introduce new procedures before they have been
properly evaluated.'
Hap Paul felt that pressure when he was looking for sites to test Robodoc.
'Tertiary care centres in the US - the big university hospitals - see this
as an advance that will help them attract patients,' he said. 'So, we have
to be very careful in choosing our sites, to make sure it's not just a
publicity stunt for them.'
Indeed, says John Hutton, a health economist at York University, US
experience shows that patients regard hi-tech equipment in itself as an
indicator of quality, whether or not there is any clinical evidence to prove
its superiority. Therefore, hospitals compete by buying more and more flashy
machines - and their charges shoot up far faster than inflation. The
introduction of an internal market in the NHS is likely to lead to similar
competitive pressures in the UK.
ISS believes its clinical trial will enable orthopaedic hospitals to justify
buying a Dollars 750,000 Robodoc, doing 400 hip replacements a year, on the
basis that implants from robotic operations last longer than those inserted
manually and so save money in the long run. But the recent history of
medical research and technology, from antibiotics to diagnostic scanners,
shows that while each development can be justified in isolation as being
cost-effective, the overall result is to add substantially to the financial
burden of health care by creating new demand from patients and adding to the
number of elderly people in the population.
Two decades from now, only second-class patients will choose to have a
purely manual operation. But, in contrast to labour-saving robots in a car
factory, surgical robots can only make the process more expensive.
Enthusiastic medical technologists can answer any question except one: how
will we pay for it?

FT  26 JUN 93 / Customs aims to hit Channel smugglers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH CUSTOMS officials are planning a big crackdown on cross-Channel
bootleggers.
Officers from the investigation division of HM Customs &amp; Excise are
preparing raids in the next few weeks on up to seven teams of professional
smugglers it has identified as a result of surveillance and
intelligence-gathering.
The action follows two raids in recent weeks that led to the seizure of up
to Pounds 100,000 in goods and questioning of 18 individuals.
Officials will also lobby the authorities to revoke the alcohol licences of
any shops and pubs caught accepting goods on which no duty has been paid.
Two men charged with evading duty on 11 tons of cans and bottles of beer
were remanded until July 9 at Thames court, east London, yesterday after the
first successful prosecution of an evader last month.
Up to the end of May, 24 cases had led to arrests and charges concerning
goods worth Pounds 142,000; 243 were proceeding to prosecution or fines on
goods worth Pounds 419,000; and 175 cases involving goods totalling Pounds
18,409 had been dealt with simply through seizure.
The actions reflect a shift of Customs resources from border controls
towards greater use of intelligence to detect likely duty evaders.
Since the start of the year, anyone is entitled to import 'reasonable
quantities' of alcohol and tobacco for personal use. Customs officers
believe that relatively little systematic smuggling has taken place.
Mr Tim Hampson of the Brewers' Society called the removal of restrictions
for personal use 'a bootleggers' charter' that was affecting the trade of
brewers, pubs and off-licences around the country, particularly in the
south-east.
Customs argues that lifting the personal restrictions will reduce excise
duties by about Pounds 250m a year.

</HEADLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, effectively told his French
counterpart, Mr Edmond Alphandery, yesterday to mind his own business: the
Bonn government did not need outside advice, and German monetary policy was
a matter for the Bundesbank alone.
He was responding to a broadcast in which Mr Alphandery claimed he had
called a meeting in Paris for yesterday to discuss concerted action on
interest rates. Mr Alphandery said the Bundesbank should move faster to
relax its 'unduly restrictive' monetary policy.
Mr Alphandery said: 'We are going to speak equal to equal . . . That was not
the case a few months ago . . . Today the franc can support itself, perhaps
better than the D-Mark.'
Mr Waigel, blaming pressure of work, instantly cancelled what his officials
called a 'routine' quarterly meeting of the Franco-German economic and
finance council. Yesterday he aired his riposte in a radio interview.
Mr Waigel said the Germans knew exactly what was required and what was
possible. The view from Frankfurt and Bonn is that the fledgling French
minister's statements on Thursday were clumsy and undiplomatic.
There would 'certainly' be no collaborative reductions in interest rates, he
said.
The government was doing 'precisely what is necessary to provide the
Bundesbank with room to manoeuvre' in preparing cuts to reduce
public-spending deficits, which the Bundesbank considers essential before it
can consider further interest rate reductions.
It was certainly desirable that that interest rate cuts should be possible
in a period of recession, Mr Waigel said. He said German long-term rates
were at their lowest for three years.
He and Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, who was also due to
attend the cancelled meeting, had repeatedly emphasised how important it was
for other countries to make the most of any latitude.
France now has official short-term rates below those in Germany for the
first time since the late 1960s.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Lloyds wants to be able to disclose account details: Bank
seeks right of reply to customers' criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS BANK is pressing to be allowed to disclose details of the accounts of
its customers who complain to newspapers about how they have been treated,
without first having to obtain the customers' written permission.
Lloyds wants all banks to be allowed to respond to public criticism by
discussing details of their customers' accounts with journalists. The call
is in response to the wave of criticism of banks over the past two years.
The suggestion is among a series made by Lloyds to the review committee
headed by Sir George Blunden, the former deputy governor of the Bank of
England, which is reviewing the voluntary code of practice governing their
behaviour.
Lloyds has suggested in a confidential submission to the British Bankers'
Association that all banks should be able to discuss relevant details of
customers' accounts.
The code, introduced in March 1992 as a system of voluntary regulation,
currently imposes a 'strict duty of confidentiality' on banks. Lloyds
believes this prevents it from replying sensibly to many public criticisms.
It has suggested the code should clarify the maximum for which customers are
liable in cases of 'phantom' withdrawals from cash machines. At the moment,
banks can charge Pounds 50 for each withdrawal or in total.
Among suggestions made by the bank for the revision of the code, due to come
into force next March, are:
Banks should provide for customers on request details of how interest
charges on overdrafts have been calculated, and how it has worked out the
amount of interest credited to interest-bearing current accounts.
Lloyds believes this would replace services offered by small companies which
have developed software for customers to calculate the charges and interest
applied to their accounts and check for banks' mistakes. Banks should have a
united policy for the disclosure of full details about customer accounts to
credit reference agencies.
Lloyds also believes the code should define more closely the 'express
consent' which is required from customers before banks can distribute to
their insurance and product sales arms data about current accounts.
The review committee is expected to report on the current working of the
code of practice next month. Lloyds declined to comment on its submission.

FT  26 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: London International
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After London International's earlier indiscretions, its annual results
yesterday held little surprise, except possibly that the photo-processing
business has done even worse in the second half than most expected. Nor,
having been rebuked by the stock exchange, is the company giving much away
about the extent of likely recovery this year. The absence of restructuring
charges should stem the outflow of cash, but LIG will need more than that to
reduce its 105 per cent gearing.
That may eventually require the sale of the photo business which has proved
too vulnerable to the cycle for a company of this size. Without that
division, the company would be left with health-care business generating a
high-return but offering limited growth prospects given the modest expansion
of the world condom market, LIG's wide margins and its high market share in
many countries.
How that question will be addressed is a matter for the longer term. For
now, much depends on photo-processing which is a matter of the weather as
much as the economy. Judging by the way some are inclined to interpret the
new insider trading legislation, the stock exchange might have to pay close
attention to who is receiving long-range weather forecasts from Mr Michael
Fish. It would help prevent another communications upset, though, if LIG
were to issue a timely statement about the summer photo business at the
latest by its annual meeting in September.

FT  26 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: David S Smith
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David S Smith has negotiated the recession like a traveller crossing a
river, hopping from stepping stone to stepping stone. While profits from
Smith's cyclical paper division have collapsed from Pounds 15m to next to
nothing, the Pounds 24m contribution from the Kayserberg acquisition has
kept it moving nicely ahead. With recession in continental Europe now
lapping around Kayserberg, Smith has leapt again in buying Spicers for
Pounds 95m. Its contribution, combined with strengthening UK paper demand,
should save Smith again this year. With the Kemsley mill likely to prove its
worth by mid-decade, Smith's growth prospects will be considerably enhanced.
After months of disappointment, its shares have some room to run.
The Spicers acquisition, though, is not without worries. The company's foray
into France has proved disastrous. It may take much time and effort to
disentangle. The growing power of stationery retailers also poses a long
term threat to Spicers' wholesaling market. A nasty price war in the
envelope market is only just cooling down. Still, an exit multiple of little
more than 11 is hardly demanding. Moreover, the risks are lessened by Mr
Peter Williams' familiarity with the business. Having unloaded Spicers to
SCA for some Pounds 300m three years ago at the time of the Reedpack
acquisition, Mr Williams is now buying it back again at book value for
Smith.

FT  26 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The repercussions of crisis at Lloyd's spread far beyond the individual
Names now being asked to pick up the pieces of past mistakes. The thumping
Pounds 3bn loss on Lloyd's 1990 underwriting account announced this week,
with another Pounds 1bn deficit forecast for business written in 1991, is
causing a serious erosion of underwriting capacity. Far from creating
opportunities for other insurers which write international risks in London,
business is being driven elsewhere. It is in the wider interest of the City,
then, that Lloyd's shrinkage is reversed.
With premium rates increasing and tighter underwriting standards in place,
business now being written should show decent profits. The 25 per cent
average return on capital - including underwriting and investment returns -
targeted in Lloyd's business plan does not look unduly optimistic. But
neither is it generous, given the level of risk. A quoted Lloyd's fund of
the type planned by Sedgwick might attract investors on the basis of such
returns. Corporate investors putting money into Lloyd's through less liquid
vehicles will be looking for something more.
Professional investors will fancy their chances of beating the average,
notably by picking winners among the underwriting syndicates. But the sums
are finely balanced. If the entry cost for corporate capital is set too high
 -or if future returns are diluted by the cost of borrowing to subsidise
past losses - there is a danger that Lloyd's will be starved of new blood.

FT  26 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Richemont's rich deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be easy to depict Richemont's restructuring as a cynical,
short-term exercise designed to release cash to help the Swiss-based company
repay Pounds 612m of loan notes due next year. No doubt such financial
demands crossed the Rupert family's collective mind more than fleetingly.
But Richemont has long demonstrated that its interests as Rothmans' majority
shareholder are not inimical to those of minority investors. Further
consideration of its asset reshuffle emphasises the point.
Following the restructuring, Rothmans' shareholders will receive a fair
dollop of cash in the form of a 76p pay-out per share. Moreover, Rothmans'
dividend cover will drop from almost five to just over two. That will still
leave the reshaped Rothmans with a yield below that of BAT Industries. But
as a pure tobacco company, Rothmans promises to pursue expansion more
aggressively, perhaps offering a faster rate of growth.
The whole deal depends, though, on Dunhill's minority shareholders agreeing
to fold their interest together with Richemont's Cartier business into the
newly created Vendome. Dunhill's shareholders may justifiably gripe at the
higher valuation placed on Cartier's assets. They may also object to being
relegated to an even less significant minority without any compensating
goodwill premium. But Dunhill is suffering tough trading conditions. The
application of Cartier's management skills and access to a more extensive
distribution network should help compensate. The merger will also remove
Richemont's inherent problem of allocating financial resources between its
various luxury brands. The restructuring may not immediately release much
additional value. Richemont will have to persuade Dunhill shareholders that
it should yield rewards over time.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Waigel rejects advice on interest rates from Paris: French

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, yesterday effectively told his
French counterpart, Mr Edmond Alphandery, to mind his own business: the Bonn
government did not need outside advice, and German monetary policy was a
matter for the Bundesbank alone.
He was responding to a broadcast in which Mr Alphandery claimed he had
called a meeting in Paris for yesterday to discuss concerted action on
interest rates. Mr Alphandery said the Bundesbank should move faster to
relax its 'unduly restrictive' monetary policy.
'We are going to speak equal to equal . . . That was not the case a few
months ago . . . Today the franc can support itself, perhaps better than the
D-Mark,' Mr Alphandery said.
Mr Waigel, blaming pressure of work, instantly cancelled what his officials
called a 'routine' quarterly meeting of the Franco-German economic and
finance council. Yesterday he aired his riposte in a radio interview.
Mr Waigel said the Germans knew exactly what was required and what was
possible. The view from Frankfurt and Bonn is that the fledgling French
minister's statements on Thursday were clumsy and undiplomatic.
There would 'certainly' be no collaborative reductions in interest rates, he
said.
The government was doing 'precisely what is necessary to provide the
Bundesbank with room to manoeuvre', in preparing a package of cuts aimed at
reducing public spending deficits, which the Bundesbank considers essential
before it can consider further interest rate reductions.
It was certainly desirable that that interest rate cuts should be possible

reductions.
France now has official short-term rates below those in Germany for the
first time since the late 1960s.
Fresh indications that western German inflation has peaked emerged yesterday
with reports of year-on-year rises of 4.1 per cent and 3.9 per cent in two
key states during June.
For the whole of the region inflation is expected to dip to 3.5 per cent by
the end of the year. But recent forecasts suggest little further decline in
1994.

FT  26 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow subdued as Toronto aims

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stock markets ended a difficult week in subdued fashion yesterday, with
share prices little changed across the board in light trading, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.28 at 3,490.89. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 0.98 higher at 447.60, while the Amex
composite ended down 0.42 at 430.578. The Nasdaq composite put in the best
performance, ending 6.08 higher at 694.80. Trading volume on the New York
Stock Exchange was only 206m shares.
A week in which the markets posted both losses and gains ended on a flat
note. Investors and dealers mostly ignored the overnight news that President
Clinton's deficit-reduction economic package had narrowly passed the Senate,
because the plan is likely to face further changes before it finally emerges
from Congress, probably in August.
The day's only economic news was positive  - the National Association of
Realtors announced that sales of existing single-family homes rose by 4.6
per cent last month, a bigger increase than analysts had expected.
Signs of strength in the housing market, however, failed to stimulate buying
interest in the equity markets, which remained dogged by concerns about
corporate earnings. The second quarter reporting season is expected to start
in earnest within the next two weeks.
Bond prices were also subdued, although the upward momentum in longer-dated
Treasury securities was maintained.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  11/32 at 105
3/8 , and the yield was down to 6.702 per cent, close to its all-time low.
Profits warnings continued to affect certain stocks. Hershey Foods slumped
Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 47 1/8 after the company said that its second
quarter earnings could be 5-10 cents below the 34 cents a share it earned as
operating income a year ago.
Airline stocks continued to suffer from a renewed air fares war and recent
warnings of slowing sales from the industry, although declining oil prices
have given the sector some support. AMR, parent of American Airlines, fell
Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 61 7/8 , Delta dropped Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 47 3/8
, UAL Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 121 3/8 and USAir Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 16.
Precious metals and mining stocks were firmer in the wake of higher gold
prices. Newmont Mining climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 51 3/4 , Newmont
Gold put on Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 45 3/4 , ASA added Dollars 1 at Dollars
47 3/4 , Homestake Mining edged Dollars  3/8 higher to Dollars 19 and
Pegasus Gold rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 22 3/4 on the American Stock
Exchange.
Canada
TORONTO ended the week on a winning note. Based on preliminary data, the
TSE-300 index was up 12.19 points to 3,991.77 after briefly breaching the
4,000 mark. On the week, the index rose about 85 points.
Volume fell to 70.813m shares from 80.227m shares on Thursday and trading
value was CDollars 777.8m against CDollars 919.1m.
Golds rose 2.11 per cent and banking stocks increased 1.18 per cent. Energy
was also higher: Westcoast Energy rose  3/8 to 20 1/2 and Northstar Energy
jumped 2 1/4 to 30 3/4.

FT  26 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Lower rates are key to Nordic markets'
success - Christopher Brown-Humes says that prospects are still bright for
some of Europe's best performers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A potent cocktail of falling interest rates and rising corporate earnings,
spiced by devaluations and dollar sensitivity, has put the Nordic stock
markets among Europe's top performers this year.
Indeed, Finland's Hex index has led continental Europe with a 34 per cent
rise, while Oslo's all share index has shown a 28 per cent gain. With both
Copenhagen and Stockholm having strong runs, the Nordic Securities Market
calculates that the average rise for the four exchanges this year is close
to 20 per cent.
Falling interest rates and the expectation of further cuts have been the
main influence. This has increased prospects for economic recovery, soothed
nervousness over the state of the region's loss-making banks, and bolstered
corporate earnings. Interest has been enhanced by increased buying by
foreign investors switching away from the German and French markets.
The upturn in both Finland and Sweden has been helped by significant
currency depreciation, following the decision to float the markka and krone
last autumn, and by the expectation that both economies will emerge from
three years of negative GDP growth in 1994.
But perspective is important here. At the end of May, the Nordic markets
were only up 6 per cent from the same time last year. That is a good
indication of the extent to which Stockholm and Helsinki, in particular,
have recovered since the autumn currency turmoil.
The question, as they go into their summer lull, is whether the impetus can
be maintained. Some analysts feel that much of the corporate earnings
recovery is now discounted in Sweden and Finland, and they are nervous about
prospects in Denmark, with its strong currency and dependence on the German
market. There are also worries about new political turbulence in Sweden and
Finland in the autumn, as well as the general economic malaise in Europe.
At the same time, the firm expectation that European interest rates will
follow German rates downwards over the rest of the year has led most
analysts to conclude that the Nordic markets stand to make further gains
during the autumn, with little talk of anything more than a technical
downward correction.
Finland has already seen a correction, the Hex having fallen by around 12
per cent since its May 24 high of 1,258. Having more than doubled since last
September, its ebb on pre-holiday profit-taking was hardly surprising, but
it has prompted some commentators to suggest that the market has got ahead
of itself.
Sweden also saw a correction this week as a weakening currency postponed
hopes of further interest rate cuts, and the market reacted to news of a 3.8
per cent fall in first quarter GDP.
But there is a feeling that share prices could move further ahead if the
dollar strengthens further, and as companies begin to feel the full benefits
of last November's effective devaluation in the second half as hedging
programmes expire.
Nevertheless, there are outstanding concerns over the robustness of the
economy and the size of the budget deficit.
Expectations are arguably highest for Norway, in spite of the spurt it has
already put in this year, because of improving economic fundamentals and the
high percentage of corporate earnings linked to the strengthening dollar.
There are also clear indications that the country is past the worst of its
banking and insurance crisis.
A strong recovery in shipping share prices - based on dollar strength rather
than improving market fundamentals - is already under way, with the Oslo
shipping index rising to 505 this week from 345 at the beginning of March.
Mr Tom Skjelstad, a stockbroker at Norse Securities, believes there could be
further gains in the autumn, taking the total index to around 550 at the end
of the year from 485 this week. In the meantime there is likely to be
nervousness about the outcome of the September election, with the governing
Labour party likely to poll fewer votes because of its support for EC
membership.
Denmark is probably the least favoured of the four. The 'Yes' to Maastricht
is May was already discounted, and so is likely to have little bearing on
the market's development over the rest of the year.
In addition, the country's exporters are struggling with a strong currency,
worsening conditions in Germany, and a negative impact from recent tax
reform proposals.
In spite of this, not everyone is pessimistic. Mr Fleming Madson, head of
equity research at Danske Securities, predicts that Danish corporate
earnings will still rise by 17 per cent this year, and that the market can
rise by a further 10 per cent over the next 12 months.

after early falls

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POSITION squaring in advance of the weekend's Tokyo metropolitan assembly
elections dominated activity, and share prices posted marginal declines in
low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average fell 25.50 to 19,659.57 after a high of 19,755.45 and a
low of 19,485.79. The Topix index of all first section stocks moved even
more narrowly, falling 0.03 to 1,584.05 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50
index fell 0.69 to 1,200.25.
Most investors remained sidelined, while public fund managers supported the
market against arbitrage selling. Volume totalled 260m shares against 250m.
Gainers led losers by 522 to 468, with 164 issues remaining unchanged.
Reports on the insolvency of Nikomart, an unlisted convenience store chain,
prompted selling of supermarket chain operators. Teikoku Data Bank, a
private credit research company, said Nikomart, whose debts totalled
Y11.7bn, had been hit by excessive expansion. Jusco fell Y60 to Y1,890 and
Seiyu lost Y40 to Y1,350.
Mining issues, which were beneficiaries of the rise in gold prices, lost
ground on profit-taking. Sumitomo Metal Mining, the most active issue of the
day, plunged Y30 to Y1,000 and Mitsui Mining and Smelting fell Y14 to Y501.
The oil sector was the strongest performer of the day, rising 1.08 per cent.
Reports of a hike in wholesale oil prices encouraged some short-term
investors, with Showa Shell Sekiyu up Y30 to Y1,050.
The strong performance of Steven Spielberg's movie Jurassic Park in the US
boosted Toho Y1,000 to Y20,000. The movie theatre operator will distribute
the movie in Japan this summer.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 9.80 to 21,763.23 in volume of 18.5m shares.
Roundup
AFTERNOON recoveries after early falls were a pre-valent theme in the
region.
HONG KONG trimmed big early losses after news of some progress in the
Sino-British talks. The Hang Seng index closing only 48.56 lower at
7,014.08, 2.6 per cent lower on the week, after sliding more than 134 points
earlier.
Turnover eased from HKDollars 4.78bn to HKDollars 4.24 bn. Trading focused
on China related stocks or shell companies.
KUALA LUMPUR also recovered, the KLSE composite index closing 7.14 higher at
708.80, 3.6 per cent lower on the week, after losing 26.15 or 3.7 pct to
675.51 in the morning.
Malaysia has been one of the region's best performers this year, and
analysts said that the market's sharp correction this week was healthy and
would not disrupt its long-term uptrend.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index closed 0.77 up at 1,771.67 after
falling to an intra-day low of 1,721.97. Brokers said that falls in
Malaysian shares over the counter had been far greater than in Singapore
blue chips. Volume rose from 175.1m shares to 300.5m.
NEW ZEALAND saw a sharp rise in Telecom to a record high as the NZSE-40
index rose 14.15 to 1,655.29. Telecom rose 8 cents to a recond high of
Dollars 3.10. Brokers said it was well bid in the US overnight but were
unable to explain why it rose so far.
TAIWAN continued its technical rebound, the weighted index ending 50.11 or
1.2 per cent up at 4,182.28, just 0.8 per cent up on the week, as turnover
expanded from TDollars 16.8bn to TDollars 20.2 billion.
Banking stocks attracted strong buying interest, the financial sector
sub-index ending 2.7 per cent higher on the day, with First Commercial Bank
surging TDollars 6 to TDollars 153 and Hua Nan rising TDollars 5.50 to
TDollars 142.
BOMBAY's BSE index closed with a decline of 23.84 at 2,203.96, 0.5 per cent
lower on the week. Brokers said that the volume of trade was limited,
investors preferring to watch and wait as a fresh round of speculation began
over the government's survival.

FT  26 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich registers its fourth
all-time high of the week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANALYSTS fought a losing battle with dealers in the German equity market,
while Switzerland continued to demonstrate its consistency, writes Our
Markets Staff.
ZURICH continued to find support in the dollar, ending at its fourth
all-time high of the week. The SMI index rose 12.1 to 2,348.2, 1.3 per cent
up on the week.
Miss Michelle Doughty of Hoare Govette in London said that the market was
also continuing to benefit from investors switching from other European
markets.
Continuing hopes of easier interest rates and expectations of strong profit
rises in banks boosted the market. CS Holding rose SFr30 to SFr2,640 and SBC
SFr6 to SFr402.
Portfolio management banks were also in demand. Baer Holding added SFr60 or
4.5 per cent to SFr1,375 after Thursday's announcement that first-half
profits would be above the level for the whole of 1992.
Richemont bearers, suspended for the previous two sessions, eased SFr20 to
SFr1,370. An initially positive reaction to plans to reorganise its tobacco
and luxury goods interests was countered by disappointment with its results.
FRANKFURT's DAX index rose 8.95 to 1,696.20, 0.5 per cent higher on the
week, turnover falling from DM6.9bn to DM6bn. Its main winners were the
banks, recouping some of their losses over the week as a whole.
Bayernhypo and Bayernverein, the most interest rate-sensitive in the sector,
recovered DM7.50 to DM401, and DM5.50 to DM420.50. Commerzbank put on DM3.50
to DM298 and Deutsche Bank DM6 to DM682.20.
There was head-shaking over carmakers, winners over the week and strong
again yesterday. Daimler rose DM3.50 to DM616.50 and put on another DM4 to
DM620.50 after hours although its Mercedes-Benz unit forecast an operating
loss for 1993.
PARIS was dampened down by profit-taking, but it still had its rising stars
as the CAC-40 index ended 2.46 lower at 1,960.84 on the day, and 2.6 per
cent higher on the week.
Turnover fell by FFr1bn to FFr3bn. Peugeot extended its gains on the week to
FFr65, or 12.6 per cent with a rise of FFr19 to FFr582. Still in the
automotive sector, Michelin put on FFr7.90 to FFr158.10 on the grounds that
it was probably oversold.
Matra-Hachette, rose FFr4.50 to FFr139.50. Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, the
defence and communications group's chairman, repeated his expectation of
'significantly higher' net profits this year.
AMSTERDAM saw limited gains which took the CBS Tendency index 0.8 higher to
111.5, up 2.1 per cent on the week.
Philips rose 80 cents to Fl 29.20 after its German unit revealed lower 1992
net profits, and predicted break-even in 1994. A Fl 1.90 or 5.8 per cent
rise to Fl 34.30 by Nedlloyd was attributed to reports that analysts were
recommending the stock.
Nutricia, the baby and hospital food group, lost Fl 1.50 to Fl 132.50 after
confirming rumours of a withdrawal of its powder baby foods across the US
after a salmonella scare.
MILAN made little headway in thin turnover as investors awaited the outcome
of labour negotiations. The Comit index dipped 0.20 to 534.43, little
changed on the week.
Olivetti extended Thursday's gains, rising L55 to fix at L1,440 before
L1,460 on the kerb on continued hopes that it will obtain a licence for
cellular telephone operations.
MADRID ran into doubts that the Socialists will be able to form a coalition
government and the general index closed 3.41 lower at 258.60, 2.3 per cent
lower on the week.
Argentaria and Santander lost Pta75 to Pta4,625 and Pta 150 to Pta5,600 in
banks and Cubiertas and Uralita shed Pta380 to Pta6,650, and Pta49 to Pta791
respectively in the more volatile construction sector.
COPENHAGEN continued its advance amid widespread expectations of further
sizeable rises next week. The KFX index added 0.25 at 89.19, in turnover of
DKr644m.
Moeller's D/S 1912 A and B shares both rose DKr1,000 to DKr109,000 and
DKr108,500 respectively, while Danisco, the food, sugar beet and packaging
group, ended DKr15 higher at DKr750.

FT  26 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Caution on Richemont proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLUME in tobacco group Rothmans International, relisted yesterday after a
one-day suspension, rose to 7.1m shares, the highest daily total for five
years, as the market digested plans by its parent company Richemont to
reorganise its Rothmans, Cartier and Dunhill subsidiaries.
The shares jumped 20 to 743p immediately after being relisted but later fell
back sharply to close 28 down at 692p on a mixture of profit-taking and
cautious views of the group reorganisation.
One analyst suggested shareholders might even vote against the deal and
said: 'The deal has benefits but there isn't much more value created by it.'
Another market watcher simply said that closer examination of the deal
showed the shares to be overvalued at current levels. Similar caution was
registered by holders of Dunhill and the shares gave up 22 to 383p.

FT  26 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities drift lower in light selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WARNING from the UK chancellor of the exchequer that domestic taxes might
have to be raised this autumn if the economic recovery fails to accelerate
unsettled the London stock market yesterday. Share prices gave ground again
but selling pressure remained light and the market steadied to hold on to
the lower end of the new trading range which has emerged this week.
Mr Kenneth Clarke also indicated, in an interview with the Financial Times,
that there was no immediate prospect of a further cut in UK base rates and
that he would take no risks with inflation.
Although uneasy at the opening, the stock market left it to the stock index
futures sector to set the pace for the day. An early fall in the September
contract on the Footsie soon turned the underlying market downwards and by
mid-session the index was down by 11.5. Distortions were caused by erratic
movement in shares of Rothmans International as they returned from
suspension following disclosure of details of the restructuring of
Richemont, the Zurich-based parent.
Trading volume in equities was thin, however, and the market rallied from
the day's low of 2,883.2, which was the top end of the trading range broken
at the beginning of the week. By the end of the session, the FT-SE Index had
recovered to 2,887.5, a net loss on the day of 7.2 points.
Seaq volume of 509m shares was focused on the Footsie list, with non-Footsie
business dropping to only 54 per cent of the total. On Thursday, retail
business was worth Pounds 1.14bn.
Market strategists remained confident that the Footsie has established
itself in a new trading range based on the 2,800 area. However, the equity
team at SG Warburg yesterday maintained its year-end forecast at 2,900,
commenting that there was 'little sign yet' of the earnings upgrades which
had been expected by the bulls.
The FT-SE 100 Share Index ended the week a mere 8.1 points up as fading
hopes of reductions in German and UK interest rates took the heart out of a
market encouraged at first by improvement in the latest UK economic data,
especially the better employment figures.
The week also brought profit-taking in the second line stocks which had been
outperforming the blue chips. Yesterday's fall of 2.6 put the FT-SE Mid 250
Index at 3,215.8, compared with the all-time peak of 3,218.5 reached on
Monday.

<TEXT>
COMMENTS from the UK chancellor on the budget deficit dashed any lingering
hopes of a cut in interest rates and unsettled stock index futures, writes
Joel Kibazo.
The opening of the September contracts on the FTSE-100 at 2,909, four points
below its previous close, was the first indication of the effect of the
chancellor's comments and by midday continuous selling in a thin market had
driven September to the day's low of 2,901. Institutional business remained
low but September managed to hold on to the premium through the session.
Having hovered around the 2,905 level for a few hours, sporadic bargain
hunting saw the contract finish at 2,908, two points above its estimated
fair value premium to cash of 11 points on poor volume.
Traded options ended the week in poor form. The last session of the week
brought total volume of of 17,507 contracts. Most of that total came from
activity in the stock options with Hanson leading the way with 2,104 lots,
contracts followed Lonrho at 1,544.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Money Markets: No co-ordinated cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE downward trend in European interest rates was given a small boost
yesterday, when the Portuguese central bank became the latest European bank
to reduce its key money rate, writes Gillian Tett.
The Bank of Portugal cut its rate for absorbing money liquidity by 0.75 per
cent to 10.25 per cent.
But in the wake of the political controversy that has surrounded the French
and German authorities' plans for interest rate cuts, it was speculation
about the Bundesbank's plans for interest rate cuts that continued to
dominate European money markets.
Earlier in the week comments from Mr Edmond Alphandery, French finance
minister, had fuelled speculation that Germany and France might be seeking a
co-ordinated reduction in interest rates.
But Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, yesterday sought to squash
these rumours.
With both Germany and France now facing mounting pressure for interest rate
cuts, the mood in the markets yesterday remained fairly buoyant, with many
traders still believing that the Bundesbank could cut rates next week.
Although some traders interpreted Mr Alphandery's actions this week as
evidence of the French intention to cut interest rates irrespective of the
Germans, others pointed out that the Bank of France could not sustain
interest rates that were lower than German rates for long.
Amid the speculation and uncertainty, German futures drifted downwards amid
a day of heavy trading, with the September contract for the Euro D-Mark
closed at 93.10 per cent, around 13 basis points below its opening position.
The London markets remained fairly quiet, in spite of a statement yesterday
by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British chancellor indicating that the British
Government had no plans for interest rate cuts.
'Although there were a lot of hopes about a rate cut earlier, that has all
really faded now,' explained one dealer, who predicted that the British
money markets were now 'in for a long, boring summer,' with technical
factors serving as the main reason for market movement.
After forecasting a shortage of 1.35bn, the Bank of England later removed
almost all of this during the course of the day.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Spotlight on the Yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN shot back into the spotlight again yesterday after it staged a sharp
early rally against the dollar, and reached a new post war high against the
D-Mark, writes Gillian Tett.
In the Far East markets, the dollar fell below the Y107 level, down from a
New York close of Y108.7 in spite of repeated intervention by the Bank of
Japan.
Although the dollar later rallied in European trading, closing at Y109.2,
the yen continued to strengthen against most European currencies.
Most traders yesterday said that the yen's recovery against the dollar had
been widely expected, in light of its rapid weakening this week. However
opinions remained divided about how much further the dollar would fall.
Most dealers yesterday said that the main reason behind the yen's rally was
the growing confidence in the market that the elections in Japan were
unlikely to lead to major political change in the country.
'The weakness we saw earlier was really due to temporary political factors,'
said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank.
But with most traders continuing to insist that they were bullish about the
underlying strength of the dollar, the consensus was that the dollar was
unlikely to fall as low as the Y105 mark that it reached earlier this month.
In Europe the D-Mark reached a new low of Y62.25, down from Y63.79 the
previous day.
In spite of edging up against the dollar and French Franc, the D-Mark
continued to look weak against most European currencies.
Nevertheless, some dealers yesterday insisted that in light of the recent
political developments between the French and German finance ministries, the
main spotlight in the European currencies over the coming days was likely to
be the French franc.
Speculation that the Bank of France might be planning to push ahead with
interest rate cuts, in spite of the refusal of Mr Theo Waigel, the German
Finance Minister, to agree to concerted interest rate cuts, weakened the
franc. It finally closed at FFr3.378 down from FFr3.363 on the previous day.
'The markets are very nervous about the franc now,' said Mr Jim O'Neill,
economist with Swiss Bank, who predicts that the Franc could soften to
FFr3.395 in the near future.
Meanwhile, a statement from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British chancellor of the
exchequer, indicating that the government would not implement any further

FT  26 JUN 93 / International Company News: Northern Telecom sees loss in
second term

<TEXT>
NORTHERN Telecom sent a shock wave through the telecommunications equipment
industry late yesterday by forecasting a second-quarter loss and a
significant drop in earnings for 1993 as a whole.
The Toronto-based company also announced the replacement of its chairman Dr
Paul Stern by Mr Bradford Butler, a former chairman of Procter &amp; Gamble, the
US consumer goods group. Dr Stern stepped down earlier this year as
Northern's chief executive. Mr Butler is a Northern director.
Northern said the second-quarter loss mainly reflected unexpectedly weak
sales of public switching equipment and slimmer margins.
It said revenue growth in most European and North American markets had been
weaker than expected. A spokesman singled out lower capital spending by US
regional telephone companies and by Bell Canada.
Northern's first-quarter earnings of USDollars 75.9m were 27 per cent lower
than a year earlier, although revenues edged up 2.3 per cent to Dollars
1.94bn.
When the first-quarter results were published less than two months ago, Mr
Jean Monty, who replaced Dr Stern as chief executive, predicted that results
for the rest of the year would be similar on a quarter-by-quarter basis to
1992. Second-quarter earnings last year were Dollars 72.3m.
Trading in Northern's shares was halted in Toronto and New York shortly
before yesterday's announcement. They last traded at CDollars 47.38 in
Toronto. Northern is 53 per cent owned by BCE.

<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of Northwest Airlines' parent company met in Minneapolis yesterday
amid rumours they could put the carrier, the fourth largest in the US, into
bankruptcy if labour concessions were not secured.
The meeting will reconvene on Monday by teleconference. Northwest, in which
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines holds a minority stake, has borrowings of well more
than Dollars 4bn.
It faces a demanding debt repayment schedule over the next few years, and
has been trying to persuade its bankers to reschedule payments on the
condition that it delivers labour concessions worth about Dollars 300m a
year over the next three years.
Northwest offered a 30 per cent equity stake to unions as part of the deal
and has reached agreement with unions representing its machinists and flight
attendants. However, two weeks ago, the rank-and-file machinists voted
against the deal. The other key labour group  - the pilots  - has never
reached agreement with the company, although talks have been continuing this
week.
If the bankruptcy threat becomes reality, Northwest would be the sixth large
US carrier to have entered Chapter 11 since 1990.

chief
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR VAUGHN Bryson resigned yesterday as chief executive of US pharmaceuticals
group Eli Lilly because of clashes with its board and was replaced by Mr
Randall Tobias, the vice-chairman of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph and head
of its international operations.
Lilly said Mr Bryson, who is 54 and had only been chief executive for 20
months, had decided to retire because of 'differences with the board over
management philosophy.'
A company spokesman declined to elaborate, but Lilly  - best known for
Prozac, the world's top-selling anti-depressant drug  - has been plagued by
problems over the past year, leading to disappointing financial results.
The company's stock rose on yesterday afternoon's news as analysts
speculated that Mr Tobias might be more successful in solving its
difficulties. The shares closed at Dollars 51 1/4 , up Dollars 1 7/8 , in
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Mr Tobias, 51, has been an outside director of Lilly since 1986. He will
also take over as chairman of the group from Mr Richard Wood, who retired as
chief executive in 1991 but stayed on as chairman.
Mr Tobias, who was elected vice-chairman of AT&amp;T in 1986, has been with the
telecommunications group throughout his career, apart from two years in the
army.
He has been a long-time close associate of the telecommunications group's
chairman, Mr Robert Allen, who was his first supervisor when he joined AT&amp;T
in 1964. AT&amp;T has yet to decide how to fill his positions.
Mr Tobias has played an important role in AT&amp;T's recent push to become a
much broader communications and computer business and a more important
international presence. He has been chairman of its AT&amp;T international
subsidiary since 1991.
Lilly's recent problems have included new competition for Prozac, its
primary engine of growth; a shutdown at an emergency heart defibrillator
plant when the Food and Drug Administration found production defects; and a
mix-up in regulatory filings over a cardiac catheter. Last October it
reported its first quarterly loss since 1951, when it started to report
results publicly.

EMAIL, the Australian white goods and building products group, is to pay
ADollars 326.5m (USDollars 220.3m) for a number of buildings products
businesses from National Consolidated (NCL), writes Bruce Jacques.
NCL, part of the troubled Adsteam group, said the sale price would yield a
book profit of about ADollars 132m. This would be used to reduce borrowings.
Email said the businesses acquired were expected to have sales of ADollars
310m, and earnings before interest and tax of ADollars 28m. The deal will
lift Email's turnover to around ADollars 1.8bn.

MR JEAN Peyrelevade, chairman of Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP),
France's biggest insurance group, yesterday said the company was on course
for a 'significant increase' in profits this year in preparation for
privatisation.
He said 1993 should mark a 'significant step' in UAP's recovery, although he
cautioned it did not expect to reach 1990's net profits of FFr4bn (Dollars
695m).
UAP, which suffered a steep fall in net profits to FFr1.08bn in 1992 from
FFr3.77bn in 1991, is one of 21 state-controlled companies scheduled for
sale to the private sector by France's new centre-right government.
Mr Peyrelevade has been making strenuous efforts to ensure that UAP will be
one of the first privatisation candidates.
The improvement in UAP's performance could play an important part in Mr
Peyrelevade's plans. Assurances Generales de France (AGF) and GAN Group, the
other state-controlled insurers, are also scheduled for sale.
AGF is regarded as UAP's chief competitor in the privatisation stakes. GAN
this week warned it had to resolve the problems of its loss-making damage
division before being sold.

BENETTON, Italy's best-known clothing group, is re-jigging some of its
short-term borrowings to cut interest costs in a surprise series of
innovative financing deals.
The company's net borrowings totalled L325bn (Dollars 215.66m) at the end of
last year.
The deals will start next month with a L200bn bond issue targeted at
international institutional investors. The issue, which comes with warrants
for Benetton shares, will be launched between July 10 and July 15, with a
coupon of between 4.5 and 5 per cent.
It will be followed in September by a L150bn syndicated loan from a pool of
Italian banks, and an innovative L100bn domestic bond with warrants indexed
to four leading stock indices.
The equity-linked issue, similar to other recent transactions, would allow
investors to hold the bond but detach the warrants, indexed to the US,
German, French and Japanese markets, if share prices were rising sharply. It
will be launched in October and will have a minimum coupon of 7 per cent.

over-subscribed, writes Alice Rawsthorn.
The domestic tranche drew applications for 113m shares, or 17 times the
number available. The international tranche generated applications for seven
times the 4.4m shares allocated to foreign investors. Some FFr2.4bn will go
to the government, while FFr1.8bn will go to Caisse des Depots, the
public-sector financial institution which sold the rest of the shares.

MR JEAN Peyrelevade, chairman of Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP),
France's biggest insurance group, yesterday announced the company was on

privatisation.
He said 1993 should mark a 'significant step' in UAP's recovery, although he
cautioned it did not expect to reach 1990's net profits of FFr4bn (Dollars

UAP, which suffered a steep decline in net profits to FFr1.08bn in 1992 from
FFr3.77bn in 1991, is one of the 21 state-controlled companies scheduled for
sale to the private sector by France's new centre-right government.
Mr Peyrelevade, whose position is seen as vulnerable because of his close
links with the previous government and a recent row with the Suez group over
UAP's attempts to win control of Colonia, a German insurer, has been making
strenuous efforts to ensure UAP will be one of the first privatisation
candidates.
The improvement in UAP's performance could play an important part in Mr
Peyrelevade's plans. Assurances Generales de France (AGF) and GAN Group, the
other state-controlled insurers, are also scheduled for sale.
AGF is regarded as UAP's chief competitor in the privatisation stakes. GAN
this week warned it had to resolve the problems of its loss-making damage
division before being sold.
UAP has addressed the problems of its insurance business by raising tariffs
and exercising greater scrutiny over new policies. It also expects this year
to reduce the losses of Banque Worms, its banking subsidiary which in 1992
was badly affected by the property crisis.
Schneider, the electrical engineering and construction group, plans to
restructure its ownership later this year by being absorbed by SPEP, its
parent company, in a share swap. SPEP will offer 10 of its shares for seven
Schneider shares. The change forms part of Schneider's debt-reduction
programme.
Schneider expects to make disposals of non-core assets worth FFr1.5bn in
1993, an executive said.

<TEXT>
THE Japanese market is an open market to be compared with any other car
market in the world. The issue of whether the Japanese market is closed or
open is a kind of a yesterday question,' says Mr Hans-Olov Olsson, president
of Volvo Japan.
So what is it about the Japanese car market which has kept foreign
penetration to less than 3 per cent, while Japanese makers enjoy a 12 per
cent share of markets in Europe and nearly 30 per cent in the US?
In Mr Olsson's experience, the answer lies in the history of domination by
Japan's domestic manufacturers rather than any current formal barriers. It
is also consumers' high quality standards and the need for long-term
thinking that challenge the western manufacturer hoping to penetrate the
Japanese market.
Local domination for decades has ensured that domestic companies have
cornered the best dealership sites, making it difficult for foreign
companies to gain access to the most important distribution networks.
When Volvo tried to form dealerships it ran up against a system of quotas
that officially limits the number of dealerships allowed in any given area
of Japan. Such obstacles meant Volvo needed to make a large, long-term
financial commitment to the market.
In its years in Japan, Volvo has moved from a joint venture operation with a
Japanese company to establishing a wholly-owned subsidiary in 1986. Today it
has its own retail operations, which account for 30 per cent of sales in
Japan.
The bulk of sales, however, comes from independent dealers. These provide 50
per cent of the company's Japanese revenues. A joint venture with Fuji Heavy
Industries brings in a further 17 per cent. 'We have spent a lot of money in
building up a network and in developing products for the Japanese market,'
Mr Olsson says.
Volvo has also had to improve quality standards to meet the high
expectations of Japanese consumers. In Japan, it is a basic condition that
cars have to have automatic gear boxes, air conditioning, radio systems,
electric windows and right-hand drive.
Japanese consumers are hard to please. They do not accept bad painting,
spills, dust or poor fittings. 'If you fail on this today there is no
chance,' Mr Olsson says. 'This market is so demanding that if you fail you
really fail. You really have to feel yourself a samurai and fight.'
Volvo's rewards so far have been promising. In the past eight years, the
company's registrations have increased from 1,046 cars to 8,628 last year,
when sales fell in line with the decline of the Japanese market. In 1990,
registrations peaked at 10,915 units.
Volvo is aiming for sales of 10,200 this year. Mr Olsson believes the
company's reading of the market was correct and that the current surge of
interest in estate cars in Japan will help it achieve that target.
In 1986 Volvo did not sell any estate cars. Today they represent 60 per cent
of sales.
'Once you have built trust, I think you are rewarded. Then the Japanese
customer will stay with you and support you,' Mr Olsson says.

The company's net borrowings totalled L325bn (Dollars 215.66m) at the end of

German, French and Japanese markets, if share prices were rising sharply.
The equity-linked issue, to be launched in October, will have a minimum

Last year Benetton managed to shrug off the effects of the downturn in
world-wide consumer spending and increase 1992 net profits by 12 per cent,
to L184.7bn, on sales of L2,512bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BHP, the Australian resources company, more than doubled net earnings for
the year ended May, following strong contributions from all divisions and a
hefty turnround for abnormal items.
The company yesterday reported a 132 per cent increase in attributable
profit, to ADollars 1.19bn (USDollars 804m), on an 11.5 per cent revenue
lift to ADollars 16.7bn. The dividend is being held at 40.5 cents a share.
The bulk of the earnings upturn came from abnormal items. In 1991-92, BHP
wrote down the value of its investment in the Foster's Brewing group by
ADollars 312m, but in the latest year it recorded a ADollars 203.8m tax
benefit.
Excluding abnormals, BHP reported a 19.8 per cent earnings rise to ADollars
991m. The results were helped by a weaker Australian dollar, which averaged
USDollars 0.71 on BHP sales, compared with USDollars 0.77 in the previous
year.
The steel division emerged as the company's best profit improver, lifting
profit before abnormals by 28 per cent to ADollars 242.5m. BHP said a
full-year contribution from New Zealand Steel, higher domestic sales, and
lower costs helped.
The petroleum division lifted profit 21.1 per cent to ADollars 461.4m,
reflecting higher production and lower exploration expenditure.
The minerals division remained BHP's biggest absolute contributor, in spite
of a marginal 3 per cent profit increase, to ADollars 672.9m. Record output
helped to overcome lower prices, BHP said.
The service companies lifted their profits contribution by almost 75 per
cent to ADollars 75.8m, mainly reflecting increased dividends from the
Foster's Brewing investment.
The result followed an increase in depreciation provision, from ADollars
1.22bn to ADollars 1.38bn, largely resulting from full ownership of New
Zealand Steel and the opening of several new operations.
Interest expenses eased marginally, from ADollars 558.9m to ADollars 556.5m,
and tax took ADollars 596m, against ADollars 738.7m previously.

FT  26 JUN 93 / International Company News: French banking float given warm
reception
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT Local de France, the specialist French banking group, yesterday
announced that its FFr4.2bn (Dollars 750m) sale of state-owned shares had
been heavily over-subscribed by French and foreign investors.
The success of the CLF sale is encouraging for the government's ambitious
privatisation plans. The government had regarded the sale as an important
test of the stock market's appetite for state assets. The first round of
privatisations, including Banque Nationale de Paris and Air France, is
scheduled to start in early September.
The domestic tranche of the CLF issue, which involved the sale of 6.5m
shares, attracted applications for 113m shares, or 17 times the number
available.
The international tranche was also over-subscribed, generating applications
for seven times the 4.4m shares allocated to foreign investors.
Some FFr2.4bn of the money raised by the CLF sale will go directly to the
government - the first contribution to the FFr40bn that Mr Edouard Balladur,
prime minister, hopes to raise from privatisations in 1993. The remaining
FFr1.8bn will go to Caisse des Depots, the public-sector financial
institution, which sold the rest of the shares.

FT  26 JUN 93 / International Company News: Email to pay Dollars A326m for
NCL businesses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EMAIL, the Australian white goods and building products group, is to pay
ADollars 326.5m (USDollars 220.3m) for a number of buildings products
businesses from National Consolidated (NCL).
NCL, part of the troubled Adsteam group, said the sale price, which was
subject to adjustments, would yield the company a book profit of about
Dollars A132m. This would be used to reduce borrowings.
The NCL divisions, which have been on the market for some months, include a
number of prominent building product brands. Email said the businesses
acquired were expected to have sales of Dollars 310m, and earnings before
interest and tax of Dollars 28m.
The businesses to be sold are Dorf Industries, Ogden Industries, Whitco,
Aluminium Extrusions, Australian Die Castings, Luke &amp; Singer, and Extruded
Metals.
The deal will lift Email's turnover to around ADollars 1.8bn. The effect on
profitability and earnings per share is expected to be positive from the
beginning, Email said.

FT  26 JUN 93 / International Company News: China questions Murdoch bid for
22% stake in TVB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
MR RUPERT Murdoch's bid to enter Asian broadcasting is in doubt after China
yesterday questioned the wisdom of allowing him to buy 22 per cent of
Television Broadcasts (TVB), Hong Kong's leading broadcaster.
The semi-official China News Agency (CNA) warned the Hong Kong government
that careful research was needed to determine if the public interest would
be affected by Mr Murdoch's purchase of TVB.
'Since it is the general policy of the Hong Kong government to restrict
media cross-ownership, deep thought is required before any decision is
made,' CNA said.
TVB's licence, which is valid until 2000, comes up for periodic review next
year. China may well argue that, as the licence is a form of franchise, any
change in TVB's ownership ought to be the subject of Sino-British talks.
The entry of China into the Hong Kong government's determination of the
purchase has cast a cloud over News International's HKDollars 1.85bn
(USDollars 239m) offer, unveiled earlier this month. It complicates the
already difficult regulatory hurdles Mr Murdoch has to overcome in order to
win government approval.
To take up his 22 per cent of TVB, Mr Murdoch needs three exemptions from
Hong Kong's broadcasting law.
The first is the restriction the law makes on foreigners' voting rights.
Currently foreign shareholders in a television licensee can vote only up to
10 per cent of a company's stock, even if their share-holding exceeds 10 per
cent.
Mr Murdoch also needs approval from Hong Kong's Executive Council, or
quasi-cabinet, to own more than 15 per cent of a television licensee.
Furthermore, he needs an exemption from the limits on shareholder ownership
in television companies.
News International's purchase of TVB also comes at a time when Hong Kong
regulators are drafting tougher cross-ownership regulations. If enacted,
these would make it impossible for the owner of newspapers in Hong Kong to
control a television station.
Mr Murdoch currently owns the South China Morning Post, Hong Kong's leading
English-language newspaper, and the Wha Kiu Yat Po, a Chinese-language
newspaper.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc traders look on the black
side - Week in the markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN ZINC producers' announcements this week of planned production cuts
appeared to emphasise the present malaise of the oversupplied market, rather
than encourage the view that a better balanced was on the way.
As London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks of the metal rose another 10,350
tonnes to a record 688,025 tonnes the exchange's three months delivery price
surrendered Dollars 4 of last week's tentative recovery to close yesterday
at Dollars 945.50 a tonne, Dollars 12 above the recent six-year low.
A hesitant rally was prompted on Monday by news that desperate European
producers were preparing for submission to the European Commission a
proposal for a co-ordinated industry scheme under which one or two producers
would close smelting capacity permanently and be compensated for closure
costs by the rest of the industry. But the price gains were wiped out the
next day.
There was a similarly muted reaction to Thursday's statement by Mr
Jean-Pierre Rodier, chief executive of Union Miniere of Belgium, that his
company wanted to give up its role as the world's biggest zinc producer.
At a meeting in London with mining analysts he said a planned expansion at
the Balen refinery in Belgium had been cancelled and outlined plans to sell
over the next five years the company's refineries and mines in the US and
Sweden. Late last year UM permanently closed its 100,000-tonnes-a-year
refinery at Overpelt in Belgium.
Nickel traders were also inclined to take a jaundiced view of apparently
bullish news. Until yesterday, a run of LME stocks falls was being dismissed
as a temporary phenomenon resulting from bureaucratic delays to Russian
shipments, and a fresh surge of arrivals was predicted. So prices remained
under pressure and the LME's three months position sank early yesterday to a
fresh seven-month low of Dollars 5,340 a tonne.
The announcement yesterday, however, of a further 1,842-tonne stocks fall,
taking to 9,792 tonnes the total drawdown since the June 8 record of 96,312
tonnes, seemed to bring a change of heart. As some of them became sceptical
about the long-awaited flood of Russian material traders marked nickel
prices higher and the three months position closed at Dollars 5,425 a tonne,
up Dollars 5 on the day but still Dollars 200 down on the week.
The tin market's technical rally from recent 20-year lows ran out of steam
this week and in late trading yesterday the Dollars 5,000-a-tonne support
level for the LME three months contract was coming under increasing
pressure. It closed at Dollars 5,027.50 a tonne, down Dollars 212.50 on the
week. The market is weighed down at present by expectations of increased
deliveries to an already oversupplied market as producers' resolve on export
restraint evaporates.
The copper market remained trapped in its narrow dollar range, though the
weakness of the pound created the illusion of firmness in the LME's sterling
denominated market, where the three months position closed yesterday at
Pounds 1,284.75 a tonne, up Pounds 38.50 on the week.
The market failed in repeated attempts to break decisively through the
Dollars 1,900 barrier, but concern about US labour contract expiries at the
end of the month ensured that the Dollars 1,850-a-tonne price floor also
remained intact.
LME copper stocks ended a long run of rises yesterday, but the 750-tonne
fall was less than many traders had been expecting and did little to
encourage buying.
The only genuinely firm LME contract was aluminium, which benefited from
constructive chart patterns and persistent rumours that a large smelter
closure was to be announced soon.
An early attempt push the three months price through resistance at Dollars
1,215 a tonne was unsuccessful, but after a quick shake-out in mid-week that
barrier fell and the price yesterday touched a 3 1/2 -month high before
closing at Dollars 1,229.50 a tonne, up Dollars 24.75 on the week.
At the London bullion market the gold price, depressed by the dollar's
strength and producer selling in Canada, Australia and South Africa, where
the present price level is relatively attractive in local currency terms,
slid in the early part of the week towards the bottom of its recent trading
range. But having failed to drive the price below Dollars 366 a troy ounce
speculative sellers switched tactics on Thursday and became enthusiastic
buyers. The price gained Dollars 5.80 on that day and another Dollars 2.65
yesterday to end Dollars 4.20 up on balance at Dollars 376.45 an ounce.
One dealer had told the Reuter news agency earlier in the day that a close
above Dollars 375 an ounce in New York could signal an assault on the
Dollars 380 barrier next week.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox), which this week announced
that it was to revert to its former name of the London Commodity Exchange,
the cocoa market put in a much more active performance - Tuesday's volume
was a record 46,458 lots of 10 tonnes. A continuation of last week's
technical rally lifted the September futures price to a three-month high of
Pounds 741 a tonne before a technical correction trimmed it to Pounds 727 at
yesterday's close, up Pounds 12 on the week.
Dealers thought the upsurge in activity might foreshadow a deliberate supply
squeeze. 'September is the traditional month for squeezes and that is
exactly what we have here. And if you want to go for September, then you
have to go all out for July,' one trader told Reuter.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TGI, which concentrates on the design and manufacture of loudspeaker
products, suffered from the difficult trading conditions in the UK and Far
East, and saw its pre-tax profit decline 31 per cent in the year ended March
31 1993.
The result amounted to Pounds 409,000 compared with a previous Pounds
597,000 and was achieved from turnover of Pounds 34m (Pounds 35.6m).
The profit included Pounds 1m surplus on the sale of investment in Goodmans
Industries, Pounds 129,000 release of provision for closure costs of Xylo,
less closure costs of Audix broadcast activities. Interest charges were cut
to Pounds 418,000 (Pounds 690,000).
Continuing activities produced Pounds 33.7m (Pounds 32.4m) turnover and
Pounds 997,000 (Pounds 1.28m) operating profit in very tough market
conditions, said Mr Norman Crocker, chairman.
Improved market conditions could be detected in some parts of the business,
and new products had been launched or planned.
Costs had been reduced further and, provided the OEM volumes continued to
hold up, 'we have the ingredients for good profit growth in the current
year', he told shareholders.
After a tax credit, earnings per share were given as 2.9p against 2.5p while
the final dividend is 1p making a total of 1.5p (1p).

FT  26 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Good second six months helps to cut loss at
Arthur Shaw to Pounds 99,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECOND half at Arthur Shaw, manufacturer of builders' hardware and
supplier of engineering products, showed an upturn in all activities, and
the group cut its loss from Pounds 410,000 to Pounds 99,000 in the year
ended April 4 1993.
That was after exceptional charges of Pounds 221,000 (Pounds 113,000), so
the group traded at a profit of Pounds 122,000 (loss Pounds 297,000) from
turnover of Pounds 16.8m (Pounds 15.7m).
The exceptional item included Pounds 175,000 of various costs relating to
the extraordinary meeting called by rebel shareholders in February and
subsequent management changes.
Mr Brian Phillips, the new chairman, said the board had continued with a
programme of severe cost cutting and management rationalisation. All
divisions had implemented plans to expand sales, improve margins and enter
new markets.
He was conscious of the current financial position and steps were being
taken to reduce borrowings and gearing. Asset disposals were under constant
review.
The manufacturing division had gained substantial additional business in the
window hardware sector through increased market share, new products and
improved demand.
Losses per share were reduced to 1.58p (3.33p). There is no dividend against
an interim of 1.3p.

FT  26 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Reduced exceptionals boost LIG to Pounds
27.8m - Main business resilient to recessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CREDITABLE performance by London International Group's health and personal
products business was offset by a fall into losses in the photoprocessing
division, leaving annual profits down from Pounds 39.4m to Pounds 32.5m
before exceptional costs.
These costs were much reduced, though, at Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 22.5m). That
left the pre-tax profit for the year ended March 31 1993 at Pounds 27.8m, up
from Pounds 16.9m.
Exceptional items covered the closure of some photoprocessing facilities and
reorganisations costs within the health and personal products side.
The group said it had no further comment to make on the episode last month
when it was censured by the Stock Exchange for warning some analysts and
shareholders that profit forecasts were too high.
The result was at the lower end of revised expectations, and the shares fell
6p to 176p.
Mr Tony Butterworth, chief executive, said it was frustrating to have the
distraction of the photoprocessing losses when the health and personal
products activities - including condoms, toiletries, surgeons gloves and
household gloves - represented 90 per cent of group assets.
Turnover rose 4.5 per cent to Pounds 416m (Pounds 398.1m) and operating
profits were slightly down at Pounds 47.5m (Pounds 48.6m).
Within that the health and personal products activities increased profits by
20 per cent to Pounds 51.4m, with margins rising from 15.4 to 17.5 per cent,
but photoprocessing losses of Pounds 3.9m replaced profits of Pounds 5.9m.
Mr Butterworth said lower volumes and prices had hit ColourCare, the
photoprocessing business, and there was overcapacity in the industry. LIG
aimed to be the lowest cost processor and several million pounds of costs
had been cut from the business.
The benefits of that would be seen in the current year. The acquisition of
SupaSnaps had given the group nearly 30 per cent of the UK market, he said.
He said once recession ended the business was well placed to earn good
returns. The group would then take a strategic look at it which could result
in its sale or retention. The European industry was consolidating along the
lines of the US and UK industries, he said.
Meanwhile, the group's main business had proved resilient to recession in
the UK and US. He struck a note of caution though as markets in Germany,
Spain and Italy were now going into recession which could restrict sales
growth.
Geographical expansion was an important element of growth. In March the
Durex brand was launched in China.
The group reckons to have 35 per cent of the world market for branded
condoms. He said the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, currently looking
into pricing of condoms in the UK, was expected to report next February.
Biogel surgeon's gloves, launched in the US three years ago, had now got a
24 per cent share of the US market by value. However, a reduction of stock
in the distribution pipeline had held back sales.
Interest charges rose from Pounds 9.2m to Pounds 15m reflecting higher
borrowings and interest rates in countries where LIG borrows to hedge
assets, such as Italy. Year-end net debt was Pounds 128m
Mr David Harbut, the finance director, said the business had been close to
generating cash before acquisition and exceptional costs and these costs
would be reducing now. Cash generation to reduce debt was a priority, he
said.

FT  26 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Racing uncertainty faces Gosforth Park -
Chris Tighe details the problems encountered by plans to secure course's
future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY, the centenary running of the Northumberland Plate, 'the Pitman's
Derby' at Gosforth Park, is an historic high point for the quoted company
which has owned and run the Newcastle racecourse since 1882.
But despite this afternoon's celebrations, enhanced by a visit from the
Queen, these are worrying times for High Gosforth Park plc.
The green belt designation of the racecourse's entire 800 acre site,
acquired by High Gosforth Victorian founders 'to promote sport in a proper
fashion and get a fair return for their trouble and outlay' is proving a
stumbling block to the property development plans on which the company's,
and the racecourse's, future depend.
High Gosforth Park this month declared a Pounds 21,000 pre-tax loss for
1992, on turnover of Pounds 1.13m. The loss at the operating level was
Pounds 62,000.
Mr David Parmley, the managing director and clerk of the course, said that
over the last decade the company's retained annual profit averaged about
Pounds 20,000. Its reserves stood at only Pounds 100,000.
Despite its verdant setting and imposing listed buildings, the course, which
offers the only grade one racing between York and Ayr, is being run on a
shoestring. Essential maintenance bills are a constant worry.
'It's clear to anybody if this company doesn't get a lot of money quickly
it's down the pan,' said Mr Parmley. Only five of Britain's 59 racecourses
were making money from horse racing, he added. Many made ends meet by car
boot sales and land development.
High Gosforth Park argued at a public inquiry last year for planning
permission for housing and office development on several pockets of its
land. Sale of sites with planning permission would raise about Pounds 4.4m,
which it has pledged to plough back into improvements to course facilities
and refurbishment of its listed buildings.
The inquiry inspector recommended approval for nearly all the plans. But in
May Mr Michael Howard, then environment secretary, indicated he was minded
to reject the housing and offices, while supporting other elements. The
company was invited to comment. It is now hoping his successor, Mr John
Gummer, may accept its arguments for green belt development.
Without it, the future for Gosforth Park, ranked 12th and 14th respectively
on the levy board's flat and jump merit tables, was very bleak, said Mr
Parmley.
Its quoted status, unusual in British horse racing, is of little assistance.
A rights issue would be 'nonsensical', he said, given that the shares,
quoted at Pounds 35 each, passed the 1992 dividend and paid only 15p the
year before. Trading in the 90,960 issued shares is moribund.
The company has support, including sponsorship, from substantial regional
companies. The non-executive directors of High Gosforth Park include several
of the north east of England's great and good.
Scottish &amp; Newcastle is putting up Pounds 35,000 of the guaranteed Pounds
100,000 prize money for today's Plate, the 150th time the race has been run.
Back in 1833, when it was first held before moving to Gosforth Park,
Northumberland and Newcastle teemed with miners. Now, just one deep mine,
Ellington, clings on.
Mr Parmley has to hope the Plate will outlive the pitmen.

FT  26 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Restructuring at Rothmans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROTHMANS International and its subsidiary Dunhill Holdings resumed trading
yesterday after their parent, the Swiss-based Richemont, announced details
of its planned group restructuring.
Richemont proposed that its tobacco and luxury goods businesses be
reorganised into a pure tobacco company, Rothmans International, and a new
company, Vendome, to hold all its luxury brands.
That would be achieved through the merging into Vendome of Rothman's luxury
goods interests, held through Dunhill Holdings, and the ending of Dunhill's
separate stock market listing.
Under a complex restructuring, which needs approval from shareholders and
the Inland Revenue, the new companies will have dual holding company
structures and shareholders will own units of twinned shares in a UK and
non-UK company. This structure will shield overseas shareholders like
Richemont from UK advance corporation tax.
According to the terms of the deal, shareholders with 1,000 Rothmans B
shares would receive 1,000 new Rothmans units, 500 Vendome units and Pounds
757 cash. Holders of 1,000 Dunhill shares would receive 133 new Rothmans
units, 749 Vendome units and Pounds 443 cash.
The company intends to list the Rothmans units in London and the Netherlands
while the Vendome units would be listed in London and Luxembourg.
The cash element totalled Pounds 525m, of which Richemont will receive
Pounds 300m. Following the restructuring, it will own 61 per cent of
Rothmans and 70 per cent of Vendome.
The terms of the restructuring assumed a value for Cartier, Richemont's most
valuable division, of Pounds 2.1bn, valued on the basis of 18 times
earnings. Rothmans and Dunhill were given fully diluted market values of
Pounds 4.62bn and Pounds 661m respectively.
Shares in both companies fell because of profit taking and a suggestion that
some Dunhill shareholders might oppose the plan. Rothmans shares fell 28p to
692p while Dunhill dropped 23p to 383p.
Separately, Rothmans announced an 8.6 per cent increase in pre-tax profits
to Pounds 614m for the year to March 31. Earnings increased 10.7 per cent to
47.4p and a final dividend of 7.5p was recommended to make a total of 11.5p,
a 12.2 per cent increase.
Richemont announced a 5.1 per cent increase in profits to Pounds 651.9m
during the same period. Earnings per unit increased 5 per cent to Pounds
35.98 while a dividend of 588.75p is proposed.

FT  26 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Drug company raises Pounds 10m for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHIROS, a new company specialising in refining drug manufacturing
techniques, is expected next week to raise Pounds 10m from venture
capitalists and institutions ahead of a flotation probably early next year.
The placing has been arranged by Mr Chris Evans, a microbiologist and the
company's founder, and Mr Nowell Stebbing, a former co-ordinator of research
at Genentech and more recently Amgen.
Many pharmaceutical compounds, although chemically pure, are made up of
slightly different substances or isomers. Each has the same atoms but they
are arranged differently. Only one isomer will carry most of the therapeutic
activity. The other, because of the different structure, can have toxic side
effects, as was the case with Thalidomide.
Chiros has developed what it believes is a unique collection of technical
knowledge to isolate the beneficial forms to make purer drugs and
intermediary compounds for large pharmaceutical companies.
Mr Evans says Chiros is meeting a demand from the largest pharmaceutical
companies to produce new drugs, and to modify existing formulations, that
exist as single isomers.
There is some competiton, but he says Chiros is ahead of the field in the
difficult procedures required to make single isomers.
The shares are being placed with Schroder Ventures, Apax Partners, 3i Group
and Mr Evans, who provided the Pounds 3m seed capital when the company was
formed last year.
Mr Evans, who is chief scientific officer, says Chiros will pursue three
business strands. It will supply purer intermediary products to companies
like Glaxo and Wellcome and forcasts sales of Pounds 30m a year within six
years.
It will be involved in the clinical development of single isomer versions of
drugs that are now are only available in multi-isomer form. Chiros thinks
two drugs will have been launched and several others will be in late
clinical development within six years.
And it will try to develop new drugs for eventual licensing or clinical
development. Though no products are likely to be launched before 1999.

The Shield Group, which has estate agency and other property related

31, compared with losses of Pounds 1.37m.
The company said it was taking steps to wind up certain non-trading
subsidiaries in order to rationalise group operations. It should not have
any adverse effect on the overall profit or asset position.
Turnover fell to Pounds 2.07m (Pounds 10.6m). Losses per share came through

Vistec Group, which supplies computer systems, software and services, lifted
its pre-tax profit by 29 per cent in the year ended April 30 1993, from
Pounds 2.71m to Pounds 3.5m.
The increase was achieved from turnover 20 per cent higher at Pounds 38.7m
(32.3m).
Computer services continued to make headway with record profits and strong
cash flow. In general, trading improved primarily because new contracts were
won rather than margins increased.
Earnings per share rose to 2.07p (1.52p). The final dividend is 0.25p for a

<TEXT>
SHARES in Campbell &amp; Armstrong yesterday fell 4p to 17p after the shop and
office fitting group warned that it expected to incur after-tax losses of
Pounds 3.5m for the year ended March 31.
After omitting the interim dividend, no final will be paid. Last year's
total was 2p and reported net losses came to Pounds 595,000.
The company said that although the core shopfitting business returned to
profitability, turnover and margins for the construction-related activities
were seriously affected by the recession.
Action had been taken to reduce overheads and the disposal and closure of
some businesses should mean a return to profitability as economic conditions
recovered, it added. Current order book was in line with budgeted
expectations.
The company said it intended to publish the 1992/93 results - which have
been prepared under FRS 3 - on July 22. Also it planned to change the
company's year end to December 31.

FT  26 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Yorks Electricity reorganisation plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YORKSHIRE ELECTRICITY yesterday announced a re-organisation of its core
business as it disclosed a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds
156.3m and a 15 per cent rise in total dividends.
The shake-up involves the break-up of the main business into three separate
divisions - a system division or the 'true core' as the company calls it,
and network engineering and energy management - with the aim of it making it
more competitive.
Network engineering and energy management will work on a contractual basis
with the core, which will employ only about 330 people, against their
combined 3,200.
Mr Malcolm Chatwin, chief executive, said the company was preparing for
increasing competition which the industry regulator is promoting in areas
like meter reading.
The aim was to ensure that the businesses had every opportunity to compete
at market rates. 'It is about changing the culture,' he said.
In the year to March 31, Yorkshire increased earnings per share by 11 per
cent to 53.7p and the dividend to 20.42p from 17.76p, with a recommended
14.42p final.
The dividend rise was at the higher end of recs which have reported so far
for last year, but Mr John Tysoe, chairman, denied the company was in a
dividend race.
The company could not ignore sector norms, he said, but its policy always
had been to match dividend rises to earnings rises over the five year period
to 1995 and that remained in force.
Distribution profits rose from Pounds 135.3m to Pounds 136.2m and supply,
helped by a Pounds 36m cut in the value of debtors, from Pounds 8.9m to
Pounds 10.6m.
The company made provisions of Pounds 10m for the retailing joint venture
with East Midlands and Pounds 7.6m for distribution re-organisation costs
but, after write-backs for the previous year, total provisions were about
Pounds 10m.
Gearing fell from 15 to 7 per cent.
COMMENT
Long used to being one of the sector stars, Yorkshire has seen its rating
slip in the last month or so. There is nothing in these results to explain
the drop, one reason perhaps why the shares gained 5p yesterday to finish at
496p. Retailing profits stood still at about Pounds 1m, but that is
considerably better than other companies and by forming a joint venture
Yorkshire is better placed than others to pull out of stores if they do not
perform. The benefits of being among the first recs to tackle contracting
pay rates are showing through with a rise in profits from Pounds 400,000 to
Pounds 700,000. In the core business controllable costs, already down by 7.9
per cent in the last year, will benefit from the restructuring and further
job losses can be expected on top of the 328 of last year. All of this
should mean the shares, trading at a prospective yield of 5.9 per cent
assuming a dividend of 23.4p from Pounds 170m of profits, will at least
track the sector in the near future.

FT  26 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Hanson 'over zealous' on changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD HANSON, chairman of Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, yesterday
apologised to shareholders for 'over zealously' attempting to change the
articles of association which would have given him more power at annual
meetings.
Hanson withdrew the offending changes before yesterday's extraordinary
meeting after a number of large shareholders expressed their concern.
Asked by one whether the group's non-executives had agreed with the proposed
changes, Lord Hanson said: 'Not all the non-executives were able to go
through the fine print. It was presented to the board but we did not go
through the fine detail . . . that was a mistake.'
The six non-executive directors include Mr Simon Keswick, chairman of
Hongkong Land, part of the Jardine Matheson empire, Sir Christopher Harding,
chairman of BET and Mr Kenneth Baker, the Conservative MP.
Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive, said after the meeting that there had been
no question of Hanson 'trying to slip' the changes through the board without
the non-executives noticing.
However, he said it may have been the case that the executive directors had
been deficient in providing them with all the material necessary.
The extraordinary meeting was originally called to approve a scrip dividend
plan which requires the modification of the company's articles of
association.
At the same time Hanson proposed introducing a number of other alterations
to the articles designed 'to facilitate the orderly conduct of meetings' by
giving the chairman of Hanson's annual meeting (which is always Lord Hanson)
greater powers.
The changes would have limited shareholders' rights to nominate directors,
speak at annual meetings, call for votes at meetings and amend agenda items.
Lord Hanson said: 'Certain amendments that we proposed were misinterpreted
as a move on our part to restrict shareholders' rights at meetings. Nothing
could have been further from our minds. But since some of our shareholders
were unhappy with the proposed changes we decided not to proceed with them.'
Many of the group's US institutional shareholders were the most vocal in
their opposition to the proposed changes. Over the past two years the US
shareholding has increased from 9 per cent to almost 25 per cent of the
group.
In response to questions about the strike at 13 of the 29 mines at Peabody
Coal, one of the group's subsidiaries, Lord Hanson, said he would rather
'sit out the strike' than give in to intimidation.
The meeting yesterday approved the revised executive share option schemes to
bring them into line with the Association of British Insurers' current
guidelines.
A further extraordinary meeting to consider the scrip dividend plan will be
held on July 23.

FT  26 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Alliance Resources offer for Manx
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIANCE Resources, the US-based natural resources group suspended at 9 1/2
p since October, yesterday announced an all-share offer for Manx Petroleum,
a private company 29 per cent held by the quoted company's chairman.
The offer was accompanied by a placing and rights issue of Alliance shares
to raise Pounds 2.8m, the appointment of two non-executive directors and the
announcement of the all-share purchase of a further interest in a US
property.
Alliance has offered 13 of its shares for every one of Manx's, which were
trading at 50p on a matched bargain basis. The offer values Manx at Pounds
1.7m. Some 10 per cent of the enlarged company will be held by Alliance
chairman Mr John O'Brien, who is also Manx's managing director.
Mr O'Brien said the acquisitions would 'strengthen the company's position
and prospects considerably'. The funds would initially be used to develop
Alliance's assets in the US.
The last year has been an eventful one for the cash-strapped Alliance, which
was put into receivership by Manx following an attempt by directors to sack
Mr O'Brien last October.
Mr O'Brien had been appointed chairman in May 1992 following an agreement
with Alliance that it would eventually make an all-share bid for Manx.
The agreement, which was not made public to shareholders, also set out terms
for a Dollars 200,000 loan to Alliance and the payment to Manx of monthly
management fees of Pounds 10,000.
Manx called in administrative receiver, Mr Graham Wilson, when Alliance
failed to repay the loan on demand. Mr O'Brien was subsequently reappointed
chairman.
Yesterday's announcement means the number of Alliance shares will jump from
18.4m to 150m. The group proposes to place 44m shares at 5p to raise some
Pounds 2.2m, while a one for one rights issue will draw a further Pounds
920,000 before expenses.
Alliance also announced the appointment of Mr James Prior, currently a Manx
director, as non-executive chairman and Viscount Torrington, director of
Flextech, as a non-executive director. The group intends to apply for a
relisting of its shares in London and Toronto.

FT  26 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Cost cuts and sterling devaluation help ICI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR DENYS Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, yesterday
warned that his company's improved performance in the first quarter had been
the result of cost-cutting and the devaluation of sterling rather than an
improvement in the economic environment.
'While there are signs of economic recovery in some markets, including the
UK, the underlying business trends in Continental western Europe remain
poor. It is really too early to express definitive views regarding trading
prospects,' he warned. Pre-tax profits increased in the first quarter by 10
per cent.
Sir Denys warned that in trading terms, 1992 was a very difficult year
during which the world economic scene deteriorated. 'This has been a
desperately bad recession, deeper and wider than anything we have seen since
the 1930s,' said Sir Denys.
'But although ICI's performance has suffered in consequence, it compares
reasonably well with that of our international competitors in the chemical
industry and many other large multinationals,' he maintained.
Sir Denys defended the decision to maintain the dividend on the basis of the
actions taken over the last three years to strengthen the company, and given
the view that the industry was very close to the bottom of the chemical
cycle.
ICI closed its last plant manufacturing the ozone-depleting gases CFC 11 and
CFC 12 in April. The last factory making halon, another ozone-damaging gas,
would close during the autumn.
The shares closed down 4p at 695p yesterday.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Lucky numbers spell B-I-N-G-O: The game's popularity has
expanded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a warm Thursday evening this week, 1,000 people are hunched over their
bingo tickets in a converted 1930s cinema in Wood Green, north London.
The listed interior is freshly, if garishly, painted. The numbers shouted
out by the caller appear on screens around the room. Gone are the
traditional numbered ping-pong balls blown through a plastic tube; the
caller reads from a computerised random-number generator.
If the decor comes as a surprise to those expecting something shabbier, so
do the customers. There are plenty of the industry's traditional players:
elderly women. But there are also young couples, groups of women in their
20s and 30s, men with arms covered in tattoos. Those inside the club, part
of the Top Rank chain, are as racially diverse as on the streets outside.
The extension of bingo's appeal this week attracted a new entrant to the
industry. First Leisure, the 10-pin bowling, discotheque and tourist
attractions group, announced it was paying Pounds 19.9m for Nudge Leisure, a
private company with seven bingo clubs in the Midlands. First Leisure says
the increasing number of younger, more affluent customers makes bingo an
attractive investment. The group intends to open two or three new clubs a
year, creating a chain of up to 30 venues.
Bingo prospered throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, but declined as
unemployment rose during the early years of Margaret Thatcher's government.
The game began to regain popularity in the latter half of the 1980s, spurred
by improved facilities and bigger money prizes.
Last year the number of licensed clubs nationwide showed a net increase of
eight, bringing the total to 1,019 - the first rise since 1974. About 2.8m
people play regularly in the UK, according to the Bingo Association of Great
Britain.
Two large operators dominate the business: the Rank Organisation, with 163
clubs trading under the Top Rank and Mecca names, and Gala Clubs, owned by
Bass, which has 136 venues.
Although the chains' clubs are predominantly in converted cinemas and
theatres, both groups are focusing their investment on purpose-built bingo
centres on the outskirts of towns and cities, providing parking as well as
access by public transport.
Mr John Garrett, managing director of Rank's recreation division, says that
it is in the purpose-built clubs that the change in the bingo market is most
evident. At the group's newly-opened Southend club, which also offers a
Saturday night cabaret, the average age is 39. Thirty per cent of the
Southend customers are men.
The group says its bingo business has held up reasonably well during the
recession, with last year's total admissions of 35m up 2 per cent on 1989.
The average expenditure of Rank's customers per visit is about Pounds 13.50
 -including entry fees, bingo tickets, food, drink and amusement machine
spending. Spending has increased in line with inflation throughout the
recession.
Given the preponderance of older clubs, however, accounts of how bingo has
changed should not be overdone. The average age nationally is 53; and women
still account for 80 per cent of players.
Mr Ian Burke, Gala Clubs' chief executive, says many of the traditional
players have been a valuable resource during the recession. Pensioners on
fixed incomes have continued to play. The industry has been helped by female
unemployment rising more slowly than that of men, Mr Burke says.
Mr Nick Tamblyn, First Leisure's commercial director, says: 'The market
shift is gradual rather than something that's happening overnight.' Nor is
the social class of bingo players changing markedly. 'Let's not kid
ourselves that we're looking for the BMW set. We're not. But we are now more
geared to the car-driving visitor.'
Mr Tamblyn says that, together with snooker and 10-pin bowling, bingo is a
business where operators can rely on large numbers of people spending small
amounts of money, compared with other leisure pursuits such as foreign
holidays. When times are hard, bingo customers tend to cut down on the
number of times they play each week rather than stopping altogether.
Some appear to have cut down very little. Ms Jackie Quintin, a 33-year old
mother of four who won Pounds 425 at Wood Green on Thursday night, plays two
or three times a week. Persistence appears to pay off; last February she won
Pounds 1,200.
Far bigger prizes are available. At the newly-built Top Rank club in
Romford, Essex, about 700 players are attempting to win a prize of Pounds
49,354.13. Most of the prize is on offer as part of the National Game,
played every night and twice on Saturdays by 675 clubs around the country.
The clubs are linked by computer. The numbers come from a central random
generator at a centre near Heathrow airport.
The prize that night was won by a player at a club in Glasgow. There are
enough smaller prizes, from Pounds 50 upwards, however, to give everyone the
chance of winning something, sometime. Mrs Jan Jobson, a 26-year old
housewife, who plays at the Romford club once a week, won Pounds 1,000 last
November. 'It's addictive. Once you've won once, you've got to come back and
win again,' she says.
No gambling business can succeed, of course, unless customers lose more than
they win, but a Gallup survey of bingo players in 1991 found that only 4 per
cent had never won anything. A third said they had won more than 10 times.
Gaming legislation in the UK places severe constraints, however, on the
bingo industry's ability to market itself. All bingo players have to be club
members. Although membership is free, customers have to wait 24 hours after
being accepted before they can play. Clubs are only allowed to advertise
their venues to the public as social meeting places. They are not allowed to
say what prize money is available, even on the outside of the club.
Much of the broadening of bingo's appeal has been by word of mouth. Mr Jason
Derham, a 24-year old painter and decorator who plays at Romford once a
month, was persuaded to come by his girlfriend, whose parents had been
playing for years.
The plastic membership swipe cards, which players use to gain entry do,
however, provide clubs with marketing information which they use to target
customers directly. Members receive birthday cards from the club, as well as
offers such as a free drink on a particular night.
The Rank Organisation says it once noticed from the information provided by
the cards that a group of regular customers, all living in the same area,
had stopped coming. Further investigation revealed that a change in the bus
timetable had made it difficult for members from that area to reach the club
in time for the start of the session. When the starting time was made
slightly later, the customers began playing again.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Rebounds? No sweat: US sneaker makers face tough competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a wonderful week for Michael Jordan, America's best-known and
highest-paid sportsman, who led the Chicago Bulls to their third consecutive
National Basketball Association championship on Sunday night.
The 4-2 victory over the Phoenix Suns in the seven-game series was due in no
small measure to the 30-year-old's extraordinary athleticism. And the
hat-trick helped Jordan brush off media controversy earlier this month over
his enthusiasm for gambling.
It should also have been a great week for Nike, America's leading athletic
footwear manufacturer. Not only does it have Jordan under contract to
promote its products (paying him a reputed Dollars 10m to Dollars 20m a
year) but also Charles Barkley, a Phoenix Suns star known for his aggression
on the court.
Each player has his own Nike line - called Air Jordan and Air Force Max.
Basketball shoes are the largest single category of sporting footwear in the
US, accounting for some 29 per cent of the Dollars 6bn wholesale (nearly
Dollars 12bn retail) market, according to the Athletic Footwear Association.
'For Nike,' says one industry observer, 'the NBA play-off was a series made
in heaven.'
Yet Nike's week has been anything but a slam-dunk. Its shares fell sharply
after it warned that 1993-94 earnings were likely to be well below Wall
Street's expectations, and the market's gloom was compounded by a similar
statement the previous week from Reebok International, Nike's arch rival.
Both companies blamed general retail sluggishness in the US and recession in
Europe, while Reebok said its problems were compounded by weaknesses in its
line-up of basketball shoes this quarter.
But observers suggest other factors may also be at work, including pressure
on margins from intensifying competition in the mature US athletic shoe
market, and shifts in footwear taste among fashion-conscious young
Americans. The 1980s were the great boom era of the sports segment, as a new
generation of American companies, led by Oregon-based Nike and Reebok of
Massachusetts, rapidly overtook European rivals like Germany's Adidas by
offering shoes tailor-made for the fitness fads of the era, such as aerobics
and jogging.
The new shoes were not only comfortable on the feet but also looked stylish,
and the number of Americans buying them as fashion leisure wear quickly
outstripped sales to those trying to work up an athletic sweat. Today, only
one-third or fewer of US sneaker buyers use them for sport.
The boom plateaued at the start of this decade, owing partly to recession
but also to market saturation. The average American owns three pairs of
sneakers but, like mortals everywhere, has only one pair of feet to show
them off on.
So while sneakers now make up almost 40 per cent of the US footwear market,
the numbers sold last year dropped 1.8 per cent from 1991 and nearly 5 per
cent from the 1990 record of 393m pairs.
This maturity has encouraged the American manufacturers to focus much more
attention on foreign markets, which they reckon could be worth about double
the US one. Their brightest prospect is Europe, which seems gradually to be
adopting more casual shoe styles.
However, recession has temporarily put a damper on the European market, and
the effect on US companies' profits has been compounded by the recent
strengthening of the dollar against European currencies. At the same time,
the flat US market is producing much tougher competition at home, forcing
companies to trim prices to maintain market share.
This pressure on margins could intensify over the next few years, owing to
the growth of big new sporting goods superstores with the retailing muscle
to command keen wholesale prices. For example, Kmart, the discount stores
group, is building up a chain called Sports Authority, each branch of which
will sell up to 40,000 different items under one roof.
These forces seem likely to mean consolidation of the footwear industry,
since they favour the largest, best-capitalised manufacturers such as Nike
and Reebok.
So too do the concomitant pressures on the manufacturers constantly to come
up with better-engineered shoes in new designs and then pour tens of
millions of dollars into marketing them - particularly to the fickle young
Americans who make up a large proportion of their customers. For them, shoes
are as much a statement of personal identity as a means of locomotion.
Some analysts suggest that one factor in the sneaker manufacturers' sluggish
sales this summer may be a sudden, youthful enthusiasm (though still minor
in terms of the industry's revenues) for British-made Dr Martens shoes -
dour, military-style boots worn by the likes of singer Madonna and actor
Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Dr Martens complement the 'grunge' look, and are the antithesis of the
sports shoe, such as Nike's extremely light Air range. It was these
sneakers, and the endorsement of Jordan, which allowed the company to
recapture US market leadership in 1989 from Reebok, which had the title for
the previous three years.
Reebok has hit back with its 'pump' range, which allow air to be pumped into
a shoe for a better fit. But despite gains at the expense of smaller rivals,
Reebok still accounts for only 24 per cent of the market, compared with
Nike's steady 30 per cent.
Reebok is vowing to overtake Nike by 1995 and it has a new weapon - its Shaq
Attack range of basketball shoes, named after a 7 foot 1 inch young star
called Shaq O'Neal.
O'Neal is one of the most promising talents in the NBA, but he plays for
Florida's Orlando Magic, a team that is not based in one of the premier
basketball cities, and he has yet to win any important pennants.
And, as Michael Jordan can attest, when people are buying dreams as much as
a pair of shoes, nothing succeeds like a three-time champion.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Letter: No say on funds to Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KEITH DARLINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thank you for your excellent reporting of the Tory party funding fiasco
('Tories unsettled by funds secrecy', June 21).
I would add that it is also widely assumed that company donations are made
with the approval of shareholders. From my own experience, this is totally
false. For I have written, as a shareholder, to four companies which donate
large sums of money to the Tory party, seeking an opportunity to vote on
ceasing donations. In all cases my request has been rejected on the grounds
that the Tories serve companies' economic interests best.
Leaving aside the democratic rights of shareholders, such claims are
extremely dubious given the economic shambles the country is now in after 14
years of economic mismanagement. Indeed, I would go further and say it is
because the Tory party is so excessively funded that we are now so badly
governed. For if the events of the last 12 months tell us anything, it is
that a party that can buy its way to permanent power will become tired,
complacent, incompetent and unfit to govern.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Letter: Mortgage arrears a long-term problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From J J PLANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Cole of James Capel proposes the view that 'mortgage arrears gloom
is overdone' (Letters, June 23). May I suggest certain reasons for the
opposite view.
First, a very large number of mortgagors have had to 'capitalise' their
arrears over the last few years, under pressure from their lenders. These
cases will no longer appear in the official statistics as 'arrears' but as
additional lending (falsely inflating the figures for new loans). In the
short term, borrowers in this position are in the same position as those in
arrears, so far as their ability to spend money is concerned. However, such
borrowers (and their lenders) have transformed a short-term reduction in
spending power into a reduction over the remaining term of their mortgages
(often extended by the lenders to allow the repayment:income ratios to come
back into line with their standard lending criteria).
Second, published statistics on mortgage arrears rarely reflect the effect
of 'arrears charges' on the balances owed by borrowers in difficulties. Such
charges are in reality usurious, but are dressed up to avoid the usury laws.
Their impact on mortgage balances, and consequently upon spending power, may
be as much as 50 per cent of that of directly recorded arrears.
Third, the impact of severe wage restraint on the high proportion of
mortgagors who earn their livings in the public sector will ensure that the
overhang of debt and arrears is not rapidly cleared.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Letter: Danger to Baltic states of Sweden and Finland
joining EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From ROMAS KINKA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest the requirements for those central and east
European countries that at present have associated EC status to become full
members ('The Copenhagen summit', June 23). While it is relatively, if not
entirely, straightforward to determine whether a particular country has
achieved 'stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law,
human rights . . .', it seems to me that the requirement to have achieved
'the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the
Union' is like the proverbial piece of string.
I cannot but notice that one or two countries within the Union seem to be
having a spot of trouble in this regard. I note further that, if Sweden and
Finland join the EC, the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania,
which have associated status and are struggling to fulfil the requirements
as set out in the declaration, may suffer. The fear is that the EC will
force Sweden and Finland to cancel bilateral free-trade agreements with the
Balts which have helped their economies to such a large degree since their
independence.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Man In The News: Superman, or just a grey man of steel -
Brian Moffat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something about the way Brian Moffat has reached the chairman's
office at British Steel that resembles the ascent of another 'man who came
from nowhere' - Prime Minister John Major.
Like the prime minister, Moffat's public persona was scarcely visible when
he added the job of chairman to that of chief executive - a step he says
British Steel never intended to take. But his profile is higher after a week
which saw him lambasting state subsidies in Europe and 'ostriches' in the US
 -Big Steel and its unions.
Like Major, too, Moffat owes a considerable debt to a predecessor whose
style could hardly be more different: the ebullient Sir Bob Scholey. A man
with a legendary temper and an ability to arouse strong emotions has given
way to a man who inspires respect but is described as reticent and aloof.
'I don't smile too much,' says Moffat, who has been silver-haired as long as
anyone at British Steel can remember. 'But at times it's been grim. Perhap's
there'll be more opportunity to smile as things pick up.'
The analogy with Downing Street should not be pursued too far: Thatcher went
because she was pushed; Sir Bob served out his contract. Moffat, aged 54 and
named chief executive in 1991, took on the additional role of chairman this
year after the new non-executive chairman, Sir Alistair Frame, resigned for
health reasons.
Moffat's style may contrast with Sir Bob's but his message - spelled out on
Monday as the company announced a Pounds 149m annual pre-tax loss - picks up
many of the same themes: free markets, level playing fields, cost control,
competitiveness; above all, the refrain, 'We've cut capacity, now it's
somebody else's turn.'
But a big question remains: does Moffat have the political skills and the
charisma for the top job?
Running British Steel is a highly political task. The company may have been
privatised in 1988, but no big integrated steelmaker can operate in a
vacuum: witness the outrage in Scotland last year over the final closure of
the Ravenscraig plant, this week's dispute over US anti-dumping duties, and
the tortuous progress of the European Commission's restructuring plans for
the industry.
Some observers believe British Steel might appoint another non-executive
chairman to replace Sir Alistair, but the ideal solution, says Moffat, would
be for him to remain chairman and a new chief executive to be appointed from
within the company.
The City would prefer the roles to be split, but at present British Steel is
sticking with Moffat in both. 'Two institutions have raised the question,'
he says. 'We've seen one and written to the other. We've had understanding
replies.'
One role or two, British Steel characteristically makes no attempt to puff
up the image of its chairman, who is no self-promoter. The company's bald
biographical note does scant justice to his career.
Born and raised in Scotland, Moffat is a chartered accountant who joined the
former British Steel Corporation in 1968, a year after it was nationalised,
from Peat Marwick Mitchell. Starting as deputy controller, finance, at head
office, he moved through a succession of posts before becoming managing
director of finance in 1986.
Moffat's big break - especially for an accountant - was his appointment by
Scholey in 1976 as director of the sprawling Port Talbot works in South
Wales. 'Bob Scholey was never frightened to use youth, and neither have I
been,' he says.
Moffat spent 10 years at Port Talbot, weathering the national strike in
1980, cutting jobs from 13,500 to 4,700, and masterminding its restructuring
and capital spending programme. 'We rebuilt it from end to end, turning
something that was third class into a first-class plant,' he says.
By this stage, he says, he enjoyed making steel more than being an
accountant, and he was initially reluctant to go back to head office as
managing director, finance. But the move gave him the opportunity to become
involved with the 1988 privatisation of British Steel, and established his
strong reputation in the City.
Three years later, Moffat's ascent through British Steel received a surprise
boost. Martin Llowarch, destined to be chairman, resigned suddenly as chief
executive and Moffat replaced him.
Today, as chairman and chief executive, Moffat retains his strong reputation
in the City, but a succession of reduced or passed dividends and the
difficulties over EC restructuring and US trade friction raise the question
of whether the job is too big for him - or for any one person.
One consultant familiar with British Steel calls the decision to combine
both posts 'scandalous . . . Moffat is a very good chief executive, he's a
tough son-of-a-bitch, but he doesn't have the vision to be a chairman'. Sir
Alistair's departure, he says, not only gave British Steel a chance to
retreat back into its shell, but robbed the company of a chairman with
immense experience in dealing with politicians.
Moffat responds: 'If the whole burden of British Steel rested on my
shoulders, that would not say much for its management depth. I can bring the
company the benefit of my experience and set the agenda. Other people will
have to carry it out.'
And his vision of the future? Moffat may be an accountant-turned steelman,
but his message to long-suffering shareholders suggests he has not gone
entirely native. 'I'm not interested in making steel, I'm far more
interested in making money,' he says. 'We've been cutting costs very
seriously since 1980, now we've got to concentrate on the revenue side.'
This means raising prices, improving the product mix and further enhancing
quality. To satisfy the doubters, the man who came from nowhere has to prove
that he is a somebody on the public stage and that he can deliver on this
strategy.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Letter: Gatt can only survive if it widens its remit to
include social clause
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr DENIS MACSHANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Buchan writes that the idea of a social clause in the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is 'presumably that unions would push up
labour standards, and thus costs, in developing countries'. ('France's
four-letter word', June 21). The idea is far simpler. It is that unions,
once able to operate in conformity with the conventions agreed by
governments, employers and unions over decades at International Labour
Organisation tripartite gatherings, would be able to push up internal
purchasing power, hence demand.
It is a system that worked first for North America, then for west Europe,
and then for Japan between 1945 and 1980, and follows the law of
subsidiarity, as it allowed institutions of different countries to find
their own way to solve the problem of wealth creation and distribution. High
internal demand supported by high wages usually goes hand in hand with low
unit costs, and free trade. A Gatt social clause was not needed for the US,
Japan and west Europe, as all three economic centres played by the rules of
economic and democratic pluralism - including the former authoritarian
states of Spain, Portugal and Greece when they joined the EC.
Unfortunately, the new world economic players, notably those in Asia, want
to write new rules to guarantee their positions as export platforms while
denying economic pluralism internally. Gatt will only survive if it widens
its remit to include a social clause, and the EC leaders in Copenhagen
should ask not how they can make European worker-consumers poorer by cutting
labour costs but how they can make the world's worker-consumers richer by
increasing their ability to buy the goods and services they make.

Sir, It was clever detective work by you to discover the solution to the
mystery being investigated by Inspector Morose in the BT3 campaign.
Unfortunately, though unravelling the clues, you made one serious error:
Inspector Morse is one of Central Television's many successful dramas and
not Thames's, as Observer said ('BT3 - the end', June 23).
I fear you are destined to continual walking on the beat without any

FT  26 JUN 93 / Ghosts in the machines: Disputed transactions between UK
banks and their customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Of late, Steven Raw has become something of a seer around the streets of
Nelson. When 23-year-old Mr Raw sees people brandishing plastic cash cards
in the Lancashire town, he cautions of the fate that could befall them.
'Everyone I see around town now, I warn. I say 'Watch what you are doing
with those cards.' You cannot be too careful.'
Mr Raw, a worker at a medical fabrics company, speaks from bitter
experience. He is in dispute with Barclays Bank over Pounds 600 withdrawn
from his account through automated teller machines, the 'holes in the wall'
on which banks increasingly rely to dispense cash. The dispute arrived in
the London high court this week after two years of acrimony and suspicion.
Mr Raw is not alone in arguing with his bank over whether someone else took
his money. This week's judgment that nine people with similar claims against
banks and building societies can proceed with a mass legal action threatens
to provoke a flood of disputes. Banks face being haunted by 'phantom
withdrawals'.
His dispute is typical. It started two years ago when he received a three
page Barclays statement listing a series of withdrawals from cash machines
that he did not recall making. He still had his card, and he says he had not
told anyone else the four-digit personal identification number (Pin) with
which he identified himself when using his Connect cash card.
He went to his local branch to complain, and met with an upsetting response:
the bank did not believe him. It had records of transactions, and its
technical experts believed it impossible for anyone who did not know Mr
Raw's Pin to break its codes and take his money. Mr Raw found suspicion
falling on himself and his girlfriend.
'I went mad with them. I went down there thinking it was a computer error,
and they would just credit it back but they said it must have been me,' he
recalls. The dispute got harsher, until Mr Raw had a piece of luck. His
parents saw a television news item about a firm of Merseyside solicitors
pursuing phantom withdrawal cases.
Things took a better turn after he contacted the firm, J Keith Park, which
took up his case.
Barclays wrote to Mr Raw offering to refund Pounds 425 of the disputed
amount, citing the code of practice introduced last year, and which limits
customers' liability in most cases to Pounds 50 of the disputed sum.
There are two reasons why the banks have taken such a stern attitude on
disputed transactions.
First, they are becoming increasingly reliant on cash machines as they close
branches and switch staff away from being cashiers towards selling other
products such as insurance. TSB is among banks experimenting with
sophisticated ATM machines on which customers can carry out transactions
such as switching money between accounts.
Although cash machines accounted for only 4 per cent of money transmission
 -or 1bn transactions  - in 1991, the banks calculate this could quadruple
by the year 2000. This means that they are wary to acknowledge that such
machines could be fallible.
'The biggest worry about this affair is that there could be a breakdown of
trust,' says one banker.
The second reason is that the banks find a true case of 'phantom' withdrawal
inconceivable. This would be a case where a thief managed to extract money
from someone's bank account without knowing the Pin number of their cash
card. The reason is that banks' security effort has above all been directed
at ensuring that it is impossible to crack Pins.
'It puzzles me totally,' says Mr Paul Dorey, head of information security at
Barclays. 'Machines can make mistakes, but it is beyond the world of
possibility that our systems could make up transactions in the way this
implies.'
In Barclays' case, Pin numbers are generated by a computer at the centres
where cards are manufactured, and are transferred to the central computer
against which transactions are checked. They are not seen by staff, or coded
on the magnetic strip on the back of cards. The only person who sees both
the card and the Pin number is the account holder to whom they are sent
separately.
When the customer presses the Pin into the ATM keypad, an electronic 'black
box' encrypts the number so that it cannot be intercepted, and sends it to
the mainframe ' via another computer if the ATM is owned by another bank.
The computer decrypts it and sends an authorisation message. The cash
machine records each transaction on paper roll.
Mr Dorey argues that it would take four sets of software to go wrong
simultaneously in the same way to record a falsely authorised transaction.
Fraud would require someone either to know the Pin, or to break the code
encryption. The latter has never been known, according to Mr Richard Tyson
Davies, of the banks' Association for Payment Clearing Services.
For these reasons, the first reaction of banks has often been to accuse
customers either of fraud, or of carelessness. Banks say that most cases of
'phantom' withdrawal into which they inquire turn out to be relatives or
friends of the customer who have discovered the Pin.
Yet despite the banks' denial of the possibility of pure 'phantom'
withdrawal, they are having to admit that incidents that look very like it
have occurred. One example is staff fraud. In a notorious case, a Clydesdale
Bank computer engineer stole Pounds 17,000 by recording Pins on a portable
computer as the bank's customers used ATM machines.
More broadly, there have been cases where cash withdrawals have been applied
to the wrong account.
Among the cases being pursued by J Keith Park is one of a man whose card
took cash from someone else's account, apparently because the wrong magnetic
strip had been placed on the back.
The washing of such dirty linen in public is one effect of the mass action,
which banks believe could take up to three years to settle. It has yet to be
decided in what form, or in what courts, individual cases will be argued.
While banks fear a loss of confidence in cash machines, an even greater
worry might be a wave of similar claims. On this point at least, the banks
and their opponents are united in scepticism.
One reason is the banks' decision to change their code of practice, limiting
customer liability to Pounds 50, except where a customer has been 'grossly
negligent' by disclosing a Pin number.
A second reason is that banks are working on reducing errors and fraud.
Barclays has announced that it is to install cameras at six of its cash
machines, and banks are working together on innovations such as
'watermarking' the magnetic strip on cards to prevent fraud.
But even if there is no rush of claims, the treatment of customers such as
Mr Raw has ensured that they face a damaging dispute. Mr Dorey of Barclays
says Pin numbers need to be 'treated with respect'. Yet banks are paying the
price for not having treated customers that way. 'They told me their
machines were foolproof, but I know otherwise now,' says Mr Raw.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Steady hand at the centre
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS MR John Major's accident- prone government sheds one minister here and
another there, Mr Kenneth Clarke looks a reassuringly solid figure in the
storm. Within less than a month of taking office as chancellor, he gives
every sign of being in charge and invulnerable. Yet his chief achievement to
date lies less in the field of economics than in presentation. He has
succeeded, remarkably, in giving the appearance of candour while offering no
obvious hostages to fortune.
In a government that is singularly short of political finesse, this talent
is not to be underestimated  - especially when the demands of the electorate
have to be reconciled with the requirements of the markets. But as Mr Clarke
himself has implicitly acknowledged, this is the easy bit. He has arrived in
the job at the optimal moment in the electoral cycle. His predecessor had,
after a fashion, grasped many of the more difficult nettles. And it is clear
that a recovery is well under way.
This week the Central Statistical Office revised upwards its estimate for
non-oil GDP in the first quarter to reveal an annualised rate of growth not
far short of 3 per cent. The personal sector is beginning to cheer up a bit.
The household savings ratio, whose high level played a large part in
prolonging the recession, is now coming down fast, from 11.3 per cent in the
final quarter of last year to 10.3 per cent in the first quarter of 1993.
The unemployment figures have pleasingly defied the precedent set in the
recession of the early 1980s, by falling in line with the upturn in economic
activity.
The corporate sector's balance sheet, meantime, has been substantially
tidied up. In the first quarter of the year its financial deficit was almost
down to zero. Unit labour costs have been falling at a very un-British rate,
thereby adding to the competitiveness of industry's exports and giving stock
market analysts a good story to tell. Even the broad definition of money,
M4, has been accelerating in recent months, suggesting that something might
just be stirring in the bowels of a hitherto quiescent monetary system.
Time to talk
Against that background Mr Clarke has been right to talk rather than to act.
It is not unreasonable to wait until the strength of the recovery can be
more accurately gauged before contemplating a cut in interest rates. The
more so, since a cut before the Christchurch by-election would severely
diminish his credibility in the markets, while antagonising Britain's
partners in the European Community. Having failed to persuade the Germans to
embark on a co-ordinated cut in interest rates this week, the French, who
face mounting unemployment and growing pressure for protection, would be
enraged by any such move after last September's devaluation of sterling.
Yet the test will come in due course. Mr Clarke describes himself as
belonging to the 'hard centre'. He claims to be pro-growth, but
anti-inflation; both pro-Europe and in favour of free markets; and a
proponent of enlightened social reform, whose Midlands background entails
sympathy for the manufacturing businesses on which Thatcherite politicians
used to pronounce anathemas in the 1980s. Yet the elements in this seemingly
attractive cocktail are not all readily reconcilable. The first signs of
where the potential difficulties lie are beginning to emerge.
Spending round
For all the recent ministerial rhetoric about a fierce public spending
round, Mr Clarke has made it clear that there will be no reduction in
spending below existing targets, despite the forecast public sector
borrowing requirement of Pounds 50bn. After the big increases in public
spending since Mr Major became prime minister, we will have more modest
increases, but increases none the less  - notwithstanding the Portillo
review and calls by social security secretary Mr Peter Lilley for a public
debate on the future of the welfare state.
In Mr Clarke's judgment that is the most that can be achieved by a
precarious government with too many dissidents on the backbenches. He is
probably right. He could also point out, as Goldman Sachs has done, that
public spending is actually lower in relation to GDP than it was when the
economy emerged from the recessions of the early 1980s and the mid-1970s.
There is a problem with revenue. Hence the chancellor's controversial
warning in his interview with the FT this week that he will be ready to
raise taxes in his November Budget unless recovery brings a faster reduction
in government borrowing.
If taxes are increased, then the chancellor will no doubt be tempted to
rebalance monetary policy simultaneously. A chancellor whose sympathies lie
in the Midlands might well see merit in taxing consumption, while relying on
interest rate cuts to help shift resources into exports and investment. But
to tax consumption, if the recovery looks weak, will require a great deal of
courage. We shall know the potency of Mr Clarke's cocktail in a matter of
months.

FT  26 JUN 93 / High-tech goes hands-on: New biometric weapons against fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses through fraud at automated teller machines are small change compared
with the broad sweep of plastic card fraud which cost Britain's banks Pounds
165m last year.
But winning the battle against all card fraud is the chief aim behind an
impressive range of technological weapons being developed by financial
institutions and their technology suppliers.
Sending transaction details from the ATM, or point-of-sale device, to the
bank is now thought to be secure thanks to 'black boxes' which encode the
information and self-destruct if tampered with.
The greatest problem is verifying that a card holder is the person that he
or she claims to be.
Customers in future may have to present a finger tip or an entire hand for
inspection by an electronic 'eye' incorporated in the ATM. ('Fingerscan'
rather than 'fingerprint' is the preferred term these days among bankers
concerned about possible complaints of infringement of civil liberties.)
Facial structure, voice, the pattern of blood vessels in the hand, or the
back of the eye are all fair game for the emerging science of biometrics,
which reckons to make positive identifications of individuals through unique
measurements. Video cameras no larger than a computer chip make such
measurements a practical proposition.
To inspire confidence in both retailers and cardholders, however, a system
of biometrics would have to be both convenient and reliable. None of those
so far tested meets the banks' minimum standard  - of not more than one
false diagnosis in 100,000 transactions. More stringent criteria may be
needed in future.
According to Mr Paul Rogers, UK product manager for NCR, the US company
which leads the world ATM market (but designs and makes them in Dundee,
Scotland), the UK banks will continue to rely on the familiar and
inexpensive magnetic strip cards and personal identification, or Pin,
numbers, but are likely to add a biometric element. Measurement of hand
dimensions is a popular option because the details can be stored in the card
itself.
'Smart' cards, containing a microprocessor, are difficult to forge and can
hold substantial amounts of information about the cardholder including, say,
an electronic facial image. They cost, however, several pounds, compared
with pence for a magnetic stripe card.
Customers leave more than fingerprints when they shop. Banks in the US are
already using pattern recognition software which detects changes in a
customer's shopping habits. If a habitual teetotaller seems suddenly to
start buying red wine, for example, it could indicate that a stolen card is
being used for the purchases.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Dethronement of the D-Mark: The German currency's weakness
in the ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not an excuse to sing the Marseillaise, says Mr Jacques Delors,
president of the European Commission. But recent cuts in French, Dutch and
Belgian interest rates, which occurred independently of any relaxation of
monetary policy by the Bundesbank, were, he thought, a comforting example of
European co-operation. They were certainly a demonstration of D-Mark
weakness.
That short-term interest rates in currencies closely linked to the D-Mark
can fall below those in the D-Mark is not surprising, at least in theory.
Since the exchange rate mechanism permits fluctuations within the bands of
up to 2.25 percentage points, deviations in short-term interest rates can
occur, in response to cyclical divergences, even when parities are expected
never to be realigned.
None the less, what is happening is unprecedented. Three-month interbank
interest rates in Dutch guilders have been below those in D-Marks since
January 1992. Recently, however, the guilder has been joined by the Belgian
and, more significantly, by the French franc (see chart).
Moreover, the official intervention rate of the Banque de France has been
cut eight times since the parliamentary elections in March, the last time
this week, to rest a quarter of a percentage point below the Bundesbank's
discount rate. Yet the D-Mark remains among the weaker currencies in the
ERM.
It is no longer, it seems, fanciful to talk of the French franc as joint
anchor of the ERM. But can one conclude that the D-Mark might cease to be an
anchor altogether?
The Bundesbank would certainly deny this. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank's president, recently congratulated the French on their
achievement. But he also stressed that the Bundesbank had 'kept the D-Mark
stable for 40 years and intends to go on doing so'.
Mr Schlesinger is soon to retire, while his designated successor, Hans
Tietmeyer, is more internationally minded. But he knows that his influence
depends on the strength of the D-Mark.
The view in the markets is far from apocalyptic. Yields on German bonds have
risen since April. But they remain rather low by historical standards. Among
ERM currencies, only Dutch bonds have lower yields than German ones. Outside
the ERM, just two currencies, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, are
regarded as far better long-term bets than the D-Mark.
The D-Mark may no longer be the undisputed king of European Community
currencies. But it remains co-regent. The markets do not expect it to
depreciate in the long term against its core ERM partners or, for that
matter, dramatically against the US dollar. They forecast further gradual
cuts in short-term D-Mark interest rates. Core ERM currencies are expected
to depreciate against the yen, the US dollar and even sterling in the short
term, but to decline significantly only against the yen, among the main
currencies, in the longer term.
Things might go wrong with this complacent scenario in two ostensibly
contradictory directions. The first possibility is renewal of doubts about
the ability of the French, in particular, to stay the course. While French
nominal interest rates have fallen, real French short-term rates are around
5 per cent. The French unemployment rate is forecast by the European
Commission at 12 per cent in 1994, while economic recovery is also expected
to be modest.
Mr Philippe Seguin - leader of the anti-Maastricht tendency in the Gaullist
party and president of the National Assembly - has already challenged the
franc fort policy of the government. With the presidential elections due in
1995, it is easy to envisage renewed doubts about French willingness to
tolerate high real interest rates. No wonder France wants Germany to accept
co-ordinated cuts in interest rates.
The second possibility is that D-Mark weakness would prove both long term
and ultimately uncontrollable, even by the Bundesbank. This apocalyptic view
has been advanced by the investor, George Soros.
The case is not difficult to make. Germany's total public sector borrowing
requirement is 7 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product, among the highest
in Europe. Germany has the second highest inflation in the group of seven
leading industrial countries and the fifth highest in the European
Community.
German labour costs are out of line, especially for a country whose true
level of unemployment (allowing for short-time working and other make-work
schemes) is already above 5m, or more than 13 per cent of the labour force.
According to data collected by Morgan Stanley, West German labour costs per
hour are the highest in the world, while east German labour costs more than
Japanese and American labour and is 10 times more expensive than in
comparable former communist countries, like the Czech Republic.
This seems unsustainable. After unification Germany did need a short-term
D-Mark appreciation, in order to help transfer resources to east Germany
that were previously lent abroad, via the current account surplus. This
adjustment seems to have largely occurred, partly through nominal
appreciation of the D-Mark (notably after the summer of 1992) and partly
through higher German inflation than in partner countries. In the longer
term, however, Germany needs depreciation of the real exchange rate, in
order to restore its competitiveness.
There are two routes to enhanced competitiveness: depreciation and
competitive disinflation. The former can occur easily enough vis a vis
currencies against which the D-Mark is floating. Against core ERM
currencies, however, nominal depreciation would imply downward realignment
of the D-Mark. This the Bundesbank would presumably resist to the death.
Germany does two-fifths of its trade with countries whose exchange rates
have remained fixed against the D-Mark. None the less, it could obtain
sufficient overall real depreciation if the core of the ERM were to
depreciate substantially against currencies outside it.
Such a general depreciation of the core currencies of the ERM would be more
than welcome to France, since it could combine fixity of the bilateral
exchange rate against the D-Mark with enhanced overall competitiveness.
It might not be good enough for the Bundesbank, however, which is more
likely to want to preserve a strong D-Mark. Moreover, even to sustain D-Mark
credibility within the ERM, underlying German unit cost inflation must be no
higher than in other core ERM countries. For this reason, the German central
bank is certain to strive for underlying inflation as low as in any other EC
member country.
Unfortunately, this may prove infeasible, since disinflationary German
monetary policies are normally matched, willy nilly, by other countries in
the ERM. A vicious circle of competitive disinflation could result. One
escape from such a collective downward spiral would be a sharp decline in
German relative inflation, which looks unlikely. Another would be
substantial German fiscal tightening, which looks more unlikely. Yet another
escape would be a further collapse in German credibility, allowing far lower
short-term rates in other ERM countries than in Germany, which looks less
likely still. A final escape would be a jump to monetary union, which looks
least likely of all.
Markets may well be too complacent about ERM stability. Abandonment by the
Bundesbank of the effort to push German inflation down to levels achieved
elsewhere in the ERM is one threat, since this would undermine the D-Mark's
position within the ERM. But continued efforts by the Bundesbank to push
German inflation down could be equally dangerous, since it would reinforce
the recession in the heart of the European economy and enhance French
anguish. There is no easy way out.
The currency markets are, in fact, seeing a slow motion clash between an
irresistible force - German unification - and an immovable object - the
Bundesbank's commitment to a stable D-Mark. The Bundesbank may be defeated,
as Mr Soros expects. If it is, Europe's monetary scene would indeed be
transformed.
The battle to restore credibility to the D-Mark is certain to inflict
continued pain on everyone. Germans may no longer be able to sing D-Mark
uber alles. But a year from now, nobody in France is likely to sing the
Marseillaise over the defeat of the D-Mark, even in their baths.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Clarke opposes further year of 1.5% pay limit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE will resist the imposition for a further year of a firm
1.5 per cent ceiling on public-sector pay. But the chancellor has refused to
pre-empt an expected cabinet debate on the issue by ruling out entirely the
extension of compulsory pay restraint.
In his interview this week with the Financial Times the chancellor said that
a second year of rigid pay restraint across the public sector would increase
the risk of a damaging bounce-back when the ceiling eventually was lifted.
Mr Clarke issued a warning  - repeated yesterday on BBC Radio  - that he
would be ready, if necessary, to raise taxes in his November Budget. There
was a predictably angry reaction yesterday from some rightwing Tory MPs.
Mr David Shaw, chairman of the Conservative back-bench finance committee,
said that another round of higher tax increases would be unacceptable to
most MPs. He called instead for further reductions in spending.
But the chancellor told the FT he saw little prospect of squeezing further
the overall spending targets agreed by the cabinet for the next three years.
The targets, the toughest since the early 1980s, allow for growth in
spending of less than 1 per cent a year after allowing for inflation.
Mr Clarke said the history of pay norms suggested that 'they do tend to
succeed in the first year.' But he added: 'Holding them thereafter has all
sorts of downsides, including the inflexibilities and so on which they
introduce. We're also very committed to making sure there is no catching on,
no bounce-back after the restraint. The longer you keep it on the more . . .
the dangers become.'
His view is said to be backed by Mr John Major. But Mr Clarke is aware that
several cabinet colleagues believe that it may be impossible for the
government to hold to their departmental spending limits unless it maintains
a clear line on public-sector pay.
Signalling what is expected to be an intense debate in the cabinet committee
charged with dividing up the spending total, Mr Clarke said: 'There are a
whole lot of programmes where making a judgment about the pay is very
important to the spending round . . . I don't think we're going to come to
any decisions about what to do on pay, whether to do it programme by
programme; do it across the board; what to do; until we're well into the
spending round.'
That left open the possibility that the government might opt to replace next
year the present rigid ceiling on actual settlements with a looser, but
pre-announced, limit on the public-sector pay bill.
The chancellor used his interview also to stress that he intends to pay much
closer attention to the concerns of industry in framing his first Budget. Mr
Clarke said he wanted to 'engage' industrialists in discussion of the
overall stance of economic policy. He would seek also to 'test' his own
ideas for tax and other changes affecting business in a regular dialogue
with the captains of industry.

FT  26 JUN 93 / News at Ten pledge demanded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Independent Television Commission is to demand that the eight ITV
companies which proposed keeping News at Ten at its traditional time when
they applied for new licences should stick to their commitment.
The companies have since said they want to move ITN to an earlier slot so
that films and dramas can be shown without interruption after 9pm.
Sir George Russell, ITC chairman, and the other members were unanimous on
Thursday that News at Ten was a cornerstone of quality on ITV. They intend
to do everything they can to keep it at its present time.
The stance means that a clash between the ITC and the ITV companies seems
likely, although no formal proposal of any kind has yet been put to the
commission.
A formal proposal to move News at Ten will go before the ITV council on July
5 with 6.30pm the current favourite time.
ITV has to show the programme in prime time, which is defined as being
between 6pm and 10.30pm.
If the commission is able to hold even one ITV company to a promise to
retain News at Ten, that could be enough to prevent the programme moving.
The rules state that the main news programme should be broadcast
simultaneously throughout the ITV system.
There is no doubt that Sir George is prepared to take tough action to
maintain what the commission views as quality in ITV.
Some ITV chairmen are happy to use the threat of News at 6.30 as a lever to
win a compromise  - News at 10.30.
This too will be resisted by the commission, which believes that 10.30 is
too late to begin the flagship news programme. If the commission stands firm
on News at Ten the issue could end in the courts.
All the ITV companies which supported News at Ten in their applications  -
some with qualifications  - have received, or will receive, letters from Mr
David Glencross, the commission's chief executive, asking why they have all
apparently changed their minds only six months into new 10-year broadcasting
licences.
ITV argues that the proposal for an earlier evening news is part of a
detailed review of the entire network schedule. According to ITV analysis,
between 10pm and 11pm it loses its lead to the BBC  - in May, for instance,
ITV's audience share fell to 35 per cent compared with 46 per cent in the
previous hour.
The ITV companies argue that an earlier main news plus an extra bulletin,
probably at 11pm, would result in more evening news on the network.
TSMS, the UK's largest television airtime sales house, clients of which
include Central and Anglia, yesterday signed a co-operation deal with the
Paris-based Information et Publicite for advertising sales and research
across Europe.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Revival forecast for construction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'long and painful' recession in the construction industry appears to be
coming to an end, the latest forecasts from industry leaders show.
These indicate that construction output is expected to fall by only 0.5 per
cent this year  - just a quarter of the fall it had forecast previously.
The joint forecasting committee for the construction industry  - drawn from
a cross-section of construction, building materials, banks, and financial
and industrial companies  - expects construction output to rise by 0.5 per
next year and 2.5 per cent in 1995. This would follow a fall in output of
almost 10 per cent in 1991 and a decline of 5.5 per cent last year.
The improvement in outlook had been caused entirely by a bigger rise than
expected in housebuilding and residential repair and maintenance.
The figures were prepared by Construction Forecasting and Research, which
was previously sponsored by the National Economic Development Office. Its
forecasts are regarded as one of the best guides of the industry's
expectations.
The organisation said yesterday that private-housing activity was expected
to increase by Pounds 600m this year, 'leading the UK construction industry
out of its two-year slump'.
Its findings are supported by construction order figures published by the
Department of the Environment which this week showed that contracts won by
construction companies from February to April rose by 10 per cent compared
with the previous three months.
Orders were also 1 per cent higher than during the corresponding period last
year.
The improvement, however, is patchy, and Construction Forecasting and
Research warned that areas of construction other than housebuilding were
likely to remain depressed.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Changes urged over tied agents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR BRYAN CARSBERG, the director-general of fair trading, yesterday called
for a change in the way life insurance products are sold.
The Office of Fair Trading has proposed to the Treasury a regime where
commissions on the sale of life products would have to be disclosed. This
follows scrutiny of the new rules made by the Securities and Investments
Board after last year's Retail Regulation Review.
Sir Bryan, presenting the OFT's annual report yesterday, said part of the
problem faced by consumers in making wise choices among products and life
companies was caused by the polarisation in the industry between tied agents
and independent financial advisers.
He said: 'At present, you either have to retail the product of one company
which means you are a tied agent, or else if you deal in the products of
many companies you are categorised as an independent adviser. It seems to me
that is a restriction on the market place and it would be preferable to
avoid it.'
He suggested the creation of a category called multi-supplier retailers.
They would be able sell the products of many companies without holding
themselves out as providing independent financial advice.
Sir Bryan said his first year at the OFT had been very active. Although
merger activity remained low last year, with the OFT recommending referral
to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission of just 125 mergers - 40 per cent
of the 1988 figure  - the number of monopoly inquiries had increased.
Relations with Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, had
remained good even though he had sometimes gone against Sir Bryan's advice.
Co-operation with Brussels was also working well.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Local government review may be speeded up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is likely to speed up the review of local government
structure in England, Mr David Curry, the new local government minister,
said yesterday.
Both Sir John Banham, the chairman of the Local Government Commission, and
local authority associations have called for the government's policy
guidelines to be changed. Mr Curry says this could be done by allowing
districts themselves to propose amalgamations and by making clearer the
government's requirements on cost-effectiveness.
Mr Curry, speaking after giving a speech to the conference in Bournemouth of
the Association of District Councils, dismissed calls to abandon the review
process as 'not a real option'. But he added that the guidance would be
changed if that would help all interested parties to reach agreement and if
it speeded up the review, which is predicted to last until 1997.
He said that such a long process 'really would be difficult to live with'.
Mr Curry added: 'I am willing to try to come up with a formula which most
people are prepared to live with. Sir John himself is saying he would like
to review the way the commission goes forward.'
The commission's initial recommendations include controversial proposals for
unitary authorities in Derbyshire and Somerset, but Mr Curry said there was
quite a strong chance that the 'final shape may be some distance' from the
original suggestions.
Mr Curry emphasised in his speech to the conference that he had an open mind
on the review. But he repeated warnings made by Sir John that district
councils should be realistic and avoid disputes with county councils about
the future structure of local government.
He said: 'The purpose of making local government as effective as possible is
to deliver the services that people want at the price they want to pay. It
is not about the competing claims of vested interests.'

FT  26 JUN 93 / BT offers 'price list' for rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications yesterday proposed a 'price list' of charges for
rival operators to gain access to its network, to avoid the need for
detailed negotiations in each case.
The idea is BT's response to plans published this month by Oftel, the
telecommunications regulator. Oftel wants rival operators to have a right of
appeal to it if they believe BT is overcharging them.
The number of BT competitors is increasing rapidly, so the terms on which
they gain access to BT's network are critical to the future shape of the
industry.
BT wants to publish two price lists. The first would cover services over
which it has in effect a monopoly, such as the use of local networks in most
of the country. Prices would be set in agreement with Oftel but with no
right of appeal for competitors.
In the second list, covering services for which competition exists  - such
as trunk lines  - prices would be set by BT on a market basis, with no role
for Oftel at any stage.
BT argues that appeals to Oftel 'involve a considerable administrative
burden and result in still further delay and uncertainty for both parties'.
Mr Ray Smith, BT's director of carrier services, said: 'Our proposals
provide a predictable, open and fair method of setting and making available
interconnection charges.'
Competing carriers needing access to BT's network are unlikely to support
the proposal to deny them access to the regulator in cases of dispute.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Baker sues Daily Mail on Nadir allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH BAKER, the former Tory party chairman and cabinet minister,
yesterday issued a writ against the Daily Mail in the first legal response
to allegations made by Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman.
His action represents an escalation of responses to Mr Nadir after Mr John
Major, the prime minister, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, said he should 'put up or shut up'. Mr Philip Conway of Wright
Webb Syrett, Mr Baker's solicitors, confirmed the libel action against the
Mail's allegations that the MP sought funds from Mr Nadir during a visit to
Conservative Central Office while he was Conservative party chairman.
Mr Conway said Mr Baker had 'absolutely no recollection' of this discussion
on the one occasion he met Mr Nadir  - at a meeting which he said Mr Nadir
had requested.
Mr Ivor Cole, legal director of Associated Newspapers, which owns the Daily
Mail, said: 'We have only just received the writ. We have no comment at the
moment.'
Meanwhile, in interviews on BBC Radio yesterday, Mr Nadir stressed his
innocence while refusing to provide any new evidence to support any of his
allegations.
'I hope you understand that a person is innocent until he is proven guilty,'
he said. 'So everybody has to presume I am innocent until my guilt is
proven.'
Mr Nadir said he accepted it was wrong of him to skip bail last month, but
said: 'I had no other alternative whatsoever.' He said the gift of a watch
from Mr Michael Mates had kept him sane.
He said his donations to the Conservative party had been disclosed in the
accounts of a northern Cyprus subsidiary of the company, although the
administrators to Polly Peck International say some money came from PPI and
not the subsidiary, called Unipac.
It also emerged yesterday that investigators examining the circumstances in
which Mr Nadir broke his Pounds 3.5m bail and flew to northern Cyprus
believe that he himself masterminded his escape from justice and that there
was no big conspiracy involved.
His escape is believed to have been organised at short notice, within the
week leading up to his departure from a small airstrip at Compton Abbas in
Dorset.
Police are thought  - as a result of inquiries over the past two months  -
to have ruled out suspicions that there might be a 'Mr Big' other than Mr
Nadir behind the escape.
But investigations continue into the money to pay for Mr Nadir's escape and
into several individuals who are suspected of having acted as accomplices.
Police want to interview two businessmen, Mr David Hamilton and Mr Peter
Dimond, who accompanied Mr Nadir on the final stage of his flight to
northern Cyprus.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Tenth of pupils play truant
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE IN 10 pupils in England plays truant at least once a week in the GCSE
exam year, a report commissioned by the Department for Education said
yesterday.
The survey found that nearly a third of pupils aged 14 to 16 had played
truant at least once in the preceding half term. The main reason cited by
truants was dislike of lessons, particularly physical education, games and
French. Their main complaints about lessons were that they did not enjoy
them, found them irrelevant or too hard, or disliked the teachers.
Most truants  - 58 per cent  - wanted to stay on at school. A third found
school enjoyable and a third actively disliked it. The report is based on
questionnaires issued to more than 37,000 pupils in their GCSE and pre-GCSE
year in 150 English local authority schools.
The report says the situation was worse than results showed because many
truants would have been absent from school when questionnaires were handed
out.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Manx timeshare rules to be tightened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Isle of Man authorities yesterday announced plans to regulate timeshare
activities, Sue Stuart writes.
Although hardly any timeshare businesses operate on the island they
frequently use Manx companies or trustees. A working party recommended that
the island's rules go further than the UK Timeshare Act in terms of consumer
protection.
The Manx government hopes the proposed legislation will eliminate the bad
publicity the island receives from media coverage of alleged malpractice in
timeshare operations involving Manx companies.
The proposed EC directive for the conduct of timeshare business will not
necessarily by implemented by the island, which is a self-governing Crown
dependency and is outside the EC. The Manx government expects to place draft
legislation before parliament by the end of the year.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Vineyard loses champagne ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORD 'champagne' must be taken off bottles of a fizzy, non-alcoholic
drink being marketed as 'elderflower champagne', the Court of Appeal ruled
yesterday.
The court allowed an appeal by the French champagne producers, led by
Taittinger, against a High Court ruling that although the label on the
bottles of the elderflower drink was 'a misrepresentation calculated to
deceive', the risk of damage to the reputation of genuine champagne would be
nil or minimal.
The French were granted injunctions banning Thorncroft, a Surrey-based
vineyard, from 'passing off' its product by use of the word 'champagne' and
from breaching European Community regulations designed to protect wine
producers from the misleading use of their exclusive appellations.
Sir Thomas Bingham, Master of the Rolls, said no one with knowledge of wine
would be deceived by the elderflower drink, even though it was sold in
champagne-style bottles with wired corks. However, any product which was not
champagne that was allowed to describe itself as such must 'inevitably erode
the singularity and exclusiveness of the description 'champagne', and so
cause damage of an insidious but serious kind'.
Sir Thomas said Thorncroft was anxious to use the word champagne because it
imported 'nuances of quality and celebration, a sense of something
privileged and special. But this is the reputation which the champagne
houses have built up over the years and in which they have a property
right.'
Allbev and Thorncroft Vineyard, which make and market the elderflower drink,
plan to appeal to the Lords.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Safe Sir John emerges from twilight: PM's choice of a
replacement for Mates has avoided a reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE appointment yesterday of Sir John Wheeler, the lofty and deeply loyal MP
for Westminster North, as Ulster security minister signalled determination
by Mr John Major to play safe in replacing Mr Michael Mates.
By plucking Sir John from the back benches, the prime minister avoided a
wider ministerial reshuffle. He also rewarded an MP who, since he entered
parliament in 1979, has seemed unwilling to cause unnecessary waves in
Westminster or Whitehall, even when chairing the influential Commons home
affairs committee.
There is a logic to his appointment, nevertheless. Sir John is an aficionado
of security, crime prevention and policing policies. He was assistant
governor at Brixton and Wandsworth prisons before entering parliament. As
chairman of the Commons committee he had intimate knowledge of the work of
the Home Office.
Sir John, 53, has affinities with Mr Mates, who resigned this week after
embarrassment over his links with Mr Asil Nadir. Both served lengthy
back-bench apprenticeships and were passed over by Mrs Margaret (now
Baroness) Thatcher because of perceived political wetness.
Both have a slightly pompous air. Mr Mates was ex-Army. Sir John would be an
archetypal 'knight of the shires' if his constituency was not in London. He
was knighted in 1990, and became a privy counsellor this year - usually the
rewards of a loyal, long-serving Tory MP not expected to enter the
government. Slim but ponderous, Sir John has a near-permanent look of
disdain and is far from garrulous, snapping yesterday at television cameras
when asked who he had voted for in the 1990 Tory leadership election. The
twist in Sir John's career was his toppling from the home affairs committee
last year. Government whips were anxious to end the tenure of the
troublesome Mr Nicholas Winterton, Conservative MP for Macclesfield, as
chairman of the health committee. They therefore decided that MPs should not
serve on a committee for more that three parliaments. But they appeared to
forget the implications of that ruling for the equally long-serving Sir
John.
Ministerial office will be adequate compensation - in spite of the
oppressive personal security and the frustrations of working in a province
bedevilled by more than two decades of terrorist violence and political
intransigence.
Sir John's first priority will be to win, as far as possible, the confidence
of unionist and nationalist politicians. To do both is difficult, if not
impossible. Unionists want ever tougher measures; many back internment
without trial of terrorist suspects. Nationalists lack confidence in the
security forces.
Sir John is regarded as generally liberal on law and order, and has opposed
hanging terrorists. So any radical change in government security policy is
unlikely.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Grants to employers on disabled to be halved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT grants to companies to help them to meet the extra costs of
retaining employees who become disabled are to be halved under new rules.
At present, employers can obtain specialist equipment on free loan, grants
for adaptations, help with extra costs of fares to work and 'readers' for
blind employees.
From April next year companies will have to make a 50 per cent contribution
towards help for employees who have worked for them for six months or more.
The employer's contribution will be capped at a level yet to be announced.
The Employers' Forum on Disability, members of which include the high street
banks, B&amp;Q and Wellcome, said yesterday any measure that 'discourages
employers from developing positive policies on retention (of disabled
employees) is very worrying'.
The Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation (Radar) said the
move 'makes no sense from a government which claims to want to keep people
in work'. It said many employers would not be prepared to pay more to retain
disabled staff.
Mr Archy Kirkwood, Liberal Democrat spokesman on social security, said the
government had 'again chosen to attack the most vulnerable in society'. The
move would increase employers' costs and jeopardise disabled people's jobs,
he said.
The Department of Employment said yesterday there was 'no question of a
budget cut' in the Pounds 13m a year being spent on measures for disabled
people at work. The government aimed to widen access to grants and put more
resources into getting disabled people into jobs, it said. The scheme
benefits 8,000 to 9,000 individuals a year.
Under the new rules, the department said, companies would be expected to pay
the cost of one-off items of equipment or help costing less than Pounds 100
for employees with six months' or more service. Employers would not be asked
for any contribution for new recruits or employees who had worked for them
for less than six months.
There will also be a ceiling on grants for each disabled person over a
five-year period. Radar said the ceiling would particularly hit those
receiving recurring payments such as help with fares to work.
Both Radar and the Employers' Forum welcomed other changes in the rules
meaning that, from next month, unemployed deaf people will be able to get
help towards the cost of 'communicators' at job interviews. Grants will also
be available towards the cost of personal assistants for employees with
other disabilities.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Videos tackle cash-card mystery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPERIMENTS using video cameras in banks' cash dispensers have failed to
find evidence that 'phantom withdrawals', where funds vanish from a
cardholder's account without their knowledge or permission, are caused by
faulty technology.
In every case tested, the cameras pictured the cardholder or a close
acquaintance withdrawing the money.
This week a judge cleared the way for a mass legal action against banks and
building societies by customers claiming to have lost money through phantom
withdrawals.
Banks and building societies  - including Bank of Scotland, Barclays Bank,
Midland Bank and Derbyshire Building Society  - are experimenting with video
systems to counter accusations that errors in cash dispensers or main
computer systems are responsible for the mystery withdrawals.
The banks have consistently denied that their technology could be at fault
in spite of instances of cash machines breaking down.
Bank of Scotland has been testing videocameras in some of its 390 machines
over the past year. There was a small but significant number of 'phantom
withdrawals', but in no case was the technology found to be at fault. In
each case the withdrawal had been made by a forgetful cardholder, or by a
member of the cardholder's family or a family acquaintance without the
cardholder's permission. Tests by Derbyshire Building Society showed similar
results.
Cameras are not likely to become widespread. Video capability adds some
Pounds 1,500 to the cost of a cash dispenser and there are some 18,000 in
the UK, suggesting a bill for the banks of Pounds 27m.
Cash dispenser fraud costs only about Pounds 3m annually.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Rosyth fears almost 1,000 jobs will be lost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGERS at the Rosyth dockyard believe the number of jobs to be lost over
its failure to win the Trident refitting contract may be more than double
the 450 stated by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary.
Mr Allan Smith, managing director of Babcock Thorn, the company that runs
the yard, said it was likely that nearly 1,000 jobs would be lost there. The
yard employs 3,700 people.
The dockyard, however, said it was too early to give an exact figure for the
number of jobs that would go.
Workers and management at Rosyth reacted angrily to a statement by Mr Mike
Leece, managing director of Devonport Management in which he said Devonport
would be interested in taking over the Rosyth yard if the government put it
on offer. He said he thought Devonport Management could make a better job of
running Rosyth than Babcock Thorn.
Babcock Thorn said: 'Mr Leece has totally failed to understand the process
we have been going through for the past six months. The Ministry of Defence
does not want one company to have a monopoly. We have every intention of
staying at Rosyth.'
While awarding the Trident contract to Devonport, Mr Rifkind announced that
Rosyth would be allocated refitting work on 18 big warships. These would
include two aircraft carriers, one of which would be Ark Royal, and eight
Type 42 destroyers. The remaining 50 per cent of the surface-fleet refit
work would be open to competitive tender.
The size of the award of surface-ship work to Rosyth has dismayed
private-sector shipyards which now see fewer opportunities to bid for
refitting work. Sir Robert Easton, chairman of Yarrow, the GEC-owned
shipyard in Glasgow, yesterday expressed his disappointment at the size of
the cake now likely to be on offer.
But others said Scotland would benefit in another way from Thursday's
decision. Weir Group, the Glasgow-based engineering company, owns 30 per
cent of Devonport Management and would be expected to work on refitting the
pumps of Trident submarines at its plant in Glasgow.
While Mr Smith called for a period of stability for the yard after the
intense lobbying of the past few months, politicians and businessmen in Fife
demanded that the government set up an independent review of Thursday's
decision to award the Trident contract to Devonport.
Mr Henry McLeish, Labour MP for Fife Central, said the government had to
realise that it had a fight on its hands. Mr McLeish, a shadow Scottish
Office minister, said any review should consider Rosyth's last-minute
proposal to cut the cost of refitting Trident at Rosyth by Pounds 70m by
using an emergency dock.
That submission was rejected by Mr Rifkind, who described it as 'quite
unreasonable'.
Scottish sources close to the dockyard battle believe the last-minute offer
put extra pressure on the government and considerably increased the amount
of surface-ship repair work which the Scottish dockyard has been awarded.
It is understood that Rosyth's surface-ship allocation was completed in
telephone calls between the Ministry of Defence and the dockyard as late as
Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning, and may even have been doubled in
that period.
Before yesterday's announcement, some of those campaigning to save Swan
Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder, had expressed concern that a political
carve-up of Navy work between Devonport and Rosyth could do further damage
to Tyneside's marine industry by disadvantaging ship repairer A&amp;P Appledore.
But yesterday A&amp;P Appledore, which also has repair yards at Falmouth in and
Southampton, said Thursday's announcement did not affect the company. That
was because Rosyth had been given warship, rather than support vessel, work.

FT  26 JUN 93 / MoD agrees to frigate extension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ministry of Defence has agreed a further fortnight's extension of work
on the three Type 23 frigates being fitted out by Swan Hunter, the Tyneside
shipbuilder's receivers said yesterday, Chris Tighe writes.
The extension, which runs until July 9, is the fourth since Swan Hunter went
into receivership in mid-May after failing to win a crucial helicopter
carrier order.
Completing the frigates would give the company work until late next year and
improve its chances of winning new orders and finding a buyer as a going
concern.
Price Waterhouse, the firm acting as receivers, said yesterday that it was
'very optimistic' that a long-term agreement would be reached with the MoD.
The firm said it would be achieved during the coming fortnight. The
complexity of the agreement, caused by Swan Hunter's receivership, is
understood to have caused the delay.
Mr Tommy Brennan, Tyne chairman of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and
Engineering Unions, met receiver Mr Ed James yesterday together with Swan
Hunter shop stewards.
Mr Brennan said the unions were bitterly disappointed that a final agreement
to let the frigates be finished on the Tyne had still not been achieved with
the MoD.
He said: 'Rosyth has been given work for over a decade, yet they're making
such heavy weather of giving an agreement for 12 months' work.
'It's totally astonishing that different rules apply in different places.'
The latest agreement means that the shipbuilder's remaining 1,800 employees,
in spite of having work for the next fortnight, continue to face
morale-damaging uncertainty.

FT  26 JUN 93 / US urges Japan to fulfil pledge to open markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN should normalise its economic relations with the rest of the world by
redeeming unkept promises to cut its trade surplus and open its markets, Mr
Lawrence Summers, US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs,
said yesterday.
Mr Summers, in a speech to Japanese business leaders, defended the Clinton
administration's insistence on results-oriented trade agreements.
The speech was a comprehensive statement of US economic policy towards Japan
ahead of two days of talks, starting tomorrow, aimed at setting up a
framework for substantive discussions on trade disputes in areas such as
supercomputers and motor parts.
Mr Summers made plain that the US would not soften its call for targets to
measure progress in opening the Japanese market.
The US proposals have been widely criticised as managed trade policy
requiring the Japanese government to intervene to ensure foreign producers a
guaranteed share of a specific market.
Mr Summers said Japan's selective engagement with the world economy created
two problems  - the large trade surplus and low foreign penetration of the
Japanese market.
Foreign producers faced obstacles in Japan which they did not face
elsewhere, he argued. The clearest sign of that was Japan's low level of
manufactured imports, as well as low levels of foreign investment.
Mr Summers denied he was seeking managed trade agreements to help
uncompetitive US companies. He said Washington was focusing on sectors in
which US producers found it difficult to establish themselves in Japan even
though they outsold Japanese rivals in third country markets such as Europe.
The US was interested in Japanese markets which were not open to competition
because they were influenced by government procurement, ruled by a regulated
monopoly, such as telecommunications, or where there were close relations
between manufacturers and suppliers which excluded new entrants.
Mr Summers said: 'We are seeking to un-manage trade in areas where it is
already heavily managed.' He said the US agreements with Japan would help to
foster the multilateral trading system by making Japan's trading practices
conform more to international norms. To measure the openness of Japan's
markets, the US would employ benchmarks commonly used in anti-trust rulings
and trade agreements.
He added: 'We are not proposing hair trigger retaliation against Japan based
upon a single market share indicator in support of uncompetitive US
industries.'
The US wants Japan's current account surplus cut within three years to 1.5
per cent of gross national product, the 20-year average, from about 3.5 per
cent at the moment, largely through a higher public spending and lower
taxes.
Mr Summers said the extra Japanese demand for imports would create between
1m and 2m jobs elsewhere in the world.

The threat of widespread industrial action at Hyundai, South Korea's largest
conglomerate, appeared to recede yesterday, raising hopes that the country
will not be convulsed by labour strife this year, writes John Burton in
Seoul.
Workers at Hyundai Precision, a container and jeep manufacturer, who
initiated labour action within the giant industrial group on June 5, agreed
to return to work after they gained concessions on job conditions following
the mediation of the labour minister, Mr Rhee In-je.
Daewoo also faces industrial action, but the government hopes that
resolution of the Hyundai disputes will persuade Daewoo workers to drop
their proposed action.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Bonn threatens deportation of Kurd separatists
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TURKS and Kurds clashed in the streets of Germany yesterday, prompting
officials to threaten deportation as a way to prevent Kurdish separatists
from importing their war to German soil. Turks and Kurds, who have lived
side by side for decades, expressed concern that Thursday's attacks by
Kurdish militants in 16 German cities could inflame anti-foreigner sentiment
and set back their campaign for more civil rights and protection from
neo-Nazi extremists.
Meanwhile the German government yesterday promised tougher security for
Turkish property after harsh criticism from Ankara that they had failed to
protect Turkish targets from a wave of attacks by Kurdish separatists. The
militant Kurdistan Workers' party (PKK) claimed responsibility for the
attacks on Turkish missions, banks and travel agencies across western
Europe, and for holding hostages for 14 hours in the Turkish consulate in
Munich.

NIGERIA'S military President Ibrahim Babangida pledged yesterday to install
a democratically elected president on August 27, the date originally
scheduled for the handover to civilian rule.
It was not immediately clear how General Babangida planned to implement his
promise and he provided no further details.
A presidential spokesman suggested he would authorise a rerun of last
month's presidential elections, which he annulled earlier this week.
The US said yesterday it did not trust assurances he would soon turn the
country over to elected officials. Mr Mike McCurry of the State Department
said: 'Given the events most recently, there will have to be much more proof
in the pudding before we rely on those statements.'
The US has cancelled about Dollars 1m (Pounds 667,000) in non-humanitarian
aid to Nigeria and is reassessing all aspects of relations with Africa's
most populous country.
Gen Babangida, who seized power in a 1985 palace coup, made his pledge
yesterdayafter briefing senior military and police officers on the outcome
of a meeting of his top military-civilian council. Later his spokesman said
the decrees authorising the transition to civilian rule 'had been suspended
and not repealed', leaving open the possibility he may be having second
thoughts.
'We shall install a democratically elected government on the 27th of August
for this country,' Gen Babangida saidin Abuja, the federal capital.
But his remarks, ahead of an address to the nation, gave no clear indication
he was prepared to reverse his decision to annul the June 14 presidential
poll which pitted Moshood Abiola against Bashir Tofa, or to order the
election to be held again. Mr Abiola emerged the comfortable winner.
'We are committed to democracy,' Gen Babangida said. 'We are committed to
our democratisation process. . . We shall install a democratically elected
president that will meet the aspirations and the yearnings of our vision of
Nigeria of the 21st century.' Dressed in full military uniform, he said he
would address the nation today. 'I am going to tell you how we intend to do
it.'

FT  26 JUN 93 / Jakarta places travel ban on bad debtors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Indonesian government has imposed a six-month overseas travel ban on
more than 300 businessmen amid growing concern at the size of the bad debt
carried by Indonesia's state banks.
The identity of those affected has not been published but all have bad debts
with the state banks of at least Rp250m (Pounds 80,000).
Government officials say the travel ban complements a recent confidential
report into the worst of the state banks' corporate debtors conducted by
Bank Indonesia, the central bank, and the attorney general's office.
An unauthenticated copy of the report, circulating in business circles for
the past week, indicates that 26 leading companies  - many politically
well-connected, including three led by relations of President Suharto  - are
not servicing loans totalling Rp6,900bn from six state banks.
Bank Indonesia has refused to confirm the report despite intense questioning
of Mr Sudradjad Djiwandono, central bank governor, by members of the
parliamentary finance committee this week.
He has publicly maintained the official line that the banking sector's bad
debts  - including both state and private banks  - amount to only Rp3,500bn,
while many of the companies cited in the alleged report have denied they are
in default to the state banks.
Total outstanding credits of the sector are about Rp130,000bn, of which
state banks account for 55 per cent.
Executives of private banks, however, believe the sector's non-performing
loans may be as high as Rp20,000bn.
The World Bank, which last year made a Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m) loan to
help recapitalise the state banks, described the banking system in Indonesia
as 'under strain' in a report last month.
Indonesian cabinet ministers have pledged to tackle the bad debt issue,
regarded as a potential Achilles heel of an otherwise robust economy.
However, the central bank report, if true, will leave President Suharto  -
who has proven averse in the past to acting against businesses he considers
loyal to his regime  - with some difficult decisions.
Economists fear the travel ban will affect only relatively minor debtors
while more influential people, who are better able to service their loans,
will be allowed to move freely.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Political funding: the rewards and the pitfalls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, JUREK MARTIN, TOM BURNS, CHARLIE LEADBEATER, BERNARD
SIMON, DAVID WALLER and ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT a UK construction company which is one of the Conservative party's
biggest donors, one executive went on the offensive this week.
Commenting on the row which has flared in parliament and the press over
corporate contributions to the Tories, he declared: 'Take a look at Italy,
or even the good old US,' he said. 'By comparison, what happens in the UK is
tiny.'
The executive's point is partly justified. The dispute in Britain centres on
what the Labour party calls a Pounds 15m 'credibility gap' - the difference
between the Conservative party's declared total of Pounds 19m in donations
during the run-up to the 1992 general election, and the Pounds 3.7m in
publicly disclosed contributions, detailed in companies' annual reports. The
rest comes from undisclosed individual and foreign sources.
The gap is indeed small compared with the Pounds 1bn-plus hole in the
accounts of the Italian parties, which are at the centre of financing
scandals which have undermined the country's political structure.
In the US, trading cash for influence is an accepted part of the political
system. Ex-President George Bush awarded a dozen ambassadorships to members
of Team 100, individuals who had given at least Dollars 100,000 to the
Republican Party. Ms Pamela Harriman, the English-born widow of the US
statesman Averell Harriman, gave about Dollars 75,000 (Pounds 50,000) to
Democratic candidates last year, and is now US ambassador in Paris.
In the main industrialised countries there are a plethora of reasons why
parties give  - or do not give  - to political parties, but Britain has been
some way down the list of countries where malpractice is prevalent.
In Italy, there is often a precise and mutually beneficial relationship
between payments to political groupings and rewards in the shape of extra
orders. Mr Carlo de Benedetti, the chairman of Olivetti, the computer and
office equipment group, has recently denounced as 'racketeering' the routine
payments of Italian companies to pay kickbacks to political parties to win
contracts. He says his company was forced to make such payments to win
orders from the posts ministry.
Total bribes and kickbacks paid annually by Italian companies to win
contracts have been estimated at L5,000bn to L6,000bn (Pounds 2.2bn-Pounds
2.64bn), much of which has ended up in the pockets of the political parties.
Fiat, the big motor group, has brought in a code of conduct forbidding
payment of kickbacks by its employees. If such initiatives prove workable,
they would have a dramatic effect on Italian business life.
In the US, too, restructuring of party financing is on the political agenda.
For 20 years the most efficient means of disbursement has been via political
action committees (PACs), which 'bundle' together and pass on contributions
from individuals and special interests either directly to candidates or, to
get around ceilings on such donations, to the two political parties.
President Bill Clinton wants to ban PAC contributions and stop the
transmission of such so-called 'soft money' to candidates. His bill to
reform campaign finance has already passed through the Senate without
substantive alteration. Mr Clinton and Mr Bush each got Dollars 55m (Pounds
37m) from the federal purse, plus about another Dollars 10m from their
respective parties, to fight their campaigns last year, but refused to
accept PAC contributions. Mr Ross Perot, the maverick free enterprise
candidate, paid for his own campaign  - about Dollars 70m.
Sometimes, corporate attempts to gain a hold over the levers of power can go
disastrously wrong. In Japan, which has one of the most extensive networks
of legal and illegal payments linking big companies and the government
party, the most obvious failure was the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal. In the
hope of gaining influence, the company illegally donated at least Y500m
(Pounds 3m) to Mr Shin Kanemaru, the disgraced power-broker of the Liberal
Democratic Party. The company has since had to be financially restructured,
while the executives involved are on trial for breach of trust. Mr Kanemaru
had to resign, and is facing tax evasion charges.
In Canada, which has well-developed rules for disclosure, many of the
largest contributors  - to both political parties  - are businesses which
have a poor public image and are thus under threat of political action (such
as the big banks and the tobacco companies).
In Spain, corruption involving channeling of funds to state authorities and
party interest appears to be endemic in the construction industry. 'It is
part of everyday life, built into the business you could say,' said a senior
executive in a leading construction company.
Germany's Siemens electrical group has been caught up in allegations of
payments of at least Pta825m (Pounds 4.23m) to a group of Spanish
intermediaries linked to the ruling Socialist party. Siemens' prize was to
clinch a Pta100bn contract in 1989 to provide electrification along the
471kms of high-speed train tracks that link Madrid and Seville.
Siemens says the payments were bona-fide commissions representing an agreed
percentage of the final contract.
In France, which like Spain has had its share of recent funding scandals,
companies are coy about their political contributions  - although greater
disclosure will be required next year under a recently-passed law. Mr
Bernard Arnault, chairman of Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH), the French
luxury goods group, who describes his company's gifts as 'extremely modest,'
says the rationale behind them is: 'You can't separate yourself from the
life of the nation.'
In similar terms, Deutsche Bank, one of the largest donors in Germany, says
it gives money to all parties 'to support democracy.' The chairman of its
supervisory board, Mr F. Wilhelm Christians, said recently the bank had
given no money to the opposition Social Democrats 'because they didn't ask.'
Sometimes, big companies can think of good reasons not to give money. BASF,
the German chemicals giant, says loftily it makes no donations to political
parties because 'it is part of the company's culture to be neutral.'
Sir Patrick Sheey, chairman of BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial
services conglomerate, says it makes no donations in the UK because 'as a
multinational that stands you in better stead.' In Canada, however, BAT's 42
per cent owned associate Imasco, is one of the country's largest political
contributors, giving about CDollars 48,000 (Pounds 25,000) each to the
Liberals and Conservatives in 1991.
Cynics might note that Imasco owns Imperial Tobacco, which has a 66 per cent
share of the Canadian cigarette market; whereas in the UK, BAT sells no
cigarettes.

USA
Donations come through political action committees, which raised Dollars 65m
last year. Largest contributor was 'Emily's List', which paid Dollars 6.2m
to get more women elected to Congress. Other big donors were the National
Association of Realtors (Dollars 3.0m), American Medical Association
(Dollars 2.9m), International Brotherhood of Teamsters (Dollars 2.4m),
Association of Trial Lawyers (Dollars 2.4m), National Education Association
(Dollars 2.3m), United Parcel Service (Dollars 1.5m), AT&amp;T (Dollars 1.3m).
JAPAN
The Keidanren federation of employers associations agrees about Y13bn of
Liberal Democratic Party funding each year, which is then parcelled out to
industry federations and companies. 1992 donations by companies included:
Oil Companies Association, Y91m; Japan Steel Association, Y91m; Sakura Bank,
DKB Bank, Fuji Bank, Mitsubishi Bank, Sumitomo Bk, Long Term Credit Bank,
Y88.9m each; Tokyo Bank, Y88.3m; and Nippon Steel, Y75m. The Sohyo Centre,
of labour unions that support the social democratic party, gave Y100m last
year.
GERMANY
In 1992, Daimler-Benz gave DM1.5m to four parties and Deutsche Bank gave
DM535,000 to the coalition parties. In 1991, North Rhine-Westphalian Metal
Industry Association gave DM625,000 to the coalition parties, and DM75,000
to the SPD. The biggest-ever donor was the former East German government,
which paid DM65m a year to the West German communist party.
FRANCE
The biggest donors tend to be large construction companies, such as
Bouygues, Compagnie Generale des Eaux and Societe Lyonnaise des Eaux.
UK
The biggest contributors to the Conservative party in 1992 were: United
Biscuits (Pounds 130,000), Taylor Woodrow (Pounds 124,500), P &amp; O, and
Hanson (Pounds 100,000 each), Forte (Pounds 80,500). Mr Asil Nadir's Polly
Peck International gave Pounds 440,000 over five years up to March 1990.
Other past donors include: Mr John Latsis, Greek shipping billionaire
(Pounds 2m), Mr Li Ka-Shing, Hong Kong businessman, (Pounds 100,000).
Biggest contributors to Labour party in 1991: Transport and General Workers'
Union Pounds 1.8m, out of overall trade union affiliation fees of Pounds
4.3m.
ITALY
Many large Italian companies are caught up in scandals over illicit party
financing, along with several multinationals (Siemens, GEC Marconi,
Ericsson). Olivetii admits it paid nearly L20bn (Pounds 8.5m) in bribes to
the main political parties, particularly the Christian Democrats and
Socialists, since 1978. Among engineering companies, Saipem paid Dollars
121m in commissions between 1987 and 1992, while Nuovo Pignone paid L25bn.
Fiat admits paying bribes on a range of public works contracts.
CANADA
The ruling Progressive Conservatives raised CDollars 12m from almost 34,800
contributors in 1991. About 55 per cent of the total came from companies and
45 per cent from individuals. Top companies tend to make roughly equal
contributions to the Conservatives and the main opposition party, the
Liberals. Top contributors in 1991 were: Canadian Pacific CDollars 60,884
Conservatives, CDollars 65,000 Liberals; Ernst &amp; Young CDollars 38,674
Conservatives, CDollars 27,127 Liberals; Imasco (42 per cent owned by BAT
Industries), CDollars 48,013 Conservatives, Dollars 47,500 Liberals; RBC
Dominion Securities CDollars 57,098 Conservatives, CDollars 46,872 Liberals;
Royal Bank of Canada CDollars 44,091 Conservatives, CDollars 43,336

FT  26 JUN 93 / Scandals stir voter apathy: Japan's electors seem determined
to throw out the old-style politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE his opponents took to cruising the streets of Tokyo in gaudy
loudspeaker vans this week to rally voters for a metropolitan assembly
election tomorrow, Mr Toshio Terayama adopts a more modest approach. At 25
the Japan New party's youngest candidate, he campaigns on a banner-festooned
bicycle.
After last weekend's political upheaval, the city election will be a pointer
to the outcome of the parliamentary election on July 18. It will test the
strength of the reformist parties including the JNP as well as what remains
of the ruling Liberal Democratic party.
'You don't have to spend so much on election campaigns, and I'm here to
prove it,' says Mr Terayama. He tells his listeners that he will try to
narrow the gap between politics and the electorate.
The move to unravel the old money-driven political system dominated by the
LDP has struck a chord with younger voters, who have been discouraged by the
spate of corruption scandals within the ruling party.
Many voters are showing greater interest in the local polls than in the
past, when turnout has been below 60 per cent.
'I haven't voted since I got married, but I'm interested this time,' says a
housewife in her twenties listening to Mr Terayama, while Mr Hiroaki
Sawazaki, a 30-year-old writer, says: 'It's easy to be cynical, but it's our
generation that has to bring in changes.'
Some local LDP candidates are expected to follow Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former
finance minister, who split from the LDP this week to form his own party.  A
few candidates have covered up the LDP name on their sashes with tape or
concealed the LDP logo on their campaign posters with stickers supporting
political reform.
Meanwhile, many politicians in the provinces have also indicated that they
want to defect from the LDP. Even those who have chosen to remain with the
ruling party have refused campaign support speeches from Mr Kiichi Miyazawa,
the embattled prime minister.
According to a poll of 900 voters published on Thursday by the daily Asahi
Shimbun, 20 per cent said they would vote LDP, down from 25 per cent in
1989, while the JNP came in second with 10 per cent support. The survey  -
conducted on Sunday and Monday before the formation of the two newest
groupings  - indicated that the Social Democratic party, the largest
opposition party, could be hit the most, with a support level of 9 per cent,
down sharply from 17 per cent.
With political reform as the only concrete issue even on the local level,
voters are increasingly confused by the sprouting new parties. Voters say it
is hard to differentiate among them. 'I've voted LDP until now, but I don't
really know who I'll vote for in the local election,' says a middle-aged
housewife who put down her groceries to listen to a campaigner.
Mr Terayama says he is trying to promote social welfare. But his main
message consists of the need for cleaner politics and ousting the LDP.
Whether candidates like Mr Terayama backed by the new reformists can arouse
many among the electorate who have been turned off by the spate of bribery
and tax evasion scandals, remains to be seen.
It will take more than good weather to lure the electorate to the polls.
Some voters, who for a long time have felt their votes would not make a
difference, remain complacent.
'I might vote this Sunday if I have the time. It's hard when you have
children, you know,' says another housewife, as she scurries past the
campaigner.

Japan plans to extend about Dollars 120bn (Pounds 81bn) in foreign aid in
the next five years, almost twice the amount it disbursed in the previous
five years, and making it the world's biggest donor, writes Charles
Leadbeater in Tokyo.
The aid programme is designed to promote private capital investment in
developing countries and undermine foreign criticism of Japan's growing
trade surplus. Japan argues that the surplus does not damage the world
economy because it recycles its export earnings as a capital outflow to the
rest of the world.

SOUTH AFRICA'S right-wing whites, some of whom yesterday drove an armoured
car through the plate glass front of the country's constitutional conference
centre, have long had the arms, the skills and the organisation to disrupt a
peaceful transition to democracy in the new South Africa.
Yesterday saw the first worrying signs that they might also have the
determination to do so.
About 1,000 heavily armed police took little action against the members of
the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement), who
stormed the World Trade Centre outside Johannesburg, beat up black women
delegates and journalists, and defiled the walls of the negotiation chamber
with slogans demanding an Afrikaner homeland and accusing the ruling
National Party of treason.
Terrified delegates fled the centre, leaving about 100 men and women, - all
toting weapons - occupying the chamber where South Africa's first
multi-racial constitution is being written. About 3,000 more waited outside.
Many protestors cited the fact that, on the eve of the assault,
constitutional negotiators had voted by an overwhelming majority to deny the
demand of the right-wing Conservative Party (which represents ultra-radical
whites) for Afrikaner 'self-determination' in a separate white state.
Nonetheless, within hours, the 26-party negotiating forum was back in
business, with the chamber walls repainted to cover right-wing slogans, and
even the Conservative Party (which helped lead the attack) seated at its
accustomed place. Once again, the centre held; but it had another nasty
shock.

THE United Nations world human rights conference ended in Vienna yesterday
evening with the adoption of a grand declaration designed to give a new
impetus to the protection and promotion of international human rights.
The declaration approved by the conference, reaffirmed the principle that
human rights were 'universal, indivisible, and interdependent'. However,
they failed to agree on a controversial call for the appointment of a UN
Human Rights Commissioner to monitor and promote human rights.
As weary delegates from over 160 countries raced to reach a consensus on a
final declaration, debates continued to reflect deep differences of opinion
on what constitutes human rights and the best way to promote them. The
differences were most marked between the developed north and developing
south.
On Thursday, Islamic and African states separately and sucessfully demanded
that the meeting adopt strongly-worded declarations on Bosnia and Angola.
This broke a tacit agreement that specific countries should not be
mentioned.
The moves threw the conference, which opened two weeks ago, into confusion
and delayed proceedings on a final declaration.
The conference also adopted a declaration calling for the immediate sending
of aid to Angola and an end to the country's civil war.
Developing countries were concerned that the appointment of a commissioner
would strengthen what they see as western bias and lead to intrusion in
their domestic affairs. To meet their criticisms the declaration also
recognised the right to development as a basic human right.
But a joint statement from some of the 1,500 non-governmental organisations
at the meeting said the declaration failed to commit governments to measures
to protect and promote human rights.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Warning of terror if Bosnia is split: Ganic urges
international community to reject plan to partition his country

BOSNIAN Vice President Ejup Ganic yesterday warned that Europe would face a
wave of terrorism if it backed a partition of Bosnia.
In an interview in the besieged capital of Sarajevo, Mr Ganic painted a
picture of a Lebanon-style conflict that could result in a campaign of
violence if the international community abandoned a united Bosnia.
Mr Ganic and President Alija Izetbegovic boycotted yesterday's meeting of
the Bosnian collective presidency to discuss the partition proposed by Mr
Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and his Croat counterpart Mr Mate
Boban.
Bosnia's Moslem leaders have rejected the partition because it would
'legitimise ethnic cleansing' and would confine the Moslems to reservations
in economically unviable micro-states.
Mr Ganic predicted the war would last for 10-15 years. He lashed out at
Britain and France, saying Bosnia's Moslems had 'naively' believed they
would win backing from both countries. He said the Moslems, Bosnia's biggest
ethnic group, which has been decimated by the war, were the victims of
Europe's prejudices against Islam.
'I don't want to be responsible for terrorism, but it will happen,
especially in Europe. I don't want to participate in that,' he said.
Mr Izetbegovic is fighting for political survival after a challenge from Mr
Fikret Abdic, the third Moslem representative on Bosnia's 10-member rotating
leadership.
Moslem and other United Nations members have forced a public debate,
probably to be held on Tuesday, on whether to lift the UN arms embargo on
Bosnia and allow air strikes on Serb artillery.
A draft resolution on that approach, also favoured by the US but rejected by
the European Community, was approved on Thursday night for debate. The US
position was unclear, though the resolution was designed to cater to
President Bill Clinton's wish to lift the arms embargo on the Bosnian
Moslems.
Sarajevo radio yesterday reported an upsurge of fighting in Zepce,
Zavidovici and Maglaj, towns north of Sarajevo. It also said there were
renewed clashes west of the capital. In an attempt to stave off the carve-up
of Bosnia, Moslem-led Bosnian forces are trying to gain control of key towns
to link up their enclaves.
In Belgrade, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic cemented his hold over
what remains of Yugoslavia, now comprising Serbia and its tiny ally
Montenegro, when the federal parliament elected Mr Zoran Lilic as president.
'This is the sort of president that Milosevic conceived. Lilic is his
Serbian puppet sitting on top of the two-republic federation,' said a
western diplomat based in Belgrade.
As president, Mr Lilic will also be the supreme commander of the Yugoslav
army, which ensures that Mr Milosevic will have total control over the armed
forces.

<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of shareholders in the Vladimir Tractor Plant, 200km east of
Moscow, met in a football stadium this week to decide who should lead their
newly-privatised company.
The uneven competition, complete with posters, programmes and snacks, indeed
had all the trappings of a football game.
But despite being younger and better trained, Mr Iosif Bakaleinnik, a
Russian graduate of Harvard Business School who controls 12 per cent of the
shareholder votes, failed to take over as chief executive from Mr Anatoly
Grishin, the old-style manager who has run the plant for 18 years.
The 40-year-old challenger's convincing presentation of plans to improve
incentives for workers, and to prepare the company for competition, failed
to sway a majority of shareholders, who voted for the certainty represented
by 60-year-old Mr Grishin.
Pitted against Mr Bakaleinnik were not only fears of what one worker
described as 'more revolutionary changes in our lives' but the vested
interests like those of Tractorexport, the state organisation which exports
the plant's tractors and controls 10 per cent of shareholders' votes through
a proxy.
Powerful propaganda before the meeting included a warning from the regional
administration chief that 'a Harvard education does not train you to tackle
the difficulties of the Russian economy'.
Mr Bakaleinnik, who was the plant's finance director until he went to
Harvard, did manage to secure a seat on the board of directors however and
promised he would be back to fight for the top job.
In the absence of of any experience of capitalism, many workers made their
decision on the basis of parallels with Russian politics. Mr Bakaleinnik
should not be trusted because, like President Boris Yeltsin, he made a lot
of nice promises but would probably not keep them, said Mrs Nadezhda
Baranova.
But Mrs Galina Chernishova displayed the sort of stoic faith in the future
that has helped account for much of Mr Yeltsin's popular support. 'Change is
happening all over the world. Why shouldn't we have it at our company?' she
said. 'Things won't improve for us but at least our children will live
well.'

FT  26 JUN 93 / Yeltsin aides urged to resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S special prosecutor for corruption yesterday stood by his demand
that two of President Boris Yeltsin's closest aides should resign in order
to facilitate an investigation into allegations by Vice-President Alexander
Rutskoi.
Deputy prosecutor general Nikolai Makarov denied that his call on Thursday
for the resignation of Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister,
and Mr Mikhail Poltoranin, the presidential aide who runs the state-owned
media, was politically motivated. But he said the two men could use their
high position to influence the course of the investigation.
Vowing to sue Mr Makarov for slander, Mr Shumeiko said yesterday his
accusations were a 'provocation' designed to help parliament resist Mr
Yeltsin's attempts to push through a new constitution and new parliamentary
elections. The prosecutor general's office has tended to side with
parliament over political reform.
Mr Shumeiko is one of the driving forces behind Mr Yeltsin's Constitutional
Convention, which today reconvenes after a 10-day intermission to resolve
differences in hammering out a draft constitution.
Mr Yeltsin has promised top officials will be equal to ordinary citizens
before the law, but has sometimes given conflicting signals on his
determination to wage 'all-out war' on corruption.

FT  26 JUN 93 / US bank files Dollars 1.5bn BCCI suit

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE global settlement between the liquidators and depositors of the
collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) could be placed
at risk as a result of the a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) law suit against
Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, the leader of Abu Dhabi.
The suit, filed in a US court by First American Bank, secretly and illegally
acquired by BCCI, alleges that Sheikh Zayed, his family and senior former
First American officials such as Mr Clark Clifford, the former US defence
secretary, were guilty of racketeering, conspiracy and fraud.
Mr Clifford was indicted last year in New York on charges of accepting
bribes and lying to US bank regulators.
The suit says the Abu Dhabi ruler and his government were to blame for
financial damage caused by the BCCI affair because he was 'the dominant and
controlling shareholder' of BCCI since 1972.
Specifically, it says Sheikh Zayed and his colleagues were responsible for
reducing First American's sales value by Dollars 500m and caused a loss of
Dollars 1bn of deposits.
In Washington, Mr Caffey Norman, a lawyer for Sheikh Zayed, denied the
allegation and said he was 'outraged' and would contest the charges.
This is the first such legal action against the ruler of Abu Dhabi, whose
government has repeatedly denied any guilt in the BCCI affair. It comes amid
mounting speculation in the US that either federal prosecutors or Mr Robert
Morgenthau, the New York district attorney, may be planning to indict Abu
Dhabi officials.
The suit could have wide-ranging implications because it is a rare US legal
action against a foreign head of state and because it could derail the
planned settlement for BCCI depositors agreed last year by liquidators and
Sheikh Zayed's government.
In Cairo, Dr Adil Elias, chairman of the BCCI depositors committee, said he
supported the legal action and would ask BCCI liquidators to reconsider the
deal they agreed last year with Abu Dhabi in light of the lawsuit.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S Christian Democrats yesterday unanimously rejected an offer to
resign by Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the party leader.
The resignation offer followed the party's poor performance in
administrative elections this month.
Mr Martinazzoli's attempt to stand down from his job, ostensibly in response
to the electoral setback, also reflects his mounting frustration at the
failure of senior party leaders to rally to his calls for reform and a
stream of recent leaks to the press by party members opposed to change.
A special party conference, expected on July 15-17, could be the last chance
to stave off a split between reformists, who are demanding a change of name
and strategy, and those opposed to radical change.
The Christian Democrats have been linked to some of the worst excesses of
the corruption scandals and top party figures who allegedly took kickbacks
have refused to step down.
The party lost control of a number of big Italian cities in the local
elections and saw their support shrink in much of the country, including
parts of the south where they had traditionally been the dominant political
force.
Earlier this year, Mr Mario Segni, one of the most popular politicians in
the country who headed the referendum movement, left in frustration at the
party's inability to promote reform from within.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday hailed Senate passage of a five-year,
Dollars 500bn (Pounds 333.3bn) budget-reducing plan approved by a 50-49 vote
in the early hours of the day.
'We can now move on to a (House-Senate) conference committee with a clear
signal to the financial markets that its interest rates should stay down,'
he said.
'For the first time in a very long time, an American president can go to a
meeting of the G7 nations in a position of economic strength, trying to lead
a renewal of growth and opportunity all over the world.'
Mr Clinton acknowledged that the Senate bill had been changed 'to some
extent' from his own version, but also praised his Democratic colleagues for
having shown 'a remarkable degree of courage'. If the economy fails to pick
up steam, both he and they will have to bear the blame from a constituency
which gives little credit for valour.
Senate and House Democrats, having passed packages which broadly conform to
the president's wishes, will have no time to gloat about victories achieved
without any Republican support. A conference to resolve their differences
could begin as early as next week and tough bargaining lies ahead. A final
vote is expected late next month or early in August.
The close vote in the Senate emphasises the challenge for the budget
negotiators. Six Democrats deserted the president, and Vice President Al
Gore was forced to cast a tie-breaking vote.
Both versions of the bill achieve budget reduction, but the House version
would do more to achieve tax redistribution from the wealthy. The House
agreed to a modified version of the president's proposed broad-based energy
tax, which the Senate rejected in favour of a 4.3 cents-a-gallon fuel tax
(with an exception for jet fuel). The conference is expected to produce
something to broaden the fuels tax.
Both bills raise top corporate tax rates from 34 to 35 per cent and reduce
deductions for business meals and entertainment from 80 to 50 per cent. They
ban deductions for lobbying, club dues and executive pay over Dollars 1m.
Both allow investment tax credits on machinery, although the House was more
generous.
Mr Clinton indicated that he would push for a resurrection of his investment
incentives so states such as California, hit hard by defence cuts, will get
offsetting jobs growth. 'You can't create jobs out of thin air,' he said.
The House voted to restrain the growth of the health care programme for the
elderly by Dollars 50bn over five years. The Senate added another Dollars
10bn to its bill. Both houses agreed to a repeal of luxury taxes on yachts,
aircraft, jewels and furs.
Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, yesterday laid out the
administration's bottom line: Dollars 500bn in deficit reductions,
progressivity and a broad-based energy tax.
The president, who positioned himself above the fray in the Senate, now
seems prepared to take a stronger role in the negotiations. 'If you look at
the level of aggression this country has displayed in trying to do something
about its economic circumstances as compared with what is going on in these
other nations. . . the US should be very proud,' he said.

FT  26 JUN 93 / The EBRD - Attali Resigns: Bank faces uphill fight to define
way forward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, CHRIS BOBINSKI, JUDY DEMPSEY, and NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was set up in 1991 to
guide the recovery of a region stricken by the legacy of totalitarian rule.
Establishing the bank's credentials amid recession in western Europe and
severe economic restructuring in the east was always going to be a difficult
challenge. Had the dispute over Mr Attali's role in the bank's spending
persisted, that task would have become impossible.
The bank's hope must now be that its planned management shake-up and a
return of confidence of its main shareholders will give it the means to get
on with the job.
Both the US and Germany have shown in recent weeks their strong doubts about
Mr Attali's suitability - although neither wanted to call openly for the
president's dismissal.
Even now, however, restoring the bank's sense of purpose will be an uphill
struggle. One seasoned London merchant banker, who knows Mr Attali well and
likes him, said he increasingly believes the decision to set up the EBRD was
a mistake.
Although without experience of managing a bank or even a department of a
public sector institution, Mr Attali was chosen to head the EBRD in view of
the visionary qualities he would bring to the post. In that respect, at
least, he has lived up to expectations.
No European public figure has been more assiduous in calling for a new
spirit of economic co-operation to unite east and west. With passion, he has
warned of the danger that conflict in the former Soviet republics and
Yugoslavia could spill over into the rest of Europe.
Yet, through his own misjudgment, Mr Attali has himself produced the debacle
from which the institution is now trying to escape.
As a result of the bad publicity, doubts over the bank's role already voiced
at its inception have intensified.
Scepticism remains whether the EBRD will be able to find a niche in
assisting eastern Europe, at a time of difficulties for both public sector
development institutions and private sector banks in the region.
The nature of the EBRD's remit itself will be under review as the bank's 56
shareholder nations and agencies get down to the task of choosing Mr
Attali's successor.
In particular, questions are being asked about the balance of the bank's
activities in the 25 countries which it can assist. The proposed appointment
to a senior EBRD position of Mr Ernest Stern, the present number two at the
World Bank, has been widely interpreted as presaging a shift towards public
sector development projects.
Supporting the idea of shifting resources to infrastructure development, one
official in Paris said yesterday: 'The bank's statute that 60 per cent of
its lending should be to the private sector could be interpreted more
flexibly, particularly in the bank's early years. Spending more on public
infrastructure now would help the private sector later.'
The bank's relatively slow rate of disbursements - one of the reasons it has
attracted complaints - has partly reflected its statutory priority towards
financing private sector development.
Since it started at the beginning of 1991, the EBRD has disbursed Ecu244m
(Pounds 192m) in loans and equity.
This is less than 20 per cent of its commitments of Ecu1.5bn, and only about
11 per cent of the total of Ecu2.3bn of projects approved.
Its disbursements thus are only slightly more than the Ecu180m in loans to
eastern Europe paid out by the European Investment Bank, the EC's own
long-term financing institution.
The bank, which has started to lend east of the Community, focuses its funds
on infrastructure projects.
A recent internal report commissioned by Mr Attali, complaining about the
EBRD's lack of impact in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, brought
to a head criticism of the bank's activities.
The report - by Mr Martin Paijmans and Mr Stanley Katz, consultants who have
worked for the EBRD - accused the EBRD of failing to make a 'coherent'
contribution to east European transition.
Of the 95 projects approved by the EBRD since its inception, over 51 per
cent have been in the four most economically advanced countries of Poland,
Hungary and the Czech and Slovak republics.
Greater concentration on infrastructure development, particularly in former
Soviet republics without any experience of private sector entrepreneurial
activity, might thus be a logical move. The risk of such a move, which has
attracted criticism from several of the bank's directors, is that the EBRD
would evolve into little more than the European arm of the World Bank.
In Warsaw yesterday there was some support for the idea that the EBRD should
move into the area until now favoured by the World Bank.
Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, Poland's minister in charge of relations with the
EC, said he would like to see the EBRD more involved in infrastructural
projects such as transport and telecommunications ventures.
'The EBRD should take a lesson from the European Investment Bank,' he said.
Mr Bielecki suggested the EBRD take on the task of guaranteeing loans made
by other lenders in Poland. But he also said the EBRD should lend to and
invest in small private business rather than larger, safer projects.
Ms Hanna Gronkiewicz Waltz, the head of the Polish central bank, signalled
she was happy with the EBRD's emphasis in favour of private industry by
praising the EBRD's activities as being 'in accord with our general
priorities'.
She said the scale of the EBRD's involvement in Poland was larger than
elsewhere and that this was a trend which could only be encouraged in the
future.
Mr Janusz Dedo, in charge of credit policy at the Powszechny Bank Kredytowy,
a major state-owned bank in Warsaw, said: 'We have had good relations with
the EBRD and the main thing is that changes at the top shouldn't be too
abrupt.'
Mr Hubert Janiszewski, the head of Samuel Montagu Financial Services in
Warsaw, warned that ongoing projects might now be changed although he felt
the bank's record had been 'positive'.
In Hungary, Mr Imre Tarafas, an alternate governor of the EBRD and first
deputy president of the National Bank of Hungary, was determined to put the
events of the last few months behind him. He said he hoped the appointment
of a replacement for Mr Attali would end the 'internal tensions and
uncertainty'.

reproach'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jacques Attali's resignation letter to the chairman of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, Mrs Anne Wibble
Dear Mrs Wibble,
It is with regret that I inform you of my intention to resign the presidency
of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. I stated during the
Annual Meeting that the interests of the Bank would always be my highest
priority and would dictate my decision.
I am deeply honored to have served as President of this institution since it
was conceived, at a crucial moment in history, at the initiative of the
Government of France. The Bank's achievements in encouraging democratic
market economies in Eastern Europe speak eloquently of the dedication,
talents and professionalism of its staff. Through their hard work, their
remarkable skills and their international character, the Bank will continue
to play a leading role in the future of the region.
As you know, the Bank has come under increasing negative press attention in
recent months. I know of no action that I have taken that in any way could
be worthy of reproach. Unfortunately this attention has begun to have a
detrimental effect on the Bank's work and on its staff, and it is with the
interests of the Bank in mind that I have taken this decision.
As we agreed during our conversation this morning, it is my intention to
remain in my position until a successor is elected by the Board of Governors
and has taken office.
Yours sincerely,
Jacques Attali
'I UNDERSTAND AND RESPECT HIS DECISION'
Mrs Wibble issued the following statement:
In my capacity as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development, I have today been informed by Jacques
Attali about his intention to resign as President. Considering recent
events, I understand and respect his decision.
I will call a meeting with my Vice Chairman and the President to discuss the
transition and the procedures for the nomination and election of a new
President in accordance with the provision of the Agreement Establishing the
Bank.
Jacques Attali has been instrumental in setting up the European Bank, which
has an important mandate to support the transition to market economy in
Eastern Europe, in particular through the development of the private sector.
I acknowledge that the institution has become fully operational with
remarkable speed under the energetic leadership of Mr Attali. I am convinced
that the achievements of the Bank will be fully recognised once the recent
turbulence has subsided.

FT  26 JUN 93 / The EBRD - Attali Resigns: 'He had the vision. But he was,
well, just a bit arrogant' / The fall of Jacques Attali
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's board room, which is
a quarter of the size of a football pitch, was an appropriate venue for Mr
Jacques Attali's farewell.
The onslaught of criticism faced by Mr Attali in the past three months began
on April 13, when the Financial Times disclosed that the bank had spent
Pounds 200m on itself in its first two years, including Pounds 55.5m fitting
out its City of London headquarters. Of this sum, several millions had been
spent on the boardroom, including its oval designer desk, sophisticated
translation facilities and trompe l'oeil book case.
At 10.30am yesterday, Mr Attali entered the boardroom and told the bank's 23
directors, who represent the 56 countries and agencies which own the bank,
that he had decided to resign. 'The attacks have been growing day by day,'
he said. 'It is better for the institution that I take this decision.'
Most of the directors received the news in silence. Many were relieved,
concerned at the tide of bad publicity and convinced that new management is
required. But of the three who did speak out, all offered praise. 'Thank you
for what you have done for the bank,' Mr Guiseppe Maresca, the Italian
director, told the meeting. 'This board will take care of your baby.'
Mr Maresca was paraphrasing Mr Attali, who at the annual meeting at the end
of April had referred to the bank as his 'baby'. It was partly as a result
of his initiative that the EBRD had been set up in April 1991.
His original vision was that the EBRD should be a publicly- owned
institution which assessed its investments as rigorously as a blue chip
investment bank, while being explicitly motivated by the political goal of
promoting democracy and free markets in the fledgling private sector of the
former Soviet bloc.
It was a vision unique and complex as the man himself. Mr Attali had never
worked as a banker, although he wrote a biography of Sir Siegmund Warburg,
the founder of SG Warburg. But he chose to ignore one of his subject's main
strictures, that banks should never spend lavishly on their offices.
At the age of 49, friends say he still thinks of himself as an
anti-establishment figure, having been born into an Algerian Jewish family.
However, he was educated at France's elite National School of Public
Administration, his brother, Bernard, is chairman of Air France, and he
spent most of the 1980s as the special adviser to the French president, Mr
Francois Mitterrand.
His intellectual and physical appetite is legendary. He has published 16
books and starts work before dawn each day, although this has not prevented
him becoming an habitue of London nightspots.
But perhaps his most salient characteristic is his capacity to arouse
passions in others. 'People either love him or hate him,' said a close
colleague. 'You won't find many who are indifferent.' To some, he is
Renaissance man, to others a dilettante. There is evidence for both views.
On the one hand, he has probably been the west's most articulate analyst of
the problems faced by the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. On the
other, he has been accused - though he vehemently denies it - of plagiarism
in his new 960 page book, Verbatim, which records Mr Mitterrand's life at
the Elysee Palace from 1981 to 1986.
Perhaps inevitably, the EBRD's staff has been split between those, mostly
francophones, close to Mr Attali, and a group which felt itself outside the
charmed circle. 'There was a bank within a bank,' said one executive. 'In
terms of who wielded power, titles were less important than being a friend
of Mr Attali.'
This inner group included Mr Pierre Pissaloux, who originally held the roles
of both cabinet director and budget director, but who has since relinquished
his budget role, Mr Francois Olive, Mr Attali's personal assistant, Mr Guy
de Sellier, the deputy head of merchant banking and Mr Andre Newburg, the
general counsel.
Like many French statesmen, notably Mr Mitterrand, Mr Attali believes that
public buildings should be monuments. It would have been unthinkable for him
to scrimp on the bank's headquarters.
But the bank's US, UK and Australian employees and directors judged the
building's fitting out costs extravagant, notably the decision to replace
one type of brand new marble with another at a cost of more than Pounds
750,000. They were also angry at Mr Attali's use of private jets. In 1992,
the bank paid Pounds 739,000 for him to make 26 journeys by private aircraft
supplied by a Paris-based charterer, Air Entreprise. Some of the
destinations were well served by scheduled flights.
The bank's audit committee is now investigating whether proper procedures
were followed on the building and why Mr Attali used the private flights, as
well as examining other allegations of extravagance and loose financial
controls. A deadline of July 15 has been set for the report to go to the
EBRD's board.
However, the board's preoccupation in the past few weeks has been whether
the bank should change its philosophy of concentrating on making investments
in the private sector to devote more resources to developing the
infrastructure of eastern Europe.
This issue had become confused with the question of who should manage the
bank, since Mr Attali had presented a management reorganisation proposal
whose effect would have been to concentrate more resources on development
banking, or investing in infrastructure.
Level-headed debate within the bank on this issue became difficult, since Mr
Attali's plan was viewed by some as an attempt to reinforce his own
position. 'We were discussing personalities, rather than the issues,' said a
director.
The reorganisation also had the effect of demoting Mr Ron Freeman, the first
vice president and head of merchant banking, from number two to number four
in the bank. This plan, which is still under consideration by the board,
would have involved the appointment of Mr Ernest Stern, currently number two
at the World Bank, to the new post of EBRD chief operating officer and the
promotion of Mr Mario Sarcinelli, currently in charge of development banking
at the EBRD, to take charge of the budget and personnel.
The result was open warfare between Mr Attali's supporters and his
opponents. Mr Freeman, having in April written an article in the FT
defending the EBRD's expenditure on refurbishing its offices, felt betrayed.
'Morale here is terrible,' said one executive yesterday. 'The personnel
department has been inundated with resignation notices.'
The final external blow was a story in yesterday's FT that Mr Attali had
double-billed his expenses on a trip to Tokyo. Mr Attali wrote in his
resignation letter that he knew of 'no action that  .. in any way could be
worthy of reproach,' but he felt he had to go.
The obituaries, like the earlier reviews, will contain wildly varying views.
As one senior east European diplomat put it yesterday: 'He had the vision.
But he was, well, just a bit arrogant with us. I hope his successor is as
committed to integrating the two Europes.'

FT  26 JUN 93 / Government to back early start for N-plant: Further public
consultation likely over Thorp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will throw its support behind British Nuclear Fuels'
controversial Thorp reprocessing plant on Monday. It is also expected,
however, to announce a further round of public consultation, which might
delay a final decision for months.
The Pounds 2.8bn plant at Sellafield in Cumbria, which environmental
pressure groups call Britain's biggest white elephant, is waiting for a
licence from the Department of the Environment to begin operation. The
government will call for the Commons to support 'the commissioning of the
plant at the earliest practicable date', its most forthright endorsement in
the year-long debate over Thorp's future.
The wording is contained in a draft amendment to be offered by the
Department of Trade and Industry, BNF's shareholder, to a motion from the
Liberal Democrat leader attacking Thorp. Monday's motion from Mr Paddy
Ashdown says: 'There are increasingly strong economic, environmental and
(nuclear) proliferation reasons why it would not be in the interests of
Britain or the rest of the world for the government to bring Thorp into
operation.'
The DoE's expected second round of public consultation follows advice from
the attorney-general that it needs to consider the wider diplomatic,
economic and environmental issues raised by the plant if it is to avoid the
risk of judicial review.
Environmentalists last night accused the government of pre-empting the DoE
licensing decision with the amendment. Greenpeace, the pressure group, said:
'If the government does not call a full public inquiry, we will see them in
court, and press for a judicial review.'
The draft amendment includes the words 'subject to receipt by BNF of such
consents as are required by law', which appears to leave the way open for a
public consultation or inquiry.
Swiss and German customers of Thorp wrote to Mr John Gummer, environment
secretary, this week, to express their concern at the delay in starting up
the plant, which was originally planned for January this year. The DoE is
also expected to announce on Monday the publication of the long-awaited
report by the government's Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee,
which predicts that large amounts of nuclear waste from Thorp's foreign
customers will remain at Sellafield permanently.
BNF has agreed to keep much of the bulky low and medium-level waste produced
by reprocessing foreign customers' nuclear fuel, and to send them back a
smaller volume of highly radioactive waste.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Attali quits as EBRD chief 'in bank's interest': Press
criticism over finances blamed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Attali yesterday said he will resign as president of the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the aid bank he was instrumental in
creating two years ago.
He will remain in place until a successor is elected by the board of
governors.
His decision follows months of criticism of the bank's financial controls,
including the disclosure in the Financial Times yesterday that Mr Attali had
been reimbursed twice for a first-class return flight to Tokyo in May 1992
and that he had been paid Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 20,000) for making a speech
in Japan.
Over the past three months, the bank has been criticised for its slowness in
making investments in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union  - which it
was set up to do  - and also for the Pounds 55.5m it has spent on furnishing
its offices and additional sums spent on the use of private jets and other
overheads.
A bank executive said Mr Attali made up his mind to quit early yesterday
morning. He telephoned Mrs Anne Wibble, the Swedish finance minister and
chairman of the EBRD's finance directors, to tell her his decision.
In a letter to Mrs Wibble he said: 'The bank has come under increasing
negative press attention in recent months. I know of no action that I have
taken that in any way could be worthy of reproach.' The letter continues
that this 'attention' has begun to damage the bank and that 'it is with the
interests of the bank in mind that I have taken this decision'.
In a statement released after Mr Attali's resignation, Mrs Wibble said:
'Considering recent events, I understand and respect his decision . . . I
acknowledge that the institution has become fully operational with
remarkable speed under the energetic leadership of Mr Attali.'
Mr Attali called an impromptu meeting of the bank's 23 directors, who
represent the 56 countries and agencies which own the bank, to say he would
be leaving.
'The announcement was greeted with relief from most of us,' said a director.
'Morale here has hit bottom.' However, the directors representing France,
Belgium and Italy thanked Mr Attali for his contribution.
Directors immediately began discussing in informal meetings how fast a
replacement should be found and whether to go ahead with Mr Attali's planned
management reorganisation.
Three people were mentioned by directors as possible successors to Mr
Attali: Mr Onno Ruding, the former Dutch finance minister, currently working
for the US bank Citicorp, who came close to being appointed head of the EBRD
before it was set up; Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the former president of the German
Bundesbank; and Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the governor of the Banque de
France.
A director said there was an understanding between the governments of the G7
group of leading industrial countries, who control 54 per cent of the EBRD's
shares, that the president should be a European, although not necessarily
from a European Community member country.
In France, reaction to the resignation of Mr Attali, who was adviser to the
French president, Mr Francois Mitterrand, from 1981 to 1991, was mixed.
Mr Roland Dumas, a former foreign minister and close associate of President
Mitterrand, said 'the Anglo-Saxon establishment' had brought Mr Attali down.
Officials in the conservative Balladur government reiterated France's
attachment to the bank, but said it was open to changes.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Major tries to restore calm in Tory ranks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major sought yesterday to calm the political storm over the
Conservative party's links with Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman, by
insisting that the resignation of Mr Michael Mates had drawn a line under
the affair.
The prime minister's comments came as senior ministers rallied to support
his authority. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, dismissed the
prospect of any challenge to Mr Major's leadership as a 'dead duck'.
Mr Hurd admitted yesterday the government had had a rough year, with 'a run
of misfortunes and certainly mistakes', but said that Mr Major's authority
was not in doubt.
He believed the government was at a turning point, where the underlying
realities of economic recovery and increasing party unity would come
through.
There was foreboding, however, among Tory MPs that the furore over the
fugitive businessman might be revived in a resignation statement by Mr
Mates, who is expected to attack the handling of Mr Nadir's case.
The government was also confronted by the threat of a backlash from Tory MPs
over taxation. Several MPs on the right of the party reacted angrily to the
suggestion from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that he might raise taxes
in the November Budget. The MPs called instead for much deeper cuts in
public spending to reduce the borrowing requirement.
Mr Major appeared shaken by the barrage of media criticism of his handling
of Mr Mates' resignation on Thursday, with aides describing him as 'furious'
at the coverage.
His frustration at the persistent questioning of his authority was also
apparent in his own comments yesterday. 'Prime ministers are there to be
criticised. Whatever had happened, I think I would have been criticised.
That is the way of life for prime ministers,' he said in his Huntingdon
constituency.
Calling for an end to the concentration on the Mates affair, Mr Major said:
'It's over, it's finished,' and appealed for the former minister to be left
alone for a while. Sir John Wheeler, a veteran backbencher, is to succeed Mr
Mates as Northern Ireland security minister.

FT  26 JUN 93 / Vendome offers a place for luxury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RAREFIED world of European luxury goods caught the scent of a new name
yesterday with the christening of Vendome, the planned holding company for
the portfolio of luxury brands owned by Richemont of Switzerland.
Cartier, Piaget, Mont Blanc, Dunhill and Karl Lagerfeld will be injected
into Vendome, which is to be listed in London and Luxembourg if a
restructuring of Richemont's subsidiaries is approved by shareholders.
Analysts estimated the new company could be valued at up to Pounds 3bn,
making it a member of the FT-SE 100 index in London, even though luxury
brands are out of favour because of recession.
Richemont, controlled by the Rupert family of South Africa, yesterday spelt
out its plan to simplify its complex group structure by splitting off the
tobacco arm, Rothmans International, and combining the two luxury goods
businesses, Luxco and Dunhill Holdings, into Vendome. Dunhill is at present
a 57 per cent owned subsidiary of Rothmans.
Shareholders in Rothmans and Dunhill Holdings are being offered cash and
shares in the new tobacco and luxury goods companies. Richemont said the new
structure would lead to savings and improved marketing. 'We are trying to
get the operational structure to reflect operational necessities,' said Mr
Johann Rupert, managing director.
The restructuring will also bring to an end Dunhill Holdings' life as a
publicly listed company. The company, which was set up by Alfred Dunhill
exactly 100 years ago, was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1923.
Lord Douro, Dunhill's chairman, said Vendome's individual brands would
continue to be managed separately and the disappearance of Dunhill's listing
was not significant.
'We believe Vendome is one of the most distinguished group of brand names.
It would be immodest to say more than that,' he said.
The new company is named after Paris's upmarket Place Vendome. Mr Robert
Hocq, the entrepreneur who reunited the divided house in the 1970s, also
used a company named Vendome Holdings, which later became Cartier Monde.
Richemont has controlled Cartier since 1984.

FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Eurotunnel may need to seek a further
Pounds 1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROTUNNEL may need to raise additional funds 'of under or around Pounds
1bn' to pay for the Channel tunnel with an equity issue a possibility in the
first half of next year, shareholders were told yesterday.
It had not been expected that the company would consider making a share
issue so close to opening of the tunnel.
The figure of Pounds 1bn was also marginally higher than some analysts had
expected, although the group insisted that its funding expectations had not
changed and that any numbers at this stage were only an estimate.
The group has previously raised Pounds 8.9bn, of which Pounds 1.6bn is
equity.
Mr Graham Corbett, chief financial officer, told the annual meeting in
London that Eurotunnel's current facilities were likely to last 'to around
the middle of 1994 plus or minus a couple of months.'
He said that banks in discussions with Eurotunnel had agreed that the
opportunity should be seized if conditions in the first half of next year
were 'suitable for an early equity raising by way of a rights issue or
similar route.'
It had been accepted that it would be preferable if future funding involved
a '50:50 split between equity or equity type funding and additional debt.'
Any equity issue would be timed to be at or near the opening of the tunnel
for services. Contractors building in the tunnel have told Eurotunnel that
the project was unlikely to open before next summer unless an agreement
could be reached over their claims for additional payments.
Eurotunnel's bankers, which so far have agreed to lend the project Pounds
7.3bn, however, are working on the basis that a phased opening would take
place with the first services for heavy goods vehicles starting in February
and services for cars and coaches starting in April next year.
Mr Corbett said that the loss of potential revenue caused by delays, rather
than any further increase in construction costs, was causing the strain on
future funding needs. The cost of building the project, including lost
revenue since 1987, has risen from Pounds 4.8bn to approaching Pounds 10bn.
He estimated that additional finance required by the group 'should be under
or around Pounds 1bn of which more or less Pounds 600m will be needed during
1994 and 1995 with the balance to be in place by the beginning of 1996.'
Up to Pounds 200m of this might come from a free issue of warrants, on the
basis of one warrant for every share held.
These would allow shareholders to buy one new share for FFr28.25 or 335p for
every ten warrants acquired. These could be exercised in October 1995 or in
June next year if funds were required earlier.
Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's chief executive, told shareholders that it
would cost the group 15 times more if it accepted the contractors demands
than the revenue it would lose through late opening.

<TEXT>
Turnover in international trading group Lonhro jumped to 8.2m as the shares
moved ahead 7 1/2 to 121p after the reported interim figures which were at
the top end of market expectations.
Dealers were particularly relieved that the dividend had been maintained,
while the optimistic accompanying statement also boosted sentiment.
Analysts, however, remain cautious about the group's future on fundamentals
and one said: 'A rights issue cannot be ruled out in the near future if the
company's recovery is to continue.'
In aerospace and engineering, British Aerospace gave up 9 to 399p amid
funding fears for its deal with Taiwan Aerospace. TI Group rose 4 to 340p
after saying it was in talks with Snecma, of France, over a merger of its
Dowty subsidiary with Messier-Bugatti, Snecma's landing gear business.
One market watcher said: 'This is the right thing to do and TI has realised
Dowty cannot stand alone in this business.'

FT  25 JUN 93 / Genentech files new suit against Eli Lilly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
GENENTECH, the US biotechnology company, said it had filed a suit against
Eli Lilly, the pharmaceuticals company, charging that Lilly's manufacture of
a human growth hormone, used to treat dwarfism, infringes a new Genentech
patent.
The move came after Genentech had been granted a patent covering basic
processes used in recombinant DNA technology or 'cloning'.
Genentech, a pioneer in the use of recombinant DNA technology to produce
pharmaceuticals, launched its first product, a human growth hormone, in
1985. Lilly entered the market two years later with its own version of human
growth hormone.
Since then, the two companies have been waging legal battles over patent
rights.
Eli Lilly said: 'This is yet another suit in the ongoing litigation.'
Genentech said its new patent resulted from early biotechnology research
conducted by Dr Keiichi Itakura and Dr Arthur Riggs at the City of Hope
National Medical Centre.
'Their research led to the production of the first useful protein by
recombinant DNA technology, which is widely acknowledged as one of the most
significant scientific achievements of this century,' said Mr Stephen Rains,
Genentech vice-president of intellectual property.
Genentech has already licensed its recombinant DNA technology, including
that covered by the new patent, to 28 other companies in the biotechnology
field.
In 1990, Roche Holdings acquired a 60 per cent stake in Genentech for
Dollars 2.1bn.
Separately, the Food and Drug Administration is set to review Genentech's
application for approval of Pulmozyme, a treatment for cystic fibrosis.
Analysts predicted that the drug may be approved before the end of the year.

FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: Goldman calls lawsuit frivolous
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GOLDMAN, Sachs, the New York investment bank, yesterday accused a US
subsidiary of Prudential, the UK insurance group, of an attempted 'hold-up'
in filing a lawsuit this week against Goldman.
The suit, filed on behalf of Prudential-owned Jackson National Life, accused
Goldman of 'fraudulent conveyance' in the 1988 leveraged buy-out of
Bucyrus-Erie, a manufacturer of mining equipment, which was organised by
Goldman. It seeks unspecified damages.
Jackson brought Dollars 60m of bonds in Bucyrus, which recently failed to
meet bond interest payments, through a private placement in 1990.
Its suit is the latest of several seeking to portray 1980s buy-outs which
have gone sour as fraudulent deceptions of investors. Such suits have not
had great success in court.
Goldman yesterday dismissed the lawsuit as a 'frivolous complaint without
any merit'.
It said Jackson National was a Dollars 16bn, sophisticated insurer which,
following its own due diligence review, had made a private placement
investment in Bucyrus 'more than two years after the original leveraged
buy-out was completed'.
It added that Bucyrus had been operating in a depressed industry in a
difficult economy.
'Jackson National and their investment advisor, PPM America, are apparently
upset and are trying to hold someone up because their investment in
Bucyrus-Erie hasn't fared well,' said Goldman.
PPM also claims the terms of the LBO 'placed the Goldman group in control of
(the company) so that they could realise all the benefits of operating BE
while BE's unsecured creditors assumed all of the financial risks associated
with such operations.'

FT  25 JUN 93 / Profits fall at atomic energy body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority yesterday announced a 30 per cent
fall in operating profits as it awaits a government decision on whether it
will be privatised.
Mr John Maltby, the departing chairman, said the government would have to
pay for decommissioning the historic nuclear research installations if it
wanted to sell off the group. 'It is difficult to privatise anything with
unquantified liabilities, particularly in the decommissioning area', he
said.
AEA said that it had a 'letter of understanding' from the Department of
Trade and Industry that it would meet the bill.
The same dilemma about how to split off past nuclear liabilities upset
electricity privatisation three years ago. The authority, which now trades
as AEA Technology, shows decommissioning liabilities of Pounds 14.3m in its
balance sheet.
Mr Brian Eyre, chief executive, said there were other activities which 'you
could say don't really belong' if the group were sold. He cited the
500-strong police force AEA employs for security at sites now run by British
Nuclear Fuels.
Recession and a drop in government nuclear work cut group turnover in the
year to March 1993 from Pounds 425m to Pounds 415m, and cut operating
profits from Pounds 33m to Pounds 23m.
Half the Pounds 61.6m of exceptional costs was due to redundancy, AEA said.
Staff numbers fell in the year from 9,187 to 8,022. The group plans a
further 500 redundancies this year.
Infrastructure renewal - upgrading decades-old electricity and air
conditioning systems - also accounted for Pounds 34.2m of the exceptional
costs. Mr Brian Eyre, chief executive, rejected suggestions that AEA was
clearing its books ahead of privatisation.
Sir Anthony Cleaver, the former chairman of IBM UK, will take over the
chairmanship on July 4.

<TEXT>
THE Indian government yesterday gave the go-ahead for direct foreign
investment proposals worth Rs6.17bn (Pounds 129.5m).
The decision opens the way for eight big foreign companies to enter newly
liberalised Indian markets.
These include Coca Cola and Pepsico, the US soft drinks giants, Peugeot, the
French car manufacturer, finance companies GE Capital and Morgan Stanley,
Nippon Denro, the Japanese steel manufacturer, and the Scotch whisky maker
Seagram and United Distillers, the spirits arm of Guinness.
Coca Cola will return to India 15 years after it was evicted by the Janata
government of 1977. Coca Cola South Asia will promote a new wholly-owned
venture in India, with a capital of Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.3m). The proposal
projects exports over the first seven years, with export earnings expected
to exceed the import cost of raw material, and has offered to reinvest the
dividends in India for that period.
The cabinet committee on foreign investment has also allowed Pepsico to
raise its equity to 51 per cent and become the main shareholder of Pepsi
foods, which was allowed into India in 1989 with strict export commitments.
The food processing giant will now raise its subscribed and paid-up equity
from Rs800m to Rs1.05bn.
Peugeot of France will establish a joint venture with Indian car maker
Premier Automobiles to produce 60,000 cars a year, introducing the Peugeot
309 and 205 models to India. Peugeot will invest Rs1.20bn in the project,
which has export obligations.
While the GE Capital proposal seeks to establish a wholly-owned subsidiary
in India, with an investment of Dollars 75m to Dollars 100m over the next
three to four years, Morgan Stanley proposes an assets management company in
the mutual funds and funds management industry, inviting direct foreign
investment from foreign institutional investors.
Nippon Denro Ispat, the Indian joint venture with the Japanese steel
manufacturer, will build an integrated steel plant, with an investment of
Rs900m.
The government has set aside its earlier reservations about allowing foreign
spirits manufacturers in.

FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: BNP warns of sharp fall in
results for first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANQUE Nationale de Paris (BNP), one of France's largest banks and a key
target for privatisation by the new French government, yesterday warned of a
substantial fall in net profits for the first half of the year.
The bank, which recently reported a 26 per cent reduction in net profits, to
FFr2.17bn (Dollars 380m), last year, said its commercial banking business
was performing well. However, it said it would have to make hefty provisions
on its exposure to small businesses in France and to sovereign loans.
As a result, BNP anticipates a sharp slide in net profits for the first half
of the year, to between FFr500m and FFr550m, against FFr1.33bn in the same
period of 1992. Unless the economic situation improves, it expects the same
trend to continue in the second half of this year.
Despite the profits warning, BNP is still committed to privatisation. The
bank, originally scheduled for sale to the private sector in the mid-1980s
by the last centre-right French government, is expected to be one of the
first issues in the new privatisation drive.
Mr Michel Pebereau, who chaired Credit Commercial de France during its
privatisation in 1987, last month replaced veteran Mr Rene Thomas as
chairman of BNP with a brief to prepare the bank for sale.
BNP's problems in the first half are reflected across French banking, which
has been hit by the impact of the recession on demand for credit, and on the
small business sector. BNP will also suffer in 1993 because of further
provisions on sovereign loans; last year it was able to claw back FFr1.7bn
in surplus provisions.
Despite these pressures, BNP estimates net banking income will rise 6 per
cent during the first half, mainly due to growth from foreign activities. It
also expects a 10 per cent increase in gross operating profits.
BNP is continuing its cost-cutting initiatives under Mr Pebereau. It
recently launched a long-term plan to improve productivity by pruning
staffing levels. The move has already triggered protests from employees.
The group is also pursuing its international expansion. Until recently it
was more cautious about investing outside France than other Gallic banks,
notably Credit Lyonnais, the other state-controlled commercial banking
group.
However BNP has negotiated a cross-shareholding agreement with Germany's
Dresdner Bank, whereby the two groups will take stakes of at least 10 per
cent in each other to cement their existing partnership agreement.
Credit Commercial de France (CCF), the French bank that Mr Pebereau left to
head BNP, yesterday disclosed plans to acquire Banque de Savoie, the
regional bank, in a share deal.
CCF already owns 24.26 per cent of Banque de Savoie and is offering nine of
its own shares for 10 of the remaining shares.

<TEXT>
BfG BANK, the German bank which is majority-owned by Credit Lyonnais of
France, predicted yesterday that it would break even for the year after
making provisions for bad and doubtful corporate and sovereign lending.
This would be the first time in years that the bank would be able to achieve
such a result, having been burdened since the late 1980s by high provisions
against eastern bloc loans, by exposure to problem company loans and more
recently by the costs of rationalisation, according to Mr Paul Wieandt,
chief executive.
As previously reported, total losses last year amounted to a net DM1.15bn
(Dollars 679m), while operating profits were DM187m after DM144m in the
previous year.
Mr Wieandt said that total profits for the first half of the current year
had risen by 11 per cent against the comparable period last year.
He said he hoped the positive trend would continue in the rest of the year
and was confident of controlling bad debts despite the deterioration in the
economic climate.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australian government has reduced its 1992-93 budget deficit estimate
from ADollars 15.9bn (USDollars 10.8bn) to ADollars 15bn because of a higher
than expected collection of company tax and an underspending on
infrastructure works, writes Emilia Tagaza in Melbourne.
Australian company profits rose 24 per cent during the March 1993 quarter to
a near-record ADollars 4.89bn. The increase was due mainly to the shrinking
burden of interest costs.
But Mr John Dawkins, federal treasurer, said the improved outcome would not
affect the ADollars 18bn starting deficit expected in 1993-94.
The government has begun looking for savings in next year's budget. Bruce
Jacques adds from Sydney: Mr Allan Hawkins, former chief of the collapsed
Equiticorp investment group, has been charged by the Australian Securities
Commission (ASC) with breaches of corporate law.
Mr Hawkins is serving a six-year term in Auckland after being jailed in
February this year by the High Court of New Zealand on fraud and conspiracy
charges. The sentence includes a non-parole period of three years.
Equiticorp, founded by Mr Hawkins in 1984, collapsed in 1989 with debts
estimated at almost Dollars A4bn.

<TEXT>
UNCERTAINTY over the future of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP)
has prompted the country's leading banks to reconsider loans to the party.
The LDP asked the banks for Y20bn (Dollars 187m) in low-interest loans, but
the banks are likely to scale down the amount to Y15bn following the split
in the party earlier this week. Until now, the LDP's ability to maintain
stable rule over the country had served as a 'collateral' for bank loans.
Meanwhile, Japanese business groups, which have traditionally backed the
LDP, expressed the need for a more flexible approach.
Although Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the most powerful
group of business leaders federation of economic organisations, which
donates an annual Y13bn to the LDP, has pledged its continued LDP support,
leaders of the Keizai Doyukai, the Japan association of corporate
executives, and the Nikkeiren - the Japanese federation of employers'
associations - said political donations should be made on the basis of party
plat-forms.
The construction industry, known for its strong ties with LDP politicians,
is also reviewing rules for political donations. A study group for the
association of leading contractors is considering prohibiting donations to
individual politicians.

DENMARK'S parliament yesterday passed by one vote a reform designed to boost
economic growth and give highly taxed Danes income tax breaks over the next
five years, Reuter reports from Copenhagen.
The legislation was passed by 65 votes to 64 with 50 members of the 179-seat
parliament absent. The Social Democrat-led four-party government has a
one-seat majority.
The cutting of Denmark's exceptionally high marginal tax rates will be
financed by new green taxes on petrol, electricity, certain categories of
motor vehicles, heat and water consumption.
The reform also broadens the income tax base by eliminating or reducing
deductions, most notably for homeowners and increasing social security
contributions by taxpayers.
The top rate of income tax will come down to around 60 per cent from just
below 70 per cent, with the lowest rate down to around 40 per cent from just
above 50 per cent.
But the measures, to be implemented over five years from January 1, 1994,
will reduce only slightly the total Danish tax burden, which is among the
highest in the world.
Opinion polls are showing plummeting support for the government, ind-icating
that Danes are sceptical about whether they will be better off.
Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, who came to power in January, proposed
the measures after years of failed attempts by successive centre-right
minority governments to mobilise support for reforming the tax system.
The opposition Conservative and Liberal parties voted against the package
after a month of parliamentary negotiations failed to reach an all-party
consensus, arguing it imposed a heavy new tax burden on industry.
The government calculates this at DKr3bn (Dollars 460m) by 1998, but the
Federation of Danish Industries estimates the burden at just under DKr8bn.

FT  25 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Tour firms hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The impending inquiry by the Office of Fair Trading into the links between
the three largest UK tour operators and the country's biggest travel agents
sent tour company shares on a downward journey.
The move, which was announced after the market closed on Wednesday, led to a
fall of 15 to 324p for Airtours, and left Owners Abroad 4 cheaper at 97p
after 1.2m shares traded.
Analysts greeted the OFT's investigation with a mixture of dismay and
puzzlement. 'In a sector in which there is already a lot of uncertainty,
this will lead to short-term dullness,' said one, who recognised that 'the
OFT is not at all happy about the industry'.
Another wondered what punch the OFT could actually pack and suggested that
the practice under scrutiny - vertical integration - was the natural way
forward for the travel business. 'I am not convinced that consumer choice is
under threat at the moment,' he said.
Airtours last night was rumoured to be interested in acquiring another
package holiday company - the Cardiff-based Aspro.
Close Brothers, the merchant bank, eased 2 more to 342p after it was
revealed that Refuge Group, the life assurance company, had sold a block of
800,000 shares, 1.82 per cent of the issued capital, reducing its holding to
2.46m shares, or 5.6 per cent. The shares were sold on Wednesday when an
agency cross was transacted in the market at 331p, well below the then
ruling price.
TSB dipped 3 1/2 to 194p on hefty turnover of 9.4m shares, the biggest since
the end of April, following marginal disappointment with the preliminary
results.
The bumper profits - well in excess of the most optimistic forecasts - from
Smith New Court, the highly rated UK securities house, triggered a 35 jump
in Smith shares to a record 285p. The market took Smith's Pounds 41.2m
rights issue at 210p a share in its stride.
Farnell Electronics forged ahead 13 1/2 to an all-time peak of 417 1/2 p
after the chairman said at the annual meeting that sales in the company's
first quarter, from February 1, were up 10 per cent, and that since then
they were up around 15 per cent. Electronics analysts said they were
confident that the news would trigger earnings upgrades of 10 per cent in
the near term.
The pharmaceutical issues continued on their downward path, still affected
by the current round of profits downgrades, which began last week with US
analysts chopping their earnings estimates. Glaxo dipped 6 more to 573p on
turnover of 3.2m shares, with London analysts following their US brethren in
lowering their earnings projections.
Courtaulds was one of the few stocks in the chemicals sector to make
progress, with a number of institutions said to be switching out of ICI and
into the former. Courtaulds shares jumped 13 to 565p, albeit on
unspectacular turnover of 729,000 shares.
The sparring between Boots and Kingfisher saw the former winning points
after Strauss Turnbull recommended switching to it from Kingfisher. Boots
moved ahead 7 1/2 to 444 1/2 p with 1.5m traded while Kingfisher fell 9 to
604p.
Further recognition for good results pushed up Courts, the furnishing group,
15 to 628p.
Optimism over John Menzies' results - due on July 12 - moved up the share
price 6 to 497p.
Profit-taking was said to be behind a decline of 3 by Forte to 223p in
buoyant volume of 6.9m. 'It comes after a very strong performance,' said one
leisure analyst.
Pict Petroleum was the pick of the smaller oil stocks, the shares climbing
rapidly to close a net 7 higher at 122p, their highest level since December
1990, following highly encouraging drilling news. Pict said it had made a
potentially commercial gas find in its 47/2-1 discovery well in the North
Sea.
After the previous day's flurry in the breweries group, Greenalls Group took
another tumble following comment on its bid for JA Devenish. In spite of a
buy note from Nikko it gave up 3 to close at 355p. Devenish held at 367p,
while Boddington, a key part of the takeover moves through its stake in
Devenish, shed 3 to 283p.
Allied-Lyons managed to escape virtually unscathed after an announcement of
job cuts warnings over tough competition in the industry from Mr Don
Marshall, managing director of Carlsberg-Tetley - the joint venture between
Allied-Lyons and Tetley. Allied closed a fraction off at 539 1/2 p.
The rally of Kwik Save continued with a move up of 11 to 739p, while Geest
rallied to outperform the market with an increase of 11 to 350p.
The psychological effect of paying up time in a cash-call weary sector was
blamed for a generally poor performance in property and the particular slide
of British Land, which announced a successful take-up of its recent rights
issue. The rights was 95.96 per cent taken up, with the remainder placed
yesterday morning, but the shares retreated 4 to 319p.

FT  25 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI down in heavy trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SERIES of sell recom-mendations from leading UK and US broking houses,
accompanied by profits downgrades, prompted another drop in ICI shares,
which ended 18 lower at 663p, after 655p. Turnover was 10m shares, the
biggest single day's business since the end of February.
The stock has come under consistent selling pressure since the middle of
this month, retreating from just over the 700p mark. That was the highest
point since the all-time peak of 806p reached just before the great crash of
October 1987.
ICI shares were very popular among big US institutions following the Zeneca
demerger, advancing from 636p when the demerger became official and peaking
at 706p.
Rumours of profits downgrades in ICI have been circulating since the middle
of the month when there was talk that estimates were being lowered to Pounds
200m to Pounds 230m from previous levels of around Pounds 300m. These
rumours have now become factual.
A number of brokers are said to have been in contact with ICI recently and
to have adjusted their forecasts. In the US, PaineWebber reduced 1993
earnings per share estimates from Dollars 1.50 to Dollars 1.40. In the UK,
Kleinwort Benson Securities added ICI to its 'sell' list, describing the
stock as 'too expensive' and saying estimates are too high.
NatWest Securities issued a 'sell' note yesterday, adopting the view that
'signs from the chemicals industry are now pointing to cyclical recovery
being delayed. Although we believe ICI could generate earnings per share of
80p by 1997, this does not make the long term price/earnings ratio exciting,
nor does it suggest much more for dividend growth'.

FT  25 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-taking trims recent share
gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CURRENCY uncertainties cast a shadow over the UK stock market yesterday,
leaving the FT-SE 100 Index to drift below the 2,900 mark in modest
profit-taking. The improvement in the US dollar brought little response from
the blue chip internationals, while domestic consumer issues were left
confused by the withdrawal of the German finance minister from the planned
Franco-German financial discussions.
UK equities opened lower as a good start in stock index futures failed to
counterbalance overnight weakness in New York. The loss of the Footsie 2,900
mark was not unexpected in the market since several leading securities firms
were known to be ready to take profits above that level.
Selling pressure was not heavy, but with the September future contract on
the Footsie at a smaller premium than earlier this week, the underlying
Footsie-listed stocks weakened and the market was soon down by 12.8 points.
Traders reported little sign of buying at the lower levels, suggesting that
investors might have been restrained yesterday by the resignation of a UK
government member.
Equities steadied but turned indecisive again while dealers watched the
screens for further details of the apparent row in Germany ahead of the
Franco-German financial talks. Hopes that the French delegation would press
for co-ordinated interest rate cuts were dashed when the Germans pulled out
of today's meeting in Paris.
London rallied towards the close when Wall Street made a braver start to the
new session, gaining 9.13 Dow points in UK trading hours. The final reading
showed the FT-SE 100 at 2,894.7 for a decline on the day of 6 points.
Seaq volume fell to 517.2m shares from Wednesday's 603.3m, with non-Footsie
business making up about 59 per cent of the total - an average proportion
for recent sessions. On Wednesday, retail business was worth Pounds 1.33bn,
maintaining the healthy daily averages of the past nine months.
Traders were not unduly dismayed to see the 2,900 level lost in a market
still keenly awaiting convincing evidence from the corporate sector that the
economic recession is lifting. Profits statements yesterday from Lonrho, the
international trading group, and from TSB, the UK bank, did nothing to
change perceptions of the outlook for equities.
At Kleinwort Benson Securities, Mr Trevor Laugharne commented that the stock
market looked unlikely to hold above 2,900, but said the firm was lifting
its forecast for the short term trading range to 2,800 to 3,000. 'We are
somewhat more optimistic about the market than we have been in recent
weeks,' he added.
The heavyweight end of the market was again held down by US selling of the
pharmaceutical stocks, although losses were fairly modest yesterday.
Shares in ICI weakened as market analysts turned their attention to a group
now firmly focused on chemicals following the successful demerger of the bio
science and pharmaceuticals interests into Zeneca; a few pence were shed by
Zeneca but the market remained well pleased with the outcome of the demerger
rights issue.
Uncertainty over the outlook for Wall Street also lay heavily across the
leading oil shares and prompted some profit-taking in Reuters, the
electronic global financial news network.

FT  25 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK index futures traded in a tight range with no economic features to
assist dealing, writes Joel Kibazo.
The opening in the September contract on the FT-SE 100 was subdued, coming
in at 2,906, down 10 points from Wednesday's close. A firm gilts sector and
a steady performance from the European markets brought a slow advance in the
contract, and by 10am it was trading at the day's high of 2,921. It moved
back and forth over the next few hours of trading mainly in the 2,905 to
2,915 range.
Fears of a poor opening from Wall Street led to selling activity which
pushed the September future to a day's low of 2,903. It recovered with the
firm opening in New York.
September ended at 2,913, off 3 points from Wednesday's close and 8 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of 11 points. Volume remained
poor at 6,248 lots.
Good turnover among the stock options continued to be the main feature in
traded options, bringing total volume to 27,231 contracts. Hanson was
particularly active and registered the biggest turnover at 2,810, with most
of the day's business resulting from the August 220 puts. It was followed by
Dixon's at 1,703 contracts and BP at 1,574. Lonrho, which reported figures
yesterday, and Zeneca were also actively dealt. Just over 2,600 contracts
were traded in the FT-SE 100 option and 4,565 in the Euro FT-SE option.

FT  25 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Futures related buying helps
Dow to advance
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER TWO days of losses, equities turned higher yesterday, helped by a
round of futures-related programme buying, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 23.80 at 3,490.61. The
Stan-dard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 3.43 ahead at 446.62, while the Nasdaq
composite gained 3.93 at 688.72. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled
267.4m shares and rises outnumbered declines by 1,124 to 764.
The stock market, which had been depressed by Wednesday's bearish economic
data, shrugged off the morning's report that initial jobless claims for the
week ended June 19 had risen 8,000. Most analysts had expected claims to
fall by about 1,000.
Shares in Goodyear Tire, the last of the big US-owned tyre companies, moved
forward Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 40 3/4 in active trading on the back of
encouraging second-quarter net earnings predictions of Dollars 130m to
Dollars 140m, compared with Dollars 106.9m a year earlier. In the last year,
the stock has traded in a range of Dollars 27 7/8 to Dollars 41 3/4 .
A number of pharmaceutical issues were actively traded. Glaxo Holdings eased
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 16 1/2 , Johnson &amp; Johnson firmed Dollars  5/8 to
Dollars 41 5/8 , Merck put on Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 36 3/8 and
Schering-Plough rose Dollars 2 1/4 to a 52-week high of Dollars 70 1/2 .
USX-US Steel Group tumbled Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 41 1/8 after the company
filed for an offering of 9m common shares.
Athletic shoe maker Nike eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 54 1/8 , a 52-week
low. The stock took a battering earlier this week after the company issued a
profits warning.
Motorola gained Dollars 1 at Dollars 83 5/8 after the company's advertising
supplement in the Wall Street Journal raised hopes that its new PowerPC
chips would pose a threat to other semiconductor manufacturers.
In the Nasdaq market, Digital Microwave plunged Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 8
1/2 on warnings of a possible first-quarter deficit. Merrill Lynch cut its
investment rating on the stock to short-term neutral from above average.
Sun Microsystems advanced Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 28 5/8 after the company
said it plans to repurchase about 9.5 per cent of its common stock in a
buy-back funded from available working capital.
Shares in two semiconductor companies, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel,
lost ground after the stocks were downgraded by a PaineWebber analyst.
Advanced Micro fell initially but recovered to finish unchanged at Dollars
21 1/8 , but Intel lost Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 53 3/4 .
Canada
TORONTO remained on its recent upward path in continued heavy trading, the
TSE 300 index ending 27.9 stronger at a high for the year of 3,979.6.
Advancing issues outpaced declines by 437 to 301 after a volume of 79.9m
shares valued at CDollars 919m.
Among the sub-groups, 11 of the 14 were higher. The gold shares index again
recorded the day's biggest change, rising 2.53 per cent. The banking sector
was up 1.22 per cent.
Rampart Mercantile, which added 26 cents at CDollars 2.86, posted a
six-month net profit from continuing operations against a year-ago loss.

FT  25 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Interest rate cuts come into
prospect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST rate cuts came into prospect again in most bourses, and happened in
Copenhagen. In Frankfurt, however, depression seemed to be setting in on
this score, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS climbed on rate cut hopes and foreign buying, even although today's
meeting between French and German monetary authorities was postponed. The
CAC 40 index rose 20.89, or 1.1 per cent to 1,963.30, turnover holding at a
high FFr4bn.
But it was not all plain sailing for interest rate sensitive stocks. In
banks, BNP certificates fell FFr14 to FFr513 as it forecast a slump in first
half profits for 1993 and blamed provisions against both sovereign, and
small business loans.
Other news was better, Alcatel Alsthom gaining FFr11 at FFr667 as it
confirmed that it expected to maintain profits this year. Peugeot extended
its gains after Wednesday's agm, rising FFr10 to FFr559.
The strength of the dollar, meanwhile, lifted Lafarge and Saint Gobain, up
FFr14.50 to FFr388 and FFr6.40 to FFr499.90 respectively. But Canal Plus
continued to fall, losing another FFr21 to FFr1.250, this time after rumours
that it will lose the privilege of broadcasting films only 12 months old.
FRANKFURT fell on the poor state of German economy and on receding rate cut
hopes, the DAX index closing 13.10 lower at 1,686.29 as turnover declined
from DM7.7bn to DM6.9bn.
Banks fell in unison, Deutsche Bank losing DM10.80 to DM676.20. However, the
weakness of the D-Mark now extends back to mid-April, and banks have been
relatively poor performers over that period. The most interest
rate-sensitive, Bayernhypo and Bayernverein, dropped DM5 to DM393.50 and
DM9.50 to DM415, down by 8.1 and 9.9 per cent respectively since last March
31.
There were still one or two winners. Lufthansa climbed DM3 to DM113 after a
large foreign order. In a mixed automotive section, Volkswagen rose DM5.30
to DM356.30.
MILAN lost ground, disappointed at the failure of unions, employers and
government to produce any deal on labour costs. The Comit index shed 2.77 to
534.63, but selling pressure was light as the the market began to
concentrate on the prospects for a further cut in Italian interest rates.
Olivetti put in a strong performance, rising L85 or 6.5 per cent to fix at
L1,385 on news that its L903bn rights issue had been fully taken up by
investors. It was also boosted by hopes that it will be successful in its
bid to manage cellular telephone operations once the state
telecommumications sector is opened up.
RAS, the insurer, dipped L200 to L27,313, its 73 per cent fall in profits
proving in line with market expectations. BCI was L62 easier at L4,882
although it said that first half profits were much better than those for the
same 1992 period.
ZURICH's consolidation proved short lived, the market returning to a record
high after Wedneday's dip. The SMI index finished 13.2 ahead at 2,336.1.
Early hopes for lower rates were reinforced by reports that France and
Germany would meet on Friday to discuss co-ordinated interest rate cuts, but
the meeting was postponed. Nevertheless, banks were beneficiaries of the
focus on rates. UBS bearers, which topped the active list, rose SFr22 to
SFr1,072.
Bearer shares in Baer Holding firmed SFr35 to SFr1,315 after the bank said
that its consolidated profit in the first half of 1993 would equal the
profit for the whole of 1992.
AMSTERDAM was mixed, disappointed that there would be no concerted
Franco-German move on interest rates, but still supported by the strength of
the dollar. The CBS Tendency index eased 0.2 to 110.7.
The publishing sector was in demand. VNU added 60 cents to Fl 113.60 on news
that it has taken a 38 per cent stake in a Dutch commercial television
station. Elsevier gained Fl 1.00 to Fl 136.20.
Chemicals issues were mixed, DSM losing Fl 1.00 to Fl 89.60 after news that
it will curtail its plastics and hydrocarbons production. But Akzo added 50
cents to Fl 151.00 on plans to double production capacity at two of its
Dutch fibre producing plants.
COPENHAGEN shook off its recent lethargy as the central bank cut its 14-day
repo rate by 15 basis points to 7.95 per cent. The KFX index closed 0.88
higher at 88.94.
Danisco rose DKr24 to SKr735, while Moeller's D/S 1912 A and B rose DKr1,412
and DKr2,000 respectively DKr108,000 and DKr107,500.
ISTANBUL took its series of consecutive all-time highs to its sixth in
succession and the eleventh this month, the market index rising 195.4, or
1.7 per cent to 11,607.5.
TEL AVIV dropped for the fourth consecutive session, mutual funds acting for
the general public selling while provident and pension funds were the
dominant buyers as the Mishtanim blue chip shares index lost 2.07 to 196.20
in turnover of Shk210m.

gain on Soros tale

<TEXT>
ANOTHER strong day for the futures market prompted technical buying, and the
Nikkei average gained ground on support by public funds and dealers, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei was finally up 192.55 at 19,685.07, after opening at the day's
low of 19,501.46 and hitting a high of 19,729.65 in the afternoon. Volume
remained almost flat, at 250m shares against 244m.
Advances led declines by 868 to 179, with 107 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks rose for the third consecutive day,
climbing 21.69 to 1,584.08. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 4.42 at
1,205.70.
The bond market closed higher thanks to the stronger yen, prompting renewed
hopes of monetary easing by the Bank of Japan. The dollar closed Y1.97 down
at Y108.60, while the yield on the No 145 10-year benchmark bond fell 3.5
basis points to 4.425 per cent.
Traders said public fund support limited the downside for the Nikkei, but
that the unexpected weakness in the economic recovery had limited the
prospects of a rise above the 20,000 level.
Mr Takatoshi Okuyama at Daiwa Securities expects the index to move between
19,300 and 20,000 in the near term. 'Market participants still cannot
evaluate the implications of the political upheaval,' he added.
Mining issues were popular on rumours that Mr George Soros was once again
buying the gold market. Sumitomo Metal Mining was the most active issue of
the day, forging ahead Y57 to Y1,030, while Mitsui Mining and Smelting rose
Y18 to Y515.
The higher yen supported electric power utilities, which gained 2.74 per
cent on the day. Tokyo Electric Power put on Y50 at Y3,550. High-technology
exporters were lower.
Short-covering helped steel issues. Nippon Steel moved up Y6 to Y366 and
Sumitomo Metal Y8 to Y330. Uniden, a mobile phone maker, appreciated Y140 to
Y3,090 on reports that it had received approval for its mobile phones from
the Chinese government.
Hosiden, a consumer electronics parts maker, rose Y70 to Y2,040 as investors
were encouraged by the US decision to lift the anti-dumping duty on Japanese
high performance liquid crystal displays.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 249.56 firmer at 21,773.03 in volume of
26.6m shares.
Roundup
THE REGION mostly turned easier. Hong Kong and Taiwan were closed for public
holidays.
AUSTRALIA was marginally higher as stronger bullion prices drove golds,
taking the sector index up 45.1 to 1,775.0. The All Ordinaries index edged
0.9 ahead to 1,699.7 in heavy turnover of ADollars 412.1m.
Placer Pacific appreciated 21 cents to ADollars 2.76. News Corpor-ation
moved forward 9 cents to ADollars 7.54 on expectations of strong profits
figures for the current financial year.
SINGAPORE suffered a wave of selling in nervous afternoon dealings after
Wednesday's rebound, and the Straits Times Industrial index fell 20.21, or
1.1 per cent, to 1,770.90. The nervous tone was attributed to reports of
heightened tension on the Iran-Iraq border.
BANGKOK was also depressed by reports of heightened tension in the Gulf and
the SET index weakened 16.25, or 1.8 per cent, to 894.08.
Bangkok Bank of Commerce shed Bt2.25 to Bt22.50 and NTS Steel lost Bt2 to
Bt53 after the exchange authorities said that trades in the two issues must
be settled in cash, instead of the normal policy of half cash and half
credit, following recent 'irregular movements'.
SEOUL saw continued profit-taking in blue chip manufacturers and financial
issues but the market was carried higher by some healthy demand for small
and medium-capitalisation shares. The composite index added 0.42 at 762.95.
BOMBAY began firmly but the advance was reversed after midsession on rumours
that allies of Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao's government were planning to
withdraw support. The BSE index closed 6.51 down at 2,228.55.
KUALA LUMPUR extended its downward correction and the composite index
dropped 16.30, or 2.3 per cent, to 701.66, the mood still soured by news
that the authorities were investigating alleged trading irregularities.

FT  25 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Foreign ownership talk brings Jakarta
to life - This year's surge in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Indonesian stock market tends to catch pundits unawares. After an
almighty crash in 1991, the market was all but written off as a backwater of
poor earnings growth, low turnover and ceaseless scandal.
But like one of the archipelago's many volcanoes, equities have bubbled back
into life. Since the new year the Jakarta composite index has risen by 31
per cent to yesterday's 1993 high of 358.39. While this is still far below
its 1990 peak of 682, local and foreign investors alike are rediscovering
their appetite for stocks.
Much of the recent gain has been prompted by government officials suggesting
that the limit on foreign ownership - currently set at 49 per cent of
companies' listed shares - will be raised, probably to 60 to 80 per cent. In
the belief that foreign fund managers will grab at the opportunity to
increase their Indonesian exposure, local investors have been buying stock.
In the last month, daily turnover has consistently exceeded Rp50bn,
considerably better than the Rp20bn (Dollars 9.6m) or less averaged in
quieter periods. The top dealing houses may now be turning a profit for the
first time in a year, allowing formerly disgruntled brokers to wear their
Mont Blanc pens with pride.
How long the bullish smiles will remain is an open question. Many brokers
fear that local interest will wane once the foreign ownership limit is
raised, only returning on the back of a fresh and spicy rumour. Others argue
that the arrival of new foreign money will push the index up, attracting
more locals into the game.
Mr Peter Arkell, Indonesia specialist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London,
says the point is close where the internal dynamics of the market will tie
investors in place. Indonesian investors will 'start watching the market and
spreading rumours like Malaysia and Hong Kong', he adds.
A bullish outlook is also supported by evidence that the fundamentals of the
Indonesian economy are improving. Whilst the bad debts of the banking system
are disturbingly high, interest rates are coming down, and inflation, after
an initial spurt at the start of the year, appears to be under control.
Foreign donors are expected to pledge about Dollars 5bn to Indonesia for the
next year when they meet in Paris on Monday.
There is a danger, however, that bad news is being glossed over, a concern
heightened by the lack of bearish brokers in town. Economists warn of a
falling off of private direct investment and call into question the
government's policy of subsidising state-owned high-technology industries.
On the corporate scene, many companies remain highly geared and 1992 results
were generally poor, with Astra International, the automotive conglomerate
and the market's second largest company, a typical example.
While the purchase of a stake this week by Toyota, of Japan, has lifted its
ownership crisis, Astra remains burdened by poor sales and more than Dollars
800m in foreign debt. Yet its share price has appreciated by 55 per cent in
the last six months.
An indication of the strength of investor sentiment will be the response to
a forthcoming tranche of new issues, including Barito Pacific, a leading
timber company headed by the politically well connected Mr Prajogo Pangestu.
Barito Pacific is expected to raise Dollars 300m, equal to the total that
was raised by all 16 new issues last year, and valuing the business at
Dollars 3bn.
It may be that Indonesia is coming into form at the right time, given the
stagnant performance of the scandal-ridden Thai market and the political
turmoil in Japan. As Mr Anthony Davies, managing director of Baring
Securities Indonesia, explains, American unit trusts are currently awash
with cash and looking to invest. 'Unit trust subscriptions are at record
levels, and if their managers put just a tiny bit into Indonesia the market
will go up,' he says.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Widespread falls in D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SANDEEP DEOL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK slipped against virtually all the major currencies yesterday and
set a new post-war low against the yen, writes Sandeep Deol.
It closed in London at Y63.79, compared to Y64.50 on Wednesday. Against the
dollar it weakened to DM1.7115 from DM1.6935, but it finished New York
trading at DM1.7073.
The D-Mark's decline began with a call from Mr Edmond Alphandery, French
economy minister, for a meeting with German government ministers to discuss
'co-ordinated monetary policy easings'.
Mr Alphandery said: 'The Germans must speed up their rate cuts.' The news
had knocked the D-Mark to DM1.71 per dollar by mid-morning.
The German Finance Ministry later denied that the two countries were
discussing co-ordinated rate reductions, but pressure on the D-Mark
intensified.
There were strong rumours of Bundesbank action to buy D-Marks via German
commercial banks to prop up the currency. However, any such defence action
was hardly helped by reports from Japan that other Group of Seven nations
would step up calls for cuts in German borrowing rates at next month's Tokyo
summit. The increased pressure for a cut in German rates raised expectations
that the German central bank might ease monetary policy at its council
meeting next Thursday, although the fall in the currency may limit the
Bundesbank's room to manoeuvre.
Mr Keith Edmonds, international economist at NatWest Securities, believes
the Bundesbank will not be forced into an early easing. As a result, the
D-Mark may move up slightly before dipping again.
The D-Mark's loss of favour has been reflected in the rise of the French
franc. In spite of French interest rates being lower than German official
rates, the franc firmed early yesterday against the D-Mark before slipping
later on profit-taking. It ended unchanged at FFr3.363 per D-Mark.
Sterling rallied against the weaker D-Mark, finishing at DM2.5125, up 2
pfennigs from the previous close. Against the dollar it ended at Dollars
1.4685, after Dollars 1.4725 on Wednesday. The pound's performance is being
harmed by political tensions. Yesterday's resignation of another UK
government minister was viewed by many traders as further eroding the
government's credibility.
However, assuming the political tension subsides, sterling could recover
quickly. Many dealers report that continental European institutions are
waiting to buy pounds when the political mood has settled.
This is considered the more likely on the grounds that growth prospects this
year for the UK economy are thought to be relatively good, compared with the
gloomy outlook for much of the developed world.
Elsewhere in Europe, the reduction of European interest rates continued as
the Danish central bank cut its two-week repo rate by 15 basis points to
7.95 per cent.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Money Markets: Cheaper money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FALLS IN interest rates in Denmark and Italy yesterday widened the pattern
of easier borrowing conditions across Europe, Peter Marsh writes.
The reductions underlined the gradual downtrend irrespective of any action
by the Bundesbank.
While pessimism about the outlook for the German economy has moderated
slightly, many investors see easier monetary conditions across the Continent
as inevitable in the light of the European recession.
The Danish central bank said it offered to enter two-week repurchase
agreements at a fixed yield of 7.95 per cent, down from 8.10 per cent in the
previous two-week offer. But it left its discount and deposit rates
unchanged at 7.75 per cent.
In Milan, the minimum rate at the Bank of Italy's lira repo fell 40 basis
points to 9.50 per cent, possibly foreshadowing cuts in official interest
rates.
Ms Marianne Jelved, the Danish economy minister, said Danish short and
long-term interest rates were likely to fall to below German levels over the
next six months. The Bundesbank's key discount rate stands at 7.25 per cent,
although it could come down at its council meeting on Thursday.
Three-month interbank rates in the Netherlands, France, Belgium and Ireland
were all last night comfortably below the equivalent figure in Germany of
7.44 per cent. While Dutch interbank rates were 88 basis points below the
German level, corresponding figures for the other three nations were 56, 70
and 75 basis points respectively.
In Frankfurt, Mr Otmar Issing, a Bundesbank board member, said a one basis
point cut this week in the central bank's repo rate to 7.59 per cent did not
prejudice future policy decisions.
In Amsterdam, dealers said the Dutch central bank would stick to its policy
of protecting the D-Mark/guilder parity in spite of a string of recent
independent rate cuts, led by the French central bank. Call money edged up
to 7 per cent from 6.93 per cent.
On UK money markets, the Bank of England injected Pounds 962m into the
banking system after a forecast shortage of Pounds 950m. While UK
speculation on imminent cuts in base rates has cooled, many believe the
government is likely to sanction easier borrowing conditions over the next
few months to boost the recovery.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Quotas on CIS 'could hit
aluminium prices'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM PRICES could go down if the European Commission imposes quotas on
imports to Europe from the Commonwealth of Independent States, according to
Intercomalum, the organisation recently set up to promote and defend the CIS
aluminium industry.
CIS producers would be forced to look for new markets and might have to
offer additional discounts to tempt new customers. This would have a
knock-on impact on worldwide aluminium prices, Intercomalum suggests.
This is one of the points the organisation will make in written
presentations to the commission, scheduled to be delivered on Tuesday.
The commission is being urged by European producers to impose draconian
quotas on the former Soviet Union's aluminium imports and is inquiring into
their complaints under rules that allow measures to 'safeguard' European
Community industries. Its decision is expected very soon.
Details of the CIS industry's strenuous plea against quotas were finalised
at an Intercomalum meeting in St Petersburg this week.
Intercomalum will also point out that any drop in the CIS's income would
make it even more difficult for the aluminium industry to carry out
environmentally-necessary work at its smelters. There would, moreover, be
less money for downstream joint ventures with western groups for such things
as aluminium can production plants, which would absorb more CIS metal
domestically.
Mr Elliott Spitz, a vice chairman of Intercomalum and also a director of the
New York-based AIOC Corporation, said that Intercomalum would shortly set up
an office in London. He said the UK capital was chosen to emphasise that the
office would provide 'a conduit for investment in the CIS by way of joint
ventures' and not just for political lobbying.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Agriculture Department has succumbed to pressure from Capitol Hill
and farm lobbyists to direct some of its export subsidies for wheat into
Mexico, where Canadian wheat has made large inroads into the market.
An offer to Mexico for 1,400 tonnes of subsidised US wheat was included in
an announcement of a 32m tonne multi-country package of subsidised offers
for the 1983-84 marketing year. In the past, the US has used export
subsidies almost exclusively to challenge the European Community.
The National Association of Wheat Growers praised the Clinton Administration
for combating 'blatantly unfair trading practices', which are alleged to
include Canada's subsidised rail rates and prices subsidised by the Canadian
Wheat Board.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Banana sales crisis forces
Ecuador to reduce producer prices by 9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLLITT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   QUITO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN RESPONSE to a growing sales crisis and international price slump,
Ecuador, the world's largest banana exporter, has cut the price of its
bananas. The government-regulated price that exporters pay producers is down
by 40 US cents a box, or nearly 9 per cent, from last month.
Sales in the first four months of this year were down 31 per cent from the
same period last year. About 17 per cent of the fall was caused by
diminished sales volume (649,000 tonnes this year), while a decrease in
price accounted for the rest.
With prices having been driven lower by oversupply on the world market, and
with the European Community import restrictions likely to cut sales further,
Ecuador's price cut is an attempt to boost its competitiveness.
Announcing the price cut, Mr Mariano Gonzalez, the minister of agriculture,
said it was 'intended to aid our exporters and signal to consumers that we
are serious about remaining competitive'. He added: 'We hope the measure
will mitigate our sales crisis somewhat in the second half of the year.'
The productivity of Ecuador's banana plantations compares unfavourably with
that of its competitors. While growers in Honduras produce 2,800 boxes a
hectare and those in Costa Rica 3,000 boxes, Ecuador's manage to average
only 1,400 boxes a hectare. But lower overall costs have so far enabled
Ecuadorian bananas to be more competitive internationally.
The Union of Banana Growers and Exporters, an organisation representing
producers from Central America and Columbia, blames Ecuador, which has
increased its planted area by at least 30 per cent since 1991, for the
current oversupply.
The EC restrictions are certain to reduce Ecuador's sales volume further and
analysts estimate that the country faces a potential loss of Dollars 70m.
Mr Jose Riofrio, head of promotion and marketing for bananas in the ministry
of agriculture, says that at least 20,000 hectares of banana plantations
will have to be destroyed or phased out to compensate for the sales loss
resulting from EC import restrictions. He adds, however, that only the least
productive fields will be eliminated. Mr Riofrio does not expect the price
of bananas to fall much further. 'The price in European markets is
stabilising,' he says, 'while floods on plantation and strikes by industry
workers in Central America and Columbia are curbing supply in the
short-term.'
Ecuador will not face the full force of the crisis until late this year when
the country's banana harvest reaches its peak and new crop supplies will
flood the market.
Meanwhile, street vendors in Quito and Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest cities,
have begun to sell export quality bananas, usually earmarked for the US or
Europe, at bargain prices.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Buying flurry lifts gold price

<TEXT>
GOLD'S PRICE jumped by Dollars 5.80 a troy ounce to close at Dollars 373.80
in London yesterday. The sudden change followed some days when the price had
drifted gently downwards. But trading was dull and one dealer described
yesterday's volatility as 'a blip in a quiet market where professional moves
are exaggerated'.
New York professional investors started the flurry on Tuesday. Having failed
to drive the gold price down below Dollars 366 an ounce, they changed
tactics and had much more success pushing it the other way. The market was
quiet overnight because of a holiday in Hong Kong but the London market
reflected the New York activity. Gold touched Dollars 375.20 an ounce at one
stage before falling back.
Trade in physical gold was slow. 'Demand is falling away, particularly in
the Far East and producers are doing no hedging,' said Mr Andy Smith,
analyst with Union Bank of Switzerland.
He pointed out that, since the gold price sprang to life in April, imports
of the precious metal to Dubai had dropped by about 25 per cent from the
monthly average in the first quarter, those to Singapore were 30 per cent
down and those to Taiwan were down 50 per cent. Only in Hong Kong, where
jewellers were stocking up because China was easing its currency export
regulations, had there been a rise in gold imports in April.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Divisions remain over tropical
timber pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS-sponsored talks on a new tropical timber pact are due to end
today with little progress on key issues, despite initial optimism. A third
round of negotiations on a successor to the 1983 International Tropical
Timber Agreement, which expires next March, is likely in two or three
months' time.
Consuming and producing countries are still split over the scope of a new
agreement. Consumers are resisting producer calls to include temperate and
boreal timber in the pact. Producers complain that tropical timber is
discriminated against in international trade because it has to satisfy
stricter environmental criteria. Tropical timber has been losing market
share to temperate timber in recent years, in part because of environmental
concerns.
At the beginning of the week-long talks, consumers put forward a
three-pronged compromise plan that would keep temperate timber out of the
agreement but commit consumer nations to aim at sustainable forest
management for traded temperate wood. The plan also included language in the
new agreement to bar trade discrimination against tropical timber as such
and more finance for projects of benefit to producer nations.
Producers then said they wanted consumer nations to take on environmental
commitments 'as clear and unambiguous' as those in the proposed tropical
timber agreement. If consumers have their way, the new accord will require
all traded tropical timber to come from sustainably managed forests by the
year 2000, a target already set by the International Tropical Timber
Organisation.
Although consumers have refined their proposals over the week, conference
sources said yesterday that they remained unacceptable to producers.

NICKEL crashed to seven-month lows on the LME as speculative liquidation and
investment fund sales were triggered below Dollars 5,540 a tonne for
three-month metal. Expectations that stocks will rise again soon also
weighed on the market. Three-month metal closed at Dollars 5,420 a tonne,
down Dollars 162.50. Three-month ALUMINIUM broke higher, extending a
technical move above Dollars 1,200 a tonne, and ending near new 3 1/2 -month
highs. Dealers said the market continued to benefit from a constructive
chart picture, but the rise was in danger of becoming top-heavy, and
resistance was likely around current levels. On the fundamental side no
fresh factors emerged, although there was persistent talk of some
approaching development, such as a smelter closure. COPPER trading was
largely routine, with the market settled comfortably into a range and paying
little heed to talk of sizeable stock movements. The current TIN downtrend
shows little sign of abating. Three-month metal fell to a new 20-year low of
Dollars 5,005 a tonne, and the Dollars 5,000 level now looks vulnerable.
London COCOA suffered a moderate downward correction following the recent
climb to a three-month peak.

<TEXT>
STATOIL, THE Norwegian state oil company, announced yesterday that it would
proceed with plans to build a NKr3bn (Pounds 285m) methanol plant, despite a
NKr600m cost escalation.
In April, Statoil warned that the costs, originally put at NKr2.4bn,
threatened to rise by several hundred million kroner, prompting a
comprehensive review of the plan. Statoil 82 per cent of the project and
partners Conoco Norway and parent company du Pont du Nemours 18 per cent.
The plant is to be supplied, from the fourth quarter of 1996, with 650m cu m
of gas annually from the Heidrun oil and gas field. It will produce 830,000
tonnes of methanol a year.
'The decision to continue the methanol project has been based on an overall
assessment of both solutions for Heidrun gas (reinjection of the gas into
the field's reservoir or supplying it to the methanol plant),' Statoil said.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Anglo set to challenge for top
spot in copper league - The South African group's expansion plans, focused
mainly on South America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLO AMERICAN Corporation of South Africa, best known for its gold and
diamond operations, is laying the groundwork for a huge copper business in
South America that will place its subsidiary in the region among the world's
leading producers.
The group also has the right of first refusal when Zambia privatises its
copper business, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, scheduled to go ahead by
1998.
If all goes to plan, Anglo would jump from about fifth place among the
world's leading copper producers possibly to challenge Codelco in Chile,
which currently leads the field with annual output of more than 1m tonnes.
Anglo has been focusing attention primarily on its South American projects
in presentations to analysts and institutions in South Africa and Europe.
The group's interests in the region are held by Anglo American Corporation
of South America (Amsa), a 50 per cent-owned mining, finance and industrial
company that Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, Anglo's chairman, describes as 'a
mini-Anglo in South America'. He says that the stock market floatation of
Amsa is a possibility when its development projects are more advanced.
In Chile, Amsa's most important interest is a 75 per cent stake in Mantos
Blancos, which is already producing about 78,000 tonnes of copper a year.
Mr Ogilvie Thompson says that Mantos Blancos is embarking on four projects
in Chile and Peru which will cost USDollars 442m:
Some Dollars 85m will go to expand open pit copper output at Santa Barbara
in Chile from 30,000 tonnes a year to between 35,000 and 40,000 tonnes. A
feasibility study will be completed shortly. Another Dollars 56m may be
spent on installing a modern solvent extraction-electro winning processing
plant at Santa Barbara;
A second feasibility study is close to completion for the Mantoverde copper
project in Chile, which is expected to produce 37,000 tonnes of open pit
copper a year and cost Dollars 150m;
Mantos Blancos recently paid Dollars 12m for the Quellaveco copper deposit
in southern Peru, in which about 24m tonnes of copper has been identified.
There is to be a Dollars 2.5m, three-year feasibility study;
Mantos Blancos and Anglo's subsidiary Minorco also recently bought between
them one third of the Collahuasi copper project in Chile from Chevron for
Dollars 190m. Mr Dave Deuchar, Anglo's chief metallurgist, says Collahuasi
will become 'one of the world's great copper mines'. Production is likely to
start in 1988 and reach about 300,000 tonnes a year.
The Royal Dutch/Shell group owns another third of Collahuasi but is at
present considering an offer for most of its metals and mining assets from
Gencor of South Africa. Mantos Blancos, Minorco and the other partner,
Falconbridge of Canada, have pre-emptive rights to Collahuasi and Mr Deuchar
says Mantos Blancos will certainly pre-empt 'if the price is right'.
In Brazil, Amsa's interests are held largely in association with the Bozano
Simonsen group through Mineracao Morro Velho which has mines that last year
produced about 12 tonnes of gold. Morro Velho recently won a tussle with RTZ
Corporation of the UK for a stake in a world-class copper deposit at Salobo
in the Carajas region of the Amazon, owned by Companhia Vale do Rio Doce,
Brazil's biggest state-controlled mining group.
The project is expected to cost Dollars 750m. Morro Velho and CVRD hope to
develop a mine producing 150.000 tonnes a year of copper and 8,000 tonnes of
gold. A feasibility study should be completed in one year and it would take
another three years for mining to begin.
The Salobo deposit was discovered in 1976. Since then CVRD has spent Dollars
120m on it. The company has already established that the ore body consists
of at least 700m tonnes, containing 0.7 per cent copper and 0.5 grams of
gold a tonne, with more ore to be discovered. Development has been held back
because of its unusual ore. It has to be ground into a very fine powder
because the copper is disseminated through it.
Meanwhile, Mr Ogilvie Thompson says that Anglo has 'first refusal rights' on
the Zambian government's 60 per cent stake in ZCCM. 'We are getting on well
with the new management and would buy the government interest on the right
terms and conditions,' he adds. Anglo already owns 27.3 per cent of the
Zambian copper producer. The rest of the shares are in public hands.
ZCCM has also been talking to analysts in London and says it needs Dollars
2bn over the next 15 years to keep production from falling any further. Mr
Larry Hanschar, ZCCM's consultant metallurgist, says, however, that a big
chunk is needed almost immediately.
He says ZCCM is ready to go ahead with financing for the Dollars 600m
Konkola deep mine project where it has an estimated 344m tonnes of ore
containing a juicy 3.8 per cent copper. ZCCM hopes to produce about 150,000
tonnes of copper in concentrate for about 50 years from Konkola.
In its last financial year, to March, the company produced 432,000 tonnes of
copper and 4,706 tonnes of cobalt. To put that in perspective, in the heady
days of 1969, ZCCM produced 689,254 tonnes of copper.
Mr Hanschar says that although ZCCM's mines could yield another 4.2m tonnes
of copper over the next ten years, if there is no further investment, ZCCM's
reserves will virtually run out by then. That is why the Zambian government
wants to privatise the company.
Acknowledging that there has been some heated debate about this, he adds:
'But the debate is not about whether ZCCM should be privatised, it is simply
about the timing of privatisation'.
Copper mining provides about 95 per cent of Zambia's foreign exchange
earnings and contributes at least 15 per cent of the country's gross
domestic product, so some people in both the government and the company
would prefer to see ZCCM privatised sooner rather than later.
Analysts reckon that one big drawback to smooth privatisation is the number
of people ZCCM employs: 52,000. That equates to production last year of 8.3
tonnes per employee compared with RTZ's 118 tonnes a head at its Bingham
Canyon copper mine in the US.
But Mr Hanschar insists that, once cobalt revenue is taken into account,
ZCCM's cash costs are about 60 US cents a lb and that all-in costs are below
70 cents.
Mr Hanschar also suggests that ZCCM does not need to wait for privatisation
before pressing on with its life-saving Konkola project. The company is
looking for funding from the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the
European Investment Bank and other aid agencies and expects to get a
favourable response even though it is already in debt to the tune of Dollars
700m.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Spread on French 10-year paper narrows to
three basis points
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE yield spread between French and German 10-year government bonds crumbled
yesterday as investors piled into long-term French government paper and
German bonds were held back by the impact of a strong dollar.
The spread for 10-year benchmark bonds dated April 2003 narrowed to three
basis points by the close of trading from 10 basis points on Wednesday.
French long-dated bond futures for September jumped sharply on the Matif in
heavy turnover.
Dealers said the near-parity of the yield spread was prompting program-trade
selling, but that was countered by domestic buying as investors switched out
of the short end and extended along the yield curve.
The interest in French paper was sparked by news that Mr Edmond Alphandery,
the French economy minister, had invited representatives from the Bundesbank
and the German ministry of finance to visit Paris to discuss co-ordinated
interest cuts. Many economists saw the invitation - and Germany's subsequent
refusal - as part of the perceived power-play for the role of holder of the
anchor currency within the European exchange rate mechanism.
In the futures market, 10-year French bond contracts for September delivery
opened at 119.36 and were bought up to 119.80 before drifting in the
afternoon and closing 38 basis points higher at 119.74. Turnover was high,
with more than 165,000 contracts traded within the official dealing period.
GERMAN government bonds also benefited from rate cut hopes, but their
performance was hampered by the continuing strength of the US dollar against
the D-Mark. Bund futures for September rose from 95.12 to 95.33 although the
dollar broke through 1.71 against the D-Mark.
The Bundesbank said yesterday that although next week's repo funds would be
allocated on Thursday rather than Wednesday, in order to avoid
end-of-the-month pressures, the rate would be announced on Wednesday as
usual.
ITALIAN government bonds picked up after a repo rate cut raised hope of an
imminent easing in official interest rates.
US investment house Citibank is a strong buyer of Italian bonds. It argues
that the fundamentals are positive, the lira is firm and inflation is at the
same level as in Germany.
RUMOURS that the Spanish prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, had failed to
reach a coalition agreement with the minority Catalan party came too late to
affect the performance of the Spanish government bond market.
The September futures contract traded in Barcelona rose a further 10 basis
points to 93.85, although Mr Steve Major, economist with Credit Lyonnais and
a leading bull of the Spanish bond market, said he was preparing to turn
seller. 'Ten-year bonds have performed very well but I think they have run
too far now and there is scope for a correction.'
UK GILTS shrugged off the impending supply pressure of tap issues totalling
Pounds 850m and avoided profit-taking to continue their strong performance,
particularly at the long end.
The Bank of England announced a tap of Pounds 300m of 7 1/4 per cent stock
dated 1998, Pounds 400m of 8 per cent stock maturing in 2013 and Pounds 150m
of 2 1/2 per cent index linked stock dated 2013.
Dealers said that the combination of low inflation and slow growth made the
UK gilt market particularly attractive, and many expected long gilts to hit
new price highs and consequent yield lows.
Mr Ian Shepherdson of Midland Global Markets predicted that long gilt yields
would reach their lowest level for a quarter of a century.
He forecast a yield of 7 3/4 per cent by the end of the year for the 8 3/4
per cent stock maturing in 2017.
A FAVOURABLE jobless claims report lifted US Treasury prices across the
board yesterday.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  11/32 at 105,
yielding 6.730 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note
was up  3/32 at 99 15/16 , to yield 4.141 per cent.
The announcement that the number of people claiming state unemployment
insurance rose by 8,000 in the third week of this month surprised the
market, which had been expecting a decline in jobless claims. Consequently,
investors started buying Treasuries at both ends of the maturity range on
the latest piece of gloomy economic news.
Prices were also helped by some switching out of mortgage-backed securities
into government securities.
Investors were selling mortgage-backed securities because recent declines in
interest rates have raised concerns that mortgage prepayment levels could
increase.

first test for Dublin
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Irish Permanent Building Society is providing Dublin's new corporate
bond market with its first test, issuing IPounds 70m of an 8.5 per cent
Irish Permanent Bond 2004.
The bond was placed with domestic and foreign institutions by Davy
Stockbrokers in Dublin at a price of 99.35, giving a yield of 8.59 per cent.
A spokesman for Davy said that the issue was placed 'about 50:50 between
domestic and foreign institutions. There was a healthy appetite out there
for them.'
A corporate bond market has not existed in Dublin until now, because of a 1
per cent stamp duty payable on the issue and transfer of corporate bonds.
This duty was abolished last week with the publication of the 1993 Finance
Act.
The Irish Permanent bond is the first to take advantage of the new
fund-raising environment.
Mr Peter Fitzpatrick, finance director of Irish Permanent, said: 'The
success of our placing signals the importance this emerging market will have
for the funding activities of Irish companies.'
Mr Fitzpatrick pointed out that for lending institutions such as the Irish
Permanent, the corporate bond market gave greater flexibility for the future
in providing long-term funding for mortgage borrowers.
'Irish Permanent looks forward to a continuing role in developing the market
for Irish corporate bonds,' Mr Fitzpatrick said.
The bond will have coupon payments of 4.25 per cent made on January 15 and
July 15 each year, with final maturity on July 15 1994.
The bond will be listed and traded on the Irish Stock Exchange.
Irish Life, the insurance group, has placed 4m shares in the Dublin market
at 215p each, Davy Stockbrokers said.
Irish Life confirmed that the shares were placed by the insurance group's
own pension funds.

FT  25 JUN 93 / International Bonds: EIB surprises with further tranche of
Eurosterling offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Investment Bank raised a few eyebrows yesterday when it
launched a further tranche of its existing Eurosterling bond issue at the
same yield as the 8 per cent gilt due 2003.
The latest Pounds 400m tranche of the EIB's 8 per cent 10-year bonds brings
the total size of the issue up to Pounds 1bn, making it the largest
Eurosterling issue in the market.
The initial Pounds 400m tranche, launched in January, was priced to yield 13
basis points over the gilt, while the second tranche of Pounds 200m,
launched in March, was priced to yield 5 basis points over the gilt.
Since then, the yield spread in the secondary market has narrowed, with the
result that the EIB issue was trading at between two and three basis points
below the comparable gilt yield shortly before the latest tranche.
Salomon Brothers, the lead manager for yesterday's tranche, said that the
bond was trading in line with the gilt yesterday afternoon.
'It is extraordinary that the EIB can trade through gilts in this way,'
commented one analyst yesterday, referring to the fact that gilts are more
liquid and regarded as the top-quality sterling assets.
The proceeds were kept in fixed-rate sterling.
Dealers reported continued strong demand for Eurosterling paper, both from
domestic and overseas investors.
The latter are keen on sterling assets because they see scope for the pound
to appreciate against other European currencies.
In addition, Eurosterling yields are relatively high compared with those
available in other European currencies.
The EIB deal attracted considerable interest - partly because dealers were
glad to see the creation of a large liquid Eurosterling issue, and partly
because the maturity is the same as for the Bank of England's forthcoming
Pounds 3.25bn gilt auction.
However, dealers did not expect the EIB deal to detract from the auction,
given that there is plenty of demand for 10-year paper.
French borrowers tapped the international bond market for a total of FFr6bn
in longer-dated issues yesterday, attracted by the prospect of a further
rally in the French franc sector.
Eurobond dealers in France said that investors regard the eight to 12 year
maturity area as particularly attractive, given some forecasts that 10-year
French government bond yields could fall from around 6.7 per cent to 6 per
cent within 12 months.
Credit Foncier, which has a AA1/AA+ rating, raised FFr3bn of 10-year bonds
with a coupon of 6.75 per cent, priced to yield 27 basis points over the
relevant government bond.
Credit Lyonnais, which was the book-runner and joint lead manager for the
Credit Foncier deal, said the spread tightened fractionally.
However, the reaction among the other French Eurobond houses was mixed.
Some claimed the deal was priced too aggressively and that the spread
widened out slightly as the bonds proved hard to place, while others thought
the pricing was quite fair.
Credit Lyonnais itself launched a FFr2.5bn nine-year bond issue, which was
quickly raised to FFr3bn.
The bonds were priced to yield 70 basis points over the government bond,
which some dealers described as 'on the generous side' for a borrower with
an A1/AA- debt rating.

FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: United considers low-cost
airline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Airlines, the large Chicago-based carrier, is toying with the idea of
creating a 'new' low-cost airline to fly its short-haul domestic routes.
United stressed that the idea was only one of many possible cost-cutting
moves under consideration and no decision on this was likely for some
months. However, if such an idea was pursued, it conceded that the 'new
airline' might then be spun off to the existing shareholders in UAL,
United's parent company, via some kind of 'demerger' scheme.
Like many of its big competitors, United has found it difficult to make
money on short-haul domestic routes in the face of the US recession and
savage fare wars.
The 'big three' US carriers - American, United and Delta - have all
complained that they have difficulty competing with some of the more
financially-troubled carriers, who have won large pay concessions from their
employees.
Northwest Airlines, for example, is seeking pay concessions of nearly
Dollars 900m from employees over three years while Continental and USAir
have achieved similar goals.
United has been looking for ways to cut costs after it failed to secure
concessions from some of its own unions at the start of 1993. It has already
slashed planned expenditure on new aircraft, introduced a five per cent
salary cut for management, and axed several thousand jobs.
Herman's, the sporting goods chain which was owned until recently by
Britain's Isosceles group, is selling 21 stores in Washington, Arizona,
Utah, Idaho and Illinois to LPG Group, a joint venture company representing
three separate retail groups.
The deal will leave Herman's, which is now in bankruptcy, focusing on its
stores in the North-East. LPG Group will pay at least Dollars 550,000 for
the long-term leases on the stores and assume the liabilities and
obligations on the leases.

BIOCHEM Pharma, an associate in anti-Aids drugs development of Glaxo of the
UK, reports a first-quarter loss of CDollars 2.5m (USDollars 1.95m) after
special items, against a loss of CDollars 5m a year earlier. Revenues fell
to CDollars 8.6m from CDollars 9.7m.
BioChem, which was set up six years ago, is a research company primarily and
does not expect revenues from its diagnostics and vaccine businesses to
outweigh heavy research spending for another year or two.
Glaxo holds an 18 per cent interest in BioChem and is contributing around
CDollars 200m for the development of BioChem's 3TC anti-Aids drug now in
final clinical tests.
MDS Health, a supplier of medical testing services and distributor of
medical supplies and equipment, reports net profit of CDollars 7.8m for the
second quarter ended April, up from CDollars 6.49m a year earlier. Sales
were CDollars 166m against CDollars 110m.

FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: Nomura takes a long-term view of
chaos - The head of Japan's leading broker puts things into perspective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S political turmoil may be sending shivers through the financial
markets, but Mr Hideo Sakamaki, president of Nomura Securities, prefers to
view events as a historian rather than as a leading, world-scale
stockbroker.
He puts the chaos into a longer-term perspective, making it appear less
threatening and more logical. According to Mr Sakamaki, political upheaval
is a natural result of changes in the country's character, and a part of the
necessary demolition of reassuring myths that had seemed to be permanent
pillars of Japanese society.
'We have the high-growth myth, the myth of endless trust between the US and
Japan, full employment, and the myth that land and stock prices will always
rise. The other myth is that the Liberal Democratic Party will always remain
in power,' he says. 'It will be better for the country to go through this
change.'
The corporate rush to China also prompts a few steps backward by Mr
Sakamaki, who was appointed president of Nomura two years ago after a spate
of securities industry scandals. In describing business opportunities in
Asia, he wants to make clear that Nomura has not suddenly discovered Chinese
economic reform and does not presume that the profits will come thick and
fast.
'We opened a representative office in Beijing 11 years ago. We have been
involved in underwriting samurai bond issues for institutions like the Bank
of China,' he said. 'You need a long-term perspective. Over a decade or two
decades you can build a human network - that is how you do business in that
country.'
In May, Nomura transferred the control of Asian regional business from Tokyo
to Hong Kong, and while trimming staff in other areas, the broker increased
Asia department employees from 580 to 616 over the past year. The company is
also involved in an 'intelligent' office building in Beijing and a hotel in
Shanghai, which Mr Sakamaki benevolently described as returning a favour to
China.
But the long-term vision has limits, and Nomura cannot obviously afford the
investment indulgences of the late 1980s. Its net profit tumbled by almost
90 per cent last year. The other three big brokers, Daiwa Securities, Nikko
Securities, and Yamaichi Securities, reported net losses while results were
worse still among small brokerages, which suffered a serious bruising from
the fall in stock prices and turnover.
Nomura cut its graduate intake from 1,002 to 606 recruits this year, while
computer-related spending has fallen from Y44.8bn in the year ended March
1991 to Y18bn (Dollars 165m) in the year ended last March. Another sign of
trimming is the closure of 12 of 18 securities boutiques opened in
department stores and railway stations.
'It is easier to grow than to curtail something which has grown.
Restructuring is a very difficult issue. For Japanese, since we do not have
such experience, this will be a very painful thing indeed,' Mr Sakamaki
said.
He can take some credit for overcoming another phenomenon of the boom times,
scandal, which undermined investor confidence in the brokers and propelled
him to the top at Nomura. There were links between brokers and gangsters,
alleged stock price manipulation, and the compensation of favoured corporate
clients for investment losses.
Mr Sakamaki had been executive vice-president, and was close to Mr Yoshihisa
Tabuchi, 'Little Tabuchi,' the president, who was forced to resign in
mid-1991, while 'Big Tabuchi,' Mr Setsuya Tabuchi, resigned as chairman. The
departure of the two Tabuchis, who are not related, created a vacuum which
Mr Sakamaki has gradually filled.
The difficulties confronting the securities industry have prompted the
finance ministry to slow deregulation, a decision applauded by Nomura. Mr
Sakamaki argues that the industry is going through a 'correction phase'
because of over-capacity, and banks should not rush into the already
overcrowded securities business.
Since April, Japanese brokers have been allowed to establish trust banking
subsidiaries, while some banks can open securities subsidiaries able to
issue convertible and warrant bonds, and to deal in straight bonds.
Commissions on stock transactions of over Y1bn, accounting for just over 3
per cent of stock commissions, will be negotiable from next April, although
the industry wants to keep fixed commissions for other transactions.
In explaining the vulnerability of brokers, Mr Sakamaki emphasised that
their problems were very different from those of banks, which are burdened
by an accumulating pile of non-performing property loans made during the
easy money era of the late 1980s.
'For the banking system, the problems have only been deferred, they have not
been fundamentally resolved. But, for securities companies, the situation is
different. We are in a market-orientated system, and if there are any large
losses, they will be revealed - that's not something one can hide in one's
books.'

FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: Bosch to shed more jobs as
earnings tumble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOSCH, the privately-owned motor components, electronics and appliances
group, is to press ahead with further rigorous cost-cutting measures
following a 29 per cent drop in pre-tax earnings last year.
The workforce will once again bear the brunt of the group's attempts to
combat recession and vehicle makers' demands for cheaper components.
Bosch, which shed almost 11,000 employees last year, has already cut a
further 4,400 workers since January, and a further 6,000 will go by the year
end, Mr Marcus Bierich, retiring chairman, said yesterday.
In addition, cuts in employee fringe benefits - which cost more than DM1bn
(Dollars 600m) a year in the German parent alone - reduced capital spending
and lower material costs will save at least DM500m this year, he said.
Reviewing prospects for 1993, Mr Bierich said group turnover would fall for
the first time since the 1960s' recession. Bosch would remain profitable at
the pre-tax and net levels, but he was 'not sure' about operating earnings.
First-half sales were down 9.3 per cent at DM13bn, with domestic turnover 12
per cent lower and overseas business down only 3.4 per cent.
Turnover in vehicle components, 50 per cent of Bosch's business, was 14 per
cent lower for the six months after a 3.7 per cent gain to DM17bn for last
year as a whole.
A 10 per cent improvement in public telecommunications in the period to the
end of June, due to continuing installation work in eastern Germany, helped
this sector to restrict the sales fall to 4.4 per cent. Communications
technology divisions increased sales 3.2 per cent in 1992 to DM8bn.
Talks with Northern Telecom, of Canada, over collaboration in this sector
were continuing, and were 'not urgent,' Mr Bierich said.
Referring to efforts to build up a Bosch service network in China, he said
the first authorisation had required around 200 signatures.
Reporting on the group's 1992 performance, he said sales rose 2.5 per cent
to DM34.43bn, 'the smallest increase in percentage terms since 1971'.
Turnover in Europe, accounting for 85 per cent of the group total, was
restrained by the second-half downturn in the German market and a decline in
non-EC countries.
Pre-tax earnings fell to DM1.36bn from DM1.91bn in 1991 with net profits
down to DM512m from DM540m.

PAKTEL, Pakistan's largest mobile telephone company, plans to invest up to
Dollars 20m in improving quality of transmission, subject to availability of
more frequencies and wave bands, writes Farhan Bokhari.
Paktel was set up at a cost of Dollars 60m more than two years ago. It is a
joint project between Cable and Wireless, which has an 80 per cent stake,
and Karachi-based Hasan group, which has the remainder.
The company is one of two which have set up mobile telephone businesses in
Pakistan. Although market size remains limited, mobile telephones have
provided a new opportunity for many businesses and industries to consider
plans for setting up facilities in suburban and rural areas, where poor
telecommunications previously deterred investors.
The Pakistani government says that there are 2,500 mobile telephone
subscribers in Pakistan. Paktel says that it holds 65 per cent share of the
market.

INTERNATIONAL Business Machines named Mr Bernard Puckett to the new post of

Mr Puckett's promotion represents the first appointment of an IBM 'insider'
to a senior management position since the arrival of Mr Gerstner, formerly
chief executive of RJR Nabisco, on April 1.
Before Mr Gerstner's appointment, Mr Puckett had been regarded as a
potential candidate for chairman of IBM.
Mr Gerstner said: 'One of my initial priorities for IBM has been to identify
our strategic issues and opportunities and then drive aggressive action
programmes to move the company forward,' He said Mr Puckett would work
directly with him on this.
Mr Puckett, 48, previously headed IBM's Application Solutions business, one
of the key product groups in the company which focuses on developing
integrated systems for specific industry sectors and customers.

FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: Argentina pins hopes on YPF
offer - The crucial privatisation of a state oil producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM and DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE hopes and fears of Argentina's government are hanging on the outcome of
its biggest and most controversial privatisation yet. It hopes to raise
Dollars 3.54bnto Dollars 4.17bn from the YPF offer, making it one of the
world's largest privatisations this year.
If the sale of YPF, the national oil producer which is also Argentina's
biggest company, is judged a failure, it would be a humiliating reverse for
the government only four months before important mid-term legislative
Congressional elections.
But if a success, YPF will help to further the government's aim of spreading
Thatcherite popular capitalism in Argentina.
It would revitalise Argentina's sickly capital markets and bind them closer
to the international financial system. The government would also clear
political debts with pensioners, who will be one of the main beneficiaries
of the sale.
On June 28, the government will announce the price for the 59 per cent of
YPF on offer. The flotation will go ahead on July 8.
Some 31 to 35 per cent of YPF is to be earmarked for private investors.
International investors will make most of the running, since only 7 per cent
of the shares will be available on the local market. The remainderis being
offered to politically influential pensioners to make good billions of
dollars in unpaid benefits.
The government is pricing the offer very competitively. It has set a minimum
price of Dollars 17 per share and a maximum of Dollars 20, which is about 10
times net earnings, forecast to be Dollars 600m this year.
At a 20 per cent discount to the grey market price in Argentina, YPF is
attractive relative both to the Argentine stock market and other
international energy companies.
A Buenos Aires business consultant said YPF's attractions went beyond just a
low price: 'YPF is the biggest oil company in Argentina and it will be the
only integrated company on the stock market. It has an excellent market
position, with over half of every market segment. It has great profit
potential and it is well-managed.'
He reckons YPF could earn a net Dollars 700m this year, against Dollars 259m
in 1992. For 1993, he is forecasting profits of Dollars 1bn.
Many investors see YPF more as a cheaply-priced international energy company
than as a play on Argentina. 'A lot of international investors will buy it
as an oil and gas company and put it in an oil portfolio,' says Mr Terry
Mahony, of Baring America Asset Management. This has opened up the offering
to investors not normally interested in Argentina.
The privatisation is also benefiting from bullish sentiment about Latin
America. In recent months, several Latin companies have made large
international equity and debt offerings.
However, there seems to be less enthusiasm for YPF among individual
Argentine investors. The problem is that excessive speculation and a heavily
over-priced telephone company privatisation last year led to a market crash
that brought prices down by 48 per cent.
Mainly small, highly leveraged investors bought shares in Telecom Argentina
at Dollars 4.20, only to see its price sink by one-third and not yet
recover.
Banks and brokerages - which were also involved in the Telecom flotation -
are facing an uphill struggle in their battle to sell YPF shares to
individuals.
However, Mr Pablo Estrada, capital markets director at Buenos Aires' Banco
Roberts, said: 'Professional investors make rapid decisions. But it is in
the final days that you sell (to individuals). In fact, we are getting a
very large number of individuals' orders coming in and the same thing is
happening at other banks.'
Made wary by its experience with Telecom, the government, together with CS
First Boston and Merrill Lynch, YPF's global co-ordinators, has turned to
the book-building method to price its shares.
If the issue is oversubscribed, which increasingly seems to be likely, then
the government may not get the maximum possible price, but it will be
guaranteed a strong after-market.
The economy minister, Mr Domingo Cavallo, clearly hopes YPF will transform
the narrow and speculative Buenos Aires stock exchange into a broader and
more stable market, which would encourage companies to boost investment and
sustain economic growth.
However, not everyone is optimistic. Buenos Aires-based equities analyst Mr
Christopher Ecclestone says YPF is overpriced because government earning
forecasts are too optimistic.
He says first-quarter 1993 earnings of Dollars 78m were inflated by Dollars
38m in extraordinary earnings. Were it not for this, he says, profit would
have fallen by 37 per cent to Dollars 40m.
But if the deal succeeds, Wall Street expects many more Argentine companies
to follow YPF and offer equity in the US, just as Mexican companies followed
the landmark Telmex telecoms flotation in 1991.

boat offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REEBOK International, the US footwear maker, is to sell its Boston Whaler
unit to McAndrews &amp; Forbes, a boatbuilder and fishing sports company.
McAndrews &amp; Forbes, the second-largest independent boatbuilder in the US,
said Boston Whaler would become part of a newly-formed sports division,
focusing on fishing, scuba diving and water-skiing.
Reebok put Boston Whaler, which makes motor boats, up for sale last
December. The unit earned revenues of around Dollars 45m last year, less
than 2 per cent of Reebok's total of Dollars 3.02bn, but was not profitable.
Mr Paul Fireman, Reebok's chairman and chief executive, said the sale was
part of a strategy to concentrate on the lucrative but fiercely competitive
sports shoe market. 'It's the right time for Reebok to focus our energies on
our core brands: Reebok, Rockport and Avia.' he said.
Reebok has about 24 per cent of the US sport shoe market. Like Nike, the
market leader, it has recently suffered from sluggish growth in the US
retail sector.
It also put its Ellesse USA footwear unit up for sale last December but has
not found a buyer. The Boston Whaler sale will be complete by the end of
July and will not affect second-quarter earnings.

FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: Canada clears airline alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN Airlines International has cleared the last political hurdle to its
proposed alliance with American Airlines of Dallas, but still faces at least
three court challenges which could derail the deal.
The federal cabinet has dismissed an appeal by Air Canada, Canadian's main
rival, against a National Transportation Agency decision to approve the
deal. Mr Jean Corbeil, transport minister, said the government favours a
'strong, viable and competitive airline industry.'
Canadian has warned it will collapse if it cannot finalise the alliance with
American, which includes an equity injection of CDollars 246m (USDollars
192m) in return for a 25 per cent voting interest.
The deal remains clouded, however, by the condition that Canadian must join
American's Sabre computerised reservation system. Canadian has so far been
unable to extricate itself from the rival Gemini system, which it jointly
owns with Air Canada and Covia, a subsidiary of United Airlines.
Canadian yesterday called on the other Gemini partners to 'put their
differences aside and negotiate a commercial solution to Canadian's early
release' from the Gemini contract.
Air Canada, however, favours a merger of the two airlines and has
strenuously opposed Canadian's efforts to terminate the Gemini partnership.
Mr Robert Fay, analyst at Deacon BZW in Toronto, said yesterday that 'the
two sides are about as far apart as Toronto and Tokyo'.
He noted that, even if the Gemini-related lawsuits go in Canadian's favour,
the level of compensation might be unacceptably high for American.
Mr Fay said the chances of the alliance going ahead remain about '50-50'.
Shares of both Air Canada and PWA, Canadian's parent, rose slightly on the
Toronto stock exchange yesterday morning.

FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: Goodyear sees second-quarter
earnings rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber, the only surviving large US-owned tyre group,
yesterday forecast an increase in second-quarter earnings to between Dollars
130m and Dollars 140m on sales of around Dollars 3bn.
Second-quarter profits last year came to Dollars 106.9m and in 1991 were
Dollars 22.5m.
The forecast would signify further improvement in the once-troubled company.
Mr Stanley Gault, chairman, told analysts that the operating margin was
expected to approach the company's long-term objective of 10 per cent, with
plants operating near capacity worldwide.
Interest expense had been reduced, he said, as a result of a debt reduction
programme.
The strong second-quarter figures in a weak market suggest that the company
has continued to gain market share against its main European and Japanese
rivals, Michelin, Continental and Bridgestone/Firestone.
Goodyear increased its share of the US passenger vehicle tyre market last
year to 31.5 per cent, 1.5 percentage points more than 1991.
Ms Sue Zajac, a Goodyear spokeswoman, said growth was spread across all
segments of the tyre market, although the success of its Aquatred tyre in
the car market contributed most to revenues.
Goodyear's car tyre sales have been boosted by expanded distribution in
retail stores, such as Sears Roebuck.
The company has also benefited from aggressive brand advertising, up about
30 per cent on previous years, and demand from car companies for tyres on
new cars.
Ms Zajac said this was due both to increased market share and a rise in
second-quarter car production.
However, Mr Gault suggested that there was some concern with weak demand in
the sector, saying there was no strong recovery and that the economy was
'hesitant'.
The US passenger vehicle tyre market is expected to grow by just 1 or 2 per
cent this year, compared with 5 per cent last year.

FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: Reshuffle at Primerica's
securities division
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBERT Greenhill, a senior investment banker at Morgan Stanley and the
firm's former president, is joining Primerica's Smith Barney Shearson
securities brokerage unit as chairman and chief executive.
The appointment, the most significant move by a senior Wall Street figure in
several years, was part of an important reshuffling of management by Mr
Sanford Weill, chairman of the US financial services group.
Analysts say Mr Greenhill was hired to build an investment banking franchise
to complement Smith Barney Shearson's strengths in equities sales and
broking. Investors cheered the appointment, bidding Primerica stock up
Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 48 3/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Mr Frank Zarb, chairman of Smith Barney before its recent Dollars 1bn merger
with Shearson, was promoted to group chief executive of Primerica, as was Mr
Robert Lipp, former chairman of Primerica's Commercial Credit subsidiary.
The two will be responsible, along with Mr Weill, for running Primerica's
other interests, including asset management, consumer finance and credit
cards, and insurance.
The big news, however, was the arrival of Mr Greenhill, who only stepped
down as president of Morgan Stanley in March. Mr Greenhill revealed he had
bought Dollars 35m of Primerica stock with his own money to underline his
commitment to Smith Barney Shearson.
The company was formed this year with the merger of the retail stockbroking
and asset management side of Shearson Lehman, previously owned by American
Express, with Primerica's Smith Barney. The investment banking arm of
Shearson Lehman, however, was not part of the deal, and stayed with American
Express. This left the new Smith Barney Shearson without an established
investment banking operation.

FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: AEG, Schneider in talks on
co-operation accord
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AEG, the electrical engineering unit of Daimler-Benz, the German industrial
group, is in co-operation talks with Groupe Schneider, the French electrical
engineering and construction group.
The companies are discussing plans to pool resources in certain areas of
their electrical activities.
AEG said the talks were limited to exploring possible industrial
co-operation in automation technology and components manufacturing with a
view to strengthening the groups' international sales efforts.
AEG gave no indication of how long the talks had lasted. No concrete
co-operation agreement had been reached yet, it said. It said the talks were
similar to discussions which the company held regularly with other potential
industrial partners. This appeared to rule out the possibility of
underscoring any future partnership arrangement with Schneider with a share
exchange.
Schneider yesterday issued a statement saying it had no specific plans for
co-operative ventures with AEG at present.
The French group is in the process of restructuring its interests following
the takeover two years ago of Square D, the US construction company, which
left it burdened by heavy debts. It is now trying to raise capital through
asset sales, and earlier this year agreed to sell Jeumont-Schneider, its
electrical components subsidiary, to Framatome, the French nuclear reactor
concern.
Schneider has also been affected by the problems of Spie-Batignolles, its
troubled French construction subsidiary. The FFr274.3m (Dollars 49.24m)
losses from Spie curbed Schneider's growth last year. The group's net
profits rose modestly from FFr275m in 1991 to FFr305m in 1992, on sales of
FFr61.4bn.
AEG has reported a pre-tax profit of DM8m for last year. The German group's
operating losses rose to DM200m from DM100m in the previous year. Its
turnover reached DM11.6bn in 1992, of which approximately a half was
generated areas of potential co-operation with Schneider.

FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: BNP warns of sharp decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANQUE Nationale de Paris (BNP), one of France's largest banks and a key
target for privatisation by the new French government, yesterday warned of a
substantial fall in net profits for the first half of the year.
The bank, which recently reported a 26 per cent reduction in net profits to
FFr2.17bn (Dollars 380m) last year, said its commercial banking business was
performing well. However, it said it would have to make hefty provisions on
its exposure to small businesses in France and to sovereign loans.
As a result, BNP anticipates a sharp slide in net profits for the first half
of the year, to between FFr500m and FFr550m, against FFr1.33bn in the same
period of 1992. Unless the economic situation improves, it expects the same
trend to continue in the second half of this year.
Despite the profits warning, BNP is still committed to privatisation. The
bank, originally scheduled for sale to the private sector in the mid-1980s
by the last centre-right French government, is expected to be one of the
first issues in the new privatisation drive.
Mr Michel Pebereau, who chaired Credit Commercial de France during its
privatisation in 1987, last month replaced veteran Mr Rene Thomas as
chairman of BNP with a brief to prepare the bank for sale.
BNP's problems in the first half are reflected across French banking, which
has been hit by the impact of the recession on demand for credit, and on the
small business sector. BNP will also suffer in 1993 because of further
provisions on sovereign loans; last year it was able to claw back FFr1.7bn
in surplus provisions.
Despite these pressures, BNP estimates net banking income will rise 6 per
cent during the first half, mainly due to growth from foreign activities. It
also expects a 10 per cent increase in gross operating profits.

<TEXT>
STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, and Neste, the Finnish state oil
and chemicals group, have agreed to merge their petrochemicals businesses to
form Europe's largest polyolefins producer and the fifth biggest in the
world.
The deal is one of the largest Nordic industrial mergers and marks a
significant step in the restructuring of Europe's petrochemicals industry,
the companies said. Polyolefins are plastics such as polypropylene and
polyethylene.
Because Neste's petrochemicals business is more than twice the size of
Statoil's, it will receive 'several billion kroner' in cash from Statoil
when the company is established.
The jointly-owned company, which is yet to be named, should be operational
by early 1994. It will employ more than 6,000 people and have annual revenue
of Dollars 2.5bn.
Annual polyolefins capacity will be 2.1m tonnes. Plastics processing will be
pursued through Statoil's EuroParts subsidiary in Sweden and other entities.
It will have production units in 10 countries and sales offices throughout
western Europe, the US and south-east Asia. It will enjoy unique access to
feedstock through Statoil's extensive gas production interests.
Statoil and Neste also aim to exchange shareholdings in a number of oil and
gas fields on the Norwegian continental shelf so that Neste can acquire
producing assets in the North Sea while Statoil will acquire non-producing
assets in the Norwegian Sea off the mid Norwegian coast.
Mr Terje Wareberg, Statoil group executive vice-president, said the company
would be established with 'substantial' capital to make it financially
robust and highly competitive.
Although the deal is to be finalised in the autumn, management will be
appointed within weeks. The chairman will be chosen by Statoil and the chief
executive by Neste.
The new company's headquarters will be outside Norway and Finland, most
likely in Brussels.
'This is a major industrial move within the Nordic community and is a
necessary and healthy restructuring of an industry which has been hard hit
by over-capacity and weak demand,' Mr Wareberg said.
Mr Jaakko Ihamoutila, chairman and chief executive of Neste, said the deal
would establish a basis for further co-operation with Statoil in the natural
gas industry.

PHILIPS Kommunikations Industrie, a German subsidiary of the diversified
Dutch electrical group, expects a loss of DM100m (Dollars 60.20m) in the
first six months of this year following a 20 per cent drop in sales.
The Nuremberg-based company, which last week announced plans to cut 1,500
jobs this year, had earlier reported a 23 per cent fall in turnover during
the first quarter, and a 36 per cent slump in incoming orders.
PKI said yesterday it planned a quick change of course to concentrate its
efforts on four core sectors: public and private communications systems, and
radio and mobile radio businesses.
The company, which incorporates the Grundig home entertainment and
electronics business, is negotiating to sell its cable activities to NKF
Holding of Delft.
The job cuts and sales of activities will leave PKI with a total workforce
of 3,400, compared with 6,300 at the end of April.
The company last year made a net DM82m on sales of DM2.3bn.

 -Statoil and Neste have created a new force
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN IMPORTANT step towards remedying the ills of Europe's petrochemicals
industry was taken yesterday through the planned merger of plastics
businesses of Statoil and Neste Corporation.
The aim of the deal and other similar moves is to create a competitive
company with sufficient backbone to emerge from the industry's depression in
shape to benefit from an upturn expected during the second half of the
decade.
Earlier this year Shell, the world's biggest petrochemicals producer, and
Himont, the big Italian producer, announced plans to merge part of their
operations. EniChem and BP Chemicals are seeking to merge styrene
production; at BASF and ICI it's polypropylene production.
The two Nordic groups say the aim was to build further on the best areas in
the two groups to attain a stronger technological, market and organisational
position.
'Specifically, marketing structures will be co-ordinated to avoid
duplication of effort, operations rationalised at production plants . . .
administrative costs reduced by taking advantage of economies of scale, and
research development activities integrates,' they added.
Demand is set to rise and annual polyethylene and polypropylene sales will
grow by between 1 and 4 per cent and 5 and 7 per cent respectively, the
companies forecast.
They also believe the pace of capacity expansion in Europe has slowed.
'Without new capacity, polypropylene could reach market balance by 1996 and
polyethylene a few years later.'
According to Mr Jaakko Ihamoutila, Neste's chairman, the merger is an
example of how restructuring of Europe's petrochemicals industry should be
undertaken. 'But other players in the market must also take action,' he
says.
The rationale for the merger is that it is their best chance to become more
cost-effective, better-sized and stronger in terms of marketing and
technology. This, they believe, is crucial to their survival.
It also removes the fierce competition which exists between them, and
eliminates Statoil's upper hand over Neste as its main supplier of feedstock
in Sweden.
Mr David Glass, director of London-based Chem Systems, consultants, says
this is an important development as it reduces the number of players, which
will benefit the industry at a time when profitability is 'at an all-time
low'.
'The deal also reduces the number of low-density producers from 13 to 12;
the number of high-density producers from 15 to 14; and polypropylene
producers from 17 to 16,' Mr Glass said. A recent report by Chem Systems
claims that cash costs for a competitive European ethylene producer are
roughly 30 per cent above the US level, and even higher than in the Middle
East.
Statoil's ethane feedstock supplies will give the new company a competitive
edge over its European rivals, which mostly use naphtha.
'Statoil, as an international oil company, has made a clear decision that
petrochemicals and plastics will remain an important part of its business in
the future,' said Mr Harald Norvik, chief executive of Statoil. 'In a very
competitive business environment we need a solid strategic platform to meet
our objectives. The new company creates this base.'
Statoil's petrochemicals and plastics business account for 7 per cent of the
group's annual turnover. In 1992, the division's sales fell to NKr5.51bn
(Dollars 773m) from NKr6bn in 1991 as operating losses widened to NKr438m
from NKr30m. Neste's net chemicals sales in 1992 rose 13 per cent to
FM10.1bn (Dollars 1.78bn).
The merged group will be Europe's largest producer of polyolefins, and is
among the 10 biggest worldwide. Its annual production capacity of 1.5m
tonnes is equal to 10 per cent of western European capacity.
The company will have petrochemicals and/or polyolefins production in
Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and in the US.
It will also have interests in production companies in Saudi Arabia and
Malaysia.

FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: The lines that led to a formula for success
 -The rise of Shoprite, one of a new breed of hard discounters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE checkout in Shoprite's discount food store in Cowcaddens, Glasgow, a
customer prods Mr Charles Good, managing director for Scotland, in the
chest.
'When are you going to open one of these in Lennoxtown?' he asks in a thick
Glaswegian accent. 'I'm sure you'd do a good trade there.'
Such occurrences are not uncommon. Last week Mr Good had a letter from a
family who claimed to be saving Pounds 1,500 a year by shopping at Shoprite.
Another fan recently relocated 75 miles from his nearest branch wrote to say
it was still cheaper for him to do his monthly shop at Shoprite even after
making a 150-mile round trip.
Those stories help explain why Shoprite has become one of the UK's
fastest-growing food retailers, and has won the approval both of shoppers
and of the City of London.
Since branching out from its base on the Isle of Man and launching in
Scotland in 1990, it has opened 50 stores and expects to be 'nudging 70' by
the end of this year.
The latest store, in Paisley, opened only last week and a second
distribution centre opened at Cumbernauld last month to supplement the one
it acquired from Safeway at Cambuslang in 1990.
The group announced on Wednesday a 62 per cent increase in interim pre-tax
profits to Pounds 1.69m, and analysts are forecasting Pounds 4.8m for the
full year compared with Pounds 2.7m in 1992.
Shoprite is one of the new breed of hard discounters spreading across the UK
but unlike other main exponents - Germany's Aldi, Denmark's Netto and
France's Ed - it is a home-grown format not proven first elsewhere.
The man behind Shoprite, however, is Mr Deryck Nicholson, whose father Ken
was a co-founder of Kwik Save, now the UK's largest discount grocer.
Mr Nicholson has been steeped in the discount culture since he was pulled
out of school at 16 to work in one of his father's stores for two shillings
an hour.
He has made Shoprite a model of the limited-line, hard discounter.
Firstly, prices are pared to the bone. 'We don't charge what the market will
bear, but the lowest price we can and still make a return,' says Mr
Nicholson.
Margins are correspondingly low - Shoprite claims they are the lowest in the
retail trade, but will not reveal the precise figure. Discounting, according
to the Nicholson philosophy, is about 'intelligent loss of margins'.
The idea is that low prices stimulate large sales volumes and Shoprite aims
to maximise this by selling fewer than 1,000 lines, compared with more than
15,000 in a typical Sainsbury or Tesco superstore. Those lines make up about
80 per cent of the average family's weekly shop, and hence are the
fastest-moving.
The next element in the formula is keeping both capital and operating costs
low. Stores are sited in cheaper, secondary locations, and Shoprite is happy
to convert old car showrooms or snooker halls. When it does build new
stores, the designs are clean and bright, but basic.
'If you look at us from an interior decorator's point of view, you'll be
surprised,' admits a cardboard sign at the entrance to Shoprite's store at
Whitburn, Lothian. 'No frills, no soft lights, no kidding.'
The advantages are obvious. Last year, capital spending was Pounds 13.8m -
less than the average cost of one superstore for the likes of Sainsbury's -
and Shoprite opened 22 stores.
Stores are designed to minimise costs and maximise speed of turnover. Goods
are sold off warehouse shelves from cardboard boxes with one side sliced
off. Chilled cabinets open out into walk-in freezers behind, so that as
goods are sold at the front, staff load fresh goods from the back.
That, coupled with efficient stock handling, means Shoprite's stock turn
rate - average stock divided by sales - is 'the best in the industry',
according to Mr Nicholson.
The result is that most goods are sold before they are paid for, so the
company's suppliers effectively provide its working capital.
Shoprite differs from some of its hard discount competitors in its
investment in technology. Goods are scanned at the checkouts, and the sales
information transmitted to Cambuslang where it triggers re-ordering of
goods.
The UK's biggest food retailers are only now introducing similar sales-based
ordering systems.
Another important Shoprite strategy is to rent out in-store concessions to
local butchers and greengrocers, rather than trying to sell fresh fruit,
vegetables and meat itself - a high-cost business requiring special skills.
That means it can offer a full range of goods to customers without incurring
extra costs, while receiving a useful rental income.
Shoprite, until now the only hard discounter in Scotland, faces an
increasingly tough environment as both Netto and Kwik Save have announced
plans to expand north of the border.
Mr David Webster, deputy managing director, is unconcerned. He expects the
discount sector to have 25 per cent of the Pounds 4bn Scottish grocery
market by 1996, trading from 350 stores.
He forecasts that Shoprite will have 200 of those stores, and a 15 per cent
market share - worth Pounds 600m a year. But Sassenachs take note - Shoprite
is likely to open its first sites in England before the end of next year.

FT  25 JUN 93 / The Property Market: Costly journey overseas - The Swedes'
disastrous record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London &amp; Edinburgh Trust, a UK property company bought by Swedish insurer
SPP three years ago, has won itself a place in the record books. Its Pounds
448.6m pre-tax loss for 1992 is one of the largest in the UK property
industry. But the real significance of the loss is its likely impact on
Swedish investors. It is another example of the disastrous property losses
they have suffered at home and abroad.
SPP's acquisition of LET was part of a wave of Swedish property investment
across Europe after exchange controls were relaxed by the Swedish
authorities in the late 1980s.
The freedom to invest money outside Sweden triggered spending of SKr100bn
(Pounds 8.84bn) on foreign property between late 1987 and the end of the
decade - more than twice the figure invested in foreign shares over the same
period.
This surge of investment, which was prompted by a desire to diversify from
the overheated domestic market, could hardly have occurred at a worse time.
After some early successes in Belgium and the Netherlands, the Swedes
invested in new markets, notably London, which were close to their peak and
heading for a steep fall.
To make matters worse, many companies were highly geared. Entrepreneurs
often borrowed abroad on the strength of capital which had been raised by
borrowing against their Swedish property.
At the time, Swedish investors were considered to be paying excessively for
property, perhaps because they used inflated domestic prices as their
benchmark. They were also unusually adventurous. Instead of opting for
investment properties in established locations, they preferred building
their own developments.
Consider, for instance, some of the more prominent Swedish-built buildings
in London. Swedish investors are heavily represented in Docklands, London's
worst-hit property market, with Skanska's 550,000 sq ft largely unlet Thomas
More Square and East India Dock, a 600,000 sq ft, mostly unlet office scheme
on the edge of the Docklands, which is jointly owned by NCC, a construction
company, and SPP.
Hammersmith, another fringe location in west London, was chosen as the site
of the Ark, a strikingly unconventional building which - in spite of
numerous architecture awards - is also unlet. It was built by Ake Larson
Byggare, a Swedish contractor, which went into receivership earlier this
year.
The problems encountered by Swedish developers abroad demonstrate the
difficulties of operating overseas. Swedish companies' undoubted
construction and design skills did not stand them in sufficient stead in
London, where tenants place greater emphasis on good location than on
quality, certainly more so than their counterparts do in Sweden. 'They did
not take enough account of local factors,' says Sir Julian Berney of Jones
Lang Wootton, chartered surveyors.
The losses endured by Swedish investors overseas have played a prominent
part in the recriminations over how the Swedish financial sector got into
its present problems. Allegations of fraud and negligence by lenders are
also recurring themes in the debate about where responsibility should lie
for Swedish property losses.
The best explanation for the property predicament lies in the behaviour of
the Swedish banking system following its deregulation in 1985. This
triggered an explosion in credit, much of which was directed towards
property; at the time property was a highly tax-efficient investment.
The banks competed vigorously for property loans, lending up to 90 per cent
of a property's value. 'The banks had a philosophy of growing by volume. The
more you could lend the better,' says Mr Magnus Dager, a consultant for
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley and a former president of the Swedish Property
Federation.
If the banks are blamed for inflating property prices, then the Swedish
government is held responsible for pricking the bubble. 'For decades the
politicians have said they would fight inflation. When they did, it took
people unawares,' says Mr Sten Westerberg of Swedish financial advisers
Westerberg &amp; Co. The government's assault on inflation more than doubled
real interest rates to 10 per cent-plus in 1991-92.
Rising interest rates together with the worsening recession sent property
prices down as fast as they had risen. Since the mid-1990 prices have fallen
by more than 50 per cent, putting at risk more than half of the SKr275bn in
commercial property loans held by Swedish banks, says one broker.
As the scale of these potential losses became evident, Sweden's centre-right
government took on the politically unpopular task of bailing out the banking
system at a time when it is trying to reduce a rising public sector deficit.
The government has created a 'bank support authority' to administer state
aid which has so far totalled SKr74bn in cash, loans and guarantees.
Problematic loans will be put into so-called 'bad banks' - a newly-created
holding company for the bad loans.
These 'bad banks' will remain in state hands while the rump of the parent
banks are sold off. The result is that the government is likely to retain
responsibility for these assets for years to come. The legacy of the
ill-starred investments of the late-1980s may dog the economy for a decade
or more.

FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: ML now in profit after Pounds 11m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ML HOLDINGS, the loss-making aerospace, defence and electronics group which
launched a rescue rights issue in January, yesterday confirmed that it was
now trading profitably.
As flagged at the time of the Pounds 14.3m rights issue, substantial
provisions increased losses in the year to March 31. Turnover was flat at
Pounds 84.9m but the pre-tax deficit rose from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 11.2m.
Losses per share emerged at 18.4p (8.6p). There was no dividend.
Under FRS 3, the pre-tax loss was swollen by provisions totalling Pounds
7.9m, marginally more than expected at the time of the cash call.
The workforce fell by 15 per cent to 1,300 over the year, and the provisions
included Pounds 3.5m for redundancy payments and surplus capacity costs.
Mr Howard Grant, who joined ML as chief executive in September from BTR, the
conglomerate, said the cost base had now been brought in line with market
conditions and he did not envisage any more big job losses.
ML wrote off Pounds 1.1m on stock provisions, Pounds 800,000 on product line
closures and Pounds 1.1m in settlement of a long-running legal action over a
hovercraft supply contract. In addition the value of certain properties was
written down by Pounds 1.4m.
The rights issue proceeds cut gearing from 114 per cent to 60 per cent. Mr
Grant said the group had strengthened both management and board and also
introduced stricter controls in finance contracting and pricing.
ML suffered severe cash pressures during the second half of the year, as its
bankers had reduced credit available. This limited the ability of some
subsidiaries to procure materials and load their factories efficiently.
Customer service suffered and consequently losses mounted rapidly.
The group incurred extra costs of Pounds 600,000, comprising legal fees,
costs of the rights issue and compensation for Mr Peter Pollock, who
departed as chief executive last June.

FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Kelt Energy gets exceptional boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS helped Kelt Energy, the oil exploration and production
group, report pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.68m for the 12 months to March 31,
against Pounds 163,000 last time.
The outcome reflected refunds of Pounds 3m from the Carless pension scheme,
which Kelt took over in 1988, and a release of provisions from the US.
Operating profits increased 29 per cent to Pounds 2.97m (Pounds 2.31m) as
production rose 42 per cent to 5,340 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Mr
Hubert Perrodo, chairman, said he expected production to double to 10,000
b/d by the end of the year.
Mr Perrodo has a 75 per cent stake in the company following its
restructuring two years ago when a group of banks took over some of its
exploration and production assets in return for writing off its debt.
Since then, Kelt has built a niche in the oil industry by looking to take
over marginal assets from large oil companies and cutting costs in order to
make them profitable.
It has taken over an oilfield in Gabon, cutting operating costs from Dollars
18m a year to Dollars 11.2m (Pounds 7.4m); production is running at 8,000
b/d.

FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Bloom returns with Pounds 3.5m Union buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DESMOND Bloom, the property entrepreneur, yesterday announced that
Vizcaya Holdings, a USM-quoted shell company that he joined last December,
had bought Union Group, a private property group for Pounds 3.47m.
The acquisition is accompanied by a Pounds 2.2m vendor placing to help
finance the deal and a Pounds 1.8m rights issue for working capital.
He said the deal represented 'the first step in the creation of a property
investment company that will be seeking to make its mark over the coming
years'.
Vizcaya, a former zinc mining company, will be renamed Premier Land and will
move up from the USM to the Official List. Its shares, which were suspended
at 5 3/4 p on April 20 because of the impending acquisition, are expected to
resume trading on July 20.
Union Group has a Pounds 40.7m property portfolio.
Vizcaya will pay Pounds 2.2m in cash for Union Group by the placing of 44.5m
vendor placing shares. The balance of Pounds 1.25m will be paid by the issue
to the vendors of 25m shares.
Mr Bloom is to be granted an option to subscribe for 5m shares, or 3 per
cent of the company, at 6p per share.
In addition to the vendor placing shares, the company is raising Pounds 1.8m
by a 2-for-5 rights issue of 22.2m shares at 5p per share and a placing of
14.3m shares at the same price. The issue is underwritten by Guinness Mahon.
Mr Bloom, a former guitarist and boxer, was one of the more colourful
figures in the property industry in the 1980s. Dwyer, a one-time textile
company, briefly became the best performing share on the stock market but
its value collapsed as the property market declined. He was replaced as
chief executive of Dwyer last November when the directors decided his Pounds
250,000 salary could not be justified.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Tobacco wars claim a victim in the food sector: The death of
RJR's move to cut debt in a 'smoke-free' zone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The curse of Philip Morris is proving powerful and enduring.
On April 2, the big tobacco and consumer products company decided to slash
the price of Marlboro cigarettes, its top-selling brand. That immediately
caused mayhem in the lucrative tobacco industry, where rivals - notably RJR
Nabisco - scrambled to match the Marlboro move. A price war began.
But the repercussions of Philip Morris's action have extended beyond the
tobacco industry, hitting RJR in another business segment regarded as
'smoke-free'. It has led indirectly to the 11th-hour withdrawal of RJR
Nabisco's plan to raise Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) by issuing shares pegged
to the performance of its food division.
The slashing of the price of a brand as well known as Marlboro underlined
the vulnerability of brands in general in a recession. It also highlighted
the extent to which less profitable 'own label' products were gaining sales.
The same worries migrated to food stocks which suffered too. The Dow-Jones
US food sector index, for example, has dropped by about 10 per cent since
the beginning of March.
This 'derating' of food stocks has cost RJR Nabisco more than Dollars 1.5bn,
the very sum it was hoping to raise by selling 93m food-linked shares. The
shares (to be known as RN-Nabisco stock) would have represented about a
quarter of the food company's equity, with the parent company holding the
remaining 75 per cent.
RJR Nabisco, whose food brands include Oreo cookies and Planters peanuts,
had indicated a price range for the offering of Dollars 17-Dollars 19 a
share. At Dollars 18, it would have been selling the new shares at about 14
times prospective 1993 earnings, roughly in line with other big food
companies. But, after an extensive marketing campaign, the company's bankers
admitted that they could not round up enough takers at this price and, on
Wednesday morning, RJR decided not to lower it.
Those involved in the issue suggest that there was reluctance on the part of
the large growth-oriented mutual funds, who would have been the key to the
issue's success. 'They want to be underweight in this sector,' commented one
banker.
Whether food sector weakness is the whole story behind the RJR decision is a
moot point. For a start, the Nabisco food business is more heavily biased
towards the highly competitive US market than some rivals' activities. This
is because RJR sold many international food interests to reduce the Dollars
30bn debt taken on in the record-breaking leveraged takeover of the company
in 1989. Although it has been rebuilding overseas operations, these remain
modest: Nabisco Food America had sales of Dollars 5.94bn and operating
profits of Dollars 682m in 1992, for example, while at Nabisco
International, the figures were Dollars 766m and Dollars 87m.
A more fundamental worry was whether the new shares would have counted as a
food sector stock anyway. This was not going to be a full demerger of RJR's
food division. Although the RN-Nabisco shares were supposed to reflect the
earnings progress of the food manufacturing assets, there was to be no legal
separation of this business from RJR's tobacco division - with all the
litigation and ethical investment baggage that this entails. In the words of
one analyst: 'This was not a pure food company and, therefore, it shouldn't
have traded at an equivalent multiple.'
Whatever the reasons, there are three losers. The first is RJR, which is
denied Dollars 1.5bn. The cash would have reduced borrowings from the
current Dollars 14bn, cutting interest payments. Offsetting this benefit,
however, was the potential dividend bill for the RN-Nabisco shares, which
was expected to absorb almost Dollars 200m annually. That will now be saved.
This largely explains Wall Street's phlegmatic response to the cancelled
issue. RJR shares edged higher on Wednesday and were holding at Dollars 5
1/2 yesterday, with some analysts relieved the company had not pursued the
RN-Nabisco sale at a lower price.
The big rating agencies also affirmed the group's 'investment grade' debt
standings, although Standard &amp; Poor's qualified this by saying the rating
outlook was 'negative' due to cigarette wars.
Fitch, for example, calculates RJR's annual cash flow is just over Dollars
4bn. Almost Dollars 3bn is needed to fund interest payments, dividends,
taxes, capital spending and working capital. 'This leaves a considerable
cash cushion of almost Dollars 1.2bn for debt reduction, acquisitions, or
other corporate purposes. This cushion is sufficient to see RJR through the
current price war in the tobacco industry without damage to its existing
credit ratings,' said its analysts.
RJR's debt maturities are reckoned to average about Dollars 200m over the
next few years - not a problematic amount. And there may be scope for
refinancing RJR's most expensive debt - something which the company has been
doing continually since the takeover.
But with the shadow cast by the cigarette price wars, no one denies RJR will
have its work cut out to get its fast-sinking share price moving upwards
again. This is particularly bad news for Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts, the
leveraged buy-out specialists who led the Dollars 25bn takeover of RJR. The
KKR-run buy-out fund owns more than half RJR's ordinary shares and has seen
their value halve over the past 18 months.
Finally, the aborted sale will leave many Wall Street investment houses
millions of dollars poorer. According to Securities Data, total underwriting
fees on initial public offerings this year have averaged about 7.4 per cent
of the issue proceeds. Their consolation is that IPOs are running at heady
levels, and the record-breaking Dollars 2.1bn flotation of Allstate
Insurance earlier this month went smoothly.

FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: TI venture to take lead in aircraft landing
gear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TI, the specialist engineering group, yesterday said it is to set up a joint
venture between its Dowty aerospace division and Messier-Bugatti of France,
in what would become the world's largest aircraft landing gear manufacturer.
The combined business would have annual sales of about Pounds 270m and would
account for more than a third of the world's medium and heavy landing gear
market, ahead of US rivals, Menasco and Cleveland Pneumatic.
The move is the latest example of European consolidation within the
aerospace industry. The venture will help TI and Messier to reshuffle
production more efficiently between its plants which are mostly operating
well below capacity.
Mr Tony Edwards, head of the Dowty aerospace division, said the joint
venture would create the only global landing gear maker, with plant in the
US, the UK and France.
'It is time for consolidation,' Mr Edwards said. 'Half of this joint venture
is a better business prospect than going it alone.'
Over the past two years aircraft production rates had fallen by 30-40 per
cent. A key element of the joint venture would be to shift some production
to Dowty's new Montreal facility which is working at about 40 per cent of
capacity.
The new venture will be called Messier-Dowty and TI will have management
control, supplying the chairman, the chief executive and the finance
director.
Mr Jean-Paul Bechat, chairman and chief executive of Messier-Bugatti, a
subsidiary of Snecma, the state-owned aero-engine group, welcomed the
collaboration. 'The venture will not resolve all the aerospace problems,' he
said. 'The joint venture offers good possibilities in the medium and
long-term future and is not a measure for the six months to come.'
'Dowty was a potential world leader at the time of the takeover (by TI last
year)', said Mr Edwards. 'We realised at the time that we would need to
bring something else together to be world leaders.'
Mr Edwards said projections of aerospace orders made at the time of the
Dowty takeover last year were still being met for 1993-94. But for the next
year, current projections were 10 per cent lower than its original
assumptions because of delayed recovery in aircraft orders and Dowty had
been forced to accelerate its restructuring programme.
There will be a delay of a couple of months before the new joint venture
company is incorporated.
Messier and TI first crossed paths in 1937 when engineers from the French
company were given hangar space by the then Mr George Dowty. Dowty then
produced landing gear actuation equipment under license before Rotol, a
joint venture of Rolls Royce and Bristol bought British Messier in 1949. Ten
years later Dowty bought out Rotol.

FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: TSB emphasises return to core - Interest
income hit by customers' move to higher interest accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TSB GROUP'S half year results yesterday showed the efforts it is making
to concentrate on what it regards as its core business of selling banking
services and savings and insurance products to personal customers.
This involves trying to manage down or sell other businesses such as its
Hill Samuel merchant banking arm, and re-shaping its 'bancassurance'
business which combines its retail banking and insurance sales operations.
The re-shaping of this business involves significant short-term costs
including staff redundancies, and a controversial push to transfer
customers' savings into higher interest-bearing accounts in order to keep
them.
Mr Peter Ellwood, chief executive, emphasised that TSB was now 'sticking to
the knitting' after three years of sustaining large bad debts on peripheral
businesses. It was trying to drive down costs, while selling more retail
products.
Trading profits for retail banking and insurance operations rose to Pounds
206m (Pounds 192m) before restructuring costs of Pounds 37m involving a 900
cut in staff. Operating costs fell by Pounds 4m to Pounds 367m as staff
costs fell by Pounds 13m.
Overall headcount fell from 37,317 to 33,568 over the 12 months to April and
the company expects to continue reducing staff at a lower rate.
Interest income was depressed by the continuing policy of advising customers
to move from old savings accounts which do not pay rates of interest
competitive with Halifax Building Society, which it regards as its main
competitor.
Net interest income fell 5 per cent from Pounds 422m to Pounds 399m as low
interest deposits fell. They have been reduced from Pounds 5.4bn in 1990 to
Pounds 2bn in April, while high interest accounts have grown from Pounds
1.8bn to Pounds 6.2bn in the same period.
Mr Ellwood said that the strategy, which will continue to depress net
interest income over the next 18 to 24 months, would be repaid by the bank
being able to retain customers and being able to sell them other products
such as insurance.
Non-interest income from banking rose only slightly to Pounds 158m (Pounds
152m), while insurance income rose to Pounds 183m (Pounds 153m) helped by
general insurance sales.
In common with other banks, TSB also achieved a large rise in mortgage sales
through its branch network. Mortgages balances rose by 21 per cent to Pounds
5.2bn (Pounds 4.3bn), the majority of the rise coming from fixed rate
mortgages.
Mr Ellwood indicated yesterday that TSB would try to reinforce such
'cross-selling' of products to its banking customers in future if it
re-introduced charges on current accounts in credit, as most banks are now
considering.
He said that TSB had no immediate plans to introduce such charges. However,
only 15 per cent of its 4.5m customers now incurred charges, and such
cross-subsidisation among accounts was inherently unsustainable beyond two
or three years.
He added that TSB would try to reflect relationships in any charging
structure. This is likely to mean that charges may be waived for customers
who hold other savings products or mortgages with the bank as well as a
current account.
Retail group profits advanced by 8 per cent before provisions for bad and
doubtful debts and insurance claims to Pounds 322m (Pounds 298m), but there
was a Pounds 12m rise in provisions to Pounds 72m (Pounds 60m) as the
recovery remained modest.
Provisions for branch mortgages remained low at 0.1 per cent of balances,
Pounds 3m against the Pounds 5.2bn book. But provisions against other forms
of personal lending rose to Pounds 44m (Pounds 35m), or 2 per cent of
balances, against 1.5 per cent.

FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions boost Intercare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACQUISITIONS helped Intercare Group, the healthcare products supplier,
increase sales by 63 per cent and pre-tax profits by 20 per cent in the six
months to April 30.
Turnover came to Pounds 17.7m (Pounds 10.8m) and profits to Pounds 1.68m
(Pounds 1.4m).
Mr Peter Cowan, chairman, said the drop in margins reflected the acquisition
of the less profitable optical business, tighter market conditions and the
impact of recession in Europe. However, all existing business had lifted
sales by at least 10 per cent.
The biggest division, which makes mobility scooters for the elderly and
disabled, increased trading profits from Pounds 659,000 to Pounds 727,000.
Mr Cowan said the division continued to perform well, in spite of the
general downturn throughout Europe. This had delayed the development of
export markets outside the Netherlands, in particular Germany.
The optical products side moved ahead from Pounds 388,000 to Pounds 503,000.
This reflected significant expansion of Pennine Optical, and a full
six-month contribution from Birmingham Optical.
Medical products expanded from Pounds 348,000 to Pounds 446,000. The group
has extensively reorganised SAFA, which supplies first aid and healthcare
products to large corporate customers, since acquiring it last year.
Earnings per share dipped from 4.2p to 4.1p while the interim dividend is
increased to 0.7p (0.6p).

FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Stoddard Sekers halved
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOLLOWING halved profits for the year to March 31, Stoddard Sekers
International is cutting its total dividend from 2.625p to 1.5p.
Turnover of this manufacturer of carpets and furnishing fabrics rose from
Pounds 46m to Pounds 55.4m, reflecting the acquisition of BMK for a 10-month
period. On a comparable basis turnover fell 11 per cent, said Mr Hugh
Laughland, chairman.
Operating profits fell to Pounds 2.43m (Pounds 3.63m). On top of that
interest charges shot up to Pounds 920,000 (Pounds 369,000) arising from the
costs and debts assumed with the BMK purchase. That led to the decline in
pre-tax profit from Pounds 3.26m to Pounds 1.51m.
Earnings worked through at 1.6p (3.8p). The final dividend is cut from
1.875p to 0.75p.

FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: SelecTV growth held back by wrangling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SELECTV, producer of programmes such as Birds of a Feather and Lovejoy,
yesterday announced pre-tax profits nearly doubled to Pounds 809,000 in the
year to March, writes Raymond Snoddy.
Mr Allan McKeown, chief executive, expressed disappointment, however, that
the company had not broken the Pounds 1m barrier mainly because of the cost
of inter-company wrangling and legal fees.
A dispute between Mr Michael Buckley, the former chairman, and other
directors cost the company Pounds 295,000 in legal fees. Mr Tony Brooke, the
new chairman, said that following an investigation by Richards Butler, the
company solicitor, the board had concluded, 'that there had not been any
conduct amounting to a breach of fiduciary duty or other impropriety on the
part of Mr McKeown, who was completely exonerated by the board'.
Mr Buckley is no longer a director of the company.
Mr McKeown also yesterday discounted reports that Associated Newspapers,
which has increased its stake in SelecTV to 12 per cent, might be planning a
bid.
'I think it is very unlikely', said Mr Keown, who added that such a move
would breach rules on broadcasters not owning independent production
companies. Associated has a 20 per cent stake in Westcountry.
The pre-tax profit, achieved on turnover of Pounds 19.9m, compared with
Pounds 423,000 last time. Earnings per share rose from 0.38p to 0.42p.

<TEXT>
ROBERT FLEMING Holdings, the merchant bank and asset management company,
reported a 33 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 76.6m to Pounds
101.6m, in the year to March 31.
The privately owned company reported earnings per share of 142.6p (116.1p),
and proposed a final dividend of 26p, raising the total by 15 per cent to
38p.
'Excellent progress has been made in our investment banking, securities and
treasury operations,' said Mr Robin Fleming, chairman, in a statement to
shareholders.
The group's profile in corporate finance in the past year has been raised by
Fleming's role as global co-ordinator for the Pounds 2.3bn sale of Wellcome
shares by The Wellcome Trust.
In investment management, total assets under management rose by more than 20
per cent to Pounds 33.3bn with most growth stemming from international fund
management operations.
The group's Asian joint venture, Jardine Fleming, owned with Jardine
Matheson, achieved pre-tax profits of Dollars 93m (Pounds 62m), slightly
lower than the previous year.

FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Low take up for Blenheim cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Blenheim, the exhibition organiser, fell to a 16-month low after
the company announced a poor response to its Pounds 75.8m convertible
preference share issue, launched three weeks ago.
The company said that only about half the shares available had been taken up
by existing shareholders or placed firm, leaving the balance with
conditional placees. Under the structure of the issue, shares were
conditionally placed with investors but subject to clawback from ordinary
shareholders.
Excluding Compagnie Generale des Eaux, Blenheim's largest shareholder, only
20 per cent of existing shareholders had chosen to claw back shares from the
conditional placees.
Blenheim's shares fell 23p to 425p in light volume. The shares have now
fallen 22 per cent, from 542p, since the issue was announced.
The issue was unpopular with analysts who said Blenheim had no apparent need
for the money. They said the issue, combined with more planned acquisitions,
would further cloud Blenheim's underlying earnings, already under scrutiny
following a change in financial year end.
The take up rate compared unfavourably with a similar issue launched earlier
this year by Airtours, the holiday company. In that case, shareholders
clawed back 67.5 per cent of their entitlement.

Aviva Petroleum, the Texas-based oil and gas company with a London quote, is
seeking to raise a net Dollars 11.3m (Pounds 7.5m) in its second fund
raising in a year.
As part of a refinancing it has placed 12.6m shares at 95 cents (63p). The
shares were unchanged yesterday at 69p.
The refinancing is dependent on investors taking part being granted options
on a further 2m shares held by an existing shareholder.
Aviva raised Dollars 5.5m in a 60.65 per cent subscribed rights issue in
October last year. In April it announced increased pre-tax losses of Dollars
9.83m (Dollars 8.81m) for 1992.

FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Lucas on target with its divestment
programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXPERIMENT in glasnost by Lucas Industries, the engineering group, passed
off uneventfully yesterday.
Lucas told a party of 26 stockbroking analysts that the group's divestment
programme was on target to raise Pounds 75m within the current financial
year and that Lucas Acoustic Instruments had been added to the list of
disposal candidates.
Those were the principal pieces of new information to emerge from the visit,
during which Lucas executives were at pains to give a message of
'encouraging progress and no surprises'.
The shares closed unchanged at 136 1/2 p.
The company nevertheless put out a 700-word statement to the Stock Exchange
at 4pm yesterday, so as not to be accused of feeding analysts
price-sensitive information.
Last week the share price fell after analysts who attended a company dinner
at the Paris Air Show took away a bleak impression of current trading
conditions - particularly in the European brakes business.
Mr Bernard Carey, director of corporate communications, said the analysts
were told that Lucas did not want to take any questions on profit forecasts
or the dividend outlook.
The statement, said Mr John Grant, finance director, reported that although
markets were tough and Lucas had taken a prudent view for planning purposes,
most of the company's market segments were relatively strong.
Lucas had made useful gains in new business and market share throughout the
recession and cost reductions would more than offset falls in volume and
price pressures.

FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Construction loss leaves Shanks &amp; McEwan at
Pounds 10m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHANKS &amp; McEwan, the waste management company, yesterday reported a 62 per
cent fall in profits, as forewarned four weeks ago, after heavy losses in
its construction division.
Pre-tax profits for the year to end-March fell from Pounds 27.1m to Pounds
10.2m on turnover down 10 per cent at Pounds 131m.
Sales in the construction division fell Pounds 17m as a result of provisions
for late payment of contracts and payments it could not be sure of
collecting.
Mr Gordon Waddell, chairman, said the disappointing results masked a strong
performance in the core businesses. He recognised he would need to restore
the group's credibility which had been dented by the construction problems.
Earnings per share fell from 9.9p to 4.1p but the group is to recommend a
final dividend of 3.44p, holding the total at 5.68p.
The core waste management division increased turnover by 10 per cent to
Pounds 106.7m. Before exceptional items, pre-tax profits from waste
management activities increased from Pounds 25.7m to Pounds 26.3m.
Mr Waddell said the recession had lasted longer than anticipated and there
was no evidence of an upturn in the group's business.
Pre-tax profits from waste were unlikely to differ materially from last
year's level and the construction side was likely to incur losses in the
order of Pounds 3m.
Most of this represents the interest charge to fund contracts completed but
under dispute or not yet paid.
Shanks warned earlier this month it would be setting up a Pounds 19.3m
provision in the 1993 accounts to cover reorganisation of its construction
division encompassing late payments and sums relating to variations in
contracts that it is not certain it will collect.
Mr Waddell also said the group was 'disappointingly' still awaiting
implementation of waste management licensing under the Environmental
Protection Act 1990.
COMMENT
Shanks and McEwan has well and truly bitten the bullet on its construction
side, possibly even over-providing against non-payment of completed
contracts. Yesterday's figures threw up no new problem contracts but the
group will have a continuing, though reducing, interest charge as long as
payment is not made. Aside from this construction blot, Shanks has performed
commendably during a tough recession. The real question is when recovery is
going to creep beyond the consumer sector and into heavy industry and the
chemicals sector, on which it is so heavily dependent. The company is also
having to contend with an Environment Department apparently soft pedalling
on implementation of some of the legislation Shanks has been investing to
meet. It is not a happy time for waste companies. This year the company is
likely to make pre-tax profits of Pounds 26m, or earnings of 9.7p, giving a
prospective multiple of about 18.

FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Vibroplant confirms decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Vibroplant, the plant hire group with operations in the
UK and the US, fell from Pounds 4.51m to Pounds 1.9m in the year to March 31
1993 - as foreshadowed at the interim stage.
A reduced final dividend of 1.28p cuts the total to 2.5p (3.6p), covered by
earnings of 2.66p (6.55p) per share.
The shares were unchanged at 66p.
Mr Jeremy Pilkington, chairman, said the results in the UK had been affected
by Alphabet Event Hire, which was acquired in February 1992. It had been
expected to break even, but had run up 'a few thousand pounds' of losses.
More important, though, was the squeeze on prices throughout the whole UK
side. Volume and activity levels had been similar to the previous year, said
Mr Pilkington, but prices had been 'significantly and painfully cheaper'. UK
turnover fell to Pounds 34.9m (Pounds 37.9m), with profits at the operating
level at Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 4.83m) and at the pre-tax level Pounds 1.29m
(Pounds 3.27m).
In the US, where the group only hires out aerial work platforms and during
the year combined the various subsidiaries into one, the promised recovery
had not happened. Turnover there declined to Pounds 35m (Pounds 38.9m) and
pre-tax profits to Pounds 608,000 (Pounds 1.24m).
A bright spot was the group's strong cash flow which helped reduce gearing
to 50 per cent from the 90 per cent level of two years ago. Mr Pilkington's
short-term aim is for another Pounds 8m-Pounds 10m to be paid down this
year, bringing gearing down to the mid-30s.

FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: SW Electricity advances 22%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH WESTERN Electricity, the power supplier and distributor, said
yesterday it had virtually ended the practice of disconnecting customers as
it revealed a pre-tax profit of Pounds 101.1m, up 22 per cent on the
previous Pounds 83m, and a 15 per cent dividend rise.
Mr John Seed, chief executive, said that last month the company disconnected
only one customer over bad debts.
The dividend rise, taking the total from 17.4p to 20p with a final of 14.1p,
was at the top of the range among regional electricity companies so far this
year. It was paid from earnings of 63.1p (50.6p).
The company is understood to have given its retail arm two years to perform
satisfactorily. Unless it does, it is thought the company will seek to sell
it, although Mr Seed would not confirm this.
In the year to March 31 1993, the retailing arm incurred losses of Pounds
1.9m, against Pounds 400,000. Mr Seed said it had been helped by the
integration of 23 stores in South Wales. He expected the division, to at
least break even this year.
In the core electricity businesses, the company achieved a 10 per cent
reduction in controllable costs in two years. Staff had been reduced by that
proportion to 3,192.
The electricity business produced an operating profit of Pounds 103.9m, a
rise of Pounds 10.2m. The supply business gained 14 large industrial
customers outside the region in the competitive market to take its total to
17.
COMMENT
One effect of the disconnections progress was on bad debt provision, up from
Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 6.6m in the core business. But that should fall as
alternatives to controlling debt such as key budget meters take effect, and
the company's softer approach will please both customers and the regulator.
South Western's outstanding problem is retailing but that is par for the
course at electricity groups, and at least it seems to be ready to take
action if necessary. In the supply business, the company has less to lose
than most when the market opens up next year to allow competition between
companies for the custom of medium-sized industrial and commercial
customers. Only 13 per cent of its customers are in that category whereas
the average is 22 per cent. Conversely, South Western is more exposed than
most to the rise in electricity prices which will result from the imposition
of VAT; it has proportionally more domestic customers than the average. With
profits of Pounds 115m and dividends of 22.5p in prospect for this year, the
shares are trading on a prospective yield of about 6.1 per cent, about
average and fair.

FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Eurotunnel may need to seek a further
Pounds 1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROTUNNEL may need to raise additional funds 'of under or around Pounds
1bn' to pay for the Channel tunnel with an equity issue a possibility in the
first half of next year, shareholders were told yesterday.
It had not been expected that the company would consider making a share
issue so close to opening of the tunnel.
The figure of Pounds 1bn was also marginally higher than some analysts had
expected, although the group insisted that its funding expectations had not
changed and that any numbers at this stage were only an estimate.
The group has previously raised Pounds 8.9bn, of which Pounds 1.6bn is
equity.
Mr Gerald Corbett, chief financial officer, told the annual meeting in
London that Eurotunnel's current facilities were likely to last 'to around
the middle of 1994 plus or minus a couple of months.'
He said that banks in discussions with Eurotunnel had agreed that the
opportunity should be seized if conditions in the first half of next year
were 'suitable for an early equity raising by way of a rights issue or
similar route.'
It had been accepted that it would be preferable if future funding involved
a '50:50 split between equity or equity type funding and additional debt.'
Any equity issue would be timed to be at or near the opening of the tunnel
for services. Contractors building in the tunnel have told Eurotunnel that
the project was unlikely to open before next summer unless an agreement
could be reached over their claims for additional payments.
Eurotunnel's bankers, which so far have agreed to lend the project Pounds
7.3bn, however, are working on the basis that a phased opening would take
place with the first services for heavy goods vehicles starting in February
and services for cars and coaches starting in April next year.
Mr Corbett said that the loss of potential revenue caused by delays, rather
than any further increase in construction costs, was causing the strain on
future funding needs. The cost of building the project, including lost
revenue since 1987, has risen from Pounds 4.8bn to approaching Pounds 10bn.
He estimated that additional finance required by the group 'should be under
or around Pounds 1bn of which more or less Pounds 600m will be needed during
1994 and 1995 with the balance to be in place by the beginning of 1996.'
Up to Pounds 200m of this might come from a free issue of warrants, on the
basis of one warrant for every share held.
These would allow shareholders to buy one new share for FFr28.25 or 335p for
every ten warrants acquired. These could be exercised in October 1995 or in
June next year if funds were required earlier.
Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's chief executive, told shareholders that it
would cost the group 15 times more if it accepted the contractors demands
than the revenue it would lose through late opening.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Lonrho rises 74% with the help of disposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO, the international trading conglomerate, yesterday reported a 74 per
cent increase in interim pre-tax profits after a series of disposals.
The profit figure rose from Pounds 50m to Pounds 87m as sales fell from
Pounds 1.96bn to Pounds 1.5bn in the six months to March. The shares gained
7 1/2 p to close at 121p.
Mr Paul Spicer, Lonrho deputy chairman, yesterday said Lonrho would be
focusing on four core businesses. Mr Dieter Bock, the German financier
appointed joint chief executive with Mr Tiny Rowland, believes Lonrho should
concentrate on three: hotels, mining and agriculture.
However, Mr Spicer said: 'There is a fourth dimension of other businesses,
such as textile manufacturing, which we have no intention of getting out of
or destroying.'
The group has still to appoint the non-executive directors which Mr Bock has
said are essential to build bridges with institutional shareholders.
Mr Spicer said: 'You cannot take non-executives off a shelf as if you were
in a supermarket. We have to find people who are not too busy and who are
willing to serve.'
The recent sale of Gewog, a German holding company, brought net borrowings
below Pounds 600m and gearing to 35 per cent. In the first half, net debt
fell from Pounds 849m to Pounds 731m. Net interest paid declined from Pounds
44m to Pounds 35m.
The sale of VAG, the UK importer of Volkswagen and Audi cars, realised
Pounds 124m and a rights issue brought in another Pounds 80m. Lonrho said
the underlying increase in borrowings was due to the pound's devaluation and
capital spending.
Operating profit from continuing operatings increased from Pounds 35m to
Pounds 43m.
In the UK, improvement at the Metropole Hotel Group, in which the Libyan
government-controlled Libyan Arab Finance Company has a one third stake,
helped the leisure division report pre-tax profits of Pounds 5m.
Mineral extraction and refining raised pre-tax profits to Pounds 16m;
general trade doubled to Pounds 6m; agriculture and motor distribution each
made Pounds 2m; manufacturing turned a loss into a Pounds 4m profit;
financial services broke even.
Earnings per share were 0.8p, against a loss of 2p. The interim dividend is
maintained at 2p.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Smith New Court issue welcomed as profits double
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUOYANT volume in the UK stock market helped boost Smith New Court's pre-tax
profits to Pounds 38.7m for the year to May 7, up 110 per cent on last year.
The enthusiasm generated by the UK securities house's record profits ensured
a warm welcome for its announcement of a Pounds 41.2m rights issue, its
first since 1985. The two-for-seven issue is priced at 210p per share.
Smith New Court's share price gained 35p to close at 285p yesterday.
Most of the company's profits were generated in the second half, after a
quiet period last summer cut profits to Pounds 6.7m for the six months to
October 30. Since then a series of profitable placements (bought deals
accounted for 6 per cent of gross revenues) and an upswing in UK and
overseas stock market volume have contributed to the strong performance.
'The markets have been kind to us,' admitted Mr Michael Marks, chief
executive, citing strong performance in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and
the US as well as the UK. Mr Marks said that commissions and corporate fees
accounted for just under 50 per cent of profits, with the rest still
provided by marketmaking activities. Following recent expansion in overseas
markets, the split between domestic and foreign business was also even, he
added.
The capital provided by the rights issue will fund further growth in the UK
and overseas in the existing businesses of marketmaking, agency broking and
corporate broking.
In addition to the rights issue, both the Rothschild Group and CMCO
(formerly Carl Marks &amp; Co) are reducing their holdings through a placement
of new ordinary shares and existing convertible preference shares with
institutional investors. Rothschild's holding of fully diluted capital will
fall from 38.7 per cent to 26.5 per cent as a result of these transactions.
The board is recommending a final dividend of 5p per ordinary share,
bringing the total dividend to 6p, up 33 per cent on the previous year.
The company's return on capital improved from 17 per cent last year to 28
per cent. Earnings per share, fully diluted, were 36.2p, an increase of 118
per cent over the previous year.

FT  25 JUN 93 / TSB shows turnround in bad debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB GROUP yesterday announced a modest rise in pre-tax profits in the first
half of its financial year, as recovery in the economy helped halve
provisions for bad and doubtful debts from the second half of 1992.
The bank's pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 80m in the six months to April 30,
against Pounds 77m in the first half of 1992.
The figure included a Pounds 44m restructuring charge as it reduced staff
numbers by 1,100 and cut operating costs.
The interim dividend was maintained at 3.15p in spite of a rise in earnings
per share to 3.1p, against 2.8p in the first half.
Sir Nicholas Goodison, chairman, said the board had delayed a decision on
whether to raise the dividend until the full year. 'We have a recovery in
the economy, but it is still somewhat fragile,' he said.
He predicted 'a significant decline' in full-year provisions because the
rise in the second half of last year was unlikely to recur. The sharp fall
in bad debt provisions to Pounds 205m, compared with the Pounds 432m charged
for the second half of 1992 indicates that UK banks are likely to start
displaying a recovery from the burden of bad debts in the interim results
declared over the next five weeks.
TSB cut its ratio of costs to income to 65.3 per cent against 71 per cent,
as operating costs fell 3 per cent to Pounds 635m (from Pounds 654m).
Mr Peter Ellwood, chief executive, said the bank was 'determined to keep the
pressure on costs'.
The bank said it was making progress in running down two loss-making arms:
its Mortgage Express centralised mortgage business; and the loan
administration unit which now holds a net Pounds 1.6bn of poor loans made in
the late 1980s.
A bad debt charge of Pounds 64m was made against loans in the loan
administration unit, against Pounds 40m. This means that the unit's book is
now 54 per cent provided against, with a written down value of Pounds 747m,
against Pounds 917m.
The Hill Samuel merchant bank, to which Pounds 500m of capital is allocated,
contributed Pounds 53m to group profit, against Pounds 30m.
Sir Nicholas said TSB would continue to improve the business but was
'fundamentally willing to accept' an offer to buy it.
The group's ratio of core tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets fell to 8.1
per cent, against 8.8 per cent. Net assets per share fell to 109p, against
114p, and shares closed 3.5p down at 194p.

FT  25 JUN 93 / SocGen and BNP hit by Ferruzzi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOCIETE GENERALE and Banque Nationale de Paris are two of the foreign banks
most heavily exposed to Ferruzzi, the diversified Italian industrial group,
which owes foreign lenders about L6,500bn (Pounds 2.8bn).
French banks, which also include Credit Lyonnais, figure among the biggest
of Ferruzzi's foreign creditors because of loans to Eridania Beghin-Say, the
group's Paris-based agro-industrial business.
EBS had net debts of FFr14bn (Pounds 1.67bn) at the end of last year, while
the ratio of its net debts to equity was 88 per cent. Some French banks also
lent directly to the Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company.
Details of the group's bank credits remain secret. The local heads of both
French banks were in discussions, believed to be about the Ferruzzi crisis.
The talks on Ferruzzi's borrowings came amid signs of a rapprochement
between the group's five main Italian creditor banks, handling the
restructuring, and leading foreign lenders. Mr Guido Rosa, the local head of
Societe Generale, who is also chairman of the foreign banks' association in
Italy, is expected to be one of possibly two foreign bankers who may be
co-opted on to the five-bank committee.
Separately, further details have emerged about the Italian banks' exposure.
Banca Commerciale Italiana, one of the members of the five-bank committee,
is thought to have lent about L1,000bn, while Banca Nazionale del Lavoro,
the big treasury-owned bank, which is not on the committee, is thought to
have lent slightly less.
Attempts to uncover the extent of banks' exposure have been accompanied by
efforts by some creditor banks to distinguish between lending to Ferruzzi's
profitable operating subsidiaries, which have strong cash flows, and Ferfin.
The bulk of lending by Citibank is tied to the operating subsidiaries. Most
of the bank's positions in the syndicated loans it arranged were sold on to
other institutions. Citibank's overall exposure to the Ferruzzi group is now
more than L100bn.
Among other foreign banks believed to have lent heavily are Union Bank of
Switzerland and some big German banks.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Japan urged to cut trade surplus: Commission joins US in
calling for clear timetable from Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday joined the US in calling on Japan to set a
clear target and timetable for reducing its trade surplus which could reach
Dollars 150bn (Pounds 100bn) this year.
The Commission shared the US view that Japan's trade surplus as a proportion
of gross national product was so substantial that it was a destabilising
factor in world trade, Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external
economic affairs, said in Tokyo.
Sir Leon said: 'The EC, like the US, has a real problem with the Japanese
trade surplus. We would agree with the US that the percentage of GNP
represented by the trade surplus is excessive and should be reduced.'
The Japanese surplus is likely to reach about 3.5 per cent of Japanese gross
national product this year, largely because slow growth in Japan has
depressed demand for imports.
A senior US administration official said a cut to 1.5 per cent of GNP would
create more than 1m jobs elsewhere in the world economy. Hundreds of
thousands of the jobs would be in the US.
The official said the political turmoil in Japan after the government's
defeat in a no-confidence motion last Friday would not lead the US to back
off from its demands that the Japanese agree to measureable targets to
reduce the surplus.
He said: 'Continuity in our strategic and security relationship with Japan
requires discontinuity in our economic relations, with a fundamental change
in the way Japan relates to the world.'
The US and Japan will meet over the weekend to draw up a framework for talks
on issues such as access to the Japanese market and reduction of the surplus
over the next three years.
The EC wants the surplus reduced more quickly. Sir Leon said: 'We think it
is necessary to have some kind of yardstick that can be applied sooner than
three years.'
The administration official said recent pump-priming measures by the
Japanese government had only prevented a further tightening of fiscal policy
at a time when Japan and the world economy was already suffering from a
deficiency of domestic demand.
He denied the US was seeking managed trade agreements which would specify a
share of the Japanese market for foreign suppliers. Instead, he said, the US
would look at a range of measures such as the rate of growth of imports,
comparisons of foreign market share between Japan and other markets, the
representation of foreign interests on standard setting bodies and the scale
of foreign investment in manufacturing industry.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Kurds free Munich hostages after Turkish consulate siege

<TEXT>
KURDISH MILITANTS last night freed the final 10 hostages they were holding
at the Turkish consulate in Munich and surrendered, bringing to an end a day
of co-ordinated attacks on Turkish interests across western Europe.
Munich police said the gunmen - at least eight men - seized 21 hostages 12
hours earlier, then released 11, and threatened to burn the building if
police stormed it.
Bonn rejected their demand that Chancellor Helmut Kohl appear on TV and
'call on the Turkish government to stop the war against Kurdistan'.
The militants gave themselves up peacefully after hour-long negotiations
with Mr Bernd Schmidbauer, state secretary in the chancellery, and were
taken to a Munich police station.
The surrender marked the end of an unprecedented wave of attacks by Kurdish
militants across Europe.
In Berne, Switzerland, one demonstrator died and seven were wounded when
gunfire erupted among militants, police and Turkish embassy personnel, the
Swiss government said.
Switzerland threatened to ask the Turkish ambassador, Mr Kaya Toberi, to
surrender his diplomatic immunity if the embassy refused to help find out
who shot dead the demonstrator.
Small groups of militants wielding iron bars and axes also went on the
rampage in 20 German cities and towns - including Berlin, Hamburg, Hanover,
Dortmund, Bonn, Frankfurt and Stuttgart - breaking windows and furniture in
Turkish shops and banks. The North Rhine-Westphalia police said they had
arrested 28 militants.
In London, police arrested 24 who forced their way into a Turkish bank
through a fire escape. They were expected to be charged with criminal damage
and public order offences.
Turkish tourism offices, airlines and banks in Geneva, Zurich, Copenhagen,
Stockholm and Lyon were also attacked.
In Marseilles, Kurdish attackers released some 10 hostages at the Turkish
consulate unharmed and surrendered to police after a siege lasting nearly
three hours.
The attacks took place around 10am (8am GMT). Police said the degree of
co-ordination was unprecedented.
Reuters news agency reported that the Marxist Kurdistan Workers' party
(PKK), fighting a guerrilla campaign for a Kurdish state in south-east
Turkey, claimed responsibility for the attacks. However, police in Munich
said the gunmen denied acting as PKK agents.

FT  25 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Smith New Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Smith New Court has every right to be pleased with itself. A return on
capital of 28 per cent last year - due to an astonishing annualised rate of
return of 50 per cent in the second half - is twice that achieved by SG
Warburg across its investment banking interests. But Smith can no more
afford to rest on its laurels than others in the industry. ICI, for example,
is targeting an annual return on new investment of 20 per cent. Since the
securities business is more volatile than most industrial enterprises, the
return achieved by Smith last year is little more than the average investors
might expect through the economic cycle.
On that basis, Smith will have to work hard to justify yesterday's Pounds
41m rights issue. Strides which have been made to improving the quality of
earnings will help. More than half of last year's profits were earned
outside the UK. The steady increase in commission income has reduced its
dependence on market making, which feeds off the unpredictable level of
turnover in the UK stock market. Its reluctance to move into new areas such
as bonds or merchant banking is equally comforting. If that makes Smith a
less risky investment, investors will accept a lower return.
The 14 per cent rise in the shares yesterday suggests the market has
concluded that the outlook is both brighter and less changeable than it
previously forecast. In risk businesses such as market making and
underwriting, though, Smith will always be vulnerable to nasty shocks.

FT  25 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Tour operators
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market was clearly unnerved by the news of an Office of Fair
Trading investigation into the package holiday industry, knocking some 4 per
cent off the shares of both Airtours and Owners Abroad. The vertical
integration rapidly developing between tour operators and travel agents is
certainly worth investigation. The uncertainty is whether the outcome will
prove a damp squib or a regulatory Catherine wheel.
Under the terms of the Fair Trading Act, the competition authorities could
recommend any number of measures, such as divestment of travel agencies,
transparency of treatment for independent operators, or pre-notification of
further acquisitions. Moreover, considerations affecting consumer interest
and market structure are likely to prevail over parity of treatment. This
could, for example, theoretically result in Airtours being forced to divest
recently-acquired agencies leaving Thomson's long-established link with Lunn
Poly intact.
But although the OFT may be in earnest, there is little evidence the DTI
will be similarly minded. Mr Michael Heseltine's brusque dismissal of the
OFT's recommendations at the time of the Airtours bid for Owners Abroad
suggests the DTI may take some persuading of the case for intervention. This
may be especially true given the embarrassing mess it caused in the brewing
industry through the implementation of its beer orders. But until such
uncertainties are resolved, the quoted tour operators will remain under a
cloud, no matter how many tourists they whisk away to sunny beaches.

FT  25 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Lonrho
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lonrho's unstinting commitment to glasnost was underlined by the absence of
the joint chief executive as the company announced its interim results
yesterday. Doubtless, Mr Dieter Bock had long-standing business in Germany,
but it is surely not beyond the wit of Lonrho to produce its figures and its
leading lights at the same time.
Nor do the results themselves give great confidence that things have
changed. Most of the jump in profits came from the disposal of VAG, the UK
Volkswagen distributor, rather than continuing operations. While the market
took comfort from the company's Pounds 118m fall in net debt, that comes
only after inflows from the rights issue and the VAG sale. Exceptional items
apart, cash is still flowing out of the business. Lonrho's continuing
businesses may only generate 4p of earnings this year, leaving the shares at
a 50 per cent premium to the market. This valuation of the company as a
sure-fire recovery prospect is optimistic. Neither mining nor hotels are
likely to produce radically improved profits in the near future.
Other hopes rest on Mr Bock's as yet unexplained strategy for Lonrho. But
even if he is able to identify avenues for expansion, it is not at all clear
how they might be financed. More debt is hardly an option and disposals will
not provide enough cash for substantial investment. Appetite for further
rights issues or paper-funded acquisitions may be limited, at least until
there is clear evidence that the African leopard has finally changed its
spots.

FT  25 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: TSB's capital question
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After all the losses it has piled up as a result of its purchase of Hill
Samuel and ill-judged forays into commercial lending, it is astonishing that
TSB still has a tier one capital ratio as high as 8.1 per cent. Now that
provisions appear to be on a falling trend, surplus capital could become
something of a burden. The risk that the bank will again find something
stupid on which to fritter away its cash is small. The new management
brought in to sort out the mess left by Hill Samuel will not want to suffer
the same fate as its predecessors. But TSB's chosen specialisations require
relatively little capital. That applies not only to insurance, but also to
mortgage lending, which requires only half the capital backing of ordinary
commercial credit business.
In terms of operating profit, TSB's strategy may pay off only slowly. The
bank has no alternative but to bid up for retail deposits as it cannot
expect to retain the low-cost funds on which it depended in
pre-privatisation days. The 80 per cent jump in insurance income during the
first half will not necessarily be repeated. Part of it reflected the
buoyancy of the stock market and part the first significant contribution
from general insurance. Nor will costs necessarily continue to fall. But
unlike other banks whose capital ratios have suffered from the recession,
TSB will not need large retentions from earnings to finance growth in the
recovery. Its ability to increase its dividends should be correspondingly
greater.

<TEXT>
Henry Ford the First's aversion to borrowing from banks has infected
flamboyant Frenchman Hubert Perrodo, majority owner of oil explorer Kelt
Energy. One clash too many with Britain's financial community has resolved
him to shun bank finance even if it slows up his ambitious plans for the
company.
After the disastrous takeover two years ago of another oil company, Carless,
he was forced to hand over most of Kelt's exploration assets to a group of
banks in return for writing off its debts. Now he vows he'd rather miss a
deal than go back to the banks.
'The problem with them is that they aren't on the same wavelength as us.
It's not their fault, but they want a pay-back within two or three years and
I can't get oil out of the ground before five.'
Perrodo, who as chairman of Kelt draws no salary, says he still has Dollars
60m in the bank from the sale of a drilling company. Kelt has just agreed a
deal with Scottish Power for the electricity company to finance the
development of a Kelt gas find which will then fuel a power station.
'We could have financed that ourselves if we'd gone to the bank, but no way]
I'd rather take less of the production and let someone else deal with the
banks.'

Poor John Ashworth, director of the London School of Economics, whose
entrepreneurial approach to academia much impressed Mrs Thatcher. First he
lost the battle to take over County Hall as a new seat for the LSE. Now his
plan to charge undergraduates up to Pounds 1,000 to compensate for cuts in
government funds has been thrown out by the LSE academic board.
It leaves a big hole in the LSE budget, which will not be bridged by plans
to raise fees for post-graduate students. That plan has been put on the back
burner because of fears overseas students on masters' courses might kick up
a fuss if they felt their higher fees were subsidising British
undergraduates. The net result could be to put paid to the LSE's aspirations
to become a world-class postgraduate university.
Many of the dons who voted down the fee plan by 75 votes to 9 felt their
director had tried to use the issue to start a national debate on higher
education funding. Ashworth, away on a pre-arranged visit to Taiwan,
desperately needs a victory soon if he is to sustain his authority at the
school.

Brief as his experience as Northern Ireland minister may have been, Mates

FT  25 JUN 93 / A rounded bloke at the Treasury: Kenneth Clarke outlines his
views on taxes, the economy and the pound to Philip Stephens and Peter
Norman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEVENS and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interviewing Mr Kenneth Clarke is a disarming experience. Chancellors tend
to be cryptic and evasive. Their most characteristic skills are caution and
a capacity to sidestep awkward questions. Pressed on interest rates, tax
policy or the value of the pound, they frustrate their inquisitors with a
frozen smile or an infuriating shrug.
Mr Clarke is not like that. The 52-year-old scion of the industrial Midlands
has built his political career on a bluntness born of abundant
self-confidence. He prefers to say what he thinks rather than worry about
how others might interpret it. He has a habit - rare in politics these days
 -of saying the same in public as in private.
His approach has brought grief during spells running most of Whitehall's big
departments. At Westminster the Tory right wing still seethes over his
decision in November 1990 to tell the wounded Mrs Margaret Thatcher he would
resign unless she stood down.
But the ups have far outweighed the downs. Mr Clarke now holds the second
most powerful office in the land. He might yet realise his ambition to
become prime minister. He does not intend to be cowed by the financial
markets into Delphic obfuscation.
In a hour-long discussion, he spelled out:
why he might be forced to raise taxes in his November Budget.
his intention to accelerate the reduction of the government's Pounds 50bn
borrowing requirement.
why he had not cut interest rates; and
how his preference for a managed exchange rate would influence policy
towards sterling.
He said he wanted to change the culture of the Treasury and explained why he
intended to 'sit on the fence' in the debate over independence for the Bank
of England.
But above all, Mr Clarke explained the politics which drives his economics:
why he had changed the rhetoric of policy making. His starting point was
simple. It became a recurring theme. He had no intention of being mesmerised
by the Treasury's monetary's motorways or the preoccupations of City
scribblers. They were important, but: 'The Chancellor of the Exchequer is
essentially a political post.'
From that perception flowed the central ambition of his chancellorship: 'I
regard the whole object of economic policy as making it easier for the wider
world, particularly the business community, to deliver greater wealth, more
employment and so on.'
Mr Clarke paused, perhaps in case the mandarins took fright. He was not
abandoning the strategy of his luckless predecessor, Mr Norman Lamont. He
was as committed as anyone to sustaining low inflation. He was pledged also
to his 'obvious, screaming, day-to-day task' of tackling the deficit: 'Not
just talking about it - but taking necessary action to get it down.'
But the Treasury had other roles. It should be constructive, instead of
simply 'spending its whole life saving money'. Above all, Mr Clarke wanted
to 'relate all we do to the real economy, to commerce, business, creation of
wealth, creation of jobs'.
But how confident was he that Mr Lamont's green shoots are now firmly
rooted? Was the present inflation rate of 1.3 per cent - the lowest for
nearly 30 years - one of those infamous 'blips'?
There was a note of caution. He had been restrained in his claims about the
economic upturn.
But then: 'I think the recovery is steady, I mean it's not so patchy as it
was. The news has all been consistent for some time now. There was evidence
of a fallback in one or two areas in April but nothing to disturb the
underlying trend. We do appear to have a recovery. It's not very strong, but
it looks like it's going to be sustained.'
He would not offer a personal forecast. But there was a hint that growth
might outpace the predictions set out in Mr Lamont's March Budget: 'In so
far as people are revising their forecasts for the growth of the UK economy
they tend to be revising them upwards . . . I take comfort from that.'
Mr Clarke appeared sanguine about prices: 'As far as inflation is concerned
there are no signs of any inflationary pressures of any kind coming through
in any of the data that I have.'
Not that he was complacent: past devaluations had too easily translated into
higher prices. But 'we have a refreshingly low level of pay settlements, a
reasonably low level of inflationary expectations so far. Therefore on that
front I am reasonably relaxed.'
But on one subject Mr Clarke had no cause for optimism. A Pounds 1bn-a-week
borrowing requirement is unsustainable. He knows it. So he first protested
that: 'From the word go I have been saying . . . recovery in itself is not
going to solve the problem of the public finances.'
Nor did he take much comfort from Mr Major's oft-repeated assertion, blaming
70 per cent of the deficit on the recession. It was a 'guesstimate'. What
matters more 'is how much of the deficit will be reduced by recovery if we
can sustain it'.
Then came a significant policy announcement - the sort you would expect in
an important set-piece speech to the City rather than in a interview. Mr
Clarke declared that the medium-term profile for the borrowing requirement
set out by Mr Lamont - reducing it to 4 per cent of gross domestic product
by 1996-97 - was not good enough.
'Where we stand at the moment, the situation appears to be: that on this
year's (March) Budget, on this year's public spending remit, on the current
forecast of growth, the forecast I have indicates that the deficit is too
high.' Mr Clarke intended to accelerate the pace of reduction.
There are only three ways he can achieve his ambition. By cutting spending
further, by raising taxes or by securing faster economic growth. The
chancellor ruled out the first. He does not intend to reduce public spending
below the ceilings agreed recently by the cabinet - they were tough but
realistic.
So either the economy has to grow faster than predicted or Mr Clarke has to
add more tax increases to those already in place. He agreed that was what he
meant.
'The stronger or more sustained growth becomes, the less likely I am to look
at the tax side of the account. If growth shows signs of faltering or
weakening the more likely I am to look for revenue. Its about as Delphic as
I can put it.'
There were caveats here. The chancellor interjected that his judgment was
based on present forecasts for growth. His answers betrayed a hope that,
come November, he will be able to be more optimistic.
He would probably make his final judgment three or four weeks before the
Budget: 'Then I'll be able to see where we are in anticipating growth, where
we are on the public sector borrowing requirement, forecasts of it, and take
a judgment about whether we need some revenue to help speed up tackling the
deficit.'
He was not enthusiastic about the idea of raising taxes. His own instincts
were to cut them. But he had to face up to reality.
But why had he not demanded deeper cuts in public spending? Three reasons.
The existing ceilings were much tougher than generally realised. Spending
was now set to grow by far less than GDP. He also wanted a settlement that
was deliverable - not a short-term fix which would quickly unravel.
Third, Mr Clarke made clear he believes in public spending. Its purpose is
not simply to buy votes: 'The reason for going for public expenditure is
because you are committed to certain public programmes which you are bound
to deliver. And the objective of the government is to deliver what it said
it was going to deliver in a cost-effective way within whatever you judge
the country can afford.'
Then came a sideswipe: 'If you just look at the financial pages, I sometimes
think public spending remits are regarded as a test of the government's
machismo. This is fine for some bloke who spends his entire life writing -
with the greatest respect - for financial readers. It is no way to run a
democratic state.'
So what taxes would be raised if needs be? There were one or two clues to
what he probably would not do. Mr Lamont had hinted he might raise corporate
taxes.
This seemed to be 'uncharacteristic kite-flying'. Mr Clarke went back to the
strength of the recovery. 'If we don't have a very strong recovery . . . I
don't begin by looking at raising extra taxation from the corporate sector.'
He was more equivocal about whittling away mortgage interest relief. A quick
dismantling looks unlikely. 'I've no doubt it's something I shall look at in
due course, but the idea that it's an easy thing just get rid of it . . .
just seems to be currently flavour of the month.'
It was time to talk about the exchange rate. Mr Clarke accepts that Britain
is unlikely to return to the European exchange rate mechanism this side of
the next general election but made no secret still of his preference for a
managed, stable pound. So does he intend, like Mr Nigel Lawson, to shadow
the D-Mark?
'Straight answer - no. Nigel's experience of shadowing the D-Mark, whilst
noble at the time, I think he would accept, did not succeed.' He does not
think the exchange rate is 'one of those things that can just be left to
find its own level'. But 'for every conceivable reason we are not going to
be in the fixed rate exchange rate system for some years to come, and I
think therefore it's a mistake to somehow shadow some currency in the ERM or
try to allow the exchange rate to dominate policy compared with all other
indicators once you're outside'.
He added: 'I'm not sitting here at the moment thinking I want to see the
pound stronger against the DM or I want to see the pound weaker against the
DM, I'm not sitting here saying that.'
The discussion moved on to the idea of an independent Bank of England. Two
out of the last three chancellors have made public pleas for day-to-day
control of monetary policy to be passed to the Bank.
Mr Clarke said he would listen carefully to the debate - 'Yes, I'm sitting
on the fence' - before making up his mind. But 'there's nothing that's going
to happen in a hurry on the central bank front'.
More important than the institutional arrangements was the need to ensure
that the right decisions were made over interest rates: 'It doesn't matter
who the hell takes the decision,' he said.
So what about interest rates - why has he not given a further boost to
economic activity by lowering borrowing costs. He sees no reason to do so:
'I haven't cut interest rates because I don't think the indicators we use
would suggest that we should. I certainly would not just cut interest rates
to go for a quick kick-start to the recovery, because I think that would
have inflationary implications and I am determined to keep to low
inflation.'
The trade deficit - at present running at between Pounds 15bn and Pounds
20bn a year - troubles Mr Clarke. He did not think there would be any
problem in financing it. 'What concerns me about it, obviously, is what it
tells us about competitiveness. I think it shows we have to do a lot more on
the supply side of the economy.'
The interview has been running for an hour. Mr Clarke has not paused once to
consult his papers or check his figures with the attendant Treasury
official. There is time (but not space in this account) for him to reiterate
his instinctive pro-Europeanism and for him to return to the theme that
industry and industrialists count.
But the abiding impression that Mr Clarke leaves is of his determination to
broaden the Treasury's role - to return it to the real world. It needs to be
more constructive and positive in setting the government's priorities.
'Candle-ends matter but guys here are too bright as to bother all the time
about candle-ends.'
