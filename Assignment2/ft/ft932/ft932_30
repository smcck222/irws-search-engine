FT  11 MAY 93 / French companies given budget boost

THE first budget of France's new centre-right government includes proposals
to invest FFr2.65bn (Pounds 310m) in public works this year in an attempt to
create jobs and to bolster the troubled construction industry.
The public works package, most of which will be spent on new roads, was one
of a series of measures intended to haul the French economy out of recession
and to alleviate the pressure on particularly vulnerable sectors, notably
the building industry and small companies.
The small company proposals, worth FFr1.6bn overall, include government
provision of FFr400m to help businesses in difficulty and an injection of
FFr300m into Sofaris, a special fund that guarantees loans to small
concerns.
Other proposals will make it easier and cheaper to transfer the ownership of
companies, particularly private businesses, through the provision of tax
breaks worth FFr410m in a full year.
The state will also contribute FFr46m to encourage small businesses to
relocate outside the Paris area.
Small companies should benefit from the proposed changes to the value added
tax system. The government is abolishing the month-long delay between
companies paying VAT and receiving their refunds. This should yield savings
of FFr11bn for the corporate sector, with FFr5.5bn going to small companies.
The prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, also took steps to boost investment
in the run-up to his government's privatisation programme. It is expected to
start in September and will involve the sale of several state-controlled
financial and industrial groups.
The government is waiving the tax payable on cash switched from money market
funds into equity savings plans, in an attempt to encourage long-term
investment in shares. Further it is exempting investors from paying bourse
tax on the first FFr150 of each share deal to try to encourage small
investors.

AGREEMENT on a European strategy for the development of advanced wide-screen
television was still blocked last night by a dispute over funding between
Britain and its 11 EC partners.
But British officials said telecoms ministers were closer than ever before
to a deal on advanced television, based on a compromise tabled by the Danish
presidency of the Community.
Earlier, Mr Edward Leigh, the British telecoms minister, indicated that the
UK was not prepared to back a funding plan which would cost the Community
more than Ecu150m (Pounds 118.5m) between now and 1998.
The UK's EC partners welcomed this as the first sign that Britain, which has
been blocking a deal for 18 months, was prepared to allow any Community
funding for such a plan. But most member states believe at least Ecu200m is
necessary to kick-start what they hope will be a lucrative market for
wide-screen, cinema-quality television in Europe.
Failure would not necessarily lead to the disintegration of the Commission's
seven-year-old ambition to back European advanced television against US and
Japanese competition. Discussion would almost certainly resume on June 16 at
a special meeting of telecoms ministers in Luxembourg.
Under the Danish plan, the Community would match funds put up by
programme-makers and broadcasters wishing to develop programmes in the new
wide-screen format. Some of the total EC funding would be held in reserve to
back projects submitted later by countries with less well-developed
audio-visual industries.

<TEXT>
EC telecommunications ministers yesterday laid the foundations for opening
ordinary telephone calls to competition by January 1 1998.
Ministers voiced their general support for the 1998 deadline for
liberalisation of domestic and international telephone calls, as laid out in
European Commission proposals published last month. But there was less
enthusiasm for the possibility of allowing rival networks to compete by
exploiting existing infrastructure or building new networks.
The ministers also reached agreement on a technical directive which will
harmonise conditions for companies which want to use telecoms networks to
provide voice services and lay out users' rights of access. The directive on
so-called 'open network provision' (ONP) for voice telephony is a
prerequisite for further liberalisation of telephone calls.
On the wider liberalisation proposals, a number of member states - Greece,
Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Ireland - said they would need more than five
years to improve their own networks.
The Commission has suggested that countries with particular difficulties
could be granted a two-year extension of the deadline.
The speed of liberalisation will be the main battleground when ministers
begin in-depth discussions on the timetable at their next scheduled meeting
on June 16.
Britain, which wants swift liberalisation, said slow progress would hamper
European industry.
'The date of 1998 is already too long and certainly anything beyond that is
out of the question,' said one UK official yesterday.
However, Britain welcomed the more flexible attitude of the new French
coalition government.
Paris has now given broad backing to the Commission's proposals, while
calling for the Community to create favourable conditions for private
innovation in the sector.

FT  11 MAY 93 / KIO's Spanish collapse becomes top election issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLLAPSE last year of the Dollars 5bn investment in Spain by the Kuwait
Investment Office (KIO) has taken centre stage in Spanish politics ahead of
next month's election. The opposition is calling for legal action against
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and members of the government for failing to
supervise Kuwaiti activities in Spain.
The issue threatens to reignite a row over Madrid's responsibility in the
collapse of the KIO's Spanish empire, which may yet destroy the country's
biggest fertiliser, chemicals and foods companies, with a potential loss of
30,000 jobs.
Unions and opposition politicians said last year that the government had
been negligent in allowing the Kuwaiti government's foreign investment arm
into Spain without scrutinising each of its investment proposals in cabinet
first.
The government has replied that it did not know that the companies through
which the KIO was investing in Spain were controlled by the state of Kuwait.
But, according to a report released yesterday by the conservative opposition
party, the Partido Popular (PP), which some opinion polls put slightly ahead
of Mr Gonzalez' socialists, the government has been lying.
'The KIO is and always has been a part of the State of Kuwait,' said Mr
Francisco Alvarez-Cascos, secretary general of the PP.
That is well known but the government has so far managed to confuse critics
by saying it never knew enough about the KIO.
Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister, said earlier this year he had
always thought the KIO investments were private.
Under Spanish law, investments by a sovereign state require cabinet scrutiny
and approval. In the case of the KIO, the Kuwaitis moved billions of dollars
in profit and investment into and out of Spain between 1986 and 1992, it
seems, without the cabinet ever being asked to see one piece of paper.
Yesterday Mr Alvarez-Cascos produced a letter, written in June 1988 by Mr
Manuel Conthe, then director general of external transactions in the Finance
Ministry and since promoted to head of the Spanish Treasury, which strongly
contradicts the government's current position.
Addressing himself to the secretary of state for commerce and the finance
minister's chef de cabinet, Mr Conthe said the 'investments by the KIO in
Spain fall fully within (the law) requiring their prior authorisation by the
cabinet. Given that until today. . . these investments have been treated as
private, there exists a clear divergence between the law and the reality.'
While the PP report does little more than confirm that the government knew
what everyone else knew, and while its timing is clearly electoral, the
letter will add to the widespread impression in Spain that the government
has not been rigorous with the law.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Still not ready to take the credit for reform: How big
subsidies continue to cripple Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON and EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN two weeks after President Boris Yeltsin's referendum victory, the
prospects for Russia's economic reforms seem as precarious as ever. While
the reformers struggle to retain influence within the government, the
Russian central bank is again in the firing line for lax credit policies
which are expected to fuel an acceleration in inflation over the next few
months.
The reformers have tried to pin the blame for inflation on Mr Viktor
Gerashchenko, the central bank governor, who has been publicly portrayed by
both the president and radical ministers as an enemy from within who is
recklessly flooding the economy with inflationary credit.
'The reformists are still engaged in a battle with the central bank for
tighter credit,' former prime minister Yegor Gaidar said in London last
week.
Moscow abounds with rumours of Mr Gerashchenko's imminent replacement. One
scenario now being rehearsed by radicals is for Mr Boris Fyodorov, the
finance minister, to take over the central bank governor's job. This might
be accompanied by the return to the finance ministry of Mr Gaidar, although
he has denied that he has received any such invitation.
The central bank has reacted angrily to these rumours. 'To me it is plain
silly to blame the central bank,' says Mr Alexander Khandruyev, a deputy
governor at the central bank. 'It is very hard for the bank to implement a
tough monetary policy if the government keeps increasing state credits to
regions and enterprises.'
Mr Sergie Vassiliev, director of the government's Centre for Economic
Reform, confirms that government demands for credits from the central bank
have increased in recent weeks. 'Thirty per cent monthly inflation reflects
the government's inability to control its expenditures,' he says. 'If Mr
Gerashchenko is to blame, it is because he should be saying No to government
requests for credits.'
Even Mr Fyodorov has found it difficult to practise the financial orthodoxy
he has preached to the central bank. Having pushed the central bank to
increase interest rates, he has failed to wean the finance ministry off the
special low interest rates it continues to pay on central bank credit to
finance the budget deficit.
At the root of the inflation problem are subsidies that the Russian state is
still paying to the enterprise sector. Experts at western financial
institutions estimate that explicit budget subsidies were equivalent to a
little over 20 per cent of gross domestic product last year, mainly to
enterprises. But the same amount again was paid to enterprises through
off-budget credits from the central bank and the ministry of finance.
Recent monetary data had been relatively encouraging, with the monthly
inflation rate falling to 21 per cent in March from 26 per cent in February
and the growth of central bank credit dropping into single figures. But a
rise in government spending and bank credits in the weeks preceding the
referendum are expected to cause inflation to accelerate back towards 30 per
cent over the next few months.
A rise in the monthly credit emissions and inflation could not come at a
worse time for Russia's reformers, who are negotiating a tough credit stance
with officials from the International Monetary Fund in order that promised
western aid can be released as early as the end of this month.
Senior officials from the group of seven industrialised countries say they
will require evidence that credit emissions are being controlled and
subsidies are being cut before they will release the promised western aid.
But G7 officials, desperately searching for signs that President Yeltsin is
using the referendum result to press ahead with reforms, have so far been
disappointed. Instead, President Yeltsin has appeared to dilute the
government's radical content by appointing two first deputy prime ministers
without radical credentials, which has tilted the balance in the cabinet in
favour of the conservatives.
An increasingly gloomy Mr Fyodorov wrote last Friday in the newspaper
Izvestia that the two weeks since the referendum endorsed radical economic
reforms had been wasted. The government was taking no action to close ailing
state-owned enterprises while the central bank was continuing to supply the
credit to keep them going.
'For instance, the level of subsidies to the coal industry are at least two
trillion roubles,' Mr Fyodorov wrote. 'At the same time everybody recognises
the need to close down dozens of inefficient coal mines but nobody is doing
anything about it. Is there any country in the world where coal subsidies
account for 20 per cent of budget revenues?'
Neither side is blameless. Both the central bank and the government find it
much easier to accuse each other than face up to the monumental difficulties
involved in bringing inflation under control.
'It is very dangerous to make the central bank a scapegoat,' says Mr
Khandruyev. 'The central bank should be organising a payments system,
stabilising the rouble and managing a tight monetary policy, not be dragged
into political confrontation,' he says.
'You can replace Mr Gerashchenko but what will happen tomorrow? Somebody has
got to take the burden of responsibility on their shoulders.'

FT  11 MAY 93 / Balladur lightens welfare burden on payrolls: A plan aimed
at easing pressure on employers to shed jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIME Minister Edouard Balladur yesterday took a couple of steps towards
financing more of the French welfare state out of general taxation and less
out of the payroll contributions that help generate France's chronically
high unemployment
His two main proposals here are an increase from 1.1 to 2.4 per cent in the
so-called generalised social contribution (CSG) - a kind of income tax whose
proceeds go to funding social security - and a shift in some of the 'social'
payroll contributions, which employers have to make for their lower-paid
workers, to the charge of the state. This shift will only involve some
FFr8bn (Pounds 960m) this year, but eventually Mr Balladur hopes to transfer
the cost of all family allowances, running at nearly FFr200bn a year, off
the backs of employers and onto that of the state budget.
The problem which Mr Balladur is tackling is that France puts more of the
burden of its welfare system on its active workforce than any other EC
country. Social security contributions by employers/employees accounted for
44.2 per cent of tax receipts in France in 1990, compared with a Community
average of 28.4 per cent, 17.5 per cent in Britain and only 3.1 per cent in
Denmark (which has the opposite bias, loading virtually all welfare costs
onto general taxation).
This has given French employers a particular financial incentive to shed
labour, so that more than 3m are now out of a job. The more people drop out
of the active workforce, the fewer are left to finance the welfare system on
which correspondingly greater demands are made in a time of high
unemployment (hence, the deficits shown in the accompanying table).
But Mr Balladur's reforms do not go very far, though he has proposed setting
up a 'solidarity fund' to cover the accumulated social security debt, which
a government-ordered audit last week forecast - without yesterday's
corrective measures - would rise to nearly FFr135bn by the end of this year.
Increasing the CSG is a very useful of righting the imbalance in welfare
funding. It bears not only on salaries, but also on unearned income such as
dividends, and is therefore more 'progressive' than social security
contributions. But it was introduced in 1990 by the Socialists, and as such
is strongly disliked by Mr Balladur's conservative coalition. As a sop to
his supporters, Mr Balladur is proposing that the extra 1.3 per cent in CSG
payments should be deductible from individuals' income tax.
This will only add to the many deductions which French taxpayers can take.
According to Banque Indosuez, only half of French households pay income tax
at all, compared with three quarters in most other industrialised countries.
For those who do pay something to the fisc (tax office), deductions allow
them to take an average of half their disposable income out of their taxable
income. Mr Balladur was himself responsible for narrowing the income tax
base when he was finance minister in 1986-88. Now heading a government which
came to power promising to put more into people's pockets than it takes out,
he did nothing yesterday to remedy his earlier acts.
But he is looking to the redoubtable Mrs Simone Veil, the ministerial
overlord for social services, to find up to FFr25bn savings a year in the
French health system, Europe's most generous. According to OECD figures,
France spends an average FFr10,000 keeping each of its citizens healthy.
Mr Balladur is proposing that the French should work a bit longer for a
slightly less generous pension. At present, the French qualify for a full
pension after 37.5 years of work; this threshold would be raised gradually
to 40 years. At the moment, pension levels are based on the average of a
workers' 10 best-paid years; the level will now be calculated over a 25-year
period.
But France still faces the problem that, along only with Italy inside the
EC, its pension system is still run hand-to-mouth, with contributions coming
in from the employed forming the sole source of money being paid out to the
retired. Unlike the other 10 EC states, France does not yet have a system of
private pension funds, invested in the stock market and providing a
supplement to the state scheme.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Pound falls on rate cut speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING slipped sharply against both the D-Mark and the dollar yesterday as
dealers took the view that the UK government might cut base rates again to
try to improve its political fortunes.
In London the pound closed 3 pfennigs down on the day at DM2.4625 and 4
cents lower at Dollars 1.535, and was at roughly the same level by the close
of New York trading.
Sterling was also a full percentage point below its Friday close when
measured against its exchange rate index, which tracks sterling's value
against a basket of currencies. It closed last night at 79.9.
Speculation that the UK might again ease monetary policy, thus stimulating
the economy, helped the FT-SE 100 index of leading industrial shares to rise
36 points to close at 2,829.7.
Economic data on consumer credit and producer prices also raised hopes for
inflation-free expansion in the UK economy. On the money markets, there was
mild speculation that base rates could be cut by the autumn. Three-month
sterling cash closed at 5 7/8 per cent from a previous close of 5 15/16 per
cent.

FT  11 MAY 93 / EBRD committee proposes sweeping inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HELLIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMITTEE which will look into allegations of overspending at the
European Bank of Reconstruction and Development wants a sweeping inquiry
which would examine most aspects of the bank's spending policies, including
'special flight arrangements'.
The audit committee, which includes EBRD directors, has recommended that
four firms of auditors be asked to tender for the role of adviser. The
bank's own external auditors, Deloitte Touche and Tohmatsu, would not be
among them.
The proposed terms of reference, which were put to a meeting of the EBRD's
board of directors yesterday, are rigorous. They include suggesting that
there should be what is described as an 'arms length' relationship with the
bank's management during the inquiry, given the sensitivity of the
committee's work. This, says the document setting out the proposals,
requires 'strict adherence to confidentiality and independence'.
Mr Claes de Neergaard, chairman of the audit committee, has said that, in
addition to external auditors, outside quantity surveyors and architects
should be appointed 'to ensure the appearance of absolute independence and
objectivity'.
The committee, which was charged by EBRD directors on April 19 with carrying
out the inquiry, has asked for between Pounds 200,000 and Pounds 300,000 for
the task. It plans to deliver its report by July 15 although there is scope
for it to take longer.
The bank yesterday declined to comment on the audit committee's proposals.
However Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's founder and president, is understood
to have told the board that the audit committee will get all the support it
needs.
Mr Attali is also believed to have accepted that the committee should look
at the bank's use of private jets. The inquiry was set up after widespread
calls from the bank's international shareholders following revelations in
the Financial Times of expenditure of Pounds 55.5m by the bank on its London
headquarters.
The committee's remit on expenses at the EBRD's headquarters will include,
but not be limited to, a review of:
The adequacy of the procedures for tendering and procurement to ensure that
services and goods were processed and payments were made in a regular and
proper fashion so as to obtain proper value for money.
The cost effectiveness of the specification for the project. The adequacy of
the arrangements for reporting progress on the project to the directors.
The adequacy of the arrangements for managing the project, within the bank
and between the main contracting parties, taking account of best practice in
the European Community.
The bank's policy and procedures with respect to fitting out the temporary
headquarters at Leadenhall Street.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Major considers summer reshuffle to lift party morale:
Government survives rebellion over imposition of VAT on energy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR signalled yesterday that he may be prepared to respond to the
slump in the government's popularity by reshuffling his cabinet this summer.
Only hours after the prime minister chaired an inquest into the disastrous
Conservatives performance in last Thursday's elections, fresh evidence of
party disarray emerged as Tory MPs voiced concern over the imposition of VAT
on gas and electricity.
A handful of Conservative MPs last night refused to support the government
during a Commons debate on the details of this year's Budget.
Though the government survived the rebellion, its majority was cut to 10,
and the show of defiance by the rebels was all the more embarrassing, coming
so soon after ministerial appeals to the party to unite and keep its nerve.
Although Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative chairman, publicly ruled out a
reshuffle within the next few days or weeks, the prime minister's office did
nothing to dispel expectation at Westminster that Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, would be moved in a July reshuffle.
Asked about possible cabinet changes, a spokesman, in an implicit
acknowledgment that a reshuffle was under consideration, said: 'The timing
of such things will not be affected by what happened last week.'
Mr Major was yesterday warned by Sir Norman that he needed to restore his
authority as party leader. Downing Street said the prime minister was
prepared to listen more to voters' concerns and was keen that government
policies were 'geared to strengthening and broadening the economic
recovery'. But Mr Major appears equally determined not to be forced into
panic reversals of key government policies.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, said there would be no backdown in his
clash with teachers over the principle of schools testing.
But there were signs that Mr Major was ready to respond to pressure from
other ministers for a tactical retreat on this summer's tests. The prime
minister was said to be anxious to explore whether a truce could be reached
while the government was reviewing the nature of the tests.
Last night, however, the department of education insisted the tests would
remain compulsory, and it denied there was any split with Number 10.
The defensive atmosphere in Whitehall was highlighted by complaints from the
prime minister's office of 'personal bitterness' and 'twisted' newspaper
reports against the government.
Sir Norman will use a speech to the Scottish Tory party conference tomorrow
to urge party unity around areas of agreement - the economy, free enterprise
and reform of industrial relations. Mr Major addresses the conference on
Friday.
Cabinet will discuss on Thursday next year's legislative programme. It faces
a long list of possible bills, many - such as on equalising male and female
state retirement ages - highly controversial. A senior Tory official said
the priority now was a 'sensible and popular' programme.
However, no clear consensus has emerged among ministers or backbench MPs
about the best prescription for restoring Tory party fortunes. An appeal
yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, for Tories
'to keep your nerve' could not paper over divisions between left and right,
and between pro and anti-European factions in the party.

FT  11 MAY 93 / EC seeks US troops for 'safe areas' in Bosnia

THE EUROPEAN Community yesterday called on the US and Russia to send troops
to bolster an expanding United Nations-led effort to create 'safe areas' for
refugees in eastern Bosnia.
The call reflects a stiffening of European opposition to the Clinton
administration's plans to arm the Bosnian Moslems and a determination to
press ahead with economic sanctions to force the Bosnian Serbs to sign the
Vance-Owen peace plan.
The US, meanwhile, yielded to European pressure by announcing it was
delaying a final decision about military action until after next weekend's
Bosnian Serb referendum on the peace plan. It conceded this was because it
had failed to persuade its European allies of the need for more immediate
action.
Mr Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said the US believed
stronger measures were necessary on Bosnia. But the US was 'looking to reach
agreement with our allies on the steps that we can take together'.
During a diplomatic mission to Europe last week, Mr Warren Christopher, US
secretary of state, made no secret that the US favoured arming the Bosnian
Moslems to the riskier course of direct US military intervention. The latest
EC initiative - seeking US and Russian troops to bolster a 'safe areas'
effort - may therefore be seen as an attempt to sidetrack the military
options. During a meeting of EC foreign ministers in Brussels, the Europeans
played down differences with the US over the Bosnian conflict. Ministers
declared that all options, including military, remained open; but they soon
showed a desire to seize the diplomatic initiative from Washington.
Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, won support for his view that the
recent split in Serb ranks over the Vance-Owen plan was a significant
development, resulting from sanctions on the Serbian regime headed by
President Slobodan Milosevic. Ministers agreed it was necessary to test Mr
Milosevic's pledge to seal the border with Bosnia, possibly by sending EC
civilian observers as part of an international group to see if economic
supplies such as fuel and spare parts were filtering through to the Bosnian
Serbs.
Bosnian Serb leaders yesterday accused their former patrons in Belgrade of
stopping them from leaving their self-styled state, saying Serbian police
had refused to allow them to cross the frontier.
But the EC proposal likely to draw most attention is the French idea to
renew invitations to the US - along with Russia and other big powers - to
join the UN-led international peacekeeping effort in Bosnia.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said he welcomed the French plan,
which aims to put teeth into the UN resolution to protect Moslem refugee
enclaves encircled by Serbian artillery.
French officials said the plan was to use US, British, French and Russian
forces to enter safe areas for the Moslems, raising the stakes for Bosnian
Serbs. Mr Juppe commented: 'They will think twice before attacking (these
areas).'
The Clinton administration has remained wary of agreeing to send US ground
forces until the warring parties commit themselves to the Vance-Owen plan
and a ceasefire is in place.
A senior UK official, noting that the Europeans, particularly the British
and French, have already put troops in place to assist in humanitarian
operations, said: 'There is always a different view among those people who
are on the ground and those who are spectators.'
During the Brussels talks, EC foreign ministers dismissed the Bosnian Serb
referendum as a stalling device.
Ministers also condemned the latest outbreak of violence against Moslems in
central Bosnia, laying the blame with the Croats.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Credit figures add to signs of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH consumer has regained an appetite for buying goods on credit,
adding to signs of growing consumer confidence and encouraging hopes that
the UK economic recovery can be sustained.
Net lending to consumers increased to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 232m in
March from Pounds 54m in February, the highest since April 1991, according
to Central Statistical Office figures released yesterday.
The March figure was also more than twice City expectations that consumer
borrowing would rise by a net Pounds 90m in the month.
The CSO monthly net lending figures cover consumer borrowings from finance
houses, other specialist credit companies, building societies (excluding
mortgage lending) and on bank credit cards under the Visa and Mastercard
systems.
The amount of new credit advanced to consumers by these lenders was Pounds
4.73bn in March, the highest monthly figure since such statistics were first
published in 1987. The new credit figure compared with February's total of
Pounds 4.42bn and the Pounds 3.98bn of new consumer credit granted in March
last year.
Yesterday's statistics were welcomed in the Treasury where a spokesman said
they were consistent with other evidence of rising consumer confidence such
as retail sales, strong growth of bank notes and coins in circulation, and
opinion poll evidence of increased consumer optimism.
They coincided with official producer prices figures showing that underlying
inflationary pressures were less than expected last month.
Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist of Kleinwort Benson, the investment
banking group, said the credit figures were very significant. 'They show
that consumers are confident enough about jobs and the general economic
situation to go out and borrow again which is essential if the recovery is
to gain pace'.
In the middle of last year, consumers were net repayers of credit. The
strong March figure brought net lending to consumers by finance houses,
building societies and through the Visa and Mastercard systems to Pounds
436m in the first quarter compared with Pounds 226m in the final quarter of
last year and Pounds 142m in the first quarter of 1992.

FT  11 MAY 93 / EBRD directors demand spending inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HELLIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMITTEE looking into allegations of overspending at the European Bank
of Reconstruction and Development has proposed a sweeping inquiry which will
look at most aspects of the bank's spending policies, including 'special
flight arrangements'.
The committee has recommended that four international firms of auditors be
asked to tender for the role of adviser. The bank's own external auditors,
Deloitte Touche and Tohmatsu will not be among them.
The terms of reference drawn up at a meeting of the EBRD's board of
directors yesterday are rigorous and include what the document describes as
an 'arms length' relationship with the bank's management during the inquiry
given the sensitivity of its work. This, says the document, requires '
strict adherence to confidentiality and independence.'
Mr Claes de Neergaard, Chairman of the Audit Committee, which includes EBRD
directors, has proposed that, in addition to external auditors, outside
quantity surveyors and architects should be appointed 'to ensure the
appearance of absolute independence and objectivity'.
The committee, which will meet in closed session, has asked for between
Pounds 200,000-300,000 to carry out its investigation.
It plans to deliver its report by July 15 although there is scope for it to
carry on longer.
The bank yesterday declined to comment on the audit committee's proposals
for how it wished to conduct its inquiry.
Mr Attali is also believed to have accepted that the committee should look
at the bank's use of private jets.
The inquiry was set up after widespread calls from the bank's international
shareholders following revelations in the Financial Times of expenditure of
Pounds 55.5m by the bank on its London headquarters.
The committee's remit on the EBRD's headquarters expenses will include, but
not be limited to, a review of:
The adequacy of the procedures for tendering and procurement to ensure that
services and goods were processed and payments were made in a regular and
proper fashion so as to obtain proper value for money
*the cost effectiveness of the specification for the project as a whole
*the adequacy of the arrangements for reporting progress on the project to
the board of directors
*the adequacy of the arrangements for managing the project, both within the
bank and between the main contracting parties taking account of best
practice in the European Community
*looking at whether the bank's policy and procedures with respect to fitting
out the temporary headquarters at Leadenhall Street were justified.

FT  11 MAY 93 / EC seeks US troops for 'safe areas' in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community yesterday called on the US and Russia to send troops
to bolster an expanding United Nations-led effort to create 'safe areas' for
refugees in eastern Bosnia.
The call represents a stiffening of European opposition to the Clinton
administration's plans to arm the Bosnian Moslems and a determination to
press ahead with economic sanctions to force the Bosnian Serbs to sign the
Vance-Owen peace plan.
During a meeting of EC foreign ministers in Brussels, the Europeans played
down differences with the US over the Bosnian conflict.
Ministers declared that all options, including military, remained open; but
their desire to seize the diplomatic initiative from Washington soon became
evident.
Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, won support for his view that the
recent split within Serbian ranks over the Vance-Owen plan represented a
significant development which reflected the impact of sanctions on the
Serbian regime headed by President Slobodan Milosevic.
Ministers agreed it was necessary to test Mr Milosevic's pledge to seal the
border with Bosnia, possibly by sending EC civilian observers as part of an
international group to see if economic supplies such as fuel and spare parts
were filtering through to the Bosnian Serbs.
Bosnian Serb leaders yesterday accused their former Belgrade patrons of
stopping them from leaving their self-styled state, saying Serbian police
had refused to allow them to cross the frontier.
But the EC proposal which is likely to draw most attention is the French
idea to renew invitations to the US - along with Russia and other large
powers - to join the UN-led international peacekeeping effort in Bosnia.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said he welcomed the French plan
which aims to put teeth into the latest UN resolution to protect Moslem
refugee enclaves encircled by Serbian artillery.
French officials said the plan was to use US, British, French and Russian
forces to enter safe areas for the Moslems, raising the stakes for Bosnian
Serbs. Mr Juppe commented: 'They will think twice before attacking (these
areas).' The Clinton administration has remained wary of agreeing to send US
ground forces until the warring parties commit themselves to the Vance-Owen
plan and a ceasefire is in place.
Yesterday Washington signalled that it would not move closer to military
action in Bosnia before a weekend referendum by Bosnian Serbs on the peace
plan.
'Bosnia is in a holding period at this time,' said Ms Dee Dee Myers, White
House press secretary.
During a diplomatic mission to Europe last week, Mr Warren Christopher, US
secretary of state, made no secret that the US favoured arming the Bosnian
Moslems rather than the riskier course of direct US military intervention.
The latest EC initiative may therefore be seen as an attempt to sidetrack
the military options.
A senior UK official, noting that the Europeans, particularly the British
and French, have already put troops in place to assist in humanitarian
operations, said: 'There is always a different view among those people who
are on the ground and those who are spectators.'
During the Brussels talks, EC foreign ministers dismissed the Bosnian Serb
referendum as a stalling device. Lord Owen, the EC mediator, said it did not
have 'an ounce of credibility'.

FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Select Appointments shows Pounds 2.5m
deficit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses at Select Appointments (Holdings), the USM-quoted employment agency
group, fell to Pounds 2.53m for the 12 months to December 31.
That compared with a loss, on an FRS 3 basis, of Pounds 1.8m for the
previous nine month period.
Turnover from continuing operations amounted to Pounds 21.7m (Pounds 14.2m),
of which Pounds 15.6m (Pounds 10.4m) was attributable to the UK and Pounds
6.15m (Pounds 3.82m) to Australasia.
There was a loss of Pounds 1.47m at the operating level, against Pounds
809,000. UK operations recorded a deficit of Pounds 1.48m (Pounds 700,000),
while Australasia produced profits of Pounds 16,000 (losses of Pounds
109,000); interest payable amounted to Pounds 913,000 (Pounds 585,000) and
exceptional losses Pounds 153,000 (Pounds 407,000).
Losses per share, on the enlarged capital following a refinancing in October
1991, amounted to 1.06p (26p).
Mr Anthony Martin, chairman, said that during the first quarter Select had
seen a continued improvement in temporary business, but the permanent
recruitment market remained depressed. Nonetheless, he said results for the
first quarter were ahead of the comparable period of last year.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Generali raises capital for subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERALI, Italy's biggest insurance company, is planning a complex
capital-raising deal for its Alleanza life insurance unit. It also announced
slightly higher profits for 1992 after two years of profit falls.
The deal will raise between L457bn and L710bn for Alleanza, which recently
invested heavily in a stake in Banco Ambrosiano Veneto, Italy's biggest
private-sector bank. Details of the capital raising are not finalised and
the impact for Alleanza, Generali or shareholders is unclear.
Generali's net profits rose to L389.8bn (Pounds 165.73m) last year from
L380.6bn in 1991. The increase, after falls as underwriting losses grew, was
in spite of a L349bn write-down on the securities portfolio. Taxation
increased sharply to L149.5bn last year from L65.4bn in 1991.
Operating profits rose to L255.3bn from L108.2bn, on a 21.9 per cent jump in
group premiums to L8,804bn. Preliminary consolidated premiums soared about
40 per cent to L22,425bn. Adjusted for exchange-rate factors and
acquisitions, the rise was about 12.5 per cent.
The improved profits came despite a rise in non-life underwriting losses to
L142.7bn from L112.8bn. By contrast, Generali's life insurance profits rose
to L532.5bn from L493.4bn. Earnings were also boosted by a L249bn gain on
exchange rate movements.
Shareholders' confusion over the Alleanza deal was mitigated by Generali's
decision to pay this year's dividend of L350 a share wholly in cash, instead
of a mixture of cash and Alleanza shares as last year. The Alleanza
transaction involves, first, a free one-for-four issue of 108m new ordinary
shares and 21.6m savings (non-voting) non-convertible shares. That will be
followed by a second capital increase, involving up to 50.7m new ordinary
shares, which will serve a new six-year convertible bond. This bond will pay
interest between 4 and 6 per cent, and will be priced between L9,000 and
L14,000.
Generali will also issue three-year warrants, in a like number to the
convertible bonds, on 16.9m non-convertible Alleanza savings shares it
currently holds. The warrants will be priced at L1,200 each. Generali will
receive L60.9bn for the warrants. Further proceeds will come through the
linked sale of its Alleanza savings shares.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Monday Interview: Blessed with a bit of luck - Edmond
Alphandery, France's new economy minister, speaks to David Buchan and Alice
Rawsthorn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is take-off week for France's new economy minister. He is a co-pilot of
the Balladur government's budget which will be unveiled today, and later he
will be flying solo with the draft legislation he has prepared to make the
Bank of France independent and to sell off many of France's state-owned
companies.
It is a big chance for Edmond Alphandery, a 49-year-old academic
economist-turned-politician, to put his well-honed ideas on money, central
banking, savings, taxation and Europe into practice. His much-repeated
overall aim is to 're-establish a climate of confidence' in France. A small
part of that, however, involves public confidence in the minister himself.
Certainly, Mr Alphandery seems to have what Napoleon desired for his
marshals - a certain amount of personal luck. Perhaps wisely, in 1986 he
stayed out of the Chirac government, preferring to write a book from the
parliamentary backbenches on the dangers for the centre-right of
'cohabiting' with President Francois Mitterrand.
Six years later, wiser still, he made the opposite calculation. Last
December he turned down Mr Mitterrand's suggestion that he go to Brussels as
an EC commissioner, banking on the fact that the centre-right would form the
next government and gambling on the hope he might get the economy portfolio.
True, this portfolio is no longer the super-ministry which the late Mr
Pierre Beregovoy once ruled over. In particular, prime responsibility for
the budget is lost to Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, a long-time Balladur associate.
This explains why Mr Alphandery is 'minister of the economy', with 'finance'
dropped from his title.
Mr Alphandery is well qualified for the job. Almost over-qualified in the
eyes of some of his countrymen who regard as suspect his study of monetarist
and free market economics at The University of Chicago and at Berkeley, as
well his later teaching stint at Pittsburgh. 'There I learnt the theory of
prices, which is a superb science in explaining virtually everything that
goes on in an economy,' he says. 'When I came back, I was one of the first
French economists to teach price theory a l'Anglo-Saxon.'
He still tends to see the economy in terms of the free play of supply and
demand more than many Frenchmen's penchant for administrative direction,
whether in housing policy or interest rates. Indeed, he insists that in
cutting its official rates five times in the past month the Bank of France
was 'not forcing the market, but following it'.
It would not have been in his power or that of the French central bank to
dictate to the market, he stresses. 'Supply and demand on the market are
such that rates are pushed down . . . they (rates) are higher than they
could be, and rational expectations are for a lowering of rates in France.'
Nonetheless, this member of the centrist, Christian Democrat CDS wing of the
UDF federation does not want to be branded a free-marketeer. 'Not every
economist who masters price theory automatically falls in love with the
market . . . My approach is more the German social market than the free
market in all its brutality.' He remains, therefore, very French in his
preference for fixed exchange rates and carefully controlled privatisation.
There is also an element of luck in the timing of his arrival in the plush
sixth-floor ministerial office of the Bercy fortress constructed by Mr
Beregovoy. Though predictions about the slump in the 'real economy' have
worsened in the past month, the monetary indicators have all moved in the
right direction. He claims to have predicted months ago a stronger franc and
lower interest rates, on the basis of four factors.
First, 'hourly wage costs are about 20 per cent lower in France than in
Germany'. Second, even if the rate of price rises has slowed in Germany
because of recession and in France has recently risen, 'there is still an
inflation differential of more than 1.5 percentage points in France's
favour'. Third, 'we in France still have a current account surplus while
Germany has a deficit.' Finally, 'even though our (budget) deficit has got
worse, it is still comparable with Germany's deficit'.
Therefore, the minister claims that it was quite logical that when the new
government came in, promising to 'use whatever means necessary to defend the
franc', two things should have happened. The franc has strengthened from a
rate of FFr3.40-41 to the D-Mark in March to below FFr3.37 last week, and 'I
sleep quietly knowing that there is no reason to worry about the franc'.
The interest rate on three-month money has also dropped from 10.69 per cent
on March 29, the day after the Conservatives' parliamentary victory, to
below 8 per cent last week. Of equal consequence to borrowers has been the
commercial banks' 0.75 per cent cut in their base rate to 9.25 per cent,
'its lowest level since July 25 1986', Mr Alphandery declaims with pleasure.
But is less than a 1 percentage point cut in banks' lending rate enough to
revive France's economy? 'Far from it,' he says. 'The level of our rates is
not where it should be. But we have a further margin of manoeuvre and the
European Monetary System (EMS) does not block us from using it. Clearly, it
would be more agreeable to cut rates when the Germans do. But if they do not
want to do so sufficiently, that is their business - we will still be able
to do so.'
On public finances, the government seems boxed in, though the minister
claims the tax increases to be announced today 'can have a positive effect
if they give credibility to the government and confidence to the country'.
But he claims the government's 'second margin for manoeuvre' is the amount
of state assets it chooses to sell off.
This month's privatisation bill will broadly follow the lines of a similar
operation by conservatives in 1986-87, including reserving chunks of shares
for 'noyaux dur' shareholder groups. 'Rather than have control of a company
raffled back and forth on the stock market . . . it is far better for its
management to have a certain number of shareholders of reference, who know
the company's strategy and have an interest in it succeeding,' says Mr
Alphandery.
Privatisation's pace will depend 'on the stock market's absorption capacity
. . . and we will see how things look at the end of the summer break'. But
the purchasing power is there, says Mr Alphandery. The question, rather, is
how to get some of the FFr1,200bn now in short-term money funds (Sicavs)
into long-term savings or equities. The recent drop in short-term rates is
helping. But the minister also wants to give long-term savers a tax break,
of which first signs could come today.
For all his talk of margins of manoeuvre, there are self-imposed constraints
the minister positively welcomes. One, of course, is putting France's
current low inflation/strong money record into the hands of an independent
Bank of France for safe-keeping.
Mr Alphandery, however, claims the new system which he will unveil on
Tuesday will be 'very French', differing from the Bundesbank and the US
Federal Reserve in being centralised (as distinct from federal) and in
leaving the Bank of France's banking supervision role intact.
He gives no support to persistent rumours that France and Germany will
narrow the EMS band within which their currencies move against each other,
or that their central banks will take some joint institutional step towards
closer co-operation.
'There is plenty already on the table - il y a du pain sur la planche - with
the European Monetary Institute due to be set up within eight months, and
with all that needs to be done to respect the (Maastricht treaty's)
convergence criteria.'
When he was an opposition economist, Mr Alphandery admits, he was one of the
first to say Maastricht's targets should be 'relativised' or softened to
reflect harder economic times. Now, as economy minister, he says 'we can't
go back on these criteria - they are a spur to the necessary discipline' for
monetary union. But the treaty still allows flexible interpretation of the
targets, he stresses.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Japan's government urged to pull out from Cambodia
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE government was last night attempting to head off pressure to
withdraw police officers from peacekeeping duties in Cambodia after the
killing of an officer in an ambush last week.
Mr Keijiro Murata, home affairs minister, will today call for the unarmed
Japanese police officers to be given greater protection or be withdrawn to
Phnom Penh.
Mr Murata arrived in Phomn Phen yesterday for talks with the United Nations
Transitional Authority for Cambodia over the safety of Japanese personnel.
Untac has so far refused to accede to Japanese government demands to
withdraw the police to safer areas, on the grounds that this would be
preferential treatment.
If Mr Murata is unable to return with a pledge that the police will be given
greater protection, it is likely pressure for their recall will grow.
The issue is highly sensitive for the Japanese government because the
despatch of peacekeepers to Cambodia was presented as a symbol of Japan's
commitment to play a wider role in UN affairs.
Japan sent 600 military personnel and 75 police officers in October to help
oversee the run-up to elections due to be held from May 23 to 28.
In a frank meeting with Japanese police officers yesterday Mr Murata was
asked by Mr Hiroto Yamazaki, the head of the police contingent in Cambodia:
'How many of us will have to die before you decide to pull the Japanese
police out of Cambodia?'
Mr Kabun Muto, the foreign minister, who was visiting the family of Mr
Haruyuki Takata, the slain policeman, said he was reluctant to consider a
full-scale withdrawal of the police.
Howver, Mr Yohei Kono, the cabinet secretary, acknowledged that the
government was under pressure to clarify its position over the conditions in
which it would withdraw the personnel.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Tokyo police hold foreign workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOKYO police and immigration officials yesterday mounted an unprecedented
raid on foreign workers as they gathered in a park in the Japanese capital.
They were allegedly breaking immigration laws.
The authorities took 102 foreigners into custody in the highest profile
action yet to stop mainly Iranian workers from gathering in Yoyogi Park on
the outskirts of central Tokyo.
Every Sunday over the past two years the park has been a meeting place for
several thousand mainly Iranian men. The entrance to the park where the men
gather takes on the air of a middle eastern bazaar with stalls selling
Iranian food, music cassettes and haircuts, as well as forged telephone
cards. The authorities also allege there is extensive drug dealing.
Immigration officials and police officers used several vans to take away 68
Iranians, 11 Malaysians as well as Nepalese and Pakistani workers.
On April 28 the authorities signalled their intention to crack down on the
gatherings when the Tokyo metropolitan government started planting about
3,000 azalea bushes in areas of the park where the men gather. They then
cordoned off the area with high fences, ostensibly to protect the plants.
Immigration officials said all the men taken away had overstayed their visas
in Japan and were working illegally in factories and on construction sites.
They said the men would be repatriated soon.
The illegal foreign workers are in part victims of the sharp economic
downturn. They were mainly attracted to Japan during the high growth of the
late 1980s when it became commonplace for young Japanese to refuse to do
dirty, dangerous or difficult manual jobs.

A HOSTEL for foreign refugees was firebombed and a graveyard for victims of
Nazi persecution was wrecked in the latest attacks blamed on right-wing
extremists in Germany, police said yesterday, Reuter reports from Berlin.
No one was injured when a petrol bomb thrown at a refugee home in eastern
Germany on Saturday night failed to ignite.
Police could not immediately say how many people or what nationalities lived
in the hostel in Teterow district in the northern state of
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
In the state capital Schwerin, police said vandals toppled 81 tombstones at
a cemetery commemorating those who died resisting Nazi rule.
It was not known who wrecked the graveyard on Friday night. Refugees from
impoverished eastern Europe and the developing world, drawn by Germany's
liberal law on political asylum, have been the chief targets of brutal
attacks by neo-Nazis in the past 18 months.

FT  10 MAY 93 / The last wise man speaks out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An ounce of emotion is worth a ton of facts, I was told by one of my first
editors. It is a lesson that George Kennan seems to have learned well. His
idiosyncratic new book, Around the Cragged Hill: A Personal and Political
Philosophy* is delectably outspoken. It combines intensely personal
reflections on the human predicament with a searing, yet good-humoured,
critique of modern American society.
Mr Kennan, a veteran diplomat and scholar, once earned the sobriquet
'America's last wise man.' Still best known for his role as a principal
architect of the US's post second world war 'containment of communism'
strategy, he has in his late 80s begun to turn his mind to domestic matters.
He has two suggestions for solving US social woes, both of which are too
bold to be taken seriously in Washington. The first is the division of the
US into 12 largely self-governing republics, such as 'New England', the 'old
south', the 'northwest' and so on. He argues that the US, along with the
former Soviet Union, China, India and Brazil, is a 'monster country',
ungover-nable because it is simply too big and diverse to be run from a
single capital city. The states, on the other hand, are mostly too small to
become viable independent units.
He claims the false premise in all domestic debates - be it health care,
drugs, abortion or whatever - is that any one policy either could or should
suit all parts of the continent. Virtual dismemberment is the only long-run
solution; it would have the advantage, he says, of allowing southern regions
to merge into Latin America if that is what they want. (Actually this idea
does have some support: in the Pacific northwest pundits have pondered the
feasibility of hiving off a few states and creating a separate country
called 'Cascadia').
Mr Kennan's other idea is to create a 'Council of State' consisting of nine
distinguished citizens drawn from any walk of life except politics. They
would be appointed by the president but he (or she) would be able to choose
only from a panel of 100 people, selected strictly on merit and without
political bias. Mr Kennan hopes that such a council, while formally only an
advisory body, would eventually gain the same kind of clout as the Supreme
Court. It would address the great domestic issues of the day, such as the
budget deficit and health care, and try to determine what is in the nation's
long-term interest.
The great virtue of the council, Mr Kennan argues, is that it would be
non-elected. In some measure it would thus compensate for the inadequacies
of Congress and the presidency, bodies whose ability to act in the national
interest have been fatally undermined by short-term political pressures.
His personal and political philosophy is just as startling. He starts from
the premise that man is an irredeemably flawed vessel. His crude innate
impulses - especially the desire to prevail over others - are permanently in
conflict with morality and the ideals of civilised life. Mortality and the
cruel vagaries of chance, meanwhile, create an 'inevitable element of
tragedy' in every human life.
The only way out is through religious faith. Yet, in common with many
others, Mr Kennan has found the concept of an all-powerful God impossible to
reconcile with a world of arbitrary suffering. His novel solution is to
believe in two Gods: a Primary Cause who brought the physical world into
being and has no interest in our fate; and an entirely separate Merciful
Deity, partly within us, to whom we can turn at a time of need. This latter
deity has no control over the objective conditions of our lives but, for
believers, provides a superhuman reser-voir of spiritual strength. Mr Kennan
writes movingly of his contact with this deity.
His political philosophy defies conventional categories. He roundly condemns
America's 'intense commercialism' and fails to see anything desirable in
economic growth per se. 'Would there not be something diseased, something
cancerous, something open-ended and unstable, about an economy that had to
be constantly growing to be seen as adequate to national needs?' Yet he has
no time for left-wing critics of market economics either, largely because
their utopian philosophies fail to come to terms with man's flawed nature.
He castigates the lip service paid to egalitarianism, rejecting the claim
that heavier taxes on the rich can possibly make anybody else better off. 'I
find, in the liberal treatment of these questions, so much
oversimplification, social jealously and intellectual posturing that I have
no choice but to disassociate myself from it.' Indeed, he is sufficiently
indifferent to fashionable opinion to lament the disappearance of domestic
service, inviting the reader to imagine de Tocqueville, or any great writer,
washing pans and emptying the trash.
There is a disturbingly elitist and authoritarian undercurrent in much of Mr
Kennan's book: at times he does not bother to hide his conviction that most
people do not really know what is good for them. Yet there is also a bite
and an honesty in his writing that is wonderfully refreshing.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Lost soul of socialism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
They say socialism is dead. Such an over-simplification is almost certainly
misleading; it may even be wrong. Conservatives utter it as a mindless cry
of triumph. But they do not tell us the answer to the next question: does
this mean that our democracy will now start to work a little better; or will
it in fact work a lot worse?
It is a fact that Marxist dogma and communist practice have both suffered
comprehensive intellectual and political defeats in eastern Europe.
Moreover, many socialist parties in western Europe have also been struck by
a series of disasters in the recent past.
In March, the French Socialist party suffered its greatest electoral defeat
in the country's modern history. The impression that France's ageing
Socialist president, Francois Mitterrand, is just the lone relic of a fin de
regime has been tragically underlined by the suicide of his former Socialist
prime minister and ally, Mr Pierre Beregovoy.
His longstanding rival, Mr Michel Rocard, has now seized control of the
Socialist party in the hope that he can arrest, and if possible reverse, its
total collapse. Rocard is trying to rebuild the party on entirely new bases,
possibly in alliance with other political forces.
In Italy, the crisis wreaking mayhem throughout the political establishment
was detonated by revelations of wholesale corruption in the Socialist party.
Bettino Craxi, the former prime minister, is one of many leading politicians
under investigation for corruption and has been forced out of the leadership
of the party. His successor, Giorgio Benvenuto, has already promised
sweeping reforms, which could go as far as the formation of a new party,
with a new name and a new symbol, possibly in alliance with other political
parties.
In Germany the Social Democrat Party (SPD) is in disarray after the abrupt
resignation of its leader, Mr Bjorn Engholm, following damaging new
revelations about an old dirty-tricks episode. In Spain, the ruling
Socialist party has been tarnished by a decade in power and by corruption,
and faces defeat in next month's general elections. In Britain, the Labour
party snatched defeat from the jaws of victory in the last general election.
Paralysed by convention and past dogmas, it looks set to be defeated again
in the next.
In fact, if you exclude the Labour party, most of this cluster of events can
be explained simply by the spread of political corruption and dirty tricks.
In Italy and France all the main parties of government, not just the
Socialists, have been deeply implicated in illegal party-financing
skulduggery. It's just that the French Socialists seem to have done it more
systematically than the other parties. In both countries, the voters only
rebelled after magistrates exposed systematic law-breaking.
Jean-Marie Guehenno, who is head of policy planning at the French Foreign
Ministry, thinks we should not be surprised by the spread of corruption. In
his new book, he argues that political corruption is just one of the logical
consequences of global markets, international networking and the information
revolution. Other consequences are the reduction of all other values to
money, the overwhelming of national political systems and the disintegration
of traditional democratic values. You may not be surprised to learn that his
book is called La Fin de la Democratie (published by Flammarion).
His diagnosis may be too pessimistic. But it is clear that the forces at
work in the new international economic environment make it very difficult
for any government to follow old-fashioned socialist policies, without
retreating into Cuba-style isolation and backwardness. France's Socialists
tried it in 1981, but by 1983 they discovered they must choose between
socialism and the European Community; they chose Europe.
Leaders such as Michel Rocard and Giorgio Benvenuto and, yes, John Smith,
face a double challenge - to salvage something plausible from the implicit
corpus of socialist ideals, in terms which are consistent with market
pricing, and to see if this can be made into a vote-winning platform of
government.
Neither task will be easy. Chunks of the old socialism, including
nationalisation and command interventionism, have fallen into the road.
Swathes of the old socialist voters, such as trade unionists from heavy
industry, have migrated to the middle classes, to informal employment, or to
unemployment. Today's central challenge, moreover, is not redistribution or
expanding the welfare state, but the generation of wealth on competitive
terms.
But the task cannot be impossible, because British-style conservatives are
also imprisoned in their own philosophical quandary, which is just as
difficult. This is the quandary of reductionism or political alienation. The
problem with liberal democracy is that liberalism is all about the
individual, and about costs and prices, whereas democracy is all about
shared values, common interests and collective action.
The tension between the two is unavoidable. The more the conservatives press
the pedal of liberalism, the more they glorify the individual against the
community, the more they elevate commerce against culture, the more they
stress prices against values.
This must leave room for an alternative view of society and culture,
community and social solidarity. Many years ago, a German coined the concept
of a social market economy; and he was a conservative. If Jean-Marie
Guehenno is right, money is now the only value, even in politics. But if he
is wrong, perhaps an updated socialist party could take over the concept of
One Nation.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on Denmark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH pressures inside the Exchange Rate Mechanism have subsided in
recent months, close attention will be paid to the Danish krone's moves
inside the system this week, writes James Blitz.
With only 10 days to go to Denmark's second referendum on European Monetary
Union, some dealers will be jittery about the Danish currency. Few can
forget that the rejection of the first referendum nearly a year ago was the
overture to the autumn currency crisis.
There appears to be a better chance of the treaty being ratified by the
Danish people this time, although an opinion poll on Friday showed that the
number of people voting No in the referendum had increased from 33 per cent
to 39 per cent.
The Danish krone therefore starts the week somewhat weaker in the ERM grid,
with a divergence of 42 percentage points against its central Ecu rate.
Several opinion polls are due to be released this week and they will be
closely watched.
One factor which may support the krone is the D-Mark's weakness against most
European currencies, which has been a theme of recent trading.
Barely a week goes by now without the Bundesbank easing some instrument of
monetary policy, and there will be a close watch again on Wednesday's repo
rate fixing.
There were signs last week that the weakness in the German economy was
starting to make itself felt in the dollar/D-Mark exchange rate. Despite a
poorer than expected non-farm payroll figure for April, the dollar rose by
nearly  1/2 a pfennig on the day.
This week's US indicators may help investors decide what view to take of the
US economic upturn. Retail sales figures for April are due out on Thursday.
Friday sees the release of industrial production figures for the same month.

RESULTS DUE
BRITISH Telecommunications is expected to report on Thursday a drop in
pre-tax profits for the year ended March to about Pounds 2.5bn from Pounds
3bn a year earlier. The fall will be, however, after redundancy payments of
about Pounds 500m and exceptional costs of around Pounds 200m for
restructuring, redemption of bonds and other items. Underlying profit growth
last year was therefore around 2 to 3 per cent. Inland call volumes rose,
helping to offset lower tariffs. Further redundancy costs are expected this
year with the market looking for profits in the Pounds 3.2bn-Pounds 3.5bn
range.
J Sainsbury, the food retailer, is forecast to report on Wednesday a hefty
increase in pre-tax profits for the year ended March to around Pounds 740m
from Pounds 628m a year earlier. Unlike Tesco it has managed to maintain its
growth momentum on sales volume while retaining a grip on costs.
Grand Metropolitan is expected to report first half pre-tax profits of
Pounds 400m to Pounds 413m on Thursday, 2 to 3 per cent ahead of last year's
result, excluding exceptionals. Trading profits from the IDV spirits
business will be boosted by currency translation but the favourable exchange
rate is unlikely to compensate entirely for lower dollar profits from US
food operations.
Royal Dutch Shell group will announce its first quarter results on Thursday
with analysts forecasting a wide range of income figures of between Pounds
600m and Pounds 800m on a replacement cost basis which strips out
stockholding losses and gains. The company reported a profit of Pounds 770m
in the same period last year, but this was buoyed by one-off exceptional
items. The results will signal how successful the company has been at
cutting costs and maintaining its profits against a background of falling
oil prices and deteriorating sales margins.
Body Shop is forecast to report on Wednesday a drop in pre-tax profits for
the year to February of about 20 per cent to around Pounds 20m. While
international expansion continues apace, UK prices and margins have slipped
and volume growth has faltered.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Economics: Attention focuses on UK inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTENTION returns to UK inflation this week with today's release of the
April producer prices index.
Input prices have shot-up since the pound was devalued last autumn, putting
pressure on manufacturers' profit margins. So far, however, industry appears
to have absorbed most of the price increases for fuel and raw materials.
This is reflected in the relative stability of the prices of goods leaving
factory gates. Output price inflation has remained stable at a rate of
around 3.5 per cent since the end of last year.
Economists have forecast some upwards movement in the output prices index
for April as the increase in excise duties of the March budget, and higher
food prices feed through. Input prices may ease slightly, reflecting
sterling's appreciation during April.
Producer price inflation figures are also due out in the US. Prices are
expected to have slowed quite sharply last month, following reductions in
tobacco prices and air fares. To some extent these factors will be offset by
higher prices for most agricultural commodities.
The release in Spain of quarterly unemployment survey data later this week,
is unlikely to provide much comfort for the hard-pressed government. In the
fourth quarter of last year the survey showed that 20 per cent of the labour
force was unemployed. Most economists expect the new figures to show a small
rise.
The following are some of the week's other economic highlights. The figures
in brackets are the median of analysts' forecasts, supplied by MMS
International, a financial information company.
Today: UK, March credit business (up Pounds 90m); April producer prices
index - input (flat on month, up 7.7 per cent on year), output (up 0.5 per

FT  10 MAY 93 / Risk and Reward: Portfolio managers find comfort in precious
metals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US jobless figures released last Friday offered little comfort to the
world's gold bugs, who have been enthusiastically buying precious metals for
weeks. With manufacturing jobs in decline during April, and only small gains
in the overall workforce, the inflation picture remains cloudy.
However indeterminate the immediate economic picture, portfolio managers
seem willing to bet that the inflation rate will rise sooner or later, as
reflected in the steep slope in the US Treasury bond yield curve.
That attitude has not been lost on the world's investment bankers, who are
busy designing commodity-backed derivatives to serve as a form of
inflation-backstop in diversified portfolios.
Riding the wave of Mr George Soros' well-publicised shift into gold options,
five large banking houses have issued gold warrants in the past four weeks.
Merrill Lynch was agile enough to issue silver warrants as well, much to the
admiring chagrin of its close competitors.
Warrants differ from the usual put and call options in that they are issued
for periods of one year or longer. Like an option, they allow the holder to
buy or sell the underlying commodity at a given price and time.
Warrants do not require the day-to-day margin maintenance needed for
exchange-traded futures and options, and, because they resemble securities,
are acceptable to some portfolios that cannot trade other forms of
derivatives.
Whether it was inflation-hedging, copy-cat admiration, or a bullish shift in
the supply-demand situation for precious metals, issuers said the gold
warrants - mostly calls - sold briskly, and followed the gold market higher
most of last week.
Less easily marketed will be a series of new warrants to be issued in London
today by Goldman Sachs. Each warrant represents one unit of the Goldman
Sachs Commodity Total Return index, a barometer of mostly industrial
commodity futures.
The firm says the index is more representative of the overall inflation
situation than precious metals.
A glance at the components of the index make clear that the GSCI warrants
will lack the appeal of gold. Oil prices, which have the heaviest weighting
in the index, have been moving sideways. Farm products, particularly
cereals, are flat, and prices for industrial metals, like copper and
aluminium, have tumbled since January.
Since April 1, the GSCI Total Return index has fallen from 2,506 to 2,464,
and a brief chat with a copper, aluminium, or maize producer will reveal
that overcapacity and accumulating stocks will keep prices in those
industries under pressure for some time.
Mr Neil Bresolin, executive director of commodity derivatives for Goldman
Sachs, agrees the index price has been sagging, but argues that, regardless
of its direction, it provides a strong inflation hedge.
'If the prices of all of these items go up, your business costs are going to
go up,' he says. The index, he says, has a strong correlation to the US
consumer price index, and a strong negative correlation to US bond prices.
A portfolio manager scanning the inflation horizon might do well to question
why precious metals are rallying as an industrial commodities index sags.
Take out the threat of war, unstable currencies, or outright speculation, it
simply may be the supply-demand picture for precious metals is brightening.
Silver, for example, has been subject to a supply glut and a steady price
slide since the Hunt Brothers' silver bubble burst in 1980.
Prices moved below production costs in most of the Americas, forcing many
mines to close or reduce output. Silver is often mined as a by-product of
copper, and as copper prices drop, those mines are also expected to cut
production.
At the same time, historically low prices have stimulated world demand.
In the past three months, spot silver prices have risen 25 per cent, from
Dollars 3.50 per ounce to Dollars 4.35. But the rally is likely to stall
when prices hit Dollars 5, the level US producers need to reopen mothballed
mines.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Eurobonds: Brazilians go for funds at below domestic rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZILIAN banks and companies are flocking to the Eurobond market, eager to
take advantage of the relatively attractive interest rates at which they can
borrow.
So far this year, 22 Brazilian banks and companies have issued Eurobonds,
raising more than Dollars 1.4bn. In a rush to take advantage of what may be
a short-lived opportunity, many more issues are planned, provoking fears
among some analysts that a new debt bubble is being created.
Given that real interest rates fluctuate between 20 and 40 per cent per
annum in Brazil, the attraction of the Eurobond market to Brazilian
borrowers is understandable.
Even though the Brazilians are paying the highest interest rates in the
Eurobond market - with yield spreads at around 500 to 600 basis points over
the relevant US Treasury bond - at least they are able to raise funds at
well below domestic interest rates.
For investors, it is a rare opportunity to earn 11 to 14 per cent per annum
at a time when US interest rates are at an historic low.
When Brazil returned to the international capital markets two years ago with
an issue by Petrobras, the paper was soaked up mostly by holders of Latin
American flight capital who were familiar with the companies and were
looking for a return above that being earned on their Swiss bank accounts.
Today, many of the buyers of Brazilian Eurobonds are institutional
investors, devoting a small part of their portfolio to high-risk,
high-return instruments.
'Increasingly we are seeing pension funds and insurance companies getting in
on the act', says Mr Saulo Blauth, general manager of the international
department of Banco do Brasil.
Ironically, Brazil's success in establishing itself on the Euromarkets is
directly linked to its failure to implement economic reform which has
resulted in higher risks and hence higher return compared with other Latin
American paper.
For this, the Brazilians are paying a high price. During the first spate of
issues in 1991-92, yield spreads fell from 700 basis points over US Treasury
bonds to 300 basis points.
However, the Collorgate scandal and impeachment of President Fernando Collor
in the second half of last year - combined with general concern among
international investors about the large number of issues being prepared by
Latin American names - shook the market and ultimately brought new issues to
a halt.
This year, companies have been paying yield spreads of 700 basis points on
bonds which generally carry a 2 1/2 -year maturity, although Banco do Brasil
recently placed a Dollars 100m, five-year deal at a yield spread of around
540 basis points.
According to Mr Blauth, 'good companies are starting to get a better spread.
Through aggressive selling we got 490 basis points over the US Treasury for
Petrobras in March, but small companies are still paying (yield spreads of)
700 to 800 basis points.'
He adds: 'For top-notch companies like CVRD (the state mining company), it
is absurd that they should be paying 400 to 500 basis points over the US
Treasury, but for the company this is still very attractive compared with
borrowing in Brazil.'
Telebras, the telecommunications group, has bonds trading in the secondary
market at around 460 to 480 basis points over Treasuries. Although spreads
on Telebras bonds fell as low as 365 basis points last May, they
subsequently widened again to over 500 basis points in the autumn before
falling back to their current levels.
Merrill Lynch is expected to launch a new five-year issue for the group
soon, and the market will be watching closely to see where the launch spread
is set.
Unlike the first spate of issues, which were mostly by well-known Brazilian
companies, the majority of recent issuers have been banks who can make hefty
profits from on-lending the money to domestic customers who do not have the
name or internal resources to launch Eurobond issues themselves.
'The main attraction for the banks is that they can borrow dollars at, say,
12 per cent, and then lend it on at 13 to 15 per cent,' according to one
London-based Latin American analyst.
Aside from public offers, there have also been some private placements,
particularly by Brazilian subsidiaries of multinationals. Shell recently
placed Dollars 200m in export notes, and Alcoa and IBM did export
securitisation operations for Dollars 100m and Dollars 150m respectively.
Mr Jose Luis Miranda, president of Banco InterAtlantico, comments: 'This may
be good for the microeconomy, but on a macrolevel it is terrible. If I was
governor of the central bank I would stop it.'
He points out the central bank is having to pay 20 per cent annual interest
on the cruzeiros it issues while receiving only 3 per cent on the dollars it
receives, thus provoking mounting domestic debt.
The risk of lending to such an unstable economy may be less than the 30 per
cent monthly inflation rate suggests. Brazil has many world-class companies
and its foreign exchange reserves are at an historic high of Dollars 23bn,
making the chances of default minimal.
Mr Georg Lipsztein, a director of Banco Nacional which has issued Dollars
200m in Eurobonds, says: 'Overseas investors know very well that with
Brazil's level of reserves and top class companies their investment is
sound. They are simply cashing in on the risk premium of Brazil.'
Some analysts fear a problem may arise with lesser-known private companies
if demand does not keep pace with expansion of productive capacity financed
through Eurobonds.
But Mr Miranda believes this is unlikely, pointing out 'most of this money
is going to improve debt profile not for productive investments'.
But the greatest risk lies with the mercurial character of President Itamar
Franco and his dislike of financial markets. Moreover, there is no guarantee
that the country's economic situation will improve.
In the meantime there are more issues coming up including Banco Mercantil,
Banco Itamaraty, Villares and Banespa. Mr Blauth says 'I think there is
still space for a lot of issues but we need to take advantage of this window
of opportunity because we don't know how long it will last.'

FT  10 MAY 93 / US Money and Credit: Investors find the old rule holds true
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OLD financial markets rule, 'buy on the rumour, sell on the fact,' held
true last week when the US Treasury finally announced its long-awaited
decision on restructuring the government's debt mix.
There had been plenty of buying on the rumours (which mostly predicted that
the Treasury would decide that the best way to cut federal interest costs
would be to issue fewer long bonds and more shorter-dated securities in
future), and when the facts were released, there was an initial surge of
selling.
Prices, however, did not fall particularly far, as the selling was
restricted by the fact that the rumours had proved well sourced, so there
was no real element of surprise. The Treasury's plans consist of shortening
the maturity on government debt by reducing the frequency of long bond
auctions, eliminating the seven-year note and boosting issues of securities
with a maturity of five years or less.
In all, the market's reaction was rather muddled. Bond investors examined
the Treasury's planned changes, and, unsure what to make of it, quickly
diverted their attention to other matters, such as the April employment
report.
The Treasury's moves, however, deserve closer consideration than the market
seems to have afforded them. Mr Joe Liro and Ms Mary Rooney, of Warburg
Securities in New York, made an interesting point in their instant analysis
on the subject.
They pointed out that the Treasury's decision to place the emphasis of debt
management on short-term financing gave the Federal Reserve an even greater
role in determining the government's financing costs. 'Once the Federal
Reserve embarks on a course of monetary restraint,' they wrote, 'short rates
will come under pressure and Treasury financing costs will soar. If the Fed
shows a reluctance to tighten when a policy of restraint is necessary, its
anti-inflation credibility will be immediately called into question by the
financial markets.'
In other words, there will be more at stake than ever when the Fed decides
to tighten or loosen monetary policy.
Although the latest readings on the US economy suggest the strong pace of
growth achieved at the tail end of 1992 is slackening, most economists
expect the Fed's next likely move on interest rates to be up rather than
down. They also expect the Fed to take precautionary measures designed to
ensure inflationary pressures do not revive when business activity begins to
hit its stride in late 1993 or 1994.
The shortening of the maturity on government debt, however, means that in
future the Fed will have to consider carefully what affect its tightening of
policy will have on the government's interest costs.
With a president occupying the White House who is extremely keen to reduce
the drag on economic growth that the huge federal budget deficit represents,
those considerations will weigh heavily on the Fed.
Generally, the Treasury's decision on the debt mix did not go down
especially well on Wall Street. The consensus was the government was playing
a dangerous game, betting its debt management policy on long-term interest
rate movements.
At the core of the critics' complaints was the view that the shortening of
maturities will make the federal debt more of a hostage to interest rate
rises.
Mr Geoffrey Dennis, of James Capel in New York, said that with more debt
maturing at an earlier stage the Treasury's changes mean a more rapid
refinancing of already-issued debt will be required. 'Should interest rates
rise in the interim, this refinancing will become more expensive.'
There was also an unhappiness with a politicisation of the debt management
process. Analysts felt the government should be concentrating more of its
energies on lowering the deficit, and less on lowering the interest costs of
that deficit through, as Salomon Brothers called it, 'a superficial
reshuffling of Treasury debt priorities'.

FT  10 MAY 93 / UK Gilts: Negative factors set to hold back upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALONG with the green shoots often come some creepy crawlies. These thoughts
bucked up the gilt market last week, as indications strengthened that any UK
upturn will be held back by negative factors, such as high household debt
and economic weakness across the rest of Europe.
Nervousness that the UK economy is still sickly was due partly to the belief
that the US recovery might be slackening, a factor that would further
depress export markets. Also, the latest money supply data indicated
consumer spending might not be growing by as much as some economists
believe.
These factors arrested the sharp decline in gilt prices that had been
evident the week before. Yields at the short end fell up to 10 basis points
on the week, with a corresponding increase in prices, while yields for
longer-dated securities were little changed.
An important factor holding up prices at the short end were the shock
defeats by the Conservative party in the Newbury and county council
elections.
The inference that the government might be forced into a further cut in base
rates to lift its sagging popularity led to some buying support for gilts of
less than 10 years maturity. Base rates have been held at 6 per cent since
late January, even though many industrialists and consumers are still
calling for easier borrowing conditions.
At the longer end of the yield curve, there was a firm ceiling over price
rises. Investors were worried by theories that the large volume of gilts
likely to be on offer over the next year to fund the big government deficit
will push down prices.
In particular, the Bank of England is thought likely to announce in the next
few days another Pounds 3bn gilt auction for later this month, possibly for
stock of about 10 years in maturity. The thought of another auction so soon
after the one last month - which attracted relatively little interest from
important groups of gilt investors - acted to damp investor spirits.
M0, the narrow measure of the money supply which mainly comprises notes and
coins in circulation, grew in the year to last month by a seasonally
adjusted 4.8 per cent, after year-on-year growth of 4.9 per cent in March.
This was the first fall in the year-on-year increase in M0 since December,
and indicated that any upturn may be weak. 'There are few doubts that the
recovery has started but there is a question mark over its robustness,' said
Mr John Shepperd, economist at S. G. Warburg Securities.
Assuming such sentiments continue to be in evidence in the next few weeks,
then gilt prices could yet see a new spurt. Investors will find out today
from the Central Statistical Office how much extra credit consumers took on
in March, an indicator that will provide clues as to the strength of any
upturn. The consensus among City economists is that this figure will be
about Pounds 90m.
Also, the gilt market will be watching for today's release of the figures
for producer price inflation for last month. Output price inflation remained
stable at a year-on-year rate of around 3.4 per cent in the second half of
last year.
After registering 3.7 per cent in both February and March, it may show a
rise to 3.9 per cent in the year to April, according to the City consensus.
Such a rise would be worrying for many in the gilt market on the basis that
this would indicate an upsurge in demand pressures.
However, at a retail price level Mr Julian Callow, a bonds specialist at
Kleinwort Benson, remains optimistic that rising prices are some way from
becoming a problem. He calculates that in the year to last month the
increase in the retail prices index will turn out to be just 1.5 per cent,
after 1.9 per cent in March, while the figure for the RPI less mortgage
costs will fall to 3.1 per cent from 3.5 per cent.
While weak underlying demand pressures are one factor behind Mr Callow's
bullishness over inflation, another is the change in the RPI caused by the
introduction of the council tax in place of the more expensive poll tax. If
Mr Callow's arithmetic is proved correct when the RPI announcement for April
is made a week on Friday , this will probably give a strong boost to gilts.

FT  10 MAY 93 / German Bonds: View of bund market as 'safe haven' loses
appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITHIN a matter of weeks, investors' views on the attractions of the German
bund market have soured appreciably.
It was only on April 14 that the yield on 10-year bunds dropped to 6.45 per
cent, down from over 9 per cent in the summer of last year. This reflected
enormous buying from primarily foreign investors.
Mr Klaus Holzschuh, head of fixed income research at Commerzbank in
Frankfurt, calculates that foreigners invested DM190bn in the 14 months to
the end of February this year - more than twice the level in 1991, the
previous record year.
That wave of buying has not given way to massive selling. But enthusiasm for
the long end of the market has dwindled and yields are back above 6.8 per
cent and - if the pessimists are to be believed - are likely to drift up to
7 per cent over the course of the year.
The buying was inspired primarily by two factors: hopes of cuts in interest
rates and perceptions that the D-Mark offered a 'safe-haven' in times of
political and economic uncertainty.
Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Midland Global Market
Research in London, says the safe-haven argument has lost its appeal at a
time when tensions within the ERM have eased.
She believes it will revive only if the Danes deliver a 'no' vote in their
referendum on the Maastrict treaty on May 18.
As for long-term interest rates, Ms Cottrell says they are now 'so low that
they cannot go any lower'. With inflation running at over 4 per cent, real
long-term rates are around 2.5 per cent.
Despite cautious words from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, and
other members of the policy-making council, economists are convinced the
severity of the German recession will prompt further sharp cuts in
short-term rates over the rest of the year.
Although inflation is running at twice the Bundesbank's long-term target
rate of 2 per cent, the central bank can camouflage its monetary easing by
reference to money supply.
After enormous distortion caused by currency inflows last autumn and their
aftermath, M3 broad money growth is likely to be within its 4.5 to 6.5 per
cent target for the year. This will allow the Bundesbank to claim future
inflation is being brought under control.
Mr Thomas Mayer, economist at Goldman Sachs, believes the central bank has
'stepped up a gear' in its easing of monetary policy. It cut its discount
and Lombard rates on April 22 - taking the crucial discount rate down 0.25
of a percentage point to 7.25 per cent - and delivered a sharp cut in the
repo rate the following week.
The Bundesbank has made clear its determination that the German yield curve,
which has for so long been steeply inverted, should normalise: that is,
short-term rates should be lower than long-term rates.
It would like to achieve this by bringing down short rates and seeing
long-term yields stay where they are rather than rise.
The latter would be a possibility if investors lost faith in the
Bundesbank's ability to combat inflation over the long-term - or if they
start to contemplate the implications of Germany's ballooning public sector
debt, more details of which will emerge next week.
Economists now expect the discount rate to be down to 5 or 6 per cent by the
end of the year. From an investment point of view, that means stay at the
short end of the yield curve and avoid the longer end. Or abandon bunds
altogether.

SARRIO, the Spanish cardboard producer controlled by Italy's Saffa group,
announced a sharp fall in net profits to Pta105m (Dollars 906,000) for 1992
from Pta2.7bn.
The group said the blame lay solely with the Kuwait Investment Office.
Mr Carlo Bonomi, chairman, said Sarrio was owed Pta8.6bn by Grupo Torras,
KIO's investment arm in Spain, which bought Sarrio's special paper
operations in February 1991.
Sarrio is suing Torras, as well as the KIO and the Kuwait Investment
Authority, the investment office's controlling department, for non-payment
on the trans-action.
At the same time, Sarrio has been forced to provide against a fall in the
value of shares in Torras-controlled companies it acquired as part payment
on the deal.
Grupo Torras went into receivership at the end of last year. Mr Bonomi said
Sarrio's results had been dramatically affected by the KIO.

FT  10 MAY 93 / International Company News: Russians set date for Rbs1bn
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN authorities plan to press ahead with their often-postponed first
Treasury bill issue on May 18. The issue will be for Rbs1bn worth of
three-month Treasury bills to make a start in financing the country's
enormous budget deficit without printing money.
The Treasury bill market, however, will initially be closed to foreigners.
Mr Andrei Kozlov, the central bank official handling the issue, said the
bills would be sold at a discount likely to produce a 100 per cent annual
yield, well below inflation currently running at 1,100 per cent a year.
But he said that Russian commercial banks and exporters would have an
incentive to buy the bills. It would be better than keeping huge amounts of
vital cash to compensate for the fact that the Russian central bank can take
weeks or months to transfer money through its rickety payments system.
'We are promising instant liquidity,' Mr Kozlov said
The central bank also has a habit of hanging on to rapidly-depreciating
roubles owed to exporters who have to sell 30 per cent of their hard
currency earnings to it.
Mr Alexei Kuznetsov, acting chairman of Incombank, one of 20 official
dealers, said the issue would be attractive if banks could hold part of
their reserves in the form of treasury bills. The current reserve
requirement is 20 per cent.
Mr Pavel Zhikharev, chairman of Sberbank, the country's nationwide savings
bank, which until recently had its deposits simply appropriated by the
government to help finance the budget deficit, said his bank was likely to
buy the bills.
He added that this was on condition that the bills would indeed yield 100
per cent and not be subject to tax, as promised by the authorities.
Mr Boris Fyodorov, finance minister, who has long insisted the authorities
start to finance the budget deficit using 'civilised' methods such as
treasury bills, complained recently that high inflation would make it
difficult to 'sell a decent amount' of them.
But Ms Bella Zlatkis, head of the finance ministry's securities department,
said the government proposed to sell a total of Rbs1,000bn worth of Treasury
bills this year - compared with an expected budget deficit of several
thousand billion roubles.
She said two experimental auctions had already shown there would be demand
for the paper, but she was hoping the central bank would make it compulsory
for commercial banks to hold some of their reserves in the form of Treasury
bills.
Mr Kozlov has so far resisted making this compulsory.

FT  10 MAY 93 / International Company News: Moody's downgrades NEC debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOODY'S, the US credit rating agency, has downgraded the long-term debt
rating of NEC, citing expectations that the Japanese electronics group's
debt cover will deteriorate. The agency reduced its rating from A2 to A3.
NEC, a leading manufacturer of telecommunications, computers and
semiconductors, faces increasing competition in many of its markets, Moody's
said.
The group has seen the proportion of retained cash-flow to total debt fall
to about half over the past several years, while interest cover has fallen
from three times to about one and a half. The company is also forecasting a
substantial loss in the year to March 1993, so interest cover will fall
further.
In the Japanese PC market, which NEC has dominated with its proprietary
system, competition from US manufacturers is set to intensify with the
spread of MS-Windows.
This new operating system will loosen NEC's hold on the market by
challenging the predominance of its Japanese-language software that has been
maintained due to its propriety system.
In addition, the company faces increasing price competition from US
manufacturers, which will also erode its market share of over 50 per cent in
Japan, Moody's says.
In its semiconductor business, NEC is in a market where research and
development and capital investment continues to rise rapidly with each new
semiconductor generation, while profits from semiconductor sales continue to
decline.
Moody's has also downgraded NEC's short-term debt ratings and the rating of
NEC Industries Netherlands from P-1 to P-2.

THE Shanghai stock exchange has approved 23 foreign brokerage firms to deal
directly in its B-share market.
These are shares denominated in US dollars and restricted to foreigners.
Among the 23 approved securities houses are Merrill Lynch of the US, Credit
Lyonnais of France, Nomura International of Japan and Sun Hung Kai of Hong
Kong.
Mr Wu Yalun, deputy chief manager of the exchange, said the foreign
companies had been offered direct access - previously foreign securities
firms were obliged to deal through a local affiliate - to meet the growing
needs of overseas securities agen-cies.
Mr Wu said the presence of a foreign securities companies would make
transactions more competitive on the world market.
Trade in the B-share market has been flat recently, partly because foreign
investors have been awaiting the listing on the Hong Kong exchange of select
mainland compan-ies.
Reservations about a lax regulatory environment in China are one of the
factors deterring fund managers.

REISEBURO Kuoni, the Swiss travel group, said it looked forward to a
'relatively satisfactory' result in 1993.
The group, in which the German retailer Kaufhof purchased a 50.1 per cent
capital stake last year, reported that 1992 group sales rose by 13.9 per
cent to SFr2.46bn (Dollars 1.72bn) and net profits more than doubled to
SFr49.9m from SFr21.3m.
Mr Peter Oes, chief executive, said at the group's annual press conference
that Kuoni was discussing co-operation with Kaufhof's ITS travel subsidiary.
It has also been agreed that Kaufhof would select two of the group's seven
board members.
The Swiss Kuoni-Hugentobler Foundation, created by the group's founder,
holds a 52.6 per cent voting majority. Swissair sold its 35.8 per cent stake
in Kuoni last May.

FT  10 MAY 93 / International Company News: Indian Airlines chief quits
after row with ministry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIAN Airlines, the troubled state-owned carrier, has been thrown into
confusion by the sudden resignation at the weekend of Mr L. Vasudev, the
chairman and managing director.
Mr Vasudev's departure comes at a time when the airline has been widely
criticised for its records on safety and strikes, and its heavy financial
losses.
The immediate cause of Mr Vasudev's departure was a row between him and Mr
Ghulam Nabi Azad, the aviation minister. In a letter, Mr Vasudev accused the
ministry of 'systematically undermining' his role as chief executive.
Mr Vasudev took office only last July, when the chairmanship had been vacant
for more than six months following the resignation of his predecessor over
the handling of a pilots' strike in late 1991.
He also ran into trouble with the pilots who went on strike for higher pay
in December 1992 during the peak season for foreign tourists and business
travellers.
Mr Vasudev tried to break the strike by hiring Tupolev jets and crews from
Uzbekistan Airlines. He wished to instill commercially-minded management
practices into the airline, which is facing increasing competition from
fledgling private carriers.
The attempt collapsed when a Tupolev crashed in January at New Delhi
airport. No-one was seriously hurt, but the government forced the airline to
accept the pilots' demands.
However, in the last month, two Indian Airlines jets were hijacked,
prompting an investigation into security standards, and 53 passengers were
killed when another aircraft crashed at Aurangabad, in western India.
Accident investigators are examining whether the aircraft, an ageing Boeing
737, had been in fit condition to fly and whether it had been overloaded.
In his resignation letter, Mr Vasudev says the airline management's 'abject
surrender' in the strike led to 'rank indiscipline in the organisation' and
the 'greatest casualty of indiscipline' was safety.

FT  10 MAY 93 / International Company News: Altron ahead 11.5% at R103m

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALTRON, the diversified electronics, information technology and power cables
group, lifted attributable earnings in difficult operating conditions by
11.5 per cent to R103.3m (Dollars 32.68m) in the year to February from
R92.7m a year earlier.
The best relative performance came from Fintech, the information technology
arm, which lifted attributable earnings to R26.2m from R20m.
Powertech increased earnings by 7 per cent to R46.3m from R43.4m, but
Altech's earnings fell back slightly to R90m from R92m as an improved
operating performance was offset by lower interest income on cash balances
and a higher tax bill.
Group turnover edged ahead to R2.7bn from R2.6bn, but tough trading
conditions saw operating income fall to R281.2m from R294.5m. The dividend
was increased by 7 per cent to 170 cents from 159 cents last time.
Mr Bill Venter, executive chairman, said the group had made progress in
pursuing its policy of strategic acquisition while investing in new markets
and growth opportunities domestically and abroad.
Altron has acquired an investment in Alcatel Alsthom, the French
telecommunications systems manufacturer, which in turn has taken a 50 per
cent stake in Alcatel Altech Telecoms. This deal, and existing ties with the
Swiss ABB group, offers Altron entry to their markets.

bank bid
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANCO Santander, one of Spain's biggest private banks, has launched a
takeover bid for the 75 per cent of Portugal's Banco de Comercio e Industria
it does not already own, AP-DJ reports from Madrid.
A spokesman for Santander estimated the bid to be worth up to Pta18bn
(Dollars 155m).
Santander said the Portuguese bank's other overseas investors, the Royal
Bank of Scotland with 15 per cent and Metropolitan Life Insurance with 3.6
per cent, have approved its offer.
The Spanish bank will pay Esc1,400 (Dollars 9.53) a share for the bank, a 40
per cent premium over BCI's average share price in recent weeks. The bid
must be approved by the Portuguese authorities.
Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and BCI participate in a cross-border
computer network with Credit Comercial de France.
Santander and RBS also have a banking alliance, with the Spanish bank
holding 9.9 per cent of RBS and the Scottish bank holding a 2.5 per cent
stake in Santander.
Mr Jose Sevilla, a banking analyst with Madrid brokerage FG Inversiones
Bursatiles, said the move was in line with Santander's strategy in Portugal,
where they are 'pretty aggressive in terms of introducing new pro-ducts.'
Santander shares closed Pta10 down Friday at Pta5,060.
BCI operates in retail and investment banking, as well as corporate finance
and leasing activities. It has expanded strongly in the past two years,
increasing its branches to 86 from 25, with another 20 scheduled to open
this year.
Assets rose 36 per cent in 1992 to Pta295bn, while deposits rose 40 per cent
to Pta177.76bn.
Net profit in 1992 reached Pta1.73bn, Santander said, without giving a year
earlier figure.

Pounds 3.7m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JARVIS, the construction and property group, has reported a Pounds 3.72m
pre-tax loss for 1992 and announced a rights issue to raise Pounds 2.35m.
The issue of 18.07m new ordinary shares is on a one-for-one basis at 14p per
share. Proceeds will be used to improve liquidity and gearing and to prepare
the group for an expected recovery in its markets.
Irrevocable commitments to take up their entitlements have been received
from shareholders holding 29.7 per cent of the existing equity.
The year's loss, compared with a Pounds 238,000 profit, and reflected
problem contracts and redundancy and other closure costs, particularly
within the building division. Turnover came to Pounds 92.1m (Pounds 119.7m);
loss per share was 19.8p (earnings 0.8p) and the dividend has been omitted
(0.575p).
Jarvis also announced that its subsidiary, Jarvis Estates, had contracted to
sell for Pounds 1.05m two properties in Becontree and Darlington to Jarvis
Pensions, the trustee for the Jarvis Pension Scheme.
The rights issue has been underwritten by Mr Harvey Bard, the chairman and
fellow director Mr Martin Reuben.

FT  10 MAY 93 / International Company News: Drew Scientific valued at Pounds
25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DREW Scientific Group, which makes machines that allow doctors to monitor
the management of diabetes, is joining the rush for a market quotation.
It is set to join the stock market later this month through a placing of
some 30 per cent of its shares, putting a value on the whole of this
Chiswick-based group of about Pounds 25m.
Formed by Mr Keith Drew, a former submarine lieutenant in the Royal Navy,
the group has evolved in the last five years from work screening blood for
sickle-cell anaemia carried out with the Institute of Child Health, an
affiliate of Great Ormond Street Hospital.
The placing is expected to be priced at about 110p, to raise Pounds 7m, of
which Pounds 4m will be used for development of the group which has so far
grown from internally generated resources and a small overdraft.
Mr Drew and his family, which currently holds just over 50 per cent of the
shares, will raise Pounds 1.3m through share sales and will be left with
just under 30 per cent of the group.
In the year to March the group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 151,000 on
sales of Pounds 1.7m. It is currently producing 40 machines a month -
retailing at up to Pounds 15,000 - and the packs of consumables required for
each test, and could make profits of up to Pounds 2m, giving earnings per
share of 5.8p assuming a low tax charge.
The new issue precedes flotation of a similar diagnostic instrument company,
Anagen, due for mid-June although that is still developing its product and
has made no sales.
Drew Scientific's main product, the Glycomat, is an automated analytical
instrument capable of monitoring large numbers of blood samples. It is now
making instruments for a larger market that needs tests for the level of
glycated haemoglobin in blood.
So far Drew has sold only 275 machines. But it claims 'considerable
potential for rapid growth' after it received Food and Drug Administration
approval to sell in the US and launched its main Glycomat product there in
December.
Competition for the system comes from traditional electrophoresis methods,
which are much cheaper but also more time consuming. Other competition is
High Performance Liquid Chromatography, which unlike the Drew system
requires high pressures. The main producers of this are a Californian
company, Bio Rad, and Daiichi of Japan.
Drew has given worldwide distribution rights to Ciba-Corning, a subsidiary
of Ciba Geigy, and also European rights to IL of Milan.
Mr Drew says the group wanted a sounder base for development given the
intentions to market a new, smaller instrument to a wider market later in
the year.
It also needed to move from manufacturing 'cottage industry' style in
Chiswick to a full manufacturing base in Cumbria. 'We have done alright but
we have fresh markets to go for particularly in the US and in Japan,' Mr
Drew said.

FT  10 MAY 93 / International Company News: BIS returns to the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIS, the computing services group owned by Nynex Corporation of the US,
returned to profitability in 1992, with Pounds 8.7m at the operating level.
Revenues improved 7 per cent to Pounds 120.5m (Pounds 112.6m). In the
previous year there was a loss of Pounds 1m, the first one in the company's
recent history.
BIS is a complex group including computer software, consultancy, facilities
management and direct marketing interests, and it is best known for Midas, a
software package for international banks now used by 500 customers in 70
countries.
Some 46 per cent of total revenues come from banking software.
Mr Roger Graham, chairman and chief executive, said the turnround to profit
had been the result of cutting parts of the business that were unprofitable
and improving quality and customer satisfaction.
There had been strong growth in sales to local and central government and to
utilities. The group intended to compete strongly for a share in the
government's market testing programme, Mr Graham said.

FT  10 MAY 93 / International Company News: Radiotrust value starts picking
up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reflecting the continuing difficult trading conditions, net asset value of
Radiotrust at January 31 had fallen to 48.3p, compared with 49.9p six
months' earlier and with 50.2p at end-January 1992.
Since then, however, it had edged upwards as signs of the ending of the
recession had begun to appear, the directors said.
In the year ended January 31 1993 income totalled Pounds 113,000 (Pounds
127,000) but there was a net loss of Pounds 22,000 (Pounds 26,000), equal to
0.25p (0.3p) per share.
The current year promised to be 'more stimulating' than the last two as the
recession faded and advertising revenues began to climb, the directors
claimed.

For the year 1992 Cooper Clarke, builders' merchant and distributor of
specialised products, made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 203,000 from Pounds
23.6m turnover.
The 1991 period was for eight months only, and that produced a profit of
Pounds 126,000 from sales of Pounds 13.2m.
Mr Peter Clarke, chairman, said the company had been hit by bad debts of
Pounds 316,000 in the year despite close control of credit management.
Intense competition again squeezed margins.
After a substantially higher tax charge earnings per share for the year came
to 2.6p (4.1p for the period).

FT  10 MAY 93 / International Company News: Revamped Maddox over Pounds 1m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER returning to the black at midway, Maddox Group finished the 1992 year
with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.13m from turnover of Pounds 24m. Included
in the profit was a Pounds 491,000 exceptional credit.
In the second half Cables and Flexibles and Seacoast Electric suffered a
significant reduction in activity and substantially poorer results than
expected. Hence the decision to sell them.
Wakebourne Group, the computer and maintenance support business acquired
last August, matched expectations and made significant contributions to
profits.
Operating profit before central costs came to Pounds 1.36m. Wakebourne
accounted for Pounds 906,000, C&amp;F Pounds 387,000 and Seacoast Pounds 223,000
for the period March to September, and other businesses incurred losses of
Pounds 155,000.
Earnings per share came to 0.39p, against losses of 1.43p in the previous
nine months on a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 311,000.
Assuming shareholders approve the sale of C&amp;F and Seacoast the main business
of the group in 1993 will be focused on the information technology support
sector.
In the first four months of 1993 Wakebourne's profits were ahead of budget,
and Computer Profiles, a UNIX based systems development business acquired in
February, was already contributing to group performance.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EIT Group, the USM-quoted information technology company formerly known as
Maxiprint, has been placed into administration.
Mr Michael Radford and Mr Paul Barratt, both of Radford, Sons &amp; Co, were
appointed joint administrators of the company by the High Court on Friday
under the provisions of the Insolvency Act 1986.
EIT's shares were suspended at 9 1/2 p in February pending clarification of
its financial position.
Earlier in the day the group, which has been hard hit by continued
rationalisation costs at Sintrom, reported a sharp increase in pre-tax
losses from Pounds 99,000 to Pounds 950,000 for the half year ended
September 30 1992.
Trading in the period had been 'satisfactory' taking into account the
economic climate, the directors said. The group supplies and supports
computer software for communications systems.
With the benefit of acquisitions turnover went up from Pounds 1.25m to
Pounds 8.6m, but operating expenses outweighed the gross surplus for an
operating deficit of Pounds 670,000 (Pounds 74,000).
Losses per share were 3p (1.05p).

FT  10 MAY 93 / International Company News: Ossory talks may lead to
restructure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OSSORY Estates, the property group, is negotiating with its 30 banks for a
new medium term loan agreement embracing all of its Pounds 100m of debt, and
that could lead to a capital reconstruction and the raising of fresh
capital.
That would take the business forward and back to profitability, the
directors claimed.
Several banks are being asked to convert non-performing debt into equity.
Since the breaches of bank covenants arose last September the company has
ensured no bank has pursued its security.
Part of the reconstruction would include creditors in the Skelmersdale
concourse project converting their debt into equity. Ossory lost the High
Court action regarding the fire there, and creditors for Pounds 4m will not
be reimbursed by the insurers but become a direct liability of the group.
In the half year ended December 31 1992 the group incurred a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 17.4m, against a profit of Pounds 1.52m. At the operating level, the
group achieved a substantial reduction in overheads and tackled several
inherent management problems.
However, Pounds 8.54m has been provided against property values and Pounds
5m for extraordinary interest costs to cover converting the fixed rate
preference shares into a variable rate instrument. But that was potentially
recoverable.
Losses per share were 21.82p (0.63p).
In the year 1991-92 the group wrote Pounds 42.7m off investments and
properties, and finished with a loss of Pounds 41.6m.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Berisford in profit after three years of losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERISFORD International, the property and agribusiness group which on Friday
saw its Pounds 184m offer for C&amp;J Clark turned down by the shoe company's
shareholders, will today announce a return to profits after three years of
losses. It is likely to reiterate plans to buy other businesses.
Interim results are not likely to include the costs of the abortive offer
for Clarks. These are thought to be well under Pounds 1m, with many
advisers' fees geared to success.
Clarks' costs may be much higher. Its merchant bank, Schroders, held a
full-scale international auction for the company approaching more than 40
possible bidders after shareholders agreed last October to seek a buyer.
Schroders, whose position has been questioned after Friday's shareholder
vote to keep the group independent, said yesterday it foresaw a continuing
relationship with Clarks.
Questions hang over the future of Clarks' chairman, Mr Walter Dickson, and
six other directors. Attempts to oust Mr Dickson last October could be
repeated, although on Friday shareholders promised to end the disharmony
which has bedevilled the company.
Berisford is expected to show a small pre-tax profit for the six months to
end-March. This is thought to have come from asset sales rather than
trading. Operations are likely to have shown a small loss.
In the comparable period, Berisford lost Pounds 57.4m before tax on an FRS 3
basis, after Pounds 49.2m of provisions.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Economics Notebook: Upbeat Gaidar sees minds won over by
reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yegor Gaidar, the former Russian prime minister, concluded three lectures
at the London School of Economics last week with an upbeat message which
left his audience of economists, academics and businessmen with the
impression that Russia has found a new Stolypin.
'If we can maintain political stability, Russia will continue to be a very
poor country into the 21st century. But it will also be one of the most
dynamically developing markets in the world, in which western businessmen
will fail to participate at their peril,' the 36-year-old economist and
former journalist predicted in his fluent but heavily accented English.
With the slogan 'order, then reform' Pyotr Stolypin, Russia's last great
reforming prime minister, picked up the pieces after the failed 1905
revolution. He set out to create a prosperous peasantry and a stable middle
class and so underpin Russia's transformation into a modern, constitutional
monarchy. Tragically, he died from an assassin's bullet in 1911.
Russia's current reformers faced a similar task as they sought to fill the
vacuum created by the failure of the August 1991 attempt to restore the old
Soviet power structure. They moved to cut bloated military spending by 70
per cent, started to tackle an inflationary monetary overhang and opted for
rapid mass privatisation as the main instrument of socio-economic
transformation.
Stolypin, whose readiness to jail or execute violent opponents led to the
gallows being nicknamed the 'Stolypin necktie', took a tough line with those
in the way of his reforms. By contrast, Mr Gaidar explained how Russia's
post-coup reform team went out of their way to bring opponents round and
argued that privatisation in particular must be drafted to benefit all its
potential opponents.
What that meant in practice, he told his LSE audience, was a mass
privatisation programme that allocated shares to enterprise managers and the
work collectives directly involved, as well as to power centres such as
local governments, security forces and teachers with the passive power to
block any reform.
'We have created a new social basis behind our economic policy and this in
my view is the reason for our success in the referendum. Life has changed in
the ordinary Russian city. People are suffering from higher prices and
corruption and face the prospect of rising unemployment. But there are
enormous opportunities, especially for the young and energetic, to earn good
money. People no longer have to travel 1,000km to Moscow to buy a terrible
salami sausage, or wait hours in line for bread, milk or meat. They can even
buy luxuries which they never imagined would appear in their shops - like
bananas,' he said.
This is the optimistic, post-referendum perspective. The picture looked less
rosy last December when Mr Gaidar, identified as the arch-reformer by
conservatives, was sacrificed by President Boris Yeltsin to quieten the
baying of the anti-reform lobby.
Mr Gaidar's explanation for what went wrong harked back to the previous
spring and summer when Russia had been hit by a flood of easy credits issued
by Ukraine. This recreated all the old financial imbalances and created a
near universal opposition to reform and a universal demand for the printing
of more money.
The reformers got close to restoring confidence in the rouble in early 1992,
by eliminating the inherited budget deficit of nearly 20 per cent of GDP.
But the lack of customs posts and tax collectors and inability to control
the spending of republics like Ukraine inside the rouble zone sparked off a
flood of money from the Russian central bank to bail out Russian
enterprises, he explained.
In December, Mr Gaidar was replaced as prime minister by Mr Viktor
Chernomyrdin, a typical Soviet era enterprise manager, and the flow of easy
credits to enterprises resumed. At this point, Mr Gaidar explained, all that
remained of the reform programme was the momentum behind the privatisation
programme and the determination of the reformers still in the government to
try to regain control over the money supply.
Four months later, however, the referendum vote showed strong support for
continuing the reforms. Mr Gaidar believes the result shows that the close
relationship between easy credit and higher prices is now better understood.
He also believes that the start of the biggest mass privatisation programme
ever seen has swung many enterprise managers and sceptical workers into the
reform camp.
'The change of attitude has been dramatic,' he said. 'Last spring factory
managers combined against the government, clamouring for easy credit. By
autumn there was a clear divide between those nostalgic for the old days of
easy credit and state orders and the younger, more energetic managers who
saw their future as the heads of big private companies, competing with
western companies and enjoying a high standard of living.'
As for workers, he added, 'they used to complain about high prices and low
wages. By September they were asking what should we do with our vouchers and
is the management plan for the future of our factory sensible, or are they
fooling us?'
The reformers initial success in cutting the budget deficit and pursuading
the central bank to raise interest rates showed it was possible to change
from soft-budget constraints and supply shortages to a demand determined
economy facing hard budget constraints.
Mr Gaidar's insider account, drawn from memory and delivered without notes,
underlined the parallels between the window of opportunity opened up by the
failed coup of August 1991 and the new opportunity to take reform further
which has opened up in the wake of last month's referendum.
Enriched by the mass of compressed experience since the collapse of the
Soviet Union and made wiser by the mistakes committed, the reformers are
again seeking to wrest the initiative. Among their targets - to regain
control of the money supply, raise energy prices to world levels, and bring
Yegor Gaidar back into the team.

FT  10 MAY 93 / City fails to master the enemy within: Richard Waters and
Norma Cohen find suspicions of insider deals are rarely proved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSIDER dealing is like sex. To hear some people in the financial world
talk, everyone else is doing it all of the time - except you.
In fact, no one has any idea how common (or uncommon) the crime really is.
As Mr Peter Gerrard, general counsel at the London Stock Exchange, says:
'That's part of the problem. It makes it easy for anyone to stand on a
soapbox and talk about it.'
Jumping on the soapbox last week was Mr Paul Myners, chairman of UK fund
manager Gartmore. In one of the City's periodic outpourings of angst on the
subject, he wrote to the Financial Times to complain about a sharp drop in
the share price of Tiphook, the transport rental group, in the days before
the company issued a profits warning. On previous experience, he said, it
was unlikely the Stock Exchange would be able to do anything about it.
Other fund managers queued up to agree with him. Several pointed to the
cases of MTM, the chemicals company, and BM Group, the construction
equipment company, both of whose shares collapsed spectacularly last year
after having fallen suspiciously sharply in the days before bad news was
announced.
Some claim the Stock Exchange lacks the will to police its members, or is
too passive. 'Most insider dealing is done by stockbrokers,' said one
shareholder, adding that the self-regulatory nature of the exchange meant it
could not take the tough action necessary to root out and punish insider
dealing.
The Stock Exchange, the body primarily responsible for detecting the crime,
denies the charges, but agrees it has been hampered in its fight against the
crime. A private body with powers only over its members, the exchange has
limited access to information. Department of Trade and Industry inspectors,
to whom the exchange refers cases it has assembled, have greater powers, for
instance, to require witnesses to answer questions.
'The gap comes where we don't have the powers needed to gather sufficient
information for inspectors to be appointed,' said Mr Mike Feltham, head of
the exchange's insider dealing group. A central agency  - perhaps the
Securities and Investments Board - should be invested with all the powers
and resources necessary to do the job, he says.
The exchange's complaints have fallen on deaf ears at the Treasury, where an
official said: 'It is very easy to come up with panaceas - an insider
dealing tribunal, a change in the burden of proof, a new central agency. But
the central difficulty is to establish that someone actually possessed
inside information. It is easy to have the suspicion.'
On this point, all agree. The rumours that sweep the stock market can take
share prices up or down sharply. 'A lot of those movements are market
manipulation rather than insider dealing,' says David Rough, investment
director at Legal and General. Many other cases are prompted by speculation.
Finding the evidence that a suspect actually dealt on inside information has
defeated many potential prosecutions in the past.
The Treasury has decided not to use the opportunity presented by the
implementation of the EC's Insider Dealing Directive in UK law to step up
the fight against insider dealing. Prompted by the EC directive, the new
legislation, included in the Criminal Justice Bill, may make a marginal
difference to the fight against the crime: the need for prosecutors to
establish a 'connection' between the insider dealer and the company whose
shares are traded will be abolished, for instance. However, the Treasury's
draft legislation on insider dealing, which will land on the desks of City
trade associations this morning, will do nothing to tackle the problems of
enforcement about which investors like Mr Myners complain.
Despite the soul-searching in the financial world, it seems likely that some
forms of insider dealing are declining. Even after it became a crime in
1980, trading on inside information remained an institutionalised practice
in securities houses, and brokers were valued most for their well-timed
tips, not their analysis. The well-publicised insider dealing cases of the
late 1980s in the US and UK changed all that, prompting securities and
investment management firms to introduce and enforce tougher dealing rules
on their staff.
Also, companies and their advisers are coming under greater pressure to keep
information secret, and to publish price-sensitive information promptly.
The exchange says it has become concerned at the leaking of information to
Sunday newspapers and has called in a number of chairmen of listed companies
in recent months. These tickings-off have been done the way the City likes
best - in secret - but the exchange threatens it may make cases public in
future.
Despite this, listed companies still like to prepare the market for bad
information. 'Companies call it news management,' said the head of UK
equities at one leading fund management house. 'They don't exactly say
'We're issuing a profits warning.' They just give you enough information to
realise the profits estimates of most analysts are too high.'
A shareholder said that in one such meeting with the management of a major
international food group last autumn, he realised that the company was
likely to take write-downs at year-end which had not yet been factored into
analysts' profit forecasts. As a result, he held off buying a further stake
in the company.
Prompter publication to the market as a whole would keep insider dealing at
bay, whether real or suspected. The slide in the Tiphook share price came in
the days after the company had told its broker, UBS, that it planned to
issue the profit warning, but before the warning was announced. The longer
price-sensitive information sits around the offices of a company or its
advisers, the more likely it is to leak.
The conviction in March of Mr Thorold Mackie, the Edinburgh-based
stockbroker fined for advising his clients to trade in the shares of Shanks
&amp; McEwan, also sprung in part from a delay in publication. He was told of a
possible profits warning at the company two weeks before it was published to
the stock market.
As the Treasury official says: 'More pressure should be put on companies to
get information out to the market quickly.' And a fund manager adds: 'The
minute a material development is known, the company should be required to
disclose it to all shareholders.' After all, if there was less inside
information, there would be less insider dealing.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Wood seeks to swap pay for RBS equity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Wood, the director of the Royal Bank of Scotland, who is likely to
earn more than Pounds 10m this year from the growth of its Direct Line
insurance operation, is considering offering to swap his pay bonus contract
for equity in the bank.
A swap of the contract, which links his annual performance bonus to the
asset growth of Direct Line, could make him one of Royal Bank's largest
individual shareholders, with a stake of up to 2 per cent of its ordinary
shares. Last year Mr Wood's bonus accounted for Pounds 6,014,000 of his
total emoluments of Pounds 6,121,290.
Mr Wood said in an interview with the Financial Times that he hoped to enter
talks with the bank before its September year-end on a buy-out of his
contract, agreed in 1988 when he sold it his 25 per cent stake in Direct
Line.
If Mr Wood exchanged his bonus contract for Royal Bank equity, it would
diminish speculation that he will press for a separate flotation of the
Direct Line business, which he founded in 1985 with financial backing from
the bank.
Mr Wood already holds more shares of Royal Bank than any of its other board
directors. He had a stake of 334,610 ordinary shares at the end of 1992,
which is worth Pounds 893,400 at the bank's share price of 267p on Friday.
Mr Wood said he could not predict the outcome of talks, but he believed his
bonus contract was worth between 1 and 2 per cent of Royal Bank's Pounds
2.1bn market capitalisation, which would give him a stake of between Pounds
21m and Pounds 42m.
He said he believed there would still be larger family shareholdings in
Royal Bank. The biggest institutional holders in 1992 were Banco de
Santander, with 9.89 per cent, and Scottish Equitable Life Assurance, with
5.24 per cent.
Mr Wood said he was keen to change his contract because the fact that he was
getting cash in return for giving up Direct Line meant his pay arrangement
was 'distorted' and attracted public attention he would prefer to avoid.
Although there has been speculation over whether Mr Wood fits comfortably
into Royal Bank, he said he was happy to work with its chief executive Mr
George Mathewson, and it was now logical to consider alternatives to
flotation.
Direct Line was last week disclosed to have trebled first-half profits to
Pounds 15m.

FT  10 MAY 93 / UK's late-payment culture attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK BUSINESSES face greater delays in the payment of bills than many of their
Continental European counterparts as companies put short-term financial
advantage before contractual obligations, according to a study released
today.
The UK's record for paying bills between 15 and 60 days late is 'notably
worse' than in France, Italy, Belgium or the Netherlands, says the study
undertaken by Manchester Business School for National Westminster Bank.
The research underlined the problems for small businesses from late payment,
which have intensified during the recession.
Late payment, says the study, 'is a demonstration that the business culture
ranks monetary gain above ethical behaviour.'
The Federation of Small Businesses, which has 58,000 members, said last
night that late payment of bills had taken a serious toll on companies
across the country.
Mr Tony Miller, the federation's financial affairs chairman, said: 'Clients
are constantly having to chase accounts and we are now seeing companies
being paid in instalments to spread the cost. It has grown much worse during
the recession.'
The report cast doubt on the assumption that the problem of late payment is
inflicted by large companies on small suppliers. Although the finances of
small companies suffer disproportionately from late payment, they are no
better than large companies in paying bills promptly.
'Large companies may well be late payers, but small and medium-sized
enterprises are at least as bad and probably worse,' the report says.
The study supported a proposal, which has been backed by the Forum of
Private Business, a small business lobby group, for legislation to give
companies a statutory right to interest on unpaid bills.
It also called for a reduction in credit periods, which it said would
improve the cashflow of many UK companies. It said that small manufacturers
and wholesalers would gain from shorter credit periods. Payment Practices,

FT  10 MAY 93 / Balladur prepares to impose tax-raising budget on France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR EDOUARD Balladur, the French prime minister, will today put his stamp on
economic policy with a special budget aimed at stemming the rising budget
deficit by raising taxes. He will also seek to boost the stalled economy
through selective public works spending.
After only five weeks in office, Mr Balladur is using his political
honeymoon to impose unpopular tax increases on an electorate which voted
massively for a centre-right platform that spoke of fiscal sacrifice only in
very general terms.
A cabinet meeting today will also table plans to make the French central
bank independent, another election promise. The aim is to curb political
interference in the exercise of monetary policy and reduce the likelihood of
fresh speculative attacks against the franc.
The government-ordered audit of state finances last week paved the way for
budgetary austerity. It estimated that, without corrective action, the
central budget deficit would rise from FFr226bn (Pounds 27bn) last year to
around FFr340bn this year. The separate welfare funds for unemployment,
health, pensions and family allowances could end this year some FFr135bn in
the red.
The overwhelming reason for the slide in public finances is the slowdown in
the economy which, the audit commission estimated, could contract by about
0.5 per cent this year. There has also been a consequent rise in
unemployment to 10.7 per cent.
The most controversial measure is expected to be a rise in the 'general
social contribution' (CSG) from 1.1 per cent to 2.4 per cent on salaries,
bringing in a gross FFr20bn this year.
Mr Balladur apparently believes a CSG hike would do less harm to economic
growth than raising value added tax. But in deference to conservative
distaste for the CSG, introduced by the Socialists, he may make the
increased payment deductible from income tax. The equivalent of excise tax
on petrol and alcohol is also expected to rise.
Mr Balladur is expected to confirm today that the period during which
individuals contribute to full state pensions is to be lengthened gradually
from 37 1/2 to 40 years, another unpopular move.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, minister of the economy, said in an interview with the
Financial Times that the budget would take initial steps towards giving
individuals a tax break on their long-term savings. He said this, in
addition to the effect of recent short-term interest rate cuts, would
encourage the flow of money into the stock market, essential to his
ambitious privatisation programme.
Mr Balladur has promised to pare spending by FFr20bn, with cuts expected to
fall on defence and education.
Some of this saving will be used to provide tax incentives for the
beleaguered construction industry and to finance public housing.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Nadir seeks to recover assets: Move to regain businesses
will create problems for Polly Peck administrators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN, ROBERT RICE, ANDREW JACK and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ASIL NADIR, the former chairman of Polly Peck International who jumped
bail last Tuesday to return to his native northern Cyprus, says he plans to
fly to Turkey to reclaim the remnants of his business empire.
Mr Nadir told reporters over the weekend he would go to the Turkish mainland
'sooner than you think'. This would create new difficulties for Polly Peck
administrators attempting to recover assets. Mr Nadir appears to be planning
court action to regain control of his various Turkish business interests.
Such a move could also place strains on Britain's diplomatic relationship
with Turkey, as the UK government continues to apply pressure for Mr Nadir's
return from northern Cyprus.
Administrators of Polly Peck at accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand confirmed that
Mr Nadir's flight to northern Cyprus had delayed two disposals of group
companies worth Dollars 30m (Pounds 19m) after Turkish and Cypriot buyers
pulled out because of uncertainty surrounding his intentions.
Mr Michael Jordan, a joint administrator, flew to Istanbul on Thursday in an
attempt to steer through the sale of Polly Peck's shareholding in Meyna, a
fruit company based in Turkey and northern Cyprus, and the sale of the
Cypriot pharmaceutical company ICP. A spokesman for Coopers said: 'At best
we can say that since Mr Nadir's flight the sales are on hold.'
In a telephone interview with Sir David Frost on BBC television yesterday,
Mr Nadir repeated his criticisms of his treatment in the UK and reiterated a
promise to compensate shareholders in Polly Peck for their losses. He said
he was hoping to offer 'a very pleasant surprise' to Polly Peck shareholders
but refused to elaborate.
If Mr Nadir travels to mainland Turkey he could risk being extradited.
Britain has said it will seek his extradition, but Home Office officials
played down the chances of a successful application to the Turkish
authorities.
Under the UK's treaty with Turkey, neither country is obliged to extradite
its own nationals. A spokesman said it was possible the Turks might not
treat Mr Nadir as immune because he has dual Turkish and Cypriot
nationality, but 'that is a question for them'.
The precise size of Mr Nadir's Turkish and Cypriot business empire is
unclear. Mr Mentesh Aziz, Mr Nadir's personal lawyer, has estimated Mr
Nadir's personal wealth at Pounds 20m to Pounds 25m.
Mr Aziz said yesterday that according to records in northern Cyprus, Mr
Nadir is still a director of the local PPI companies. These include Sunzest,
the fruit business, Unipac, the packaging plant, and three hotels - the Palm
Beach, the Jasmine Court and the Crystal Cove, although these are thought to
be leased from the northern Cyprus government.
The administrators estimate the total book value of the northern Cyprus
assets, including parts of Meyna and ICP, at about Dollars 40m. In Turkey,
Mr Nadir may try to regain Gunaydin, the Istanbul newspaper.

FT  10 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Greencore
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Irish government's shareholding in Greencore may now have been placed,
but the episode highlights the sadly familiar episode of an aggressive
stockbroker's excessive ambition. The Irish government wanted the job to go
to a national broker for political reasons. Astonishingly, no one stopped to
consider Greencore's 15 per cent ownership limit which would automatically
be exceeded if Davy failed to get the issue away and was stuck with shares.
But Greencore is little known outside Ireland and Davy has limited
experience dealing with international investors. While telling the market
the 25m shares were placed, it was forced to take 4.45m of them on to the
books of associated investors.
The Irish stock exchange is understandably concerned about a possible false
market in Greencore's shares and has rightly launched an investigation. If
the affair reflects badly on Davy, it is more surprising that a house with
the skills and reputation of Warburg should have allowed itself to be
dragged into the controversy. Warburg agreed to take on 2.54m of the
unplaced Greencore shares in its capacity as underwriter but seems to have
been uncharacteristically lax in not keeping abreast of how the placing was
going. Thus it was caught by surprise when the trouble blew up. That is not
what one would expect of the super-smooth mastermind behind BT3.

FT  10 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: SE Banken
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sentiment has certainly changed towards Swedish banks. Shares in SE Banken
have virtually quadrupled to SKr27 since their low on April 22. Last week
the excitement became so intense that the bank had to bring forward
first-quarter results showing a 60 per cent increase in operating profits.
The strength of operating income is gratifying since, in theory at least, it
demonstrates the scope for recovery once the crisis finally abates. That
does not mean, though, that progress will henceforth be linear.
Among the factors bolstering operating income were several that may not
last. Sharp swings in the Swedish money market enabled the bank to widen its
interest margin; market turbulence boosted foreign exchange trading profits;
commission income was helped by a strong stock market. The harder part will
be to maintain the momentum when these factors subside. It is not as if the
recession is over. The need for provisions may continue awhile.
The tantalising possibility is that SE Banken's improved fortunes may limit
its need for state assistance to rebuild its capital. Worries that such help
would not come without cost to shareholders have held back the price.
Handelsbanken has managed without state aid and now trades at a discount of
only 25 per cent to book. SE Banken's discount of around 45 per cent
suggests more room for recovery. Until the shape of the government rescue
package is decided, there is no telling how far existing shareholders will
be the beneficiaries.

FT  10 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Vodafone
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sound of chirruping cellular phones is a sure if irritating sign of
economic spring, and Vodafone's most recent connection figures seem to
confirm that winter is over. New subscribers have been joining the network
at an accelerating rate, both to the new Low Call tariff structure and at
the traditional business rates. The low rate of migration from business to
Low Call is also encouraging. Some 30-40 per cent of its customers would be
better off on Low Call: less than 10 per cent have transferred.
That lack of price sensitivity could be important as the market becomes more
competitive. Mercury is about to launch its mass market mobile system within
the M25 at prices significantly below the existing cellular operators.
Tactically it makes sense for Vodafone to cede market share to the new
entrant until it has much wider coverage. If Low Call is any guide, the
erosion may be slow, so Vodafone's high margins may survive for some time.
Market growth from economic recovery may also help keep earnings moving.
For longer-term protection Vodafone has been reinvesting its surplus cash
flow in overseas licences. The key to profits in all these markets, however,
will be the rate at which the price of technology - and hence capital
expenditure on new networks - falls, balanced against restrictions on new
entrants and the conservatism of consumers. Vodafone is winning the
short-term battle with consumers. Whether that will be enough to prevent the
kind of carnage collapsing prices have caused in the personal computer
market remains to be seen.

FT  10 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: A short-sighted policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At first glance the US Treasury's decision to switch its borrowings from
long-dated bonds to short-term bills and notes appears sensible enough.
Currently two-year money at 3.75 per cent looks much cheaper than 30-year
bonds at over 6.75 per cent. The US Treasury estimates that the change will
save Dollars 1.6bn in 1994 and a total of around Dollars 16bn by 1998.
Short-term rates are, however, volatile and once recovery gathers pace the
administration could see its cost of funds rising rapidly. As bond yields
would also start to rise the government is in danger of missing its
opportunity to fund the deficit at the lowest long-term rates available for
a generation.
This policy switch also puts the Federal Reserve in an invidious position,
since as soon as it feels the need to tighten monetary policy it will worsen
the government's fiscal plight. The bind would be all the tighter because,
as loan demand picks up, banks will start to liquidate their substantial
holdings of short-term government debt. Treasury yields may thus rise faster
than general interest rates. In theory borrowing short-term money imposes an
extra discipline on the government by making inflation - and therefore
short-term rates - more punitive. Politicians, however, rarely respond to
such pressures.
Meanwhile long-term bonds will become less liquid. The market's focus will
shift towards 10-year maturities as a benchmark, upsetting the stripped
coupon market. The loss of seven-year issues could cause ructions in the
interest rate swap, while the bond futures tail may also increasingly wag
the cash market dog. The market's response was thus understandably cautious
 -all the more so because the administration's action smacks of displacement
activity to avoid tackling the underlying budget deficit.

senior politicians implicated in the widening scandal.
The move to challenge parliament over the immunity of Mr Bettino Craxi, the
former Socialist leader, and Mr Severino Citaristi, former administrative
secretary for the Christian Democrat party, brings to a head a simmering
conflict between the judiciary and the legislature.
It came as Mr Mario Segni, leader of the country's referendum movement,
threw the discredited party political framework into further disarray by
announcing the creation of a new party to contest general elections expected
later this year.
At the same time Mr Giuliano Amato, until last month the Socialist prime
minister, suggested the creation of a new centre-left group which could
embrace former Socialists and members of other centre parties.
Last month the chamber of deputies, the lower house of parliament,
authorised the lifting of Mr Craxi's immunity on only two of the six
requests made by Milan magistrates. A month earlier the senate, the upper
house of parliament, voted similarly in relation to Mr Citaristi, whose
immunity was lifted only on the least serious of magistrates' requests.
Magistrates will appeal against both decisions, taking the corruption
investigation into largely uncharted constitutional territory.
The magistrates, who believe Mr Craxi could be indicted within two months on
the allegations on which investigations have been authorised, argue that
parliament exceeded its rights in rejecting the other requests.
The corruption investigations, meanwhile, produced leaked testimony from Mr
Antonio Mosconi, a senior Fiat group executive detained earlier this year,
according to which Mr Cesare Romiti, Fiat's chief executive, was allegedly
aware of payments to politicians through foreign bank accounts well before
the date previously indicated.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Taking chances for peace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While the attention of the US and Europe is focused on the former states of
Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, the Middle East peace process is suffering.
Eighteen months after the inaugural meeting in Madrid, the five teams of
negotiators have yet to report progress on any matters of substance, no
sense of momentum has developed, and the enemies of compromise are gaining
strength.
Optimism stems mainly from the fact that talks are continuing, and no
participant wishes to bear the responsibility for ending the process. But
there is increasing recognition among the Arab delegations and among US
officials that domestic pressures on the participants could eventually
impose a breaking point. This is particularly the case for the Palestinians.
Whatever misjudgements and lost opportunities can be blamed on them in the
past, they have come to the negotiating table essentially as supplicants.
Much of what was demanded of the Palestine Liberation Organisation by the
international community has been conceded. Mr Yassir Arafat is a pale shadow
of the man who once ruled part of Lebanon and dreamed of the military
liberation of Palestine. Syria has retained more of its political clothing,
but it, too, has been forced to accept that it will only regain the Golan
Heights, which it lost in 1967, by negotiating a full peace with Israel.
Jordan and Lebanon acknowledge that their outstanding issues with Israel can
only be resolved in the context of an agreement between Israel, the Syrians
and the Palestinians.
Take the risks
It is understandably difficult for Israel to adjust to the enormity of those
changes, precisely because it is the Jewish state which has to take the
risks involved in testing the sincerity of its Arab neighbours. It is
tempting for a cautious political leadership to conclude that the diminution
of the military threat to Israel allows it to be less forthcoming at the
negotiating table. That certainly was the view of the last Likud government
under Mr Yitzhak Shamir. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, his Labour successor as prime
minister, appeared to promise much more. He campaigned on the pledge to
secure an interim agreement with the Palestinians within nine months and his
senior colleagues stressed their willingness to withdraw from Gaza, most of
the West Bank and most, possibly all, of Golan.
Under occupation
The collapse of Mr Rabin's timetable can be explained by his excessive
caution, the limitations of coalition government, and the obvious fact that
the peace process does not exist in a Washington vacuum. The Palestinian
negotiators and their families live under occupation. Their legitimacy as
leaders rests on their ability to ease living conditions in the territories,
and in moving towards Palestinian self-determination. This has so far been
denied to them in negotiations giving their radical opponents, essentially
Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the chance to set the political agenda.
Mr Rabin's expulsion of over 400 Palestinians and the more recent closure of
the occupied territories, which has cost 100,000 people the opportunity to
work, were radical responses to Israeli public concern over worsening
violence. But the impact of those actions was also to intensify unrest
within the territories, boost the standing of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and
make it extremely difficult for the Palestinian negotiators to return to
Washington.
It has to be in the long-term interests of Israel and the moderate
Palestinian majority to reverse this trend as quickly as possible. Israel's
decision to permit the return of 30 Palestinians expelled before 1987 is a
step in the right direction. Easing restrictions on the West Bank and Gaza
would further help. But there is no substitute for offering the Palestinians
a great deal more than the chance to carry out some administrative functions
under the existing regulations affecting the occupied territories. By
refusing to make any offer which might be interpreted as opening the door to
an independent state, Israel is limiting the scope of negotiations to the
point where even the most moderate Palestinians could find it impossible to
continue. If Mr Rabin is really serious about taking chances for peace, the
moment to demonstrate it is now.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Lifting the lid on liberalisation: Andrew Adonis and Andrew
Hill examine European Commission plans to open up the telecommunications
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When European Community telecommunications ministers sit down today in
Brussels for their first discussion of plans to open all EC telephone calls
to competition, they will agree on one thing: liberalisation of the Ecu110bn
(Pounds 87bn) market for telecoms services is inevitable.
Technological advances, pressure from powerful non-EC operators, the advent
of the single market, the influence of privatisation and other measures to
distance telecoms monopolies from governments are making the process
virtually irresistible.
Acceptance of the goal of liberalisation is already a great change of heart
for many governments and state telecoms monopolies, nervous about the
destabilising forces such a move might unleash.
Only two years ago, France, Belgium, Spain and Italy were mounting
unsuccessful challenges to the Commission's powers to liberalise the markets
for telecoms equipment and specialised services in the European Court of
Justice. Mr Michel Carpentier, head of the Commission's telecoms
directorate, says even those early achievements would have been
inconceivable when he took over the department in 1983.
Now, those same countries are looking sympathetically at a Commission plan
which would allow private operators - including non-EC operators, provided
they open their own markets to competition - to compete within EC states on
equal terms with the former telecoms monopolies.
Although the goal of open competition is all but agreed, the path ahead is
littered with obstacles. As Mr Carpentier says: 'I don't know a member state
or an operator which has said we shouldn't liberalise. The question is when,
and how.'
For the Commission, the answer to the first part of the question is
relatively simple: January 1 1998. That is the date set in its recent
communication to telecoms ministers for full liberalisation of all telecoms
services, including international and domestic telephone calls. Talks with
130 companies, regulators, national governments and users convinced the
Commission that an intermediate step - opening all EC cross-border calls to
competition - would be superfluous.
Instead, over the next three years the Commission wants to:
accelerate adoption of existing technical proposals, which would liberalise
satellite communications and lay the groundwork for licensing and granting
fair access to new telecoms operators; study how alternative networks, such
as cable television, railways, or electricity grids, could be used for
telecoms services;
study the thorny issue of allowing companies to establish their own networks
to compete with the existing infrastructure.
These measures should open the way, over the following two years, for the
Commission to press for full liberalisation of the market for 'voice'
traffic using existing infrastructure.
Further liberalisation would then depend on the outcome of the Commission's
studies, but rapid expansion and diversification of the telecoms market will
provide a momentum of its own. A recent survey of the industry by Daiwa
Institute of Research predicted that telecoms would be 'Europe's fastest
growing major industry in the 1990s', with annual growth averaging 8.5 per
cent and the sector constituting 4.5 per cent of gross domestic product by
2000 - twice the 1991 figure.
It is too early for a stand-off over the proposals in today's council. But
when the scrapping begins, as it is bound to, the UK will be the most
pro-liberal party, gleaning some support from Denmark and the Netherlands.
The Danes, who should begin to liberalise their telecoms services next year
and hold the EC's presidency until July, are keen to push the legislative
process along. They have already scheduled a second meeting of telecoms
ministers for June 16, at which they hope a formal resolution can be adopted
backing the Commission's framework plans.
France, Belgium and Germany are more cautious and will undoubtedly voice
fears that the Commission is moving too fast. For these more sceptical
governments, the priority is to implement existing legislation which lays
the foundation for further liberalisation.
As one French official says: 'Liberalise, yes, but only on condition that it
benefits the European operators. If we go too quickly, it isn't European
operators who will draw the advantages but private outsiders such as AT&amp;T
(of the US).'
Mr Karel Van Miert, the Belgian socialist in charge of competition at the
Commission, and Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, are anxious
to avoid being labelled uncompromising liberals, sacrificing standards and
financial stability to the free market. They will urge telecoms ministers to
make the safeguarding of a reliable and affordable universal service a
prerequisite for liberalisation; and they will propose that countries with
less developed networks get an extra two years at least to catch up with
their wealthier partners. That concession will be welcomed by the poorer
member states, which stand to gain from EC funding to upgrade their
telephone networks.
Mr Carpentier regards the Commission's 1998 timetable as ambitious, noting
that five years is 'not long' for state telecoms companies to adjust; but he
sees the Commission's proposals as at least a signal of what could be done
if operators, users and governments co-operate. 'The machine has been
started up and it's started under the best conditions because the
consultations have produced a great political and technical consensus.'
The main worry of the state-owned operators is that even if they are ready
to face fiercer competition from 1998, they will not be adequately
compensated, through charges for access to their public networks, for having
to maintain a service for all comers.
Deutsche Telekom, for example, is committed to completing a DM60bn (Pounds
24.3bn) programme of infrastructure investment in eastern Germany over the
next four years. It believes early competition on international and
long-distance calls could undermine the traditional cross-subsidisation of
local calls.
France Telecom, in spite of its own lead in the liberalisation of
specialised services, argues that the public operators must be given
sufficient time to adapt their tariff structures to the rigours of a free
market, and be able to fix realistic access charges.
British Telecom and Cable and Wireless, the UK's leading operators, are the
most ardent advocates of liberalisation among EC operators. They criticise
the Commission for timidity: in particular, they want to see competition
extended from voice traffic to infrastructure, enhancing the capacity of
companies to compete on service range and quality.
Mr Iain Vallance, BT chairman, says: 'Telecommunications monopolies are a
dangerous anachronism in the fast-moving and increasingly world-scale
markets of the 1990s. Urgent remedial action is required.'
BT's stance is a marriage of consumer and self-interest. A decade after
privatisation, the UK company is no stranger to the market, or to regulators
seeking to mimic market pressures.
Oftel, Britain's telecoms watchdog, is the UK's prototype independent
utility regulator, assertive from the outset; while Cable and Wireless, a
long-time international operator licensed in 1984 to compete against BT at
home, swiftly established Mercury in the UK business market. It now claims a
10 per cent share of the business and residential market, combined with a
network able to reach most of the country. Hard on its heels are cable TV
companies offering local data and telephony services. Barely a year after
the cable companies entered the field, 30 suppliers have nearly 150,000
lines installed between them.
Following liberalisation, BT is confident it could win market share from its
European counterparts. But it is not only targetting their existing
business. It has ambitious plans to use leased lines, new technology and its
own network to make itself a leader in 'global outsourcing' - offering
international companies 'one-stop' contracts for phone, data, maintenance
and other value-added network services. BT has a fledgling network
management company, Syncordia, and is battling with AT&amp;T for direct access
to the US public network.
The UK's experience begs the question: does privatisation - or, at least,
the conversion of telecoms companies to autonomous entities within the state
structure - itself act as a motor for liberalisation?
The question is pertinent, for the demise of Europe's old-style, state-run
posts and telecoms operators (PTOs) is nigh. Just four years ago almost all
Europe's PTOs were run by government departments, their operations and
finances under direct ministerial supervision. Since then, most have been -
or are being - converted into state-owned limited companies. Pressure for
full privatisation is mounting.
Political economists generally regard the two as linked. Once governments
stop treating PTOs as pots of gold and start putting their managers at arm's
length, goes the argument, they more readily perceive the wider benefits of
competition.
The Spanish case - where privately-owned Telefonica has retained a monopoly
over basic voice services - does not easily fit this mould. But other recent
experience tends to do so. Not just in Britain and the US; radical changes
currently under way in Finland also show liberalisation going hand in hand
with a determined loosening of government ties. Since Finland's reforms
could result in Europe's most competitive market in fixed-line 'voice'
services, they will be followed closely in the EC.
Six years ago the Finnish government separated the regulatory and
operational functions of its communications ministry and liberalised the
equipment and value-added sectors of its telecoms industry. In 1990, the
country's PTO was turned into a 'state enterprise', its finances separated
from the state budget. Legislation is now before the Finnish parliament to
convert the PTO into a limited company. Initially it will be wholly
state-owned, but privatisation is likely before long.
From next January, Finland will have a fully functioning duopoly in local
and trunk calls. Its 49 private regional companies, which service local
calls for about two-thirds of Finnish subscribers, have formed a single
company which has been licensed to compete with Telecom Finland (TF) on
trunk routes on its own network. Last week it applied to compete on
international calls too.
For its part, TF has been licensed to compete on local calls throughout the
country. To reduce cross-subsidisation, it is likely for the first time to
start adjusting tariffs between regions to reflect costs, as do the private
operators at the moment.
Is that politically controversial? (The Commission's communication, note,
talks of 'special arrangements and transitional periods for the peripheral
regions and countries with small and less developed networks'). 'The
government has taken the risk, and they will have to provide subsidies if
they are unhappy - we are not going to do so,' says Mr Mikko Pirinen, TF's
consumer services director.
The past three years have also seen TF expand overseas in unprecedented
fashion. It is part of a consortium to establish a new fixed network for
Estonia, and is engaged in numerous joint ventures in other Baltic states
and north-western Russia.
Such cross-border activity will flourish across Europe as privatisation
advances. Since most governments remain opposed to their telecoms companies
falling into foreign hands, it will mainly take the form of partnerships and
joint ventures. The Greek government, for instance, is keen to sell up to 49
per cent of its state telecom company's equity, most of it to an overseas
operator prepared to provide management skills and substantial investment.
There and elsewhere, even in rich states such as Germany, the need for
investment is the motor behind privatisation. It is already happening in the
Asia Pacific region, where Salomon brothers estimate that companies with a
total capitalisation in excess of Dollars 50bn (Pounds 33bn) are likely to
seek equity flotations within the next three years, initially yielding more
than Pounds 10bn (Pounds 6.6bn) in new investment.
Analysts talk of a telecoms industry by 2,000 in which five or so 'super
carriers' provide network management for global business, with fierce
competition, especially in the local loop, between mobile, fixed-wire and
cable carriers.
Sir John Hicks, the Nobel economics laureate, famously remarked that the
greatest monopoly profit is the quiet life. For Europe's telecoms
monopolists, there will be no more peace.

London Weekend Television's Pounds 55m pot of money for 44 top managers was
clearly successful in shackling almost all of them to the company for the
ITV franchise period. But how many of the golden handcuffs will survive the
gold rush when the troops actually get their hands on their share options in
September, and at least 15 become instant millionaires?
Some, at least, are already hinting that they intend to take the money, and
run to find something less tedious to do than slave away for a company with
a penchant for cost-cutting.

Generous or niggardly, the conditions under which Britain's hived-off public
employees are being privatised could be worse. They can at least count on
greater security than the literal under-dogs of the public sector - the
custodial canines of the prison service.
Should the decision be taken to contract out the dog service along with the
rest of the prisons' workers, the future would seem bleak for many of the
four-legged variety.
In a written parliamentary answer Derek Lewis, newly in charge of the
prisons, has promised that dog-handlers who wished to keep their charges
would be allowed to. Otherwise, the animals would be offered to the armed
forces, customs and excise, or the police.
But as for any that still fail to find a home, he added only: 'These are
working dogs trained to bite and the options for suitable placements are
limited.'

Asil Nadir may not have many assets to which he can lay claim at the moment.
But since jumping bail, he has perhaps done something to benefit Polly

It can hardly be pure coincidence that the venue from which he conducted his
press conference for the world's media on Friday was Cyprus's Jasmine Court
hotel, and since his appearance was postponed several times, the assembled
hacks no doubt took solace in increasing the bar takings.
Oddly enough, it appears that the Jasmine Court is owned by a company in
which the administrators of Polly Peck are claiming a controlling interest.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While it is a long time since Beijing's Temple of Heaven was the scene of
Chinese Emperors' harvest prayers, the shrine has suddenly become the centre
of envious speculation. Citizens are agog to learn which of their present
leaders will be the first to bow down there before one of the prime fetishes
of capitalism, to the extent of acquiring it for personal use.
The idol to be displayed at the temple is a Ferrari, in politically suitable
red, being air-freighted from Italy by importers who have already
established a hot-line in a near-by hotel to solicit offers.
The local paper Yangchen Evening News has done its best to help the
enterprise by describing the exhibit as the 'sparkling diamond' among luxury
cars, and pointing out that owners include not only aristocrats and business
tycoons, but pop stars to boot.
Alas they are unlikely to be joined by even a comparably small elite in
China. The average worker would need to save the whole of his or her pay for
500 years to afford such a model at almost Pounds 88,000.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Observer: Sweet song of success
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
However many British companies as well as voters look back in anger on what
may ere long come to be known as 'the Lamont years', there is one enterprise
that can celebrate them with a chorus of Je ne regrette rien not only
heart-felt but melodious.
Moreover the outfit's progress stirs modest pride in the breast of Observer,
who first introduced it to the broader public just three weeks after Norman
Lamont's installation as chancellor of the exchequer in November 1990.
Called The New Company, it is admittedly unusual in that its members aren't
in it for the money, all earning their living in various ways elsewhere.
Their corporate interest lies in being amateur singers of such high ability
as to be sought after to perform with professional orchestras.
The reason for the company's existence is that - perhaps reflecting the
present government's relationship with the electorate - professional
conductors do not always treat their volunteer singers in a way they find
acceptable. Hence half a dozen of them formed a self-managed choir, hoping
to give top amateurs a stronger voice in deciding with whom, and in what,
they performed.
Far from leaving the company chanting Buddy can you spare a dime?, the
revolt has led to increasing demand culminating in in a booking for a
Promenade Concert on September 9, in which the founder directors will be
joined by some 45 other part-timers on their books.
Whether Lamont will by then feel like singing along with them is doubtful.
They're performing Schiller's Ode to Joy in the last movement of Beethoven's
Ninth.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Tecs in a tangle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS should look hard at the FT's survey of Training and Enterprise
Council directors, published today. It shows that these 1,220 individuals
are committed to their task, generally satisfied with the progress of their
organisations, but unhappy about the Tecs' relationship with government and
in a fearful muddle about priorities.
These findings are not difficult to explain. When it started setting up the
Tecs three years ago, the government's official prospectus defined their
task as 'to reskill the workforce and stimulate business growth.'
It said the weighty task of running existing government programmes for the
unemployed and young people would be 'a foundation' from which local leaders
would 'assess economic and social needs, set priorities for action and
direct resources accordingly.' This was the pitch that attracted an
impressive crop of business leaders across the country to serve on Tec
boards, alongside officials from the public sector and trades unionists.
The reality has been that the Tecs have struggled to run these schemes, at a
time of rising unemployment and constrained public spending. They have felt
hemmed in, overburdened and subject to stifling bureaucratic oversight.
This is why over 80 per cent of Tec directors say that their top priority is
either local economic regeneration or in-company training rather than
running the schemes.
Denied freedom
Two striking ironies occur. The first is that of the Tecs' budget this year
of Pounds 2.3bn, Pounds 1.8bn will go on these programmes. The Tecs are thus
being paid huge sums of money to do a task they do not much rate, while
being denied freedom and funds to get on with the things their leaders think
are most important.
The second irony is that much to the Tecs' irritation, the government
continues to encourage a proliferation of other types of agencies to
stimulate economic regeneration. Two have been formed in London in the last
six months, even though the capital has no fewer than nine Tecs.
It is not that the Tecs' grumbles should all be taken at face value. Many of
them have struggled to achieve acceptable levels of performance, although
without published audits on individual Tecs it is difficult to gauge the
scale of this problem. But there is a desperate need for some clear and
co-ordinated thinking by government.
Compound the muddle
These are some of the questions ministers need to address:
1. How can responsibility for business advice, inward investment and local
economic regeneration be rationalised at the local level? Mr Michael
Heseltine's programme of one-stop shops will, on present plans, take years
to implement.
2. How can Whitehall better co-ordinate its own efforts on training?
Divisions between the departments of education, employment and trade and
industry continue to compound the muddle and to make government a weak
advocate for 'partnership' among competing local interests? It is notable
that this problem is much less serious in Scotland, where the Scottish
Office provides the necessary co-ordination.
3. What is to be done about the evident need (also highlighted in the
survey) for greater national co-ordination of the Tecs' views and
objectives? There is still a woeful inability at the national level to
measure Britain's skills gaps and to plan to fill them.
4. Are Tecs, as currently constituted, the right bodies to run training
schemes for the unemployed?
At their best, the Tecs are emerging as dynamic local agencies, fostering
the partnership upon which government rightly sets much store. But there is
now a serious danger that having engaged the interest of business leaders,
government is failing to follow through.
It was an insight of the Thatcher years that government should not try to do
business's job. There is currently a risk that the opposite fallacy will
become entrenched - that business is able to do the government's job. If the
government does not recognise its responsibilities, the still tender plant
of the Tecs will run to seed.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Fields of frustration: China's economic miracle is fuelling
an exodus from its rural heartland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's just not worthwhile ploughing the fields any more,' says Yan, a peasant
farmer from Sichuan province in China's centre-west. 'We've got enough to
eat at home, but no money to spend, so people are leaving their villages to
find work. In our village, there are only kids and old people left.'
Dressed in ragged clothes and obliged to sleep on the ground in Beijing's
overcrowded railway station, Yan and his colleagues are part of a vast,
surging army that involves what may well prove one of the greatest
population shifts in history. The peasant exodus - according to official
statistics at least 15m have deserted the land for the cities since the late
1980s - is sounding alarm bells, perhaps belatedly, in Beijing. For it
reflects not only a desire by impoverished peasants to share the fruits of
China's rapid economic expansion, it also reveals deepening disillusionment
among the country's 900m farmers and their families over the slim benefits
of toiling in the fields.
Official statistics reveal that peasant per capita net income is Yn770
(Dollars 135) a year. This represents less than half that of urban dwellers.
Agricultural production is also flagging compared with industrial output.
Growth in 1992 reached just 3 per cent against 19 per cent for industrial
production.
The bleak outlook for peasant farmers, dependant on tiny plots of land, is
the other side of the coin of China's economic 'miracle', based as it is on
the success of new industrial enterprises in coastal regions fuelled partly
by investment from abroad. This marks a sharp reversal from the beginning of
China's economic reforms in the early 1980s when agriculture led the way and
peasant farmers were held up as models of entrepreneurial achievement.
Officials in Beijing say that after internal Chinese travel restrictions
were relaxed it was inevitable that farmers would drift away from their
villages towards areas where economic rewards might be higher, such as
China's larger cities and coastal regions.
The number of people affected by this economic shift is staggering. Mr Yi
Yan Li, a specialist in migrant labour at the agriculture ministry,
estimates that among China's 400m peasant labourers, about 160m are surplus
to requirements. 'These numbers,' he said 'are equivalent to the population
of a big country.'
About 100m peasants have been absorbed in the past 10 years into township
and village enterprises that have mushroomed all over China, but this still
leaves a vast pool of under-utilised farm labourers which Mr Li described as
a 'severe problem.'
If the authorities cannot persuade people to stay down on the farm, or at
least in nearby towns and villages, then problems of urban overcrowding -
and the associated danger of heightened political unrest - might become
overwhelming. Increasingly dissatisfied with their lot as the gap in incomes
between city and country dwellers becomes ever wider, peasants have begun
assailing local tax-collecting officials, sometimes violently.
Authorities are especially worried about another consequence of the
migration of peasants to urban areas - it has weakened the ability of
officials to enforce family planning controls.
In an effort to bolster birth control efforts, an additional 15,000 family
planning associations have been established, but these organisations have
proved intrusive and unpopular.
Sharpening the focus of peasant discontent over the past year or so has been
the sometimes protracted delays by local authorities in redeeming 'IOUs', or
promissory notes, to farmers obliged to sell a proportion of their grain to
the state. Peasant anger goaded the central government into bringing heavy
pressure to bear on local officials to honour obligations. Nevertheless
Beijing must share responsibility since it has been slow to transfer funds.
At the recent session of the National People's Congress, the Chinese
parliament, leaders were taken to task in private discussions over the
dangers of neglecting the 'farm sector'. Wan Li, one of China's eight
'immortal' leaders - the surviving Long March veterans in the leadership -
is said to have assailed Premier Li Peng over 'lukewarm' references to
agriculture in his 'work report' to the Congress.
Mr Wan reportedly summoned the ghosts of leaders of peasant revolts in
China's history to remind Mr Li of the dangers of neglecting more than 80
per cent of China's 1.1bn people. He is also said to have pointed out to his
listeners the vital importance of peasant support to the success of the
communist revolution.
In his parliamentary address, Mr Li admitted that agriculture, which he
described as the 'foundation of our economy', was 'relatively weak', and
noted that peasant incomes had risen slowly and their financial burden has
been 'too heavy'. This was a reference to taxes which are not meant to
exceed 5 per cent of net income and other local levies. Peasants are said to
be paying on average about 10 per cent of their meagre earnings in taxes and
levies. Costs of farm supplies such as fertilisers have also shot up
recently as China has begun phasing out subsidies.
China's budget this year provides for a 9.3 per cent increase in investment
in agriculture to Yn42bn, but few believe that this will do much to redress
a growing imbalance between the agricultural sector and industry. According
to government figures, agriculture's share of gross national product slid
from 33.7 per cent in 1978, when the so-called open-door reforms began, to
22.1 per cent in 1991.
Recent forecasts of grain output have also painted a fairly gloomy picture
when taken together with alarming reports of the 'loss' of at least 1.6m
hectares of invaluable farmland to industrial parks and development zones.
The official China Daily newspaper commented recently that grain production
is likely to drop in coming years due to 'shrinking arable land and deflated
enthusiasm among farmers'. Output this year is forecast to be 442.5m tonnes,
roughly the same as last year. A target of 475m tonnes in 1997, outlined by
Premier Li in March, is regarded as unrealistic, given problems of morale
among farmers and slender rewards available from grain production on small
plots of land.
The authorities have been slow to recognise the dangers posed by
deteriorating morale in the countryside, coupled with problems caused by the
peasant exodus to the cities. There is little sign officials have worked out
how to deal with the challenge, beyond expressions of concern. As the income
gap between country and city, rich and poor, continues to widen tensions
will certainly not diminish.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Letter: Business history for managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms MARY B ROSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Arnold Kransdorff ('Teaching the history of business', May 1) suggested
that putting business history on the school curriculum would encourage a
'cultural revolution' which would transform British business prospects. He
did not explain how this would be achieved.
The neglect of business history in Britain's management schools is far more
important. Internationally comparative business history demonstrates there
is no magic formula to ensure competitive advantage. Instead, it shows the
need for flexibility in business and the importance of tailoring strategy
and structure to accommodate the ever-changing characteristics of particular
societies and markets.
By allowing a dynamic analysis of strategy, the study of business history
can provide a valuable extra dimension to management training. The teaching
of business history in British management schools would generate a real gain
for management education rather than the decidedly dubious benefit of a
so-called 'business culture' in schools.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Letter: Folly of pouring Pounds 800m into 'black hole' of EC
agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TERRY WYNN MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to your leader 'Fraud in the EC' (May 5), the UK
presidency in reaching agreement at the Edinburgh summit last December on
the future financing of the EC, clearly did not help tax-payers by agreeing
that agricultural spending could be bailed out by an extra Pounds 800m. The
chickens are now coming home to roost.
This week the Commission presented its preliminary draft budget for the EC
for 1994. A monetary reserve of Ecu1bn exists in the EC's budget but it has
only ever been used twice in the past. On those occasions the absolute
ceiling fixed for agricultural spending (the guideline) was not exceeded and
the overspend related solely to dollar/Ecu fluctuations.
Now the financial regulation is to be altered to allow for European Monetary
System fluctuations - this has never been the case in the past. It is
already predicted that this will exceed the agricultural guideline by
Ecu1.3bn in 1994. With creative accounting and good luck the Commission will
be expected to get this down to an Ecu1bn overspend by use of the reserve.
It does seem worth asking whether the UK is satisfied that a further Pounds
800m should be poured into this black hole of agricultural spending when
fraud in the existing system is so widespread and when other issues such as
job creation are paramount.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Letter: Fossil fuel levy should not be replaced by VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr B C BATEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Newbery makes two rash assertions in an otherwise excellent
commentary on the workings of the electricity supply industry and the Fossil
Fuel Levy ('Fossil fuel levy fails efficiency test', May 6.)
The first is to say that 'the obvious solution is to replace the FFL with
VAT.' Why? The construction of nuclear power stations was a strategic
decision concerning the diversity of supply and it was reaffirmed by
successive governments. It was therefore not a mistake. If this decision now
requires revenue to support it then surely this should be raised through the
general burden of taxation rather than falling on the hapless purchaser of
electricity.
This leads to his second assertion: that lower product prices would result
from a switch to VAT on electricity. This is unlikely to happen in the
present circumstances with margins tight or non-existent, and UK
manufacturers paying more for their electricity than those of any other EC
country except Germany and Italy. The more likely prospect is that
manufacturers would give a huge sigh of relief as an uncompetitive cost
component was removed. In short the saving would not be passed on.
The FFL is a device to raise (not recover) revenue. It is manifestly wrong
and as, David Newbery remarks, a distortion; industry would be well rid of
it. Unfortunately, to remove its effect to taxation would tend to attack one
of the government's sacred cows of not appearing to raise taxes and is
therefore not politically correct.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Letter: The pricing of CDs in the US and the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN DEACON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am sorry to see that in the case of the music business you do not
exercise the same rigour as you do in your analyses of other sectors.
CD prices are not 40 per cent higher in Europe than in the US. Even if there
was any relevance in making comparisons based on exchange rates, the figure
would be around 10-15 per cent. Contrary to your assertion, there are very
good reasons for this. Cultural products are not like soap powder and
selling music into 15 different countries with 15 different languages
requires a fresh approach to packaging and marketing, and higher costs in
each territory. In the US, any record, American or not, is marketed over an
area five times the size of the UK with one coherent campaign. The potential
for costs savings is clear.
The British record industry has always budgeted on the basis of UK sales
alone and then entered into licensing agreements with foreign record
companies for export. Even if we wanted to export directly to the US we
could not - their very high import taxes mean it is not feasible, a
situation your advocacy of the abolition of import controls in the other
direction, into Britain, fails to take into account.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms LISA GORDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader on compact disc prices proposes amendments to the Copyright
Act to allow parallel importation as a means of controlling the price of CDs
in the UK. This proposal fails on at least two grounds of practicality and
displays inadequate comprehension of copyright law.
Parallel importation traditionally refers to articles lawfully made in the
country of origin. However, what, say of Belgium or Poland, where copies of
foreign sound recordings can be lawfully made without the permission of the
original producers: are these to be excluded from the UK? If so, how can the
copyright law distinguish between different categories of lawfully made
product?
Further, if, as your article suggests, the removal of copyright import
controls has a direct effect on pricing, why is it that domestic CD prices
in Japan, where no copyright import controls are possible, are among the
highest, while in the US, where prices are constantly cited as among the
lowest, the copyright law provides full control over parallel importation?
The
link between parallel importation and pricing is far more complex than this
superficial proposal suggests, as I believe Australian consumers will soon
discover.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your editorial on compact disc pricing, you recommend that the
competition authorities follow the lead set by Australia, which has
concluded that a ban on parallel imports is against the public interest. As
the managing director of an independent record company I know that consumers
will stand to gain little from such a measure when it comes into force next
year and that the Australian record industry, particularly the smaller
independent companies, stand to lose much.
The prohibition of parallel imports keeps the record industries of the world
in balance and is practised by all the major music producing countries,
including the USA, Canada, Germany, Italy and Spain. Its purpose is to stop
domestic markets being flooded by cheap imports that attack the ability of
the indigenous record industries to produce a wide variety of product for
the home market. The USA, just as much as smaller territories, have very
severe and rigorously enforced regulations covering foreign imports. Only
last year copies of U2's Achtung Baby were turned away at the American
border because they were not of American manufacture.
While the US authorities have no intention of abolishing their own
restrictions - and they don't - it would be disastrous to dispense with our
own.
At present, record companies grant licenses covering the use of their rights
to foreign companies on a territory-by-territory basis and artists are
sometimes signed to different labels in different territories. The absence
of import controls in the UK alone handicaps British record companies in
their own domestic market, while their competitors continue to enjoy full
protection.
The first to suffer will be the independents, both record companies and
retailers. Cheap overseas recordings will push the companies out of
business, while retailers without American operations through which they can
purchase and re-route stock - all but HMV and WH Smith - will be severely
disadvantaged.
Import controls are fundamental to the exploitation of intellectual property
rights in music. Their abolition here would deprive the UK of the creative
and independent seed-bed from which the British record industry has, up till
now, flourished.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial 'Bulky prices for compact discs' (May 4) contains a
number of factual inaccuracies concerning the pricing of CDs in the US and
UK. In this, sadly, it is characteristic of the entire debate around the
value of music that has been conducted in the wake of the select committee
on national heritage.
You assert that prices in Europe are about 40 per cent higher than in North
America. Top line CDs commonly retail in the US at Dollars 14.99, and in the
UK at Pounds 11.99. Commentators typically fail to allow for the presence of
VAT in the UK figure and the exclusion of sales tax in the US, 12 per cent
currently in New York state. Even at these prices (many CDs in Britain are
priced at Pounds 9.99) the price differential between the US and UK works
out at approximately 11 per cent, not 40 per cent.
You write that the industry's argument that the cost of supplying CDs in the
UK is higher than in the US 'does not ring true'. However, the economies of
scale in North America mean that virtually all consumer goods are cheaper in
the US because their distribution costs and their development costs can be
spread over a market five times the size of the UK. Clothes, food, cars,
petrol, cosmetics and books all fall into this category. It costs EMI
two-thirds less to manufacture CDs in the US than in the UK precisely
because of these volume efficiencies.
Moreover, the largest retailing chains in the US maintain a smaller market
share than do the largest retailers in Europe.
In the UK, the WH Smith Group, Woolworth and HMV combined have a market
share of well over 50 per cent. By comparison, the top 10 music retailers in
the US have only a 32 per cent market share. As a result, US music
retailers' gross margins average around 24 per cent as against a UK figure
of 33 per cent.
You criticise copyright law for maintaining 'wide differentials in wholesale
prices between the US and the UK which are then reflected in retail prices'.
The wholesale price differentials are small, and are augmented (rather than
reflected) at retail because of larger retail margins in the UK. The right
granted to copyright owners to restrict parallel imports is only one of the
vital rights granted by UK legislation. It is not a right granted to record
companies alone, but also protects artists, composers and music publishers
within the music industry, and extends to protect rights owners in other
businesses such as book publishing, computer software and pharmaceuticals.
All of these businesses invest in the UK and need to secure a return on that
investment from UK sales. The desirability of this right in encouraging
creativity and risk-taking is recognised not only in the UK but also in many
other countries including the USA, Canada and Germany.
The Australian authorities, which last year recommended the withdrawal of
the parallel importation right in 1994, are now reconsidering their position
because recent exchange rate charges have eroded the price differential
between Australian records and those in certain foreign markets. Exchange
rate fluctuations, resulting from government actions and the machinations of
the money markets, are perhaps the key determinants of relative prices.
Profit is not a dirty word; the Pounds 2 off the price of CDs advocated by
WH Smith would certainly make it a rare one. The last comprehensive survey
of the UK record industry was carried out by Coopers &amp; Lybrand and covered
1990. It showed that the average return on sales of British record
companies, big and small, was approximately 5 per cent. Acting upon WH
Smith's recommendations would plunge most of these record businesses into
loss at a stroke, at no cost to WH Smith and its fellow retailers who would
retain their margins and expect higher volume.
Consumers will not, even in the medium term, benefit from such action.
Through the continual pursuing of a policy of price reductions, the American
record industry typically operates on wafer-thin margins. The consumer in
America has predictably suffered as cost pressures have forced the American
industry to reduce their investment in artists and in genres of music.
Attempting to understand the complexities of the British record industry and
its value to our cultural life and economy has not been placed at a premium
throughout this current debate on CD pricing. Let us hope that the select
committee and the Office of Fair Trading will study the facts before the
rhetoric.
I am mindful of the prime minister's recent exhortations to business people,
when he urged them 'to keep on exporting and we'll keep on supporting'. The
British music industry is the third largest earner of invisible exports for
this country, and with the support of the government, EMI and other record
companies intend to improve upon their already impressive drive for exports.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Letter: Guild mentality of doctors and cabbies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BERNARD HEYMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would like to congratulate Dominic Lawson on his piece highlighting
the 'guild mentality' of the medical profession ('Doctors: a
life-threatening problem', May 1.)
I cannot help feeling, however, that he is fighting a lost cause. Everyone
needs to consult a doctor at some point and this inhibits politicians from
taking a radical decision. The doctors defeated the government in 1948 and
have continued to do so, in one way or another, since then.
More immediately it will be interesting to see whether the government will
be able to modify the regulations requiring mini-cabs to be registered. Like
the doctors, the black cab mafia are using their monopoly position to
prevent anything that vaguely threatens them. After all, virtually every
member of parliament uses taxis]

FT  10 MAY 93 / Arts: Distances and Antiphonies - Birtwistle premieres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Key aspects of Harrison Birtwistle's music were freshly illuminated at the
weekend. Two new works - the first brand-new, the second a deuxieme given
only a few days after the world premiere, in Paris - were played in two
successive concerts, by the Ensemble InterContemporain at the Purcell Room
on Friday, and by the Philharmonia under Pierre Boulez at the Festival Hall
on Saturday. (The Philharmonia, whose recently-forged Paris connections seem
to be resulting in lively new things happening on both sides of the Channel,
was patron of both events.)
The opportunity to encounter Five Distances for Five Wind Instruments
(Friday) and Antiphonies for piano and orchestra (Saturday) side by side was
a particular boon, since the direct result was to forbid easy critical
generalisation - always a good thing. Taken on its own, the former work
might suggest that Birtwistle's muse has without losing its muscularity
become unprecedentedly relaxed, even genial, and able to pack complex ideas
into an ever-smaller handful of well-placed notes. Taken likewise, the
latter would surely prove the converse, that his music has never seemed more
massively structured, aggressive in cut and thrust, and difficult to follow
from moment to moment.
Together, the two works indicate, rather, that Britain's leading composer of
middle years has not lost his immense capacity for adventure and surprise.
Also, they demonstrate Birtwistle's abiding fascination with musical
visions, multifarious in substance however diverse in scale, to which the
listening 'eye' must repeatedly be returned during the course of unfolding
for glimpses of the same subject matter from new vantage points; and,
consequently, his unparalleled ability to invent music that sounds at once
fiercely new, richly many-layered, and as though it had always been there.
In the wind quintet, it is the differentness of the five instruments, their
refusal to blend in the manner of strings, that creates the unfolding drama.
Any alliances solidified en route are soon subject to disruption; two or
three voices temporarily joining melodically above the critical punctuation
(Stravinskianly cross-cut) of the others are destined to stray apart, even
come to blows, in ways that define powerful new identities for each
component instrument and a powerful new mode of chamber-musical argument.
Eventually, the music seems to peter out into pacific accord, except that
subversive stutters from the bassoon keep hinting otherwise: a wonderfully
robust touch, characteristic of a composer whose attainment of artistic
order always involves fierce physical confrontation.
The new concertante composition - emphatically not a concerto - is much
harder to grapple with and assess. As in previous Birtwistle works, setting
up a strong solo element within a large-orchestra context, all notions of
'solo' and 'orchestra' are inevitably put to the most stringent tests, with
violent batteries of percussion and frenzied internal contests of internal
groupings as part of the process.
On this occasion, though, I continually lost touch with that distinctness of
identification, timbral, harmonic, and in terms of tempo, which normally
guarantees the mounting exhilaration of a new Birtwistle experience.
Antiphonies - written in memory of Howard Hartog, revered publisher and
later artists' agent, and played with formidable brilliance by Joanna
McGregor and the Philharmonia - seems the toughest nut the composer has
offered for cracking in many years. More than one go is plainly needed to
get at its nourishing centre.
Philharmonia concert, sponsored by AFG, to be broadcast tonight on Radio 3.

There is a decidely medicinal smell to tonight's TV schedule. Horizon (BBC 2
at 8pm) looks at the growing global asthma epidemic; Panorama (BBC 1 at
9.30) examines how the tobacco industry has suppressed research linking
smoking to disease; The Doctor (BBC 1 at 7.30) is a repeat of the
documentary series which follows a practice of GPs on its daily round in the
Yorkshire Dales.
On the fictional front there is a chance to discover whether there is life
after Morse. Not apparently for John Thaw, who came a cropper trying to be
charming to the French in the ill-fated A Year in Provence. Now his old
side-kick Kevin Whately gets his chance as an ambitious rural doctor in Peak
Practice. Whether he can lift what looks like another series of emotional
dramas set in a pretty landscape into anything memorable only time and the
ratings can tell. (ITV at 8.30).
Finally Channel 4 at 8.30 has a re-run of the medical comedy Surgical
Spirit. Hypochondriacs might be best directed towards the repeat run for The
Men's Room (BBC 1 at 10.15) which shows off healthy bodies.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Arts: The Chinese Wolf - London pub theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the temporary closure of the Gate in Notting Hill for refurbishment
and modest expansion, the Bush has become standard bearer of pub theatre in
West London. It will be fascinating to see whether it follows the Gate's
example and seeks permission (and funds) from its landlords for some
improvement in the premises.
For pub theatre has become something of a paradox. Here are places where we
see some of the best directing and acting in London, yet where the
conditions are distinctly uncomfortable and there is room for an audience of
scarcely 100, sometimes much less. The Gate and the Bush are by no means the
only examples. There are others, some of which reach very high standards,
like the Hen and Chickens in Islington and the Etcetera in Camden Town.
Even leaving the physical discomforts aside, a modest expansion of seating
capacity could change the economics. The Gate, in particular, has had
frequently to turn people away. A rise in box office takings could increase
the theatre's freedom to do what it likes and reduce the time spent on
fund-raising.
What we don't know, however, is whether expansion and a general improvement
of the facilities would spoil the atmosphere which the Gate and the Bush
have built up. Maybe the idea of working on a shoestring is crucial to the
effect. Certainly watching good work in a cramped space makes you feel
literally hooked: there is no escape, even if you wished to leave. At its
best, this confinement is one the most exhilarating experiences in
contemporary theatre.
Such thoughts occurred, not for the first time, at the Bush on Saturday. The
performances and the direction are immaculate, but the play is good only in
parts. How much of the magic is achieved by the special nature of the place?
Here, after all, is Desmond Barrit fresh from his triumphs in The Royal
Shakespeare Company's Comedy of Errors. Practically the entire cast has had
experience of either the RSC or the National Theatre; they have all made
frequent appearances on television. The director, Dominic Dromgoole, has
been leading the Bush for the last three years, and has a string of
successes behind him - probably ahead as well.
And yet there may be an imbalance. The play is The Chinese Wolf by David
Ashton, a writer who has had a previous work, A Bright Light Shining, at the
Bush and has also written extensively for the small screen. This latest
piece was commissioned by the Bush Theatre.
In many ways it is immensely enjoyable. It would be hard not to admire
Barrit's performance as a huge, bullying property developer. There is
imagination, too, in the creation of Max, the hunch-back son of an Italian
mother by a one night stand with a car salesman. Max, wonderfully played by
Ronan Vibert, is left to mind the south London junk yard while his mother is
off on a bank holiday jaunt to Brighton and the property developer moves in.
There is a lesbian mechanic from Scotland and a bisexual girl called Claire
who sometimes dresses as a nun. Again the performances, by Maureen Beattie
and Julia Ford respectively, are impeccable, but merely to describe the
action suggests that we not watching the best of plays.
Much of The Chinese Wolf is derivative and nostalgic: repeated playing of
The Platters, including a witty juxtaposition of their two best known songs,
Only You and The Great Pretender. Ashton draws heavily on Hollywood
westerns, notably High Noon, and on horror movies - hence the title and the
idea that there is a chinese wolf outside the junk yard. He sees additional
horrors in Disneyland. It is all great fun while it lasts, though a section
on Claire's first orgasm should be cut. But the question remains: is it the
place, the directing and the acting that make the play? It is definitely not
the other way round. When the Gate reopens in the autumn, we shall learn
more about whether pub theatre can keep its spell in less primitive
conditions.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Arts: Seven figure Digital - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE KAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pleasure of a recession must be that, like banging your head against a
brick wall, it feels so good when it stops. Announcements of seven-figure
sponsorships have been thin on the ground in recent years, but last week the
arts world was reminded of the glory days when the Secretary of State for
National Heritage announced, at the new British Library at St Pancras -
surely the largest and grandest brick wall in London - a Pounds 1 million
sponsorship from Digital.
In return for having an interactive exhibition gallery named after them,
Digital has provided the Library with its largest ever private sponsorship
in the form of computer systems integral to the Online Public Access
Catalogue and the Automated Book Retrieval System, which will ensure that
items from the 12 million volume London holdings can be identified,
retrieved and delivered in 30 minutes.
Digital is also computerising the Tate Gallery's library and archive - a
significant collection of more than 250,000 documents and artefacts relating
to 20th century art. This will be the first art library to go on to such an
image retrieval system in Britain, and Digital will benefit by demonstrating
it to clients and employees as well as receiving traditional corporate
benefits.
These sponsorships build on Digital's existing provision of computer systems
 -which already run the box offices at the Royal National Theatre, Sadler's
Wells and elsewhere - and its continuing support of dance. Where would the
arts be without Digital?
                          *       *      *
If Digital were in Scotland, it would be able to win an Award specifically
for 'sponsorship in kind' - one of the categories in the ABSA Scottish
Awards, held last week in Glasgow and sponsored by United Distillers and The
Scotsman.
It is understandable that, in a recession, sponsorship in kind has grown. It
is less ostentatious in hard times, and the exchange of goods or services it
involves can be more personal than a traditional cheque-signing sponsorship.
This year's category winner was Safeway, which made possible Scottish
Ballet's first ever tour to Russia and the Ukraine by providing three
pantechnicons, with drivers, to transport sets, scenery and costumes,
together with enough Safeway products to feed an entire ballet company, many
of whom were vegetarian.
Six other sponsors - BP Oil, Mobil North Sea, General Accident, the Royal
Bank of Scotland, Scottish Television and One-Up - also received Awards for
their support of the arts in Scotland in 1992.
Current sponsorship in Scotland is healthy and diverse. This year's
Edinburgh International Festival has achieved a record sponsorship and
donation level of Pounds 805,000, compared with Pounds 789,000 last year,
with Scottish Power as the major sponsor.
In the Highlands and Islands, Hydro-Electric has joined forces with the
Edinburgh's Traverse Theatre to take a new play to those remote communities
and to use the play as a springboard for seeking out new playwrights who are
working in isolation, providing them with workshops and rehearsed readings.
This is Hydro-Electric's adventurous first move into theatre: the
sponsorship aims to show a commitment to customers and communities and the
hunt is on within Hydro-Electric for staff with hidden play-writing talents.
In another in-kind sponsorship, the Portfolio Gallery has brought together
artist Calum Colvin with three businesses - Tayburn, B&amp;S Visual Technologies
and Fuji Film - to create a Bosch-inspired exhibition, using
state-of-the-art graphics and photographic technology, of 'The Seven Deadly
Sins and the Four Last Things'. Steven Shear of B&amp;S commented that producing
an artist's images had brought a new dimension to the usage of their
software, more usually employed in advertising, and provided a showcase
demonstrating that the scope of their technology was limited only by the
imagination of the user.
Scotland is also represented in the libidinous ice-cream brand Haagen Dazs'
new arts sponsorship programme, 'Dedicated to Pleasure, Dedicated to the
Arts'. The programme includes the reopening of Edinburgh's Fruitmarket
Gallery and the Edinburgh Book and Film Festivals, and also features video
at the Tate Liverpool, contemporary sculpture in an 18th century National
Trust garden, and an exhibition at Manchester's Cornerhouse.
                          *       *      *
Green sponsorship shoots are also being gobbled up by arts organisations
south of the border. Tyne Tees Television has just contributed a substantial
Pounds 100,000 over four years to the Newcastle-based Northern Sinfonia,
strengthening its existing relationship to the orchestra by becoming a
Platinum Corporate Member of the Northern Sinfonia's new Development Plan.
This goes some way to reassure those concerned about the genuine regional
commitment of the new TV companies: there is an exact overlap between the
home patch of Tyne Tees and the Northern Sinfonia, and it is in both of
their interests to present a vibrant cultural and economic image of the
North East.
Northern Sinfonia will be reinforcing role as the North East's cultural
ambassador, expanding the orchestra's activities in the community and
creating an instrument bank of quality instruments for its young players.
With a similar eye to public perceptions of the private sector, BUPA is to
sponsor live music recitals in NHS hospitals, nursing homes and hospices
through the Council for Music in Hospitals, as well as running a series of
concerts with high profile musicians in stately homes in order to raise the
profile and funds of the Council.
                          *       *      *
Back in London, the British Land Company PLC has put Pounds 180,000 towards
the Tate's major Ben Nicholson retrospective - the first major Nicholson
exhibition since 1969, which will tour to St Etienne and Frankfurt after
London. In addition to client entertainment, the sponsor will give
shareholders a free ticket to the exhibition and will use images from it in
its annual report - designed by another Tate sponsor CDT.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Arts: Heart and soul of the National - Colin Amery admires
the gallery's refurbishment of its Central Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National triumphs are thin on the ground at the moment, but one that offers
more than due cause for celebration was unveiled last week. At the National
Gallery the opening of the refurbished Central Hall (the gift of Lord
Rothschild) marks the completion of a major stage in the reordering and
redecoration of the main galleries. Visitors to the National Gallery are now
able for the first time to stand in the new hall and comprehend at a glance
the whole plan of the building.
If you want to undergo an amazing architectural experience, stand in the
gleaming new hall and look to the east and then to the west. It is now
possible to enjoy a vista of what must be one of the finest enfilades of
great rooms in Europe.
This architectural triumph has two roots. First of all the architect of the
Sainsbury Wing, Robert Venturi, immediately grasped the possibilities of
axial views throughout the whole building when he made the decision to plan
the new extension as a wing of an existing palace. He aligned the approach
to the Sainsbury Wing from the main gallery floor so that the existing axial
plan coincided with the main route to the new wing. His circular bridge with
its screen walls can now be seen as a focussing element that leads the eye
without distraction into the vistas of both the old and the new buildings.
The second root of this triumph was the decision to commit the building
policy of the gallery to a refurbishment programme based upon the
recognition of the architectural virtues of the mainly 19th-century
galleries.
Last week, at the dinner held in the Central Hall to mark its reopening,
Lord Rothschild spoke of the beginning of the battle for the architectural
soul of the National Gallery, which began more than a decade ago. 'The
question was whether or not to re-create the marriage of Victorian art and
architecture which, in the post war period, had been thought somehow
improper and shameful and distracting from the pictures.'
It was in the set of galleries known as the Barry Rooms (designed by EM
Barry 1867-76) that the policy of authentic restoration was first carried
out to remove the whitewash that had been applied after the war to hide the
Victorian polychromy. This successful precedent encouraged the National
Gallery to proceed along the path that has gradually revealed the best
qualities of the existing building.
Thus the Central Hall was restored to the original decorative scheme
designed by Sir John Taylor with John Crace. Lord Rothschild's generous gift
has created a calm centre at the heart of the galleries where, visitors can
meet and rest and feel immediately that they are at the central point of a
new logical hang which divides the collection into four easily identifiable
wings: the Sainsbury Wing, with paintings from 1260 to 1510; the West Wing,
paintings from 1510 to 1600; the North Wing, paintings from 1600 to 1700;
and the East Wing with paintings from 1700 to 1920.
The Crace/Rothschild scheme has been carried out by the gallery architect,
Michael Morrison of Purcell Miller Tritton with Milinaric, Henry and
Zervudachi as the interior decorators. The brilliant team of Hare and
Humphries carried out much of the specialist gilding and painting. The
well-scaled pattern of acanthus leaves on the wool damask walls make a
reticent background to the four battle scenes by Horace Vernet painted for
the Duc d'Orleans, later King Louis Philippe. The intention was not to
create another gallery here, but to keep the hall as a breathing space and a
point of reference for the whole building.
The particular success of the colour scheme in the hall is that it links
through to the redecorated vestibule and makes visual sense of an area that
was once so confused. But there is another modest triumph which visitors
should not miss. A handsome new staircase has been created to take visitors
to the lower floor from room 13 with stone steps and railings, based on a
William Wilkins design. It was an inspired idea to hang the Domenichino
(1581 - 1641) frescoes from the Stanza di Apollo in the Villa Aldobrandini
at Frascati on this staircase. They tell stories of Apollo, the patron of
poetry, music and the arts, and have a light and festive quality.
But the heart is lifted by the whole success of the rejuvenation of the
National Gallery. More remains to be done - the vestibule and the lower
restaurant floor and of course the costly but vital need to redesign the
interiors of the grim Northern extension. Surely donors will flock to ensure
the completion of the settings for this, one of the finest national
collections in the world.
The success of the National Gallery demonstrates that it is possible to
offer the public the highest possible standards of both collection and
display. Underlying it all is a clear understanding of the enlightening
potential of the visual arts. The gallery has been fortunate in its patrons
and its helpers. It stands as it should, as a national exemplar of
breathtaking quality, a model for the world.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Management: Ford's engineers become lateral thinkers / A
look at the company's new programme to spark creativity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN MCNAMARA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford Europe is undertaking what could be the biggest profit-motivated
retraining and re-motivating exercise in the field of production and
engineering. The object, according to Tom Smith, co-ordinator of
occupational psychology at Ford Training and Education, is to make better
motor cars available more quickly.
'As a company we could see areas where the decision-making process stifled
creativity. The aim of the Education Training Quality Improvement Plan
(Equip) is to remove obstacles at all levels, and hopefully everything we
achieve will show through quickly on the cars themselves.'
A few years ago that type of statement would have verged upon heresy in
Henry Ford's empire. But as western manufacturers have watched the Japanese
and latterly the Koreans, slash new model development times from five years
to two, corporate structures have come in for overdue questioning.
Part of the aim is to raise the level of ingenuity and efficiency of the
engineering staff and to change the perception of the engineer within the
organisation.
'Our engineers are first class but if a creative man feels that he is being
badly managed or badly rewarded, he can soon feel penalised because of his
skills. So the wider programme extends to all areas of management,' says
Smith.
Originally conceived by Ford UK, the programme has now been adopted by Ford
Europe which plans to extend it to some 4,000 engineers. Allowing for the
projected individual timespan of the programme - some 15 months - its scale
is enormous.
But just how do you identify the creative engineer? The question is far more
complex than it appears; for instance, normal personnel tests tend to be
self-defeating. Faced with a questionnaire asking whether you have: very few
creative ideas; more than a few; many ideas; would anyone other than a fool
opt for the first?
According to Smith's colleague Fiona Patterson, the answer lies in
questioning established engineering values. 'There is a tendency to
over-engineer solutions to what can be simple problems. This, as with the
set hierarchical structure, is not unique to Ford and probably begins at
university. The creative engineer will have some ability to think
laterally.'
One test devised by the team for use at recruitment level is to take a
ball-bearing travelling down a ramp into and through a funnel (normal time
about five seconds) and ask candidates to extend its journey to 20 seconds.
The majority of engineering graduates seek to slow the ball on the ramp with
cardboard or masking tape. Few bother to ask if they can move the funnel and
even fewer grasp the principle that tilting the funnel will cause the
ball-bearing to spin inside the lip and gain the extra time. A small test,
but a good pointer towards the kind of lateral thinking sought by Ford.
As well as identifying and motivating the creative element, Equip is seeking
to break down other long-term barriers towards engineering excellence.
In common with most retraining programmes the course offers sections on
problem-solving and constructional use of theoretical skills. But where it
differs from other such programmes is in seeking to develop a range of
behavioural skills.
As sequential development and manufacturing is replaced by faster
simultaneous methods, so teamwork is of increasing importance. This is where
the sports psychologists come in. The same disciplines which allow teamwork
on the football pitch can be harnessed in the design and development
processes.
The prize, if Ford succeeds, is engineers freed from their present
constraints and able to match the Japanese in the all-important 'surprise
and delight' field.
At its most simplistic level, this philosophy states that if the product
performs satisfactorily on all other levels - for instance, in a car that
would mean utility, economy, reliability and value-for-money  - the deciding
factors in whether a customer buys one product over another is how many
'surprise and delight' features are available.
To succeed, the company must understand what the public will want, before
they really demand it and it is up to the engineers to provide it. It is a
field in which the Japanese excel. With that in mind, as the first 300 Ford
engineers went into the Equip programme in March, the question of whether
psychologists can speed up the production process took on a great deal of
importance.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Management: Men with a mission - More companies are putting
corporate values into words
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On every desk at Dun &amp; Bradstreet is inscribed a corporate prayer. 'As the
men and women who are The Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corporation, we are a team - One
Company united through shared values' it begins, inciting the 56,000
employees to 'strive relentlessly' and to 'work to be the best'.
In the 2,000 heel bars of the Minit Corporation around the world is a framed
statement declaring that the company's mind is 'positive, optimistic and
determined'. In the pockets of every Motorola worker is a laminated card
bearing that company's mantra.
Corporate values have come out of the closet. In the last few years most big
US organisations have felt the need to make a public statement about what
they believe in, what they are about and where they are going.
The trend has now crossed the Atlantic. According to a report by Digital
Corporation, some 80 per cent of British companies have put their values
into words.
There is no standard form to these pronouncements. Some are just a line or
two, others run to a small volume. Some take the shape of 'mission' or
'vision' statements, setting strategic goals for the business as a whole,
while others lay down standards of behaviour of the people inside the
organisation. But all are trying to capture the essence of the company: to
find something that will tie a diverse group of people and interests to a
single goal or set of values.
It is no surprise that these statements have recently caught on. As the old
hierarchies within companies have toppled, employees have had to take more
decisions for themselves. 'If you flatten an organisation, people have
nothing else to turn to when they make judgments,' says John Humble, the
management consultant who prepared the report for Digital. At the same time
shareholders have increasingly demanded clear statements from companies
justifying their existence.
The most common form of mission statement involves a description - usually
spelt out in the annual report - of the company's aims. This can range from
the banal to the baroque, and may include a statement of its values.
At one extreme is 'Ikea's Business Idea', which simply states as its guiding
principle: 'We shall offer a wide range of home furnishing, items of good
design and function, at prices so low, that the majority of people can
afford to buy them.' At the other extreme is the Body Shop which proclaims
in giant type on the back of its annual report: 'Make compassion, care,
harmony and trust the foundation stones of business. Fall in love with new
ideas.'
Other companies state goals that reach beyond their actual business: J
Sainsbury rather grandly talks not just of selling groceries but of
'contributing to the public good and to the quality of life in the
community'.
When it comes to listing their values, the same ones appear again and again:
most companies cite the need to care for people, customers, quality,
competitiveness, innovation, the community and the environment. Yet not all
statements are so fashion conscious, nor so bland. The Yorkshire
conglomerate BBA unashamedly announces: 'The Victorian work ethic is not an
antique,' and 'grit and gumption are preferable to inertia and intellect.'
But how worthwhile are these statements? Some seem so obvious as to be
barely worth saying, while others are hard to say while keeping a straight
face. Academic evidence from the US suggests that companies with a strong
mission tend to have outperformed their competitors, but then those
companies seem to be better managed generally. The mere existence of a
statement of corporate values or of a mission appears to have little, if
any, effect on a company's performance. The Digital survey shows that more
than 60 per cent of value statements are not strictly adhered to by
managers, let alone by the rest of the workforce.
This is an alarming finding, as a statement which is not being followed
properly can be a liability. 'If you bang on about a mission that is not
believed, you are devaluing management,' says Mike Jeans of consultants
KPMG.
So how can companies make their statements work better? Philip Mellor from
Dun &amp; Bradstreet says the company's value statement is part of a broad
programme of cultural change. To make the values stick, everyone is trained
for five days every year and employees are rewarded on how well they live up
to the values.
The Minit Corporation claims that its statement has been a success partly
because it consulted 300 managers in 27 countries before the final draft was
drawn up.
However, not everyone agrees that companies should have value statements at
all. According to Andrew Campbell of Ashridge Strategic Management Centre,
statements are really only helpful in companies that already live by them.
They are an aide memoire, but not of much use in motivating people or in
helping them change their behaviour.
A case in point is Marks and Spencer, which has grown a strong sense of
corporate value without any formal statement. 'We do not hand out principles
like the 10 Commandments and say thou shalt abide by them,' says a company
spokesman.
Campbell argues that companies should initially limit themselves to the
flattest statements of what they do, and perhaps what it wants to be. 'But
the 'I believe' stuff is very dangerous. If you write it, you'd better
believe it,' he warns.
No doubt BBA really does believe its philosophy of hard grind; whether all
those companies that declare a belief in their people or in the environment
live up to their words is another matter.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Management: Wooing the customer - The Citizen's Charter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH ALDERSEY-WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Public services and companies that responded to the launch of the British
government's Citizen's Charter initiative last year have reported mixed
results from their efforts.
This partly reflects the fact that elements of the Citizen's Charter are
still coming into effect. Earlier this year for example, British Rail's
Network SouthEast gave its first discounts to last year's delayed season
ticket-holders. In addition, from the beginning of the year contractors have
been obliged to explain why a road is being dug up and how long the work
will take. From April, hospitals began to offer appointment and waiting-list
guarantees.
Private-service providers have jumped aboard the bandwagon, but they have
been as prone to miscalculate the tone and content of their charters as the
public sector.
Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, set the ball rolling by asking
the big four clearing banks to introduce charters for their business
customers. Their response came in the form of modest promises. However, the
banks' image was so tarnished by the time their charters came out that they
were dismissed by many customers. They promised too much and were not
believed.
Just as bad is to promise too little. This is where many public-sector
organisations fall short. They hedge their promises. British Rail asks for
its customers' views, but only on comparatively trivial matters such as
station cleanliness and staff behaviour. Its lntercity standards employ such
sophistry that the public has no benchmark by which they can measure
performance.
Perceptive companies, however, see there is a competitive advantage to be
gained from customer charters. 'The big banks had charters forced upon them
and this has coloured people's views,' says Ian Farnfield, a partner at
Dragon International, a marketing consultancy that has advised companies on
preparing charters. 'But they should be viewed as a positive opportunity.'
With any charter it is crucial to avoid promising what people do not really
want. Payment of an average of Pounds 1.50 - the cost of one journey - from
London Underground is poor compensation for a business meeting missed. So is
Pounds 10 from British Gas for a broken appointment.
BAA (formerly British Airports Authority) tried giving monetary vouchers to
compensate for long queues, but soon stopped when research showed the policy
to be counter-productive. 'People didn't really want to know if we had queue
time limits because they thought we might not be checking security
efficiently,' explains Jenny Bradley, director of public affairs at Heathrow
Airport.
On the other hand, a commitment to provide for free something that
occasionally comes at a price can make a good impression - such as Shell's
pledge promising free air and water at its petrol stations.
Farnfield advises businesses not to issue charters if they do not have the
support of both top management and the 'shop-floor' staff who are in contact
with the public.
Many companies have always had internal codes of practice, but saw no
mileage in making them public. But more industries may soon hop aboard the
customer charter bandwagon.
Dragon International believes businesses with the potential to benefit
include those where the customer is obliged to trust a more expert supplier,
such as pharmaceuticals, the building industry and personal financial
services.

tons of coated stone will be supplied to these contracts, which include
resurfacing a tolled section of Interstate 90 between Grafton and Framingham
for the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority.
The company has also won contracts to supply materials to two major projects
in downtown Boston. 17,000 cubic yards of readymix concrete will be supplied
to Turner Construction, which has won the contract to build the New England
Medical Centre, and more than 400,000 tons of aggregates are to be supplied
to Spectacle Island, part of the Dollars 6bn Boston Harbour clean-up scheme.
In Washington DC and Maryland, Evered Bardon's Mid-Atlantic division has won
contracts to supply more than Dollars 6m of materials. Over 300,000 tons of
aggregates will be supplied to the Government Federal Triangle building in
Washington DC and a similar quantity is to be railed and barged to the
Patuxent Naval Air Station in southern Maryland for a major resurfacing
contract.
The company has also been awarded the contract to supply 20,000 cubic yards
of readymix concrete to the Baltimore City Jail Annexe. Construction begins
this month. Aggregates for the concrete on this project will be supplied via
Evered Bardon's second aggregates rail terminal in the region, which opened
late last month at Canton in Baltimore City.

FT  10 MAY 93 / People: Two move to invest in Save &amp; Prosper
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fund management group Save &amp; Prosper has two new board members, Mark White
(right), who moves from within the Robert Fleming Group, and Steen Steincke
who was previously with Hafnia, the Danish insurer whose parent company went
into receivership last August.
White returns to the UK after seven years in Hong Kong, to replace
52-year-old Simon Walters as investment director in charge of the fund
management performance of Save &amp; Prosper. Walters in turn goes back to Hong
Kong where he prefers living, to become head of international investment
operations at Jardine Fleming. Both Jardine Fleming and Save &amp; Prosper are
subsidiaries of the Robert Fleming Group.
Just 37, White joined Flemings from Oxford in 1976 as an analyst. Latterly a
director of Jardine Fleming Holdings and Jardine Fleming Investment
Management, White was also chairman of the Hong Kong Unit Trust Association.
Paul Bateman, S&amp;P's chief executive, said it was appropriate at this stage
of his career for him to return to a UK-based job. Save &amp; Prosper has long
had the reputation of being a slumbering giant, although Walters was able to
achieve some improvement in investment performance.
Meanwhile Steincke, a 44-year-old Dane who speaks six languages, joins in
the newly created role of director of European retail operations. The job
had previously been included in Bateman's remit; the creation of a separate
role reflects the growing importance of the Continent - principally France,
Luxembourg and Spain - to Flemings. Bateman says that Steincke had been
looking for a job with a European perspective which he had missed in his
last assignment as chief executive of Hafnia Holdings UK. The group says
Hafnia's fate was not relevant to the decision to hire him, and that
Steincke had an impressive previous track record. Between 1986-1990 Steincke
was president of Hafnia Bank in Copenhagen before moving to London to become
managing director of Prolific Financial Management in London. Hafnia has now
sold the Prolific life insurance operation to Scottish Provident.

FT  10 MAY 93 / People: Ugland to take over chair of ship repairers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Andreas O Ugland, a member of the Norwegian shipping family and chairman of
Ugland Brothers, the UK-based ship management company, has been appointed
chairman-designate of Bristol Channel Ship Repairers.
Ugland is expected to take over the chairmanship in the autumn when Bristol
Channel's current chairman, Christopher Bailey, steps down.
His appointment appears to mark the end of a sometimes acrimonious battle
for control of the group waged over the past nine months.
Ugland is Bristol Channel's largest shareholder. It has built up a 24.19 per
cent stake, the bulk of which was acquired in July when the company bought
18m shares from CH Bailey, which also operates dry dock facilities in the
Bristol Channel. This cut Bailey's holding to 8.21 per cent.
In March a bid by Ugland to seize control of the board at an extraordinary
meeting was backed by shareholders but foiled when Bailey called a surprise
board meeting the day before the EGM and appointed five new directors.
However, it appears that since then the two sides have reached a better
understanding. John Love, one of three Ugland directors on the board, says
Bailey had recognised that the move was in the best interest of all the
shareholders.

FT  10 MAY 93 / People: Academic to steer strategy for Clydesdale Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Clydesdale Bank, the Glasgow-based clearing bank which belongs to National
Australia Bank, is bringing in outside blood and, it expects, new ideas with
two appointments. They follow the arrival as ceo last year of Charles Love,
formerly director of branch banking with TSB and ceo of TSB Bank Scotland.
Catherine Smith, an academic authority on banking, has been appointed to the
newly created post of head of strategic development, joining the executive
management committee and reporting directly to Love.
Holding a doctorate in economics from Glasgow University, she has been a
consultant and conference speaker, advising clients in financial services in
Europe and North America on strategy.
Her reputation grew from a big study of computerisation in the Scottish
clearing banks, followed up by a series of management books on banking
technology and strategy, of which the most recent is entitled 'Tomorrow's
success - profitable strategies from the finance industry'.
Clydesdale hopes she will help it to become 'a little more visionary, not
looking only at the day-to-day'.
The bank has also appointed a new general manager of its finance division.
He is Peter Aslett, who joins from British Petroleum where he was
vice-president for finance and chief financial officer with Tex/Con Oil &amp;
Gas in Houston Texas. Before that he worked for ICI both in the UK and the
US. He succeeds the long serving Jim McNeillage who has left the bank,
'taking with him our very best wishes'.

TRAFALGAR HOUSE CONSTRUCTION companies have won three new contracts worth
nearly Pounds 15m for building and civil engineering work in the UK and
overseas.
Trollope &amp; CoIls has a repair and refurbishment contract valued at
approximately Pounds 6.5m at 40 St Mary Axe, which was damaged in last
year's explosion in the City. The year-long contract involves repairing the
Portland stone facade as well as doors, staircases and ceilings, and
replacing windows, plant and internal services.
The regional business of Trafalgar House Construction has two contracts
worth nearly Pounds 5m for the refurbishment and installation of internal
sanitation at HM Prison in Stafford, and the design and construction of
student accommodation at the University of Teesside.
Overseas, Cemindia has been awarded a Pounds 3.5m contract to construct a
290 metre multi-purpose berth at the port of Paradip in India.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Bomb measures 'could cost Pounds 50m'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COST of protecting the NatWest Tower, Britain's second tallest building,
from the worst effects of a terrorist bomb could be between Pounds 25m and
Pounds 50m, a study by construction specialists says.
Offices would still be seriously damaged if the explosion was large and
close enough. Terrorists in Northern Ireland have exploded bombs up to
3,000kgs, three times the size of the explosion which ripped through the
tower and damaged other buildings in the City of London two weeks ago.
Gardiner &amp; Theobald, chartered surveyors, and Mott MacDonald, consulting
engineers, say that to make large office buildings more bomb-resistant -
including installing tough ened glass, strengthening window-frames,
thickening lower exterior walls and strengthening the buildings' frames -
could cost an extra Pounds 50 to Pounds 100 per sq ft. This would almost
double reconstruction costs.
The groups say they are not necessarily advocating that companies should pay
this sort of money for extra protection.
Mr Jim Kay, a Gardiner &amp; Theobald director, said: 'They must decide what
level of protection they need and can afford.'
The firms have produced a guide showing the cost of various options. These
range from installing a simple plastic film to protect windows to
reinforcing walls.

BRITISH Petroleum is expected to announce plans today to go ahead with a
project for eight or nine oil and gas fields in the central North Sea,
Deborah Hargreaves writes.
The Eastern Trough Area Project, involving eight companies including Shell
and Esso, is to go forward sooner than planned because of changes to the oil
tax regime proposed in the Budget.
It is expected to cost Pounds 600m to Pounds 1bn to bring the fields into
production by 1998. They are believed to contain between 600m and 1bn
barrels of oil and more than 1,000bn cu ft of gas.

FT  10 MAY 93 / MacGregor rules out toll booths
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MacGregor, the transport secretary, last night promised that
motorists in the UK would never face the prospect of paying road charges at
Continental-style toll booths.
He warned, however, that ways had to be found of charging for the use of
motorways to fund completion of the Pounds 19bn building programme.
Mr MacGregor was speaking as he arrived in Oslo for a two-day tour of road
charging systems in Scandinavia.
He said he wanted to stimulate a public debate on the possibility of
charging people for the use of the roads but ruled out the idea of
Continental toll booths because they would slow down traffic and take up too
much land.
He said the idea of using charges to tackle congestion in London and other
built-up areas posed problems because the necessary technology was not ready
and decisions had to be taken on issues such as who should be exempted.
He would not decide on urban road pricing until early 1995, after completion
of a Department of Transport study, but Britain had to discuss motorway
charges much earlier than that because public-sector finance alone would not
fund completion of the road programme by the end of the decade.
One option would be to see whether existing electronic technology would
provide an answer. Another would be a system similar to that of Switzerland,
where drivers pay SFr30 (Pounds 13.50) for an annual licence to use
motorways.
Mr MacGregor said the paper setting out the options would appear in four to
six weeks.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Huge popularity predicted for lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Lottery planned for the UK could be played every week by most
of the population, with more people watching the live draw every Saturday
night than watch Coronation Street, Raymond Snoddy writes.
A report published today by the GAH consultancy group predicts a significant
impact for the lottery, to be launched next year in aid of 'good causes'.
The report says that in many states and provinces of the US and Canada the
lottery has become the largest contributor to government revenues.
In some countries, such as Norway, the national lottery is the largest
business, it says.
The UK national lottery could become the largest lottery in Europe, ahead of
France and Spain, and could generate sales of between Pounds 2.5bn and
Pounds 6bn. The report says: 'We believe Pounds 4bn to Pounds 4.5bn is an
achievable target.'
It says success will depend on the percentage of sales allocated to the
licence holder for operating costs, the number of retail agents needed to
achieve national coverage and the running of instant games.

WHITEHALL should better co-ordinate its activities in training and
education, say directors of the 82 Tecs in England and Wales.
The finding is one of several in the FT's survey which questioned the
working relationships within the government and those between Whitehall and
Tecs. These are the bodies contract with a number of government departments,
including education, employment and trade and industry, to provide training
and enterprise activities.
One third of directors want a much more fundamental co-ordination of
ministerial responsibilities, suggesting that Tecs should emulate Scotland
where their equivalents, Local Economic Councils (Lecs), have strong parent
bodies - Scottish Enterprise and the Highlands and Islands Enterprise. These
statutory bodies fund the Lecs and devolve activities to them - not only
training, but also the economic development powers of the Scottish
Development Agency.
Going down this route would require radical reform in Whitehall, to include
concentrating regional aid under one wing.
A recurring theme is the need for a stronger focus by departments on
activities that involve Tecs. One businessman says: 'Far too little has been
done to unite all the diverse bodies involved in, say, tackling
unemployment. The operation is fragmented beyond belief. At the government
level there are three departments all coming at the problem from different
angles and at the local level there are county councils, district councils,
the Employment Service and Tecs, all with different priorities.'
When it comes to their own priorities, directors are forthright. Sixty three
per per cent rate economic development as their priority, including job
creation. Only 17 per cent say training the unemployed is their top
priority.
A total of 68 per cent of directors believe the amount of money the
government spends on training via the Tecs is too low, while only 2 per cent
say it is too high.
Many are still pessimistic about the government's approach to promoting the
training of those in work. Forty nine per cent of directors generally - and
39 per cent of executives - advocate a statutory training levy, rather than
leaving it up to the company.
Just under half - 46 six per cent - back Workfare, one of the most
controversial proposals, which would force specific groups of the unemployed
to work or undertake training in return for benefits.
On the whole, the directors are generally enthusiastic over government
initiatives - more than 80 per cent welcome the pilots for a scheme under
which employers are given a subsidy to take on someone who has been without
work for a long time. One director says: 'This scheme should be extended
nationwide. It just may give companies that extra bit of confidence to
employ another person that they could not really afford.'

BEING an unpaid director of one of the 82 Training and Enterprise Councils
in England and Wales is a time-consuming activity.
A total of 56 per cent of the 506 respondents to the survey of 1,220 Tec
directors said they spent more than three hours a week on Tec-related
activities. Twenty eight per cent of those said the Tec took more than six
hours a week - an increase from 16 per cent last year.
The recession has caused many directors, particularly from the private
sector - who have to be of chief-executive status - to question their
commitment to outside activities. But only one said he was leaving his Tec
because of the time factor.
And 91 per cent said they intended to spend more than two years with their
Tec - only 45 per cent expressed such a committment last year.
Representatives of trade unions, who made up nearly 5 per cent of the
survey, were as prepared to stay the course as the private-sector
executives, who accounted for 68 per cent of respondents. The remainder were
public-sector officers.
Most found the overall progress of Tecs to be satisfactory but only 17 per
cent were very satisfied compared with 26 per cent last year. Ten per cent
said progress was very unsatisfactory compared with 7 per cent last year.
Union and public-sector representatives were the most critical.

DIRECTORS of Tecs had plenty to say when asked how tackle unemployment
should be tackled.
Their proposals included:
Creating a national economic strategy based on support for manufacturing
industry and statutory regional development agencies.
Increasing public spending on capital projects to kick-start the economy and
create jobs.
Halting the fragmentation of local government services which 'provide a
major source of local and community employment'.
Continuing to resist the social chapter.
Sacking Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor.
Further cuts in interest rates and corporate tax cuts.
Creating new measures for inward investors which 'will convince them that
the UK is the most attractive location in Europe'.
Encouraging local chambers of commerce to take the lead in creating export
opportunities. Getting 'the banks under control' and preventing them from
destroying viable small businesses.
Greater co-ordination of government departments involved in education,
training and enterprise.
Creating structured partnerships among the several bodies responsible for
developing local economies.
Changing the balance of Tec funding to favour enterprise, not training, and
allowing Tecs more discretion in setting local priorities.
Putting effort into re-skilling and enhancing the skills of the employed.
This would create a 'pull-through' of vacancies for the unemployed.
Raising the status of part-time work by ensuring that pay and benefits
correspond to full-time employment, while 'recognising and developing a
culture that accepts that full-time work and employment as we now know it
will not be possible in the future'.
Allowing people to take on more part-time work before losing benefits.
Cutting tax for the low-paid and eliminating the 'poverty trap' of lost
benefits on returning to work.
Reducing taxation in the first year for the long-term unemployed returning
to work.
Subsidising employers to retrain workers they intend to make redundant.
Providing financial incentives to employers to take on the unemployed, such
as paying most benefits to the employer for up to six months.
Considering subsidies for companies which are considering compulsory
redundancies to assist them through a bad patch, when they might be panicked
into making people redundant and subsequently find they have over-sacked.
Improving the careers service.
Creating financial incentives for small companies to take on staff - for
example charging no national insurance in the first year.
Building on existing training initiatives rather than creating new ones.
Creating a national community service programme for people aged 18 to 19.
Resurrecting the Community Programme work experience scheme in areas of high
unemployment.
Relaxing the rules surrounding Tec training and the enterprise allowance
scheme. 'It is foolish for people to have to be unemployed for six months
before they can be trained to set up their own business,' said one director.
Allowing greater flexibilities in applying the 21-hour rule to allow
unemployed people to study for more than 21 hours without losing benefit.
This would allow unemployed people over 21 to return to full-time education
or training without loss of benefit.

90 per cent expect to spend more than two years with the Tec
28 per cent spend more than six hours a week on Tec-related activities
72 per cent are satisfied with Tecs' progress generally, the greatest level
of dissatisfaction being expressed by members of trade unions
78 per cent believe Tecs should be the subject of minor evolutionary reform.
 Trade union members are again the most critical with 37 per cent alling for
drastic reform
68 per cent believe the government's spending on training via Tecs is too
low
49 per cent believe there should be a levy on business to pay for training
people in work.  Nearly 40 per cent of business executives share this view
A majority are unhappy with the current intermediary body between Tecs and
government - called G10 and made up of 10 Tec chairmen.  30 per cent of
critics of G10 want a stronger intermediary body, along the lines of
Scottish Enterprise, which funds the Scottish equivalent of Tecs
Youth Training, the government-funded scheme for 16-19 year olds, is seen as
important or very important by 96 per cent of directors
78 per cent favour a 'universal credit' which would entitle all 16-19 year
olds to full and part-time education and training
51 per cent say a department of education and training should be created
43 per cent believe the government's new Training for Work scheme for the
adult jobless, with its emphasis on payment for getting people into jobs or
gaining qualifications, could force Tecs to discriminate against individuals
who need a lot of help
30 per cent say the relationship between their Tec and the local careers
services is unsatisfactory
90 per cent say their Tecs relationship with schools is either very good or
good
51 per cent are satisfied with the progress of Investors in People - the
scheme to improve training of people in work - in their areas.  33 say they
are dissatisfied
70 per cent of directors' own companies or, in the case of trade union
members and local authority representatives, are committed to being awarded
IIP.
54 per cent believe the promotion of Inward Investment into their area is
inadequate
56 per cent are in favour of some form of workfare targeted at specific

FT  10 MAY 93 / Huge popularity seen for lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Lottery planned for the UK could be played every week by most
of the population with more people watching the live draw every Saturday
night than watch Coronation Street.
Such a significant impact for the lottery, to be launched next year in aid
of ' good causes ', is predicted in an independent report on the national
lottery published today. )
The report, by the GAH consultancy group, says that in many states and
provinces of the US and Canada the lottery has become the largest
contributor to government revenues.
In some countries, such as Norway, the national lottery is the largest
business.
The success of lotteries has brought criticism in other countries,
particularly the US, where jackpots have exceeded Dollars 100m (Pounds
64.90m).
The licence to operate the national lottery in the UK 'represents a major
business opportunity, not only for the successful bidders, but for suppliers
and UK retailers who become lottery agents,' the report says.
The UK national lottery could become the largest lottery in Europe, ahead of
France and Spain, and could generate ticket sales of between Pounds 2.5bn
and Pounds 6bn.
The report says: 'We believe Pounds 4bn to Pounds 4.5bn is an achievable
target.'
Success will depend on the percentage of sales allocated to the licence
holder for operating costs, the number of retail agents needed to achieve
national coverage and the running of instant games as well as lotto.
Retail outlets would be particularly important.
The report says: 'It is difficult to see how the lottery will achieve its
potential without the support of some of the major retailers such as J
Sainsbury, Tesco, Asda, WH Smith, J Menzies, BP, Shell, Esso and Texaco
among others.'

FT  10 MAY 93 / Pounds 50m to protect NatWest tower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COST of protecting the NatWest Tower, Britain's second tallest building,
from the worst effects of a terrorist bomb could be between Pounds 25m and
Pounds 50m, a study by construction specialists says.
Offices would still be seriously damaged if the explosion was large and
close enough. Terrorists in Northern Ireland have exploded bombs up to
3,000kgs, three times the size of the explosion which ripped through the
tower and damaged other buildings in the City of London two weeks ago.
Gardiner &amp; Theobald, chartered surveyors, and Mott MacDonald, consulting
engineers, say that to make large office buildings more bomb-resistant -
including installing toughened glass, strengthening window-frames,
thickening lower exterior walls and strengthening the buildings' frame -
could cost an extra Pounds 50 to Pounds 100 per sq ft.
This would almost double reconstruction costs which, depending on
specifications and scale of the building, could themselves be in excess of
Pounds 100 per sq ft.
The groups - experienced in designing protected buildings, from hardened
submarine pens to embassies - say they are not necessarily advocating that
companies should pay this sort of money for extra protect-ion.
Mr Jim Kay, a Gardiner &amp; Theobald director, said: 'They must decide what
level of protection they need and can afford. They must evaluate the scale
of risk faced by staff and to the smooth running of their business,
including the cost of dislocation if computer systems are destroyed or they
have to find temporary accommodation.'
To help the owners of buildings they have produced a guide showing the cost
of various options. These range from the cheapest - installing a simple
plastic film to protect windows, at Pounds 1 per sq ft - to more expensive
items, such as adding toughened glass, reinforcing walls and strengthening
or removing suspended ceilings.
Some of the most costly damage, other than structural damage, has been
caused by the collapse of false ceilings enclosing expensive and
highly-sensitive communication systems, said Mr Kay.
Many companies already have back-up computers and services in case of
breakdown. Mr Alastair Walker, a director of Advance Mechanics &amp; Engineering
a Mott MacDonald associate, said these should be installed at diagonally
opposite ends of the building or in shock-proof safe havens.
He said information should be passed regularly to back-up computers. The
loss of business records for just one hour could cost City traders tens of
millions of pounds. Water tanks should be strengthened. These, if fractured,
can cause almost as much damage as the original explosion.
Where buildings are most vulnerable lower walls might be reinforced.
Deflectors could then be installed to protect upper floors.
Designers of new buildings might consider terracing upper floors to allow
the effects of an explosion to dissipate as the blast travelled upwards.
Joints between pillars and beams might be strengthened, particularly in
concrete-framed buildings, which are more likely to crack or fracture in a
large explosion.
Mr Kay said: 'In the final analysis, there is no such thing as a bomb-proof
building. The best protection is vigilance to ensure that terrorists cannot
get close enough to cause damage.'

FT  10 MAY 93 / City blast worsens scaffold shortage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCALE of repairs following the Bishopsgate bomb a fortnight ago is
exacerbating a shortage of scaffolding, suppliers say, writes Andrew Taylor.
Mr John Cripps, president of the National Association of Scaffolding
Contractors, said demand for scaffolding had increased substantially
following the bombing.
'I was at an auction of second-hand equipment in south London last week and
prices were up to 30 per cent higher than three or four weeks earlier,' said
Mr Cripps, director of Plant &amp; Tools, which supplies south London and
south-east England.
The association said shortages of scaffolding were emerging before the
bombing, because of closures and cuts by companies during the recession.
This was likely to lead to price rises as construction activity started to
improve, particularly house-building.
It said that during the recession prices for contract scaffolding had fallen
by as much as 40 per cent in some regions.
The association said shortages had been exacerbated by large sales of
second-hand equipment for use in reconstruction following the Gulf War. The
result was the lowest level of scaffolding stocks for many years. Delivery
periods for many items were now exceeding four to five weeks.
It added that the rise in steel prices announced by British Steel was likely
to have an effect on scaffolding prices.

FT  10 MAY 93 / BBC outlines new business strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC has outlined to the government a new strategy for its commercial
operations in its response to the green paper on the future of the
corporation.
The strategy is designed to answer criticism that the corporation has abused
its privileged position to compete unfairly in the market with other
television groups and publishers.
The ITV companies, for example, last week attacked the BBC's involvement in
UK Gold, an advertising-funded satellite channel. In the past publishers
have criticised the way the BBC used its airwaves to promote its magazines.
Mr Bob Phillis, the new deputy director-general, said the aim had been to
produce a coherent and defensible policy for participating in commercial
activities.
'That does not mean legitimising everything we have done in the past nor
does it mean restricting ourselves from opportunities that may exist in the
future,' Mr Phillis said.
He declined to elaborate in advance of publication of the BBC's green paper
document later this month but added: 'We will be looking always for a link
to our core purpose as programme makers.' Money earned by the corporation
through commercial activities goes back into programmes.
The new policy outlined in response to the government is designed not only
to be fair to the marketplace but to be seen to be fair. It will be the
first time the BBC has drawn up and published detailed criteria governing
commercial activities.
However, it seems unlikely that the BBC will be pulling out of
advertising-funded operations around the world, although launching magazines
not directly linked to programmes may come into question in future.
Mr Phillis is also chairing a new commercial and business sub-committee of
the board of management to work out in detail the new policy.
Mr Phillis said: 'By the end of July a small tight sub committee will be up
and running. We will have declared and established a coherent commercial
strategy for the organisation,' said Mr Phillis.
In his first interview since taking over as deputy director-general six
weeks ago the former chief executive of Independent Television News also
defended Producer Choice, the system of giving production departments the
freedom to buy the services they need on the open market - a system which
started at the beginning of last month.
Mr Phillis said: 'When the system is fully operational and if it works in
the way that it is intended the BBC will be a more efficient organisation.
There will be more money going into programmes.' He accepted, however, that
the benefits were not likely to flow in full from day one because of the
complexity of the change and the enormous impact it will have on how the BBC
works. For the first time BBC services are fully-costed and producers can go
whereever they can find the best quality and price.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Lloyd's faces call for meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD's of London is likely to be forced to call an extraordinary general
meeting next month to consider whether members should vote before corporate
capital can be introduced into the insurance market.
The meeting has been demanded by Mr Claud Gurney, a disaffected member of
the market, who is collecting 100 signatures, enough under the market's
rules to force it to call an extraordinary general meeting. He expects to
deliver the signatures to Lloyd's today.
The main resolution to be put at the meeting would force Lloyd's to hold a
vote before allowing the introduction of newcomers with limited liability.
This move was a centrepiece of the restructuring plan to rebuild Lloyd's
capital base that it unveiled 11 days ago.
Mr Gurney said he believed that Lloyd's should have to win the agreement of
two-thirds of its existing Names, who have unlimited personal liability,
before making the change. He believed that in order to win the agreement of
the Names, Lloyd's would have to put together a package in which future
Names would help existing Names.
He said: 'We want an agreement whereby 25 per cent of future profits be paid
to past Names.'
Mr Gurney's move was criticised by Mr Val Powell, chief executive of the
Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents more than 9,000 Names.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Vulnerable Lamont dogged by Tory calls for his departure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN Lamont will this week try to shrug off mounting criticism of his
economic stewardship - but he faces an insurmountable task in squashing
speculation of his removal in a summer reshuffle.
Ministers yesterday acknowledged that the chancellor had become a lightning
conductor for Tory MPs' alarm over the whole government's performance and
argued that personal criticism of him was unfair.
But Downing Street and cabinet ministers have done little to counter
suggestions that Mr John Major will reshuffle his cabinet around the summer
recess at the end of July.
With Mr Lamont's reputation already damaged following Britain's traumatic
exit from the European exchange rate mechanism, there is now a widespread
belief at Westminster that he is too great a liability to be saved. He may,
however, be offered the dignity of another senior cabinet post.
No cabinet minister has speculated publicly on how long Mr Lamont will
remain at the Treasury, but the number of senior Tories who are privately
urging his removal is growing.
In a speech to the Scottish Tory party conference on Wednesday Mr Lamont
will attempt to rebuild confidence that the government's economic policies
will lead to sustainable economic growth.
Yet the audience's reaction may show the depth of Mr Lamont's unpopularity
among Tory activists - even though criticism after Thursday's election
results is strongest in the traditional Conservative heartlands of southern
England.
Among grassroots Tories there is contempt at Mr Lamont's ability to dismiss
the volte face over the ERM without appreciating the recession's impact on
individual lives. There is a perception too that Mr Major tried for too long
last year to save Mr David Mellor as national heritage secretary and that
the same mistake should not be repeated.
Mr Lamont's 'je ne regrette rien' remark during the Newbury by-election was
seen as insensitive, smacking of arrogance where contrition would have
fitted better.
In the short term Mr Lamont is probably safe. He himself argues that the
prime minister cannot be bounced into decisions by press hounding. In
comments which, perhaps deliberately fell short of fulsome backing, Mr
Kenneth Clarke, home secretary and a possible successor as chancellor, said
yesterday: 'It is the unfairness of the treatment of Norman that has caused
his colleagues to rally to him in recent months.'
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, and tipped as another
possibility for the chancellorship, said on BBC television that the
chancellor had been the victim of a 'virulent press campaign'.
To an extent they are right that the treatment of Mr Lamont is too
personalised. To some Tory MPs he is a scapegoat - to blame Mr Lamont is
easier than voicing fears that the problems facing the government under Mr
Major go far wider.
But the vicissitudes of politics mean scapegoats are inevitable when a party
is in trouble. Mr Lamont, who was appointed chancellor when Mrs Margaret
Thatcher was toppled as prime minister, would not be the first to complain
at the injustices of politics.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Output forecast to rise by 3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURING is poised for a relatively strong recovery with output growth
of about 3 per cent this year and 4.5 per cent next year, Lloyds Bank says
in a report today.
Mr Patrick Foley, the bank's chief economic adviser, says that the surge in
manufacturing growth will be prompted by the boost to competitiveness that
resulted from sterling leaving the European exchange rate mechanism last
year. This cut the price of UK manufactured goods by about 15 per cent
compared with international competitors.
Manufacturing growth has been helped by a reduction in unit labour costs to
very low levels. Mr Foley believes that labour costs in the sector will have
been cut by 21 per cent relative to overseas competitors in the first year
following sterling's exit from the ERM.
Mr Foley says: 'The change restores our price competitiveness to late 1980s
levels when UK industry was gaining share in world markets, partly through
improvements in non-price competitiveness.'
He also believes that substantial spare capacity exists in manufacturing and
that output could grow by an average of 10 per cent across manufacturing
sectors without meeting capacity limits. 'This has important implications
for inflation because it suggests there is considerable scope for output
growth without pressure on prices.'

FT  10 MAY 93 / Major engulfed by recriminations: The fallout from last
week's elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservatives have not lost their capacity to panic. Reeling from the
shock of last week's elections, the party which once claimed unity as the
bedrock of its success was engulfed at the weekend by accusations and
recriminations.
The inevitable - but ever more serious - calls for Mr Norman Lamont's
replacement at the Treasury were accompanied by perhaps a dozen other, often
conflicting, prescriptions for the government's ills.
Some on the less-than-steady Tory back benches called for a wholesale
shake-out of the cabinet. Others demanded a referendum on the Maastricht
treaty. Yet others wanted a truce with the teachers over school tests.
Some demanded drastic cuts in public spending to restore the government's
sound finance credentials. Others said that Mr John Major has already
compromised too much his appeal as a caring Conservative. A programme to
chip away at the welfare state would be catastrophic.
Nor were the divisions confined to the back benches. Mr Michael Portillo,
the chief secretary at the Treasury, told television viewers that all would
be well as long as the government stuck to controlling inflation, reducing
borrowing, and reducing the role of the state.
Simultaneously, a decidedly less sanguine Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home
secretary, was telling a radio audience that the government needed to a new
agenda to get out of its 'dreadful hole'.
The overall effect was to magnify the impression of disarray. And amid the
alarm came the thinly-veiled hints from some that Mr Major's authority was
now in question: that unless he restored a grip on the government he could
face a challenge to his leadership in the autumn.
If there is a such challenge - and that remains a slim possibility rather
than a probability - it will be a token one. Mounted by the band of about 30
or so hardline Tory Euro-sceptics, its aim would be to wound the prime
minister rather than to replace him.
There is no alternative figure in the cabinet ready to precipitate a
leadership contest. The sceptics do not have a leader on the back benches
comparable to Mr Michael Heseltine for whom a 'stalking horse' candidate
might act as a proxy.
But the fact that there is even a possibility of such a challenge carries
two important messages for Mr Major.
The first is that the implacable opponents of the Maastricht treaty on the
Tory back benches have now established a party-within-a-party.
With its own 'whipping' system at Westminster to ensure loyalty and a
fanatical devotion to its cause, the group's approach bears striking
similarities to Militant, the leftwing extremists who inflicted so much
damage on Labour during the 1980s.
The second, and more important, lesson that many in his cabinet want Mr
Major to draw is that he must strengthen the support of his natural
constituency on the party's centre-left.
These are the ministers and MPs who rallied last year behind the prime
minister's commitment to combine the free-market economics of the Thatcher
era with the traditional Tory 'one-nation' approach to social policy.
They feel that Mr Major should now move quickly to replace Mr Lamont. Many
believe that he has compromised too much in his efforts to pacify the
Euro-sceptics and other malcontents on the right of the party. They want the
more robust approach to dissidents adopted by Mr Clarke.
As one put it: 'John (Major) has to be nice to his friends as well as to his
enemies.' Amid a cascade of contradictory advice, that is likely to prove
the most important.

FT  10 MAY 93 / House prices to rise 'steadily'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES will rise steadily in most of the UK this year, although there
is unlikely to be a surge in property values either this year or next year,
says the UK economics team at Morgan Grenfell, the investment bank.
In a report issued yesterday it says that the housing market is on the road
to recovery and that prices will rise at or above the rate of inflation next
year, with an increase of 5 per cent for the UK as a whole.
They believe that the scale of the price rise is likely to be held back
because the recent slump in the property market has diminished the
percep-tion of borrowers and banks of housing as an invest-ment.
The report says that the problem of negative equity remains a constraint on
the market.
Morgan Grenfell estimates that 2m households have mortgages higher than the
value of their houses, a figure equivalent to one in five people with
mortgages.
It estimates that the average value of negative equity is Pounds 8,500 and
that 75 per cent of those with negative equity are first-time buyers.
The report says that house-price inflation of 5 per cent a year should, by
itself, reduce the number in negative equity by about 50 per cent to just
under 1m by the end of 1995 and to zero by the end of the decade.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Treasury considers trying out a newer model: Peter Marsh on
moves to update software for economic forecasting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER London Zoo and the Royal Family another well-loved British institution
is under threat. The Treasury model - a set of computer programs depicting
how the UK economy works - could be replaced by rival software under one
option being considered by government officials.
The demise of the 20-year-old model would have a big effect on how the
Treasury prepares its economic forecasts.
The Treasury model has entered the spotlight partly because of the
inadequacies of the Treasury's recent forecasts, which in common with many
private-sector projections failed to spot either the 1986-88 boom or the
seriousness of the recession before it was too late.
Although the model can hardly take the full blame for the poor predictions -
other important factors include the judgments made by Treasury economists
and the political 'spin' imparted to projections by ministers - Treasury
officials concede the software in the model has not been kept sufficiently
up to date.
They have asked academic experts from Strathclyde University and Warwick
University to improve aspects of the model concerned with labour markets and
consumer spending.
In the US the job of preparing economics forecasts on behalf of President
Bill Clinton's administration is shared by the so-called 'economics troika'
 -the US Treasury, the Office of Management and Budget and the Council of
Economic Advisers. All use private-sector models.
A senior administration official said: 'Contracting out modelling gives us
greater flexibility. It also improves our credibility because people know we
are using independent economic analysis.'
Mr Bob Dennis, assistant economics director at the Congressional Budget
Office, said: 'By piggybacking on work done outside the government we get
the best of whatever expertise is available.'
Massachusetts-based DRI, the world's biggest economics consultancy with
annual sales of about Dollars 60m (Pounds 38.90), and McKibbin Software
Group, a small modelling company in Washington DC, are among several US
groups which supply models to the US agencies. DRI charges about Dollars
20,000 a year for its software, including help in forecasts and monthly
updating of the computer code to allow for economic fluctuations.
DRI and McKibbin have indicated interest in supplying the UK Treasury with
their own versions of modelling software for the UK economy. DRI economists
outlined their thinking to the Treasury at a meeting in January.
From the UK, Business Strategies, a small London-based economics
consultancy, would 'definitely be interested' in selling the UK Treasury
modelling software, according to Mr Charles Burton, joint managing director.
The Treasury is also evaluating UK models run by the London Business School
and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research as candidates for
internal use, possibly in conjunction with the existing Treasury model.
Mr Warwick McKibbin, founder of McKibbon Software Group, thinks that
whatever the result of the review at the UK Treasury, it should buy other
models to use alongside its own. 'Anyone interested in the economy should
have access to two or three models because they all have their own strengths
and weaknesses,' he said.
The Treasury model, which runs on desk-top computers, is used to simulate
how a set of policy actions such as changes in interest rates affect
variables such as consumer spending or jobs vacancies.
It comprises more than 100 mathematical equations linking variables such as
unemployment, inflation and budget deficits.
It is tended by a team of 30 Treasury economists. They are answerable to Mr
Alan Budd, who is the department's chief economic adviser.
Dozens, if not hundreds, of models are used worldwide to simulate activities
in specific economies. They differ from each other largely in the way their
equations link up variables and how easy they are to use.
Any decision to scrap the Treasury model and rely entirely on the private
sector would come after the Treasury finishes its modelling review at the
end of the summer.
Mr John Watts, the Tory MP who is chairman of the Commons' Treasury and
Civil Service committee, supports the use of a greater range of models.
Referring to the Treasury's recently-appointed committee of outside economic
advisers, Mr Watts said: 'There would be an advantage to the Treasury having
more than one model. It's already got seven wise men, so why not seven wise
models?'
It could also open the door to a number of companies in the US and UK which
would like to sell their own economic models to the Treasury.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Pay rises 'below 3% for first time in 9 years'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AVERAGE PAY increases have dropped below 3 per cent for the first time in
nine years, with a quarter of settlements in the first three months of the
year worth 1.8 per cent or less, according to figures released today by
Industrial Relations Services, the independent pay research company.
It says in a report that the number of pay freezes has yet to peak, with one
in five employers among the latest batch to settle giving their workers no
increase or deferring rises.
In the three months to the end of March, settlements covering nearly 1m
employees dipped to 2.9 per cent, compared with 4.5 per cent a year ago.
This is the first time that the 3 per cent barrier has been breached since
IRS pay databank figures on about 1,000 bargaining groups became available
nine years ago.
IRS predicts that when public-sector pay deals, backdated to April, are
eventually included the level of increases will be pushed down even further.
Most public-sector staff covered by pay review bodies will receive 1.5 per
cent rises in line with the government's ceiling on public-sector pay.
IRS says that the only public-sector group likely to put up any real
resistance to the 1.5 per cent limit is the firefighters.
Their increase is not due until November but the Fire Brigades Union has
made clear that there is a risk of industrial action if local authority
employers do not honour a pay formula which links firefighters' earnings to
the top quarter of average male manual earnings.
The union's annual conference in Bridlington, Humberside, this week is
likely to discuss a strike ballot.
In the National Health Service pay negotiations which should have been
concluded in April are progressing slowly with different groups of workers
involved in what IRS calls a 'slow bicycle race'.
IRS says NHS unions are 'anxious to avoid reaching the stage of, say,
ballotting on industrial action over the 1.5 per cent first'.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Women close the jobs gap on men
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ESSEX WOMAN is more likely to have a paid job than Essex Man, government
statistics show.
Analysis of information gathered by the Department of Employment from about
400,000 employers indicates that Essex is just one of 11 areas in the UK
where women are more likely to go out to work than men.
There are now almost as many women in the workforce as there are men -
separate official figures show there were 10.7m men in employment at the end
of last year and 10.1m women. This contrasts with the position in 1979, when
there were 13.1m men and 9.4m women in jobs.
Nearly half of the jobs done by women are part-time, the latest figures
show.
According to Incomes Data Services, the independent pay and employment
research group which has analysed the employment census figures, part of the
explanation for the fall in unemployment in February and March this year
lies in the growth in part-time jobs in the service industries where women
are concentrated.
In the past six months unemployment among men hit its highest level since
the 1930s. It has risen much faster than unemployment among women, IDS says.
It adds that many of the sectors which have suffered most during the
recession of the past three years, including manufacturing and the energy
supply industries, employ far more men than women.
The Department of Employment survey figures, which are due to be published
in detail in two booklets, show that nine counties and two Scottish regions
now have more female than male employees.
These are: Essex, Isle of Wight, East Sussex, West Sussex, Cornwall/Scilly
Isles, Devon, Hereford and Worcester, Merseyside, Mid Glamorgan, and the
Borders and Lothian regions of Scotland.
East Sussex had the highest proportion of females in employment, at 54 per
cent, while the highest proportion of male employees - 57 per cent  - was
found in the Grampian region, the centre of North Sea oil operations.
Greater London had the highest concentration of full-time employees (80 per
cent) and of female full-timers - more than 31 per cent of all employees.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Ashdown renews approach to Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday tried to step up
pressure on the Labour party and his own colleagues to work in a broader
movement for political reform in Britain.
Without 'a re-shaping of British politics,' the Liberal Democrat and Labour
parties were in danger of drifting into irrelevance, Mr Ashdown said on BBC
television.
Labour's leadership remained cool about Liberal Democrat advances, insisting
that it was Mr Ashdown who should move towards them and not visa versa.
Neither party is talking about formal pacts.
A senior Labour party official denied reports that Mr John Smith, Labour
leader, might postpone decisions on the party's links with trade unions
beyond its autumn conference, a delay that would have provoked much Liberal
Democrat criticism.
In spite of swelling opposition among trade unionists, Mr Smith is
determined to push ahead with plans for ending the trade union's involvement
in elections for the party leadership and the selection of parliamentary
candidates.
Separately Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, was upbeat about
modernising the party's structure and policies. He said Labour had led the
way on democratic and constitutional reform: 'Of course if Liberal Democrat
supporters like it, that's fine,' he said.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Agreement near on drugs price plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINAL negotiations are expected to start today between the department of
health and the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry aimed at
concluding the scheme that sets the rate of return for drugs companies
operating in the UK.
Talks about the scheme, known as the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme,
started eight months ago.
One drugs group executive said: 'There is quite a lot of good will. We hope
to conclude the negotiations over the next few weeks, although there is
still quite a gap between what we want and the department's proposals.'
The industry is anxious to end the negotiations. The government needs to
save money on its drugs bill during this financial year and if the scheme is
not settled early ministers could be tempted to introduce a freeze on drugs
prices - or even price cuts similar to those recently introduced in Germany.
According to the association, the National Health Service drugs bill was
Pounds 3.49bn last year and is estimated to be increasing by between 12 per
cent and 14 per cent a year.
Meanwhile, the NHS advisory committee on drugs, set up to decide which drugs
within 10 therapeutic areas the NHS will no longer pay for, met on Thursday.
The committee is expected to publish its final conclusions soon on topical
anti-rheumatics, anti-diarrhoeal medicines, appetite suppressants and drugs
for vaginal and vulval conditions.
The association wants any recommendations to be the subject of full
parliamentary debate.
The committee is also expected to inform companies soon of its preliminary
recommendations on three other groups - hypnotics and anxiolitics, drugs
used in anaemia, and topical cortico-steroids.
The association is anxious that the rate of return on capital employed set
by the scheme should not be reduced.
It claims the rate, set at between 17 per cent and 21 per cent, is
reasonable and that the actual return is less than 10 per cent.
The association is also anxious to correct an element within the scheme
which appears to provide a disincentive for exporting. Under the present
complex rules any increase in exports in effect reduces permitted UK
profits.
American members of the association are known to be worried about measures
to control promotional expenditure, which is limited to about 9 per cent of
sales to the National Health Service.

FT  10 MAY 93 / MPs likely to attack cost of compact discs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporter
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MUSIC industry is expected to be criticised this week by a parliamentary
committee report questioning the prices charged for compact discs.
The report could be followed swiftly by an investigation by the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of the Office
of Fair Trading, hinted at the end of last month that a referral may be made
and that he would announce his decision in two to three weeks.
Judging by the attitude of MPs their report to be published on Wednesday is
likely to be highly critical. At ill-tempered public hearings of the
national heritage committee last month members from all parties accused
industry representatives of over-charging for CDs.
Sir Bryan said at committee hearings that he still had an open mind about
whether the UK music industry operated a complex monopoly on CDs. He added,
however: 'There is enough information there to make me concerned about the
situation.'
He said that the lower price of CDs in the US had persuaded him the issue
needed to be examined again, even though his predecessor, Sir Gordon Borrie,
found no reason to call for an MMC investigation as recently as April last
year.
Sir Gordon said then he could see little reason why CD prices were so high,
but that consumers appeared willing to pay the prices charged.
Sir Bryan told the the recent committee that matters which needed to be
explored included restrictions on CD imports from the US.
In a letter to the Financial Times today Mr John Deacon, director-general of
the British Phonographic Industry, denies that CD prices are 40 per cent
higher in the UK than in the US. He says that, taking exchange rates into
account, the difference is 10 per cent to 15 per cent.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Polly Peck creditors await administrators' report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS to Polly Peck will be waiting anxiously for the latest report from
the group's administrators at the end of this month after Mr Asil Nadir's
escape from bail to Cyprus last week.
Claims by Mr Nadir that he will attempt to regain control of companies in
the group are likely to de-stabilise attempts by accountants to recover
assets on creditors' behalf.
Mr Michael Jordan, one of the group's joint administrators at accountants
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said last week that he had been on the verge of an
agreement with the authorities in northern Cyprus to arrange sales of Polly
Peck assets.
He flew back to Istanbul at the end of the week in an attempt to safeguard
these arrangements.
Another accountant close to the discussions said: 'Negotiations were at a
delicate stage. Now the dust has to be allowed to settle.'
Coopers said a Turkish buyer was near to agreeing to pay Dollars 20m (Pounds
12.90m) for Meyna, the Turkish fruit business, and a Cypriot was 'shortly'
to pay about Dollars 10m for ICP, a pharmaceutical company.
Administrators are meeting early this week to discuss a more detailed
strategy on how to pursue their claims in the light of Mr Nadir's escape.
They are due to report to creditors again at the end of this month and so
far they are sticking to their projections made in October.
These suggested dividends in the range 0 to 4p or 4p to 10p. Which range
applied would depend on the unresolved assessment of how a Dollars 400m loan
from PPI to Holdings BV for Del Monte was routed.
Mr Jordan said no dividend was likely this year, although he might recommend
to creditors that Polly Peck moves from administration into a voluntary
arrangement or liquidation and insolvency procedures before then.
The Dollars 400m loan represents the difference between the group's
estimated liabilities in October 1990 of either Pounds 1.4bn or Pounds
1.6bn. Of the total, Pounds 632m is owed to banks and other creditors and
Pounds 287m to bondholders.
By October last year professional and legal fees and costs stood at Pounds
15.6m. There had been total payments of Pounds 66m and receipts of Pounds
68m, including realisations of non-core businesses and assets of Pounds 37m.
Del Monte was sold in November last year for Dollars 499m, of which net
proceeds left for distribution by the administrators are Dollars 218m.
The most significant remaining assets include an 86 per cent stake in
Vestel, which is quoted on the Istanbul stock exchange and an 18 per cent
stake in Sansui, the Tokyo-quoted electronics group.
Other outstanding assets in northern Cyprus include Unipac, Sunzest and
Voyager Kibris, which manages four hotels. Coopers said the total value was
about Dollars 40m, (Pounds 26m) but it could not give an exact sum since it
had been denied access to the accounts of the companies on the island.
The remaining prospects for creditors will come from any recoveries from
writs issued by Mr Christopher Morris at Touche Ross, another joint
administrator. These include Pounds 378m against Mr Nadir, Pounds 70m
against Citibank and possible future action against Stoy Hayward, Polly
Peck's auditors.
Touche said legal proceedings had already achieved a settlement for an
undisclosed amount against Impexbank, and it was pursuing judgments against
Mr Nadir's mother, the Industrial Bank of Kibris and Unipac.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ARYEH DERI, Israel's interior minister and head of the ultra-religious
Shas party - one of three partners in the Labour-led coalition of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin - yesterday submitted his resignation to the cabinet.
While the move threatens the fragile coalition, it is unlikely to bring
about the collapse of the government.
The coalition crisis was triggered when Mrs Shulamit Aloni, the secular
education minister and head of the left-wing Meretz party, refused to accept
an ultimatum issued by Shas that she resign.
The ultimatum was announced several days ago after remarks by Mrs Aloni
which Shas claimed were offensive to the religious.
Mr Deri's decision to leave the government has caused considerable anxiety
among Mr Rabin and his party colleagues, who are eager to have as broad a
coalition as possible behind them if Israel is asked to make tough decisions
on the peace process.
Mr Deri is the only member of Shas who sits in the cabinet. With Shas out of
the government, Mr Rabin's coalition will rest on a minority of 56 members
of parliament. An additional five MPs representing Arab parties are,
however, likely to support him outside the government on peace issues,
thereby ensuring that the government does not fall in any no-confidence
vote.
But Mr Rabin has in the past ruled out the possibility of undertaking
important moves on the sensitive issue of territorial compromise while
relying on the Arab parties for his majority vote in parliament.
It is therefore expected that in the next two days, until Mr Deri's
resignation takes effect, there will be intensive negotiations among the
coalition partners to ensure the government continues in its present
composition.
A likely solution to the crisis is a portfolio exchange, under which Mrs
Aloni would be removed from the Education Ministry and appointed to another
ministry, thereby enabling Shas to remain in the coalition.
Mr Rabin has said that if Meretz is seriously interested in promoting the
peace process, it will give up the education portfolio. Meretz insists,
however, it would be wrong to set a precedent of bowing to ultimatums issued
by the ultra-religious parties.

<TEXT>
THE three leading candidates in yesterday's presidential and congressional
elections in Paraguay were neck and neck as voting finished, and all parties
were celebrating victory.
According to one TV exit poll, the ruling Colorado party won 31 per cent of
the vote for their candidate, Mr Juan Carlos Wasmosy, with Mr Domingo Laino
of the Authentic Liberal Radical party gaining 29 per cent, and Mr Guillermo
Caballero Vargas, of the newly formed, pro-business Encuentro Nacional, 28
per cent. The poll also suggests the Colorado party will continue to be the
largest in Congress.
Another poll, however, gave Mr Laino the lead with 35 per cent, Mr Wasmosy
34 and Mr Caballero Vargas 30. The differences in the showing of the three
candidates are well within the margin of error of the polls.
About 200 international observers are in Paraguay for the elections. Some
irregularities were noted in the run-up to voting but were considered
unlikely to affect the result.
A close result could trigger a period of uncertainty in Paraguay. The
Colorado party has ruled since 1947 in league with the army, and there have
been doubts whether the military would allow power to pass to another party.
During the dictatorship of General Alfredo Stroessner the army was used to
mobilise voting in rigged elections.
An organisation carrying out a parallel count of votes yesterday had its
telephone lines cut, badly delaying the process.
Although some fraud was regarded as inevitable in yesterday's election,
opposition candidates might not accept the result should it be close.

President Hassan Gouled Aptidon of Djibouti has been re-elected to a fourth
six-year term, officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Djibouti.
Less than half the electorate voted in polls over the weekend which were
boycotted by supporters of the opposition Front for the Restoration of Unity
and Democracy. FRUD guerrillas control large areas in the north of the tiny
Red Sea republic.
Officials said Hassan, in power since independence in 1977, won 60.71 per
cent of the vote, making a second round unnecessary.

Senegalese lined up to vote yesterday in elections expected to win a few
more seats for the opposition but leave newly-re-elected President Abdou
Diouf with a majority in the national assembly, AP reports from Dakar.
The president's Socialist party currently has 103 assembly seats, to 17 for
the Democratic party of Abdoulaye Wade, chief opposition leader. Six parties

FT  10 MAY 93 / Rise in oil demand slows
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
World oil demand will rise only slightly this year to a little over 65m
barrels a day (b/d), OPEC Secretary-General Subroto said at the weekend,
according to Reuter in Vienna.
Mr Subroto said production by non-members of the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries would fall by about 1m b/d so that the cartel would have
to make good this shortfall. Demand would pick up particularly in the second
half of the year.

The Central Bank of Ireland is cutting two key interest rates, from today,
AP reports from Dublin.
The central bank said over the weekend that it was it was reducing to 8.50
per cent from 8.75 per cent the short-term rate it charges on loans to
commercial banks. It will also cut its overnight deposit rate to 5.25 per
cent from 5.50 per cent. That rate is applied to surplus money-market funds
that the central bank lends out overnight to commercial banks.

<TEXT>
SOUTH African President F W de Klerk and the African National Congress both
warned at the weekend that the mobilisation of right-wing whites could turn
South Africa into a new Bosnia, Patti Waldmeir reports from Johannesburg.
In a tough statement aimed at demonstrating to his nervous supporters that
the government is able to control left- and right-wing violence, Mr de Klerk
warned that 'extremists on the left or the right should not underestimate
the government's power and its resources'.
The ANC said: 'The people of South Africa will not . . . be blackmailed into
accepting schemes that seek to turn South Africa into another Bosnia.'
Both were reacting to moves last week to set up a united front of right-wing
parties to press for Afrikaner self-determination in constitutional
negotiations. Those talks have now reached a crucial point, with negotiators
promising to set a date for the first all-race elections - and agree
principles of a new constitution - within four weeks.

FT  10 MAY 93 / US seeks more evidence on Bush death plot claims
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US INVESTIGATORS are seeking more evidence on whether Iraq was behind a plot
to assassinate former President George Bush on a visit to Kuwait last month.
Mr George Stephanopoulos, the White House spokesman, said the US took the
allegations of Iraqi involvement very seriously. 'If we determine Iraq was
involved in state-sponsored terrorism, the US will take appropriate action
against Iraq,' he said.
It is unclear how the US could take tougher action against Iraq without
resorting to military measures. There may, however, be a political danger in
being seen to apply a double standard by dealing more harshly with Iraq than
with Serbia.
Eleven Iraqis and five Kuwaiti residents of Iraqi origin have been charged
in Kuwait with conspiracy to kill Mr Bush and with other acts of terrorism.
Iraq ridiculed the US and Kuwaiti charges. 'The sheikhs of Kuwait in
co-ordination with American intelligence are plotting another deception to
fool American public opinion in order to justify a new aggression on Iraq
and tighten the economic siege imposed on it,' Mr Hamed Youssef al-Hummadi,
Iraq's information minister, said.
Reuter reports from Kuwait: Kuwait's parliament has formed a sub-committee
to investigate allegations that Defence Ministry officials made money from
defence deals which have been concluded since the 1991 Gulf war, a member of
the assembly said yesterday.
Mr Mubarak al-Dawilah said he had submitted documents supporting the charges
to the sub-committee.
The incidents of corruption, alleged to have taken place since the emirate's
1991 liberation, include charges that a French company paid kickbacks worth
millions of dollars to a defence official to obtain a defence contract, Mr
Dawilah said.
Sheikh Ali Sabah al-Salem al-Sabah, the defence minister, has denied the
charges of corruption and mismanagement.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Assessing the case for higher government savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST World Economic Outlook from the International Monetary Fund (1)
forecasts a return to synchronised growth among the industrial countries by
1994. Like most mainstream forecasters, the IMF has been profoundly wrong
about the slowdown of recent years. If it is right at last, however, what
obstacles might emerge to a sustained recovery? Since inflation is now low
by recent historical standards, the IMF focuses particular attention on
'unsustainably large fiscal imbalances' and 'structural impediments to
saving and investment'.
The aggregate general government financial deficit of the G7 has grown from
1.2 per cent of GDP in 1989 to an expected level of 4.2 per cent in 1993. A
particularly startling deterioration has occurred in the UK, which saw a
surplus of 0.9 per cent in 1989 turn into a forecast deficit of 8.8 per cent
in 1993. The government deserved the Newbury by-election result for this
performance alone. But the French fiscal position has deteriorated
considerably too, as Edouard Balladur, the new French prime minister, will
be explaining this week.
Recession is only part of the explanation for the deterioration. 'In 1993,'
argues the IMF, 'the structural deficits of Germany, France, Canada, the US
and the UK are all estimated to be in the range of 2 to 5 per cent of GDP,
and that of Italy considerably higher.' Only Italy and Canada managed
noteworthy improvements in their structural fiscal deficits between 1991 and
1993, while the deterioration in the UK was over 4 per cent of GDP.
'The persistent failure to achieve an adequate degree of fiscal
consolidation', complains the IMF, 'has had costly macroeconomic
consequences: a lower level of potential output because of reduced capital
formation; lower productivity growth; high debt-GDP ratios and debt-service
payments; pressure on real long-term interest rates; and, most recently, low
consumer and business confidence because of uncertainties about future
economic policies.'
Fiscal positions do matter, but in what it says about the effect of
governments on national savings, the IMF goes too far. This is particularly
true of its argument that 'the most important reason for the trend decline
in national saving has been the general increase in budgetary imbalances'.
As the chart shows, however, the most important reason for this decline has
been the declining rate of private savings. The principal question would
seem to be how far governments should offset the behaviour of the private
sector, be it to raise the overall level of national savings, or to smooth
cyclical fluctuations in savings, or to equalise savings rates across
countries.
Governments of the G7 do seem to be evening out cyclical swings by saving
less whenever the private sector is saving more and vice versa. But they
have not offset the declining trend in the private savings rate.
Furthermore, public savings have not been relatively high where private
savings rates have been relatively low and low where private savings rates
have been high.
The World Bank's latest analysis of global economic prospects shows, for
example, that in 1991 the share of private savings in GDP was 17 per cent in
the US, while it was 24.9 per cent in Japan, and while public savings were -
2.2 and 9.3 per cent of GDP, respectively (2).
Government savings rates should take account of the rate of national savings
if the social return to savings exceeds the private return. Tax systems
alone ensure this. A still stronger case can be made for governments to keep
their fiscal deficits in bounds, since there is a limit to the indebtedness
that any government can hope to accumulate.
But the IMF overstates the link between the two issues. If declining levels
of national savings are a problem for the G7, the private sector, not the
government, has been the principal culprit. It is incentives for private
savings that should be examined more closely.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Gadaffi woos tourists and foreign investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
LIBYA'S leader, Colonel Muammar Gadaffi, has suggested that Libya should
encourage mass tourism to the country, where it is now banned, make the
Libyan dinar convertible and attract new foreign investment.
The suggestions, made in a televised weekend speech, are unlikely to be
translated immediately into practical steps. But they represent further
advocacy by Col Gadaffi of moves to liberalise Libya's state-dominated
economy.
The remarks also appear to indicate the Libyan leader's concern over the
political isolation and harmful economic effects caused by United Nations
sanctions against Libya. These were imposed in April 1992 after Tripoli
refused to hand over for trial in the west two suspects in the 1988 bombing
of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland.
The UN last month renewed the sanctions, which include a flights embargo,
while the US threatened to tighten them, perhaps to include a ban on oil
sales.
During the speech Col Gadaffi said Libya should consider creating a law
providing guarantees for foreign capital investment.
Foreign companies should be invited to invest in tourism. 'Tourism produces
a very big income,' he said. 'Libya had a ban on tourism. However, Libya is
very, very rich in tourist attractions.'
He also said the country should 'put on the agenda' making the Libyan dinar
fully convertible, but warned that 'this could only be done when there was
adequate production, otherwise it would be catastrophic'.
These proposals follow Col Gadaffi's suggestion in February that the
government should reduce its role in Libya's economy and his criticism of
the way public finances were being handled. Late last year he also urged
accelerated privatisation of key parts of the economy.
The calls for economic liberalisation - which must be debated by the
People's Congress - come as UN sanctions appear to be biting hard.
The Libyan government complained last week that the sanctions had cost more
than 800 Libyan lives and billions of dollars in revenues. A statement said
691 people had died in road accidents on their way to airports in
neighbouring countries, while 150 died because of delays in medical care
created by the blockade.
The government said sanctions had cost Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.4bn) in lost
exports and in losses to the country's livestock caused by shortages of
imported vaccines. Libyan Arab Airlines, the state carrier, had also lost
hundreds of millions of dollars.
Arab attempts to broker a solution to the Lockerbie impasse continue, led by
Egypt, the Arab League and countries of the Arab Maghreb Union, but there
are no signs of a breakthrough.
Col Gadaffi has sought to align himself more closely with his Arab
neighbours, speaking recently of the threat posed by Islamic fundamentalism
to the region - a concern felt more acutely in Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt
than in Libya. Last week he said fundamentalists were 'heretics' who should
be 'killed and liquidated just like a dog, without trials'.

<TEXT>
ALGERIA is to change the laws which took a radical Islamic party to the
brink of power, and will hold a constitutional referendum this year, as two
key elements of a plan to return to democracy, according to Mr Ali Kafi, the
head of state, Reuter reports from Algiers.
Mr Kafi also pledged that a 'transition period' for a return to democracy
would be kept as short as possible and that Algeria would move in 'an
organised way towards a market economy'.
More talks would be held with political parties and groups before the
referendum.
He said: 'The whole of the laws organising the pluralist political system we
envisage putting in place will be corrected in the light of experience.'
Under the present law, just 15 Algerian adults can form a political party.
Parties, theoretically, already cannot be based on religion, language or
region, but the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was allowed to
register and made no effort to hide its aims - to make Algeria a

FT  10 MAY 93 / Whaling countries seek an end to ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
YESTERDAY was 'whale meat day' at the Kujira-ya restaurant in Shibuya,
central Tokyo. For Y100 (58p), customers could buy a lunch of the dark red,
fat-free meat that would normally cost them Y1,200 or more.
That offer is part of the Japanese government's campaign to remind its
people of their 'whaling tradition' as delegates gather for the 45th annual
meeting of the International Whaling Commission, opening today in Kyoto.
The meeting of the 39 member countries, the first in Japan for a quarter of
a century, promises to be one of the stormiest. It inherits the unresolved
dispute from last year's meeting in Glasgow, when Norway announced it would
start commercial whaling this spring, despite the IWC's 10-year moratorium.
As the meeting opens, some Norway's whaling boats are already at sea, more
than 100 miles inside the Arctic Circle, and plan to kill up to 800 whales
whether the IWC gives permission or not. Norway can claim it is not flouting
international law because it shrewdly launched an official objection when
the IWC ban began. But its stand has roused opposition to its application to
join the European Community, which has an anti-whaling policy.
This year Japan has said it too may return to the hunt: it wants to take
2,000 whales a year. It has joined Norway in lobbying for an end to the ban,
and has hinted that it could withdraw from the IWC if this week's meeting is
dominated 'by emotion and not by scientific evidence'.
The Japanese whale-eating tradition is not as firmly entrenched as the
government sometimes suggests - whale became a popular source of protein in
the harsh years immediately following the second world war, but it fell from
30 per cent of total meat consumption in 1965 to 1 per cent in 1985, and has
fallen further since Japan observed the ban.
The IWC ban, which both Japan and Norway observed from 1987, has not stopped
them hunting whales. Thanks to a clause permitting 'scientific whaling',
Japan has continued catching 240-330 a year, and Norway around 100 a year.
However after scientists remove the stomachs for analysis, the meat goes
straight to local restaurants.
However, opposition to commercial whaling is divided, a handicap to
effective lobbying. Some, including prominent international scientists,
appear to accept the principle of 'sustainable' hunting, but share the
concerns of the IWC's Scientific Committee that it is hard to estimate whale
numbers accurately, and that not enough is yet known about their habits to
set quotas safely.
Others are opposed to commercial whaling on the grounds that killing by
harpoon is cruel - Britain is firmly in this camp. Conservationist
countries, led by the French, are bringing their own proposal to Kyoto: the
creation of the world's largest 'whale sanctuary' around the Antarctic, to
include much of the Japanese whaling waters.
Neither the sanctuary nor the lifting of the ban appears yet to have enough
support to be carried at this week's meeting. But with a year to prepare for
this confrontation, neither side has come to Kyoto in a mood for compromise.

THE Japanese government was last night attempting to head off pressure to
withdraw police officers from peacekeeping duties in Cambodia after the
killing of an officer in an ambush last week, writes Charles Leadbeater in
Tokyo.
Mr Keijiro Murata, home affairs minister, will today call for the unarmed
Japanese police officers to be given greater protection or be withdrawn to
Phnom Penh.
Mr Murata arrived in Phomn Phen yesterday for talks with the United Nations
Transitional Authority for Cambodia over the safety of Japanese personnel.
Untac has so far refused to accede to Japanese government demands to
withdraw the police to safer areas, on the grounds that this would be
preferential treatment.
The issue is highly sensitive for the Japanese government because the
despatch of peacekeepers to Cambodia was presented as a symbol of Japan's
commitment to play a wider role in UN affairs.
Japan has sent 600 military personnel and 75 police officers.

FT  10 MAY 93 / China likely to cool economy: The fears of a repeat of the
boom and bust cycle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SENIOR Chinese official chose his words carefully, avoiding expressions
such as credit curbs and import restrictions, but his meaning was clear:
China is, belatedly perhaps, seeking to cool its overheated economy.
'Although the credit situation in China is tolerable we shall try to
exercise greater control so as to avoid a repetition of the sort of the
situation that occurred in the late 1980s,' Mr Wang Zhongyu, director of the
newly established State Economic and Trade Commission, told reporters.
This was the most explicit public signal in recent months that the
authorities are intent on calming the economy, although fear of a return to
the 'boom and bust' cycle of the 1980s is encouraging caution.
Mr Wang complained of excessive duplication in some manufacturing
industries. China's economic boom was also placing an intolerable strain on
the country's infrastructure.
He also made it clear much stricter controls would be placed on fixed asset
investment to curb its astonishing growth of 70 per cent in the first
quarter of this year compared with the corresponding period last year.
'No country can give carte blanche to investment. Every country needs a
quota for its fixed asset investment. . . so we shall try to exercise more
effective control,' he said.
Western economists, who have long been arguing that China's spectacular
growth rates - 14 per cent for the first quarter on top of 13 per cent last
year - are unsustainable, believe that the main issue for the country's
economic managers is whether, in their efforts to 'fine tune' the economy,
they can avoid a 'hard landing'.
China's increasingly complex economy, in transition from rigid state control
to a market-oriented system, will not prove easy to calm without resort to
the tough administrative measures employed in the past. Yet these are the
very devices the authorities wish to avoid in this latest phase.
In the 1988 boom economic growth reached 12 per cent and urban inflation
exceeded 30 per cent, prompting a panicky administration to institute savage
credit curbs.
Mr Wang made it plain that a more rigorous approach would be applied to
granting credit, and priorities would be re-ordered. Preference would be
given to what he described as 'basic industries' such as transport and
energy in an effort to redress one of China's most critical problems.
Mr Wang, regarded as a reformist and thus close to Mr Zhu Rongji, senior
vice-premier and China's 'economic czar', said the economy was 'quite
healthy' but expressed concern about urban inflation, which reached 15.7 per
cent in the first quarter. He attributed the rise in retail prices both to
the lifting of controls on prices of some commodities such as grain, and
also to excessive demand due in part to the explosion in fixed asset
investment. Steel prices, for example, have gone through the roof.
State-owned enterprises are among the main culprits of the fixed asset
binge, and the most wasteful. The state sector recorded losses equivalent to
Dollars 76bn (Pounds 48bn) in 1992.
The Chinese official gave no indication that more strenuous efforts might be
made to restrain growth in the money supply which, according to the broader
M2 measure, charged ahead by 30.6 per cent last year and continued in
similar vein in the first quarter; but he did hint at possible interest rate
increases to cool activity.
Mr Wang gave no indication what steps, if any, might be envisaged to
stabilise China's exchange rate. The local currency is continuing to
depreciate.
The import surge, accompanied by a deterioration in China's trade balance,
spells further trouble for the yuan, which is now in sight of 10 to the US
dollar on the 'grey market' compared with an official rate of 5.7 and a
'swap market' rate of about 8.5.
China's official growth targets for this year, spelt out at the recent
National People's Congress, or parliament, are between 8 and 9 per cent.
However, with growth exceeding 14 per cent, a figure of 10 per cent seems
more likely, unless the authorities lose their nerve and decide a harder
landing is necessary.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Indian scandal blamed on lax bank management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RESERVE Bank of India, the country's central bank, in a final report on
last year's Rs40.2bn (Pounds 806m) securities market scandal blames lax bank
management for the affair.
Inadequate internal audits and inspections allowed irregular links to
develop between banks and stockbrokers in the securities market, says the
report, which was published in two parts at the weekend. Those responsible
for controlling business operations chose not to probe too deeply, says the
central bank.
The report says that while the Reserve Bank checked banks for asset quality
and bad debt provisions, it perhaps paid too little attention to the
activities of bank treasuries, the units primarily responsible for
securities market investments.
The scandal, which erupted in April last year, prompted the resignation of a
cabinet minister, the arrest of about 20 people, and big losses for some
banks, including Standard Chartered of the UK.
The latest Reserve Bank report mostly concerns facts already made public in
four previous reports and in evidence given to a parliamentary committee
which has separately been probing the affair. However, the report adds
several new names to the list of banks accused of carrying out irregular
transactions, including Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. The
report alleges that Hongkong Bank in its portfolio management services -
investment accounts which were used to invest funds in securities on behalf
of clients - infringed the rules under which such accounts were to be
operated.
The report makes recommendations on future regulation, saying tighter
supervision is needed in the interbank securities market, especially of
forward transactions and of the use of bankers' receipts, which are
instruments issued by banks representing securities which they hold. It also
recommends stricter supervision of brokers permitted to enter the interbank
market and higher standards of book-keeping, audit and inspection.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of Germany's battered opposition Social Democrats yesterday met
behind closed doors to discuss a successor to Mr Bjorn Engholm, the former
party chief whose abrupt resignation last week threw the party into
disarray.
The 13 members of the SPD presidium have swiftly to find a new party leader
and challenger to Chancellor Helmut Kohl to ensure the party's credibility
ahead of state and national elections next year.
The SPD is considering moving the annual party conference, due in autumn, to
June to cut the time the party leadership is left vacant. It is also
debating whether the next party chief will automatically become the rival
candidate to Mr Kohl.
Members of the presidium were meeting state party leaders last night.
Discussions are due to continue today within the executive board of the SPD.
Leading candidates for the post include Mr Gerhard Schroder, prime minister
of Lower Saxony, and Mr Rudolf Scharping, prime minister of the Rhineland
Palatinate. Ms Renate Schmidt, vice-president of the Bundestag, the lower
house of the German parliament and head of the SPD in Bavaria, also
announced she would run for the chancellor's office.
Opinion polls show popular support for the SPD is neck and neck with the
ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the
Christian Social Union (CSU).
While Mr Engholm's resignation has damaged the Social Democrats' standing in
public opinion, a series of scandals within the CDU/CSU has dealt equally
severe blows to the popularity of the ruling party.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Eurofighter fails to find its wings: The impact of cash
disputes and technical delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO THE embarrassment of all concerned, the Eurofighter is not yet airborne.
The prototype of the European Fighter Aircraft, re-baptised Eurofighter 2000
last year, should have flown in 1991, but crucial equipment and software is
still awaited.
Managers of the joint venture between Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain  -
which is now expected to cost Pounds 32bn - say the aircraft should fly at
Manching in Germany in September. But technical delays are not the only
problem.
German funding for development work has almost dried up. Five months after a
ministerial agreement in December to redefine the project and keep the
four-nation partnership, new contract terms are not settled.
It is also unclear how the partners will share production work. Eurofighter,
the consortium between British Aerospace, Daimler-Benz's Deutsche Aerospace
(Dasa) subsidiary, Alenia of Italy and Casa of Spain, is unable even to say
who will make the starboard wing.
The four governments have agreed, for budgetary reasons, to delay the target
date for the first Eurofighters entering service by two years, to 2000.
Germany and Spain do not want their aircraft before 2002. But officials say
the consortium could not have met the original schedule anyway.
At the end of last year the aircraft's electrical generator, supplied by a
joint venture between Ferranti International of the UK and the Bendix
division of Allied Signal of the US, failed its reliability tests. Fitting
an existing generator, heavier and underpowered for the fighter's needs,
delayed the first flight by five months.
This was less serious than software problems with the 'fly-by-wire' flight
control system. The aircraft relies on a computerised system to work its
flaps, rudder and the front winglets known as 'canards'. Dasa has overall
responsibility for the system but the software comes from GEC-Marconi of the
UK. A joint task force including more than 20 British engineers is in Munich
carrying out tests on the system.
The revised Eurofighter project was designed to allow nations to equip
aircraft according to their needs and budgets - the result of Bonn's
objection to the project's high price. But the 'menu' approach obscured the
question of overall costs. British government and industry officials argued
that since Germany followed unique accounting principles, which included
in-service costs, its figures could not be translated into sterling
estimates.
It is now clear that the price asked by the consortium in April 1992,
prompting the German crisis, was higher than expected. Reductions forecast
in the revised programme were against that price; they were expected to
range between 12 and 23 per cent.
Britain's saving was put at 14 per cent, through improved manufacturing
arrangements and economies in logistical support. But the extra cost in
sterling of German components, following the UK's withdrawal from the
exchange rate mechanism of the EMS, has reduced the expected saving to 11
per cent.
Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister, tried last year to kill the project
and have it replaced by a new, smaller aircraft. He failed, but had already
cut the funds allocated for Germany's share of the development programme
this year. The issue has still to be resolved.
Mr Hartmut Mehdorn, new president of Dasa's aircraft division, says the
company itself might provide the necessary finance. 'If there are some
short-term holes, we are ready to help out,' he said. But the company, which
has had to bail out some of its sub-contractors, would claim for the
financial charges, adding to programme costs and possibly heralding further
budget arguments.
The 'silly situation', as Mr Mehdorn calls it, over German funding has
clouded work on the revised project. In contrast to the high-profile
agreement in December, junior ministers from the four countries agreed on a
new programme at a meeting in Bonn on April 5. Under this, contracts for
setting up production will not be let until 1995, after the next general
election in Germany.
Britain consented to a slowing down of the programme only if it did not
raise overall costs. The engine consortium Eurojet - comprising Rolls-Royce,
Dasa's MTU offshoot, Fiat and ITP of Spain - is expected, however, to
receive an increase of up to 5 per cent on its fixed-price development
contract to cover a longer period of flight tests.
Eurofighter, responsible for the aircraft itself, is also seeking an
increase.
Government officials say that since Eurofighter is behind with its
programme, 'the cost consequences are theirs'.
Officials are anxious, however, to prevent a row emerging over
responsibilities. They expect new four-nation memoranda of understanding and
development contracts to be concluded in the third quarter, coinciding with
the first flight.
Germany's share of production work has yet to be resolved. Its 33 per cent
share in development was based on an expected purchase of 250 aircraft,
while the current forecast is 140. Mr Mehdorn says he expects Germany will
end up buying more aircraft and is seeking to maintain the same level of
participation.
The partners want to eliminate the more glaring inefficiencies resulting
from collaboration. For example, the radome which covers the radar on the
aircraft's nose takes 300 days to produce and spends more than 100 of them
moving from one country to another.
There is also an overlap between Britain and Spain on the starboard wing.
The other wing is Italian.
Administrative structures must also be rationalised. Eurofighter, Panavia
(an Anglo-German-Italian company overseeing the Tornado project) and two
intergovernmental management agencies work side by side in a Munich
building. But rivalry makes a merger unlikely for another two years.

LESS THAN two weeks ahead of a second referendum on closer European union,
Danish support for the Maastricht treaty has dropped to less than 50 per
cent, according to a survey published yesterday, AP reports from Copenhagen.
The Gallup Institute said 46 per cent of voters polled backed the treaty,
down from 51 per cent a week ago. The number of opponents swelled to 34 per
cent from 30 per cent during the same period.
The trend is in spite of the treaty exemptions granted to Denmark. These
include staying out of a common currency and joint defence policy.
The referendum is scheduled for May 18.

FT  10 MAY 93 / IG Metall is confident of fresh support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IG METALL, Germany's powerful engineering union, is confident it will
receive support for further strike action when it holds fresh ballots in
three of the remaining eastern states today.
The ballots, which coincide with a second week of strikes, the first in
eastern Germany for more than six decades, will be held in the metal and
engineering sectors in Berlin-Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. They
will conclude the union's balloting of its 400,000 members in eastern
Germany.
The strike, and the additional ballots, are primarily aimed at putting
pressure on Gesamtmetall, the metal and engineering employers' association,
and Arbeitgeberverband Stahl, the steel employers' grouping, to reinstate a
contract signed between the employers and the union in March 1991 designed
to equalise west and east German wages by next year.
Employers cancelled the contract because of deteriorating economic
conditions throughout Germany. East German wages are about 60 per cent of
those in the west, and productivity is lagging by as much as 70 per cent.
The strike is also to remind employers that IG Metall still has political
clout - even though the stoppage, organised by west Germans rather than east
Germans, could lead to higher unemployment in the east and sap union
membership further. The unemployment rate, taking into account job creation
schemes and short-time work, is about 30 per cent.
So far both sides, publicly at least, have hardened their positions. IG
Metall is insisting it will not return to the negotiating table until
employers reinstate the contract, while Mr Dieter Kirchner, head of
Gesamtmetall, yesterday said the timetable towards income parity must be
discarded.
However, both sides are willing to negotiate away from the limelight, in
Dresden, capital of Saxony. Talks which broke down last week are due to
resume early this week, and may break the deadlock. If not, a number of
foreign companies could consider shifting their suppliers from east to west
Germany, following a warning last week.
By yesterday, IG Metall had already called out 38,000 workers from 70
plants. More enterprises, located in Saxony, part of eastern Germany's
industrial heartland, and Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, the poorest of the
five states, will be affected today.

FT  10 MAY 93 / The European Market: Single market for TV still far off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the European consumer electronics industry, the single market is taking
time to arrive, write Alan Cane and Michiyo Nakamoto.
Mr Gerard Nauwelaerts, secretary general of the European Association of
Consumer Electronics Manufacturers, sums up the gap between aspiration and
reality. The single market, he says, 'has not happened because the consensus
and co-operation process is still much too slow, and the consultation system
is very costly'.
Does Europe need a Community-wide communications agency to set and promote
electronics standards along the lines of the US Federal Communications
Commission? In an ideal world, the answer would be yes.
Europe, however, already has a number of standards-setting bodies in the
forms of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (Etsi), the
Comite Europeen de Normalisation (Cen) and the Comite Europeen de
Normalisation Electrotechnique (Cenelec).
It could prove difficult to merge them into one organisation. And as Mr Hugh
Peltor, director of Brema, the UK consumer electronics trade association,
says: 'We should try to make our existing organisations work.'
Mr Peltor says Europe's telecommunications ministers, who meet today in
Brussels, should be able to carry out the job of a European-style FCC. The
saga of high definition television (HDTV) in Europe, however, illustrates
the difficulties of putting this idea into practice.
Television is the most important element in European consumer electronics.
But unless Europe can settle a strategy for HDTV - which will give
cinema-like clarity and quality - it could fail to reap the full benefits of
a harmonised market.
The structure of the present EC market for conventional TVs and VCRs (video
cassette recorders) highlights the problem. It is a largely disparate
collection of national markets, employing differing transmission standards
and specification requirements, with widely varying patterns of distribution
and purchasing.
European consumers have not benefited from the cross-border price
competition the single market was designed to bring about. As a result, they
are at a disadvantage compared with people in the US. Prices diverge widely
from country to country and in some markets touch on the exorbitant.
'You may never be able to talk of Europe as a single market as far as TVs
go,' says Ms Iris Merker, consumer electronics representative for Philips,
the Dutch manufacturer which has the largest share of the European market.
The diversity of standards is a headache for local manufacturers. There are
two main television standards in Europe, PAL and SECAM. But a plethora of
variations makes it necessary for manufacturers to produce several different
versions of each model.
Philips says it currently makes over 400 versions of several different
models of televisions to meet the different standards and requirements for
each EC country.
For example, it produces 90 different types of a particular high-end model
with stereo sound to meet different requirements in EC markets.
In addition, safety and environmental regulations and bureaucratic paperwork
differ from country to country.
The result is that manufacturers of TVs and VCRs must operate several
different production lines and employ specialist staff able to handle legal
and social matters for different countries.
The manufacturers hoped Europe's HDTV programme would offer a way through
the EC standards morass. The Community's failure to agree Ecu500m (Pounds
395m) of HDTV funding dented this optimism, however, and ministers now have
to recognise that the plan to harmonise standards is still a very long way
from bearing fruit.

FT  10 MAY 93 / EC telecoms ministers to press UK on HDTV
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EC telecommunications ministers will today get their best and possibly their
last chance to persuade Britain to agree a strategy for the development of
wide-screen, high-quality television in Europe.
Denmark, which holds the EC presidency, has indicated it will do its utmost
to get unanimous agreement on plans to promote European high-definition
television (HDTV) at today's meeting in Brussels.
But the UK, which has blocked all previous compromises over the last 18
months, is still reluctant to commit itself to new Danish proposals, even
though they go further than ever towards meeting British demands.
In particular, British officials say that Mr Edward Leigh, the hardline UK
telecoms minister, will not discuss funding for a new strategy until the
substance has been agreed.
'If the Danes begin with a discussion on money, it will be a very short
meeting,' warned one official on Friday.
If the UK continues to veto a deal then other member states may finally have
to abandon their ambitions for development of European HDTV, based on a
central action plan and EC funding for broadcasters and programme-makers.
That would cause a political storm because of the amount of time and public
money which has already been ploughed into advanced television equipment and
programmes in anticipation of continuing EC support.
Mr Michel Carpentier, head of the European Commission's telecommunications
directorate for the past 10 years and a firm advocate of HDTV, warned last
week that today's meeting was 'all or nothing.'
But in practice, the political stakes are so high that if there is any
progress today, Denmark may allow negotiations to continue at an extra
meeting of telecoms ministers on June 16.
The Danish compromise tries to answer British objections by suggesting that
companies seeking Community backing would have to meet at least half the
cost of promoting advanced television themselves.
Funding for a five-year plan, originally set at Ecu850m (Pounds 671m) by the
Commission, would be substantially reduced, although advocates of HDTV are
unlikely to settle for less than Ecu200m over five years.
The Danes are focusing on the development of a wide-screen format, not tied
to particular standards, and invite the Commission to come up with new
proposals to accelerate the development of digital HDTV standards, which
Britain argues will soon supersede the original EC norms.

   AGRIGENTO, SICILY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POPE John Paul II strongly condemned Mafia bosses yesterday, saying they
face the wrath of God unless they forsake their evil ways, AP reports from
Agrigento, Sicily.
'God once said, 'Don't kill.' Man, any man, any group of men, the Mafia,
can't change and trample this most sacred law of God,' the pope said in a
voice shaking with rage.
The outburst at the end of his visit to this Mafia bastion was the Catholic
Church's strongest condemnation of organised crime. The criticism, whose
vehemence stunned observers, came in impromptu remarks at an outdoor Mass in
the Valley of Temples, beneath a hilltop cluster of 5th century BC temples,
Earlier thousands heard the Pope pay homage to law officers who have tried
to clamp down on the Mafia.
'During this latest visit in Sicily, I can't help but recall, with
particular emotion, those who, in affirming the ideals of justice and law,
paid for their commitment to the struggle against the violent forces of evil
with the sacrifice of their lives,' he told a crowd outside Agrigento's
cathedral.
Several hours later, the Pope met the parents of Judge Rosario Livatino, who
was killed outside Agrigento in 1990. The Mafia allegedly ordered the
judge's death after he refused to let the Mafia sway him in issuing a
sentence.
The murders of Mafia investigators Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino has
also fuelled anger against the Mafia across the island. 'They are martyrs of
justice, indirectly of the faith,' the pope said.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Segni announces a new political party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Mario Segni, the leader of Italy's referendum movement, threw the
country's party political framework into disarray at the weekend after
announcing the creation of a new party to contest general elections expected
later this year.
Mr Segni left the Christian Democrats earlier this year in protest at their
inability to reform and distance themselves from members facing allegations
of political corruption and links with organised crime.
Since then, Alleanza Democratica (Democratic Alliance), the loose political
grouping formed around Mr Segni earlier this year, has coalesced amid signs
it could present a serious threat to the Christian Democrats, and possibly
other centre-right parties, at the polls.
Mr Segni's move came a day after Mr Giuliano Amato, former Socialist prime
minister, indicated he was also interested in promoting political change.
In an interview with La Stampa, the Turin newspaper, Mr Amato suggested the
creation of a new centre-left group which could embrace former Socialists
and members of other centre parties.
The signs that Mr Amato had reconsidered his decision to leave politics
after 10 months as Italy's prime minister were welcomed by a number of
politicians.
Mr Amato, believed to have turned down the Foreign Ministry in the new
government of Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, was widely praised for
steering the the country through one of the most difficult post-war periods.
Mr Segni's and Mr Amato's statements triggered immediate reactions from the
Christian Democrat and the Socialist leaderships. Mr Mino Martinazzoli,
Christian Democrat leader, poured scorn on the Democratic Alliance, while
expressing hopes that Mr Segni might return to the fold.
The new alliance was no more than 'a cylinder into which everyone wants to
put something', said Mr Martinazzoli. 'I don't agree with Segni when he says
that innovation means getting rid of the Christian Democrats.'
Separately, Mr Giorgio Benvenuto, Socialist leader, made clear his readiness
to offer Mr Amato a senior party position. The Socialists have been rocked
by the departure of a number of senior figures recently in protest at the
support of many MPs for Mr Bettino Craxi, their former leader.
Meanwhile, the Lega Nord, the regional autonomist grouping headed by Mr
Umberto Bossi, confirmed it would change its name in an attempt to broaden
its electoral base and shake off its lingering racist image.
The party will call itself the 'Italian Federal League' in central and
southern Italy while retaining its 'Lega Nord' title in the north.
The simmering divisions within the Christian Democrats and Socialists have
been exacerbated in the run-up to important local polls on June 6, which
will be the biggest test of political support since last year's general
elections.
Attention has focused in particular on Milan and a few other big cities,
where a new law on the direct election of mayors will be put to the test.
The mayoral race in Milan, a former Socialist stronghold, has attracted 12
candidates. However, in a measure of the demise of a party whose word once
held sway in the city, Mr Piero Borghini, Milan's former mayor, made clear
at the weekend his preference not to have formal support from the Socialists
for his candidature.
Mr Borghini, mayor until the city council collapsed earlier this year, was a
Communist party member before being appointed mayor as an independent with
Socialist backing. Milan has been run by a senior civil servant from the
Interior Ministry, pending new elections, after local politicians failed to
agree on a new city council.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Demirel fails in first ballot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY'S parliament failed at the weekend to elect a new president in the
first ballot when Mr Suleyman Demirel, the front-runner, did not win the
two-thirds majority required, our foreign staff and Reuter report.
Prime Minister Demirel, tipped as the most likely candidate to replace Mr
Turgut Ozal, who died of heart failure last month, received 234 votes from
the 450-member single-chamber Grand National Assembly.
A second ballot will be held on Wednesday, at which the winner also needs a
two-third majority, and if necessary a third on May 16, when only a simple
majority is required. Seven times prime minister and twice ousted by the
military, the 69-year-old Mr Demirel has been a feature of the Turkish
political map for almost three decades.
There is some disappointment that he is keen to take up a largely ceremonial
post, leaving the government without strong leadership.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Tired Belgrade stands behind Milosevic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNDER threats of military intervention and worried about plunging standards
of living, people in Belgrade appear to have accepted the apparent
abandonment by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic of his Bosnian kin.
Nearly 70 per cent of the population supports the Vance-Owen plan, more than
double the figures of last month, an opinion poll shows.
Most inhabitants of the Serbian and federal capital also seem to welcome Mr
Milosevic's move to cut off all supplies, except food and medicine, to
Bosnia after the dismissal by Bosnian Serb leaders of Belgrade's appeals to
back an international peace plan.
'The most important thing is peace. Milosevic should support any plan which
creates the conditions for peace,' says Nada, a 50-year-old school-teacher,
reciting almost verbatim the daily fare of state-controlled Belgrade
Television.
'Belgrade Television now says that everyone supports the plan. Last week we
were all supposedly against it,' says Sasa, a computer programmer, worried
about whether he could afford another half kilo of potatoes at Kalenic
vegetable market.
Most people appear confused by Mr Milosevic's sudden policy shift but
support his calls for peace. Worn down by uncertainty and increasing
economic deprivation, they want to believe the war is over.
However, many do not believe that the terms of peace will exclude eventual
unification of the Serb territories.
This message, that what has been gained in the war can be cemented in peace,
has been the main pillar of Mr Milosevic's new campaign. Last week he and
other Belgrade power brokers tried to persuade Mr Radovan Karadzic, the
Bosnian Serb leader, to back the plan, on the grounds that their forces have
accomplished most of their goals.
They appear confident the plan will fail to restore a multi-ethnic Bosnian
state. 'If Yugoslavia could not survive I think it will be impossible to
rebuild a multi-ethnic Bosnia,' says Sasa.
The UN imposed tough new sanctions on Yugoslavia, now comprising Serbia and
Montenegro, after the Bosnia Serb assembly rejected the peace plan to divide
Bosnia into 10 provinces along ethnic lines.
'They should have signed the peace plan. Karadzic does not have the right to
force Serbia and Montenegro to make sacrifices,' says Toma, a peasant who
fled Bosnian Croat troops in Mostar, western Bosnia.
The Serb referendum next weekend on the Bosnia peace plan will also ask
whether the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb republic should be able to unite
with other Serbian regions, the speaker of the Bosnian Serb parliament, Mr
Momcilo Krajisnik, announced yesterday, Reuter reports.

FT  10 MAY 93 / US irritation grows over Europe's Bosnian stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a week of intensive discussions between Mr Warren Christopher, US
secretary of state, and European governments, the Clinton administration
appears to be little nearer a decision on what to do in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
On Friday, after meeting leaders of the European Community in Washington,
President Bill Clinton was at pains to argue that there remained no more
than 'some disagreement around the edges' between the US and Europe over the
conflict.
But some administration officials appear frustrated by what they see as a
willingness in European capitals to delay taking action against Bosnian
Serbs. This is coupled with irritation at Europe's perceived ambivalence
over US leadership: European governments want Mr Clinton to take the lead,
but they do not like the direction he wants to lead them in.
Senator Richard Lugar, the senior Republican on the Senate foreign relations
committee, said: 'They may prefer that Serbia simply finishes the war, end
the war out there, and that it not be extended by rearming the Bosnians. I
think we have a different view and our view, I believe, must prevail.'
Ambivalence, however, is just as widespread in Washington as in London or
Paris. Congress is deeply split over the issue and a long way from embracing
even limited US military involvement, such as air strikes, while opinion is
divided within the administration. 'It appears to me the president is as
confused as we are,' said Senator Howard Metzenbaum, a Democrat from Ohio.
Although Mr Clinton appears determined to act, he shows signs of annoyance
that Bosnia is distracting him from his promise to 'focus on the economy
like a laser beam'. He would evidently prefer some swift and limited action
that would permit him to return his attention to domestic issues.
Mr Clinton said on Friday that if he were to ask for congressional approval
for the use of air power in Bosnia, he would lay out 'very clear tactical
objectives' which would have 'a beginning, a middle and an end'.
Beyond the general promise that the US will not be sucked into an endless
engagement, as it was in Vietnam, Washington takes this to mean a short US
air campaign intended to freeze the conflict until Bosnian Moslems can be
given heavy weapons to defend themselves.
The use of US ground troops remains, however, ruled out - although there is
some lingering embarrassment in Washington that this refusal is hard to
justify if Serbian actions do, in fact, represent a genocide comparable to
that of Nazi Germany.
While some members of Congress are now beginning to consider troop
deployments, although they are still heavily outnumbered, popular opinion
remains strongly opposed not only to the use of ground troops but also to
air strikes.

<TEXT>
AFTER months of trying to strong-arm Ukraine into surrendering its nuclear
missiles, the US appears to be taking a softer line, writes Chrystia
Freeland in Kiev. The new approach will be unveiled today when Mr Strobe
Talbott, Washington's ambassador at large to the former Soviet Union, holds
a series of meetings with senior Ukrainian officials and MPs.
He will not, however, be meeting either Ukraine's president or its prime
minister, a sign of the current coolness in relations with the US.
Mr Talbott said he would like to shift the US-Ukrainian relationship from
its focus on nuclear weapons to a wider range of issues.
'It is important not to be a one-note Johnny. What we want to do is engage
the Ukrainian government in a dialogue about the relationship in all of its
aspects, rather than just dwelling on one subject, important as that subject
may be.'
Mr Talbott also emphasized that the US 'wants to develop a relationship with
Ukraine in its own right,' separate from that with Russia.
US relations have deteriorated over the past few months as Washington
pressed Kiev to fulfil its earlier pledge to become a non-nuclear state.

FAR-REACHING proposals to accelerate the political and economic integration
of six former communist countries into the EC are to receive a first hearing
among EC foreign ministers today, writes Lionel Barber in Brussels.
The meeting in Brussels is likely to show whether the European Commission's
plans for improved, across-the-board access for east European products can
win endorsement at next month's EC summit in Copenhagen. Proposals for freer
trade with Russia are also on the agenda.
The UK, Germany and Denmark are fully behind the Commission's bolder than
expected approach toward the east Europeans, but Spain and Portugal are
calling for prudence.
Today's meeting is also expected to include calls for recalcitrant EC member
states to ratify the Europe Agreements offering trade liberalisation to
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria.
The agreements have been in effect for more than a year for Poland and
Hungary, but have been ratified only by the UK, Ireland, Denmark, Luxembourg
and Spain. Free-trading Germany has delayed; it is expected to ratify along
with the Netherlands, Greece and Italy by August. France has legal problems,
Portugal has translation difficulties, and Belgium has 'internal procedural
problems'.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Old guard gathers to praise God and Stalin: Celebrations
marking the Soviet defeat of Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEMONSTRATION by 30,000-40,000 nationalists and communists in central
Moscow yesterday was anti-climactically peaceful compared with the May Day
gathering of 5,000 in Gagarin Square, where one person was killed and some
500 injured.
Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Terekhov, leader of the Union of Officers, had
agreed with the Moscow City council that the march on the anniversary of the
defeat of Nazi Germany would be peaceful, and it was. It was even moving, as
old soldiers, medals tinkling, stepped down the broad streets while
patriotic hymns belted out.
Symbols which have been at conflict for decades were much in evidence.
Orthodox crosses, Russian imperial flags and the hammer and sickle all vied
for attention. On the front of the rocket transporter carrying some of the
main representatives in the parade were two portraits of Stalin and, on the
side, an icon of the Virgin.
In Triumfalnaya Square, Col Terekhov introduced a bevy of speakers, whose
normal garrulity he strictly controlled. The nationalists and communists
pose no great threat to President Boris Yeltsin, but yesterday they
delivered a string of nationalist-Stalinist obsequies to the Soviet Union,
to God and to the victory won under Stalin.
Mr Sergei Baburin, Mephistophelean leader of Russian Unity, said: 'Yes, the
French (Yeltsin have again occupied the Kremlin but they will soon be on the
road to Smolensk.'
General Albert Makashov, the Stalinist who challenged Mr Yeltsin for the
presidency two years ago, claimed Russia was a holy land. He ended his
speech by seizing an old priest who was blessing everyone, kissing him three
times on the cheeks - to his obvious surprise - and shouting 'Hurrah'.
In two incidents the anti-semitism displayed on many of the signs was
brought to life. In one, two elderly men commented with approval on placards
calling for the 'cleansing' of Jews from the media. A woman in her 70s, a
row of medals on her chest, turned and said loudly: 'We don't need this. We
were all together at the front - Russians Jews, Georgians, Ukrainians. It's
true some Jews shout too much now but they fought fascism.' The old men said
no more.
The second was nastier. In Red Square - to which the demonstration
ultimately marched - a beggar was kneeling on the cobbles, his hand out. In
front of him half a dozen western photographers were snapping the image of
impoverished contemporary Russia, and giving him more money than he would
normally clear in a month.
Some communists, seeing this, came over and began nudging the beggar with
their feet and chasing away the photographers. One man, seeing me taking
notes, came over and yelled: 'Make sure you write that all the Jews should
end up in Babi Yar' - site of the mass grave in Kiev where a large number of
the city's Jews were thrown afer being shot in 1942.
A former officer came up, expressed disapproval of his comrade and said:
'That's not necessary. We were together in the war.' And now? 'Now things
are pretty rough. But still, we have a lot of nationalities here who lived
well together in the Soviet days.'
Those bearing the pictures of Stalin and the Jew-baiting banners bobbing
about in Red Square looked for a call to arms and, hearing none, dispersed
into groups of passionate argument.
Before the Bolshoi Theatre across the way Mrs Anna Lichinski held a picture
of a young man; the wording below it said that this was her father,
Vladimir, missing from the front from November 1942. 'If anyone has
information, please address themselves to his daughter.'
She had been coming here, she said, for 40 years.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Bosnia ceasefire eases pressure for intervention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER, LIONEL BARBER and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE, BRUSSELS, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FRESH ceasefire between Serb and Moslem-led forces came into force
yesterday throughout Bosnia, easing pressure for early western military
intervention.
Calls for western action had become more persistent in the aftermath of the
rejection by Bosnian Serb leaders of an international peace plan.
The ceasefire appeared largely to hold for the first few hours. Bosnian
president Alija Izetbegovic alluded to sniping and some shelling in the
capital, Sarajevo, and what he said was sporadic shooting elsewhere.
But General Philippe Morillon, commander of United Nations forces in the
former Yugoslav republic, said the ceasefire needed time to work.
Fierce fighting erupted between Moslem forces and their former Croat allies,
who were not involved in the weekend ceasefire deal, in several towns in
central Bosnia, blocking a key route for humanitarian aid.
UN spokesman Mr Jose Gallegos said Bosnian Croats attacked Bosnian
government forces in Mostar, about 70km southwest of Sarajevo, early
yesterday. The fighting among the supposed allies was so intense that the UN
Spanish battalion based in Mostar was forced to pull back to surrounding
hillsides.
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Sarajevo said several apartment
buildings in Mostar had been cleared of all Moslem inhabitants and it had
reports that Croatian forces were planning to deport the Moslems to Zenica
and Jablanica.
There were also reports from UN observers of house-to-house fighting in the
old Moslem quarter of the city, in which big fires broke out. Moslems were
ordered to hang white flags on their homes and put weapons out on the
street. UNHCR staff and UN military observers were barred from the city.
Ten buses containing about 400 people, including women and children, guarded
by Croatian soldiers, were seen leaving Mostar.
UN monitors, however, who arrived in Zepa - an enclave in eastern Bosnia
where 30,000 Moslems are believed to be trapped by Serbs and which the
Security Council has declared a 'safe area' - reported no fighting.
The ceasefire was signed by Bosnian Serb army general Ratko Mladic and
Moslem commander Sefer Halilovic at Sarajevo airport on Saturday. It
declares the besieged strongholds of Zepa and Srebrenica 'demilitarised
zones' which will be policed by UN monitors. It also calls for the
withdrawal of weapons and combatants from the enclaves.
Lord Owen, the European Community mediator, said yesterday that the latest
truce may have averted the possibility of rash military intervention against
Serb military targets in Bosnia.
Previous ceasefires since the war erupted 13 months ago have collapsed
almost immediately.
EC foreign ministers are expected today to use the ceasefire as an argument
for resisting US pressure for military action against the Bosnian Serbs.
Despite signs of a more robust attitude among German, Belgian and Italian
delegations, majority sentiment led by France and the UK is leaning towards
a 'wait and see' approach.
In particular, the EC ministers meeting in Brussels want to see if the
ceasefire will hold in the light of Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic's
decision to cut off all but humanitarian supplies to the Bosnian Serbs.
In Washington on Saturday President Bill Clinton met foreign policy and
defence advisers to hear Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, report
on his trip to Europe last week for discussions with allies on what action
to take in Bosnia.
Air strikes or other military action appear to be, at the very least,
several days off. Although US officials are dismissive of the usefulness of
the referendum that Bosnian Serbs have vowed to hold over the Vance-Owen
peace plan, they acknowledge that it has helped slow the movement towards
military action.
US officials appear to agree that Mr Clinton will not and should not move
without first gauging support from Congress, as well as from public opinion.
Several senior congressmen said yesterday there are not, at the moment,
enough votes in Congress to support military action.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Tecs and government split over training for jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARP DIFFERENCES in priorities for training the jobless have emerged
between the government and the private-sector-led bodies it pays Pounds
1.8bn a year to carry out the programmes, according to a survey by the
Financial Times.
The survey is the second to canvass the opinions of the 1,220 board members
of the 82 Training and Enterprise Councils in England and Wales which are
now responsible for delivering the government's main training programmes.
Most of the Tec directors who responded rated the training of the jobless as
their lowest priority, although most public funding they receive is for that
purpose.
Top priority, according to a majority of the directors, mostly senior
business men and women, was local economic regeneration, including the
creation of jobs so that proper opportunities could exist for the
unemployed. One director said: 'Jobs should be real and not cosmetic.'
The survey highlights the frustration of many Tec directors who want more
discretion in assessing local economic and labour market needs as the
recession ends.
Fifty-nine per cent of directors in the survey were not satisfied with the
way Tecs collectively communicate with the government.
The findings are topical. While the government sees Tecs as here to stay,
there are growing tensions in Whitehall itself over how the partnerships
should evolve.
Tecs themselves want more co-ordination between government departments so
that a more focused approach could be taken to areas such as education and
training. Half the 506 directors who responded to the survey - more than 40
per cent of all the Tec directors in England and Wales - advocated the
establishment of a new department of education and training.
Directors gave broad general approval to many of the innovative ideas on
tackling unemployment being piloted by the Department of Employment, such as
subsidising employers taking on long-term unemployed individuals. Concern
was expressed, however, over the potential for job substitution.
One of the most controversial ideas being considered by the government is
'workfare'. Selected groups would have to take up either community jobs or
training in return for benefits. Forty-six per cent of respondents in the
survey supported such a move.
Directors were also in favour of a credit, or entitlement, for people aged
16 to 19 to undertake either academic or vocational education. The survey
showed widespread concern about government economic policy.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Eurofighter costs increase 50% over original estimates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COST of Eurofighter, the ambitious pan-European defence project, has
jumped by more than 50 per cent from original estimates when development of
the four-nation aircraft was launched five years ago, according to
confidential official figures.
The programme is now expected to cost as much as Pounds 32bn (Dollars 49bn)
at today's prices. In 1988, the joint venture partners estimated it would
cost Pounds 21bn.
The increase can be attributed only partly to inflation, and arises even
though cuts in the programme were agreed last year. It reflects higher
production and development costs than estimated. The four partners -
Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain - are expected to buy about 600 aircraft
instead of the 765 originally planned.
The latest cost figure will provoke demands from opposition politicians in
the partner countries that governments provide a fuller explanation of
expenditure on the Eurofighter.
The total Pounds 32bn bill for the Eurofighter 2000 includes about Pounds
9bn for development, most of which has been spent or committed, and the cost
of setting up technical support for the initial period of service.
Project managers expect the first flight of the aircraft in September, two
years behind schedule. However, difficulties with the GEC-Marconi software
for its flight control system have still to be resolved.
British officials are now working to a planning figure of Pounds 13bn for
the UK's share of the project, involving 250 aircraft. That is almost twice
the Pounds 7bn figure cited for UK costs when Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then
prime minister, gave the go-ahead for the project in 1988.
The internal government estimate has risen by Pounds 1.5bn in the past year
in spite of an agreement between the partners in December to redefine
specifications and seek cost reductions.
The figure is significantly higher than public forecasts.
Mr David Clark, Labour Party defence spokesman, said at the weekend he was
'shocked' by the increase in projected cost and would table questions in
parliament. 'It behoves the government to be much more open and honest with
the general public as to the cost of defence,' he said.
Excluding logistic support, the bill works out at about Pounds 45m for each
RAF Eurofighter. That is roughly twice what it would have cost to buy the
latest version of the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18, which was rejected by the
four Eurofighter countries.
British Aerospace, the main UK partner, argues that the government could
recoup all its costs through revenue generated by exports of the aircraft.
The UK, which plans a better-equipped version than Germany, is the only
partner not to have reduced its purchase plans.
Under the revised programme, drawn up to enable Germany to stay in the
project, production has been delayed, with the first deliveries not due
until the year 2000.
The only contracts let so far are for development, at fixed inflation-linked
prices. They are being renegotiated to reflect changes in the programme.
Governments are resisting claims for extra funding by the consortium.

FT  10 MAY 93 / Senior Tories join reshuffle calls: Major urged by
colleagues to act to restore his authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLOSE associates of Mr John Major last night echoed the chorus of calls from
Conservative MPs for Mr Norman Lamont to be moved from the Treasury as the
disarray in the Tory party threatened to spill over into the cabinet.
Humiliating defeats last week in the Newbury by-election and in the shire
counties brought conflicting demands on the prime minister from cabinet
ministers on how the government should restore its political authority.
Some suggested that the prime minister must revamp his political agenda.
Others dismissed calls for a significant change of direction.
A procession of senior colleagues mounted an orchestrated public defence of
the chancellor, dismissing as 'absurd' the idea that he should be blamed for
election defeats. Mr Lamont's cabinet allies were also insisting in private
that he must not be made a 'scapegoat' for the resentment in the country
over the recession.
But some of the most influential figures in the government were arguing
strongly that Mr Major would not be able to restore his own political
authority until he reshuffled his cabinet and installed a new chancellor.
'We need a (cabinet) reconstruction, a fresh start,' one commented last
night.
As Mr Major prepared for a detailed post-mortem this morning on the causes
of the election defeats, the associates suggested that he could not afford
to delay such a reshuffle beyond the summer parliamentary recess.
Although senior colleagues were reluctant to blame Mr Lamont, it was clear
last night that those who believe he should stay on were in a minority in
the cabinet. There were also clear indications that soundings since last
Thursday have shown intense pressure among Tory party activists for a new
chancellor.
The debate over Mr Lamont's future was mirrored by signs of divisions within
the cabinet on how the government should respond to the electoral defeat,
threating further to undermine Mr Major's premiership.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, acknowledged on BBC radio that the
government was 'in a dreadful hole'. Mr Clarke, on the centre-left,
pro-European wing of the Conservative party, said the government needed to
get across 'our view of this country in Europe' and to set tackling crime as
a high priority. He regretted the 'parliamentary tangle' over Maastricht and
Britain's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism.
In contrast, Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury,
emphasised in a BBC television interview the priorities of the Tory right:
'Sound money, which means controlling inflation . . . sound public finances,
which means the government not living beyond its means; and controlling the
size of the state.' Mr Lamont, he said, had done an 'outstandingly good
job.'
A further test for Mr Major will come this afternoon when MPs debate the
extension of value added tax to domestic fuel - acknowledged yesterday by Mr
Portillo as a cause of Tory losses last Thursday.

TAP Air Portugal, the state owned airline, has announced 1992 losses of
about Esc50bn (Dollars 341m), five times bigger than it forecast, AP-DJ
reports from Lisbon.
TAP - one of several companies due for privatisation under the government's
economic reform plan - blamed declining air travel, a fares war, the closing
of domestic carrier Atlantis Airlines and high capital spending.
Mr Ferreira de Amaral, transport minister, has said that US and Japanese
companies have expressed interest in TAP, but the company declined to
comment on the identity of possible investors.
United Air Lines of the US is reported to be among those most interested.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Government seeks to recoup Pool Re claims
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT aims to recoup any claims it meets as reinsurer of last
resort to Pool Re, the reinsurance company set up by UK insurers to cover
against the risk of terrorist attack.
Pool Re will pay a premium for the reinsurance cover, with the premium
structure designed with the aim of 'avoiding any net cost to the government
over a period of years', according to the text of the bill before
parliament.
It is expected that Pool Re will be authorised to trade as an insurer next
week. It was created after the decision by UK insurers to exclude terrorism
cover from commercial insurance policies from January 1 1993.
It is likely that claims stemming from the Bishopsgate bomb last month will
exhaust premiums collected by the pool's managers to date, leaving the
government with much of the bill, estimated at Pounds 300m to Pounds 400m.
As a result of the losses Pool Re is likely to review its premium structure
over the next few weeks, leaving many insurance buyers, especially in areas
judged vulnerable to terrorist attack, with potentially heavy increases.

agreement

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US arm of Canadian property group Olympia &amp; York yesterday made a
pre-packaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing for its 55 Water Street office
tower in Manhattan, the world's largest privately-owned office building.
The filing follows an agreement between O&amp;Y and the holders of Dollars 525m
in 55 Water St bonds last autumn in which the huge office building was
handed over to the bondholders in exchange for the cancellation of the debt.
Under the reorganisation plan bondholders may accept 28 cents in the dollar
for their bonds or exchange them for common stock in the corporation that
will own 55 Water St. If they accept the cash, bondholders will receive a
total of Dollars 149m.
The Retirement Systems of Alabama, the Dollars 12bn state pension fund and
biggest bondholder, meanwhile, has agreed to buy any shares that are not
taken.
O&amp;Y said the filing would not affect its negotiations with creditors to
restructure the company's debt in the US.
The troubled property group was forced to relinquish ownership of 55 Water
St last year when it became clear that cash flow from the building was not
enough to pay the annual interest payments of Dollars 36m on the bonds.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE government was divided yesterday over whether to withdraw
personnel from a United Nations peacekeeping operation in Cambodia, as UN
officials alleged that Tokyo had recalled police officers to Phnom Penh
without UN permission.
Increased public criticism after the killing of a Japanese police officer
this week, and yesterday's dispute with the UN, have embarrassed Tokyo,
which sees the Cambodian operation as an important part of Japan's growing
international role.
A meeting of senior ministers yesterday agreed that the 600 military
personnel and 70 police should remain in Cambodia, but after the meeting Mr
Junichiro Koizumi, the posts and telecommunications minister, said Japan
should 'shed sweat but not blood'.
Mr Koizumi, influential in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, said the
government should review the safety of personnel and 'seriously consider'
withdrawing from Cambodia, where attacks by Khmer Rouge forces have
intensified in recent weeks.
Meanwhile, Japanese officials said there had been a 'misunderstanding' with
the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac), which
insisted that Japan had no authority to order its police officers back to
Phnom Penh from other parts of the country.
Untac officials said they were aware that some Japanese police officers were
returning to Phnom Penh, but they did not have formal permission from
commanders of the 3,500-strong international police force in Cambodia.
One UN official reportedly said some of the returning Japanese personnel
could be guilty of 'insubordination'. Six police officers have been
transferred to Bangkok, including two injured in the attack which killed a
policeman this week.

Argentina yesterday protested against Britain's decision to extend its
territorial waters around the disputed South Georgia and South Sandwich
island in the South Atlantic, Reuter reports from Buenos Aires.
Britain has extended to 200 miles its 12-mile (19km) territorial
jurisdiction in waters surrounding the islands, situated east of the
Falkland Islands, in order to counter over-fishing by third countries.

FT  08 MAY 93 / World News in Brief: General Motors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors of the US, the world's biggest vehicle maker, is to set up a
Dollars 100m (Pounds 64.90m) utility vehicle plant beginning in 1994. GM,
acting through its Brazilian subsidiary, will work with CIADEA, a local car
company, which will hold an undisclosed minority stake in the venture. GM
quit the country 15 years ago because of political unrest and economic
decline. Its return is seen as an indication of increasing international
confidence in Argentina's economic reforms.

Early deals saw the FT-SE 100 Index down 14 points but the UK equity market
closed with relative optimism, up 7.4 at 2,793.7. Share prices brushed off
the initially bearish effects of the government's poor showing in local
elections and turned higher as they moved into the new account.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets9): Copper prices driven to
fresh lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COPPER market was down in the dumps again this week as Chinese sellers
returned to batter prices to 5 1/2 -year lows. At the London Metal Exchange
the three months delivery contract closed yesterday at Pounds 1,128.75 a
tonne, down Pounds 80.75 on the week and Pounds 300 from the beginning of
April - and some dealers were talking of a further 20 per cent slide before
the present bear market has run its course.
'The market was too high for too long and now will probably go too low for
too long,' one trader told the Reuter news agency.
Mr Stephen Briggs, analyst at the Metals and Minerals Research Services
consultancy, explained that speculative activity and nervousness about
possible supply disruptions had until recently been keeping copper prices
high in defiance of the fundamentals. 'Copper producers have been making
lots of money when in their cyclical business they should have been losing
money,' he said.
The high prices have encouraged the commissioning of new capacity at a time
of slack demand, which has resulted in persistent overproduction. Stocks in
LME-registered warehouses this week reached 400,300 tonnes, compared with
280,000 tonnes 12 months ago and 210,000 in April 1991, which at the time
was regarded as far too high.
In yesterday's issue of its daily Commodity Report, GNI, the London trader,
suggested that combined LME and New York Commodity Exchange stocks, at
present just over 500,000 tonnes, could by the end of this year 'be
approaching 1m tonnes'. But it thought sellers might become more cautious in
the nearer term in view of the possibility of production disruption at
Chile's Chuquicamata mine, where wage negotiations are scheduled to begin
later this month. Meanwhile LME traders noted that there was concern over
production problems at the El Teniente mine, also in Chile, where recent
rain is expected to force a five-day closure.
The depression in the zinc market is of much longer standing and
unremunerative prices have prompted production cuts by several companies.
The trend was continued this week with the news that output was to be pared
further at Noranda of Canada and Falconbridge, its 50 per cent owned
associate. Having already decided in February on a cut in combined
production to 530,000 tonnes this year from last year's 573,000 tonnes, the
two companies announced on Wednesday that the figure had been reduced again
to 500,000 tonnes.
The news sparked a brief flurry in the market, but gains were quickly
eliminated as the cut was measured against LME stocks, which rose by more
than 20,000 tonnes in the past two weeks to 648,200 tonnes. A renewed rally
on Thursday, encouraged by news of a force majeure declaration because of a
labour dispute at Westmin Resources Myra Falls mine in British Columbia, was
snuffed out equally quickly and at last night's close three months zinc was
quoted at Dollars 1,027.50 a tonne, up just Dollars 2 on the week.
The prospect of work stoppages resulting from US labour negotiations
begining at the end of this month encouraged buyers in the aluminium market.
Sentiment was undermined by copper's weakness but, having absorbed bouts of
speculative selling, the market resumed its upward trend yesterday to close
at Dollars 1,151.50 a tonne for three months metal, up Dollars 14.25 on the
week.
At the London bullion market gold weathered an early wave of profit-taking
following last week's upsurge before moving on to break overhead resistance
at Dollars 356.50 on the way to a nine-month high of Dollars 357.80 a troy
ounce, up Dollars 2.05 on the week. But hopes of a move to Dollars 360 an
ounce appeared to be fading. 'There's been some buying around the Dollars
358 area and if it got through that, it would then hit key resistance at
Dollars 360,' one trader told Reuter. 'But I feel a retracement to around
Dollars 352/353 is more likely.'
Silver was fixed yesterday morning at a fresh 21-month high of 436.25 US
cents an ounce, but it slipped back to close unchanged on the week at 435.50
cents. 'Both gold and silver have made good recoveries but will need a boost
to surpass strong overhead resistance,' GNI suggested.
New York traders turned against coffee early in the week after hearing that
US certified stocks, which they had expected to show another fall, had risen
by about 15,000 bags (60 kg each). With stocks elsewhere also high and a
period of seasonally slack demand approaching sellers had the edge for the
remainder of the week, which ended with London's July robusta contract
Dollars 30 down on balance at Dollars 874 a tonne.
New York raw sugar futures also surrendered some of their recent gains with
the July position reaching 12.25 cents a lb in late trading yesterday, down
0.57 on the week.
Oil prices consolidated above Dollars 19 a barrel this week as sentiment was
aided by demand from US refineries for North Sea crude and a forecast by the
International Energy Agency, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development's oil monitoring body, of a rise in second quarter demand. It
expected the rise to amount to 500,000 barrels a day, or about 1.5 per cent,
compared with the same period last year. In addition the IEA estimated that
production by members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries
fell to 24.1m b/d last month from 24.4m b/d in March.

FT  08 MAY 93 / As They Say in Europe: Washington Post and water buffalogate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS a great relief to get back to the European papers after a week of the
Washington Post.
On the east side of the Atlantic one finds awful drivel,
lowest-common-denominator lubricity; bitter, partisan distortions, cheap
abuse and fanatical commitment to pointless causes. US columnists try to
scale some of these heights but end up merely driving hobby horses into the
ground. Where Europe scores is in the lack of the mealy-mouthed
high-mindedness that characterises the better sort of US newspaper and which
makes even The Independent seem vulgar.
That became especially obvious to anybody who landed in Washington in the
middle of the Gay Rights March a couple of weeks ago. It was hard to find
anywhere to stay: one wondered if those who were able to occupy nearly all
the rooms in Dollars 220-a-night hotels wholly deserved the large additions
to federal spending they demanded.
This point could not have been made in The Washington Post which devoted two
sympathetic pages to the march on the day of the event, and even more before
and after.
Now the paper employs an 'Ombudsman' to keep the journalists in line. This
year's examiner of the paper's conscience is one Joann Byrd. A week after
the March she wrote that the Post had done an inadequate job in covering it.
Not all was bad: the paper had at least fully reported the views of those
involved - 'A story that has needed telling since the beginning of
newspapers.' I believe this to be a reference to the failure of the first
Italian Gazzetta in 1560 to publish an account of 'Michelangelo at home' in
its 'Lifestyle' section.
What the Washington Post's ombudsperson had in mind then emerged in a
fascinating assembly of grammatical novelties and syntactical traffic jams.
The paper had dealt with two aspects of the problem of being gay in America
today, but - 'there was a third story and uncharacteristically The Post did
little with it: Gay rights is also a political and public policy story, a
sociology story, a hard-news story of disagreement and discrimination, their
sources and remedy . . . what we did not get was a straightforward status
report on gays, nor the usual measures of the hurdles and the political
environment in which this issue is being argued.' It just goes to show, even
in a two-page overkill you may still not reach boredom's last frontier.
Another item in the Post last week recounted how the University of
Pennsylvania has been shaken by a crisis which erupted when a student, Eden
Jacobowitz, shouted 'Shut up you water buffalo' at five black female
students who were taking part in a sorority celebration one night on the
sidewalk below his window. He was therefore caught in the university's
Speech Code which is designed to ensure nobody is ever offended again.
'Experts' were brought in to decide whether 'water buffalo' had a history as
a racial epithet, one faculty member arguing that the creature was a large
black animal living in Africa. It is in fact an Asian brown animal.
Jacobowitz explained that he had translated it from the Yiddish behema which
has no racial content. The importance of the matter lies partly in the fact
that the President of Penn State, Sheldon Hackney, is President Clinton's
choice to head the National Endowment of the Humanities. He is, needless to
say, a supporter of the Speech Code.
To its credit the Post did head a subsequent editorial, 'Speech code
silliness.' It published a section of the code which showed what Americans
are up against if they want to express themselves - a listener has only to
infer that a direct injury is intended for the speaker to be judged guilty.
In Europe it is unlikely that one would be caught up in a semi-judicial
enquiry as a result of shouting the names of Asian oxen at one's colleagues.
But then a European would have been in trouble had he opted for the proper
American alternative available to Jacobowitz - merely threatening the
alleged water buffaloes with an AK47.
The obsessive concern of the US is not, as is sometimes believed, with the
rights of individuals, but with the rights of individuals as members of a
class. In the US anyone can buy a rifle because there is thought to be a
general right to own guns. Those who do not own guns have, as such, no
rights, however terrified they may be of their neighbours. This is because
there is no recognised class of non-gun owners. In most of Europe the
individual is by and large protected from gunmen because gun-owning is an
exceptional right.
This gulf in attitudes accounts for the difference that exists between
newspapers in Europe and the US. The latter are devoted to what one might
call regulatory matters, to the arbitration of absurd conflicts, to the
definition of an absolute right to free speech in a society which demands
absolute protection from verbal injury, and to the endless insistence on
'the rights of us.'
No wonder people on Dollars 250,000 a year see themselves as victims. No
wonder people like David Koresh become significant figures.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Private View: English thoroughbred shows his class - Top
trainer Henry Cecil can be flippant about himself but never about
horseflesh. As Derby day draws near, he is looking like the front runner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPRING IS cantering into summer and it is time to get in form for the
greatest popular festival of the English season, the Epsom Derby on June 2.
Where better to start than Warren Place, Newmarket?
Name: Henry Cecil. Age 50.
Form: first outing 1969. Nine times champion trainer, twice Derby winner.
Wayward as a colt but has trained on well. A stayer. Has first three
ante-post Derby favourites, Tenby, Commander in Chief, Armiger (all owned by
Khaled Abdulla, a Saudi prince).
Conformation: over 18 hands, long legs, small rump, easy gait.
Pedigree: direct descendant of William Cecil, Lord Burghley, chancellor to
Queen Elizabeth I of England. Twin son of the Hon. Henry Cecil (killed in
action in North Africa, aged 28) and Elizabeth Rohays Burnett, daughter of
13th baronet of Leys (Crathes Castle).
Schooled: at Newmarket by trainer stepfather ('Uncle Cecil') Boyd-Rochfort.
Sunningdale Prep (failed Eton entrance), crammer and Canford, Dorset. Nine O
levels. Nearest university Cambridge (14 miles). First wife Julie is
daughter of famed trainer Sir Noel Murless.
Outlook: soulful eye, Mephistophelean smile, the 'Cecil nose'. Bold, rakish,
eccentric. Jilly Cooper-style hero. Looks genuine.
* * *
There were two Porsches in the drive when I drew up at Henry Cecil's house,
a riot of flowers around the satellite dish on the front lawn and a kitsch
nude arching backwards on the coffee table.
Cecil can be flippant about himself but never about horseflesh. I asked him
which he preferred.
'On the whole I find horses probably easier. I like people, but they can be
disappointing. I think horses are very noble by comparison.'
What does it mean to say that a horse is noble?
'If you know horses it's rather like a dog. I mean, if you've got a mean and
miserable dog you would probably get the feeling it's miserable. You can
tell a lot about a horse from his outlook - the way he looks and whether
he's got a sort of good clean eye.'
Outlook?
'People have a good face or a bad face. Do you trust a person with his eyes
too close together? Ears are important in a person. There are people who use
themselves properly when they walk and people who don't; people have good
feet and bad feet, good limbs and bad limbs.'
He added: 'I never buy a horse with small ears because it's always
ungenuine.'
Meaning?
'They don't try.'
Why should a horse with small ears not be a tryer?
'You tell me. It's a fact.'
Do other people agree with you?
'I haven't asked them. But I've had a lot of horses with small ears and
they've never been any good - wouldn't try. Arkle had very long ears, and
Mill Reef. Conformation is very important.'
You once said you judge a horse from behind, to see if it has the swagger of
a beautiful girl, I prompted him.
'Yeh, a swagger . . . means they're putting their hocks underneath them. A
lot of power comes from the hock.'
Cecil speaks in small bursts, each ending on an interrogatory note with a
barely audible 'mmm?' or 'yeh?'. He wants you to agree.
I said: I suppose you're not enough of a chauvinist to compare fillies to
women, are you?
'Probably very similar. Very similar. They've all got a lot of character.
They just a take a little bit of understanding. When you have a good one
they're very genuine. You can't beat a good filly, But you know, you can't
push. If you've had a bad winter, cold spring, you might find they just
don't come. You've just got to sit and wait and when the weather changes
suddenly they sort of open up like flowers. If you force the pace they just
go backwards.'
The horticultural analogy is not an accident. Cecil loves his garden,
specialising in old-fashioned roses which derive, like him, from Scottish
briar. He can rhapsodise about a rare blue flower he found on the nearby
Devil's Dyke.
Do successful trainers have green fingers, like gardeners?
'I can't judge other people. But I know a lot of my work is just instinct. I
just sort of have a feeling about things.'
In my limited experience horses are either stupid or neurotic. Cecil would
have none of it.
'Some can be highly-strung. Depends entirely how they're treated. If you
treat them with respect and get their confidence you can eliminate a lot of
that. They're not stupid. They never forget.'
Are there any delinquents?
'It's amazing how they can come round. Now and again you get the odd horse
which is bad-tempered. But I might have one out of 160 every two or three
years. There are three things you need: patience, patience and patience.'
Do you talk to your horses?
'I do in a sort of silly language like you do to a dog . . . I talk to my
dogs in a ridiculous way. I crawl all over the floor with a Bonio in my
mouth. Horses like attention. Really good horses love attention. And they
know when they're good, too.'
Cecil's handling of horses is a matter of record. I asked him what he was
like with people.
'I'm not a snob. I don't find I have any difficulty in socially mixing with
anybody. I can deal with people. I've had to deal with them. I know what you
can ask them, what to expect.'
Are you good at man-management?
'I like to think I am, yeh. I have a staff here which very seldom anybody
leaves: all work well together, nobody's cracking a whip. I employ people
for maybe seven, eight hours a day and after that their life's their own.
We've all got to work, so let's enjoy it.'
Are you a convert to the work ethic, I asked. You had a riotous youth.
'Yeh. I was quite wild. My father was quite wild, from what I hear. I'm much
more settled now. I mean, leopards don't change their spots, do they? I do
like a little bit of fun, I like the funny side of things. But I'm not a
very social person.'
You're more grown-up now?
'I don't think I'll ever grow up. I've always got a wild streak in me. I
don't want to grow up really. I rather like being sort of . . . village
idiot now and again. I like people taking the mickey out of me actually. I
like to be the slight buffoon, yeh? Another thing: I think it's an advantage
in a lot of ways. You can sort of give that impression but underneath . . .
if you get them to relax then you're on a very good wicket, you're holding
the cards.
I thought of the nine O levels. Are you much brighter than you let on?
'I'm not a sort of intellectual, but I wouldn't say I'm stupid.'
Though born with a silver-plated spoon this Henry is no Hooray. 'I hate that
sort of boring facade,' he said. 'I find it pathetic and uninteresting -
characterless - the cavalry twills and club ties. I used to go racing in
purple and yellow check trousers and white shoes, to Goodwood. I like more
conservative clothes now, blues, greys, herring-bone jackets.' Cecil has an
enormous wardrobe (last estimate 150 shirts, 100 pairs of shoes, especially
Gucci).
He does not feel middle-aged. 'No, I'm still very juvenile in that sort of
way. Not altered very much. Probably one's work . . . one doesn't fool
around or play as much as one used to because with one's business and work
it's harder. I've got responsibility now. Got to go on working. I was
divorced . . . Quite expensive.'
Cecil's divorce from Julie, a trainer in her own right whose father owned
Warren Place, was the talk of Newmarket and cost him a number of friends. He
asked me not to repeat his thoughts on it. He is married again, to the much
younger Nathalie Payne.
We talked about the changing sociology of English racing. Was old money
easier to work with than new?
'Not really. I'm lucky. I train for some very nice people. Some very good
new owners have come in in the last few years.'
Is racing more egalitarian?
'Yes, you've got syndicates and partnerships and firms owning horses and
every sort of thing, and it's one big club. I mean, everybody plays their
part in the thing, whether it be the butcher, the candlestick-maker or
whether it be Lord Howard de Walden or our friends from the Middle East.
'There's opportunity for everybody. You don't have to be a very rich man,
you don't have to have thousands of horses to be successful. There is always
that marvellous element of luck. A lot of good horses have been bought very
very cheaply - we're talking about Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 10,000, yeh?'
If stables were schools, what school would yours be?
'Well, I suppose it would definitely be an Eton or a Harrow, wouldn't it?
With the inmates, the quality of horses. But it wouldn't be run on those
lines.'
However, Cecil admitted that, like a successful headmaster, he can afford to
tell owners to take their horses away if they are not passing their exams.
But the business is becoming ever more competitive. Newmarket, like the City
of London, may lose out to equine centres abroad, Cecil said, particularly
if the government did not stop 'bleeding and bleeding the racing industry'
through VAT and betting tax.
'They're very shortsighted. I mean, I'm a Conservative. I don't know why. I
really don't. A Labour government would probably be better for racing.'
The languid Cecil became animated. 'I always think if you can't do anything
in life, be a politician. I mean some of them are so stupid, aren't they?
Aren't they? You go into the House of Commons, the House of Lords at six
o'clock at night and they're all plastered, aren't they? Tripping over each
other.'
The mention of drink reminded me. Are you a teetotaller now? I asked him.
'I don't drink very much. I drink beer. I don't drink spirits. I'm not very
good when I drink a lot, so I'm careful.'
Champagne?
'I'm not very keen on champagne.'
You have to believe a man - especially one with the ears of a Derby winner.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Off with their hands]: Dominic Lawson welcomes tougher
sentences but says the law could go further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT SEEMS only yesterday that the former Home Secretary, Kenneth Baker,
brought in the Criminal Justice Act. But now Kenneth Clarke, his successor
is to alter two of that measure's key provisions.
The new system under which fines are means-tested will be neutered - no more
Pounds 3,000 fines for well-to-do litter-droppers. The no less new
injunction that magistrates should not take previous offences into account
when deciding on sentencing will apparently be removed.
While the original legislation introducing means-tested fines was
ill-thought out and most unTory, I think it was well-intentioned, as a way
of preventing crime by a novel form of anti-middle class deterrence. But the
law that prevented magistrates from treating recidivists more harshly than
the first-time offender, and which has rightly succumbed to criticism from
the Lord Chief Justice, could never have been anything other than an attempt
to reduce the prison population, and let the public take the consequences.
The legislation arose, not out of a desire to see crime properly punished,
but to save the Home Office from the incident which its civil servants dread
above anything else: a prison riot. Riots had been breaking out with
increasing frequency, and the cause, it seemed to the Home Office, was
overcrowding.
The rational answer was to build more prisons, but that is a long-term
solution, and something was needed in the short term to reduce the prison
population.
What could be more natural than to impose conditions which would minimise
sentences? Indeed, the policy has been a success: the growth in the prison
population has been reversed. Unfortunately the rise in crime has continued,
fuelled by the villains' knowledge that the chances of condign punishment
has been greatly reduced.
It was often joked in ministerial circles that the most difficult job in
government was the one that Kenneth Baker had just had: nobody has more
cause to laugh ruefully at that, than Kenneth Clarke. But it is not enough
to revoke the most obviously loony aspects of the Criminal Justice Act.
As Mrs Beeton might have said: first catch your criminal. To some extent
tougher sentencing will lead to more criminals being caught. For the police,
much of the satisfaction of their work comes from putting criminals away.
The more severe the sentences, the greater the incentive for the police. The
forces of law and order often do not press charges where they should be
pressed, because they judge the work involved unlikely to be rewarded by the
removal of the criminal from society.
In recent months we have been burgled, once in the country, once in London.
On both occasions the only apparent action taken by the police was to send
my name and address to counselling agencies. Thus last week we received a
letter which read: 'We are sorry to hear from the police that you have been
the victim of a recent crime. If you would like someone to visit you to talk
through the experience, please get in touch with us'.
We also received a letter from Rochester Row police station, which began: 'I
am sorry to hear that you have been a victim of crime . . . the crime is
being investigated by an officer whose name is shown above.' No name
'appeared above', unless 'Burglary Squad' is the name of an officer.
I suppose I should not sneer at attempts by the police to be
'user-friendly', and I suppose I should talk to the carers at the South
Westminster Victims' Support Scheme if only to cheer them up by giving the
impression that their services are not entirely useless. The only thing
which would cheer ME up is the thought that the intruder who broke into our
house might be captured, and, if he were captured, that he would be made
very miserable for a long time.
I confess that having also, in the past fortnight, had my car twice broken
into, my attitude to criminal justice has hardened. In the small hours, as I
lie awake anticipating the sound of breaking glass, my mind wanders to Saudi
Arabia, where persistent thieves can have their hands cut off and I
speculate what would happen if we merged the Westminster parliamentary
system with an Islamic code. Perhaps that is something for the next home
secretary to consider.

TENNIS lessons. Chess lessons. My life at present is a whirlwind of
instruction. Yesterday it was a chess lesson, one of a series that I and two
friends are having to prepare ourselves for the Nigel Short-Gary Kasparov
world chess tussle in London in September. The two friends are: John Major,
prime minister of Britain, and Queen Elizabeth II, head of the House of
Windsor. Our instructor is Nigel Short himself. We meet in utmost secrecy.
Unusually, the Queen was accompanied by the Seven Dwarfs, her seven Welsh
corgis, who are notorious, at Buckingham Palace, for savaging the flunkies.
But the Queen soon settled them. Before the lesson started she produced
seven silver bowls into which she spooned caviar. The dwarfs gobbled it
greedily and collapsed in a malevolent heap.
'That's put paid to them,' she said. 'Nigel - let us start. One must get
away on time. There are more ructions brewing - more media allegations.
Where will it all end? Not that one isn't inured. No es para tanto.'
'Right-ho,' said Nigel, whose own mental and physical preparation for his
match against Kasparov the barbarian is proceeding smoothly. 'Today I
thought we'd study sacrificial play in the middle-game, especially
sacrificial play aimed at destroying our opponent's defensive structure.
Remember my golden rule: before launching any sort of attack, sacrificial or
otherwise, always count the number of pieces you will be attacking with and
try to ensure it exceeds the number of pieces your opponent will be
defending with.'
Nigel said he would show us a game he played against Agdestein in 1987,
involving the Greek bishop sacrifice. With grandmasterly finesse he set up
the pieces and moved them at great speed, so that all we could see was a
blur of pawns and bishops and cleverly skulking knights.
'Right,' said Nigel. 'This brings us to move 14. From here, play went: 14,
Bxh7+, Kxh7; 15, Ng5+, Kg8; 16, Qd3, Rfe8. So how did play continue?'
John Major wriggled and frowned. 'I must say, Nigel,' he said, 'that
sacrificial play leaves me with feelings of considerable unease. It does not
seem logical to throw away a perfectly stalwart piece when you are doing
jolly well anyway and embark upon a course of action that is little short of
reckless. It reminds me of politics. I am being urged at the present time to
sacrifice Norman Lamont, my chancellor of the exchequer. But as Michael has
pointed out, alone among his colleagues, Norman is a hero, a man of
considerable stature. Why should I cast him out?'
The Queen trilled with merriment. 'In one's own line of business,' she said,
'one gets accustomed to stratagems, especially mid-game sacrifices. You work
to five-year terms. A monarch thinks in centuries. Qui non proficit deficit.
Anyway, the answer to Nigel's little teaser is strikingly obvious. What
follows must be: 17, Qh7+, Kf8; 18, f5] . . . '
'Absolutely brill,' said Nigel. 'Exactly how it happened. Then I put the
boot in. It was completely open house.'
'Nigel]' exclaimed the Queen. 'One wishes you hadn't said that. Completely
open house. That is one's current strategem, one's sop to the
anti-monarchists, but one would rather you didn't remind one. Can you
imagine the mess and noise when Buckingham Palace is thrown open to the
populace this summer? One is dreading it entirely. And what will they be
gawking at? Just a load of art works, mainly dusty pictures. One is sending
the dwarfs to Scotland. They are liable to go berserk.'
I had been quiet until now, but I could not resist the opening. I said: 'I
agree with the character in Barry Unsworth's novel, Stone Virgin, who says,
in all seriousness, that great works of art are more important than people -
that life can spawn more life, but that you can't spawn Gothic Madonnas.
'Look at the floods in Venice in 1966, which triggered off countless
restoration projects and set the money flowing. 'If it hadn't been Venice,'
says this character, 'if there had only been people to worry about, what
would anyone have done? I'll tell you. They would have sent a few food
parcels and forgotten all about it'.'
The Queen smiled. She said: 'Michael does go on.' She revived the dwarfs
with smelling salts and telephoned for her car and detective. The rest of us
did the same. So ended our second lesson.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Arts: Interlude in the sun - Missing Glyndebourne this year?
Antony Thorncroft ventured further afield in search of alfresco opera, to
Barbados
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMEHOW opera suits the great outdoors. Voices drifting across lawns and
copses; dusk falling between the acts; the singers competing with the last
bird song and the first crickets. A refined architectural backdrop, a
Palladian villa, perhaps, or an English country house, helps, for dramatic
exits and entrances.
Glyndebourne has successfully married the best of nature with the best of
opera for over half a century and has provided a template for many wealthy
enthusiasts. Look out this summer for Garsington, the former demesne of Lady
Otteline Morrell: it is beefing up its opera festival to capture the
Glyndebourne aficionados suffering cold turkey while a new theatre emerges
in the South Downs. Watching Alfredo stalk down the avenue of the most
meticulously modelled Palladian villa outside of the Veneto, and following
Papageno into the trees of a lush 'English' garden seems somehow familiar,
reassuring, just so - even when you are in the audience for the first
professional opera production ever assembled in Barbados.
The Caribbean islands can no longer compete on sun, sea and sand. The market
is getting bored. Barbados is superbly placed to become the cultural haunt
of the region, the spot to go for some mental uplift to add to the tan. It
has an uninterrupted history of British colonisation going back to 1625,
with 17th century plantation houses decorating the countryside, protected by
a vigorous National Trust.
It also has a generation of the lively rich who want to make the most of the
island - and do a bit for charity, too. Hence the first Caribbean opera
festival, dreamed up by Richard Hanlon over a Christmas lunch at the 18th
century plantation home of John Kidd, and in place by Easter. The singers
came from one of those myriad troupes of chamber operas who make a good
living performing at corporate bashes and smart parties. Opera Interludes is
from the same stable as Pavilion Opera, Pimlico Opera, Chelsea Opera and the
like and shares some of the singers. It is an excellent way for young
artistes to learn major roles, and to test themselves as actors.
La Traviata took place at Heron Bay, the towering seashore Palladian house
that Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe designed for Ronald Tree. It is now owned by the
Bamford family. The roar of the sea pushed the performance into the back
terrace; a tropical power cut added its moment of drama. La Traviata is not
perhaps the most obvious chamber opera. No chorus of gypsys; no Baron, in
this four singer version. In Helen Adams, a Donna Elvira at the ENO, there
was a Violetta whose voice just about compensated for a sad absence of
flirtatious triste. But the set - long gravel walks, decorated iron gates,
scented borders and towering tropical trees, was stunning.
At Holder's House there was a truncated Magic Flute, no bad idea. Here
nature again transformed the performances, with Philip Blake-Jones and Anne
Marabini as Papageno and Papagena making the opera almost a bucolic rite.
Afterwards there were popular favourites, culminating in the farewell duet
from Guonod's Faust, the voices echoing back across a velvet night from a
wooded glade.
Finally, there were Mozart favourites on the Palm Terrace of the Royal
Pavilion, the smartest hotel in Barbados. The attraction of the event was
not purely sybaritic. Young music students were invited to the performances
and the success of the idea has encouraged a more ambitious programme for
1993, involving local singers in the chorus, and complete operas. Pirates of
Penzance, with the chorus entering from the beach, is one; something sparky
by Donizetti or Lehar another. The tyros who fell into the idea are
currently surprised by its success; the next step is to become more
artistically ambitious without losing the sense of fun.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Arts: Search and Destroy - Andrew St George hails Howard
Korder's play at the Royal Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHY CAN'T the English write vibrant plays like the sizzling American piece,
Search and Destroy by Howard Korder at The Royal Court? Here is a sharp
modern morality play, alive to contemporary issues and knowing about
contemporary forms, a Pilgrim's Progress for the 1990s, Death of a Salesman
for the information age. It makes exciting, energetic drama.
Korder centres the action on his Everyman, one Martin Mirkheim, on stage or
video throughout the play. He is a small time businessman from Boca Raton,
Florida. He is besotted by a self-help book called 'Daniel Strong' (a
reference to the real 1990s best-seller, Iron John), and wants to produce
the movie of the book. So in quest of a moral end - making lives better - he
sets about money raising. This takes him to New York and leads him into drug
dealing with los Colombianos and on to homicide. Martin and his partner Kim
kill a traffic cop; then Martin clubs Kim to death.
Later, Martin goes West, trades his tan suit for a lilac jacket and
turquoise shirt, and makes it in Hollywood. Then a blackmailer turns up
brandishing unpaid taxes and subpoenas. Martin meets him, holds a gun in the
right hand and a cash envelope in the left; he says, 'One of these is for
you.' The blackmailer chooses the envelope - 'I believe this is mine' - and
leaves Martin to burn up the papers, excise the past.
Morally, the play feeds off the self-help movement: forget the past, change
yourself, look to the future, believe in possibilities, be all you can be.
But Korder shows how the no-past theory breaks down when forgiving yourself
means ignoring your murdering, drug-dealing, tax-evading past.
Technically Search and Destroy (1990) combines the plot of Robert Altman's
fine movie, The Player (1992) with David Mamet's early play Edmond (another
one-way ticket from prosperity to wretchedness) and American Buffalo (1975)
which also erupts into violence. Korder has the sharp dialogue of novelist
Elmore Leonard and the Miami sass of journalist Carl Hiaasen. What emerges
is a play which brings together film and fiction.
Throughout, the dialogue is pared down, elided. The more intimate the
scenes, the further apart the actors, carrying the energies across the
stage. The set, in the refurbished Royal Court Upstairs, is a blank glossy
tiled surface, with four TV screens and a lowered ceiling which serves as a
table and doubles as a car.
The director, Stephen Daldry, is into design details. Martin's yuppie
partner smokes Camels and lights them with a Zippo; Ron, the link with the
Colombian narcos, wears leather jeans and Nike hi-tops (he says, 'I don't
look good in clothes'). Elsewhere, the Raybans and margueritas are perfectly
matched, the swimsuit aptly encrusted with Zirconium, and the lounge suits
appropriately pinstriped or plain.
David Bamber as Martin is excellent; he moves from fear through
incomprehension to violence with ease. Andrew Woodall as the suave Kim is a
wonderfully outdated 1980s model American. Other highlights include Cathryn
Bradshaw as a scriptwriting secretary and Danny Webb as a twitchy Media
cocaine addict. The best line is shouted by an apoplectic shrink: 'Get me .
. . something chocolate.'

FT  08 MAY 93 / Arts: Brideshead revisited - this time on stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVELYN WAUGH (1903-66) wrote Brideshead Revisited in 1945. In a stage
premiere by the Snap Theatre Company at the Swan Theatre, Worcester, it
seems more serious than itself, much more like Eliot's The Cocktail Party
(1950) or Rodney Ackland's The Dark River (1941). The play sets out to be a
corrective to the nectared nostalgia of Granada's lavish 1980 TV series.
However, the familiar characters, or rather ciphers, have still not shaken
off the Granada heritage. The Swan production, adapted by Roger Parsley and
directed by Andy Graham (who appeared in the TV Brideshead), still owes much
in tone to Granada. What Waugh wrote in the 1959 preface to Brideshead
speaks for the history of the book and its representations: 'a gluttony for
the splendours of the recent past'  - Granada revisited.
The story of Charles Ryder's obsession with the Marchmain family and in
particular Sebastian Flyte and his sister Julia is overlaid with Catholic
excess and guilt. Julia says: 'The worse I am, the more I need God.' These
three are the most perplexed and engaging characters; around them a cast of
1920s academics, socialites and aristocrats hovers like gnats over Christ
Church meadow. Anyone who crossed Waugh's path was immediately made into a
figure of absurdity and ridicule. The persistent Oxford context (the House,
Old Tom, Mercury) gives the novel and the play a Zuleika Dobson feel, but
the action stays clear. The rest is Aloysius the teddy bear, plovers' eggs
and Moet.
The adaptation crams Waugh's text into 34 scenes. Ryder's memories are
spread out laterally on the stage, a living portrait of a dying family. The
here-and-now of Ryder's 1943 army billet contrasts perfectly with the blue
remembered hills of early adulthood. The action does move elegantly between
scenes, but Lady Marchmain appears to have strayed in from Ambridge,
constantly 'having a word' or 'wanting a chat.' And it was brave to abandon
Waugh's haunting last line spoken by an adjutant to Ryder as the troops
settle into the billet, 'You're looking unusually cheerful today.'
The cast of seven plus teddy play 15 of the more memorable characters in the
novel, as well as some minor ones. The acting is everywhere tactful and
thoughtful, with particularly versatile performances from Barney Long (as
Samgrass, Sebastian's academic minder, and Lord Marchmain) and Brian Orrell
(as Boy Mulcaster and Brideshead). The principals, Andrew Loudon as Charles
and David Willoughby as Sebastian flirt with the sexual relationship hinted
at in Waugh. Lisa Turner as a sexy, troubled Julia is excellent.
The Swan Theatre, Worcester (0905 27322) until May 8

FT  08 MAY 93 / Arts: What a carry on] - Video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST CONSIDER this. A director puts a surprise plot twist in his new film
and begs critics not to reveal it. Under this pact of silence the film does
poor-to-modest business. Then the surprise is blown by the Oscar
nominations, after which the film - The Crying Game if you have not guessed
 -starts to make a fortune.
As the only British film critic who thought the interdiction was twaddle in
the first place - FT readers could learn the twist in my original review,
where it was preceded by a courtesy warning for those wanting to preserve
the surprise - may I now welcome the video? At last we can all judge The
Crying Game (Polygram) as a piece of film-making, not as a PR exercise in
patronising mystification.
Those who hold sway over our movie lives, of course, would like to treat us
all as children. They would like to believe we cannot make up our own minds
whether to see a particular movie, video or TV programme; nor whether to
read a piece of plot revelation in a review, even when protected by the
critic's own warning lights. There is less difference than we think between
those who censor our screen entertainment and those who control the way a
film is released and publicised. Condescension and autocracy are common to
both.
Why all these expostulations, you ask? Because movie presentation is
becoming an art increasingly prone to gimmickry and imposture. And because
so many bizarre changes - additions, subtractions, transpositions - are now
happening to films when they graduate to the after-life of videotape that
you should be aware of just when and how you are being pushed around. Not
just by the censors but by the film-makers, the hype artists and whoever
else tries to extract your money, to disarm you with 'Don't reveal]' plot
secrets or to bluff you into thinking a film is an enhanced masterpiece in
its latest, newest, most arbitrary format.
So we have appointed May a multiple-choice 'special event' month. It is
'Don't Think An Expanded Movie Is Always A Better One' month. Is, for
instance, the extra footage in the new, 176-minute-long Betty Blue (Fox) an
enrichment or does it turn erotic chic into amorous marathon? And what of
the initially fascinating Godfather expansions, now showing signs of
slipping into a self-parodying prolixity. See the imminent, even longer,
even more amorphous Godfather III.
It is 'Don't Trust Companies Who Serve Up The Same Film In Different
Formats' (and then pretend it is a whole new video experience) month. We
appreciate the increasing choice of widescreen reissues of films like (this
month) Oliver] and Gandhi (both Columbia). But some will argue that these
films should have been presented this way, with their true original screen
ratios, in the first place. Why have we had our pockets raided twice?
And it is 'Take Two Pinches Of Salt With The Director Who Appears On His Own
Video To Recount His Artistic Struggles' month. We refer to Adrian Lyne,
whose on-screen agonisings over Fatal Attraction's alternative endings add
to the morbid-curiosity value of the video if not to the film's stature as
an artwork. But other movie-makers are already rumoured to be signing on for
this stunt.
But it is May, as we observed, so let us end by dancing a little round those
gaily-coloured new releases with which we have no quarrel. Splendid to see
Howards End (Curzon) trailing Oscar glory onto the small screen; and please
catch Emma T. also in the funny, underrated Peter's Friends (EV EVV),
directed by husband Ken.
Excellent to note the multiplying number of foreign movies on video: this
month two vintage Rohmers, The Marquise Von O and Pauline A La Plage (both
Connoisseur), Zhang Yimou's majestic marital melodrama Raise The Red Lantern
(Electric) and Kieslowski's haunting teaser on love and identity The Double
Life Of Veronique (Tartan). And wonderful to see twelve vintage 'Carry On'
films reissued by Warner. Please carry on, gentlemen, through the whole
cannon.

THE LOVERS by Morris West Heinemann Pounds 14.99, 314 pages
IN THE PLACE OF FALLEN LEAVES by Tim Pears Hamish Hamilton Pounds 14.99, 320
pages
DAUGHTERS by Paule Marshall Serpent's Tail Pounds 9.99, 408 pages
MORRIS WEST does not tell stories. He spins dashed good yarns. His
28-volume, 60 million copy career has propelled a sequence of lean, brawny
heroes under desert and ocean skies to wrestle with and to vanquish their
moral adversaries. Forty years on the formula, which owes as much to Graham
Greene as to Wilbur Smith, is as engaging as ever. The Lovers, promised by
the publishers to be his last book, shows the maturing of West's craft.
The setting is a sumptuous yacht in the unspoiled Mediterranean of the early
1950s. As to be expected, the cast of characters is larger than life: a
haughty contessa, a sadistic Irish-American millionaire, a Vatican
financier. Into their intrigues plunges one Bryan de Courcy Cavanagh, a
virile multilingual Australian late of the Pacific campaign. Cavanagh loses
his innocence but wins the affections of the contessa and the respect of Big
Money. In the meantime the Old World proves itself irredeemably corrupt,
willing to sell its soul for Yankee dollars. It is racy stuff, lucidly
written and spiced by allusions to the Vatican's hand in securing the escape
of Nazi war criminals and in promoting the plunder of the Italian coast for
tourism.
The romance is less convincing, however, and so is the dialogue, which
resonates oddly in Orson Wellesian mock-Irish, irrespective of who among the
motley crew is speaking. The flourishes in the slick narrative mostly work
well, giving a dreamy cadence to this grown man's fantasy. At other times,
as when we are told that the ship 'handled like a contented woman,' one
fears the wine dark sea is merely purple.
Such lapses are not to be found in Tim Pears's delightful, smooth flowing
first novel In the Place of Fallen Leaves. Here the landscape is Devon,
green and rolling though scorched by the hot summer of 1984. The drought
will not break and the schools are closed by a teachers' strike. For Alison,
a 13-year-old farmgirl, time seems to have stopped, and even to slide
backwards through three generations of her family's lives.
The characters peopling Alison's village become vehicles for an exploration
of the different facets of love. For one brother it is a coldblooded hunt,
for another pure intoxication. For the thoughtful village rector it comes as
light from an unexpected source. For mother it is sheer endurance. From this
small valley Pears unearths passion, jealousy and betrayal. Gently evoking
the daily toil of farm life, he punctuates it with moments of magic realist
whimsy.
Reminiscent of Faulkner and Garcia Marquez, the writing retains a very
English scale, closely observed and lyrical, never straining credulity. The
West Country speech is skilfully rendered, and there is a wealth of
description. One memorable passage grippingly details a caesarean birth
performed by the taciturn village gelder. If there is a flaw it is that
Pears dabbles somewhat unconvincingly with Marquesian circularity. Overall,
however, the book is a triumph. Jackets on subsequent editions, one
imagines, will be well plastered with adjectives: sensitive, heartwarming,
hallucinatory.
It is a very different voice that comes from Paule Marshall, warm,
African-American, strident, polemical. Her seventh and latest book,
Daughters, arrives loaded with praise from across the Atlantic, and with
good reason. The novel is well written, its characters compellingly
portrayed. Its subject is the central issue facing black Americans in the
post civil rights era, which is no longer white racism but rather the
question of identity.
Ursa Mackenzie, the protagonist, stands between a rock and a hard place. The
rock is the Caribbean island where she grew up and where her father is a
politician whose ideals are increasingly compromised by the reality of
dependence. The hard place is New York City, where she struggles to
contribute to black advancement in the face of indifference and betrayal.
She finds that courage can make a difference, but it is a lonely road.
The book is enlightening about the pain of being black and female in a
hostile world. It is particularly good about Caribbean politics. There is a
tendency to sententiousness that speaks of overindulgence in the two PCs
plagueing modern America: political correctness and the personal computer.
Every touchstone of gender and race politics must, it seems, be cited, from
rape to abortion to male infidelity to police harassment. And at 400 pages
the book is excessively word processed.

NOT BECAUSE it was a quarter of a century ago, simply as an interesting
year, Radio 3 offers a 1968 Season for a week or two. Myself, I enjoyed
1968. I went to the theatre 208 times, I spent ten days in Venice, I heard
Gwyneth Jones as Sieglinde in Die Walkure; but in retrospect I think
everyone, even me, took things too seriously, as Radio 3 does now. In That
Was the Year, That Was, Alan Bennett recalled his happy times with John
Gielgud in Forty Years On; Jonathan Miller regretted not having pursued his
neuropsychology and insisted that his televised Alice in Wonderland was
Wordsworthian rather than satirical; Peter Hall recalled his move from the
Royal Shakespeare Company to the not-yet-royal National; Michael Frayn began
writing novels because he had no more to say in his newspaper column.
Nothing significant, unless you count Peter Hall. Comparatively few of the
items seem actually to have happened in 1968, anyway. Of Hits of 1968, only
'The Age of Aquarius' meant anything to me, and that not much.
Peter Barnes's The Ruling Class is the first of four 1968 plays to be
revived. In Nottingham that year, it ran nearly three-and-a-half hours, but
when it reached the West End (in 1969) it had lost 20 minutes, and Radio 3
plays it in two hours and 20 minutes, a real improvement, though there is
still much dispensable frivolity. Lunatic Jack (versatile Simon Callow)
succeeds as 14th Earl of Gurney, believing that he is Jesus Christ, married
to Marguerite Gautier. A German psychiatrist 'cures' him by confrontation
with a rival God, so instead of the loving New Testament Deity, Jack now
becomes the vengeful Old Testament God. Moreover, being Jack, he is also
Jack the Ripper. This is how he is to take his seat in the Lords. No one but
a few Oxford students could have thought that hereditary peers, mad or sane,
were vital in the government of the country, but there is some fun. Gerry
Jones directed.
I am conscious of devoting too little space to Radio 5, so here are some
notes on three series that began this week, no candidates for historical
importance. On Monday we enter Mark Davies Markham's The Mall, a new
shopping centre. All the population sound like teenagers, even when they are
a bit over. Jonathan is sacked for stealing just before the opening, so he
and Mickey break in and bust it up. There are to be 14 parts, so we may hope
for high adventure.
Hatches, Matches and Despatches on Tuesdays is lightweight education. This
week was Hatches, a fascinating array of customs, superstitions, folklore
and general knowledge connected with the birth of children, not only in
Britain but among the Sikhs, Hindus, Moslems, Chinese and others. John
Walters was the presenter.
On Thursday we had the first of seven stories about The Green Hornet, a a
respectable newspaperman until there is a matter that he must put right, and
for this he dons a sinister disguise. The series was first heard in 1936 on
Detroit Radio and played for 16 years thereafter. This week we had the
dishonest exploitation of a charity, and as it began with one of the
directors handing over a bunch of signed blank cheques to his colleague,
dishonesty was no surprise.
Once again we find radio supplanting the magazines. The equivalent of this
kind of material might have been found in Chums or The Modern Boy, though I
do not think they would have used delinquency so blithely for entertainment.
Not that Jonathan or the dishonest charity is defended, but the existence of
such behaviour is taken for granted - and so it should be. Why not contrive
an exciting serial about car joy-riders who all end up reformed? If radio is
an influence at all, on Radio 5 it is for good.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Arts: Wrestling with ghosts - Poetry in performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS week the Poetry Society hosted a tribute to Sidney Keys, a poet who
died exactly 50 years ago in the Tunisian Campaign at the age of 20, just
two weeks into his active service. The evening was as much a meeting of old
friends and an opportunity to exchange reminiscences as an account of the
poet's life and work. Keys' editor Michael Meyer and the poet John
Heath-Stubbs were the presenters. Both men had been friends of Keys at
Oxford, where he read history for five terms until the war beckoned.
Their memories of half a century ago were impressively sharp. According to
Meyer, Keys, although a man who tended to prefer the companionship of books
to that of the living, was amiable enough - if at times a little dour.
In 1941, Meyer and Keys edited a volume of undergraduate poetry together
entitled Eight Oxford Poets. Keys excluded from it the work of another
Oxford contemporary, Philip Larkin, on the grounds of quality - a judgment
with which the wearisomely uncritical Andrew Motion, Larkin's official
biographer, concurs. This painful exclusion caused Larkin to speak with
bitterness of Keys, and to denigrate his reputation, until the end of his
life.
Keys worked hard at his poetry and had developed a mature voice and manner
by the time of his death. He described himself in a late letter as 'an
uncomfortable metaphysical without roots', who would rather have been born
in 19th century Oxfordshire than near London between the wars. That remark
draws attention both to his achievements as a nature poet in the manner of
Clare and Wordsworth, and to his interests in philosophy and symbolism,
where his masters were the German poet Rilke and WB Yeats. Keys wrote much
about death as his own approached, borrowing from Rilke the idea that it is
a creature that lives within us with whom it is necessary to come to terms.
In fact, his poetry as a whole wrestles as much with ghosts and angels as it
does with men - which strikes the reader as strangely, if not disturbingly,
premonitory.
'Poets who die in battle tend to get praised for the wrong reasons,
especially by elderly non-combatants,' quipped Meyer. Sidney Keys, though
sentimentalised after his death, has not so much been praised for the wrong
reasons as largely forgotten, which is an injustice because his poetry at
its best has enduring qualities and his war poetry, though none of it
written during his brief period of active service, was driven, like Wilfred
Owen's, by an identification with the helpless conscript.
Michael Mayer, a powerful, stocky man who squares up to the lectern like an
old-time pugilist, read the poems in a gruff, driving baritone. It was a
reading quickened and rendered that much more poignant by his own fond
memories of a long-dead friend who had 'an inner sanctum to which I couldn't
penetrate'.
It is three years since Sinclair-Stevenson launched its own poetry list, and
the publication of four new titles was celebrated by a reading - also at the
Poetry Society - this month. It was an eclectic occasion: the poet John
Fuller read the last poems of his father (who died last year) with a dry,
donnish restraint which seemed entirely appropriate to the material: casual
philosophical reveries that explored such themes as the mysteries of the
energies of art and the paradoxes of old age. These poems are the products
of a mind taking wing after the third drink of the evening as dusk begins to
settle over suburban Blackheath.
The best of Sinclair-Stevenson's new poets was undoubtedly William Scammell
 -who is scarcely a new poet at all, being 54 years old and having already
published six collections. Scammell is a poet of wit and fixed intellectual
convictions whose work encompasses politics, literature - and being a
Lakesman, landscape poetry. Scammell looks boozy and disreputable; and he
has put all this broad experience of life to good use in his robust,
inventive and iconoclastic verse.
Roy Fuller's Last Poems and William Scammell's Five Easy Pieces are
published by Sinclair-Stevenson at Pounds 14.99 and Pounds 7.99
respectively.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Arts: Paintings unfolded - The work of Eugenio Dittborn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHILEAN artist Eugenio Dittborn disarmingly proclaims that 'The politics of
my paintings are in the folds' in the video shown along with his exhibition
of Airmail Paintings at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London. His
'paintings' (the technique of which is predominantly screenprint and
collage) are done on very lightweight translucent material, the kind used as
interlining in clothes, and travel from exhibition to exhibition across the
globe by airmail, folded inside specially designed envelopes. On arrival,
they are simply taken from the envelope, shaken out and pinned to the wall.
A record of their journeyings, the picture title and often a quotation or
other explanatory remark are written on the envelopes, which are exhibited
alongside the works.
Their support may be flimsy, but the works are on a grand scale, both
physically - the unfolded paintings extend for several square feet - and in
subject matter. Using a gallery of found images, photos of faces from old
crime magazines and government records, newspaper photographs, drawings from
an old 'teach yourself to draw' manual and others by his young daughter,
Dittborn explores the issues of identity and communication both between and
within the so-called 'dominant' culture - the history (including art
history) and politics of the west, and that of the 'periphery' - the history
and contemporary life of Chile where Dittborn was born and where he still
lives and works. Their lightweight format enables their journeys to be made
with ease, their intervention into our western artspaces achieved courtesy
of the postal service.
Images are used repeatedly, most strikingly, perhaps, those of individuals
preserved in death, among them the mummified body of a nine year old Inca
boy sacrificed in a religious ceremony and the corpse of a man murdered in
1973 during the military dictatorship. Instead of being merely gruesome
records of suffering, the images in their new context become transformed,
their cruel histories brought before us to ponder and reflect.
One of the most moving pieces couples the image of the political prisoner,
who still wears the blindfold that concealed his executioners from his last
gaze with that of a baby, Dittborn's daughter Margarita, eyes just open,
minutes after her birth, seeing the world for the first time.
Personal sentiment is linked with political horror, beginnings with ends.
The poem 'Night' by Gonzalo Milan, quoted on the painting's envelope says
'And when the night falls, no one knows whether he opens or closes his eyes
. . . whether these are the dreams of yesterday or the nightmares of
tomorrow.'
A new work by Mary Kelly, 'Gloria Patri,' occupies the upper galleries. Its
stated subject is 'The pathology of masculinity.' It consists of a wall
mounted installation of silver trophies, plaques and shields. The trophies
are adorned with phrases such as 'Cut it off and kill it' or 'Kick Ass,'
recorded from television broadcasts made during the Gulf War, the plaques
with strange devices made by cutting military insignia in half and combining
them in random order and the shields with short narratives said to describe
'scenarios which undo a situation of mastery.'
Mastery is a term used in the writings of Jacques Lacan, and the shiny
surfaces of the shields which reflect our faces as we study the texts on
fishing, playing baseball, not eating vegetables, witnessing birth and (the
only one with a woman's voice) exercising, are meant to embody aspects of
his famous 'Mirror Stage.'
Lacan's writing also provided the theoretical basis for Kelly's most famous
work, the 'Post Partum Document', presented at the ICA in 1976, and her
lectures and writing since then have earned her an influential place in the
academic feminist debate. Unlike Document, however (which infamously
displayed stained nappy liners alongside texts written on stone recording
her son's first words and her own anxious record of daily events, making a
powerful point about the the struggle to combine the ordering function of
the artistic process with the chaos of child rearing), the present piece
seems distant from its purported subject. The military and sporting
metaphors it uses might have been worth deeper scrutiny as pointers to the
mysteries of masculinity rather than being pressed into the service of a
dubious theory lacking the underpinning of profound personal experience
which brought the previous work so powerfully to life.
Eugenio Dittborn: Airmail Paintings 1983-1992 until May 30, then touring to
John Hansard Gallery, Southampton, 17 August 17 - September 18 and to
Wellington City Art Gallery, New Zealand. Mary Kelly: Gloria Patri until May

AMERICAN STAR by Jackie Collins Heinemann Pounds 14.99, 568 pages
THE MAN WHO MADE HUSBANDS JEALOUS by Jilly Cooper Bantam Pounds 15.99, 590
pages
GAI-JIN by James Clavell Hodder Pounds 16.99, 1019 pages
SKYLARK'S SONG by Roy Hattersley Macmillan Pounds 14.99, 377 pages
QUESTION. In which of this summer's block-busting best sellers will you find
the following sentence: 'Cor, it's her, the smasher, Angel Tits, wot arrived
couple of weeks ago'? Is it from the latest epic by James Clavell? Jilly
Cooper? Or Jackie Collins?
Actually it could have come from any of them, because the sentiments and the
language are more or less interchangeable between all three, even though one
is set in England, another in America, and the third in Japan more than a
century ago. There is a strict formula for best sellerdom, a way of putting
the stuff across that guarantees a vast and hungry audience all over the
world. Authors depart from it at their peril.
As to which of the three can actually claim the sentence as their own, all
will be revealed. Suffice it for now that the best book of the three, best
by a long way, is the Jackie Collins, American Star. It is the story of a
young stud of humble origin who makes it big in Hollywood, and as such is
not noticeably different to any other novel Collins has ever written.
But people do not read Jackie Collins for something different. They read her
for something exactly the same, the same formula of sex, power and money
that has served them so well in the past and will doubtless continue to for
as long as Collins can keep churning out the words at the rate of 20 pages a
day. She is a brand name as much as anything, a marketing enterprise of
phenomenal proportions.
A good writer too, despite the undeniable trashiness of her material. For
pace and verve, for sheer exuberance on the page, there are few to beat her.
There is a wonderful moment in American Star when the stud's girlfriend is
about to be raped by another man and is at her wits' end how to prevent it.
The way Collins sets the scene up, it looks as if nothing on earth can save
the poor girl from her fate.
But then she glances out of the window and notices a passing tornado, which
opportunely picks up her trailer and flings it down again several hundred
yards away, flattening the rapist in the process. The heroine is saved,
several other extraneous characters are disposed of, and the tornado passes
on, all in fewer words than it takes to write this article. Say what you
like about Jackie Collins, but it takes chutzpah to write that kind of scene
and hope to get away with it. Yet get away with it she does, and who can
quarrel with that?
Jilly Cooper seems positively amateurish by comparison. Her latest novel,
The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous, is set in the heart of the English
countryside and is a continuation of all the other Cooper novels that have
gone before. The hero this time is 22-year-old Lysander Hawkley, an achingly
handsome toyboy who passes the time as a polo-playing estate agent when not
bonking other men's wives.
So good is he at it - the bonking - that he decides to set up as a stud for
hire in the Rutshire village of Paradise. Before long women are queueing at
his door, gasping for a service while their husbands are away neglecting
them in London. All would be well, if it was not for the sinister presence
in the village of the world-famous conductor Rannaldini . . .
And, er, that's it. Not much of a plot, not much of a book either. The
author writes like Enid Blyton, which is a compliment of sorts, but one
cannot help feeling that the manuscript would have been thrown back at her
if it had come in on the slush pile. And if she was looking for a snappier
title she could have called it Bonkers, since that is what the book is all
about.
James Clavell's Gai-Jin is another of his oriental sagas, Japan this time,
during the upheavals of the 1860s. Foreigners are crowding in, the power of
the Shogun is waning, a group of young Samurai is intriguing to restore the
prestige of the Emperor. Against this backdrop, young Malcolm Struan of Hong
Kong's Noble House (he has switched countries for this book) falls deeply in
love with French newcomer Angelique, she of the maternal attributes so much
admired in paragraph one.
No good comes of it, of course. Angelique has a racy past and is not a
suitable match for a tai-pan. The story rattles along at breakneck speed,
with duels, beheadings, brothel scenes and great dollops of history and
Japanese culture all thrown in together. Old Clavell hands know what to
expect, and will not be disappointed.
All of which leaves poor old Roy Hattersley to bring up the rear. A pity
really, because Skylark's Song is easily the most literate of the four,
albeit lacking somewhat in pace and drive. It is the third in his Yorkshire
trilogy about his own family, and more particularly about Father Rex
Hattersley, a Catholic priest in the pit village of Shirebrook.
Rex is in love with beautiful Enid, and is prepared to leave the ministry to
marry her. But though she reciprocates, Enid marries a handsome Irishman
instead, and by a cruel twist of fate it falls to Rex to do the honours.
Even worse, he is then forced to sit in the confessional a few months later
and listen to his rival admitting to all sorts of sexual complications
through the grille.
Promising material, yet never fully exploited by the author. He tells the
story well enough, but lacks any real gift for drama or narrative tension.
Too often he falls back on quiet understatement and long passages of
explication, when what is needed is a big scene and a fierce interplay of
emotions. These people are flesh and blood after all, not just portraits on
the Hattersley family wall. One wants to be right there with them, rather
than just reading about it in a book afterwards.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Books: Renaissance man remembers - The curious double life
of Ernst Gombrich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LIFELONG INTEREST: CONVERSATIONS ON ART AND SCIENCE by EH Gombrich and
Didier Eribon Thames &amp; Hudson Pounds 14.95, 191 pages
THOSE who are familiar with the writings of Sir Ernst Gombrich, Professor
Emeritus in the University of London, will know that he favours two distinct
kinds of title for the collections of essays and lectures he has published
since he came to England in January 1936. Here are some examples of what may
be called Gombrich's binary title-form: Ideals and Idols, Norm and Form,
Means and Ends, Art and Illusion, The Image and the Eye. And here are some
of the other form, the purely descriptive: The Story of Art, The Sense of
Order, Meditations on a Hobby Horse, Topics of Our Time - to which must be
added the present book, A Lifelong Interest. The title this time refers to
his lifelong interest in art history.
It is the more descriptive titles that are usually given by Gombrich to the
collections of his papers that do not have a unifying theme but range over a
miscellaneous field of learned inquiry. If the Italian Renaissance is a
continuing interest of his, it co-exists with a host of others, from the art
of ancient Egypt to contemporary abstract painting, from the nature of
perception to the decline of general knowledge, from Goebbels to Malraux.
The present volume - a series of tape-recorded interviews with a French
journalist - is the most heterogeneous of them all. Didier Eribon, who has
done a similar book of conversations with Levi-Strauss, has elicited much
interesting diverse material from his interviewee. The exchanges start with
some biographical information, where Gombrich looks back upon his youth, and
then deal at length with many of the recurring preoccupations of his
writings. Questions that frequently crop up in his books such as how
'innocent' - innocent of pre-conditioning - is the eye that the spectator
brings to a painting, are addressed again here, and second thoughts are
sometimes voiced by this least bigoted of scholars.
He was born in 1909 in Vienna. Though his parents were of Jewish origin he
had the same classically-oriented general education as his gentile
contemporaries. Gombrich tries to deflate the myth of Vienna as 'the
birthplace of every modern movement', but he is soon forced to admit
reluctantly that 'the Vienna you read about in books' did have a
considerable influence on his formation. His mother knew Schoenberg, Mahler
and Freud, but even more important than that was the prevailing ambience,
the high regard paid by the Viennese middle-class to Bildung - culture in a
general sense.
His father - a lawyer - hardly bothered to oppose his youngest son's
declared aim of becoming an art historian even though he feared for his
chances of earning a livelihood. We are given vignettes of people like
Joseph Strzygowski and Julius von Schlosser, the rival professors of art
history in the city, and Ernst Kris, the psychoanalyst and curator of the
Hapsburg collection of goldsmith-work in the Vienna Museum. They were among
Gombrich's earliest mentors. It was from Kris that Gombrich learnt that art
history could be combined with other disciplines - hence the inclusion of
Science in the subtitle of this book - and with whom he wrote his first book
published in this country, Caricature (1940).
Gombrich's first ever book was published before the war in Vienna in 1935.
It was commissioned there by Walter Neurath (who founded Thames &amp; Hudson in
London) to be part of an educational series of books for children he was
editing. Gombrich's book was a History of the World; though written in only
six weeks it proved to be a great success. The following year Gombrich came
to London as a research assistant at the Warburg Institute to put into order
the books, manuscripts and papers of Aby Warburg; the Institute Warburg
founded had moved from Vienna to London in 1933 as the Nazis began to
encroach upon Austrian cultural life.
Gombrich inherited not only the founder's scholarly interest in the
Renaissance but also his sense of the range of knowledge (especially through
the acquisition of books in a variety of disciplines) required to understand
a period such as Florence under the Medicis. Then the second world war broke
out: Gombrich left the Institute to work in the BBC monitoring service. He
was approached for a book by another Viennese publisher now in London, Dr
Horovitz, the head of the Phaidon Press. Gombrich searched among his papers
and found the few chapters of a volume on Art he had begun to write as a
companion volume to the children's history. But it was not until the war was
over and he had returned to the Institute (by then a part of London
University) as a full member of its staff that he completed this book - The
Story of Art.
It was a best-seller on publication and it still sells steadily throughout
the world. The current edition, with a new chapter on photography, is the
15th. Its immediate effect on the author was to transform his life from that
of an obscure struggling academic in London into that of an internationally
known, much sought after authority of the museum and art worlds. He was
appointed Slade Professor of Fine Art at Oxford and invitations came from
Harvard, Washington and from many other centres of learning all over the
world.
'People know me' Gombrich tells his French interviewer 'as the author of The
Story of Art who have never heard of me as a scholar. On the other hand,
many of my colleagues have never read the book. They may have read my papers
on Poussin or Leonardo, but not that. It is a curious double life'. It may
be curious yet it remains one which he has fruitfully led for many years and
continues to lead to the enrichment of anyone who reads him in either
capacity.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Books: Brilliant, but flawed - The life of George Brown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIRED AND EMOTIONAL: THE LIFE OF LORD GEORGE BROWN by Peter Paterson Chatto
&amp; Windus Pounds 20, 308 pages
THERE WILL never be another George Brown; the system won't allow it. Today,
a boy from working class London would no longer leave school at 15, work his
way up through the trade movement, become deputy prime minister and foreign
secretary with a lasting record of achievement. He might go to university
(something that would have turned George Brown into a different man); he
would be less likely to go into union politics and he might not even
consider joining the Labour Party. One of the problems of the current party
is that many of its old aims - like greater equality of opportunity - have
been partially accomplished.
George Brown was special in another way, too. He was not the only working
class boy to make it almost to the top. Ernest Bevin had done it before him.
But Brown was a man who, despite his successes, continued to harbour
resentments. As Peter Paterson puts it in this new biography: 'He carried
enormous chips on both shoulders,' mostly against intellectuals and the
class system as he saw it.
At the same time, he was a 'character'. He got continually into scrapes.
Everyone knew who he was; no-one would have thought he was anything but
British - the very initials are almost a symbol. One of his very first acts
as a young minister was to have the Tower of London opened to the public on
Sundays. Politics became duller when he resigned for the last time.
He also had great imagination. He was pro-European from a very early age:
much more so than any of his contemporaries in the Labour Party - or among
the Tories, for that matter. In that sense he was a forerunner of Edward
Heath. He had an intuitive understanding of the Middle East which was rare
among British politicians. He did not share his party's prevalent belief in
Israeli supremacy: hence his negotiation of United Nations Resolution 242
when he became foreign secretary - it has remained the basis for Middle East
peace talks. Even his National Plan, when he ran the department of economic
affairs, still arouses nostalgia. If only the Wilson government had devalued
soon after it came to power in 1964, perhaps it would have been more viable.
Paterson's book reads less sympathetically than is perhaps intended. 'Tired
and emotional' became the words associated with George Brown, and indeed
with a particular form of behaviour in anyone, ever after. The author does
not spare the warts. Whereas a foreign office man would tell you that 'the
trouble with old George is that he only needs one glass of sherry for it to
go to his head', Paterson makes it clear that there was a heavy drinking
problem throughout. He also shows that Brown could be intolerable to his
wife, Sophie, whom he finally left for his secretary.
There were excuses, to be sure. Brown needed money, especially when on the
back benches. For a time he received payments from the Mirror Group, until
it came out as a scandal. The sums were small and recent events in European
socialist parties suggest that we should be tolerant to a man who was simply
trying to make ends meet.
Emphasising the troubles, however, can lead to understating the achievements
and the popular appeal. How hard Brown was to understand can be illustrated
by two statements. 'He is not only superficial and lightweight
intellectually; he is not only vain and vulgar; he is not only drunken; he
is also a little cad'. Then again: 'I found George the most attractive
member of cabinet, certainly the most gifted, certainly the most
imaginative, possessing a mind which has a sense for the evidence buried in
the documents or in a speech and which can smell it out.'
Both statements come from the same man, Richard Crossman, who went on to
identify the same problem as Paterson: namely chips. Aneurin Bevan had many
of the same positive qualities, but without Brown's detestation of
intellectuals. It would be interesting to learn more about how and why. It
is also not quite explained how a politician who Paterson claims scarcely
read a single book turned out to be so ahead of his fellows on foreign
policy.
The book has some lapses. It is hard to excuse the repeated use of Willi for
Willy Brandt. The man Brown appointed to the embassy in Bonn was Roger not
Robert Jackling. And Paterson must have a starry-eyed view of the home civil
service since he describes the foreign office as 'the stuffiest, most
conservative, and traditionally minded department of state.' At least the
foreign office is not insular; neither, despite all his character lapses,
was George Brown. 'Brilliant, but flawed' might be a better title.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Books: The changing shape of Jewish identity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSHUA SHERMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROOTS SCHMOOTS: JOURNEYS AMONG JEWS by Howard Jacobson Viking Pounds 16.99,
502 pages
PIETY AND POWER: THE WORLD OF JEWISH FUNDAMENTALISM by David Landau Secker &amp;
Warburg Pounds 20, 502 pages
RATIONALISTS and modernisers par excellence, secular Jews have observed with
varying degrees of puzzlement and dismay the growing influence of a
self-confident Jewish religious Right, unabashed in its strident
condemnation of secular humanism, assimilation to the larger society, and
such Enlightenment values as pluralism and democracy.
Each of these books is a partial response to the phenomenon of Jewish
religious revival, although Howard Jacobson would doubtless deny that was
what moved him, 'the least loyal, the least nostalgic of Jews' to embark at
this time on a 'Jewjewjourney' that he insists had no purpose other than
pursuing non-belonging, the confirmation of homelessness, of feeling alien.
Despite himself, he succeeds in this paradoxical enterprise, coming to no
significant conclusions about his Jewishness, experiencing no epiphany, yet
revealing along his uneasy trajectory from Stamford Hill to New York's 47th
Street, from Jerusalem to Lithuania, his quintessentially Jewish propensity
to remember past wrongs, argue with God, and feel superior to and often
infuriated by his fellow-Jews.
Jacobson's consistent pugnaciousness leads him into abrasive, sometimes
amusing encounters with representatives of the Chassidic community, hotel
staff almost everywhere, Americans of several varieties, but above all with
Israel itself, which he describes as 'not just a charity but a sort of
summer work-camp' and spiritual playground for American Jews. Unable to
forego an anecdote, sometimes of doubtful relevance to his main theme,
Jacobson can be wryly funny, always loudly dissatisfied, angry with 'the
snarling God' of the Jews and with the Orthodox guardians of tradition.
To his surprise, Jacobson is nonetheless touched by the warmth of worship in
a gay synagogue in Los Angeles; and admits that amid the overgrown stones of
the Jewish cemetery in Serhai, the little Lithuanian town from which his
grandfather fled to England, he feels both 'upset' and somehow linked to his
ancestors. When the knockabout humour stops, Jacobson seems rather sad in
his evident inability to fathom what being Jewish now actually means to him:
his Jewish identity, remote from the texts and rituals that sustained the
tradition over millennia, amounts to gastronomic memories, a few fragments
of Yiddish, a general restlessness; the grand Jewish prophetic passion to
repair the world has on the evidence of Roots Scmoots been diluted to mere
tetchiness.
David Landau, for his part, describes in occasionally numbing detail the
lives and practices of the faithful adherents to the Law, those Orthodox
zealots who consider themselves the only real Jews left, numbering perhaps
650,000 among the approximately 13m Jews in the world. This highly visible
minority within a minority has, thanks to its fecundity and aggressive
militancy, won a pivotal role in Israeli politics, aligning its adherents
with the political far Right there and in the Diaspora, and even forging
mutually advantageous alliances with fundamentalist Christian groups in
several countries. Although the requirements of Jewish law are regarded by
these Jews as immutable, they are in fact adopting ever-stricter
observances, especially in Western countries, thus further distancing
themselves from assimilated Jews and contributing to what Landau sees as the
strong possibility of an outright schism in the Jewish world.
Moreover, the birth-rate among the ultra-Orthodox is much higher than among
other Jews: in their international yet close-knit community, seven or eight
children are usual, and the mere two-child family considered a pitiable sign
of dysfunction. Their strict ritual, deliberately anachronistic speech and
dress, absolute insistence on apartness, are tinged with dislike and
contempt for other Jews, let alone non-Jews; yet even so militant a
Socialist and secularist as David Ben Gurion failed, with fateful long-term
consequences, to challenge their claim to impose Orthodox norms on the State
of Israel concerning Sabbath observance, dietary laws and, more painfully,
marriage and divorce.
Landau points out that the ultra-Orthodox in Israel live largely on charity,
their children ostentatiously exempt from military service, their attachment
to the State and its institutions lukewarm at best, arousing often bitter
hostility among the secular majority of Israelis toward what they regard as
the intolerant, anti-democratic parasites in their midst. Despite their
growing anger, secular Jews hesitate to raise a hand against bearded
patriarchal figures in the kaftans and fur hats of another age: the wearers
of those distinguishing marks take full advantage of these remnants of
traditional piety among the non-observant.
Landau too, though amply describing Orthodox intransigence, obscurantism,
power politics and corruption, is unable quite to condemn them, suggesting
in a rather lame conclusion that dismissing them as anachronistic may be
inappropriate. For their part, the Orthodox, like their fundamentalist
colleagues in Christianity and Islam, entertain no doubts whatsoever: they
are convinced that they and their 'Torah-true' descendants will remain the
only authentic bearers of the tradition long after Jews such as the authors
of these books have vanished into the general Godless population.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Special Report on Clocks, Watches and Jewellery: Gems glow
amid the gloom - Antique Jewellery / Private buyers can still find bargains
 -if they look beyond the hype
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIENNE BECKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS ALL over the world are still the strongest buyers of jewels and gems
at auction, but one of the most distinctive characteristics of the antique
jewellery market is the increasing number of private buyers in the
salerooms. Period jewellery has been one of the most stable and steadily
growing areas of the decorative arts in the last ten years. As the art
market crumbled, jewels continued to glow in the economic gloom, thanks in
part to these 'privates' who head regularly for the auction action in search
of value for money and the opportunity to buy at 'trade' prices.
The auction houses have encouraged this trend by organising big sales and
producing more informative and temptingly glossy catalogues, with
confidence-inspiring essays, footnotes and provenances.
But, some might say, where does good background information end and saleroom
hype begin?
Since quality, authenticity and strong style count more than ever - whether
rich Renaissance, designer Deco or even soulful Sixties - it is more
important for customers to understand what they are buying, to distinguish
the very best from the ordinary, to take expert advice and not to be blinded
by hype.
In the long run, the best 'bargains' are usually those fine and rare items
that cost a substantial amount of money. However, 'cult' or 'personality'
sales of pieces once owned by, say, the Duchess of Windsor, Elton John or
Diana Dors can add an inflated premium to goods which may not be able to
sustain their high prices second time around on the market.
Limited supplies of the right goods have also kept prices buoyant, and at
the same time connoisseurs have become more knowledgeable and
discriminating. Contrary to general belief, newly impoverished owners are
not selling their treasures; they sell run-of-the-mill goods to pay the
bills. When the best examples make it on to the counter or into the shop
window; they are snapped up by the trade.
Salerooms attract a lot of the fine jewels on the market. They also provide
excitement, entertainment and the ideal place to see, handle and learn about
jewellery. However, dealers will still pay good prices, in or out of the
salerooms, for desirable merchandise. That elusive bargain is now more than
likely to be lurking on London's Bond Street.
In spite of recent adverse publicity, period diamond jewels are the best
sellers, but the price has to be right and the quality and style good.
Eighteenth century diamond jewellery is still somewhat undervalued, although
in March at Sotheby's sale of 'Jewels for the Collector' a simple but
stunning pair of 18th century drop earrings, thought in the trade to be
worth around Pounds 15,000, fetched Pounds 52,100 as two private buyers
battled it out. So much for trade prices.
Here wearability and fashion content come into play. Decorative, stylish
earrings of all ages are much sought-after; chokers are back in style again,
bows always sell well. At Sotheby's, again in March, fashion-followers
plumped for 1970s style rainbow bead necklaces.
Last October, the success of the Charsky collection of antique jewellery at
Christie's highlighted not only the eagerness for fresh goods but also the
unbeatable, wearable charm and craftsmanship of early 19th century
sentimental jewellery, layered with symbols and motifs, intricately worked
in coloured gold and shy gemstones.
Last December Sandra Cronan of Burlington Arcade held a successful
exhibition of cufflinks, desirable because of their style and usefulness
and, because of their small size, relatively reasonable prices. Tiaras,
however beautiful, have to be versatile and earn their keep as necklaces
too, to realise strong prices. Even among High Victorian gold and gemset
jewellery interesting earrings are hard to find and easy to sell. They are
also subject to reproduction.
Signatures still count for a great deal, from the 19th century revivalists,
such as Giuliano and Castellani, especially rare today, through the
ever-popular Cartier and Tiffany to 1950s stars such as Sterle, Verdura,
Schlumberger. Bulgari is synonymous with quality and chic and even pieces
from the 1960s and 1970s have cachet. But since Christie's Geneva specialist
Cartier sale last May (to be repeated this May) there are signs that buyers
are carefully distinguishing between good and average examples of any one
maker and no longer simply buying a name.
Overall, it is a realistic and selective market, with anything rare, fine
and historically important and stylish selling at strong prices whether at
the Pounds 500 or Pounds 50,000 level. Less spectacular jewels, if pretty
and fashionable, sell at just the right price. This sorting out could be one
of the benefits of the recession, for as David Callaghan, of Hancocks
London, says: 'When the recession ends, what we are worried about is average
things fetching inflated prices.'

FT  08 MAY 93 / Special Report on Clocks, Watches and Jewellery: Fashion
talismans for the new age - Costume Jewellery / The changing face of 'fakes'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIENNE BECKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW THAT costume jewellery is here to stay as a respectable, if not
essential, accessory, it is taking on more gravitas as an art form and
finding a new look for the 'natural nineties'. Art and fashion in jewellery
are converging. At the same time, the demarcation between costume jewellery
and real jewellery is fading.
The 1980s status symbol gilt and glitter couture jewellery is being replaced
by dreamier, talismanic trinkets with more value - whether intrinsic,
artistic or ritualistic - as women search for more 'meaningful' jewellery.
Designers and jewellers are mixing materials and crossing barriers between
real and fake with new abandon.
A whole middle range of decorative, semi-precious jewellery is springing up
from individual designers such as Solange Azagury-Partridge, who works with
massive crystals and upside-down stones set in gold-plated silver, and Dinny
Hall, the golden girl of 1980s fashion jewellery who now works to commission
and sells gold-plated silver ranges rather than way out costume jewellery in
her shop in Westbourne Grove, London.
Part of this new seriousness comes from a recent re-evaluation of 20th
century costume jewellery which has turned into a promising collecting area.
Christie's South Kensington auction house now holds regular sales of
designer costume jewellery and several London shops, including Cobra &amp;
Bellamy, Van Peterson and Steinberg &amp; Tolkien, specialise in period jewels
from the 1920s to the 1960s, particularly the sought-after American makers
such as Miriam Haskell, Trifari, Marcel Boucher and vintage Kenneth Jay Lane
from the 1960s and 1970s.
This field works like the antique jewellery market: the most desirable
pieces, reaching prices in the hundreds, even thousands of pounds, are those
that have ben finely made by big names and beautifully conceived to capture
the mood and fashion of their age, whether it is the Cartier look by Alfred
Philippe, chief designer at Trifari, the glorious sophistication of the
1950s creations by Boucher, or the American Schiaparelli fantasy jewellery
made of smouldering, luminous crystal rocks.
Above all, costume jewellery is no longer junk jewellery. Carol Lister of
Liberty in London says that although costume jewellery went through a
decidedly dull patch, it is now waking up to the new age. Kate Renwick,
buying controller for fashion accessories at Harvey Nichols, finds that
women are buying more jewellery than ever but now prefer a more refined look
to reflect their new mood of dressing in the 90s. 'Jewellery is such a
personal, whimsical purchase that brand or designer labels always come
second,' she says.
In tune with the 1970s fashion revival, there is more than a trace of
arty-craftiness about today's costume jewellery that is not untouched by the
grisly hand of Grunge - such as long, stringy bead necklaces and pendants
and crosses in softly burnished silver or pewter-coloured metal, with
amethysts, turquoise, coral, and jewels replicating natural materials or
using the real thing.
The new, slick Armani range cashes in on naturalism, using imitation
tortoiseshell, jet, mother-of-pearl and ivory, while John Bowman's
ecologically sound jewels, sold at Liberty, are sensitive one-off creations
of Baltic amber mounted on silver or occasionally on gold and hung on
twisted silk or macrame braid. His prices range from about Pounds 150
upwards.
Robert Lee Morris is an artist-jeweller who successfully translated his
themes and inspirations into popular, fashionable costume jewellery, and his
shapes and forms have always been based on organic forms or tribal emblems
and weapons like the dart. His brand of fluid simplicity is still perfect
for today's look.
Other makers are using fossils, pebbles and shell shapes and soft, natural
motifs. The talented Pellini has also long copied natural materials with her
brilliant, tactile resins and synthetics. Eric Beamon, now known as Erickson
Beamon, is scaling and toning everything down. His jewels are smaller and
more intricate, using tiny beads and cameos. Necklaces are either very long
and 'hippie' or old-fashioned chokers.
And finally, wave goodbye to your power earrings. Put them in a shoebox
until they turn into antiques. The new natural earrings are - believe it or
not - small and discreet.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Special Report on Clocks, Watches and Jewellery: Classics
still dominate - Antique Clocks and Watches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GARNIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PAST year started as a frustrating one in the market for second-hand
clocks and watches, governed as it by a long wait for an upturn. More
recently there have been traces of a silver lining - in the shape of an
overhaul of international exchange rates following Black (or White?)
Wednesday.
Since then the mood has been distinctly more upbeat for the first time since
the dizzy heights of late 1989/early 1990. The big names - Patek Philippe,
Rolex, Vacheron &amp; Constantin, Audemars Piguet, Lange, Breguet and Cartier -
still dominate the field, with the most sought-after models being the
complicated and technical models.
Cartier watches were feared to have peaked a year ago but this has proved
not to be the case. A pre-war Driver watch, curved to the wrist for easier
reading at the wheel, sold for Pounds 52,000 at Sotheby's Geneva in
November, and a very rare eight-day watch sold for SFr170,000 (Pounds
75,000) as against a previous high of Dollars 98,000 (Pounds 63,630)
Patek Philippe, commonly seen as the most 'blue chip' brand, has suffered
recently from choosy collectors and its performance at auction remains
patchy. Rectangular models are now back in fashion while square ones are
still difficult to sell, but round models of particular complexity are
making big prices.
Standard Patek perpetual calendars in gold cases currently sell for about
Pounds 18,000 compared with Pounds 20,000 in 1989/90. Their Officer's watch,
brought out in 1989 to celebrate their 150th anniversary, was sold in one
instance in January 1990 for Pounds 19,800; now it commonly makes Pounds
8,000 to Pounds 10,000 but this is still way above the original retail price
of Pounds 4,700.
Such premiums are a much rarer thing than they were although the Rolex
Daytona Cosmograph Chronograph models and older, Rolex chronographs and
vintage bubble-backs continue to be sought after.
The Swatch, the ugly duckling of the collector's wristwatch market, is no
longer a swan and indeed is now flying lower than before. No one has or is
planning to hold a specialised sale or even a themed section in a sale this
year. Only those in absolutely 'as new' condition and early 1983/4
prototypes seem sought-after.
Ruth Zandberg of Christie's Geneva says new collectors are looking for
'early (pre 1700) watches' and Antiquorum has had some good results in this
field.
Sotheby's London enthuses about an exceptionally small clock watch of c1620
that automatically strikes the hours in passing; estimated at Pounds 80,000
in their forthcoming Harcourt sale. Prettily enamelled, it also has that
essential extra ingredient - a bit of history - as it was given by Elizabeth
of Bohemia, Charles I's tragic daughter better known as the Winter Queen.
The antique clock market seems to have been playing a waiting game at the
top end, while seemingly recession proof and quite active in lower ranges.
Rumours are that some high-flying clocks should sell well this summer and if
so this could flush more out on to the market.
More and more activity these days takes place at antique fairs, which has
enabled the public to look and buy at leisure and introduced new customers
to individual dealers. London's well-established Grosvenor House (June 9-19)
and Olympia Fine Art and Antique Fair (June 3-13) now in its 20th
anniversary year, as well as the new British Antique Dealers Fair at the
Duke of York's Headquarters (May 5-11) will have good horological showings.
Clocks and watches can be a particularly fraught subject for the amateur
sales-room hunter as goods at auction are sold 'as found'. Buying from a
reputable dealer offers the reassurance of properly restored and overhauled
pieces guaranteed under the Trades Descriptions Act.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Special Report on Clocks, Watches and Jewellery: Why quartz
came in the nick of time - Quality Watches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GARNIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEN YEARS ago, few would have believed that the onslaught of the quartz
watch would be the salvation of the mechanical movement.
By that I mean the mechanical watch at the highest level: technically
brilliant and loaded with complicated indications on the dial. Those who
appreciate - and can afford - the finest watches are alienated by the
mass-produced nature of quartz and prefer the hand-finished product of the
traditional mechanical movement. Push that to the limits of the watchmaker's
technical ability, with as many as 700 parts in a watch, and you have a
refined market of low-number production pieces of irresistible appeal to the
collector.
Such complicated pieces take a long time to make: Time Products,
distributors of Audemars Piguet, are still awaiting delivery of some orders
they took at the Basle Fair in April 1992. However, the UK is comparatively
well served: of the five examples of Audemars' Pounds 240,800 Triple
Complication watch made last year, two were consigned to London - not bad in
a world market deemed dominated by the Japanese, Italians and Americans.
The annual Basle watch and jewellery fair in April is the industry's
showcase, at which Audemars this year seem to have received the most acclaim
from retailers for what is described as a stunning new collection of diamond
and coloured stone-set ladies watches.
Blancpain has just launched an adaptable ladies' watch with interchangeable
stone-set or plain bezels and coloured straps to match. Rene Boivin, the
Paris-based firm, too, has turned its attention to ladies' watches. The
Chrysallis case has sliding sections which either reveal or conceal stone
settings, providing a dual purpose watch for evening or day wear.
Another watch house of Parisian origin but using the best of modern Swiss
watch technology is Breguet, originally founded by a watchmaker of genius
over 200 years ago. Until recently linked to the troubled Parisian jewellery
house of Chaumet, its new owner since 1987, the Arab-financed Investcorp,
has separated the two companies and is preparing a floatation of Breguet on
the Paris stock market.
Unlike a quartz watch, a mechanical movement and escapement will keep a
slightly different 'rate' depending on what position it is held in, for
example face-up or face-down. To compensate for this Breguet invented in the
1790s the tourbillon, or revolving escapement carriage, a device eminently
suited to wristwatches, which are waved about far more than a pocket watch.
In spite of being devilishly difficult to fit within a wristwatch case, a
tourbillon is becoming the sine qua non for the retail collectors' market.
Vacheron &amp; Constantin is planning a matching pair, in emeralds and rubies,
of tourbillon pocket watches using the last of the movements it has of its
1954 production. For next year Jaeger-LeCoultre plans a limited edition of
'Reverso' tourbillon watches in pink gold, of which 15 are promised for the
UK.
Garrard's 150th anniversary as Crown Jewellers is being marked by a limited
edition of 150 Patek Philippe watches in pink gold with crystal back
revealing the self-winding movement, to sell at Pounds 7,950. While Patek
intends this to be the last watch to be made by them for a particular
retailer, it has been looking at its own range and has identified a gap
between its Pounds 7,000 automatic calendar watch and the top of the range
perpetual calendar wristwatch at around Pounds 28,000. The company is now
planning an intermediate model.
It is typical of the Swiss watch industry that while some companies, such as
Blancpain, have been bought by large concerns (in this instance SMH, the
makers of Omega) no company has actually gone under. The clue to this
survival rate is based on buoyant sales for top-quality watches. So popular,
for example, are Rolex's macho productions, in particular the Submariner and
Daytona models, that demand constantly exceeds supply.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Special Report on Clocks, Watches and Jewellery: Rugged and
so fashionable - Sports Watches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GOODALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPORTS WATCHES are today's fashion accessories and those who use them can be
divided neatly into two categories: those who wear them for their cachet and
those who are serious about their sport and want the watch most appropriate
to it.
Fashion-conscious wearers put a high priority on style. The watch must bear
the brand name that will impress the right people and, almost incidentally,
be ready for action should it encounter anything deeper than a champagne
bucket. The sports enthusiast will put reliability and ruggedness at the top
of the list.
A few watches pass muster on both counts.
In the last few years, one established company has forged ahead of the
competition in this market and is considered by many to be the sports watch
 -TAG-Heuer. It is certainly a fashionable brand but, above all, it is a
serious sports watch.
As timekeepers to Formula 1 motor racing - and a sister company to the
McLaren racing team - TAG-Heuer is actively involved in sport and has grown
to become the sixth largest Swiss watch maker, in terms of sales value. Its
6000 range, which reached the shops towards the end of last year, is already
in great demand, achieving cult status in certain markets - and especially
the UK.
Also in the serious but fashionable league is Breitling - a Swiss company
established in 1844. It makes watches that appeal to air and sea
professionals, as well as providing frequent travellers with a timekeeping
device that offers three time zones at a glance on the Antares World model,
which has a non-magnetic steel case designed to withstand great depths. It
costs Pounds 1155.
Chopard is a name that some associate with jewellery and watch designs with
moving diamonds, but this innovative company takes sports watches seriously.
It is the sponsor of, and competitor in, the Mille Miglia vintage car rally
in Italy and produces a selection of sports chronographs, including the 1000
Miglia. Prices are from Pounds 545 in steel to around Pounds 5,000 in 18ct
gold.
Another timepiece of interest to car enthusiasts, as well as those who
prefer to walk, is the Porsche Design compass watch, made by IWC. The
light-weight titanium-cased watch hinges to reveal a compass. The bracelet
can easily be detached so that the 5mm wide links can be used as a measure
on a map.
The Altiland, by Revue Thommen, has a steel case and is water-resistant to
30 metres. It incorporates a mechanical altimeter and a barometric scale, as
well as an oil-mounted compass that is also water resistant. The same
company also makes a watch for golfers, called the Greenmark.
To the sailing fraternity Corum is the most desirable watch. This year it is
introducing a new model with three off-centre dials that show tidal
movements, moon phases and high and low tides, water levels and next tides.
It also features a calendar. It has a self-winding mechanical movement and
has been tested by the French Navy's Hydrographic and Marine Department.
This is a serious watch for seafarers and will be available in a steel and
18ct gold case with a leather strap or steel and gold bracelet. It is water
resistant to a depth of 100m and costs Pounds 3815.
Omega is one of many companies producing divers' watches, but its latest
model is rather special. The Seamaster Professional Chrono Diver, should be
in the shops later this year and has a chronometer, is water resistant to
120 metres, and made in men's and women's sizes.
Two of the major Japanese manufacturers, Seiko and Citizen, cater for divers
with watches designed to make diving safer.
Another respected manufacturer, widely used by sportsmen, is Zenith. Its
Rainbow collection with a remarkable self-winding mechanical chronograph
movement is another that must be considered seriously. These cost from
Pounds 799 in steel to Pounds 8949 in gold.
Sector, a company which sponsors sportsmen and women in some of the most
hair-raising sports such as base jumping and free diving. Prices from Pounds
115 to Pounds 600.
Another brand in this category is Ellesse, a designer brand in the tennis
world. Ellesse make sports watches for men and women. Prices are from Pounds
55 for fun designs up to Pounds 295 for bracelet models with
water-resistance.
Gucci also makes a sports watch, the 9700, that is water resistant to 100
metres.
Higher up the price spectrum, is the Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso, designed more

FT  08 MAY 93 / Travel: How to play the waiting game - Practical Traveller,
Cancelled flights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING

<TEXT>
ONE does not know whether to rant. Perhaps raving would be more appropriate.
Most of us just sit resignedly in the bar, whiling away the hours with an
over-priced beer. But what rights do we really have when a flight is
delayed, cancelled or rerouted?
Our chances of sympathetic treatment, according to the Air Transport Users
Committee, depends mainly on the airline, the type of ticket held and the
nature of the delay. As a rule of thumb, it says, airlines tend to reflect
the standards of customer service in the country of origin.
According to the AUC, passengers are in the best position in cases of
'denied boarding.' Nearly all airlines sell more tickets for a flight than
they have seats, because a certain percentage of passengers consistently
fails to show up. But delicate calculations sometimes go awry, leaving
anxious passengers jostling for limited seats.
Those denied boarding for flights originating in the EC have European
legislation on their side. Carriers are obliged to offer the choice between
a full refund or an alternative flight. In addition, you are entitled to
cash compensation of Ecu150 (Pounds 120) for journeys up to 3,500kms, and of
Ecu300 for longer flights. Compensation may be reduced if you reach your
destination with minimal delay, defined as two hours for short-haul flights
and four for long-haul.
Passengers (like criminal suspects) are also entitled to make a phone call
(or send a fax), and to meals and a hotel room where necessary. Airlines may
offer their own vouchers in lieu of cash, but you are not obliged to accept
them.
If the flight does not originate in Europe (this includes return legs) then
EC legislation will not apply. Most airlines fill the aircraft by upgrading
passengers to first or business class, usually selecting smartly-dressed
customers holding full-fare economy tickets.
Check-in staff will then seek volunteers willing to be 'bumped' off the
flight in return for vouchers. These are redeemable for tickets on the same
carrier. American Airlines, for example, offers those bumped off
transatlantic flights anything from Dollars 400 (Pounds 259.70) to Dollars
1,000 worth of vouchers.
In the case of long delays or outright cancellation, says the AUC, 'rough
justice', not EC legislation, prevails. The passenger, in effect, has 'no
rights at all.'
The thinking is that it would be unwise to compel airlines to pay
compensation for delays caused by technical faults, since to do so would
create commercial pressures to fly unsafe aircraft. In the case of bad
weather or air-traffic-control difficulties, it is deemed unfair to punish
the airline for circumstances beyond its control.
Thankfully, most airlines have a reputation to protect. If flights are
delayed, they will usually provide refreshments and, when necessary,
accommodation.
In the case of outright cancellations, you should seek to have your ticket
endorsed by other carriers. Some airlines are very good at this, but there
is a pecking order. First-class, business and full-fare economy passengers
are looked after first, with bucket-shop ticket-holders relegated to the
bottom of the pile. Missed connections involving more than one airline are
the greyest area, the danger being that the stranded passenger falls between
two stools. Your best bet is to harry the first carrier. If you have
incurred extra expenses because of missing your onward flight, send them the
bill.
It is difficult to insure against relatively short delays. Many policies
only pay out for a wait of longer than 12 hours. If you want to be covered
for less drastic circumstances, consult the fine print.
Complaints are best pursued directly with the airline concerned. If matters
are not resolved satisfactorily send relevant documentation and an
explanatory letter to Clare Tallboys, Consumer Affairs Adviser, Air
Transport Users Committee, 2nd Floor, Kingsway House, 103 Kingsway, London
WC2B 6QX. The AUC is not a statutory body but will help take up your case.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Travel: A horse and cart journey through old Transylvania -
Nick Haslam eats goats' cheese and listens to fireside tales in the
Carpathian mountains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK HASLAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIFTY YEARS ago, Romania was known as the little Switzerland of the Balkans.
Standing high in the Carpathians on the fringes of Transylvania, looking
down on to Lake Bicaz, it was easy to see why. Towering 2,000-metre peaks
folded into a blue distant horizon; below, the lake snaked indigo through
dark green pines.
We were a small group of five, travelling through the high wooded valleys of
Transylvania by horse and cart or minibus and staying overnight in peasant
houses. Our Romanian guides, Mirca and Marius, had long dreamt of having
their own business, and we were the first group to pioneer their new green
tourism.
We spent the first two days visiting Orthodox monasteries on the borders of
Moldova. With white painted walls, and cloisters lined with flowers, they
lay in clearings at the end of unmade roads like hidden jewels. It seemed
the perfect way to arrive by horse and cart after three hours of silent
trotting over pine needles through the woods.
At one small 16th century timber church, a bearded monk in black showed us a
medieval wall painting of the devil, a fearsome figure that stared from a
hidden alcove in the narrow apse. The church was, he proudly assured us,
wired for theft, and proceeded to demonstrate by lifting an icon from the
wall to reveal the hidden alarm. It had been fitted by the security forces
during the Ceausescu era, he said, but then added that the church had been
robbed of its most precious artefact a year before, during a power cut.
Our route during the 10 days lay along the 'Border of a Thousand Years', the
former frontier of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. On the fourth day we climbed
one of the high peaks, Mount Ocolusul Mare, and were admiring the view from
the summit when a sudden summer storm engulfed the hillside.
We scrambled for cover in a barn standing above steep pasture. Pebble-sized
hailstones clattered on to the roof and we found that we were not alone.
Propped on their scythes, a group of hay-cutters regarded us with some
curiousity. With Mirca as translator, I told them how beautiful I thought
the country was.
This brought a slight ripple of mirth, and one of them said something in
Hungarian. 'Yes, it is beautiful', translated Mirca, 'but she says that town
life is much more beautiful, for you don't have to work so hard and that
Hungary is far away.' Nearly 2m Hungarians, Europe's largest ethnic
minority, still live in Transylvania, ceded to Romania in 1921.
The villages of high Transylvania are living museums to a peasant existence
that disappeared over 50 years ago in western Europe. Black timber houses
surrounded by barns and lush paddocks run along the simple unmade roads,
punctuated by groups of ducks and a sleeping pig. At night, the silence is
absolute, save for the occasional jingle and clatter of a passing horse and
cart. Few cars or lorries come this far; electricity is a long-awaited
luxury.
Each night we stayed in a different village along our route, eating copious
meals by oil light, and talking with our hosts, some of whom had never met
westerners before. They told us that life was getting better now that the
old regime had gone, but that coping with privatisation was a problem.
Previously, large co-operatives had supplied tractors to work the land, but
now farmers were forced to plough with horses; the cost of a day's tractor
hire (about Pounds 40) was equivalent to one month's salary for a farm
labourer.
Their hospitality was extraordinary. We feasted on chicken and polenta, or
pork washed down with tuica, a strong spirit distilled from plums or
apricots.
Towards the end of the trip we camped one night high in the mountains.
Mirca, a veteran boy scout, wanted us to experience the true solitude of the
Carpathians. A cold wind blew down from the tops, and we lit a blazing fire
of pine branches. Attracted by the flames, a herdsman came to join us,
bringing some fresh goat cheese and a bottle of tuica. He told us that he
lived in the mountains throughout the summer, tending his cattle on the high
pasture. He had, he said, lost a cow the night before and Marius looked
uneasy as he translated that it had been eaten by a bear.
The herdsman told us that this area had been one of Ceausescu's favourite
hunting spots. Hunters would locate the largest bear and feed it regularly
at the same spot within metres of a specially-built hunting hide. The Great
Leader, a notoriously bad shot, would arrive 30 minutes before feeding time
by helicopter, blast the bear at close range from the security of the hide,
pose for a photograph and then disappear back to Bucharest.
However, on one occasion, the bear failed to arrive on time. A trembling
Securitate man, fearing for his life, had located a travelling circus nearby
and borrowed its performing bear, which he released within smelling distance
of the bait. Miraculously surviving the fusillade from the hide, the bear
took cover. The herdsman paused and then said with a twinkle: 'Do you know
what happened next? It leapt on to the Securitate man's bike and pedalled
for its life.' We all laughed, but I noticed that night that the food was
carefully placed a long distance from the tents.
On our last day we boarded the train at the old Saxon town of Brasov, and
travelled down to Bucharest, leaving the mountains for the simmering heat of
the plains. The train stopped at a village, and there was a knock soon after
at the compartment door. An astonishingly beautiful gipsy girl held out a
basket brimming with small paper cones of freshly-picked raspberries.
As I bought some her chestnut hair fell forward, carrying a strong aura of
woodsmoke. It was only with the greatest of difficulty that I stopped myself
from sweeping her off her feet, abandoning the train and hijacking the
nearest cart to return to the mountains.
Nick Haslam flew to Bucharest c/o Friendly Travel, which specialises in
travel to Romania. Address: Research House, Fraser Road, Perivale, Middlesex
UB6 7AQ, tel: 081-566-9040. Return flights from Heathrow to Bucharest start

Oddbins has followed up its successful policy of selling small lots of
cask-strength malt whiskies. The latest are a Scapa 1983, from the least
well-known of Orkney's two working distilleries (Pounds 19.99); Brora 1972,
from a now-closed distillery in the Highlands (Pounds 29.99); Springbank
1973, from Campbeltown (Pounds 29.99); and Ardbeg 1978 from Islay (Pounds
29.99). The Scapa is predictably light; the Brora exceptional; the
Springbank marred slightly by a too-obvious Bourbon cask note; and the
Ardbeg, with its peaty Islay reek, very worthy.
Oddbins, incidentally, has pulled off a considerable coup in introducing
Islay spring water (79p for 75cls) to its range. This authentically brown,
peaty Islay water provides an authentic counterpoint to your best malts.
The sherry house of Gonzalez Byass has released two sherries known
previously only on the Spanish market. These are their ManzaniIIa El Rociol
(cPounds 6.49) and their super-sweet Pedro Ximenez dessert wine Noe (cPounds
18.59). The former is a fine Manzanilla - essentially, a dry fino aged by
the sea to give it a salty tang. The 25-year-old Noe', with 450 grams of
unfermented sugar per litre, is said to be wonderful with ice cream. For
stockists, call 071-491-0623.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Food &amp; Drink: It is bargain time in the wine market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S first National Wine Week, which begins on Monday, was conceived in
October 1991 when you could still say 'Calais' to a British wine merchant
without putting up his blood pressure. Now, this seven-day feast of in-store
tastings, discounts and the like must seem a better idea than ever -
especially for retailers trying to compete with trippers who, since January
1, have been able to return from France with almost unlimited quantities of
negligibly-taxed wine.
It is too early to quantify the effect on the British wine trade of the
recent increases in personal duty-free allowances, but there is no doubt the
system is being abused widely; witness the squad of 150 excise verification
officers just set up by HM Customs and Excise. Its job is to catch people
such as the man who tried to sell crates of duty-free beer in the car park
of the Wine Society at Stevenage, Hertfordshire.
Last year was the British wine trade's best in terms of the volume released
from bond into commercial channels: 682m litres (or 909m bottles), a healthy
2.7 per cent more than in 1991 when it had looked as though the UK market,
which had grown consistently since a small hiccup in 1977, finally was
running out of steam.
British buyers, however, have been trading down quite noticeably. The
average spend per bottle is barely Pounds 3, the two most popular wines
being Liebfraumilch and white Lambrusco on which no retailer can depend for
profit.
But if times are tough for the typical UK merchant (who is, nowadays,
probably a woman working in the buying department of a supermarket), they
are considerably more difficult for producers. Increasing competition as
global consumption falls has put severe pressure on prices while demanding
ever more expensive investment. In the short term, this is great news for
consumers, but it will undoubtedly have some serious effects on supply in
the medium term.
Profit while ye may, therefore, from the bargains which are more evident
than ever in Britain this week (even if some are available from specialists
barely aware of National Wine Week's existence). Here are some of the best
buys; but most chains and supermarkets are doing something, and discounts on
all sorts of sparkling wine abound.
Conversion: Thresher has had the clever idea of trying to turn beer drinkers
on to wine. Buy any four of the brews made by its parent, Whitbread, to get
75p off a bottle of wine.
Degustation: Tesco promises 'the world's biggest tasting' at which more than
10,000 bottles will be opened in its best 200 (of 401) stores. Monday is
Germany, Tuesday Italy, Wednesday Iberia, Thursday France, and Friday and
Saturday New World - which is a fair indication of Tesco's enthusiasms.
Champenisation: Majestic and Oddbins are discounting in furious competition
on champagne. Next week, for example, Majestic has Ayala at Pounds 11.99 -
13 bottles for the price of 12 selected champagnes - and a major tasting
next weekend in all stores.
Throughout May, Oddbins can supply Heidsieck Dry Monopole by the case at
Pounds 11.54 a bottle. But its best buys are Laurent Perrier at Pounds 14.02
(if bought by the case) and Billecart-Salmon at Pounds 14.56 if you buy
seven bottles (for the price of six).
Best value in another sense, though, is Fluteau champagne on the wine list
of the Beauchamp Place Restaurant, London SW3, for just Pounds 19.75. And
Haynes, Hanson &amp; Clark, of London W8 and SW6, has a couple of equally
delicious growers' champagnes retailing in the Pounds 16-18 range.
Reduction: Safeway has made it a Wine Month, during which the exceptional
Portuguese red Leziria is back to Pounds 1.99 and the chain's vibrant new
Young Vatted Merlot 1992 from Bulgaria is just Pounds 2.29 until May 29.
Sophistication: Farr Vintners, of London SW1 (071-828 1960, fax 3500), has
the contents of three quite exceptional cellars to sell. Serious collectors
are unlikely to have another chance to pick from 15 cases of well-stored
1928 clarets; full cases of 1945 first growths; DRC wines aplenty; Yquem
from 30 vintages; and much, much more.
Reid Wines, of Hallatrow (0761-452 645, fax 453 642), is selling a more
modest but useful cellarful of mature burgundy and Barolo, and some
interesting claret, at fair prices.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Yum yum, chop chop, busy busy - The authentic
street food of Bangkok
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN HOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THAILAND the standing joke is that in Bangkok people eat only one meal a
day: it starts at 8 am and ends at 8 pm. Thai food is so beguiling to the
palate. The cuisine is an amalgamation mainly of southern Chinese and Indian
influences, with a dash of inspiration from Indonesia, Portugal and France.
The resulting hot and spicy, subtle and distinctive blend is pure Thai.
Under the expert tutelage of Charlie Arnatyakul, a leading Thai food
authority, I have experienced the broad spectrum of marvellous foods
available in the street and market stalls.
Nowhere in the world are street foods a more important part of peoples'
lives than in Bangkok. The crowded streets, narrow alleys and shops bustle
with pedestrians, pushcart vendors and hawkers of all sorts of goods but
roughly every fifth stall sells some ready-to-eat treat.
Among the most popular are Bow Mun Gai (Steamed Capon and Rice), Pad Se iew
(Stir-fried noodles in soy sauce with meat and vegetables), Pad Tliai
(Stir-fried rice noodles with tofu and chillies). Sauces play an important
role too.
The main ingredients that are most often used include garlic, Chinese
chives, fish sauce, spring onion, ginger, soy sauce and pickled preserved
beans. Clearly, the mixing of these ingredients - and others such as
lemongrass - results in tangy, stimulating, and even spicy sauces and
flavourings which elevate the prosaic nature of the staple food items.
Street foods are also a necessary adjunct of life in the city. But what a
virtue the Thais have made of their necessity, and at prices that range from
10 to 40 Baht (about 20-80 pence, depending on the size of the portions).
A strong Chinese influence is apparent in the popular Chiu Chow-style
noodles (call Gum Tiaw in Thai), and in combinations of egg noodles and
fish, seafood or meats cooked with Chiu Chow seasonings.
Chinese cooks were among the early pioneers of street cooking and, but for
the distinctive Thai seasonings, many of the street stall noodle soup
offerings could be right out of the street stalls of Canton or Hong Kong:
roast pork, fish balls, fish sausage, deep-fried dumplings, minced pork,
bean sprouts, and chives are some of the ingredients added to the noodles.
They are, indeed, a very satisfying quick bite.
Authentic Thai specialties include Khai Ping (grilled eggs with plain or
sticky rice) and Pneg Gai, chicken wings or feet marinated in fish sauce,
garlic, fresh coriander root, peppercorn. Another very popular offering is
laab, a salad that includes beef, chicken or pork. The recipe originated in
north-eastern Thailand and uses spices favoured in that region.
The meats are grilled and mixed with paste composed of dried chillies,
shallots, garlic, shrimp paste, grilled galangal (an aromatic root akin to
ginger). Other pastes are made from tamarind, water, fish sauce and roasted
rice powder. The aromas of all of these pastes and sauces fill the air in
the streets of Bangkok.
Many of the street stall proprietors are gifted cooks of great local repute.
They have their prized family recipes and are always on the alert for a new
way of doing things.
Wealthier patrons often hire them to cater for private parties. However, as
traditional as they are, the street stalls are not immune to the pressures
of Thailand's entry into the global economy. As Dr Narumol Iotivej, a native
of Bangkok, informed me, things have changed rather quickly in the last 20
years.
The original heat of the street food scene in Bangkok is an area called
Pratunam (or 'watergate'). It is still there but, she notes, it has lost
much of its former glory.
The earliest street vendors, a century ago, were from China. Today some
vendors - many of Chinese descent - have prospered and developed thriving
businesses. Since large numbers were from southern China, they were
accustomed to the long, late hours of snacking. Some of their children,
however, were reluctant to stay in the trade. The most successful have moved
indoors to new shopping centres where the recipes may be the same but the
atmosphere seems less authentic.
Meanwhile, there is still much to enjoy among street food stalls, for
example Khao Tom, a rice porridge, which the Cantonese call 'jook' or
'congee.' Other popular dishes are Kui Tia Rad Na Yod Phak, wide rice
noodles stir-fried and serve with lots of sauce, Chiu Chow style and Yum,
which encompasses all kinds of salad, cold and warm, including a real
winner, the surprisingly good Yum Hoo Moo or pig's ears salad with lime,
sugar, fish sauce, chilli or lemongrass, onion, chives and mint leaves.
I have also sampled Yum seafood, in which you tell the vendor what you would
like in the salad and it is custom made for you while you wait. Satays are a
great favourite with bits of pork, beef or chicken barbecued on bamboo
skewers.
They illustrate the Indonesian and Indian influence on Thai cookery. A
'must' is Kai Yang, in which a whole small chicken is marinated in mounds of
white peppercorns, coriander roots, garlic, fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar and
oil; then flattened and grilled.
Sugar is included in many Thai recipes, adding a sweet balance to the
generally spicy cuisine. If the food kindles your thirst there are food
stalls that specialise in orange and exotic fruit juices.
If you are not familiar with Thai cuisine and do not have a Thai- speaking
friend, you could sample street and market food in a different type of
atmosphere. For example, I recommend Lord Jim's restaurant at The Oriental
Hotel. There you may enjoy a luncheon buffet with a trolley devoted to
street food specialties. The Verandah (also at the Oriental) offers such
choices as Lad Nah Sen Gai, Ghoong, Moo Rue Varng (traditional Thai beef
salad), and a great favourite of mine Keuy Tiew Look Chin Neau - a rich beef
broth with rice noodles and meat balls.
But, wherever you try, I am certain you will enjoy the delicious experience
of Thai street food as much as I have.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Cookery: Light, bright oxtail - Comfort thoughts for mild
days
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OXTAIL is cold-weather food, synonymous with sticky-rich braises and
comforting, dumpling-topped stews - or so many believe. But there is a
lighter side to oxtail which makes it well-suited to spring and early summer
menus.
It is not food for a heat wave, perhaps, but I have found it very welcome at
the end of mild summer days.
First, you can have it coated with bread crumbs, grilled until crisp and
served with a sharp, green sauce in the manner of pig's trotters Sainte
Menehould. Second, it serves as the basis for a light, clear and very
savoury broth. Third, try it in an aspic-lined terrine when the shredded
meat is combined with hard-boiled eggs, anchovies, lemon and herbs. All
three recipes stem from the same beginnings.
OXTAIL THREE WAYS Ingredients: 2 large oxtail weighing a total of 4 1/2 lb
or more, chopped into 2 in pieces; 2-3 garlic cloves, sliced; 2 carrots,
chopped; 2 celery stalks, chopped; 1 whole onion in its skin studded with a
couple of cloves; the juice and zest of an orange; several sprigs of thyme;
a bay leaf; several parsley stalks; a generous  1/4 pt wine; 2 pt hot beef
stock (Just Bouillon by Kallo will do if you have none that is home-made).
Method: Choose a heavy, flame-proof pot with a well-fitting lid (such as a
Le Creuset casserole) that will just hold the pieces of oxtail snugly in one
layer. Trim all visible fat from the oxtail and discard all but one wadge.
Spike this with a fork and rub it over the base of the warmed pot to grease
it.
Colour the oxtail lightly all over, in batches. Stir in the garlic, carrots
and celery. Return the meat to the pot. Add the onion, orange, herbs and the
wine. Let it bubble up; then, add the stock, which should be hot and should
come nearly level with the top of the meat.
Season lightly. Bring to simmering point, cover tightly and cook gently for
2 1/2 -3 hours until the meat is very tender but not falling from the bone.
Use a gentle flame, and a simmer mat if necessary, or cook in the oven at
300`F/150`C (gas mark 2) or lower.
Set the covered casserole aside overnight. Next day, scrape off the
congealed fat that has risen to the surface. Then, re-heat the casserole
just enough to melt the jellied stock and lift out the oxtail. Strain the
remaining solids from the liquid. Discard them and cool; then, chill the
richly-flavoured stock. Any remaining fat will rise and set so that it can
be scraped off later leaving a pure, clear broth.
GRILLED OXTAIL WITH LEMON, SHALLOT AND HERB SAUCE (serves 4)
The charm of this dish lies in the contrast of textures and tastes:
gelatinous, rich meat; crisp, dry crumbs; and sharp, green dressing. It is
served best on its own, preceded or followed by a dish of vegetables.
Ingredients: The 8 largest and best pieces of oxtail cooked and cooled as
described; 4-5 oz bread, reduced to coarse crumbs; 2 juicy lemons; 6 fl oz
olive oil; 3-4 tablespoons chopped shallot;  1/2 teaspoon sugar; 2-3
tablespoons capers; 4 tablespoons parsley, preferably flat-leafed; 4
tablespoons mint; 3 tablespoons chives.
Method: Mix 3 1/2 fl oz lemon juice with the olive oil, shallot, sugar and a
good grinding of black pepper. Beat well to emulsify and pour the mixture
over the oxtail. Leave for 1 hour, turning the meat occasionally.
Then, lift out the oxtail. Coat each piece generously with bread crumbs and
lay them side by side in a gratin dish. Cook under a thoroughly pre-heated
grill for 15 minutes or so until the meat is hot right through and the crumb
coating is browned appetisingly and crisp.
Allow extra time for turning the meat and for sprinkling the bald patches
with extra crumbs. Some of them will fall off during cooking but will crisp
nicely on the bottom of the dish ready for serving. Serve on very hot plates
and hand round the sauce separately.
To make the sauce, simply supplement the vinaigrette in which the oxtail was
marinated by adding to it the capers, which should be chopped roughly, and
the herbs, which should be chopped very finely indeed.
Beat well to emulsify and season with extra sugar, salt, pepper and/or lemon
to taste.
BUTTERBEAN AND OXTAIL CONSOMME (serves 4-6)
This is simplicity itself: the reserved stock de-greased scrupulously and
garnished lightly with butterbeans for earthy/mealy contrast.
Ingredients: The stock in which the oxtail was cooked; 1 1/2 oz butterbeans;
1 1/2 -2 oz cooked oxtail meat stripped from the smallest bones;  1/2
tablespoon chopped parsley.
Method: Soak the beans overnight. Cover them with fresh cold water (no salt)
and cook until tender. Shred the meat, taking care to exclude any gristle.
Scrape every trace of fat from the surface of the jellied oxtail stock.
Heat the stock - there should be 2 pt of it. It should be very clear and
flavoured intensely, needing only a squeeze of lemon or a little salt to
season it. Reduce by fast boiling or dilute as necessary.
Add the meat to the amber liquor and bring back slowly to simmering point.
Stir in the herbs and beans. Cover the pan and set it aside for a few
minutes before serving.
OXTAIL IN ASPIC (serves 4-6)
The ratio of ingredients used here gives a good balance of textures and
flavours. If your oxtail bones yield more meat, increase the other
ingredients accordingly and use a larger mould. Pickled prunes and rye bread
and butter make excellent accompaniments.
Ingredients: 6 oz cooked oxtail meat stripped from the bones; 1 packet aspic
powder; half the anchovies from a 50-gram tin; half a lemon; 1 hard-boiled
egg; 2 generous tablespoons chopped coriander leaves.
Method: Make up the aspic according to the instructions on the packet and
let it cool until tepid. Shred the meat, taking care to exclude any gristle,
and put it into a bowl.
Add the finely-grated lemon zest,  1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice, the herbs,
and the anchovies rinsed of their oil and snipped into short lengths. Mix
gently, stirring in gradually  3/4 pt of cool aspic.
Ladle the mixture into a 1 1/2 pt mould, such as a loaf tin or shallow bowl,
adding slices of the hard-boiled egg here and there. Cover and chill for at
least 6 hours until set solid. Un-mould and slice for serving, using a sharp
knife dipped in hot water and dried.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A Blue Elephant in Paris - Thai food in some
of Europe's capital cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROPOSED site, atop a renowned hotel, offering clear views across the
Seine to the Eiffel tower, would have delighted any restaurateur. But Karl
Steppe, Belgian chairman of the Blue Elephant group of Thai restaurants,
politely turned it down.
Instead, he opened his company's fourth restaurant on a site with no views
at all in the Rue de la Roquette in the less-impressive Bastille area of
Paris (Tel: 47 00 42 84). Explaining his decision, he said: 'How could any
French diner believe they were in Thailand when they looked out on to such a
unique symbol of France?'
Over the past decade, Steppe has discovered that there is another potential
answer to that most elusive question: 'What makes a successful restaurant?'
He believes that he has succeeded, not just by offering authentic Thai food
 -and the growing interest in Indo-Chinese cuisine has obviously been a
great advantage - but by offering his European customers a night out in
Thailand.
Not that Steppe had this in mind when he first visited Thailand, in the late
1970s, when he was an antique dealer on a buying trip. But the ability to
quench Europeans' growing Western interest in the Far East, both
aesthetically and gastronomically, soon found an outlet when the first Blue
Elephant opened in Brussels in 1982. Steppe's Bangkok office now ships two
tonnes of Thai produce a week to Europe.
Arithmetic also played a crucial part. If the interiors of the Blue Elephant
were to resemble Thai villages, complete with rush matting, verdant plants
representing the undergrowth, waterfalls and bridges over ponds filled with
tropical fish, then Steppe would not have to join fellow restaurateurs in
the race for the more fashionable, but increasingly expensive, restaurant
locations. Hence, his decision in 1984 to open at the unfashionable end of
Fulham Broadway in south west London (tel: 071-385-6595) with views across a
busy road to the Underground station.
Make the interior unique, he argues, and the exterior is unimportant.
Simultaneously, Steppe realised that he could create a new pricing policy.
Most restaurant - goers had long associated Indo-Chinese food with quick and
cheap eating. His restaurant in Paris is surrounded by Indian and Japanese
restaurants with menus at FFr100 (Pounds 12.01). Take the interior up
market, staff it with young, permanently smiling Thai waiting staff who bow
and hand an orchid to every female diner (the London branch imports 1,500
orchid stalks a week) and you can charge considerably more. Going to the
Blue Elephants in London and Paris was an experience.
It was certainly an experience for colleagues in the French press - the
restaurant writers from Le Monde, L'Express and Le Figaro among others and
the Thai ambassador to France - when the Blue Elephant won the Marco
Polo-Casanova award for the best ambassador of foreign cuisine in Paris.
Sensibly, the Thai chefs did not deviate from the flavours that make their
cuisine unique. They used to great advantage lemon grass, chillies, sweet
coconut milk, coriander, ginger and peanuts. Banana leaves were served hot,
stuffed with steamed fish and dill, and cold, served with diced chicken
sweetened with coconut - the latter given a distinct bite by the spring
onions underneath. Other dishes reflected the country's proximity to India
and China.
Beef stewed with Mennam spices showed that the Thai use of spices can be
less aggressive than in much Indian cooking but a green chicken curry, using
an imported curry paste barely lightened by coconut cream, anaesthetised my
lips.
Stir fried bean curd and sweet barbecued pork would appeal to any aficionado
of Chinese food but the two dishes that most appealed me were distinctly
Thai - tapioca balls filled with prawns and peanut followed by satay of
piquant meat balls.
The Blue Elephant chain is run on strict guidelines. It believes in quality
food and wants to ensure that its restaurants are a commercial success. This
last factor leads to two caveats. Firstly, the pricing of its individual
dishes is steep. In London first courses range from Pounds 5-Pounds 7, main
courses Pounds 8-Pounds 10 without rice, cover charge, 15 per cent service -
or the Thai beer that you will probably want to order with your food.
The style of this food can easily induce you to over-order and it would be
prudent to experiment with one of their set meals or, most economically, to
take advantage of their keenly priced Sunday buffet (Pounds 14.50 per head).
You would be wise to pay by cash or cheque in London. The Blue Elephant
charges 15 per cent service but, unashamedly, fails to close off the credit
card slips. This is another reason why the government's recent decision not
to legislate on restaurant service charges is against the public interest -
but that is another story. However, why a restaurant group that has
otherwise sought to win over custom in so many original ways should behave
in this fashion is beyond me.
Blue Elephant restaurants are also at: 1120 Chausee de Waterloo, 1180
Brussels (tel: 374 49 62); and SAS Scandinavia Hotel, 70 Arnager Boulevard,
2300 Copenhagen (33 11 15 00).

FT  08 MAY 93 / Gardening: Storm-smashed Tresco proves there is life on
earth after death - Robin Lane Fox visits the Isles of Scilly and finds that
a horticultural paradise is being regained, slowly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE JUST spent two days, walking through a paradise which is recovering
from disaster. Disasters are not supposed to happen in paradise and they
make me desperate but, in future, I will remember Tresco - the proof that
there is life on earth after death.
For more than 100 years there have been huge, private gardens dotted out in
the Atlantic at Tresco abbey on the Isles of Scilly . In 1893, the
Gardeners' Chronicle wrote: 'Never have the fine sub-tropical gardens of
Tresco presented such a remarkable appearance as at the present time, nor
has its equal been seen in any other part of the United Kingdom, perhaps not
in Europe.'
In those days, there was no helicopter to shorten the journey - although
there was a railway to Penzance, which was possibly no slower than the
modern version on a bad day.
Nonetheless, for years I never went there. The flora sounded completely
alien and needed an Arthur Hellyer to understand it. I dislike palms, and
some of the old photos implied a style of seaside bedding which looked as if
it was training for Britain in Bloom.
Paradise repaid the compliment and managed happily without me until I
planned to catch a boat in 1987. It forestalled me by falling to pieces: a
freak month of snow and chilly wind beset the gardens and murdered the
flora, which had never known such conditions before. The famous flame trees
died by the score and more than 90 per cent of the rarities from the
Antipodes were destroyed.
The staff tried to rally under the leadership of Mike Nelhams, then only 30
but appointed as head gardener a short time before. By 1990, progress had
been promising and I planned again for a visit.
But paradises do not like atheists: a stupendous gale in January that year
wiped out the tall cover, ripped through the boundary trees and disposed of
the garden's backbone. If I had been in charge, I would have resigned the
following morning.
Not so Nelhams (or Tresco's present owner, Robert Dorrien Smith). Perhaps it
was fortunate that disaster befell two men young enough to be resilient.
While the older, life-long staff were distraught, Nelhams could see the
chance for a resurrection - rather than a mindless restoration - with the
scope for variation and possible improvement.
Such is Tresco's collection that it is easy to forget the place was funded
entirely privately. A century ago its founder, Augustus Smith, was known for
being almost too covetous of plants and 'gifts' from the Royal Botanic
Garden at Kew, in London. His successor maintained equally wide contacts -
among them, the great garden at La Mortola, the child of the Hanbury family
who were planting in a remarkably similar style.
Since 1987, Tresco has been begging once again from Kew and ordering seeds
from the newly-revived La Mortola list. English Heritage has made a generous
commitment to an agreed five-year plan, which could cost up to Pounds
400,000 eventually and involves massive clearing and replanting several
thousand trees on the adjoining hill.
Otherwise, Tresco has to fund itself to the tune of about Pounds 90,000. Up
to Pounds 20,000 comes from its notable plant stall and most of the rest
from visitors' fees. There might be rather more if a stop could be put to
French visitors' occasional habit of rear entry. The less thoughtful of them
still land on the beach and - as I discovered while inspecting the nursery -
enter illicitly, like Norman raiders, over the low garden wall.
The rest of you should certainly go through the gate and enjoy what is on
show already. Masses of plants are in flower; the famous hedges of holm oak
are still in place; the Canary Island palms seem quite untroubled; and
rarities from Mexico have proved much tougher than expected.
On almost every point, my mind's-eye view of Tresco has been refuted. I had
thought the place was an unstructured jungle; that the plants were all
steamy cacti; and that you had only to plant a cutting and the Gulf Stream,
the soil and the humidity would hurry it to maturity within three years.
Admittedly, there is a plant from Tresco in the Guinness Book of Records:
once, a yucca Whipplei grew more than 12 ft in only 14 days. The growth,
however, was its flower stem. Elsewhere, progress is much slower.
The garden is very dry: the soil is less than 2 ft deep above much of the
granite and the staff of only four full-timers cannot water seriously in 12
acres of flower-bed. It rises steeply from lower to upper terraces and the
climate varies from cool to hot and barren. Even before 1987, it took a
flame tree 30 years to reach a significant height.
Almost every year since the 1880s, diarists have been referring to sea gales
and the losses of a few significant trees; 1990 differed in degree, not
kind, but the loss of the windbreaks has been doubly awful. The lower layers
are now exposed to new winds and drought and the views are no compensation.
'If I can see a view,' Nelhams told me, 'it means that the wind can see me.'
Tresco's core is a pair of long, straight walks, less than 10 ft wide, which
cross at right angles and run its entire length and width. They remind me at
once of the similar backbone to great Italian Renaissance gardens; the Villa
Medici, for instance, in Rome. Tresco's first owner must have seen them, a
model for his plan which is wonderfully formal at its centre.
Even before the storms, there were old friends among the exotics. Huge trees
of camellias rub shoulders with rare banksias; honeysuckle is mixed among
rarities from New Zealand; the abutilons are a fabulous sight with their
white and mauve flowers; the subtly winding path on the upper terrace runs
between a steep rockery, set with familiar pelargoniums and non-rock plants.
The soft plantings and the tender echiums are looking spectacular this
weekend, bearing great spikes of flower like erect foxes' brushes in shades
of violet and blue; if you can find it, echium Webbii is the most brilliant
blue wonder, but only for a frost-free garden.
At Tresco, Nelhams told me, 'the usual rules of colour planning do not
apply.' And, as the sun set on the lovely homerias on the upper terrace, I
eavesdropped on two tourists, startled by the echoes of their own Australia.
'If only the whole island looked like this garden,' they told each other,
wistfully, 'we could imagine we were back at home.' To my eye, it is a mercy
that it never will.
Forty years from now, with luck, my old age and your children will together
appreciate Paradise Regained. Tresco owes a huge debt to the Nelhams'
optimism, the backing of the family, and the devoted work of the few
gardeners. One of the most important recoveries in British gardening history
looks as if it will succeed. But we must pray for more winters like 1992 and
rapid success for the new Heritage windbreaks.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Rebuilding the mill: an exceedingly slow grind: Clive Fewins
on a group of pensioners who are restoring a landmark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NINETEEN years after they started work, Quainton Mill's 'Magnificent Seven'
at last have their end in sight.
When the small group of enthusiasts started restoring the windmill as a
retirement project in 1974 they thought it would be a five- or six-year
task. The mill is Victorian, it stands 75ft and when it was built it was the
most up-to-date in the Vale of Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire.
In 1984 the group decided not to hold a tenth birthday celebration as there
was so little visible progress. Nine years later they are in a jubilant
mood, as they have just completed the massive task of building and erecting
the four 30ft wood and canvas sails, each weighing a ton.
Last weekend the sails turned successfully and tomorrow, Sunday, to
celebrate National Mills Day there will be tours of the mill and a
photographic exhibition inside.
'Who knows, we might be milling in time for the millennium,' said the
project leader, architect Patrick Tooms. At 61 Tooms is one of the younger
members of the group.
They hope to complete the task in four to five years, and that they will be
able to achieve this using entirely voluntary labour without exceeding the
original budget of Pounds 15,000. They have spent some Pounds 13,000, of
which about three quarters came in grants from various public bodies and the
New Horizon trust, which supports unusual activities by retired people.
'Heroic' would be a fitting word for some of the efforts of the restorers,
for whom the first task was to rebuild from scratch the huge wooden gallery
that surrounds the building at a height of 35ft, without the use of a
scaffold.
One of the next jobs was rebuilding the top few courses of brick-work so
that they could start restoring the mechanism that allows the giant metal
cap to rotate on a circular metal track on top of the walls.
'At the time we had a psychiatrist working with us whose hobby was
bricklaying,' Tooms said. 'But that wasn't the only mad thing we have got up
to.'
Perhaps the maddest thing of all was building the mill in the first place.
It is picturesquely but impractically sited in the lee of the hill that
forms a backcloth to the village.
It was this situation, coupled with the fact that the mill never worked very
efficiently, that meant the basic structure of the building was in such good
condition when the group started the restoration.
Although the mill, the tallest in Buckinghamshire, was equipped with all the
latest technology when it was completed in 1832, the one thing it always
lacked was a good blow. So after a working life of some 50 years - latterly
assisted by a huge steam engine - it was abandoned.
It remained in that state, an eyecatching relic, until the late 1960s, when
the parish council decided the community would benefit if it could be
restored.
'Today people jokingly suggest that our main achievement has been to add
value to every house in the village as the mill now adds so much to the
character of the place,' Tooms said.
'Until we recog much of the main spur wheel - one of the major remaining
tasks - and get all the machinery working, we shan't know whether there's
enough wind to grind corn. It's a case of suck it and see,' said Tooms'
right hand man, retired airline pilot Gordon Rodwell, 70.
Nevertheless the great task continues every Sunday. The total workforce
numbers nine, though there are never more than seven present at the weekly
work sessions.
The oldest member is retired sales executive Denis Moreton, 80, the
youngest, and the only one who is not retired or semi-retired, is carpenter
Bob Bleasdale, 40.
There is an air of optimism in the group, and as part of the transition from
millwrights to millers they plan to pay a joint visit to one or two of the
four commercial working windmills in the country.
'We shall soon be able to run the machinery and see what happens,' Tooms
said. 'We are used to taking one thing at a time, so no setback is too
catastrophic. With an average age in the group of 63 all we hope is that we
are all alive to see the end result]'
Quainton Mill is open from 10am-1pm on Sundays.
For details of mills open on National Mills Day tomorrow, telephone:
0367-718888 (today) and 0442-862193 (tomorrow).

FT  08 MAY 93 / Property: The lure of life down by the old mill stream -
Chaucer and George Eliot wrote about it but prospective owners must have a
liking for water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OWNERS of watermills must like water. Even if the leat
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the channel that takes water from the main stream to the mill - has dried
up, the river will be flowing nearby.
Watermills are not for parents who worry about children falling in. But they
make satisfying, romantic houses, rich in associations. And there are plenty
of them - if often ruined - since, from medieval times onwards, every
community wanted its own mill. Like blacksmiths' forges, they were essential
to agricultural life.
Wind and watermills made cheap power, as hydro-electric schemes and wind
farms continue to do. With the Industrial Revolution, the principles of
grinding flour by water power were adapted to textiles and other industries,
and the word 'mill' took on the extra meaning of a factory.
Millers prospered, and often had a reputation for being unscrupulous. The
usual way to pay them was a proportion of the flour, which they sold on.
Chaucer wrote about a 16-stone miller with a wart on his nose while George
Eliot, in The Mill on the Floss, has the stubborn, eager-to-expand and
irascible miller Tulliver ruined after losing a case about water rights. But
Pedham Mill in Constable's paintings has a peace that greed could never
disturb.
Few windmills have become houses, since their wood has not survived so well
on the exposed sites they need and being round makes them more difficult to
adapt. Also, they are colder than watermills, sheltered in the valley. But
Gibraltar Mill at Great Bardfield, Essex, a 17th century brick tower mill
with boat-shaped cap, has just been sold by Mullucks Wells for close to the
asking price of Pounds 195,000. As you would expect, it has splendid views
and some internal machinery survives. The stocks, sweeps and fantail outside
were renewed in 1988.
If you are looking for a watermill, decide if you want one that still has
its machinery, either working or derelict. Do you want to restore it as
industrial archaeology? Or will it be a relief if only the pond and mill
race are left?
If the leat is dry, it becomes a curious channel in the garden to remind you
of what is no more. If it runs, does it have trout or could you stock it?
(If you want to remove machinery and the mill is listed, check with the
district council to see if that needs listed building consent because the
equipment counts as fixtures).
Several West Country mills are for sale. Cheapest is The Mill in the village
of Heasley Mill on Exmoor, with the old drive wheel and two sets of granite
millstones in what is now the kitchen. Stags in Dulverton offers it for
around Pounds 115,000. The South Molton branch of that firm is selling
Colleton Mill, near Chulmleigh between Exeter and Barnstaple, making a
substantial house for Pounds 138,500.
Near the north Devon coast and almost in Cornwall is Docton Mill, at
Hartland. It has seven acres of well-known gardens, the head weir to divert
water into the leat - which has wild brown trout - and a traditional
miller's apple orchard. (These were more to provide wood for the machinery
than for fruit).
Down the valley, the water from the leat and stream pour over a 60 ft
waterfall onto the beach, which is good for bathing, surfing and fishing.
Gribble Booth &amp; Taylor offers it at around Pounds 250,000.
In Somerset, Sea Mills Farm at Peasmarsh, near Ilminster and close to the
A3O3 and M5, comes with 15 acres, a leat stocked with trout and two ponds
fed by the river Ilse (from Jackson-Stops at around Pounds 350,000). Near
Frome is the 19th century Iron Mill at Oldford, with fishing rights on leat
and river and a guide price of Pounds 310,000 from Cluttons.
As recently as 1969, Bishopstrow Mill on the river Wylye, near Warminster,
was said to be the last working mill in Wiltshire. Now, the mill race is
illuminated beneath the drawing room floor. It is new on the market, from
Hamptons or Cluttons at around Pounds 270,000.
Dearer, and easier for London, is the Old Mill at Hook near Basingstoke,
Hampshire, a warm 17th century brick and timber house converted as early as
1910. It has eight acres and trout fishing on the river Whitewater; from
Strutt &amp; Parker at around Pounds 630,000.
The Sack Hoist is a penthouse flat in the mill at Kintbury, which overlooks
the river Kennet and the Kennet and Avon canal between Newbury and
Hungerford in Berkshire; the hoist is the projecting loft for lifting sacks
of corn to the top floor. The 1982 conversion won an award for architect
Paul Palmer &amp; Smith. The flat has two bedrooms, a lease with 88 years left
and ground rent of just Pounds 10. John D. Wood is seeking Pounds 120,000
for this unusual abode.
Nearby in Boxford, and close to junction 13 on the M4, the Mill House is
more conventional. It also has trout fishing - on the river Lambourn - and
comes with 18 acres for about Pounds 650,000 from Strutt &amp; Parker.
In the Suffolk countryside painted by Constable is Raydon Mill, on the river
Brett near Hadleigh. The main room has a glass panel in the floor to see the
mill race. With a mill cottage, outbuildings, fishing and four acres, it is
on offer for around Pounds 350,000 from Savills in Ipswich.
Cheaper at Pounds 295,000, perhaps for being beside the railway line to
Cambridge, is the Mill House at Elsenham, a village near Bishops Stortford
that gave its name to a range of jams. It is built of brick with a diamond
pattern in the roof tiles, and dates to 1668 when a London family settled
there after fleeing the plague. Inquiries to Mullucks Wells.
Plashet Mill, five miles from Blairgowrie in Perthshire, Scotland, was a
derelict woollen mill until converted recently. It has a splendid site above
the Black Water at Bridge of Gaily, and offers over Pounds 195,000 are
sought by Savills in Brechin.
Tomorrow, meanwhile, is National Mills Day when the Wind and Watermill
Section of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (37 Spital
Square, London El 6DY) urges a visit to your local mill. This essential
group for mill buffs publishes a newsletter which includes a regular list of
mills for sale.
An Italian proverb says: 'Mills and wives are ever wanting.' At least you
can buy a mill on the open market and test this saying's veracity . . .

FT  08 MAY 93 / How to Spend It: Light, airy and small
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WHEN JEREMY Melvin, a working journalist and academic, bought a top-floor
flat in a standard end-of-terrace Victorian cottage near Waterloo, he was
faced with a familiar problem - how to conjure a light, airy environment out
of an intrinsically restricted space, how to find a working area for himself
and shelves for all his books.
He asked Allford Hall Monaghan Morris Architects to tackle the problem.
The flat was too small to lend itself to a major conversion. Melvin's main
brief to his architects was to rewire, clean up and redecorate, tidy the
kitchen and bathroom and create space for him to work and hold large
parties.
The solution to the study area was partly inspired by an Antonella painting
in the National Gallery (photographed here) and partly by Melvin's own
statement that the hall, between the living and bedrooms, he found was one
of the most congenial parts of the flat.
Using the headroom over the landing and space above the head of the
staircase, a study area was made. The whole structure - desk, platform and
toughened glass balustrade - is cantilevered off side walls by a steel
structure. The end result is light and airy. The desk, of aluminium
honeycomb sandwiched between two pieces of glass, reflects light and yet is
sturdy enough to support necessary equipment.
The wall in the hallway is now filled with books. To meet the brief for a
space large enough for a biggish party the doors into the living-room and
into the kitchen were widened so that the two spaces could be united.
The end result is simple and functional but with enough character to please
the eye and spirit as well. All this was done for Pounds 20,000.

FT  08 MAY 93 / How to Spend It: A conservatory without historical pastiche
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STATISTICS tell us that adding a conservatory is top of the home-improvement
popularity pole - but you have only to look in most decorating magazines to
see that the prevailing taste seems to run to Victorian or Gothic-style
reproductions.
Form Design, with a fascinating project carried out on a listed house in
Montpelier Row, Twickenham, not only has provided a successful solution for
a particular house, but may perhaps provide inspiration for those who have
always felt that there ought to be more to conservatory life than historical
pastiche.
Montpelier Row dates from 1720 and the lower ground floor area constituted
about a quarter of the house area, but it was dark, dingy and unattractive.
Form Design's brief was to liberate the space, to create a family kitchen
and dining area as well as the conservatory, and to respect the original
fabric and architecture of the house.
Form Design aimed to make any new addition as neutral as possible and as
contemporary as possible. As Malcolm Crayton, the architect in charge of the
project puts it: 'We wanted to design in the spirit of the original building
but did not want to create a pastiche.'
The result is a clean, simple solution, which depends on a light touch, a
respect for proportion, for simple planes and shapes. The company achieved
this by building a frameless glass structure which allows the light to flow
in from the south-facing garden.
The company reversed the positions of the dining and kitchen areas. The low
ceiling, is scarcely noticeable. All the finishes are light, from the steel
and maple kitchen island, echoing the large, traditional kitchen table, to
the honey-coloured limestone floor and colour-washed walls. Total cost of
the project was Pounds 47,500.

Small, domestic architectural projects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
COME difficult times and architects are among the first to suffer. The last
few years have been tougher than any in living memory. From big companies,
to small, specialist groups, hardly one has not had to rethink, retrench and
regroup.
Bad times for architects are often good times for clients. In Britain a host
of young, hungry practices now has the time and energy to invest in small
projects - which means that customers will get better value than ever.
Clients can be rewarded with the undivided attention of some talented
architects. For the architect, any project, no matter how small, is better
than no work at all, and, after all, small projects can eventually lead to
bigger ones. Many are hungry for the work experience and some actually
prefer smaller projects.
One reason why architects in the UK are not better used - and better
understood - seems to be nervousness on the part of the public. Many people
seem to feel that using an architect is the path to outrageous extravagance
 -if not uncompromising design.
Zeev Aram, of Aram Designs, believes passionately in persuading people that
architects are much more than an expensive luxury. A good architect can
provide a better solution at lower cost than the haphazard amateur approach
that most householders adopt on their own.
Hoping to make the public more aware of just what a difference a good
architect can make to any house project, Zeev Aram has taken an exhibition,
originally on at the Royal Institute of British Architects in Portland
Place, London, and is displaying it in his Hampstead, London, showrooms
where he hopes to attract the house-converting classes.
Every project on show has cost less than Pounds 50,000 and I feel sure that
visitors will be amazed at what good value clients receieved. The work of
Britain's youngest,most promising architects is on show.
The exhibition is on at Aram Designs, 65 Heath Street, Hampstead, London NW3
6UG from now until May 16, so hurry, hurry. Featured on this page are a few
of the most domestic projects.

<TEXT>
ELIZABETH HALWAS does wondrous things with shimmering lengths of Indian
silk. She starts by pleating it, Fortuny-style, and then she turns the
results into accessories. Most desirable are probably her bags in gold,
bronze, silver, green, purple, or almost any other colour - each one
different.
Many come embellished with beads - either antique Indian silver, onyx and
hermatine, tiger eye or any semi-precious stone. Others are embellished with
fresh water pearls or oyster shell and real pearls. She is willing to make
to order.
Plain silks come in all colours but there is a heavier metal and silk
mixture which comes only in silver, gold, green or purple.
Sketched here are just two examples of her designs. They are almost works of
art in themselves and are clearly for nothing more practical than an evening
out to dinner.
Prices range from Pounds 90 to about Pounds 140. Lucienne Phillips, at 89
Knightsbridge, London SW1, has a good selection. Otherwise they can be
bought directly from Elizabeth Halwas, 34 Cornwall Gardens, London SW7 (by
appointment only, tel: 071-937-4703). She is also happy to dispatch by mail.
Halwas also does beautiful scarves - a sliver of pleated gold or bronze at
the neck does wonders for the most boring black dress. For those who fall in
love with the fabric she can do larger garments. She would be happy to
discuss designs by telephone.

FT  08 MAY 93 / How to Spend It: How minimalism changed Patricia's lifestyle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PATRICIA IJAZ decided to get professional architectural help when she could
not sell her dark and cramped London flat. In despair she decided that if
she could not sell it she might as well see what an architect could do to
make living there more bearable.
She found Jonathan Woolf and her life was transformed. The ground floor,
one-bedroom apartment took up just 70 square metres in a Victorian mansion
block. The kitchen was too small, the bathroom too large and the corridor
long and claustrophobic.
Much of the skill of the conversion depends on Jonathan Woolf's skilful use
of light which gives the whole flat a warm airiness. All is designed to give
the illusion of greater space. Much thought has gone into the small things
that contribute to the sum of the whole - the placing of a sofa, how to link
the rooms visually, what materials and surfaces to use, which direction to
lay the floorboards.
There is a suspended gallery which Jonathan Woolf devised to 'liberate the
space'. This provides the study area and a steel ladder links it to the
ground. Wood floors replace fitted carpets. Where once there were ponderous
radiators now the heat source is invisible, hidden under the floorboards.
The curtains came down and were replaced with blinds. New and taller door
openings encourage Patricia to use the whole apartment as one space. Fiddly,
unnecessary details have been removed, liberating not just the space but the
eye, so that the whole flat has an air of calm.
The space is still small, but the air of depressing darkness and smallness
has gone. Patricia Ijaz has embraced minimalism and found she likes it.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Fashion: The evidence points to the judge in moonboots -
Dressing for the Professions, The Lawyer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONG arm of the lawyer is dressed, according to convention, in sombre
black, charcoal or navy. This is not so true universally as it used to be,
except for formal court appearances, but the outside world could be forgiven
for assuming that little has changed since the days of Dickens' Jarndyce and
Jarndyce.
Lawyers never feature in the 'best-dressed' lists and the law is arguably
still the most conservatively dressed of professions partly because of what
City solicitor Julian Harris calls 'the dignity of the law.'
Lord MacKay of Clashfern, the Lord Chancellor, recently issued a discussion
paper questioning the basis of formal court dress, but, says Harris:
'Clients like to see their lawyer in a gown and a sober suit. It implies
seriousness and reliability. I always wonder how American lawyers, in
short-sleeved summer shirts and no tie, command any respect.'
The word that trips most regularly off legal tongues in relation to their
dress is 'professional'. The universal drive is for appropriateness,
although the sombre public image of lawyers is self-perpetuating in that
most like to dress as the client would expect. There is also a tacit
suggestion that discussing dress trivialises the profession.
Yet thinking about their own dress and commenting on that of others is rife.
It is perhaps inevitable that a profession which thrives on details and
minutiae, and which dresses in uniform, should register any act of
non-conformity - a tendency magnified by the cloistered, collegiate
atmosphere of the Inns of Court. Equally, there are those who, within the
obvious constraints, make a point of expressing their individuality, subtly.
Charles Gray QC, a libel specialist involved in many cases brought against
the media, is regarded as cutting a dapper figure. His wide-lapelled,
double-breasted chalkstripe suit - bought off-the-peg - gold cufflinks and
discreetly bright tie are as effortlessly stylish as the comfortable antique
furniture in his chambers. But he says: 'This is a profession where one is
deliberately not making a statement. A court is a formal situation where
minimum standards must be maintained and not to do so would have a
deleterious effect. So we agree on a dress code and it is not an issue.
Anyone keen on exotic dress would be unlikely to choose the Bar as a
career.'
He agrees there have been changes. 'Twenty years ago barristers still wore a
costume of black jacket, striped trousers and bowler hat and more recently a
waistcoat was the rule in court. Now double-breasted suits are more
fashionable. Standard dress does alter but not in a time-scale of less than
five years.'
Julian Harris is more openly flamboyant. His suits are traditional enough -
with a penchant for nostalgia. He has three-piece suits made by Hackett -
but he believes 'one can express individuality with colour, in ties, shirts
and socks.' A senior partner once told him that 'a tie should always mean
something,' implying it should be club or regimental. To Harris it should
mean something about the wearer's personality. His own occasional treat is a
Hermes tie, justified by the fact that at least two of his clients wear
them.
'Years ago when I was still articled, I once wore a three-piece tweed suit.
The senior partner merely said, 'off to the country are we?' but I've never
done it again.'
Even less is needed to cause comment out of London. Nick Toovey is a partner
in a big Cambridge firm, with clients varying from farmers to academics and
high-tech companies.
'Our style is not as provincial as the brown tweed suits you might find in a
market town practice,' he says. 'I dress as I think the client would expect
and that usually means a dark suit. But in summer I occasionally wear a
lightweight suit or jacket and trousers which my colleagues find quite
radical. I also like the individuality of bow-ties which are a bit of fun
when the client is appropriate.'
Another aspect of the law's eye for detail is the network of rules governing
dress in court which are rigorously applied by some judges and not just
elderly male ones. Baroness Mallalieu, QC, saw a particularly fierce woman
silk, now retired, castigate a young female barrister wearing a black but
sleeveless dress. The barrister bought a pair of long evening gloves and cut
off the hands. Women in striped shirts were known to hide in the robing room
lavatories until the same silk was out of the way. Lady Mallalieu was told
off as a young barrister when, having scraped her long fair hair back so it
was invisible from the front, the resulting ponytail showed outside her
gown.
Dress is still a sensitive issue for the growing number of women lawyers.
Some fashion companies aim to help - Austin Reed has a specialised
department and runs conferences at its stores round the country. Robe
suppliers Ede and Ravenscroft recently asked young designer Bella Freud to
produce a capsule collection, though its uncompromisingly pinstriped nature
is not to everyone's taste. They are also stocking the shirt range by
Madeleine Hamilton, herself a former solicitor, who appreciates the need for
good-quality shirts that are plain, comfortable but with interesting
details.
Younger women lawyers see little need for such specialist sartorial
resources. Gillie Belsham is a young partner in a City solicitors' firm. Her
work, which concerns marine insurance, includes court appearances, client
meetings and ship inspections worldwide, and gives scope for a surprisingly
varied wardrobe.
'I am not afraid to look as if I'm interested in fashion as an expression of
my personality,' she says. 'It should never obscure my professionalism but I
won't spend my working life in a sub-knee A-line skirt. I want to look and
feel confident and efficient and don't want to think about my clothes once
they are on. And the law is no longer a 'man's world' where one might feel
the need to ape men in pinstripes or mannish jackets.'
She has evolved her own version of the working woman's wardrobe -
non-matching jacket and skirt just above the knee, with the jacket dark for
court, bright or pastel for client meetings, the skirt always dark, with a
simple silk or cotton shirt or cashmere sweater, complementary but discreet
jewellery and bright lipstick. She likes feminine, fitted jackets, either
short and curvaceous or long and collarless, and finds she gets more mileage
and fewer mistakes from designer labels than the middle market - Valentino,
St Laurent and Anne Klein are her favourites.
Having declared her interest in fashion, she finds her style changing faster
than the men's five-year-plus timescale. The power suit looks dated now and
chiffon scarves, softer necklines and more fluid fabrics like crepe are
creeping into her wardrobe. A wrap crepe skirt looks smarter with her fitted
jacket than the straight jersey skirt she would previously have chosen.
Ironically, her first appearance in the new longline skirt caused as much
comment as the first short skirts did five years ago and most women still
choose short for court.
In the end, it is perhaps a matter of what you can get away with, and for a
competent and confident lawyer that can be a lot.
Baroness Mallalieu knows at least one male barrister with a ponytail and
several women silks who wear trousers in chambers. 'Then there is the
question of boots in court,' she says. 'I've always worn them, ever since I
appeared in a freezing cold county court and discovered afterwards that
under his robes the judge was wearing moonboots.'

FT  08 MAY 93 / Motoring: Volvo estate goes glam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ANGULAR lines are softened only slightly and the 850 looks like a
traditional Volvo estate car. But appearance deceives; it is a different
animal.
The ever-popular, rear-wheel driven 240, 740 and 940 estates can all be
traced back to the original 144 of 1967. The 850 - front-wheel driven and
powered by a silky, sideways-mounted, multi-valve, five-cylinder engine - is
the load-carrying version of Volvo's latest (and best by far) sedan. It has
just gone on sale in Britain at prices ranging from Pounds 17,795 for the
two-litre 850 SE to Pounds 21,395 for a 2.5-litre 850 GLT.
Volvo has pitched the 850 estate at younger owners with fewer encumbrances:
in short, the kind of people who want a car that drives responsively but
need the versatility of an estate. The company expects to sell around 3,000
in Britain this year and thinks many will go to fairly affluent family men
in their late 30s; in other words, typical Audi or BMW drivers. Such drivers
would not previously have considered a Volvo because they felt they were not
old enough.
The 850 estate will, I think, surprise and impress them. Like the BMW
5-Series Touring (this column, April 24) or an Audi 80 or 100 estate, it
combines sporting verve with reasonable bulk-carrying capacity. Handling and
road-holding are, of course, as safe and predictable as one expects of a
Volvo. But there is no trace of the cart-horse about an 850 estate. It is a
car in which long journeys on winding, hilly roads are to be enjoyed, not
suffered.
The acid test of an estate car's suspension, especially a big one, is how it
performs with only the driver on board. Some feel rather bouncy when running
light but improve as weight is added. The 850's ride is always relaxingly
shock-absorbent, yet it corners with a sporty saloon's precision. A 33ft
(10.2m) turning circle makes it as handy in confined spaces as a small
hatchback.
Volvo claims the 850 is 'probably the safest estate on the market.' Its body
sides are single steel pressings laser-welded to the roof, and the force of
a side-on impact is distributed over several elements to retain survival
space. Anti-lock brakes are standard and a traction control system, using
the same electronics, is an option. Front-seat airbags will be available
later in the year.
While the 850 is no match for a traditional, rear-wheel drive Volvo estate
in sheer carrying capacity, it will be big enough for most buyers. (How
often do you see a Volvo estate crammed absolutely full?). With the
split-fold rear seat back-rest down, the load floor is a mere 64.5in (162cm)
long compared with a 240's 77.6in (194in) or a 940's 74in (185cm). But the
rear cushion folds forward to protect the front seat-backs, and converting
the 850 into a load-carrier could not be easier.
Meanwhile, if you have a Volvo 240 and use it as a bulk cargo-carrier, do
not wait too long to order a replacement. This cheap (from under Pounds
14,000 list) and ultra-roomy veteran will not be available after October. It
will be missed sadly.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Sport: Formula which can't find success - Motor Racing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British Grand Prix at Silverstone is one of the premier events in the
sporting calendar, attracting a crowd in excess of 200,000 over three days.
The 16 grand prix that make up the world championship all draw big crowds.
But motor racing, unlike some other sports, resembles a head without a body.
International football matches may pull the punters in, but so does the
Premier League every week. Test matches attract big crowds, but so do the
one-day knock-out competitions. Apart from the grand prix, however,
attendances at motor races are usually very small.
Last Monday, there was a Formula 3000 meeting at Donington Park. You have
probably never heard of the formula but, in the motor racing pecking order,
it is second only to Formula One. The cars look like F1 cars. The engines
are very powerful, the racing is always close and, for the drivers, it is
the last stepping-stone before F1. Since it was introduced in 1985,
virtually all grand prix drivers have graduated via F3000. Yet the crowd at
Donington Park was a paltry 5,000 and the one for the meeting at Silverstone
tomorrow will be little better.
The problem is not confined to Britain. Only when the race is held during a
grand prix weekend, as at Spa in Belgium or Hockenheim in Germany, do
attendances become respectable. The other exception is the street race at
Pau in the Pyrennees when motor racing goes to the people. The fact that
F3000 meetings attract such small crowds is partly a function of the limited
draw which motor racing remains outside F1. But that is not the only reason.
F3000, unlike F1 is starved of publicity. The key is television. This has
transformed the profile of F1 since the mid-70s, and is now beginning to
work its magic on the British touring car championship which is being
broadcast regularly by the BBC. Apart from small satellite stations,
however, F3000 gets no television coverage whatsoever.
Wandering around a more or less empty Donington last Monday, the inevitable
question was: how does the whole thing survive? There are few spectators, no
television receipts, and little advertising. And F3000 does not come cheap:
a new Reynard, the dominant chassis this year, costs Pounds 115,000, two
engines for the season a further Pounds 125,000, and the electronics some
Pounds 30,000. This is just for one car, and most teams run two. Then there
are the staff, perhaps 15 or so full-time. One could go on: the tyre bill
for the average team at Donington was over Pounds 7,000. And then there are
the fixed costs, the transporters, the office and so forth.
Keith Wiggins, the owner of one of the top teams, Pacific Racing, estimates
that, to do the full nine-race season with two cars, he needs to raise
Pounds 1.2m, most of it through sponsorship. So far the team has Pounds
600,000. Unlike in F1, though, where the teams raise the bulk of the
sponsorship money themselves, in F3000 the drivers are responsible for
getting most of it. In Pacific's case that means more than 80 per cent. The
two drivers, David Coulthard and Michael Bartels from Germany, have raised
money from British and German companies including Crooks Healthcare,
Highland Spring and RH Allurad, a German wheelmaker.
So what happens if teams like Pacific fail to raise all the money they need
for the season? A favoured route is for teams to replace drivers in
mid-season with new drivers who can bring in additional finance. Cars can
appear for the second half of the season with a new driver and even in a new
sponsor's livery. Failing that the team can be forced to withdraw, which is
by no means unknown, especially in the present economic climate.
The life of a F3000 driver, who is generally in his early or mid-20s, is
clearly not an easy one. Apart from driving, he has to raise most of his
team's money. The personal financial rewards, meanwhile, are strictly
limited. The top drivers may earn in the region of Pounds 50,000-Pounds
70,000, but most earn closer to Pounds 30,000, all paid directly by the
sponsors. The lure for them is the promise of a career in F1.
So what about television? The rights, as for F1, are held by F1
Constructors' Association and its boss, Bernie Ecclestone. Ecclestone has,
it would appear, always been disinclined to give F3000 the boost it needs,
perhaps for fear of detracting from the golden egg, F1. At the moment his
worries are well-founded. With F1 a dull and predictable procession, the
crowds at this season's European grand prix meetings have been down and no
doubt this is also reflected in television audiences.
Meanwhile, the British touring car championship is busy demonstrating that
F1 need not have a monopoly of the big crowds. At the meeting last Monday at
Snetterton near Thetford, a record crowd of over 20,000 crammed into the
circuit. Last year, a similar meeting at Brands Hatch attracted nearly
50,000. There is no substitute for the power of television in modern sport.

round with a millionaire club owner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE CAR pulled up slowly and carefully at the crest of a hill and two men
clambered out eagerly. In front of them was a patch of earth, smooth and
flat - a tee, clearly, but one without any grass. The land plunged violently
downhill to a pond ringed with wooden stakes. Beyond lay the green, slim and
enticing and tilted slightly from back to front.
'Welcome to the 12th hole,' said Masao Nagahara. 'What club would you like?
It is 180 yards to carry the water. The wind is following. I think it is a
five wood or maybe a three iron. I lose many balls on this hole.'
This was the scene at the London Golf Club last Tuesday morning. Wherever
you looked there were men at work, raking, digging, hoe-ing, smoothing,
finishing. The concrete cart paths, eyesores on any course, reflected the
May sunshine. Far away in the distance, near where a gentle snore rose from
the traffic on the M20 motorway, a gang of men picked up stones.
I took the five wood and tucked my tie into my shirt. 'This is how Harry
Vardon, Ted Ray and Francis Ouimet dressed when they played off for the 1913
US Open,' I said. Nagahara giggled. He giggled a lot. He was entitled to. It
was his course, his club, his ball. The whole shooting match as far as the
eye could see was his. My shot flew over the water and the green before
thudding into the retaining bank.
'Congratulations,' said Nagahara, grinning. 'You are the first journalist to
carry the water at this hole.'
The London Golf Club, which sprawls over more than 600 acres near Wrotham in
Kent, will open in September. It has two courses, one designed by Jack
Nicklaus personally, the other by Ron Kirby, an employee. At a conservative
estimate of Pounds 30m, it is the most expensive new club in Britain.
But if anyone can afford it, Nagahara can. He earned his money by buying
land around Tokyo. As the city expanded, so sold at ever-increasing profits.
First he endowed a foundation in Osaka, the Osaka Sports College. Then, he
endowed himself.
'This country is the home of golf,' he said. 'I thought to myself: I will
build a golf course in Britain. Golf and life are very similar. They both
have many dramas. When you play 18 holes, you have 18 stories.'
A stocky man with the forearms of a stevedore, he is besotted by golf. As he
piloted a Nissan saloon car around the site of his creation last Tuesday, he
was asked if he knew the old joke about Nicklaus: 'He was given an unlimited
budget to build a golf course and he exceeded it.'
Nagahara laughed so much, he almost choked. 'Jack Nicklaus is the best,' he
said. 'He is known for that. I knew he was expensive but he is best.' He
giggled again. 'I am proud. This course is all paid for. There is no
mortgage.'
The London Golf Club might be the most expensive Japanese golf venture in
Britain (and perhaps outside Japan) but it is by no means the only one.
Since the mid-1980s, when their economy was booming, the Japanese have had
both a yen to spend and the yen to do it. Hitoshi Matsuura bought the
Turnberry hotel and golf club in Scotland sight unseen.
'As long as I have been building and running golf courses in Japan, I have
always wanted to own a course in the home of golf as well,' said Matsuura.
'Everybody in Japan has heard of Turnberry.'
Before this, Zenya Hamada had bought the Old Thorns club near Liphook,
Hampshire, before selling it on to London Kosaido, the London subsidiary of
a Japanese printing group. The Buckinghamshire, owned by Asahi Breweries, is
in operation near Denham, and The Oxfordshire, a lavish club built near
Thame by Matsuura's Nitto Albion Company, will open this summer.
This move into golf in Britain by the Japanese was part an investment and
part a reaction to the prejudice against them that exists at many British
clubs. For years, the Japanese had been one of golf's under-classes, like
women and Jews, victims of racial prejudice. The Jews overcame the prejudice
that was shown to them by building their own clubs: Dyrham Park and
Hartsbourne in the London area and Moor Allerton near Leeds. Now, the
Japanese are doing the same.
At the London Golf Club, the aim is for 70 per cent British, 10 per cent
international overseas members - and the rest Japanese. The clubhouse
contains western-style showers and Japanese o-furo baths as well as a spike
bar and a Japanese restaurant.
Nagahara himself is as westernised as he could be. At lunch at a local pub,
he drank a lager to wash down hamburger and chips doused in tomato sauce and
mayonnaise. Before taking me around his course, he donned a golf cap, put a
camera around his neck and said: 'Now, I am typical Japanese tourist.'
Later, he insisted on taking my picture outside the handsome clubhouse.
Even Japanese money, however, must bow to British traditions. A public
footpath passes through the site of the London Golf Club and no amount of
money could divert it. 'Sometimes, we Japanese do not understand the
British,' said Nagahara, clearly puzzled.
We drove through a glade thick with bluebells. 'Smell them,' commanded
Nagahara. 'They are beautiful.' We visited the manor house, sadly in decay
but soon to be renovated, with the oldest apple tree in Kent in its garden.
Masao Nagahara looked around at all the beauty that Kent, one of England's
most bounteous counties, could lay at his feet. 'May in England is a
wonderful month,' he said.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Sport: New York's hard-nosed heroes - Basketball
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECENT New York Knicks' basketball games at Madison Square Garden have been
a bit like a night at the Oscars, so hungry has Hollywood-on-the-Hudson been
to associate itself with the best sports story in town.
In recent weeks, Jack, Dusty, Woody, Spike and Arnold have all been there,
tasting the special atmosphere that New York generates every time it looks
as if one of the city's teams is on the verge of greatness. When the
baseball Mets won the World Series in 1986, New York went berserk, as it did
the last time the Knicks won a championship, in 1973.
Yet since the mid-1980s, New York sports fans have had little to cheer. The
football Giants won the SuperBowl in 1991, but the title was earned against
the backdrop of the Gulf War, so celebrations were muted.
This year, however, the Knicks have captured the city's imagination. In the
regular season they won 60 of their 82 games, ending with the second best
record in the 27-team National Basketball Association.
To success-starved New Yorkers, the Knicks' performance has been especially
gratifying because it was only two years ago that the team seemed mired in
mediocrity.
In 1991 they scraped into the playoffs, only to go out at the first attempt
to the Chicago Bulls in three straight games. That poor effort disgusted the
fans and the local media. The season ended in complete disarray. The coach
lacked the support of his team and the Knicks' only star, Patrick Ewing,
wanted to escape New York.
Yet, just two years later, the Knicks are fancied to reach the play-off
finals. They have beaten the Indiana Pacers in the first round and start
their second-round series against the Charlotte Hornets tomorrow.
Much of the credit for the Knicks' renaissance must go to Pat Riley, the
team's coach. In the 1980s Riley coached the Los Angeles Lakers to five NBA
titles, but when he joined the Knicks at the start of the 1991-92 season
there were many who still believed he had not proved himself.
Critics argued that the Lakers were so good that it did not matter who
coached them. They said that a team led by legends like Kareem Abdul Jabbar
and Earvin 'Magic' Johnson would have won five championships if they had
been coached by Michael Jackson. In the Knicks, Riley saw an opportunity to
win the respect that was denied him in California.
Today, Riley has triumphed, and with a team that could not be more different
to his title-winners of the 1980s. The Lakers dominated through deft
ball-handling and passing, and swift counter-attacks. They were adored by
their fans in Los Angeles, who liked to think that the team played the game
the way they lived - creative, fast and loose.
The Knicks' have won the hearts of their city because their approach meshes
closely with New Yorkers' image of themselves - hardworking, tough and
uncompromising.
Above all, the Knicks' game is built around big men, aggressive defending,
and an intimidating attitude that occasionally borders on thuggery.
Their bruising style has made the Knicks the most feared team in the league,
and hugely popular in New York. It is not surprising that the fans'
favourites this year have been Anthony Mason and John Starks, two ferocious
competitors whose intensely physical play causes havoc when they defend, and
creates scoring opportunities when the ball moves up court.
The dark side of streetfighters like Mason and Starks sometimes surfaces.
The Knicks' have a poor disciplinary record. On Tuesday Starks was thrown
out of a play-off game for head-butting Reggie Miller of the Pacers.
The other New York weapons include the dominant presence under the basket
and the accurate shooting (especially under pressure) of Ewing, the canny
generalship of point guard Doc Rivers and the strongest substitutes' bench
in the NBA. Add Riley's long experience of post-season play, and the Knicks
look as if they have the ingredients for a championship.
Yet, over such a long haul - the playoffs do not end until June and the
final three rounds involve a best-of-seven series - it may come down to
which team is hungriest for the title.
After consecutive championships, Chicago's appetite may be sated. The best
teams in the western division - Phoenix and Seattle - have the talent, but
there are doubts over their willingness to mix it up with the toughest teams
from the east.
Furthermore, the Knicks are desperate to win. Ewing, who has won national
college championships and Olympic gold, has said he will not feel fulfilled
until he wins an NBA title. Veterans such as Rolando Blackman and Rivers
know this may be their last shot at glory, and Riley wants to prove he can
win it all with a team other than the Lakers.
As for Mason and Starks, they have reached the top the hard way - via the
basketball wilderness of semi-professional leagues, obscure European
leagues, and no-hope 10-day contracts with losing NBA teams. As Starks said
recently: 'Remember, I wasn't supposed to be in the pros. But once I got a
taste, I knew it was just a matter of time.'

FT  08 MAY 93 / Computing: Take account of your own needs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CARTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMONEST application for which small businesses buy a computer is
accounting.
If I have been brought in to install an accounts package I usually have a
discussion with the directors before we start. What financial information do
they expect from their new system?
'We hoped that perhaps we could use the computer to produce our own profit
and loss accounts and balance sheets. And instead of getting them just once
a year we could now get them quarterly or even monthly. This would give us
up-to-date financial information to run the business, as well as cut down on
the audit fee.'
Illusions such as this are commonplace.
Patiently, I explain to them the facts of life.
'Profit and loss accounts and balance sheets are a waste of time. They are
part of the statutory audit, which exists not for your benefit but for the
benefit of everyone outside the company. For the taxman, to help him work
out your tax bill. For your bank manager, to assure him that his loan is
safe. For your accountant, to maintain him in the style to which he is
accustomed. Profit and loss accounts and balance sheets are nothing whatever
to do with you. Your job is simply to pay the bill.'
Few businessmen understand the balance sheet; if they did, they would
realise that as an aid to running the company it is useless. The profit and
loss account may seem more useful, but as far as the audit is concerned it
is there simply to explain how this year's balance sheet differs from last
year's. It has nothing to do with providing financial information to
management.
The distinction, in fact, is between financial accounting and management
accounting. If you go into a big company, you will find dozens of
accountants, but only two or three will be financial accountants. The
majority will be management accountants. By contrast, in the world of small
business the only accountants we have are financial accountants, who live
and breathe balance sheets and P &amp; L accounts.
Management accounting, as its name suggests, is designed to provide managers
with financial information to run their business. How do you produce your
own management accounts? Your first step is to work out how much you have to
pay out each month even if you make no sales at all.
Most of these 'overheads' do not change from month to month (wages, rent,
rates, lease charges etc) so they are easy to calculate; you can do it on
the back of an envelope. Suppose you work out that you have to pay Pounds
10,000 every month in these fixed costs. This means you are going to have to
earn at least Pounds 10,000 in margin each month in order to break even.
Margin, also called 'gross profit', equals sales value less cost of sales.
How you work out your margin differs from industry to industry.
In a 'trading' company, that is, one that buys products and resells them, it
is best done by a Sales Invoicing package. So, if this month you have sold
and invoiced 1,000 of Product X at Pounds 15 each, and you bought them for
Pounds 5 each, you have earned Pounds 10,000 margin.
If my clients run a trading company, I always try to start them off with an
invoicing package rather than a conventional set of accounting ledgers.
Look at the benefits. The computer produces all the invoices with ease; most
of the details required for the invoice such as customer name and address,
product description and selling price, are held permanently on the
computer's files. All you have to do is to enter the customer code, the
product code and the quantity being invoiced, and the computer does the
rest.
Once the invoice has been printed, it is automatically posted to the
customer's account on the Sales Ledger so you have completely up to date
information on how much your customers owe you. Because the computer holds
both the selling price and the cost price of each product, it can
automatically work out the cost value and therefore the profit earned on
each invoice. It uses this to build up histories of sales and margin earned
each month, sales and margin earned by each customer, sales and margin
earned by each product, and even sales and margin earned by each supplier
(invaluable data this when you are negotiating annual prices and volume
discounts with your suppliers).
To be of real value, management information has to be up to date. This is
another advantage of using an invoicing package. It will give you a report
of the sales and margin earned in month one by 10 am of the first day of
month two. No need to close the factory for half a day for a physical
stocktake, then hang around for another three weeks until all the purchase
invoices have arrived in the post, as you must with a conventional profit
and loss account.
The potential benefits of an invoicing package are enormous, and the
wonderful thing is that there is no need to get involved in debits and
credits, accruals and prepayments, or any of the paraphernalia of
accounting.
But the computer industry is as ignorant of this potential as anyone else.
In particular, I have found it difficult to find an invoicing package which
will give a completely reliable margin figure.
One package that does and which I would recommend strongly to the small
business without formal accounts staff, is Cornix Invoicing. The designer
has both a wealth of industry experience and a firm grasp of what an
invoicing package can do.
Do not be put off by the initial setup which is fiddly. As I used this
package I became more and more impressed. Although it costs only Pounds 89,
I would say that for all-round features and flexibility Cornix Invoicing is
perhaps the best invoicing package on the market at any price.
Cornix Invoicing costs Pounds 89 plus VAT from Cornix Computers, Roisia

FT  08 MAY 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Skiing without tears for
Anglophones in the Alps - A business that has found a niche on the ski
slopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HEATHER FARMBROUGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN YOU are young and single and learning to ski, it does not matter what
your ski instructor says to you as long as he is young, good-looking and
skis like a dream.
There comes a point, though, when you realise that you need some good
lessons. But good, affordable teaching in English in the Alps is scarce.
That is a niche filled by Sue and Kenny Dickson, their partner Alan Hole and
their school, Ski Masterclass.
Two years ago, Sue and Kenny were offering private lessons in Aviemore. Like
Alan, they have been qualified ski instructors for 25 years and taught
mostly in the UK. They met in St Anton in 1991 where, Sue says, they 'all
had the same idea at once': setting up an English-language school in the
Alps. For Sue and Kenny, it was the perfect time to go abroad, their three
children had grown up and left home.
They decided on Courchevel 1850 where Alan had worked briefly the previous
year. It has, Sue says, 'ideal teaching terrain'. Courchevel offers a vast
skiing area at high altitude and is popular with British skiers.
In spring 1991 they gained the French instructors' diploma. They started
teaching in December but without the priority access to ski-lifts and free
lift passes enjoyed by instructors from the Ecole de ski Francais.
The business cost little to set up. The three rented flats for the season
and bought matching ski suits. They sold lessons from the reception area of
the Ski Lodge, a hotel in Courchevel 1850 run by the British tour company
Ski Activity, mostly to Ski Activity's clients.
The three also visited other tour operators' chalets on Saturday evenings
and Sunday mornings to fill spare places. Classes were limited to eight
compared with a supposed maximum of 12 at the ESF.
There is no shortage of qualified ski instructors in France where there are
42 alternative ski schools in addition to the ESF. Outsiders find it
difficult to break into the local monopoly. The local mairie controls
concessions and looks after the interests of local businesses and ski
schools.
In Courchevel, Masterclass was competing with the ESF and Ski Cocktail, an
independent ski school. 'We took a lot of trade from both as neither had
British ski instructors,' says Alan.
Demand was so great that Masterclass needed more English-speaking
instructors. It also needed an office and a shop to rent out equipment and
to sell clothes from Kenny and Sue's shop in Aviemore.
At the end of the first season, Masterclass was approached by Wendy Parrott,
a former ski company rep, and her fiance Jean-Yves Lapeyrere, whose company
Wavehill International ran Ski Cocktail's ski schools and shops in
Courchevel, Meribel and Meribel-Mottaret. Ski Cocktail was struggling in
Courchevel. Lapeyrere offered to invest in Masterclass. This would entitle
Masterclass to the same same privileges as Ski Cocktail which had won equal
status with ESF after court actions by Lapeyrere against Meribel's mairie
and ski-lift company.
The five founded a holding company - Auld Alliance SA. Lapeyrere owns 51 per
cent of the shares, but Alan, Sue and Kenny are in charge and enjoy better
administrative back-up and more capital. They call themselves Ski
Masterclass.
Wendy, who is a shareholder, runs the shop, rented for FFr100,000, (Pounds
12,500) close to the main lift station. 'Having to buy all the equipment for
the shop from scratch was a bit of a shock,' says Sue.
They had to buy far more equipment than they anticipated, ending up with 150
pairs of skis and bindings and 100 pairs of boots. They expect to spend
FFr170,000 a year on replacing equipment. Equipment rental should bring in
about FFr450,000.
This season a fourth instructor Dave Renoulf and a full-time equipment
technician joined. Most bookings come through the shop, but on Saturday and
Sunday the instructors still go to the Ski Lodge and to Courchevel 1650 to
take bookings, communicating frantically with Wendy in the shop over a
walkie-talkie.
Masterclass offers five different two hour group classes for adults at
FFr600. 'It's more expensive than the ESF, but we teach in English and only
have eight in a group,' says Alan. Private tuition costs FFr400 for the
first person and FFr200 per extra person up to a maximum of four people.
This season, Masterclass is turning clients away and lessons should bring in
some FFr750,000 which is on target.
Sue believes that Masterclass has been too small to be affected by the
recession, but admits people are buying less ski-wear than she had hoped.
Kenny says the aim is to grow the business through off-piste courses, race
camps, touring and children's classes. The main problem is finding British
instructors qualified to teach in France. However, he expects a standard
European qualification to be implemented from May 1993, which would allow
more British instructors to teach.
It is a relatively straightforward business and there have been few
problems. All the instructors apart from Kenny - who is trying valiantly -
speak fluent French and relations with the local ESF are good.
Masterclass has full third party insurance cover: an instructor's worst
nightmare is causing injury to a client. Judging from the lessons I
attended, it seems more likely to be the other way round.
Total turnover for the 17 week trading period is expected to FFr1.2m. After
salaries have been paid, it does not leave a lot but, as Sue says, 'it's
comfortable'. The environment is one compensation. As one of the instructors
said, gesturing at the mountains basking in the sunlight, 'this is my
office.'

FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: How NI offers scope to save
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNIE HAWTHORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCOME tax-payers spend a lot of time and effort on ways to reduce their
bills. National Insurance contributions are also a compulsory levy on
earnings but, unlike the tax system, only rarely are they considered an area
where financial planning reaps any reward. Yet changing the method of
payment can bring significant gains for casual workers such as those in
temporary or part-time employment; those in agriculture and similar seasonal
employment; and students doing vacation work.
NICs are paid on a rising percentage scale between two earning levels. The
lower one equates roughly with the basic state pension and is now Pounds 56
a week, or Pounds 243 monthly, or Pounds 2,912 yearly. The upper is around
7.5 times the basic pension and is now Pounds 420 weekly, or Pounds 1,820
monthly, or Pounds 21,840 yearly.
Unlike income tax, which is based on a yearly cumulative total, with high
earnings balancing out lower ones to give the overall liability, NICs are
payable on an amount fixed in advance on the 'earnings periods' - whatever
they may be.
Not having to pay income tax does not absolve you from NICs on relevant
earnings. Thus, students working in vacation periods may get income tax
exemption through P38(S), but will still have to pay NICs in any periods
when their income exceeds the lower earnings level.
Earning periods normally are determined by the dates on which wages are paid
(or are due to be paid), and not for the periods during which the work
actually was done. So, if you contract to do four weeks' work at Pounds 56 a
week, you have exceeded the lower earnings level and will have to pay Pounds
1.12 NICs each week. Work a month for Pounds 240 and you pay no NICs because
that monthly figure is below the lower earnings level of Pounds 243 a month.
This principle applies all the way up the scale, and means that careful
timing can drop NICs into lower rate bands or below the lower earnings level
altogether.
A salary of Pounds 600 a week for four weeks' work results. for example, in
four NICs of either Pounds 27.33 or Pounds 33.88 weekly for that period
(depending on whether the firm which employs you is contracted in or out).
If you were paid monthly, though, you would be liable for only one NIC.
Similarly, six months' work at rates above the lower earnings level, paid at
weekly intervals, would mean 25-26 NICs. But care must be taken not to
breach the anti-avoidance regulations which ensure that NICs are not evaded
or reduced by abnormal practices such as uneven or irregular payments.
However, these are not likely to be applied for casual work.
Where a person has different jobs with different but associated employers,
the department of social security contributions agency aggregates these sums
so that employees do not pay NICs at lower rates. Teachers doing part-time
work for a local authority for a couple of evenings a week can be caught out
by this 'aggregation' principle; but those working odd sessions for a
private establishment might be viewed more favourably.
Paying less in NICs, or none, could reduce your entitlement to state
benefits including those for maternity, unemployment and sickness, and the
state pension. Most have high entry requirements in any case and a short
term reduction in NIC payments may not make too much difference to your long
term entitlements. But this is a factor to check.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Am I wasting my money?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE AGE of 35, I have settled in Britain and, being self-employed, have
begun paying NI Class 2 and Class 4 contributions. Because, at my age,
insufficient working years remain to qualify for a full state pension, my
contributions seem to be expended without benefit. Can any of the obligatory
NI contributions be redirected into my personal pension plan? Alternatively,
should I consider paying voluntary Class 3 contributions to secure some
benefit?
If you are paying Class 2 and Class 4 contributions as a self-employed
person, you cannot at the same time pay voluntary Class 3 contributions in
order to enhance your social security pension. Neither (as you suggest) can
you divert any of your Class 2 or 4 contributions (which you have to
consider as a tax) into a personal pension plan. If you want to provide
yourself with a reasonable retirement pension, then you are strongly advised
to pay contributions to a personal pension plan in addition to your
compulsory contributions to state social security.
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM BEING made redundant and am taking early retirement after 26 years'
pensionable service. I might then work as a part-time consultant. As a
higher-rate taxpayer, can I start another pension plan? If so, what
percentage of my earnings can I place in it?
The contributions that you can pay to a personal pension policy in respect
of your present and future non-pensionable earnings (eg. consultancy work)

COULD YOU tell me the relevant income figure to be taken into account when
calculating the maximum pension contribution? I am particularly concerned
about whether to make additional voluntary contributions. I had understood
that the relevant figure was the taxable salary in the final year of
employment. I now hear that it is the gross figure comprising the salary
plus the value of additional benefits such as a company car, health
insurance, and any other allowances paid by the employer.
The taxable value of your benefits in kind, such as company car and Bupa
premiums paid by your employer, can be added to your salary for the purposes
of calculating your pensionable remuneration. You mention the final year of
employment. There are many situations where fluctuating earnings, or the
level of salary, require pensionable remuneration to be based on the average
of the best three consecutive years in the last 13, but with the allowance
for each year's remuneration to be uplifted between the year it was received
and the date of retirement in line with increases in the retail price index
during the same period.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Gift from grandmother
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM a 19-year-old student at university and live with my parents during the
holidays. My grandmother, who is 82, seems determined to give me her house
(value Pounds 65,000) in the near future, although she would continue to
live there.
Would capital gains tax be charged on any appreciation in value from the
date of the gift to when it is eventually sold on my grandmother's death? (I
doubt if I will ever live there). Second, how does she transfer ownership to
me?
If the house is never your main residence (in fact or by designation), there
will be a CGT liability on its eventual sale if the sale proceeds exceed the
market value on the day of the gift by more than the rise in the retail
price index, subject to the exempt amount for the tax year of the sale (if
you have no other capital gains in that tax year).
But if you can conveniently live in the house for a short time - either
during your grandmother's lifetime or afterwards - it should be possible to
make a substantial reduction in the potential CGT bill by means of notices
under section 222(5)(a) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992.
Your grandmother will need the assistance of a solicitor in conveying the
house to you.
Ask a tax office for the free pamphlets CGT4 (Owner-occupied houses) and
CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an introduction).

FT  08 MAY 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Letting property brings problems
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE ALWAYS managed my own tax affairs without using an accountant. But
this tax year I have started to let property and things are getting
complicated] Can you recommend a good guide or book that covers the tax
treatment of property?
The solicitor who prepared the letting agreements for you is, of course,
best placed to guide you through the consequent tax labyrinth. But you might
ask your tax office for the following free pamphlets: IR87 - Rooms to let:
income from letting property; CGT4 - Owner-occupied houses; CGT14 - Capital
gains tax: an introduction; and CGT16 - Indexation allowance: disposals
after 5 April 1988. You could also write to the Inland Revenue Public
Enquiry Room, Somerset House, Strand, London WC2R 1LB, and ask for a copy of
Statement of Practice D24 (Capital gains tax: initial repairs to property).
We take it that the property is all within the UK and that it is being let
unfurnished, so that the rents are assessable entirely under Schedule A. If
either of those assumptions is wrong, the position will be a little more
complex.
It could be worth spending half-an-hour or so in a local reference library
looking at the relevant parts of any of the standard works on income tax and
capital gains tax.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Where tradition still plays its part -
Investment Trusts / Philip Coggan finds the old and the new in tandem at
Merchants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a strong sense of tradition about the Merchants Trust. It was
founded in 1889 with some famous City names on the original board including
a Baring, a Benson and a Hambro. Price Waterhouse was appointed auditor at
launch, and remains in that role.
As with many other 19th century trusts, the original idea was to invest in
overseas fixed-interest securities which offered a higher yield than
anything available in the UK. Over the years, Merchants moved gradually into
equity investments.
In 1984, it switched from being an international generalist, to its present
strategy of providing 'an above-average level of income and income growth
together with long-term growth of capital.' At the time, many trusts were
seeking to differentiate themselves so they could justify their continued
existence.
The change in aims is illustrated amply by the details of Merchants'
geographical spread. In January 1984, just 47.2 per cent of the portfolio
was in the UK, with 37.5 per cent in north America and the rest in the Far
East and Europe. By end-January 1993, the UK portion made up 99.1 per cent
of the portfolio with the rump in US unquoted stocks (which are being sold
off gradually).
This switch to the domestic market has, of course, been of immense help in
allowing the trust to increase its dividend from 2.4p in 1983/4 to 10.6p in
1992/3. UK equities traditionally offer a higher dividend yield than that
obtained by overseas markets - and the 1980s also saw strong dividend growth
in the UK.
Although the 1990s have seen many cuts in corporate dividends, the trust
says it has built up revenue reserves high enough to see out the storm.
According to manager Nigel Lanning, Merchants could pay out half last year's
dividend from these.
Lanning says the investment policy follows a yield discipline, with shares
being bought on high yields and low price-earnings ratios and sold if the
yield falls or the p/e rises too far. This philosophy is remarkably akin to
that of David Hopkinson, a former investment guru at M&amp;G - who just happens
to be one of the directors.
Such a strategy worked very well in the 1980s but struggled during 1991 and
1992. The net asset value of the trust rose just 4.3 per cent over the three
years from end-January 1990 to end January 1993. During the recession, high
yield once more became synonymous with high risk. But since the pound left
the exchange rate mechanism in September, lower interest rates and the
prospect of economic recovery have revived the high-yielding sector.
The yield on the trust is now 5.6 per cent which, says Merchants, is the
highest of its direct competitors (although Finstat's list of the UK income
growth sector puts the packaged units of M&amp;G income ahead, at 6.2). But
Lanning says it is able to offer this return without straying into the
wilder fringes of the high-yield sector. The trust receives some boost to
its income from around Pounds 10.6m of fixed-interest stock; it also has
fixed-interest debt, namely, some Pounds 25m of stepped-rate loans.
The 10 biggest stocks in the portfolio at end-January include many names
familiar to private investors: BAT, British Gas, BT, National Westminster,
Shell, Eastern Electricity, North West Water, Prudential, Great Universal
Stores and Allied-Lyons.
The high yield has been successful in attracting private investors, who now
own more than 50 per cent of Merchants. Accordingly, the discount has
narrowed, and the trust now trades virtually at asset value, so investors
are at risk from a return to the the days of wide discounts.
Merchants' record in its sector is moderate, with Finstat showing it as
below average over one, two and three years. It is fourth (out of 10) in the
sector over seven years, with growth of 163.6 per cent (mid-market to
mid-market with net income re-invested). But, as the graph shows, the trust
has marginally outperformed the All-Share over a 10-year period.
Peter Walls, investment trust analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, says: 'I
have never been particularly concerned or particularly excited by the
trust's management style. It is a steady fund which has been successful at
attracting private investors because of its high yield. But we are not going
to see the same kind of dividend growth as we did in the 1980s.'
Key facts
Gross assets of the trust are Pounds 280m and net assets Pounds 250m.
NatWest Securities estimated the net asset per share at 238.2p on April 6,
putting the shares, then 237p, on a discount of 0.5 per cent. The dividend
yield was 5.6 per cent. The management fee is 0.35 cent per annum of assets,
minus current liabilities and short-term loans.
Board
Merchants has a remarkably high-powered board. Non-executive directors are
Sir John Banham, former director-general of the CBI; Sir Derek Birkin,
chairman of RTZ; David Hopkinson, former managing director of M&amp;G Group; Sir
Thomas Risk, a former governor of the Bank of Scotland; and Sir Anthony
Tuke, former chairman of Barclays Bank. Colin Black, the chairman of
Scottish Widows, is about to take over as chairman from Robert Henderson,
who is retiring.
Savings scheme
and Pep details
The minimum monthly investment in the savings scheme is Pounds 25, or Pounds
250 for lump sums. Investments of more than Pounds 1,000 will be dealt-with
on the following day. There is an 0.5 per cent dealing charge and 0.5 per
cent for stamp duty.
The personal equity plan has a 3.5 per cent initial charge (2.5 per cent for
existing investors in the trust) and a 1 per cent annual charge. The minimum
investment is Pounds 6,000 (or Pounds 3,000 if the allowance is split
between two Kleinwort trusts).
This is the last article about conventional investment trusts. A round-up of
the series will appear next week with the first in a new series on split
capital trusts.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Society calls for merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of the Warwick-based Heart of England building society, the UK's
25th biggest, are being called upon by their board to vote next month for a
proposed take-over by Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth largest. Heart of
England has been looking for a suitable partner after negotiations with the
Bank of Edinburgh fell through earlier this year.
Heart of England is just one of the smaller building societies that has
found it increasingly difficult to compete in a numerically well-served
industry. Although it has not been losing money, its pre-tax profits of
Pounds 1.6m (after bad debt provisions of Pounds 12.3m) for the year to
end-February were down on last year's pre-tax surplus of Pounds 2.3m.
Heart of England has 230,000 savers and 30,000 borrowers. In buoyant times,
members of a smaller society taken over by a larger one could look forward
to a bonus as compensation for transferring their ownership to another
society. Most importantly, though, a bonus is a payment arising from
equalising the level of the reserves between the two societies.
But, in this case, Heart of England's general reserve ratio, at 4.22 per
cent, is lower than C&amp;G's 4.54. So, C&amp;G says there are no 'excess' reserves
to be distributed as a bonus.
Instead, it is offering sweeteners to persuade Heart of England members to
stay put under the new management. One such is a guarantee to pay 0.25 of a
percentage point above Heart of England's rates on accounts which are open
to new investors for one year after the merger.
Heart of England customers will find, however, that interest rates at C&amp;G
generally are higher than they are getting now. The exceptions are their
Instant Gold and Tessa accounts.
The former pays 5.15 per cent gross on its top tier of Pounds 25,000
compared with 4.3 per cent gross on C&amp;G's Cheltenham Gold account. The Tessa
pays 7 per cent compared with C&amp;G's top Tessa rate of 6.85 per cent.
If the merger is agreed, it is expected to go through on October 1.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pensions alert over spread of
'churning' - The needless switching of investments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHURNING, or unnecessary switching of investments to generate commission,
appears to be spreading in the pensions market. One large firm of investment
advisers, asked for a second opinion about pensions advice given by a
competitor, was so alarmed that it reported the matter to the Financial
Intermediaries, Managers and Brokers Regulatory Association (Fimbra), the
self-regulatory body for financial advisers.
The query came from a man made redundant two years ago who was advised at
that time to transfer his preserved company pension into a personal pension
policy. Several weeks ago, the broker which arranged the transfer sent a
circular recommendation encouraging the man to switch his pension from the
managed fund run by an insurance company into the broker's own fund.
The adviser giving the second opinion said: 'It looks like an assembly line
job. The paperwork is of a very poor standard and there is hardly any
justification for the recommendation at all, apart from the expectation that
their own broker fund will perform better than the insurance company's fund,
based on past performance of just six months.'
Although the adviser suggested that the recommendation might have come from
a rogue individual within the particular firm, he considered it worth
telling Fimbra that the material appeared to be part of a sizeable mailing.
Fimbra refused to confirm it had received the adviser's report and said any
possible disciplinary action was not for public discussion. It added: 'Any
problem will have to be rectified by the member and, if it is not, they will
be suspended from doing any investment business.'
At the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Organisation (Lautro), a spokesman said
that suggesting a switch into a broker bond might be a legitimate option
providing investors were made aware of all costs and charges involved. But
he stressed that Lautro would not take kindly to over-emphasis of short-term
performance, such as a six-month record. The organisation insists on the use
of figures covering at least five years, where these exist.
Another form of churning most unlikely to be reported to investment
watchdogs involves collusion between adviser and client to raid the
accumulated pension.
Industry sources say churning of personal pensions has focused on the
cash-generating opportunities. Brokers can offer to share 4-5 per cent
commission with a policyholder each time the accumulated transfer value of
the pension is moved from one life company to another.
This might seem insignificant but, even at middle management level, transfer
values of Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 200,000 are not uncommon. Furthermore,
commission levels in regular premium contracts are about 12 times the single
premium rate. So, a Pounds 20,000 pension contribution could 'free' Pounds
12,000 to be allocated between the broker and the client. Such strategies
would have to be concealed from watchdogs.
'The investor protection rules include a general obligation not to churn,
and it cannot be compatible with good advice or suitability,' says Mike
Wadsworth, of actuary Watsons. Life companies do not pay commission to an
intermediary unless it can recover this from the fund.
At some point during the life of the pension contract, the company will make
sure it gets back from the customer the 5 per cent or more paid out. In the
course of three or four moves from one company to another, the customer
would also have to meet charges for setting up policies. All this could mean
a significant reduction in the final value of the pension.
A higher-rate taxpayer might take the view that 75 per cent of his final
fund will be taxed at 40 per cent, whereas a rebate of commission from a
broker will be tax-free. But this is a mistake. Tax inspectors see rebated
commission as income, subject to tax.
Wadsworth says there might be tactical reasons for switching a pension from
one life company to another. For example, with a Section 32 buy-out policy,
there are strict limits on the maximum pension and lump sum that can be
taken out, with any surplus going to the life company.
'It is possible to play the system a bit,' adds Wadsworth, stressing that
his own firm is not involved . 'Churning can happen in pensions - and
sometimes does.'

FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Now for staggered vesting - The newest
slant in private pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST craze in private pensions is staggered vesting, a complex and
costly substitute for the simple purchase of an annuity to provide
retirement income.
Like most successful pension marketing campaigns, this is based on a concept
that offers genuine opportunities to a minority of investors - provided the
right fund management and ongoing expert advice is secured. Staggered
vesting, or phased retirement, involves taking benefits in stages rather
than all at once.
But investment regulators are worried that salesmen and independent advisers
are jumping on the bandwagon and marketing the concept inappropriately to
secure commission payments of up to five times those available on a one-off
annuity purchase.
To appreciate the opportunities and risks associated with staggered vesting,
it is necessary to understand the various pension options available at
retirement.
Employees in company schemes generally receive a pension linked to their
final salary, plus a tax-free lump sum. Those in group or individual money
purchase schemes - where the value of the pension depends on investment
returns - can take a tax-free cash lump sum usually worth 25 per cent of
their fund.
The residual fund must be used to buy an annuity from a life office.
Annuities come in various guises but, in return for a lump-sum investment,
the majority guarantees to pay a fixed income until the person taking out
the annuity dies.
Two main problems associated with annuities have led to the development of
phased retirement and staggered vesting. First, once you have paid your lump
sum, it is gone for good - even if you die the following day. Most providers
now offer annuities that return part of the fund if you die within five
years, but this option is secured at the expense of a lower annuity rate.
The second problem is flexibility. Once you have agreed the benefits - for
example, a fixed annuity, annual increases of 5 per cent and/or spouse's
pension - you cannot change your mind. Staggered vesting - and, to a lesser
extent, phased retirement - attempts to overcome these problems.
With phased retirement, the entire fund is not used to buy a single annuity.
Instead, investors can purchase, say, three separate annuities at ages 60,
65 and 70. This allows those who want to continue working part-time to live
off a combination of reduced earned income and a proportion of pension
income.
In addition, the residual fund left in the pension plan may continue to
benefit from investment growth. And buying annuities at a later date will
offer better value since rates are based on life expectancy, among other
factors. Annuity rates can and do fall, depending on the underlying rate of
inflation.
Staggered vesting is the hot-house version of phased retirement - a delicate
plant that needs careful nurture and is vulnerable to market forces. Under
it, the one-off annuity purchase is replaced by a series of annual
transactions.
Each year, part of the pension fund is used to provide an element of
tax-free cash and a small annuity, so allowing people to assess income needs
annually. This requirement is met by the combination of tax-free cash, the
annuity purchased with the current year's draw-down of funds, plus annuities
in force from previous years. Clearly, however, since the tax-free cash is
to form part of annual income, the large lump sums usually available at
retirement will not be an option.
As with phased retirement, the fund that remains invested can benefit from
continued growth. The residual fund also provides a high level of continued
life assurance since, provided the pension plan is written under trust, the
fund is passed on free of inheritance tax to your beneficiaries if you die.
Moreover, since annuity rates improve as your life expectancy decreases, the
amount you need to encash each year should in theory decrease in inverse
proportion to your age. But because of the complexity and the cost of the
arrangement, staggered vesting is not considered suitable for those with
less than Pounds 100,000 to invest and, ideally, they should have another
source of retirement income because of the higher risks involved.
Viewed in isolation the concept is extremely imaginative but pension
regulators are concerned that staggered vesting offers providers and
intermediaries a back entrance to the lucrative and controversial transfer
market.
Staggered vesting can be carried out only via a unit- linked, segmented
personal pension. Typically, the pension must be split into segments of
Pounds 1,000 so that, each year, the appropriate proportion of the fund can
be drawn down to provide the necessary income. Under a personal pension, it
is possible to draw the pension at any time between the age of 50 and 75.
Personal pensions have been around only since 1988, so most investors coming
up to retirement are likely to have a retirement annuity contract (the
precursor to the personal pension), an executive pension plan, or some form
of occupational scheme. The first step towards staggered vesting then is to
transfer the benefits built up under existing arrangements to a personal
plan.
And therein lies the rub. On a single annuity purchase, providers tend to
pay the intermediary between 1-1.5 per cent of the fund's value. Transfers,
however, are classed as single premium business and, as such, pay commission
of around 5.2 per cent. Given the target market for this product of
individuals with funds worth Pounds 100,000, the difference for the
intermediary lies between earning around Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 5,000.
In addition to the initial transfer commission, the intermediary also is
paid an annual fee of about 0.25 per cent of the fund, on top of which is
the 1-1.3 per cent of the fund paid for the annual purchase of the annuity.
All of which comes out of your hard-earned pension investment.
Last week, the Life Association of Scotland (LAS) launched its own version
of staggered vesting, backed up by a computer software package for its own
tied agents which can be leased by independent advisers. LAS follows Sun
Life, Provident Life and Clerical Medical, all of which have homed in on
this developing market.
But however good - or bad - the underlying pension product, it is the work
of the intermediary that is critical in staggered vesting. Some of the
specialist pensions advisers offer considerable expertise and are prepared
to rebate a significant chunk of the transfer commission to the client.
Independent advice is essential in selecting the best personal pension plan
for transfer, and the best annuity rates on an annual basis.
Moreover, staggered vesting has wider implications for the pensions market
as a whole. There is a strong case for viewing pensions as a form of
insurance, rather than as an investment vehicle. Standard annuities operate
on this principle.
If a significant proportion of annuity-holders fund their annual income
through staggered vesting, this will skew the terms on which providers are
able to offer annuity rates to the detriment of the majority.
Most people are served best by a guaranteed retirement income. Where there
are surplus funds, these can be invested separately. Products designed to
combine insurance and investment tend to benefit the life offices and
intermediaries, who build in extra charges carefully hidden by the
complexity of the product structure. In this respect staggered vesting is no
exception.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Bears rule in latest BT sale - But the
ursine share shop symbol could be misleading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POTENTIAL investors in the imminent sale of the government's third tranche
of British Telecommunications stock may find its share shop symbol a little
ominous: a bear is clutching the prospectus, with a bull nestling behind.
Certainly, the public must be made aware that the market for shares goes
down as well as up - hence the need for the services of the stock market's
two best-known animals. It is just unfortunate, according to one broker
acting in the sale, that the bear appears to be in a dominating position.
SG Warburg, the government's global co-ordinator for the issue, intends to
make sure the bull comes out on top. Warburg aims to prevent any
institutions from trying to depress the share price before the offer.
To ensure a stable market after the sale, it is prepared to buy back BT
shares if there is a need to stabilise the price.
The biggest advertising campaign so far to sell BT shares will start on May
25 and dealing will follow in mid-July. The government is expected to sell
most, if not all, of its remaining 22 per cent stake in BT - worth more than
Pounds 5bn at present prices.
As in previous offers, the shares will be sold in partly-paid form, with
investors settling their bills by instalments.
While only eight retailers were selected in 1991 when the second tranche in
BT was sold, more than 150 - including the big four clearing banks, building
societies and stockbrokers - will be taking part in this year's initiative.
Anyone interested in buying can still register with the share information
office, along the lines of previous government privatisations. But there are
two main advantages of registering with one of the share shops.
First, if there is strong demand for shares, people applying through the
shops will be given greater preference in allocation. Second, the shops are
expected to send information on their products and services, which may
include special cut-price deals, with the BT3 offer information.
As part of the government's initiative to widen and deepen share ownership,
ministers are hoping the share shop symbol will outlive the BT3 offer. It is
by no means certain they will succeed.
The National Audit Office, the parliamentary watchdog, raised doubts
recently about whether the government's special efforts in BT2 to boost the
number of long-term small investors had worked.
The NAO reached no judgment on the success of the share shop scheme -
intended to make it easier for small investors to deal - beyond noting that
59 per cent of the shops' transactions in the three-month special dealing
period after the sale were on behalf of individuals disposing of BT shares.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: It's good to be gross - Offshore bond
funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAIN attraction of offshore bond funds, particularly for non-taxpayers,
is that income is paid gross. This means that UK-resident non-taxpayers do
not need to reclaim tax from the Inland Revenue - something they would have
to do if they invested in an onshore bond fund, since these cannot pay
income gross.
Even resident UK citizens who are liable for tax may find offshore bond
funds attractive because the tax payment can be delayed.
The table lists those sterling offshore bond funds which are recognised by
the Securities and Investments Board - the chief regulator for the financial
services industry in the UK - and which have a three-year performance
record. SIB recognition should give some comfort to investors worried by the
memory of the Barlow Clowes debacle, as should the presence of many
well-known industry names in the table.
Figures have been taken from Finstat and show the top 10 performing
SIB-recognised funds in the sterling fixed-interest sector. They are quoted
on an offer-to-offer basis because some funds have a single price but add on
an initial charge. Were funds to be quoted on an offer-to-bid price, the
single-priced funds would receive an unfair advantage.
But the effect of quoting on an offer to offer basis, is that the
performance figures are better than the returns which would actually have
been achieved by an investor. Initial charges can be 5-6 per cent.
In addition, performance figures have been boosted by a very good market for
gilts, which have risen in price in response to falls in UK interest rates.
There is no guarantee that the illustrated levels of performance will
continue.
The highest-performing fund in the list - Barclays Sterling bond fund, with
a gross yield of 8.9 per cent - has an initial charge of 3.5 per cent with
an annual management fee of 0.85 per cent. The minimum investment is Pounds
1,000.
Investors who are new to the fixed interest sector should be aware that the
fund with highest yield is not necessarily the best. Bond funds can achieve
a high yield at the expense of declining capital.
For those who want further details, information on offshore funds can be
found in the Managed Funds pages at the back of the FT's first section.
This table appears as part of our regular service for fixed-income
investors. Next week, details of onshore sterling bond funds and the
permanent interest-bearing shares.

AS THE housing market shows signs of recovery, special mortgage offers from
building societies continue to proliferate.
Northern Rock is offering a discount of 3.01 per cent off its normal
mortgage rate, lasting until June 1994, where the loan is no more than 75
per cent of the property's value.
For loans up to 90 per cent of value, the discount is 2.01 per cent. This
results in current rates of 4.98 per cent and 5.98 per cent respectively.
Borrowers must take out buildings and contents insurance through Northern
Rock and pay an arrangement fee of Pounds 95.
The society also is offering fixed-rate mortgages of 6.95 per cent (8.1 per
cent APR) over two years; 7.45 per cent (8.1 per cent APR) over three years;
and 7.95 per cent (8.2 per cent APR) over five years. All of these loans are
portable.
Arrangement fees are between Pounds 200 and Pounds 250 and borrowers must
take out the society's buildings and contents insurance.
Britannia is offering a range of fixed-rate mortgages from two to 10 years.
The two-year rate is 7.5 per cent (8.4 per cent APR) for those with a 10 per
cent deposit.
Over five years, the rates vary from 7.99 per cent (8.5 per cent APR) for
those with a 40 per cent deposit to 8.8 per cent (8.9 per cent APR) to
someone with only a 5 per cent deposit. The rate over 10 years is 9.99 per
cent (10.2 per cent APR).
Arrangement fees vary from Pounds 150 on the two-year mortgage (not for
first-time buyers) to 0.75 per cent of the loan (with a minimum of Pounds
295) for the 10-year deal. All kinds of mortgages - including repayment -
are eligible under this offer.
Leeds &amp; Holbeck building society has launched a range of discounts on its
variable rates of 8.6 per cent and 8.7 per cent. The discounts vary from
2.26 per cent (on loans worth 90 per cent of the property) to 3.26 per cent
(on 70 per cent) - but they will last only until January next year.
Borrowers must pay a valuation fee linked to the value of the property, an
application fee of Pounds 150 - of which Pounds 50 is non-refundable - and
must also take out the society's buildings and contents insurance.
Norwich &amp; Peterborough is offering a one-year fix, with the rate at 4.95 per
cent for the first six months and 5.95 per cent for the following six. But
this requires an endowment or pension policy to be taken out for 50 per cent
of the mortgage advance.
Buildings and contents insurance must also be taken out through the society.
There is a Pounds 125 arrangement fee.
Other offers cited by Moneyfacts in its mortgage selection include a NatWest
home loans fix which is 8.99 per cent for 10 years, with an arrangement fee
of Pounds 250.
Capped rates mentioned by Moneyfacts include Bank of Ireland (5.75 per cent
to June 1 1994; arrangement fee Pounds 280), Coventry BS (7.25 per cent
until January 31 1995; arrangement fee Pounds 100) and Nationwide BS (7.85
per cent for three years; arrangement fee Pounds 295).
Those interested should check with the institutions for the terms and
conditions of these deals.
In its round-up of offers, John Charcol cites a Legal &amp; General deal which
for 7.49 per cent over five years (on loans below 75 per cent of valuation).
There is a Pounds 250 fee and compulsory buildings and contents insurance.
The offer is available on endowment, pensions and interest-only mortgages.

DESPITE continuing problems at its Australian subsidiary, shares in Admiral,
the computer services group, have outperformed the market by 25 per cent
over the past year. Clayton Brendish, the chairman, and Dr Ceri Jones, the
managing director, have sold 1,005,575 and 100,625 shares respectively at a
price of 420p, to leave them holding 2m and 420,000.
Philip Gwyn, a non-executive director of Alumasc, the group that designs and
manufactures products for the brewing and building industries, sold 196,000
shares at 525p to leave him holding about 6 per cent of the ordinary shares.
Last September, four of the directors of Shandwick, the public relations
consultancy group, bought large numbers of shares at prices between 2.75 and
5p. Among them was John Huckle, the finance director, who bought 615,384.
Last week he sold 350,000, at 19.5p.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The complex business of residence -
Expatriates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DONALD ELKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUDGET proposal by the chancellor of the exchequer to eliminate the
90-year-old 'available accommodation' rule has spotlighted the whole concept
of tax residence. What is its effect? And just how do you become, or cease
to be, resident?
Put briefly, residence - together with domicile, for which legislative
changes also are pending - determines the scope of your liability to UK tax.
There are, in fact, three important statuses - residence, ordinary residence
and domicile - none of which has a detailed statutory definition. This void
has, therefore, been filled by a mass of case law, Inland Revenue practice
and concession. This makes it difficult for the individual to know, without
seeking specialist advice, his precise situation in any particular set of
circumstances.
Even without the available accommodation rule, you can become resident:
By going to the UK for permanent residence or with the intention of staying
for at least three years.
By being in the country for more than 182 days in a tax year (ie, April
6-April 5).
By visiting the UK for periods which exceed 90 days a year on average over
any four consecutive tax years.
The first and third of these rules will make you ordinarily resident, too.
Domicile, by contrast, cannot be defined in such 'mechanical' terms since it
depends on so many disparate factors - such as where you were born, where
you have lived since, where your home(s) is situated, and the location of
your family, business and social contacts. Its essential purpose is to
connect individuals with the legal system in the country or state in which
they live permanently or indefinitely.
If you were born in the UK of British parents and have lived there all of
your life, clearly you will be resident, ordinarily resident and domiciled
there. As such, you will be liable to income tax and capital gains tax on
global income and gains. When you die, inheritance tax can be levied on your
estate by reference to world-wide assets.
Conversely, a person who was born and has lived all his life outside the UK
will have none of the three statuses. His exposure to British tax will be
limited to that on income derived there (and not even all of that) plus IHT
on UK assets so far as they exceed the exempt amount (at present, Pounds
150,000).
All this is simple enough. But it is when your life falls somewhere in
between these extremes that complications start to arise.
Say that you decide, after being a life-long British resident and
domiciliary, to take a job overseas. From the day after you leave the UK,
you will be regarded as not resident and not ordinarily resident - provided
your period of employment extends beyond a complete tax year and your visits
to the UK do not exceed six months in a year or 90 days a year on average.
Once that happens, liability to capital gains tax ceases altogether (with
the sole exception of gains arising from assets used in a UK business). Nor
need you pay tax on overseas income, even if you send it to the UK.
But most UK income remains taxable although there are some exceptions; for
example, the interest on holdings of British government securities. And most
British expatriates remain liable to pay IHT; only those emigrating
permanently escape this particular impost (but not until 36 months after
changing domicile).
Expatriates returning to the UK will face considerations that are very
largely the opposite of those explained above, but with the important
difference that their resources - and their problems - are likely to be
greater than when they left.
On the other hand, the treatment given to foreigners coming to the UK
temporarily - for, say, short-term employment - will be different again. For
while they might well become resident and ordinarily resident, typically,
they will keep their overseas domicile. They will be eligible for reduced
IHT and will not have to pay UK income tax and CGT on overseas income and
gains except for sums received in the UK.
Be warned, though. This is a complex area of the law where much can be
gained or lost, particularly when your position in the residence/domicile
spectrum changes. So, if you are planning such a move, specialist advice is
desirable.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Personal equity plans: how safe is
your money? - Shares in Peps are held in nominee companies which do not
neatly fit existing compensation rules, as Scheherazade Daneshkhu explains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERSONAL equity plans have become one of the more popular ways of investing,
partly because public interest in equities is reviving now that UK interest
rates have fallen and partly because of their much-advertised tax
efficiency.
A Pep allows investors to hold shares (or unit trusts) without paying income
or capital gains tax, subject to an annual investment limit of Pounds 6,000
in a general Pep but with the option of an additional Pounds 3,000 in a
single company Pep.
In order to get the tax break, Peps must be managed and administered by an
Inland Revenue-approved registered scheme manager. For this reason, the
Revenue does not allow shares held within a Pep to be registered solely in
the shareholder's name. Instead, most plan managers use a nominee company -
one formed specially to hold shares on behalf of a third party - to register
them.
Nominee services are not an authorised activity under the Financial Services
Act (FSA). This means that, technically, they fall outside the scope of the
investors' compensation scheme (ICS), which will pay up to Pounds 48,000 of
a loss when an authorised company or person defaults.
However, the Securities and Investments Board (SIB), the regulatory body for
the financial services industry, has said that stock held in a nominee name
usually will be eligible for compensation under the ICS rules. This is not a
legal obligation, though, and some readers have voiced concern about the
safety of their Peps. But Pep-holders probably are better off than other
investors with shares in a nominee account.
'The best reason for regarding nominee accounts as safe is that the
government regulations say that stock held in a Pep must be held by a
nominee,' says David Langshaw, from the Association of Private Client
Investment Managers and Stockbrokers.
The regulations also say that even though the shares must be registered in
the name of a nominee, the 'beneficial (or true) owner' is the investor, not
the nominee company. The Pep manager himself, as head of a Revenue-approved
body, has to be authorised under the FSA.
'The Pep manager has responsibility for the clients' money. If he were to go
under, the investor would be entitled to compensation through the authorised
entity,' says David Cresswell of SIB.
Pep-holders who are worried can take further measures to protect themselves.
Most managers operate a pooled nominee service where shares belonging to
investors are batched together for registration in the nominee company's
name. This is the only name that then appears on the stock exchange's
register.
Some plan managers - usually those running a self-select Pep, where the
investors choose their own stock - operate designated nominee accounts where
the shares are registered jointly in the name of the nominee company with a
specific account number or sets of initials which can be used to identify
the individual shareholder.
A further advantage for investors in a designated nominee account is that
they would receive the annual reports of those companies in which they have
shares.
Stockbrokers prefer pooled nominees, however, because of the ease of
administration. If, for example, a broker had 1,000 clients with ICI shares
in the name of a pooled nominee, there would only be one dividend cheque to
handle. With a designated nominee, the broker would have to administer 1,000
dividend cheques.
'I have no doubt that nominee accounts are robust although, it has to be
said, they have never been tested very seriously,' says Paul Killik, of
Killik &amp; Co., a stockbroker which runs designated nominee accounts for all
its Pep clients.
One test occurred in 1991 with the collapse of Diameter, a low-cost
stockbroker. The liquidators found that the firm had neglected to buy all
the shares for which its clients had placed instructions. These shares could
not be located in its nominee company.
Affected investors were compensated by the ICS on the ground that the
authorised company, Diameter Stockbrokers, was guilty of wrongdoing. So far,
483 such investors have been paid but the process has been lengthy.
This kind of delay is less likely to occur if the plan manager runs a
designated nominee account in which the shares and owners can be identified
readily. Investors cannot sell their shares until this reconciliation
process is over.
Managers running pooled accounts are required to keep up-to-date records
identifying all the investors and the shares they hold. Audits have to be
done every six months and the Securities and Futures Authority makes regular
spot checks.
If a Pep manager loses his status - which would happen automatically if he
became bankrupt or the business was wound up - investors have the right
either to transfer their plan to another manager or to close it.
'In the case of involuntary withdrawal or revocation of approval, the person
appointed to terminate the scheme should perform these duties,' says Martin
Dodd, of the Pep Managers' Association.
The Revenue says that if compensation is paid to investors under the ICS,
the money will be treated as a Pep transfer if it goes directly to a new
plan manager. In this way, the tax-free status of the money built up in the
Pep would not be jeopardised.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Artistic lifeline for Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITHIN THE next few weeks Lloyd's Names will receive a letter outlining the
size of their personal liability to the losses of their battered syndicates.
The word is that more people will be affected than last year, with a
shortfall in excess of Pounds 2.5bn to be gathered in by the early autumn.
In the last week many Names will have received another letter, this time
from Sotheby's, the London auction house, offering condolences and offers of
assistance.
Sotheby's first became involved with Lloyd's six years ago in a very
different financial climate. Then Names were flush with their gains and the
art market was booming. Some cheques from Lloyd's went towards acquiring
furniture, pictures, silver and the rest of life's luxuries. Sotheby's
suggested that works of art might be used as collateral by anyone interested
in accumulating the wealth needed to become a Name, or by Names keen to
build up their investment. Sotheby's would do a valuation and offer a
guarantee of up to 35 to 40 per cent of the estimated auction price of an
object. But only just over 40 people took up the offer and the scheme
languished.
Of course Sotheby's was mainly interested in getting Names to buy and sell
through its auction rooms. Around 1,200 Names are Sotheby's clients and they
are the first to be approached under this new marketing exercise. The
original scheme has been re-launched with refinements. Names who still want
to invest in Lloyd's can use their works of art as collateral, up to 35 per
cent of their value, to build up their investment, but this time Sotheby's
will offer to store the works in its warehouse, which cuts insurance and
other costs.
Sotheby's also suggests that immediate liabilities can be met by selling
works of art. Sotheby's will send a valuer, at no cost to the client, to
price a Name's antiques. If the money must be raised by October Sotheby's
can make an advance (at a price) on the works of art which it will auction
when it thinks the market is strongest.
The pressing problem in the art world at the moment is a lack of decent
antiques to sell. Names are already being forced to supply such goods: in
the good forthcoming furniture sales at Sotheby's this month some of the
best lots come from Names.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Cut the waffle, just tell me the price
 -SIB aims to reveal the true cost of investment products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAT A picture is worth a thousand words is the basic concept underlying the
latest plans to make it easier for investors to understand what they are
actually buying.
The Securities and Investments Board, the City of London's chief watchdog,
last week issued a consultant's report outlining proposals aimed at setting
an easy to comprehend price-tag on some of the most sophisticated products
consumers buy.
Tim Miller, the consultant, has proposed that instead of viewing complicated
tables showing expenses and projected returns, potential investors will be
shown a graph.
A graph for, say, a 25-year endowment would show the value of the policy in
each year of its life, assuming three things: first, that you continue all
premium payments; second, that you cash it in and suffer the effects of
charges and expenses; and third, what investment returns would look like if
there were no expenses and charges.
The difference between lines number two and three represents the price-tag.
This would clearly show that within the industry there are wide differences
in just how much each product actually costs.
The current SIB proposals on what people should be told before they buy a
product have many shortcomings, Miller argued.
Among these is the fact that the proposals, including the so-called 'key
features document' intended to set out charges for investors, contains 735
words. Miller claims that his charts will cut the number of words needed to
explain a complex product, such as a long-term endowment policy or a unit
trust, by as much as 75 per cent.
Miller, who is the former marketing director at M&amp;G Group, Britain's largest
manager of unit trusts, makes several proposals on how the costs of unit
trusts should be disclosed.
These will provide less initial information than has been previously
available and will eliminate the 14-day cooling off period during which
customers are allowed to cancel their contract without penalty. However,
Miller argues that investors will be compensated for this lack of
information in other ways.
Miller says that sales agents should be required to use 'forward pricing' in
charging the customers. That is the price per unit on the morning following
the sale agreement, rather than its price on the morning of the day on which
the sale is agreed.
Thus, if the stock market is surging, investors will pay more for their
units but will be protected against at least some losses in a falling
market.
He also suggests a formula which has been much debated in the unit trust
industry; that of showing investors a single price.
Under the current system, three prices are displayed; offer, bid and
cancellation. The difference between the offer price (at which investors
buy) and the bid price (at which investors sell) represents the cost to the
customer.
Miller says that any confusion on cost which may arise out of single pricing
is likely to allayed by his other proposal, which is to require companies to
provide each customer with a prospectus. This would apply to unit trust as
well as life insurance products and would spell out more clearly exactly
what the charges are.
Meanwhile, Miller considered but rejected two controversial proposals which
consumer groups have been pressing for in recent years.
He argues that both are essentially good ideas which would limit the sale of
products to investors for whom they are clearly unsuitable, but says that
there are practical difficulties with both.
The first is 'unbundling', the separation of the investment aspects of an
insurance product from the life protection element. Although products
frequently carry the appellation of insurance, in fact the life insurance
element makes up the smallest part of the premium paid.
Miller says that although unbundling could be done in theory, it could make
graphs more difficult to read and thus be counterproductive.
Also, Miller considered, but rejected, the outright banning of the sale of
certain combinations of products.
In particular, he has his eye on home income plans, in which mostly elderly
people are induced to take out a mortgage on their home and invest the
proceeds in mortgage endowment plans. 'Certainly there would be far fewer
cases of unsuitability if there were no endowment mortgages,' Miller said.
However, Miller says that this would be tantamount to making repayment
mortgages mandatory. But what would be wrong with that, many investors may
well ask? After all, repayment mortgages are the staple product of the US
mortgage market and that fact appears to have no adverse impact on home
sales in that company.
Finally, Miller suggests that when an investor comes face to face with a
sales agent, the agent should be required to describe himself specifically
as a sales agent, tell the investor who he works for and who pays him, and
outline exactly what he is allowed to sell.
It is difficult to believe that up until now, any other rules have been
allowed to prevail.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Watchdog to probe mortgage valuations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the more irritating costs incurred by homebuyers wanting a mortgage
is paying a valuation fee to the lender, even if they have commissioned
their own structural survey of the property.
This practice was referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on
Thursday by the Office of Fair Trading, after complaints that borrowers are
being overcharged. The inquiry will be directed at 'the agreements and
practices in the making or procuring of mortgage valuations, and the making
of charges for such valuations,' according to the OFT.
Most lenders offer borrowers a choice of valuation services - the most basic
is more for the lender's benefit than the borrower's. 'The Building
Societies Act requires that the lender takes adequate steps to ensure that a
property is good security on which to lend,' said a spokesman for Halifax
building society, the largest lender. 'That is why we require a valuation
report.'
The fee for this report is paid by the borrower and is usually a brief
statement of the price the valuer puts on the property. The borrower can opt
for more detailed reports, including a full structural survey.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, OFT director-general, said he was referring the matter
to the MMC because he was concerned that lenders have little incentive to
keep down the cost of the service, as it is passed on to the homebuyer.
He was also concerned that borrowers lacked choice in the amount they have
to pay because they had little opportunity to 'shop around' to cut the cost.
He said house buyers pay more than Pounds 100m a year for mortgage
valuations.
John Cox, group chief surveyor at Abbey National, the second largest lender,
said he was 'rather surprised' at the decision. 'I am confident that our
policy is fully justified and that it is in the best interests of the
homebuyer.'
Abbey National charges Pounds 175 for a valuation on a home purchase price
of Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 335 for a more detailed report on the property.
The Halifax charges Pounds 165 and Pounds 330.
The OFT also said there had been 'a great many complaints' from bodies
representing valuers and surveyors that some mortgage lenders are
restricting the ability of some surveyors to compete.
It said borrowers had been complaining about fee increases. There were also
complaints from valuers and surveyors that some lenders choose valuers on
the basis of the number of other borrowers they can refer to the lender. The
OFT was also concerned about complaints that many lenders seemed
increasingly unwilling to accept, for mortgage valuation purposes, house
surveys already carried out for a potential borrower.
John Cox said that there was no reason that a surveyor employed by a
borrower to carry out a structural survey would be qualified to make a
valuation. 'Structure is one thing. You need local knowledge to value a
property.'
The Council of Mortgage Lenders, which represents the big lenders, said that
it was confident that the OFT investigation would find that lenders'
practices are both 'prudent and reasonable.' It said that when a borrower
wants a structural survey, the lender is able to combine this with the
mortgage valuation at a cost lower than if the two services had been
supplied separately.
The MMC has until February 5 to complete its investigation.

BRITISH Telecommunications is expected to report on Thursday a drop in
pre-tax profits for the year ended March to about Pounds 2.5bn from Pounds
3bn a year earlier. The fall will be, however, after redundancy payments of
about Pounds 500m and exceptional costs of around Pounds 200m for
restructuring, redemption of bonds and other items.
Underlying profit growth last year was therefore around 2 to 3 per cent.
Inland call volumes rose, helping to offset lower tariffs. Further
redundancy costs are expected this year with the market looking for profits
in the Pounds 3.2bn-Pounds 3.5bn range.
J. Sainsbury, the food retailer, is forecast to report on Wednesday a hefty
increase in pre-tax profits for the year ended March to around Pounds 740m
from Pounds 628m a year earlier. Unlike its arch-rival Tesco it has managed
to maintain its growth momentum on sales volume while retaining a tight grip
on costs.
Grand Metropolitan is expected to report first half pre-tax profits of
Pounds 400m to Pounds 413m on Thursday, 2 to 3 per cent ahead of last year's
result, excluding exceptionals. Trading profits from the IDV spirits
business will be boosted by currency translation but the favourable exchange
rate is unlikely to compensate entirely for lower dollar profits from the US
food operations.
Royal Dutch Shell group will announce its first quarter results on Thursday
with analysts forecasting a wide range of income figures of between Pounds
600m and Pounds 800m on a replacement cost basis which strips out
stockholding losses and gains. The company reported a profit of Pounds 770m
in the same period last year, but this was buoyed by one-off exceptional
items.
Shell's first quarter results will signal how successful the company has
been at cutting costs and maintaining its profits against a background of
falling oil prices and deteriorating sales margins. Body Shop is forecast to
report on Wednesday a drop in pre-tax profits for the year to February of
about 20 per cent to around Pounds 20m. While international expansion
continues apace, UK prices and margins and slipped while volume growth has
faltered.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Test case decision gives guidance to
trustees - A ruling with wide ramifications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE GARNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEGAL system and ICI have shown just how adroit they can be in the face
of law which, if left unchanged, would produce results having little
relation to common sense. The problem arose from the demerger of ICI and a
subsidiary called Zeneca - a deal which gave trustees everywhere headaches
(as I reported on March 6).
ICI funded a test case which was started by originating summons on April 8.
A decision was given on Friday April 30, distinguishing the ICI de-merger
from previous cases. As a result, the Zeneca shares are now to be treated as
capital, not income. This has particular relevance for trustees who are
obliged under the terms of their trust to pay out all income to income
beneficiaries.
This decision is sensible, both for trust and tax reasons. It has been based
on what the judge called a 'highly formalistic' distinction between previous
cases involving distribution of profits by way of a dividend in specie, and
the proposed ICI/Zeneca demerger, which is to be regarded as a 'hybrid'
involving a dividend in specie and a capitalisation.
The details of this hybrid demerger are these. ICI is planning to separate
its bio-science activities from its traditional chemical operations. At the
moment, all the bio-science activities are concentrated in a subsidiary of
ICI called Zeneca Ltd.
Assuming the demerger is approved by shareholders, ICI will declare a
substantial dividend, which will be satisfied by the transfer of the shares
in Zeneca Ltd to a new company called Zeneca Group Plc. The latter will then
issue shares in itself to all the ICI shareholders. The value of the ICI
shares will drop by about half, but will be compensated-for by the issue of
shares in Zeneca equal to the difference.
In the case of trustees, where one set of beneficiaries is entitled to the
income of the trust and another is ultimately entitled to the capital, the
fall in value of ICI shares (which are part of the capital of the trust
fund) would not be compensated-for by the issue of shares in Zeneca if the
shares in the latter had to be treated as income and paid out to the income
beneficiary.
The only way trustees could protect themselves in such a case from a
potential claim for breach of trust would be for them to sell their ICI
shares before demerger. The sale proceeds could be retained as capital,
although it might trigger an unwanted tax charge.
Not only would the requirement to pass Zeneca shares to the income
beneficiary seem ludicrous from a common sense point of view, it would also
result in some very peculiar tax consequences as outlined in my earlier
article.
For these reasons, the judge has bent over backwards, despite a long line of
decided cases, to decide that the issue of the Zeneca Group Plc shares to
the ICI shareholders will be treated as capital and, therefore, must be
added to the trust fund and not paid out as income to the income
beneficiary.
The case before the courts concerned Dora Lee, who died in 1966. She left
her shareholding in a family company to her husband, William, for his
lifetime and thereafter to her son, Michael. In 1972, the shareholding was
acquired by ICI in exchange for ICI shares. The trustees never sold or
diversified away from their ICI holding, and the trust fund stake in ICI was
worth about Pounds 500,000 in April 1993. So, it was of great importance to
the trustees of Mrs Lee's will trust to know if they should distribute the
Zeneca shares (expected to be worth around Pounds 250,000) to William Lee;
keep them as part of the trust fund for Michael; or sell them.
It was obviously not Mrs Lee's intention to give her husband half the value
of her share portfolio. She wanted her husband to have only the income - eg,
normal dividends - from the trust for his life, and the share portfolio
preserved intact for her son.
There have been many cases, dating back to the 19th century, which have
decided that all distributions, including dividends in specie, are income
unless the distribution is part of an authorised reduction in capital or the
company is in liquidation.
But the judge distinguished this case from these earlier ones on the basis
that this was a more complicated demerger involving a third party, Zeneca,
and not a straightforward de-merger with a dividend in specie.
He appreciated that the corporate distinction was absurd and 'not an
attractive basis on which to place any reliance. It is highly formalistic .
. . but to regard the ICI transaction as a distribution of profits akin to
payment of a dividend in specie - and, hence, income - would be to exalt
company form over commercial substance to an unacceptable extent.'
This is good news for the trustee shareholders of ICI shares, but whether it
can be applied to other 'hybrid' de-mergers is debatable. It certainly does
not help straightforward demergers by dividend in specie. We are, therefore,
left with a technical distinction between two types of demerger - at least
until such time as a judge in a higher court is able to overturn some of the
more out-moded judgments.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Watchdog hits at quality of loan
advice - A new Consumers' Association survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENDOWMENT mortgages continue to be oversold because of the commission they
generate, according to the Consumers' Association's monthly magazine, Which?
It claims mortgage advice given by banks, building societies and brokers
often is misleading and inaccurate.
At their peak in 1988, mortgages linked to an endowment policy - a long-term
life insurance savings plan - accounted for 84 per cent of new mortgages
sold. That proportion has now fallen to 68 per cent.
Posing as home-buyers. the researchers for Which? visited 100 lenders across
the country. Mortgage advice was given by 72 advisers and the results are
based on those replies.
In 78 per cent of cases, it was found that endowments were the main
recommendation even though a repayment mortgage would have been just as
suitable.
Repayment mortgages do not pay commission, since there are no
insurance-related products involved. Instead, capital and interest are
repaid over the term of the loan.
But the researchers found that when repayment mortgages were discussed, the
tendency was to focus on their drawbacks compared with endowments. Lenders
where this tendency was particularly marked included Abbey National, Bank of
Ireland and Barclays bank.
Which? also says that 'advisers frequently twisted the facts to recommend
endowment mortgages.' Some staff said an endowment guaranteed to pay off the
mortgage - which is untrue. This claim came from Abbey National, Bank of
Scotland, Derbyshire BS, Leeds &amp; Holbeck BS, National Westminster bank and
TSB.
Although it is probable that most endowment policies will perform well
enough to pay off mortgages, Which? says advisers should have pointed out
there was a risk they might not - especially since life companies have been
cutting bonuses.
Even when asked which type of mortgage would be better if the potential
buyer was to sell his house and move abroad within a few years, endowments
were recommended as the best option in 87 per cent of cases. This is not the
best advice, since the buyer would have to continue paying premiums into the
endowment policy from abroad even after selling the property.
The few companies which suggested, correctly, that a repayment mortgage
would be better in such circumstances were Alliance &amp; Leicester, Bradford &amp;
Bingley (which recommended a mortgage linked to a personal equity plan for
its flexibility), Halifax, National &amp; Provincial, Northern Rock, Royal Bank
of Scotland, and Slater Hogg Mortgages in Edinburgh.
'Endowments are a major source of profit, and it is clear that employees are
encouraged to sell them,' says Which? But one heartening finding was that
most staff resisted the temptation to 'churn' - advising customers to
cash-in their existing endowment policy and take out a new one.
They were asked by researchers, posing as husband and wife, what should be
done with her existing endowment policy since the couple wanted to buy a
more expensive house. Most staff recommended that she keep the original
endowment and take out an additional one for the extra amount borrowed. But
Barclays suggested she take out a new endowment to cover both her and her
husband, and either cash-in her existing policy or continue it as a savings
plan.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Shedding light on share deals -
Individual investors can look forward to better information services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL NOW, individual investors who want to find out what is happening in
the stock market during the trading day have had to choose between cheap but
limited information services and professional data that comes with a price
tag worthy of Threadneedle Street. But recent changes in the management of
Topic, the London Stock Exchange's electronic information service, will
improve the situation.
The exchange is handing over Topic to two commercial companies: Telekurs,
controlled by the big Swiss banks, and ICV, an entrepreneurial company based
in Woking, Surrey. Telekurs is likely to concentrate on a relatively small
number of big customers who want an all-singing, all-dancing service. It is
the ICV offering, Topic 3 - due to open in the autumn - that could have
appeal for active individual investors.
ICV already puts out a service called Market-Eye, which provides real-time
prices on all quoted UK equities. This comes as a package made up of
television set plus decoder and keypad. The share prices are transmitted by
the BBC in a spare part of the normal television signal.
The service costs a private investor Pounds 850 a year, plus Pounds 1,150 to
buy the decoder (which can also be rented for Pounds 350 a year). Traded
options prices from Liffe cost another Pounds 350 and a service called
Dataload, which allows subscribers to download share prices directly into
their personal computers, another Pounds 350.
The service offers 'level one' share prices - that is, the best bid and
offer. Unlike Topic, Market-Eye does not include the fuller 'level two'
prices which show marketmakers' individual prices and the sizes of bargain
for which those prices are firm. On Market-Eye, shares belonging to
companies which have made stock exchange announcements during the day are
marked. But subscribers wanting to find out what the announcements are must
call their broker or the company.
This would quickly become tedious given the number of routine announcements
made by large companies but David Taylor, ICV's managing director, says the
company is considering adding a basic news service to Market-Eye which would
give subscribers the gist of each announcement. They could then decide
whether to investigate further.
BT's Citi-Service, a rival to ICV, already offers a news service. For Pounds
25 a quarter and a connect charge of 39p a minute, it provides real-time bid
and offer prices for all shares quoted on the stock exchange automated
quotations system (Seaq). If you have a computer and a modem, all you need
to connect is Prestel communications software - Pounds 25 to Citi-Service
subscribers. An additional Pounds 15 a quarter allows you to construct your
own portfolio of up to 100 shares. Because of the design of the Prestel
system, however, you cannot easily download to a computer database or
spreadsheet.
More active (and affluent) investors might want to wait for Topic 3 which
will be delivered via satellite and will offer a much fuller service,
including 'level two' prices and the stock exchange news service of company
announcements. It will also carry the 'closed user groups' now provided on
Topic; these are private pages made available to their clients by
stockbrokers.
Taylor says subscriptions probably will cost around Pounds 5,000 a year,
including renting the terminal. But there will be no telecommunications
costs, an important consideration for subscribers who live some distance
from London. The expense of the present Topic service is increased greatly
by the cost of the leased telephone lines needed to receive it, which are
priced according to distance.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Meanwhile, for those who simply cannot
wait . . .
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR INVESTORS with more modest information needs, a wide variety of services
is available already - some of them free. They include:
Teletext
This is the service that comes free with the television signal if you have a
set with teletext facilities; typically, these cost about Pounds 100 more
than basic sets.
The BBC service, Ceefax, provides prices of 500 shares, updated six times a
day. While this is adequate for keeping a casual eye on the market, it is
not really frequent enough to use for dealing decisions - especially as the
updates are delayed, so the prices are never really current. (The
restrictions are imposed by the stock exchange, which regards its real-time
prices as one of its most valuable assets and does not want to make them
available without payment).
Ceefax also provides financial news headlines, real-time foreign exchange
prices from NatWest, and real-time traded option prices from Liffe. It
carries some personal finance information, such as credit card interest
rates.
Share prices can be found on Ceefax page 220 on BBC1; the index is on page
200. A slower but more comprehensive service is available on BBC2.
The ITV and Channel 4 teletext service, known formerly as Oracle and now as
Teletext UK, offers more than 350 (delayed) share prices, plus company news
and market indicators. The index can be found on page 500 on Channel 4.
Telephone services
There is a wide variety of automated voice information telephone lines which
offer a surprisingly sophisticated range of services, the FT's Cityline
being one. Cityline provides automated real-time prices which you can dial
from any sort of phone, no matter how old-fashioned.
Each Monday's edition of the paper provides a Cityline code for shares in
the FT's London Share Service; you dial the Cityline 'phone number with that
code tacked on the end and get straight through to the share price of your
choice, delivered in a slightly choppy but perfectly clear robot voice.
Other newspapers offer a similar service. No subscription is required: you
pay by the call.
Cityline also offers some extras for people who have multi-frequency
telephones (most of those bought in the past few years can become
multi-frequency ones by turning a switch from 'pulse' to 'tone,' although
this works for normal calls only if you are connected to a digital
exchange).
These additional services include access to FT unit trust prices and net
asset values, which are updated once a day between 8 pm and 9 pm; and the
ability to construct a portfolio of your own shares so that, when you call
up using a personal access code, you can get an instant valuation of the
total portfolio and step through the individual prices one by one.
Cityline charges, which show up in your telephone bill, are 36p during
off-peak hours and 48p a minute at other times. There is no extra charge for
the portfolio service.
Further information: FT Cityline, tel. 071-873 4378.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Markets: Investing for income: consider the risks - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCIAL services industry is becoming ever more ingenious at offering
investors what they most seem to want - income.
Many investors have become used, in the high interest era of the early
1990s, income in to double digit percentages . This represents both a
problem and an opportunity for the industry. The problem is that, with base
rates at 6 per cent and equities yielding 4 per cent, achieving a 10 per
cent income is tough. But the opportunity is that, if a company can devise a
way of paying 10 per cent, the world might beat a path to its door.
Common sense tells us that, by aiming for a higher income, you accept a
higher risk. Normally, income comes at the expense of capital and indeed in
some products, capital loss is automatically built into the structure.
It is possible, occasionally, to get round this difficulty by exploiting an
anomaly in the market. The forthcoming investment trust from Ivory &amp; Sime
does so by making use of the Pounds 5,800 annual capital gains allowance to
give investors tax-free income. (The trust does have its risks, however, of
which more when it is launched.)
Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial has already achieved success in raising money with a
unit trust that uses futures and options to achieve a 10 per cent return. It
will be interesting to see whether this trust can achieve that level of
income without losing capital.
Save &amp; Prosper is the latest to test ingenuity on the market with a 'high
income bond' which bears many similarities to a product launched by Acuma
last month.
The bond offers a choice of income levels - 8 per cent or 10 per cent, net
of basic rate tax. These income levels are guaranteed. However, the capital
value of the bond is dependent on the UK stock market. At worst, if the
stock market falls, or fails to rise, over the next five years, the investor
will receive 60 per cent of capital back (at the 8 per cent income level) or
50 per cent (at the 10 per cent level).
In effect, this will mean that the investor will have received income and
capital payments equal to his or her original investment. This is the same
'money back' offer which is made on most guaranteed equity bonds - just
packaged in a different way. Of course, if all you did receive was your
money back you would have lost out - both from the effects of inflation and
from having missed the opportunity to invest elsewhere.
What investors really want, of course, is to get back all their original
capital on top of the income. To achieve this, the stock market, in the form
of the FT-SE 100 index, would have to grow by 25 per cent over five years
(on the 8 per cent option) or 60 per cent (on the 10 per cent option).
How likely is this? Save &amp; Prosper analysed all the five-year periods from
the start of January 1984 to April 1993 period (ie Jan 1 1984 to Jan 1 1989,
Feb 1 1984 to Feb 1 1989 and so on). It found the 25 per cent growth was
achieved on 88 per cent of occasions.
The higher growth rate of 60 per cent - needed to repay the capital of those
who opt for the 10 per cent income level - was achieved on only 54 per cent
of occasions. However, S &amp; P offers a 'lock-in' facility if the 60 per cent
growth rate is achieved at any time over the five years. Over the 1984-1993
period, this increased the chance of reaching the hurdle rate to 67 per
cent.
What happens if the stock market grows by more than zero, but less than the
hurdle rate of 25, or 60, per cent? The investor would receive less than the
original capital back, depending on the amount of growth. At the 8 per cent
income level, if the FT-SE 100 index rose 12.5 per cent, the investor would
get 80 per cent of the original capital repaid.
If the market grows by more than the hurdle rates over the five years,
investors are not entitled to any of the excess. Nor do they benefit from
FT-SE 100 Index yield; like most other guaranteed products, they return the
capital growth of the index only.
An example may help. If you invest Pounds 10,000 and take the 10 per cent
option, you will get Pounds 1,000 a year for five years. If the market falls
over the period, you will be repaid Pounds 5,000. If it rises by 30 per
cent, you will be repaid Pounds 7,500. If it rises by 60 per cent at any
time, you will get Pounds 10,000.
Income can be paid quarterly or annually. The minimum investment is Pounds
2,500 (Pounds 5,000 for those who want quarterly income) and there are no
additional fees. Higher rate taxpayers may face an additional tax charge,
reducing the returns to 6.9 per cent or 8.62 per cent respectively. The
offer runs from May 17 to June 25.
Is it a good deal? Only if the stock market does rise enough to pay back
your original investment. Otherwise, you are merely turning your capital
into income - and you can do that for yourself via the building society.
The chances of getting your money back are rather better than they were for
some of the other products of this type - the Scottish Widows annuity/Pep
launched last year required a 13 per cent growth rate per annum to repay
capital. On S &amp; P's 8 per cent income option, the FT-SE 100 has to rise at a
more modest 4.56 per cent per year. Put another way, FT-SE would have to
reach 3500 by 1998, a not unreasonable target.
So retired basic rate taxpayers who want income might consider the product.
But as with all the other attempts to market high income products, investors
should buy only if they understand the risks.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Markets: Local boy makes good: official - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT has received the following transcript, which appears to be a speech
by a local dignitary in a small town in northern Cyprus.
FELLOW Citizens, we gather today to welcome back to his homeland our
country's most distinguished businessman, Mr Asil Nadir.
His return fills our hearts with joy. Yet again we have triumphed over the
bungling and incompetence of our former colonial oppressors. It is
splendidly ironic that Asil Nadir's persecutors should carry the name of the
Serious Fraud Office, when the world knows they are about as serious as the
Keystone Kops.
It would be wrong to let this occasion pass, however, without devoting a few
moments' thought to the deeper issues that underlie Asil's presence here
among us.
I refer, of course, to the lamentable performance of the London stock
market. Not only has the Pounds 2bn at which Polly Peck was valued in 1990
disappeared into thin air - something which can only be attributed to the
machinations of those faceless conspirators known as 'the institutions' -
but there have also been more recent unhappinesses.
Since the beginning of the year, shares in Spring Ram have dropped by 35 per
cent, those of Fisons by 31 per cent, and those of Tiphook by 30 per cent,
to mention only three of the worst performers among that rogues gallery
known as the FT-SE Actuaries 350. All three of these have undergone
misfortunes of various sorts - accounting upsets at Spring Ram, continued
product problems at Fisons, and accusations that there might have been
insider trading in the run-up to a profits warning by Tiphook.
To us, perhaps, those are little-known companies in a far-off land. Others,
however, with reputations that extend as far as Larnaca, have also suffered:
Glaxo is down 25 per cent, Boots down 22 per cent and Sainsbury down 20 per
cent.
This has happened at a time when the random ragbag of numbers which pass for
British official statistics has indicated an end to the recession of which
Asil Nadir was so prominent a victim.
It is scarcely surprising, perhaps, that our brother Asil chose to turn his
back on Britain in the week when the FT-SE 100 index has dropped another
26.8 points, falling on three successive days, to close the week at 2793.7,
only 3 per cent higher than a year ago.
Nor is that all. Sterling, which managed a pitiable recovery from its lows
of late February, has failed to make a decisive crossing of the DM2 50
level. As you know, London is a primitive place, where the necromancers they
call currency analysts are given a credence way beyond their predictive
powers. We know better than to trust such foolishness. But for what it is
worth, some of these soothsayers now believe that sterling's forward
momentum has faded, and that the prospects of further appreciation are
limited, in the short term at least.
Similarly, long-term interest rates have continued to rise. The yield on the
10-year government bonds known by the sadly tarnished name of 'gilts' is
still 8.08 per cent, showing only the most minuscule improvement over the
previous week. The outlook for short term interest rates is also uncertain,
with many people fearing that a summer pickup in inflation may force a rise,
even though such rates are falling elsewhere in Europe. Perhaps the dire
performance of the Major puppet regime in Thursday's so-called council
elections will lead the government instead into a panic rush to cut rates in
the next few weeks; we shall see.
Note the way in which London share prices have broken away from the pattern
established in Wall Street, that far more important market across the sea.
Since late April, US share prices have moved upwards; those in the UK have
resolutely refused to take such a path, continuing the scarcely broken
downtrend established in early March.
In short, our brother Asil has little to regret in his heroic decision to
leave a place that has caused him so much pain. Still, many of our
fellow-countrymen remain trapped there, often by mortgages worth more than
the north London houses on which they are secured.
Alas, that imprisonment may linger. This week, I fear, has seen some signs
that UK inflation may not rise as much as our imprisoned mortgage-holders
might wish.
One such example: sun-cream, that vital commodity to all who visit our
beautiful beaches, has become the subject of a price war between Boots,
which supplies 47 per cent of UK demand, and Superdrug, which is prepared to
surrender some profit in order to gain market share. Similarly, Direct Line,
the Royal Bank of Scotland's low-cost insurance subsidiary, is taking its
own price-war into other sectors of financial services. As long as such
battles are at work, UK inflationary pressures are likely to remain lower
than desired by those of our compatriots with mortgages to repay.
We salute our comrades, hostages to the British disinflationary process. And
we express solidarity with all other such hostages, including those
shareholders trapped by the forced levy known as the 'rights issue'. Yet
again this week, innocent law-abiding citizens, wishing nothing more than to
enjoy their dividends in peace, have been forced to send cash the other way,
contributing Pounds 404m at the metaphorical equivalent of gunpoint to Royal
Insurance's coffers. A further such ransom demand is on its way from Zeneca,
the ICI subsidiary. Is this fair, fellow citizens?
It is not. Surely, Asil Nadir deserves our praise and admiration for so
decisively rejecting the tired mores of a discredited mercantile clique. We
cheer his return among us, to enjoy in peace the fruits of his labours in
foreign fields. Brother Asil, welcome home]

FT  08 MAY 93 / Markets: Smoke signals from price war - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US cigarette price wars and concern about President Bill Clinton's plans
for a 'sin tax' on smoking have put the shares of BAT Industries, the
UK-based tobacco and financial services group, under a cloud.
BAT's shares reached 999p by the beginning of April, after the group had
reported a 68 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for 1992 and then
intrigued the City by offering an enhanced scrip dividend, partly to help
deal with the group's problem of unrelieved Advance Corporation Tax.
The share price rise came to a sudden halt on April 2, when the US tobacco
group Philip Morris announced that it would slash the price of Marlboro
cigarettes to protect its market share from the rise of discount brands.
Concern about the impact of this move on the UK group caused an immediate
slump in BAT's shares, which are now 14 per cent below their peak.
Reporting the group's first-quarter results this week, Sir Patrick Sheehy,
BAT's chairman, conceded: 'The price war is clearly set for a period of
significant aggravation but it remains to be seen how intensive and how
persistent our competitors' activity will be.'
But he urged shareholders to keep a sense of perspective, pointing out that
the proportion of group trading profits coming from the US domestic tobacco
market was falling and was only 20 per cent last year, down from 30 per cent
in 1991.
BAT's shares shed 24p on Wednesday, even although the group's announced a 40
per cent increase in pre-tax profits in the three months to March 31. What
concerned the City this week was the news that tobacco profits had already
slipped 3 per cent in the first quarter - the period just before Philip
Morris slashed prices. The group blamed a number of factors, such as lower
volumes at Brown &amp; Williamson, its US cigarette subsidiary, and a sharp
downturn in Germany.
BAT has now acknowledged that President Clinton's federal tax on tobacco
could be as high as Dollars 1 per pack - a huge hike from the present level
of 24 cents per pack, especially when one considers BAT's brands currently
sell for an average of Dollars 1.50. However, the group points out that the
Dollars 1 level might just be an opening bid in the coming tussle with
Congress. Clinton's health care proposals might now be delayed until
mid-June, which would suggest any new tax could not be imposed before
January, 1995 - a year later than first thought.
All this concern over tobacco is understandable, but the share price
reaction may be overdone. Having suffered huge losses on mortgage indemnity
policies though its Eagle Star subsidiary, BAT is now able to rely on the
strength of its financial services side to see it through a tricky patch for
tobacco.
Financial services increased trading profits by 48 per cent in the first
quarter. In the general business Farmers, the US insurance subsidiary,
continued to progress and the ongoing recovery at Eagle Star contributed to
a profit of Pounds 93m (up from Pounds 43m). In the life business, Allied
Dunbar, Eagle Star and Farmers all recorded good premium growth.
BAT shares are currently on a prospective multiple of 11.6, a 19 per cent
discount to the market. NatWest Securities points out that even in the
unlikely event of all US domestic tobacco profits being wiped out this year,
the group could still increase its dividend by 8 per cent and cover it 1.6
times. A prospective yield of 5.8 per cent puts them on a yield premium of
more than 30 per cent.
Some investors may consider the time has come to get out of tobacco, given
the US uncertainties. However, BAT is expanding strongly overseas and sees
huge growth potential in markets such as eastern Europe and Asia.
One reason the group pioneered the enhanced scrip dividend was its
confidence that it could better invest the cash in tobacco businesses, which
enjoy a return on assets of more than 20 per cent.
There is certainly a macabre complementarity to selling both cigarettes and
insurance policies. For investors who do not find the tobacco trade
distasteful, the shares look undervalued on fundamentals.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Markets: Stocks languish under the weather - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUMMER put in an early appearance in New York this week, with a string of
hot, humid days.
While the tourists in Central Park enjoyed the August-like conditions, the
weather-induced torpor took its toll on Wall Street, where trading on the
stock markets was as suffocating as the climate outside.
After a bright start on Monday, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained
18 points on a burst of late buying, the broader market quickly lost
momentum. Over the next three and a half trading days, the Dow barely budged
as investors struggled to find persuasive cause to buy, or sell, stocks.
Many had hoped yesterday's April employment report would provide the
motivation to return to the markets. Unfortunately, the employment data
disappointed.
The Labor department reported that the civilian unemployment rate remained
unchanged at 7 per cent, and that non-farm payrolls rose 119,000 last month,
slightly less than analysts had expected. Somewhat worryingly, the
manufacturing sector lost 65,000 jobs during April, while the construction
sector also reported a fall in the number of workers with jobs.
This surprised analysts, although labour market statisticians once again
blamed part of the declines on bad weather, claiming that heavy rains had
depressed demand for construction work, and that poor weather nationwide had
affected employment in food processing.
Even the winter storms of March were dredged up again to explain some of the
disappointing figures. Apparently, inventories had grown sharply in March
because the winter storms had depressed demand, so in April companies chose
to run down those inventories rather than hire fresh labour to manufacture
new goods.
Blaming the weather failed to impress investors, who were distinctly
underwhelmed by the employment report. By late yesterday morning, three
hours after the release of the data, the Dow was down two points, the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was almost unchanged and the Nasdaq composite, which
has proved the liveliest equity index this week, were slightly higher.
A good clue to market sentiment was the performance of shares quoted on the
American Stock Exchange. The Amex is home to many small-to-medium sized
companies, and is usually overlooked because trading is so much heavier on
the much bigger New York Stock Exchange.
This week, however, the Amex's market value index hit record highs on three
consecutive days while the Dow and S &amp; P 500 have languished. Analysts
believe the strength of Amex stocks has been a reflection of investors'
unease with the broader market, whose poor performance has forced investors
to turn to smaller company stocks in the hope that they will produce
returns.
The strong run from Amex stocks aside, investors remain confused about the
outlook for equities and corporate earnings, and their recent behaviour has
been particularly skittish.
Cable television stocks were a good example this week. On Tuesday, buyers
rushed to the sector after analysts judged that the new industry
regulations, unveiled by the Federal Communications Commission late on
Monday, looked as if they were going to be less onerous for cable TV
companies than had been feared originally.
A string of big cable TV stocks rose handily on this news, including Time
Warner, Cablevision, Comcast and Tele-Communications Inc. (Time Warner was
given an additional lift by rumours in the market that Warren Buffett, the
billionaire reknowned for his canny investments, had bought a 5 per cent
stake in the company. As of yesterday, the rumour had not yet been
confirmed.)
The rally in the cable TV sector, however, proved extremely short-lived. On
Wednesday, the buying gave way to heavy selling, and all the stocks that had
recorded big advances on Tuesday gave most of their gains back as some
leading industry analysts backed away from their initial judgment, warning
that it was too early to tell what how the new regulations would effect
cable TV companies.
There was a similar display of investors' nerves in airline stocks this
week. On Monday the big three - Delta, AMR (parent of American Airlines) and
UAL - rose sharply, on hopes that the airline industry may have got over the
worst of its slump.
By yesterday, however, AMR, UAL and Delta share were back in the doghouse as
investors suddenly got nervous about what the latest outbreak in the air
fare wars might do the industry's bottom line.

<TEXT>
John Govett has launched an assured tenancy Business Expansion Scheme,
Govett Assetbuilder IV. The scheme aims to raise Pounds 12.75m to develop a
mill and surrounding properties in Ashton-under-Lyne.
There is an option to sell the properties to the Sanctuary Housing
Association at 117p in five years time; this equates to a 13.38 per cent per
annum return for top rate taxpayers and a 9.08 per cent return for basic
rate taxpayers. Sanctuary is putting up cash collateral worth 60 per cent of
the buy-back price.

Money flowed into investment trust savings schemes in the first quarter of
1993, with Pounds 48.14m invested, the highest total for a single quarter.
The inflow came after investment into such schemes dipped slightly last
year. Lump sum investments were mainly responsible, totalling Pounds 35.13m
compared with Pounds 21.72m in the fourth quarter of 1992.
The number of regular savings accounts also increased, from 55,972 to

FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: House prices rose 1.6 per cent in
April - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
House prices in the UK rose by a seasonally-adjusted 1.6 per cent in April,
the largest monthly increase for more than four years, according to Halifax
building society this week.
This follows a 1.4 per cent rise reported by the society in March. The
average price of a home at the end of April was Pounds 63,144, which was
still 2.3 per cent lower than during April last year. Halifax said the
figures 'could be a sign that house prices may well start to increase
earlier than most analysts have anticipated'.
But Nationwide, the second largest building society, found only a modest
rise in prices of 0.1 per cent in April, following a 1 per cent increase in
March.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Spot the anorak on Platform 5: Richard Tomkins mingles with
the number-crunchers and track bashers at Crewe railway junction to seek the
answer to life's great mystery: just why do train spotters do it?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREWE, Cheshire: the railway junction epitomised. It is 9am on a grey
Saturday and people are gathering in knots at the ends of the bleak station
platforms, shifting listlessly from foot to foot.
Like others, they are waiting for trains. But two things tell you these are
no ordinary passengers. As they peer down the line at an approaching speck
on the horizon, they exclaim: 'It's a siphon]' 'It's a double-header]' or
'It's an 87]'. And when the speck becomes a train, pulls into the station,
and pulls out again, it goes without them: they remain on the platform,
waiting for the next speck to appear.
These people are train spotters. No one is quite sure exactly why they do
what they do, but Crewe is where they like to do it. As one of the busiest
main line junctions in Britain, it draws rail enthusiasts from across the
country. Young and old, rich and poor, they are united by their anoraks,
their multi-coloured Biros, and a near-total inability to find a convincing
explanation for their behaviour.
History does not relate how trainspotting started, but the Victorian
engineer George Stephenson must bear part of the blame. When he put the
first engine into service on the Stockton &amp; Darlington Railway in 1825, he
not only gave it a name - Locomotion - but also labelled it No. 1. Once
numbers had become established as the accepted method of marking railway
engines, it was arguably only a matter of time before someone yielded to the
compulsion to start writing them down.
Even so, the hobby might hardly have progressed had it not been for a man
named Ian Allan. While working as a junior clerk for the pre-nationalisation
Southern Railway during the second world war, Allan found himself beset with
requests for details of the company's engines. So in 1942, he won permission
from the Southern to publish a list of them under the title abc of Southern
Locomotives. The book was a runaway success. A trainspotting publishing
empire was born.
In the immediate post-war era trainspotting remained an unsophisticated
hobby, consisting mainly of ticking off numbers in the Ian Allan books as
locomotives were seen. The pastime looked in danger of dying out in the
1960s when steam engines started giving way to a much smaller fleet of
humdrum diesel and electric locomotives. But today's adherents are tackling
the hobby with a degree of dedication that puts earlier exponents in the
shade.
Railway book publishing, for example, has expanded to cater for every
proclivity: titles on offer include Locomotive Boiler Explosions by CH
Hewison, Great Western Engine Sheds 1837-1947 by E. Lyons &amp; E. Mountford,
and Searching for Railway Telegraph Insulators by WK Neal.
Modern technology, too, has added a new dimension to the hobby. Nowadays,
the notebook and Biro is not enough: serious spotters carry micro-cassette
recorders or camcorders to record locomotive sightings. Back home, they
enact the role of the engine driver by watching pre-recorded videos of train
journeys shot from the driver's cab, or plan the next day's spotting by
dialling an 0898 telephone number for details of interesting traffic
movements.
For those with home computers, one railway magazine advertiser offers a disk
that contains all UK locomotive numbers and allows users to add their
spotting notes and comments. Another offers a programme simulating the
operation of Leicester signalbox. ('Full colour on-screen track diagram . .
. you control all traffic movements . . . wide variety of passenger and
freight workings.') A third offers a souped-up signalbox simulation
incorporating random train delays. ('Even more realistic,' the advertisement
justifiably claims.)
Meanwhile, the vocabulary of trainspotting has changed with the times. Steam
enthusiasts always had affectionate nicknames for different locomotive
types: 'crabs', 'semis', 'spam cans' and so on. Now a new set of names,
similarly obscure in origin, has sprung up for today's diesels and
electrics: 'duffs', 'spoons', 'hoovers', 'siphons', 'goyles' and 'rats'.
Spotters themselves have long been known as 'gricers' - according to one
theory, after a champion spotter named Richard Grice. But beneath this
general heading, sub-heads have appeared. 'Number crunchers' collect
anything with a number on it, including carriages and wagons; 'bashers'
specialise in riding trains hauled by different locomotives; and 'track
bashers' collect trips on different sections of line.
At Crewe, you tend to get a relatively normal sort of spotter: the bashers,
after all, are out there riding the trains. So this seems as good a place as
any to seek an answer to that most enduring of life's mysteries: just what
makes train spotters do it?
Out at the south end of platform 6 stands a middle-aged man in blue anorak,
blue jeans, flat cap and - oddly, given the overcast sky - dark glasses. He
declines to give his name ('I'm anonymous; that's the way I am') but admits
to being a bookkeeper for a tank storage depot in Birkenhead.
'I have never lost the ability to stand at the end of a platform for six or
seven hours at a time,' he says. 'My philosophy is that it's important to
have a hobby in life. I feel sorry for people who jeer at us and have
nothing of their own.'
Well, a hobby, yes. But why trainspotting?
'There is infinite variety in the railway scene. Engines are chameleon-like.
People complain that some of them are 30 years old, but they're always being
renumbered, repainted or rebuilt . . . ' He is distracted by a movement of
rolling stock further up the tracks.
'Yes, there is always the unexpected in this hobby . . . seeing something in
an unusual location . . . you never know what's going to happen.' Then,
suddenly: 'There] Look at that] A Network SouthEast loco coming out of the
siding]' He whips out a pair of binoculars, clasps them to his eyes, and
feverishly writes down the number. 'There you've got it, you see - a whole
panoply of change.'
Nearby, 13-year-old Liam White from Warrington - grey anorak, blue jeans,
red hair and freckles - has identified an approaching speck as a class 87
electric loco hauling a northbound express. He knows it is a class 87
because he can make out two windows on the front of the cab. Three windows,
and it would be a class 86.
'I've been doing it for five months,' he says. 'Me and a friend, we're
seeing who can get the most numbers. I've got two more than him - nearly
1,000. We usually go to Warrington Bank Quay, but I've come down here to get
some more.'
But what is to stop his friend just crossing off a few numbers while Liam's
back is turned?
'That'd be cheating, if he crossed one off.'
So?
'Well, if he crossed off 58020 I could say to him: 'You can't have seen that
because it wouldn't have gone through Bank Quay'.'
But couldn't he claim it was passing through the station on an, er, unusual
working?
'No. It's too big.'
Down the other end of the platform, 30-year-old Ray Cavanagh - blue anorak,
blue jeans, a storekeeper from Birkenhead - has a camera round his neck.
'Some people take numbers, I take pictures,' he says. His attention is
caught by an approaching rumble. 'I'll just take a picture of this. I'll be
back.'
The rumble is a trainload of several hundred enthusiasts being hauled by a
class 37 diesel locomotive from Bristol to Holyhead and back. The weather is
chilly but because the engine is a goods locomotive, it is not fitted with
train heating equipment. It would not make any difference if it was, because
all the windows are open so that the passengers can lean out and listen to
the engine.
Ray takes a photograph, then returns to explain the lure of spotting. 'It's
good fun travelling around and seeing places you haven't seen before. You
meet interesting people, and you can tell them what you've seen, and they
can tell you what they've seen.' Then, perhaps aware that all this may sound
a bit lame: 'Personally, I could never understand the attraction of sitting
on a riverbank for hours on end waiting for something to grab your hook.'
This is a common response among train spotters. Unable to rationalise their
obsession, they tend to fall back on the excuse that is no worse than doing
something else. Hence, when a spotter on platform 5, a civil engineer named
Keith Slaney, is asked what his wife thinks of his continual absences on
spotting excursions, he says: 'I think she'd rather it was trains than
another woman.'
Keith is one of a dozen or so representatives of the West Yorkshire branch
of the Rail Correspondence &amp; Travel Society, apparently a club for people
who cannot help wearing anoraks. Interestingly, today's outing includes two
women, both with their husbands. 'It's like everything else: you either let
them go their own way and get on with it, or go with them and enjoy it,'
says one, Sue Coville.
The day seems to have settled into a lunch-time lull, and one club member
has staggered back from the chip shop with chips for everyone. Sue and
husband Gordon, a buyer for a textile company, embark on the story of how
they once set out in their car for an all-night trainspotting session beside
the tracks at Shap, a summit in Cumbria. On arrival, they found that the
engine numbers were invisible in the dark. They hit on the idea of pointing
their car at the tracks and, when a train approached, bathing it in light
with their headlamps. This worked well until an engine driver who had
undergone illumination reported the incident to the police. Later that
night, Sue and Gordon were interrupted by a rap on the car roof from a
constable. 'But luckily, he turned out to be an enthusiast too, so he
understood.'
Further down platform 5, 28-year-old Richard Smith from Leicestershire
appears to be wearing a green anorak, but on closer inspection it turns out
to be a waxed cotton jacket. Is this a spotter with a difference? 'I'm a
closet spotter, really,' he says. 'People think all spotters are prats, and
quite a lot of them are: there are some right plonkers around. I work in a
bank, but I don't tell people there I do it.'
Richard says he caught the spotting habit from his father. He has already
seen all 17,115 of British Rail's locomotives and passenger vehicles and is
now on his second time round. 'If you've got an interest in railway trains
and you are going out to see them, you might as well write their numbers
down.'
Is he absolutely sure?
'Well, to tell you the truth, it is a bit boring. But if I wasn't doing this
I'd only be stuck at home or doing the shopping or something.'
It's the same old story: it is better than doing something else. Clearly, no
amount of time at Crewe will explain what makes spotters spot. And so we
turn to the father of modern trainspotting himself - Ian Allan, still
running his publishing business in Shepperton, Middlesex, at the age of 70.
According to Allan, the reason for the peculiarly British obsession with
trainspotting is sheer opportunism. In an island as densely populated as
Britain and with such an extensive railway network, no one is very far from
a busy railway line.
'If you go to Clapham Junction (in London) you can see 2,500 trains a day.
It's non-stop entertainment - there is always something going on. But if you
go to a French station and watch a train go past, you might wait six hours
until you see another one. There are nothing like sufficient trains to keep
people's interest going.'
It is plausible, up to a point. But if that were the only explanation, then
everyone in Britain would be a spotter. Surely there must be a more
deep-rooted motivation? Something, perhaps, in the psyche?
'No idea, unless it's a collecting urge,' says Allan. And indeed it is - or
at least partly so, says Dr David Weeks, a clinical psychologist
specialising in the study of eccentric behaviour.
According to Dr Weeks, train spotters fall broadly into two main personality
types. One, the schizoid type, comprises the sort of person who feels ill at
ease socially and prefers the company of inanimate objects. (Examples
include people who develop an unusual degree of interest in activities such
as computing or weight training.) The other, the obsessional type, comprises
those who want everything to be perfect, tidy, neat and clean - among them,
the collectors of stamps or china and spotters of aircraft or birds, for all
of whom an incomplete set of objects represents an imperfect set.
These personality traits, alone or in combination, are found in quite
sizeable chunks of the population, says Weeks. They may express themselves
in behavioural oddities such as fanatical enthusiasm for an obscure rock
group or a losing football team, or in sexual terms, through an obsession
with high heels or underwear. But there is no reason to be concerned about
the traits unless they are taken to extremes, Weeks emphasises. 'The vast
majority of train spotters are perfectly normal and reasonable people.'
This is, of course, nonsense: we all know that train spotters are unhinged.
And yet, just one day at Crewe has shown how short a time it can take to see
a considerable number of trains. Let's see now . . . a couple more visits
would probably enough to finish off the class 87s: after that, there would
only be another 2,432 locomotives, 14,648 carriages and 28,884 wagons to go
. . .

FT  08 MAY 93 / The Long View: End of the City gent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN IRA bomb may have blown out the windows, but it is a combination of
deregulation and competition that threatens to destroy the heart of the City
of London.
Two of its greatest institutions, the Stock Exchange and Lloyd's, are in
deep trouble. The coffee house origins of Lloyd's and the Stock Exchange go
back to 1688 and 1773 respectively - so a lot of history is at stake. That
both institutions are in distress at the same time cannot be coincidence,
and is telling us something important about the City and its place within
the international financial markets.
For centuries the City's financial industry has been protected by the
British government. This was a key aspect of British colonialism: the
finance and trade of the empire would be controlled through London, leading
to thriving markets in insurance, banking, securities and commodities.
Such matters are comprehensively treated in a two-volume history British
Imperialism* by P J Cain and A G Hopkins. The authors develop the concept of
'gentlemanly capitalism' to explain why the UK grew a top-heavy financial
system and exported financial services where other countries concentrated on
industrial or agricultural goods.
From the beginning, they argue, social status was conferred by involvement
with aristocratic and imperialist pursuits, leading to an exaggerated role
in the UK for the professions and the Civil Service, especially colonial
administration. Manufacturing industry, concentrated in the socially
subordinate north of the country, was tolerated for the wealth it created
but was regarded as a threat to the established social order and, with its
huge workforces, as a breeding-ground for socialism.
These issues have repeatedly surfaced throughout recent British history. In
1930, for instance, the Macmillan Committee observed that 'in some respects
the City is more highly organised to provide capital to foreign countries
than to British industry'. The second world war, however, caused a huge loss
of Britain's overseas wealth and led to a crippling framework of high tax
rates and foreign exchange controls which was not finally dismantled until
Thatcherism arrived in 1979.
At Lloyd's, ironically, this postwar framework eventually created an
enormous boom. Aided by favourable legislation, and a nod and a wink from
the tax man, it was able to exploit loopholes on an ever-increasing scale.
At home the wealthy Names saw an opportunity to avoid high taxes and
exchange controls, while regulatory anomalies in the insurance business
overseas (especially in the US) offered lucrative opportunities. By the
1970s, however, huge profits were corrupting the fragile gentlemanly ethics
in Lime Street. During the 1980s the rapacious US legal system pounced on a
soft target by raising fines and penalties (on asbestosis cases, for
example) to levels undreamt of by Lloyd's underwriters.
Lloyd's had expanded disastrously out of its original niche in the insurance
of ships and had blundered into too many areas it did not understand. It
thrived while protected by the old traditions of the British Empire, but
what now? Its bleak choices amount either to a retreat to whatever is left
of its marine and aviation niche, or an attempt to compete on equal terms
with insurers around the globe. Being gentlemanly will not be enough.
The similarities between Lloyd's and the Stock Exchange are far from
complete. Both have been protected by legislation, being allowed a
tremendous degree of self-regulation. Both were clubby and inward-looking,
with strong links to the upper class social network. Both kept out corporate
interests by insisting on unlimited liability.
Unlike Lloyd's, however, after the second world war the London Stock
Exchange could find few loopholes and it was forced to suppress its
international ambitions. It survived by refining its domestic monopoly, but
that made it unable to respond to the opportunity created by the Eurobond
market from the late 1960s onwards because Eurobond firms could not be
brought within the membership structure.
The Bank of England, by that time again actively promoting the City of
London's global reach, began to be displeased. In the late 1970s a Labour
government referred the Exchange to the Restrictive Practices Court. The
incoming Thatcher administration maintained the threat. The eventual outcome
was the Big Bang deregulation.
At last the Stock Exchange saw a window of opportunity. It would invite in
global securities firms and mount a challenge to the even sleepier and more
inward-looking bourses of continental Europe. Sure enough its new SEAQ
International market has proved an astonishing success, for instance
handling nearly 40 per cent of turnover in French shares in 1992. But will
this success endure? There is no red on the map to protect it.
No longer backed by thousands of individual members dependent on it for
monopoly profits, the London Stock Exchange now relies on the doubtful
loyalty of a small number of international securities houses. The debacle of
Taurus, the settlement system that proved beyond the Exchange's competence
to develop, provided a reminder of the dangerous link between gentlemen and
amateurism.
Cain and Hopkins suggest that the momentum of history is too powerful to be
easily reversed. My own view is that they may be underestimating the degree
of internationalisation of the whole economy, not just the City itself. What
remains of the manufacturing sector is increasingly dominated by powerful
overseas interests. Whereas British industrialists could be ignored, or
fobbed off with peerages, Nissan, IBM and Siemens will demand a
pro-manufacturing attitude. As the British political establishment again
displays its liking for an overvaluation of sterling, a battle looms.
*British Imperialism: 1688-1914 and 1914-1990 (two vols) by Cain and
Hopkins, published by Longman.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Guards held over City looting: Many tenants report thefts
from offices after IRA bomb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Financial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE SECURITY guards were arrested by the City of London police yesterday
in connection with theft from buildings damaged by the IRA bomb two weeks
ago.
The police said the latest arrests, together with five arrests made last
weekend, concerned six burglaries committed in the wake of the bomb blast in
Bishopsgate.
Nine 'relatively minor' thefts were reported by tenants after they regained
access to their buildings five days after the bomb.
Bottles of wine, paintings, fountain pens, Dictaphones and petty cash were
among items reported stolen.
'The things that were taken were small in value terms but disproportionately
upsetting,' said Mr Chris Manners of Norton Rose, a firm of solicitors,
which believes the thefts took place on the Monday after the bomb. 'They
were often things of sentimental value.'
'It's more upsetting than the bomb itself,' said one solicitor, whose office
was looted and vandalised. He said that when staff returned to the office on
the Tuesday after the bombing they found most desks, drawers and cabinets
had been forced open and drinks cabinets emptied.
Petty cash, cheques, squash rackets, gold pens, luggage and wine were taken
from the London office of Blake Cassells &amp; Graydon, a Toronto law firm,
which had an office on the 15th floor of 99 Bishopsgate.
'It's crystal clear that widespread pilfering has been going on and that
whoever was responsible had the time to go through the office and decide
just what they wanted,' said Mr David Glennie, managing partner.
'It's very, very disturbing. It's bad enough to have had your offices
sprayed with glass and have suffered other damage without someone coming
along and dancing on your grave.'
The Banco di Sicilia, which has offices at 99 Bishopsgate, said some
paintings were stolen during the bank holiday weekend. Mr Peter Franklin,
finance director of Rea Brothers, reported thefts from the merchant bank's
offices in Alderman's House, Alderman's Walk, before the building was fully
secured.
The thieves, whom he described as 'rank amateurs', had jemmied open desks,
forced briefcases and taken small items of little value from offices. 'They
even broke open a coffee machine to steal the money inside, not realising
that the coffee was free so there was no money,' he said.
Many of the companies affected said that the large numbers of workers
drafted in to clear up the bomb damage had created conditions for
opportunistic theft.
Mr David Stedman, managing partner at Penningtons, solicitors, said security
in the building had been a problem after the bombing, with different
security staff and contractors working for different tenants. 'It was very
difficult to know just who everybody was,' he said.
'It would have been easy for anyone to put on a hard hat and come into a
building,' said Mr Chris Manners of Norton Rose, solicitors.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Move to allow incentives for workers to quit trade unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to move quickly to strengthen employers' rights to
derecognise trade unions and introduce personal contracts.
This follows a Court of Appeal ruling that it is unlawful for workers to be
offered financial incentives to give up union membership.
A last-minute amendment to the employment bill going through the House of
Lords will make clear an employer's right to withhold a pay increase from
any worker who refuses to sign a personal contract.
A separate late amendment to the bill will deal with workers who refuse to
transfer to a new employer under the EC Transfer of Undertakings Regulations
(Protection of Employment) - known as the Tupe regulations. The current
uncertainties surrounding Tupe have been of particular concern to companies
bidding to take over work from the public sector.
Last Friday the Court of Appeal ruled that employers' use of financial
incentives to workers to leave a union amounted to unlawful discrimination
against those who wished to continue their membership.
The court upheld two appeals by members of the RMT transport union and the
National Union of Journalists whose employers, Associated British Ports and
Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail, had offered pay rises
to staff prepared to sign personal contracts but not to those who wanted to
remain union members.
The Department of Employment said yesterday that an amendment to the trade
union reform and employment rights bill would be brought forward at the
bill's third reading in the Lords, probably in the next few days. The
amendment would 'clarify the law to allow employers to derecognise unions if
they so want', said the department. The move provoked a sharp reaction from
unions yesterday. Mr John Foster, NUJ general secretary, said: 'This is
corruption. They are seeking to change the law with no consultation and no
green paper. It is treating judges with contempt. This amendment is a
blatant encouragement for firms to derecognise unions and further destroy
workplace rights in Britain.'
The separate amendment relating to Tupe will mean that any worker who
refuses to transfer to a new employer after an organisation is taken over -
or work in the public sector is contracted out - will be deemed to have left
their job voluntarily.
In the case of Katsikas v Konstantinidis in the European Court of Justice in
December, it was decided that an employee had a right not to be transferred,
but that it was up to member states whether employees had a right to
continue to be employed by the previous employer.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Allied consensus on Bosnia close, says Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton said yesterday that he thought the US and its allies
were close to reaching 'a common policy' on the next moves in the Bosnian
conflict.
'I think we have to turn up the heat and keep the pressure on,' Mr Clinton
said, adding that he had the 'feeling' that an allied consensus could be
reached 'fairly shortly'.
He dismissed differences with Europe as 'disagreement round the edges of
what tactical steps should be done'.
In Rome, Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said that 'some
military action' could be justified under existing United Nations
authorisation but a wider engagement would probably require additional
Security Council approval. He said he had found broad agreement in Europe on
the need for an 'assertive, effective programme' of action.
The new Italian government threw its weight behind firmer action against the
Bosnian Serbs but insisted any initiative had to be within the context of
the UN.
In Bosnia, the eastern Moslem enclave of Zepa, declared a 'safe zone' in a
Security Council resolution on Thursday, was yesterday again reported to be
under heavy fire from the Bosnian Serbs. Sarajevo radio said more than 200
people had been killed and 300 wounded since the assault began on Tuesday.
Despite promises by Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, that his
men would comply with the UN resolution, General Philippe Morillon, the UN
commander, was again unable to reach agreement with General Ratko Mladic,
the Bosnian Serb military chief, to send unarmed UN observers to Zepa.
Lord Owen, the EC negotiator, urged the US to send troops to join the UN
humanitarian operations. He argued that US negotiations with European allies
would have been 'much easier' if US forces had already been on the ground.
Air strikes could help tilt the military balance but only if conducted 'with
great skill and care'.
Any further announcement is likely to depend on weekend talks between Mr
Clinton and Mr Christopher.

FT  08 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: UK housing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's withdrawal from the ERM meant it was only a matter of time before a
housing recovery began. Sure enough, along it comes. This week the Halifax
building society reported a 1.6 per cent rise in house prices in April
bringing the total to 2.5 per cent this year. Mortgage lending by the
clearing banks rose 14 per cent in the first quarter. The media excites
itself over forecasts of a 10 per cent rise in Greater London house prices
next year. Soon the assets of the 1.9m house buyers with negative equity may
be worth what was paid for them.
It would, though, be wrong to over-egg the excitement. Recovery is likely to
prove muted and slow. Prices still have to rise a long way to recapture
historic highs. First-time buyers may be abundant but there is markedly less
activity higher up the chain with owners snared in the negative equity trap.
Stricter credit terms to meet revised mortgage indemnity rules and weak
building society margins will also limit credit expansion. There are still
some 150,000 unsold empty properties to dampen prices.
What the housing flurry means for the economy at large is a moot point.
Higher turnover may have sparked retail sales. But if the recession really
has convinced buyers that houses are abodes not investment vehicles cautious
individuals may continue to channel marginal income into savings not
consumption. The higher proportion of new borrowers holding fixed rate
mortgages may also have broader implications. The interest rate weapon will
be a less effective way for the government to curb consumer demand in
future.

FT  08 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Italy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors are warming to the view that recent political developments in
Italy mark a turning point for Europe's third biggest economy which should
stimulate development of more attractive capital markets. The likely
confirmation of a non-political central banker, such as Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi, as prime minister is bound to win applause from investors. This
week's appointment of the no-nonsense Antonio Fazio as governor of the Bank
of Italy also reinforces Italy's new-found commitment to economic reform,
control of inflation, privatisation, and a reduced budget deficit.
The Milan stock market has certainly responded enthusiastically. Its 21 per
cent rise this year has far outpaced UK, French and German markets. The
surge partly reflects relief that nightmare scenarios suggesting economic
melt-down as a result of Italy's colossal budget deficit and political
turmoil have proved unfounded. Perhaps it also hints at the beginnings of a
virtuous circle whereby growing confidence leads to a firmer lira, falling
interest rates, a reduced budget deficit and blossoming equity and bond
markets.
But the Milan market already attaches a high rating to forward earnings
while the underlying economy is precariously poised. A forward multiple of
around 25 as calculated by Goldman Sachs leaves little to chance as many
industrial companies experience tough trading with Italy's largest trading
partner, Germany, slipping deeper into recession. There are bound to be more
twists in Italy's political saga which will influence the market. Investors
must hope that favourable sentiment concerning Italy's political evolution
prevails over the lingering economic worries.

FT  08 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: C&amp;J Clark/Berisford
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the showdown in Shepton Mallett resolved in favour of Clark's
continuing independence, the venerable family shoe business will not, after
all, be dragged kicking and screaming into the modern corporate world. The
decision is a boot in the ribs to Clark's managers and must bruise their
motivation. Sadly, shareholders' hopes for a harmonious future look
optimistic given Clark's unhappy history. It will be an extraordinary
achievement if Clark can rejuvenate itself sufficiently to stage a flotation
within five years.
As for Berisford International, the failure of its bid proposal must come as
a bitter blow - especially given that Clark's management had sought the
offer in the first place. But it scarcely ranks as a calamity. The company
has four other UK manufacturing businesses in the frame and hopes to firm up
one of these deals. Berisford's institutional shareholders, who were
supportive of the Clark proposal, will at least make allowance for the
extraordinary circumstances surrounding its collapse. Sentiment may knock
Berisford's shares when trading resumes on Monday, but it would be churlish
to hit them too hard.

FT  08 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Keeping insiders out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gartmore's broadside against the stock exchange on insider dealing comes at
an unfortunate time for the government. It underlines the weakness in the
proposed insider legislation before parliament. The main current problem is
not that of defining the offence which is the thrust of the new law. Instead
it is one of enforcement. There is some prima facie evidence, as Gartmore
claims, of insider dealing in Tiphook shares. But the 11 per cent fall in
its shares ahead of its profit warning proves nothing. If, as seems likely,
no firm evidence turns up, the temptation will be to dismiss the exchange's
inquiry as inadequate.
The exchange is hampered both by the limitations on its scope to investigate
and by the need for proof sufficient to secure conviction in a criminal
court. Perhaps because it was primarily designed to satisfy the bureaucratic
need to comply with the European directive, the new law ignores this
problem. Instead it originally broadened the definition of insider
information in a way that threatened to undermine the legitimate work of
corporate advisers and stockbrokers. Yesterday's redrafting goes a long way
towards redressing this difficulty, but it says nothing new on enforcement.
The exchange itself has rightly picked out two changes which would help.
Miscreants would be easier to expose if the authorities had recourse to
civil as well as criminal penalties, as is the case in the US. Investigation
conducted by one central body would be more effective. That also makes sense
given the planned expansion of the legislation to new markets such as
derivatives. The exchange's role would diminish further, but this,
presumably, is one area where it would be happy to see that happen.

FT  08 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bosnian crisis unsettles
senior bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS of possible air strikes by the US and its allies in Bosnia,
threatening European political and economic stability, and suggestions that
support in Denmark for the Maastricht treaty might be waning, unnerved many
investors yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS dived steeply after midday on a combination of negative factors: the
CAC-40 index finished down 41.92 or 2.2 per cent at 1,878.57, a fall of 3
per cent over the week. Turnover was estimated at FFr3.1bn.
Mr Simon Hopkins at James Capel in Paris commented that while most of
Monday's budget measures had largely been discounted, the market was waiting
to learn what fiscal incentives would be provided to encourage take-up of
the privatisation programme that lies ahead.
The fall yesterday may have been precipitated by disappointing first quarter
sales figures published by key blue chips, he added; although some big
pension funds were seen coming back as buyers in the post bourse. Next week
he expected a bounce off the support level of 1,870.
FRANKFURT eased on futures-led selling, amid low volumes as most investors,
cautious over the situation in Bosnia, remained sidelined. The DAX index
fell 11.34 to 1,611.92, the lowest level since early February. The index
declined a marginal 0.9 per cent on the week, reflecting dull trading.
Turnover was DM5.4bn.
Traders said shares were testing lower levels. 'We don't know if the 1,600
support will hold,' said Ms Barbara Altmann, at B Metzler.
Commerzbank was one of the hardest hit, falling DM3.30 to DM292. The bank
announced a 25 per cent rise in first quarter operating profit yesterday,
but investors were discouraged that it had lost DM200m in bad loans to
Hafnia Holdings, the ailing Danish group.
MILAN edged marginally higher, but was restrained by weakness in Fiat and
book-squaring ahead of the end of the May account next week. The Comit index
added 2.32 to 543.08, for a weekly rise of 3.2 per cent.
The successful passage last night of parliamentary votes of confidence on
the government of Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi should help to boost
the market.
Fiat, down L80 to fix at L6,601 before L6,455 after hours, was depressed by
figures showing a 28 per cent drop in Italian car deliveries in April, while
speculation continued about a sharp fall in the dividend when the company
reports on May 31.
Generali, which soared L160 or 3 per cent to fix at L38,950, edged back on
the kerb to L38,400 after hopes began to fade that the insurer would
announce a bonus issue along with its results later.
Olivetti shed L93 or 4.7 per cent to fix at L1,857, before L1,855 after
hours, ahead of the launch of its capital rise.
ZURICH was easier with Roche providing one of the few bright spots. The SMI
index shed 4.8 to 2,160.9, for a 1.4 per cent rise on the week.
Roche continued the advance that has taken the bearer shares 12.2 per cent
higher over the past two weeks. The company has received recommendations
from analysts following its announcement of annual results and medium-term
forecasts.
Kleinwort Benson commented this week that Roche was one of a handful of
pharmaceutical stocks worldwide that was in a strong position to weather the
current wave of healthcare reforms.
James Capel said that the company would grow significantly above average for
an international pharmaceutical stock over the next few years.
Roche bearers rose SFr260 to SFr7,500, while its certificates added SFr30 to
SFr4,450.
Pharma Vision, which holds large investments in Roche, added SFr160 or 4.9
per cent to SFr3,220.
AMSTERDAM improved slightly after the rate-cut with the CBS Tendency index
putting on 0.1 to 107.9, little changed on the week. The publishing sector
remained weak with Wolters Kluwer off Fl 1.00 at Fl 89.00, down some 4 per
cent on the week, and Elsevier off 50 cents at Fl 128.20.
STOCKHOLM advanced strongly on Astra and Ericsson, while S-E Banken
continued to draw high volume although the C shares closed off SKr1.50 at
SKr25.50 and the A's were down SKr1.00 at SKr27.
Astra was helped by a positive broker's comment with the B shares up SKr30
at SKr723 and Ericsson, up SKr7 at SKr299, was firm ahead of Tuesday's first
quarter results.
The Affarsvarlden general index closed 9.7 higher at 1,068.7, a gain of 3.7
per cent on the week.
MADRID lost ground amid light trading. The general index fell 1.48 to
241.29, down 1.3 per cent on the week. Banesto declined for the third
consecutive day, falling Pta40 to Pta2,060, as the bank's announcement of a
Pta130bn equity expansion plan prompted selling.

FT  08 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Deep divisions remain on outlook for
Italy - Milan's fresh start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The surge in prices in Milan this year, with shares rising by about 20 per
cent since January, has triggered deep divisions, among even the most
experienced analysts.
For the 'super-optimists', Italian equities are just at the start of a
long-overdue re-evaluation, which will see prices rising by at least 50 per
cent, as investors belatedly appreciate the market's merits.
'Evidence' that the forecast is correct is mainly political. Aletti, a
Milanese broker, points to last month's referendums, which showed an
overwhelming popular desire for change, as proof that political reform is
firmly on the agenda.
The new government of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the former governor of the
Bank of Italy, is a further indication of movement. Though distracted by
last week's defection of four ministers within hours of taking office, the
government's survival of a parliamentary vote of confidence last night shows
it is now in business.
At the other extreme are those counselling caution. Such analysts,
principally London-based, say that Italy may be changing, but it still has a
rocky ride ahead.
While not denying the real impact of the political reforms that have already
taken place, they argue that the process is still at an early stage. Hence
the referendum, the most important aspect of which was to herald the reform
of voting in general elections, must be followed by new laws.
Those will only be the first steps to new elections and a new government,
whose composition remains wholly unclear.
Inevitably, a handful of analysts take the middle ground. The team at
Albertini, a respected Milan-based house, is 'pretty bullish' about the
market, and predict that it still has 5-10 per cent to rise before a
consolidation this summer.
However, they appreciate the political minefields ahead. Mr Ciampi may
command respect, but if he practises as prime minister what he preached as
central bank governor, the 1994 budget, being brought forward to July, could
be a battleground.
The budget will contain some harsh medicine to put Italy's public accounts
in order. Although much was achieved under the previous Amato government,
the problem of the government deficit has swollen this year, as revenues
have fallen below expectations on account of the recession.
Even in its present, more reformist mood, parliament is hardly likely to
welcome even tougher spending cuts and tax rises, meaning that the passage
of the 1994 budget and possible additional measures for 1993 is likely to be
tortuous.
Who is right? While caution may be the best approach, at least until the
political picture clarifies, shares have continued rising. Foreign funds in
particular, previously underweight or wholly absent from Milan, have scanned
the headlines about political change and started buying.
Big orders, even for liquid blue chips such as Fiat and Generali, have had a
disproportionately large impact on the relatively small Milan bourse. Prices
have rocketed on the back of foreign and domestic institutional buying,
coupled with special situations such as privatisation or rumours of
impending international alliances, as in the case of Fiat.
The speed and scale of the upturn has embarrassed some of those counselling
caution, with clients chiding their brokers for not telling them to plough
in. 'People can get it so wrong,', admits Miss Marie-Christine Keith, of
County NatWest, which is publishing a big Italy study next week. 'Generali,
Fiat, Sip and Stet all look dear, but every time they weaken, big buyers
come back into the market.'
For investors looking for short-term performance and confident of timely
selling tips, there is probably still some performance left on the back of
more upbeat political news. For the long-term buyer too, the outlook seems
remarkably positive. The political picture is changing fast, and economic
fundamentals look brighter too.
The fall in the value of the lira will boost exporters, while the entire
corporate sector has been helped by last summer's agreement on abolishing
the 'scala mobile' wage indexation system. That, along with the domestic
recession, has contributed to an extraordinary slowdown in wage growth,
while inflation has remained remarkably low in spite of the currency's
plunge.
Retail price inflation was 4.2 per cent last month, while wage growth is
running at just 2.9 per cent. 'Who could have believed that as recently as
1991, the Andreotti government was giving 17 per cent wage rises to public
sector employees,' says one analyst.
It is the medium-term that looks most tricky. With a series of political
obstacles still to be crossed, the market has immense potential for
volatility.
Slightly further ahead is the debate on electoral reform, which promises to
be difficult. Beyond that are new elections, probably in the autumn at the
earliest, and the formation of a new government, based on a coalition, the
composition of which is today only guesswork. Then there is the small
question of what they will do.

FT  08 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks little moved by
jobs data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Wall Street
US share prices ended little changed in light trading yesterday in the wake
of an April employment report that provided few clues to the current state
of the economic recovery, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 4.71 at 3,437.19.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended down 0.95 at 442.31,
while the Amex composite finished 0.89 lower at 426.06, and the Nasdaq
composite up 1.40 at 681.44. Trading volume on the NYSE was 224m shares.
All week investors had been sitting on the sidelines, awaiting the April
jobs data that they hoped would provide fresh inspiration for stock markets
that were badly in need of a new direction. Yesterday's employment report,
however, proved to be a disappointment.
The news that in April the civilian unemployment rate remained unchanged at
7 per cent and that non-farm payrolls rose by 119,000, slightly less than
forecast, had no discernible impact on market sentiment.
The markets were also hamstrung by concern about developments in central
Europe. Investors seemed reluctant to commit themselves to the markets until
President Bill Clinton had clearly indicated whether the US and its allies
planned to intervene militarily to help the beleaguered Moslems in Bosnia.
Among individual sectors, tobacco stocks, which have been hit hard in recent
months on fears that a price war between the big US manufacturers would hurt
earnings, rose on the news that RJR Nabisco has decided to discontinue
offering smokers a discount on its cheapest brands of cigarettes. Philip
Morris firmed Dollars 2 to Dollars 51 in volume of 5m shares, RJR rose
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 5 3/4 in volume of 4m shares, American Brands put on
Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 32 1/4 , and Loews added Dollars 2 at Dollars 100
1/8 .
Airline stocks ran into heavy selling, undermined by reports that Northwest
Airlines had fired another shot in the air fare war. AMR, parent of
American, fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 67 5/8 , UAL slipped Dollars  1/2 to
Dollars 135 1/2 , and Delta gave up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 57 1/8 .
Gap Stores rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 33 7/8 in busy trading, after
several Wall Street brokerage houses upgraded their rating on the retailer's
stock in the wake of a rise in Gap's same-store sales during April.
On the Nasdaq market, some technology issues were in demand. Lotus
Development rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 32, Dell Computer added Dollars
3/8 at Dollars 32 1/4 , Borland International firmed Dollars 1 to Dollars 26
1/2 , and Intel put on Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 102.
Canada
TORONTO finished sharply lower in moderate dealings, dragged down by losses
in forestry stocks and other natural resource firms.
Of the TSE's 14 indices, 11 ended lower. Gold shares were among the few
winners due to continued bullion gains.
The TSE-300 Index fell 15.64 points or 0.41 per cent to 3,779.10. Declines
led advances 388 to 327 with 286 unchanged.

FT  08 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Taiwan rises on hopes of
interest rate cut

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EQUITY prices rose to their session peak in late trading, as stability in
the foreign exchange market encouraged investment trusts and foreign
investors to offset earlier selling pressure from arbitrageurs, writes Wayne
Aponte in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average settled up 189.33 at an intraday high of 20,811.36, after
trading to a low of 20,491.92, a loss of 2 per cent on the week. The Topix
Index of all first section issues ended 9.44 higher at 1,620,77 and, in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 3.336 to 1266.65.
Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was estimated at
600m shares traded, compared with Thursday's 622m. Advancing issues outpaced
declining ones by 668 to 368, with 149 unchanged.
According to Mr Takehiro Fukada, manager of securities investment at the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, the bank has decided of late to invest again
in the equity market, after a two-year absence, because the Nikkei average
and the domestic economy is thought to have bottomed. Brokers said that the
bank's view is representative of many domestic institutional investors and
individuals who, until recently, were more conservative about their
investment in Japanese equities. Chart analysts expect new money to keep the
Nikkei average between 20,000 and 23,000 in the short-term.
But market participants said that foreign exchange-rate considerations may
limit the future gains of the Nikkei average if the yen continues to advance
against the dollar. The yen closed at Y110.10 against the dollar in Tokyo
trading, after climbing to Y109.65 during early trading.
Investors bought issues in the gold-mining sector on the strength of high
gold prices overseas. Sumitomo Metal and Mining rose Y10 to Y1,060 and
Mitsui Mining and Smelting Y6 to Y556. Aoki, a Japanese construction
company, gained Y16 to Y601 on reports of its gold mine project in Brazil.
Olympus Optical gained Y20 to Y1,280 on reports that the company expects an
increase in operating profit for this fiscal year.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 58.29 higher at 22,722.58, in volume of
33.1m shares.
Roundup
THERE were mixed performances from the region's markets.
MANILA resumed its rally after a correction on Thursday as investors hunted
for cheap shares. The composite index closed up 10.41 at 1,653.91, or 3.1
per cent firmer on the week. However, some traders expect the index to peak
in the near term.
TAIWAN jumped on continued hopes of a rate cut by the central bank after
positive inflation figures announced earlier in the week. The weighted index
gained 80.94, or 1.8 per cent on the day, to 4,573.42, but posted a marginal
0.2 per cent gain from the previous week. Bank shares, which will see wider
profit margins from lower interest rates, led yesterday's rally.
HONG KONG fluctuated in a narrow range on trading of selected issues, and
closed slightly higher on the day. The Hang Seng index rose 2.82 to
6,798.34, 0.4 per cent lower on the week. Investors took profits on HSBC
Holdings, which lost HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 69, while Hutchinson Whampoa
was sought actively, rising HKDollars 1.1 to HKDollars 20.4, after reports
that its placement was smaller than most market participants had expected.
AUSTRALIA drifted down on futures-led selling after an early rally. The All
Ordinaries index fell 6.6 to 1,685.3, but gained 0.2 per cent on the week.
The gold index continued its rally and firmed 21.2 to 1,541.2 in line with
the gold bullion market. However, bank shares, strong this week, lost
ground.
SEOUL lost further ground on worries over the government's anti-corruption
campaign. The composite index retreated 6.95 to 703.85, down 2.5 per cent on
the week.

FT  08 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ratners hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another jump forward in Ratners - the shares have now doubled in three weeks
 -increased speculation that the jewellery company's fortunes had been
revived amid reports that sales had lifted in the last quarter. Analysts
were unable to obtain confirmation of any upturn because the company is in
its closed period, but added that sentiment had been lifted by management
changes.
This week, the group appointed the former Burton chief executive, Mr
Laurence Cooklin, to its board. The shares added 4 to 31 3/4 p yesterday, in
turnover of 9.2m.
Norwich Union Life Assurance Society was revealed as the big seller of Clyde
Petroleum on Thursday. The insurance company said its holding had been
reduced to 36.16m shares, or 9.05 per cent of the issued capital.
A profits warning, accompanied by news that it is offering a conditional
cash alternative for its bid for Aberdeen Petroleum, saw Pittencrieff shares
lose 20 per cent of their value, touching 302 before stabilising and closing
a net 69 lower at 305p. Pittencrieff said its 1992 pre-tax profit would be
'below expectations'. The latter moved into the market yesterday and
increased its stake in Aberdeen to 20.3m shares, or 39.4 per cent. Aberdeen
shares held at 17 1/4 p.
BP settled a fraction easier at 305 1/2 p with renewed US buying interest
said to have been offset by profit-taking in the UK after the much better
than expected figures announced on Thursday. Shell moved up 4 to 565p with
dealers noting a fresh bout of switching out of Royal Dutch into Shell.
British Gas climbed 3 1/2 to 303 1/2 p following some aggressive buying of
the shares by income funds ahead of the stock going ex the 7.6p dividend on
Monday.
Composite insurers provided two of the FT-SE 100 index's outstanding
performers in Commercial Union, 13 higher at 581p and General Accident, 20
firmer at 575p, the latter in the absence of a rumoured rights issue.
Dealers said the market had been caught short of stock after moving
insurance share prices lower in midweek, when Royal surprised the market by
launching a Pounds 404m rights issue.
General Accident is scheduled to report interims on Tuesday; analysts expect
the group to record profits of around Pounds 25m, against last time's Pounds
29m loss.
Jarvis, the London-based building and civil engineering contractor, fell
sharply after the company accompanied news of a Pounds 3.72m loss for the
year and a dividend omission with a Pounds 2.35m rights issue at a deeply
discounted 14p a share. Jarvis also revealed a series of board changes,
including the appointment of a full-time finance director. The shares fell
to 16p before rallying to close a net 2 1/2 off at 18 1/2 p.
Takeover speculation revived in Hepworth, the building materials company,
driving the shares up 13 to 373p, their best level since June last year. The
group is seen by many building analysts as a prime takeover target for
MB-Caradon, which has a range of businesses similar to those of Hepworth and
which has been seeking aquisitions since it sold its stake 25.3 per cent in
Carnaud Metal Box earlier this year for Pounds 475m. Turnover in Hepworth
reached 559,000 shares.
Marley, another stock put forward as a possible bid target for MB-Caradon as
well as being one of the building sector's longest-running bid stories,
eased 4 to 136p.
Redland extended the strong performance triggered earlier this week by the
substantial profits upgrade made by Kleinwort Benson. Redland shares jumped
17 more to 492p, a rise of 47 on the week. Kleinwort was rumoured to have
also been behind the good performance by Rugby, 6 up at 264p.
Costain rose a penny to 37p on news that it has received several offers for
its UK housebuilding operation.
AB Ports jumped 7 to 406p, following a presentation at Credit Lyonnais
Laing.
A confident statement from Hickson International helped the shares gain 6 to
236p.
Tobacco and insurance group BAT Industries rose 9 to 863p, helped by reports
that Goldman Sachs had raised its rating on Philip Morris.
Textile company Coats Viyella lifted 4 to 234p, after positive statements at
the company's annual meeting on Thursday.
Steel stockholder ASW Holdings jumped 28 to 217p after two brokers, one
considered the City's most bearish on the steel industry, increased profits
forecasts.

The market's appetite for a bid for United Biscuits shows no signs of
abating, with continued talk of a predator emerging over the weekend. Once
again Cadbury Schweppes was being tipped as the chief suspect, although food
manufacturing analysts continued to cast doubts on the speculation. Other
names being mentioned included Associated British Foods and old takeover
favourite Hanson. The UB price zoomed ahead again, closing up 8 to 429p.
Turnover was a healthy 6m shares. Cadbury slipped 10 to 443p on rights issue
fears, AB Foods added a penny to 471p, while Hanson rose 1 1/2 to 231 1/2 p.
Another name attached to UB in recent days, Grand Metropolitan, was also
rumoured to be a potential target by a US foods group. Dealers said that
there were reports of preliminary fund-raising being undertaken in New York.
GrandMet shares surged 6 1/2 to 429 1/2 p on good turnover of 6.5m.

FT  08 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI moves towards demerger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW ON the brink of its demerger, ICI shed 16 to 1243p as the tussle for the
shares gathered momentum ahead of the pricing of the Pounds 1.3bn rights
issue for the bio science arm on Wednesday.
ICI shares were hit by a bearish circular from Smith New Court which
suggested that the company should make a one-for three rights issue at 530p
a share, which would give an ex-rights price of 630p. Last week's final
unofficial 'grey' market price for ICI new shares was 590p, which would give
a full price of 1220p if the Smith valuation was accepted.
Analysts said SG Warburg, one of the securities houses involved in the
impending Pounds 1.3bn rights issue, was yesterday approaching underwriters
and institutions to float the idea of an issue at 600p a share for Zeneca.
They said this would suggest an underwriting price of between 500p and 550p
a share and an ex-rights or fairly valued price of around 700p a share.

FT  08 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares advance as new account opens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DOLEFUL trading account in the UK equity market came to a relatively
optimistic close last night, as share prices brushed off the initially
bearish effects of the government's poor showing at the polls and turned
higher as they moved into the new trading account. Early deals saw the FT-SE
Index down by 14 points, following the electoral trouncing of Mr Major's
governing Conservative party in Britain's county council polls and its rout
at an important parliamentary by-election. But, with sterling and government
bonds steady, equities had already rallied before the final hour of trading.
That final hour saw the market moving into the new trading period which
brought a wave of support.
The FT-SE Index closed 7.4 up at 2,793.7 in good turnover. Excitement was
fuelled by reports that the big securities houses were actively preparing
the underwriting on the Pounds 1.3bn rights issue of Zeneca shares, to be
priced on Wednesday as the ICI demerger moves towards zero hour. The reports
of underwriting activity alarmed the market's takeover bid pundits, some of
whom pushed United Biscuits higher in the closing minutes of the session.
At the day's low point, the Footsie touched 2,772.2 which is seen as the
extreme low end of the present trading range. Consequently, the late
recovery represented a significant reinforcement of some current strategies
in the UK market, especially as there was little encouragement from Wall
Street when it opened its new session.
At last night's close, the FT-SE 100 was down 19.4 on a week in which the
City has been slow to return to work after the May Day break. Over the
three-week account, extended to cover the holiday weekend, the London market
has fallen by about 1 per cent, largely on worries about the US economy.
Those worries have been highlighted by suggestions that big investors have
been moving into gold bullion and shares.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, again slow to follow the blue chips, closed 5.2 off
at 3,109.5 yesterday. Although 22.6 down on the week, the Mid 250 Index has
gained 1.2 per cent over the account; second-line issues have been less
exposed than the FT-SE 100 stocks to sudden swings in the stock index
futures market.
Seaq volume remained high at 614.6m shares, compared with 681.5m on Thursday
when retail business totalled Pounds 1.37bn.

LIVELIER trading at the end of the three-week stock market account produced
a firmer futures market and brisker activity in the options, writes
Christopher Price.
The latter market was underpinned by speculative interests, with some of the
equity market's favourite takeover candidates featuring strongly. Lucas
Industries totalled 2,719 contracts, with one broker selling 1,500 of the
August 140 puts at 10.5p. United Biscuits, which saw its shares rise
strongly in the equity market, was also prominent, reaching 2,217 contracts.
The top-traded stock was Asda at 3,062, with 1,901 of the October 67 puts
bought at 7p.
In the futures, the June contract opened firmly at 2,775, but slipped back
soon after, as some in the market took a gloomy view of the Conservatives'
strategy after Thursday's elections. It tumbled to 2,768 on low volume,
before rallying slowly for most of the remainder of the session. It finally
finished at 2,799, one point up on its fair value level of around 7. Volume
was an uninspiring 7,204 contracts.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Payroll weakens the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR lost about  1/2 a pfennig against the D-Mark yesterday lunchtime
after the latest US employment report turned out to be slightly worse than
expected, writes James Blitz.
However, after falling to a low of DM1.5675 against the D-Mark on the day,
the dollar bounced back as longer-term investors were attracted by the
currency's cheapness.
Dealers were also reluctant to take long D-Mark positions at the end of a
week which has seen the release of extremely poor indicators on the German
economy. They pushed the dollar up nearly  1/2 a pfennig to close on the day
at DM1.5825 against the German currency.
The headline US non-farm payroll figure for April saw a rise of 119,000 on
the month, compared to market expectations of a 148,000 rise.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economic adviser at Bank of America, said that the drop
in manufacturing employment by 65,000 on the month was a particularly
depressing feature because manufacturing growth had been thought to be
leading the US recovery.
However, the dollar's losses were mitigated by this week's particularly poor
performance in the German economy.
The March figure for industrial orders in Germany was a particularly
worrying indicator this week, dropping 3 per cent on the month.
This background explains why sterling rose 1 1/4 pfennigs against the D-Mark
yesterday, finishing at DM2.4925, despite a defeat for the UK government's
candidate in the Newbury by-election.
By contrast, the Swiss franc ended a good week on the soft side. The
'Swissie' closed a little weaker at SFr0.902 from a previous SFr0.899.
The strength of the Dutch guilder and Belgian franc this week prompted
central banks to reduce interest rates for both of these currencies
yesterday.
However, the guilder was still some 35 basis points above the D-Mark in the
exchange rate mechanism grid yesterday, threatening to breach the 50 basis
point margin against the D-Mark set by the Dutch authorities.
The Danish krone slipped sharply against the D-Mark, however, with 10 days
to go to Denmark's referendum.
The trigger for yesterday's decline was an opinion poll showing that the
number of people planning to vote 'No' in the referendum had increased from
33 per cent to 39 per cent.
The Danish currency slipped to DKr3.8545 against the D-Mark from DKR3.8450
on Thursday. Inside the ERM grid, the krone's divergence against its central
Ecu rate slipped to 42 percentage points.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Money Markets: 6 percent forever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEAPER day-to-day funds in the sterling interbank market continued to force
slight reductions in short-dated interest rates yesterday, writes James
Blitz.
However, dealers in both the cash and futures markets ended the week in the
same frame of mind as they had been at the start of it: deeply uncertain
whether base rates are going up or down.
With both the June and September short sterling contracts closing at 94.00
last night, the market was effectively saying that 6 per cent base rates are
here until late autumn. That view matched the position in the cash market,
where 3-month money closed at 5 15/16 per cent, helped by the speedy removal
of a Pounds 1.7bn shortage.
Base rates could be reduced again before the year is out. There have been
net reductions in the number of people out of work in the last two months,
but there is some uncertainty over whether these figures reflect an
underlying trend.
Moreover, if sterling continues to strengthen on the foreign exchanges, the
government might come under pressure to reduce rates to help export growth
and stimulate the recovery.
But the prospect of a rise in rates is also being discussed across the
market. The government may be able to keep inflation just about within its
1-4 per cent target band this year, but the chances of it getting back to
the bottom half of the target band by the end of this parliament are not
good.
The awful truth for dealers may be that 6 per cent base rates are unchanged
for a long time.
Mr Gavyn Davies, chief UK economist of Goldman Sachs, has published a chart
predicting that 3 month LIBOR will be unchanged between now and the middle
of 1994.
Mr Davies believes that base rates could rise if there were any depreciation
in sterling because of adverse trade figures. But he also thinks that a
tightening of monetary policy would increase the savings ratio, something
that could critically hamper the recovery.
In his view, real personal disposable income will remain quite sluggish for
some time because of house price falls and the threat of tax rises. A drop
in the savings ratio is therefore a critical element in the country's
emergence from recession.

COMMERZBANK, Germany's third biggest bank, increased total operating profits
by more than a quarter to DM651m (Dollars 407m) in the first three months of
this year, the chief executive told shareholders yesterday.
Speaking at the bank's annual meeting, Mr Martin Kohlhaussen explained that
the bulk of the growth in profits came from the bank's own account trading
activities in currencies and securities markets.
Partial operating profits - calculated before own-account trading profits
were taken into account - grew by just 2.6 per cent to DM468m. Mr
Kohlhaussen attributed this to the moderate 2.3 per cent increase in
interest earnings.
In spite of the surge in total profits, the figures showed that the
recession in Germany was beginning to catch up with the banking sector which
enjoyed a record year in 1992. Total lending contracted by 1.9 per cent to
DM163.4bn in the quarter.
The first-quarter profit figures are struck before provisions for bad and
doubtful debts which last year totalled DM2.09bn - almost as much as 1992's
total operating profits which rose 20.7 per cent to DM2.2bn.
The bank's exposure to Hafnia, the troubled Danish insurer, has alone given
rise to a DM300m provision.
The bank announced yesterday that Mr Kurt Richolt, 55, head of the bank's
Scandinavian operations and the board member responsible for this loan, was
to be dismissed. This is unusual in Germany.
Mr Kohlhaussen said that he was very satisfied with the bank's performance
in the first quarter, giving him confidence about the rest of the year in
spite of difficult economic conditions in Germany and abroad.
He indicated that the bank may hold another rights issue to follow the
DM500m issue earlier this year. He gave no hint about timing, saying the
bank would return to the market 'whenever profitable growth prospects
existed for the funds raised'.
The bank is likely to raise more capital through the issue of profit-sharing
certificates: shareholders yesterday authorised the board to issue up to
DM1bn of the certificates.

provisions

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANESTO, the Spanish commercial bank which earlier this week unwrapped a
Pta130bn (Dollars 1.1bn) capital increase, announced yesterday that
first-quarter pre-tax profits had almost disappeared following large
provisions, Reuter reports from Madrid.
The group reported a pre-tax profit of Pta808m, down from Pta17.23bn in the
first quarter of 1992.
The bank said that its profits had been distorted by the sale of Banco de
Madrid to Deutsche Bank of Germany in March.
Banesto said it had used almost its entire first-quarter profit to cover
special provisions, mostly for bad loans.
It said Pta18.09bn in capital gains from the recent sale of Banco de Madrid
had been devoted to a special fund to cover future contingencies.
Banesto said the decision reflected its intention to build on previous
efforts to strengthen the group, which included increasing equity and
stricter risk control, as well as a need to act decisively against the
effects of the economic crisis.
'In consequence, the bank has set as a priority goal that of favouring
solidity over short-term profits, by increasing provisions and allocating
the entire first-quarter parent bank profit to extraordinary provisions,' it
said.
Mr Mario Conde, chairman, announced at last year's annual meeting that a
special fund would be set up for contingencies, which would initially amount
to Pta6bn.
The Bank of Spain reached agreement late last year with Banesto for the bank
to increase provisions against growing loan losses.

FT  08 MAY 93 / International Company News: Michelin uses emergency package
as sales fall 14%
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MICHELIN, the world's largest tyre maker, has implemented an emergency
rationalisation programme after suffering an unprecedented 14 per cent fall
in tyre sales by volume in the first quarter of this year.
The company, which is one of France's largest industrial groups, has put
almost all its French factories on short-time working and has announced
plans to cut 2,950 jobs in France over the next two years and to redeploy
1,900 employees.
Michelin has completed a two-year programme of stringent cutbacks. It
reduced its workforce by 16,000 people in 1991 and 1992 to reach the present
level of just over 30,000. The group employed almost 53,000 people in 1980.
The cost cutting played a critical part in Michelin's return to profit last
year. The group, which had made losses in 1990 and 1991, returned to the
black with a net profit of FFr79m (Dollars 14.6m) on worldwide turnover of
FFr66.8bn.
The 1992 profit was achieved in spite of a fall back into loss in the second
half when the market declined and the group was hit by adverse exchange
rates.
Michelin recently warned it would be forced to make further cutbacks this
year unless the tyre market improved. The group said yesterday that after
the first-quarter fall in volume sales - which involved a 17 per cent fall
in van tyres and 24 per cent for truck tyres - it had to take radical action
to prevent stocks from rising.
The company hoped to be able to reduce the number of lay-offs by encouraging
employees to work part-time. However, it said it would resort to compulsory
redundancy to achieve the necessary cuts.
Michelin also plans a radical reorganisation of its production planning and
management.

steel unit

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KLOCKNER, the German trading house, has recorded a DM56.6m (Dollars 35.3m)
net loss for 1992, nearly twice the DM30m loss it forecast in March. This
compared with a DM74m loss in 1991.
The company said provisions of DM92.5m for its loss-making steel subsidiary,
Klockner-Werke, partly accounted for the deficit.
Klockner owns 20 per cent of the steel group and is its largest single
shareholder. The steel subsidiary filed for protection from its creditors
earlier this year. This week a local court in Duisburg opened the
composition procedure, the legal steps which fall one step short of outright
bankruptcy.
Mr Helmut Burmester, chairman of Klockner, welcomed the court decision,
which he said, provided 'optimism regarding our short-term liquidity
problem'.
Klockner's group deficit would have been limited to about DM6bn but for the
problems at Klockner-Werke, the company said.
Sales at Klockner remained stable in 1992 compared with the previous year,
standing at DM10.6bn. First-quarter sales remained unchanged at DM2.5bn.
Klockner explained that it had doubled its investments in 1992, bringing
them to DM550m. These included acquisitions in Switzerland, Italy and the US
in particular.
Klockner said it was confident about further business this year following
improved earnings and sales in the last few weeks. However, Mr Burmester
stressed a rationalisation programme was needed in view of growing costs and
uncertainties over demand.

Argentine vehicle plant

<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors plans to invest Dollars 100m in Argentina to set up a utility
vehicle plant producing 25,000 units a year beginning in 1994.
The government said GM, acting through its Brazilian subsidiary, would join
forces with CIADEA, a local car company, which will hold an undisclosed
minority stake in the venture.
GM quit Argentina 15 years ago as political unrest engulfed the country and
the economy began declining. Its return is being hailed as an indication of
increasing international confidence in Argentina's economic reforms and
proof that badly-needed investments in industry are beginning to appear.
The announcement comes as car companies in Brazil and Argentina are
increasing integration and co-operation. However, of the region's six volume
car makers, only Brazil-based GM and Argentina's CIADEA, which builds
Renault cars under licence, had failed to build a cross-border relationship.
The new GM-CIADEA trucks will be sold on the local market and exported to
Brazil. In addition to the GM investment, CIADEA said it would invest a
further Dollars 20m to expand its plant in the city of Cordoba and begin
building other GM vehicles under licence for sale in both markets.

AIR CANADA reports a large net loss for the first quarter of 1993 following
the write-off of its remaining 9 per cent stake in GPA, the troubled
Irish-based aircraft leasing group.
The company, Canada's biggest airline, has incurred a net loss of CDollars
293m (USDollars 234m), or CDollars 3.96 a share, compared with a loss of
CDollars 164m, or CDollars 2.23, a year earlier. It said operating revenues
were steady with a slightly better passenger yield. Revenues from other
business offset declines in traffic and cargo income.
The first-quarter results include a CDollars 80m write-down to cover the
book value of the 9 per cent interest in GPA. Air Canada spent CDollars 53m
buying a 20 per cent interest in GPA. As the recession began, it sold part
of this for a CDollars 248m gain. It has received CDollars 59m in GPA
dividends. 'We will not make any further investment in GPA,' said Mr Hollis
Harris, chairman. GPA is restructuring its USDollars 5.5bn debt after
shareholders refused to take up a USDollars 200m convertible preferred
issue.
Air Canada's net loss included CDollars 64m in extra provisions for staff
retirements and other special charges. The first-quarter operating loss was
CDollars 79m, before provisions, compared with an operating loss of CDollars
101m a year ago.
The company said 1,000 more jobs would go this year, over and above the 500
announced.
The new reductions applied across the board would reduce the payroll to
about 16,000 people by the year end. Mr Harris announced a broad executive
reshuffle designed to speed the drive for cost reduction and profitability.
The number of top executives would be cut to 15 from 18. All airline
operations become the responsibility of Mr Jean-Jacques Bourgeault, who
steps up from executive vice-president, marketing, to executive
vice-president and chief operating officer.
A senior executive would be based in Vancouver to develop more business in
western Canada. Mr Rob Peterson, treasurer, steps up to vice-president
finance.
Air Canada is forging operating links with Continental Airlines of the US
which it hoped would lead to extra revenues and lower costs. A plan to merge
with rival Canadian Airlines was blocked by legal process plus opposition
from the Canadian Airlines management.

FT  08 MAY 93 / International Company News: Bosch braced to be one of the
few - A leaner future for the components supplier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE top management changes at Robert Bosch coincide with increasingly
difficult business and labour conditions for the group, Germany's 10th
biggest industrial company and largest supplier to the troubled automotive
industry.
Last week, some 10,000 workers held an unprecedented demonstration outside
the company's headquarters at Gerlingen in the hills outside Stuttgart,
bussed from the company's 57 production sites across Germany to protest at
planned cuts in employee benefits.
Under Mr Marcus Bierich, the outgoing chief executive, Bosch employee
numbers have dropped by 20,000 to 170,000 worldwide over the past two years,
and are set to fall by another 10,000 in the current year. So far, these
cuts have been achieved without compulsory redundancies and employees' real
ire is reserved for a plan to cut employee benefits.
Bosch is planning to do away with a quarter of its DM1bn (Dollars 625m)
benefits bill.
This means chopping perks such as subsidised lunches, awards for long
service, spa cures and nursing cures. When combined with the below-inflation
pay rise of 3 per cent this year for the German workforce, pay will in
effect be frozen this year.
Mr Bierich, who departs at the end of the month to be replaced by Mr Hermann
Scholl, was not expected to step up to the Bosch supervisory board until his
contract ran out next year. There has been speculation that his early
departure follows board-level disagreements over cost-cutting - in
particular, disagreement with Mr Hans Merkle, the group's legendary
80-year-old patriarch.
Mr Merkle was chief executive from 1963 to 1984 and his influence over the
company remains large. More than 90 per cent of the shares in the Bosch
group are owned by the Robert Bosch charitable foundation - but voting
control is concentrated in a small holding company headed by Mr Merkle.
In an interview this week, Mr Bierich, 67, insisted that his departure at
this time was long planned. He flatly denied that he was leaving because of
differences of opinion over cost-cutting or any other issue. The
cost-cutting measures were grounded in business necessity, he said.
In the first three months of the year, Bosch has sunk into operating losses
and turnover has dropped 10 per cent worldwide, by 14 per cent in Europe and
by a much larger percentage in Germany. Turnover increased in only four
countries: the UK, the US, Australia and Brazil.
One factor is the impact of the appreciation of the D-Mark against other
currencies in recent months. Half of the group's sales (DM34.2bn last year)
were made outside Germany, but three quarters of the group's manufacturing
was in Germany. Mr Bierich said that like other German companies it had to
accept reduced margins to maintain market share in countries other than
Germany.
The main problem for Bosch is the pressure car manufacturers are putting on
suppliers worldwide - a problem shared by all the 2,000 or so German
companies which supply the industry.
Just how big a problem has been underscored by the recent arrival of Mr Jose
Ignacio Lopez at Volkswagen from General Motors. Mr Lopez, known as the
'Russelsheim strangler' in honour of his prowess at cutting costs at Adam
Opel, GM's German subsidiary, is charged with doing a similar job at
Volkswagen.
Bosch management has had a two-hour meeting with Mr Lopez since the latter
joined VW. Mr Bierich refused to disclose what was discussed in any detail.
However, he said he agreed with Mr Lopez's objectives - to cut costs via a
simplification of components - and was keen to ensure that the cost-cutting
should take place in an orderly way.
Mr Bierich confirmed that pressure on prices from car manufacturers has led
the company to stop supplying certain products. 'This was our decision,' he
said, without giving details, 'the prices were not right.'
In spite of the suppliers' increasingly severe problems, Bierich was
optimistic about Bosch's long-term future. He agreed with industry analysts
who said that the coming shake-out in the sector would be so large that by
the turn of the century there would be only 200 German suppliers left,
whittled down to a fifth of the current level through mergers and
bankruptcies.
'A few will pull through and emerge stronger than they were before, and many
will simply disappear,' Mr Bierich said, confident that as Germany's biggest
company in the sector, Bosch would be one of the few.
As a measure of this confidence, he said Bosch was unlikely to abandon its
prized status as a private company and seek a stock-market listing. 'So long
as we can finance our investments out of cash-flow, this just isn't
necessary,' he said.

FT  08 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Sedgwick seeks investors for Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEDGWICK Group, the insurance broker, is backing an initiative to attract
new investors to the Lloyd's insurance market.
Sedgwick is joining forces with Mr Michael Wade, the former chairman of
brokers Holman Wade, to form Corporate Lloyd's Membership (CLM), a joint
venture company which will offer individuals, either directly or through
other investment vehicles, the opportunity to invest at Lloyd's on a limited
liability basis.
'We aim to fundamentally change the investor profile of the market. It is
the nearest thing to selling shares in Lloyd's,' said Mr Wade, who will be
chief executive of the new company.
The scheme follows hard on the heels of the Lloyd's business plan last week,
which outlined the terms on which incorporated Names can participate at
Lloyd's.
Mr Wade said CLM hoped to form at least one investment fund which would be
incorporated as a Name and trade with a range of syndicates.
Matters would become clearer after Lloyd's publishes more detailed
regulations in the summer.
'We want to attract a wide range of people . . . from those who buy PEPs to
millionaires', said Mr Jim Payne, the Sedgwick executive who will be
vice-chairman of the new group.
Mr Payne said CLM was also keen to attract many Names who had resigned from
the market because of concern about their unlimited liability for losses.
'Many people have lost their nerve in the last five years.'
Although no figures were made available, the funds would be of a significant
size, 'We are not talking about Pounds 10m or that sort of level,' said Mr
Wade.
Sir Peter Parker, the former chairman of British Rail, will chair the new
company. Earlier this year Sir Peter and Mr Wade resigned from their
positions at Holman Wade, which specialised in providing stop loss
insurance.
The new company will work closely with Sedgwick Lloyd's Underwriting Agents,
the Sedgwick members' agency which handles the affairs of individual Names.

FT  08 MAY 93 / UK Company News: OGC flotation and placing give Pounds 78m
valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES offered in the flotation of OGC International, an Aberdeen-based
contractor which provides construction and project management services to
oil and gas companies in the North Sea, have been priced at 130p, writes
Andrew Bolger.
This gives the company a market valuation of Pounds 78m. A total of 24m
ordinary shares, representing 40 per cent of the company, are being sold.
Half will be firmly placed with institutions, and half offered to private
investors.
Last year a surge of investment in new platforms helped OGC to make pre-tax
profits of Pounds 10.5m on sales of Pounds 226.6m.
After the flotation, which is being sponsored by UBS, the UK company will
receive payment of a Pounds 6m inter-company loan from Fairhaven, the
parent, which will leave OGC with net cash in its balance sheet.
The offer closes on May 19 and dealing is expected to begin on June 1.
COMMENT
This offer has been keenly priced, but that is partly an attempt to woo
institutions, who do not like to buy into businesses controlled by other
companies. OGC has a good track record and offers an unusual opportunity to
invest directly in the North Sea, but the fact that it is controlled by Mr
Fred Olsen's Bermuda-registered company will put some investors off.
Fairhaven has promised not to sell any more shares for two years, but might
be willing to see its stake diluted through paper issued for acquisitions.
The scale and 'lumpiness' of North Sea work can make activity levels
erratic, but the impressive management team claims never to have lost money
on any contract. Removal of the Fairhaven factor could, in the longer term,
lead to a significant uprating.

FT  08 MAY 93 / International Company News: GPA to ask bondholders for debt
repayment moratorium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA GROUP is to ask formally its bondholders on Thursday for a moratorium on
debt repayments and the need to swap more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in
unsecured debt into equity.
The troubled aircraft leasing company was yesterday granted a further
temporary waiver of breaches on its banking covenants until May 17, when
more than Dollars 50m of bonds mature.
Lenders to the group, which has debts of more than Dollars 5.5bn, said a
refusal by the bondholders to grant the moratorium on debt repayments would
bring the option of examination, the Irish equivalent of administration, one
step nearer.
The bondholders meeting is being organised by Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette,
the New York brokerage house, in the US, where most of the bondholders are
based.
DLJ has already held informal meetings with some of the unsecured debt
holders.
GPA's advisers believe the bonds have been resold many times since the
original bond issue was launched last year.
One of the group's main lenders said: 'The problem in organising bondholder
talks is that by now dentists and doctors in Oregon hold GPA bonds.'
However, DLJ is confident that it has identified the biggest bondholders,
which include Cigna Corporation, Putnam Management, the mutual fund group,
and IDS Financial Services.
Some of the bondholders have had talks with Lazard Freres about their
restructuring options, which centre on a debt for equity swap.
While GPA's banks have all but given up hope of raising new equity through
the convertible preference share issue, they are still hoping for a 'white
knight' to emerge if the bondholders make concessions.
In a separate move, GPA announced that it had already promoted Mr Patrick
Blaney, chief operating officer, to its main board five weeks ago.
Lenders to the group, which have been concerned that a split could occur
between middle management, which is effectively running the business, and
senior directors involved in the restructuring, welcomed the move.

FT  08 MAY 93 / International Company News: Irish institutions rescue
Greencore placement - Dublin stock exchange issues statement expressing its
concern over 'misleading information'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLACEMENT of the Irish government's 30.4 per cent holding in Greencore,
the sugar, milling and malting group, was salvaged last night when the Bank
of Ireland and Irish institutional investors stepped in to take the 25m
shares on offer at the original price of IPounds 2.75 (Pounds 2.69).
The placement was first carried out on April 30, but came close to being
unwound after Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, announced in parliament
on Thursday that the brokers, the Dublin firm of Davy Stockbrokers, had
later informed him that they had sold 7m shares to parties connected with
Davy which had created legal difficulties.
This resulted in the suspension of Greencore's shares on the London and
Dublin stock exchanges on Thursday.
Mr Brian Davy, chairman of Davy, said that in reaching the new deal 'we
started from scratch. The new list of placees is significantly different
from the original as a number of institutions pulled out. There is now a
much larger Irish representation'. He said the Bank of Ireland had taken
9.6m shares, and Davy, or persons connected with the firm, now had no
holding.
The Bank of Ireland said last night that 'it is not the Bank's intention to
be a short-term holder and it intends to act responsibly and co-operate
fully with the company in managing the holding'. The bank's interest in
Greencore now exceeds 25 per cent.
Greencore said that it was to seek early shareholder approv-al to raise an
existing 15 per cent shareholding limit to 30 per cent, and had requested
the stock exchange to lift the suspension of its shares with effect from
Monday.
The Irish stock exchange yesterday announced that the market had been misled
in the first placement and that the conduct of Davy was under investigation.
In a statement it said 'The committee of the Irish Stock Exchange believes
that the market was trading in the shares of Greencore on the basis of
misleading information following the announcements made on Friday April 30
relating to the placing of the government holding of Greencore by Davy
Stockbrokers. The Irish Stock Exchange views this matter and subsequent
events with extreme concern'.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, attacked Davy, saying 'I deplore the
manner in which this placement took place . . . it was not done in a
professional manner.'
Mr Ahern has been deeply embarrassed by the affair, having announced on
April 30 that the placement had been completed successfully. He told
parliament on Thursday, however, that he had since been informed by Davy
that the original arrangements had been revised. SG Warburg has denied
lending funds to Davy for it to buy 2.45m shares.
Unlike the London market, Dublin broking firms act only as agents for
clients, and are not involved in market making themselves by holding blocks
of shares for later resale.
Mr John Laurie, the investment manager for Scottish Provident, said that his
participation in the placement 'would have been conditional on the placing
being completed. I would expect to have been informed if it was not.' He
said, however, that Scottish Provident would go ahead with its purchase.
Mr Des Doran, the investment manager of Standard Life also said that he
would be going ahead and if necessary would buy an additional stake.
Mr Davy said of the original deal, 'we had a profit or loss sharing
arrangement with Warburg'. Asked whether that amounted to a share-support
deal, he said, 'we decided to unravel the deal at the earliest opportunity
as we were concerned'.
Mr Ivan Yates, opposition finance spokesman for the Fine Gael party, who on
Thursday called for Mr Ahern's resignation said 'It is very important to
reestablish the credibility of the the Irish market and it is the
responsibility of the the stock exchange and the government to do this.'
Mr Ahern said that he had no intention of resigning.

FT  08 MAY 93 / UK Company News: C&amp;J Clark rejects Berisford offer - Tears
and cheers greet decision and chairman considers his future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS of C&amp;J Clark, the private shoe company, yesterday voted
narrowly against proposals to sell the business to Berisford International
for Pounds 184m.
Instead shareholders have been promised a new board structure, a
shareholders' council and a flotation within five years.
At an emotional meeting held in Shepton Mallett, Somerset, two hours of
debate over the ownership of the group ended with 34.1m votes in favour and
37.8m against the resolution to sell.
The result was greeted by tears of joy and cheers as shareholders of the
168-year-old company embraced each other.
Mr Walter Dickson, chairman of Clark, said: 'The board will now work towards
achieving agreement on how best to take advantage of the great strength of
its brands and people.' He added he would be considering his own position
over the weekend.
Shoes, the acronym for opponents of the sale, found itself on the other
foot, now supporting the new plans. It said: 'This is a vote for the future
of Clarks and its flotation in due course.'
Ms Harriet Hall said Shoes had no interest in delaying the implementation of
a new corporate structure. Mr Hugh Pym, also of Shoes, added: 'We hope that
all shareholders can now work together.'
The toe-to-toe arguments took place in the less-than-dramatic surroundings
of an agricultural hall on The Royal Bath and West of England showground at
Shepton Mallett against the backdrop of riot police and their dogs training
and tractors trundling by.
Inside the hall about 600 shareholders, many of them fifth generation
members of the founding Clark family, debated the proposals. Outside family
members put aside their disagreements and picnicked in bright sunshine.
Last night Mr Alan Bowkett, chief executive of Berisford, said he was
saddened that Clark had not accepted the Berisford proposal.
The deal would have been the first acquisition for Berisford's new
management team. Mr Bowkett said the company was in discussions with a
number of other parties and attention would now focus on these.
During the meeting debate centred on whether Clark could remain independent
and bring to an end the disagreements between shareholders which have
hampered the business. Those in favour of the bid, which was recommended by
seven of the 11 directors including the chairman, said the Berisford was the
only certain solution to the company's problems.
Opponents put forward plans for a shareholder council to direct the board on
important financial matters and a flotation within five years. Mr Dickson
said the ideas were 'excellent in principle but I do not believe they
represent a certain alternative to the Berisford proposal'.
Mr Lance Clark, a non-executive director opposed to the sale, said it was
'an idiotic time to sell'. The proposed new board structure would 'provide
the leadership and direction needed to deliver the three-year business
plan'.
He added that he and two other directors, who were also against the sale,
were now committed to a flotation. Three weeks ago they had felt it better
for the company to remain private.
Mrs Clark, a shareholder who had taken the 'painful' decision to sell, said:
'I wish I could believe Lance Clark, but I do not believe the agonising
disputes will end.'
Mr Pym said the shareholders council would 'take the squabbling out of the
boardroom and into a different forum'. Mr Daniel Clark, a former chairman,
said the Shoes proposals could lead to indefinite prevarication, an
'alternative just too appalling to contemplate'.
Earlier Mr Dickson told shareholders at the annual meeting, which preceded
the special meeting, that an improvement in the company's performance was
expected to continue. However he added: 'If Clarks were to continue as an
independent company it would be important to re-establish prudent levels of
dividend cover.'

FT  08 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Treasury expands defences to insider
dealing charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW LEGAL defences against the charge of insider dealing have been drawn up
by the Treasury to ease City fears that legislation would interfere with the
normal workings of the financial markets.
However, there will be no changes to the legislation following the
conviction of Mr Thorold Mackie, the Scottish analyst found guilty of
insider dealing in March. The case prompted fears among other analysts that
they were open to conviction for passing on information given them by
company directors in the normal course of their jobs.
The proposed new legislation, prompted by the EC's Insider Dealing
Directive, is due to enter committee stage in the House of Commons within
two weeks. Earlier drafts met with widespread criticism in the City,
prompting the Treasury to rewrite the proposals at least once.
The latest draft, due to be sent to trade associations and others in the
City yesterday afternoon, expands the range of defences in the bill.
It is intended to offer greater protection to City professionals whose
normal activities would have fallen foul of what was previously a
widely-drawn bill. Underwriters in particular feared they could be open to
prosecution.
Parts of the legislation have been reworded to make it clearer, and more
detail has been included to define more precisely what would constitute
insider dealing. Financial institutions had been concerned about when
information had been 'made public', taking it outside the scope of inside
information.
An official said the Treasury had scrapped its plan to publish guidance on
what 'made public' meant, and had decided instead to include a definition in
the act.
In future, it will include all announcements made to the financial markets
in compliance with an exchange's rules, as well as information which is
'readily accessible to investors.'
Referring to the position of brokers' analysts, the official said: 'This
legislation is substantially identical to our current law. In private
meetings, you should not give out price sensitive information. If you're in
any doubt the prudent thing to do is to ask.'

FT  08 MAY 93 / UK Company News: SBC agrees BAT cash option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATE intervention in BAT Industries's enhanced scrip dividend scheme by
Swiss Bank Corporation will now lead to all shareholders receiving a higher
cash alternative than originally proposed by BZW, the company's brokers.
BZW and SBC agreed last night that shareholders who elected for cash would
receive 33.22p per scrip share, a discount of only 2 per cent to the full
value of the scrip.
BZW will 'pass through' those cash elections to SBC, which will pay the
higher price of 33.22p. SBC only made its offer on Wednesday, and it has
taken desperate efforts by lawyers to find a way of benefiting those
shareholders who had already made supposedly 'irrevocable' elections for the
BZW cash offer.
BAT shareholders must communicate their decision on the scrip by Tuesday,
and many of the 150,000 shareholders have already made elections.
Under the original scheme, formulated by BZW, BAT shareholders were offered
a scrip dividend of 33.9p, a 50 per cent premium to the cash dividend of
22.6p announced on March 10.
At the time BZW said shareholders who wanted cash could take an alternative
to the enhanced scrip of 32.2p, free of dealing costs - a 5 per cent
discount to cover the joint broker's risk in underwriting the deal.
BAT said it was delighted that a way had been found so as not to
disadvantage any of its shareholders, which had been the group's main
concern over SBC's late intervention.
Initially BZW said SBC's timing suggested it was more interested in
'creaming off' institutional investors, rather than small shareholders. SBC
denied that, and said it would consider making similar offers for the scrips
of other companies which have followed BAT's example.
All cheques to shareholders who elected for cash will be sent out by BZW. No
fees or payments will be exchanged by the banks.

FT  08 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Pittencrieff profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PITTENCRIEFF shares fell by almost a fifth yesterday, after the
Edinburgh-based oil explorer and mobile communications company, which is in
the midst of a hostile takeover battle for Aberdeen Petroleum, issued a
profits warning.
The stock fell by 69p to 305p yesterday after the warning that 1992 pre-tax
profits will be 'below expectations', and the inclusion of a 17p-a-share
cash alternative in a revised and extended offer for Aberdeen which values
the USM-quoted company at Pounds 8.76m.
The revised offer, which Pittencrieff said was final and will close on May
28, still includes the paper offer of two shares for every 49 of Aberdeen's.
Before yesterday's share fall, Pittencrieff's all-paper offer had been
valued at about Pounds 7.7m and had been firmly rejected as inadequate by
Aberdeen.
Separately Pittencrieff announced that it had acquired another 6.62m
Aberdeen shares yesterday at 17p each, increasing its total holding to 20.3m
shares (39.4 per cent).
Pittencrieff's results for the year to December 31 are due out next week and
brokers had been expecting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 5.5m and Pounds
5.8m (Pounds 3.51m in 1991).
However Mr Terry Heneaghan, chief executive, said yesterday that results
were likely to be affected by a number of technical factors, minor
adjustments and other one-off factors, including the slower than expected
rationalisation of some of the acquisitions made last year.
However, he emphasised that 'this profit hiccup is almost entirely of a
one-off nature' and that 'going forward the company is in good shape.' In
their statement the directors reaffirmed their intention of recommending a
final dividend of not less than 4p a share.
Mr Heneaghan said the profits warning was made necessary by the need for a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing related to Pittencrieff's plan to
float a 40 per cent stake in Pittencrieff Communications, its US mobile
communications subsidiary.

FT  08 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Warburg in talks over Zeneca rights price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SG WARBURG, the global co-ordinator for the rights issue for Zeneca,
Imperial Chemical Industries' bioscience business, is testing the market
with a rights price of about 600p.
Opinions differ whether investors would be willing to accept that price. It
implies the Pounds 1.3bn issue would be on a 1-for-3 basis. If Warburg can
only achieve a lower price the issue could be on a 3-for-10 basis.
Warburg was unable to comment. However, it is understood the merchant bank
was actively talking to potential underwriters before the pricing of the
issue next Wednesday.
The bank's difficulties were compounded this week by the announcement that
the US healthcare reforms would not be revealed until the middle of June.
The industry had expected the reforms to be announced during the third week
of May. Official trading in Zeneca's shares starts on June 1.
The mixed economic indicators coming from the US, where more than 40 per
cent of Zeneca's speciality businesses are based, have also upset forecasts
for the group's results.
'Given the uncertainty, this deal will need a substantial discount,' says
one broker.
Mr Charles Lambert, chemical analyst at Smith New Court, explained: 'It's
clear 600p is too high. The dilemma is trying to work out the size of the
discount. If it's at the conventional 20 per cent, then it values Zeneca at
an ex-rights price of Pounds 7.20, which would be far too high. We reckon
that the rights price should be about 530p and an ex-rights price of 630p.'
However, some brokers believe the 600p rights price is acceptable. One
estimates that would imply an ultimate yield of 5.9 per cent, better than
the market average of 4.8 per cent.

FT  08 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Management changes sought at Tiphook -
Institutions dissatisfied with recent performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIPHOOK, the transport rental company, is under pressure from institutional
shareholders to make a number of changes to the way the company is managed.
Some institutions, disappointed by the company's recent performance, are
pushing for the appointment of stronger non-executive directors and are
suggesting the separation of the roles of chairman and chief executive,
presently held by Mr Robert Montague, the company's founder.
Mr Montague and Mr Roger Braidwood, finance director, are due to fly to the
Middle East on Tuesday to discuss these and other issues with the company's
largest shareholder, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, which holds 9 per
cent of the shares.
They are then due to meet with Tiphook's largest UK institutional
shareholder, Scottish Amicable with 5 per cent, on Friday.
Tiphook will also be asked to change its remuneration policy for top
directors. Some shareholders are concerned that last year's remuneration for
Mr Montague and Mr Braidwood, of Pounds 842,000 and more than Pounds 500,000
respectively, are too high for a medium sized company outside the FT-SE 100.
Tiphook has four non-executive directors on its nine-man board, including
Sir Charles Powell, former private secretary to Mrs Margaret Thatcher.
According to stock market analysts, institutional shareholders have been
concerned about Tiphook's trading performance and volatile share price since
the company's rights issue in 1990.
So far this year, TSB, Fidelity and Gartmore have each reduced their
shareholdings to below 3 per cent. These shareholders have been replaced
largely by US investors, who now hold at least 18.7 per cent through an ADR
facility.
Some UK institutions have raised the issue of corporate governance with the
company in the past, but concern mounted following a profits warning last
week. One large shareholder was annoyed that news of the warning may have
leaked out into the market early. This led to allegations of insider
dealing, which the Stock Exchange is now understood to be investigating.

FT  08 MAY 93 / A striking difference across the picket lines: Workers in
eastern Germany have mixed emotions about their current industrial action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I suppose we have no choice,' said Wolfgang, a 55-year-old stevedore. Until
last Tuesday, he had been clocking in since 1953 at the Neptun shipyard in
Rostock, north-eastern Germany. Then the word came from IG Metall, Germany's
powerful engineering union, that the workers, who had already been balloted,
were to start an indefinite strike in support of higher wage claims.
'We have to trust Steinkuhler,' he added. Franz Steinkuhler, head of IG
Metall, is staking his reputation on the outcome of a strike in eastern
Germany, the first for more than six decades. He wants the employers to
reinstate a contract which would this year have given eastern German metal,
engineering and steel workers pay rises of more than 20 per cent, and which
would have equalised eastern and western wages by next year. The contract,
which was signed in March 1991 between the employers, IG Metall and east
German factory managers, was cancelled by the employers in March this year
because of Germany's deteriorating economic situation.
'Its difficult to tell you how I feel,' continued Wolfgang. 'I have never
been on a strike before. They were banned. Steinkuhler says that we might as
well strike anyway so that even if we lose our jobs we might win higher
unemployment money.'
Heinrich, a colleague who started work at Neptun 15 years ago, at the age of
27, expresses greater doubts about the wisdom of the strike. 'I don't want
to be without a job and remain at home,' he says. 'My wife has lost her job
in a factory. She is now depressed. She sits at home all day. I don't want
to end up like that. I want work, not broken promises.'
Both men earn DM1,500 (Pounds 607.00) a month after tax - about half the
average in western Germany. They each spend about DM350 on rent. 'The money
does not go far enough. We pay western German prices for most things -
petrol, cars, phones, utilities, household goods. We cannot live on what we
earn,' says Wolfgang.
Both men feel confused about the goals of German unification. 'Kohl promised
jobs, a better life, real unification. But look what has happened,' says
Heinrich. 'The Treuhand (the agency charged with privatising eastern German
industry) has either shut down almost everything along the Baltic, or else
has completely cut back the workforce.
'Neptun used to have 7,500 workers before 1989. Now there's only 1,200. I
get up every day thinking I might be the next one without a job. It's very
frightening. We never had to think like this before. Maybe Steinkuhler is
right. He says we have nothing to lose if we go on strike because he says we
are going to lose our jobs anyway,' he added.
Wolfgang dismisses the argument advanced by employers that low wages will
attract outside investment and increase the competitiveness in the region.
He believes IG Metall's message that if eastern German workers accept lower
wages they will have condemned themselves to second-class status. 'IG Metall
says a low-wage economy would amount to exploitation, that we would be
treated as second-class citizens, with a second-class economy, and as the
poor eastern German cousins. We would then never catch up with western
Germany,' he adds.
Down in the southern parts of eastern Germany, the heartland of the region's
heavy industry which has borne the brunt of factory closures, workers are
similarly confused about the aim of the strike.
Maria, who is 50, used to work at a local chemicals factory, just outside
Leipzig. She now sells souvenirs in the Nikolai church, the meeting place of
the opposition groups which helped bring about the fall of the Berlin Wall
in November 1989.
As the strains of a Bach fugue echoed through the church, Maria explained
her opposition to the strike. 'We - the ossies (easterners) - have no say.
It is not we who are organising the strike. The wessies dominate the unions
and the employers groups here. It was here, in this church, where we found
our voice back in 1989. Today, we have no voice.' What bothers Maria most is
the fact that the 'ossies' are not trusted. 'Whenever we speak out, even
about the strike, they (western Germans) patronise us by reminding us of our
past, and how much money western German taxpayers are spending on eastern
Germany.'
Some of Maria's nieces and nephews have already migrated westwards. 'They
don't want to come back. They don't what to know about the place where they
were born. They hardly send a postcard,' she says.
But Manfred, a good-humoured 23-year-old young construction worker, decided
to stay. 'I used to work in a machine tool factory near Leipzig. It is now
closed. I thought about leaving. But this is my home. I found work. Had the
union asked me to strike, I would have said No. What gets me is that the
union says we should have the courage to strike. Why? To help the employers
and unions play out some stupid power game here in eastern Germany? The
wessies will soon start blaming us for the strike. They have organised it.
Not us.'
The feeling that the east Germans have not been able to voice their real
feelings about the strike was echoed by Horst, 32, who lives in east Berlin.
Unlike many of his friends who commute to west Berlin, or western Germany,
Horst borrowed money and set up an electronics store not far from Checkpoint
Charlie. 'Don't talk to me about Steinkuhler and his boys. What are they
trying to do to us?' he asks.
'I am very angry about the strike. It will deepen the psychological gap
between the two Germanies. We have to build this country together. Sometimes
I think Steinkuhler wants to keep us divided. We don't need a strike and
further job losses. We need success stories. Our self-confidence would grow.
We would find our voice. Then we might be treated as equals.'
