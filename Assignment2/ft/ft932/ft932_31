FT  08 MAY 93 / Swept apart by the torrent: Western policy towards Bosnia is
in disarray
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bosnian conflict has seen many unexpected and contradictory developments
since it began more than one year ago. But few of them have been quite as
dramatic or significant as those of the past week when the peace agreement
brokered by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen was first signed by the Bosnian
Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, and then rejected by his self-styled
'parliament' a few days later.
Those successive events appeared first to vindicate the proponents of a
diplomatic solution of the Bosnian problem, like Lord Owen himself and
members of the European Community, and, subsequently, to strengthen the
arguments of those advocating military measures, like the US.
They have, not surprisingly, had a profound influence on the discussions
held over the past week by Mr Warren Christopher, the US Secretary of State,
in the main western European capitals and Moscow, but have left western
strategy in a state of considerable disarray.
Mr Christopher's mission to Europe had a two-pronged objective: to
co-ordinate western and Russian policy on the implementation of the peace
plan and to bring them 'on side' for military measures under the umbrella of
the United Nations, if the peace plan, already approved by the Bosnian
Croats and Moslems, was not endorsed by the Bosnian Serbs.
Success on the first point was more easily achieved than expected. The US
offer to contribute about one-third of the 70,000-strong Nato-led
international force opened the way to promises of substantial pledges of
troops from Britain, France and, not least, Russia.
Pinning down the European allies and Russia on military measures, in case
the peace plan was rejected by the Bosnian Serb assembly, was altogether a
more tricky task. The allies wriggled as much as they could, while doing
their best to avoid giving the impression of a serious rift with Washington.
They did not rule out tougher measures, possibly in the form of air strikes,
but insisted that further consultations would have to be held before any
decision to embark on such a course was taken.
These differences did not matter so much as long as they referred to a
hypothetical situation. They have become much more of a threat to a united
western front and, indeed, US-Russian relations, since the Bosnian Serb
assembly rejected the plan.
While President Clinton has been calling insistently for the international
community 'to unite and act quickly and decisively', his European allies
have found another reason for delaying military action. Ironically, a
lifeline has been thrown to them by President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia,
the very man whose particular brand of Serbian nationalism provoked the
Bosnian conflict in the first place.
Only Mr Milosevic has sufficient clout and influence over the Bosnian Serbs
to bring them to heel, Mr Vance and Lord Owen have always claimed. That
proposition has been proved at least partially incorrect by the refusal of
the Bosnian Serb assembly to heed the Serbian leader's passionate plea for
approval of the peace plan. The marionettes no longer seem to react to the
tugs of the puppet-master.
Yet the clout is still there. Mr Milosevic's swift move following the
rejection of the peace plan to seal all supply routes from Serbia to the
Bosnian Serbs, except for food and humanitarian supplies, will plug a big
hole in international sanctions. It is also clear that the move is likely to
rule out the bombing of one of the obvious targets for air strikes, the
Bosnian Serb supply routes. Will the US want to go ahead in these
circumstances?
For President Bill Clinton, who is expected by the international community
to take a leading role in the Bosnian affair, the dilemma is painful. It
sometimes seems that fate deals unkindly with Democratic US presidents.
Woodrow Wilson, FDR, JFK and LBJ, even, to a lesser extent, Jimmy Carter,
all found themselves sucked into foreign vortexes when they wanted to do
much more at home.
In the case of Mr Clinton, perhaps more than any of the above, there is an
especially bitter irony. Not four months into office, elected to put the
domestic house in order and with no known desire to be tested in the
crucible of battle, this first post-Cold War president finds himself
standing on the brink of a military engagement in a distant part of the
world ruled by mediaeval passions, which are the the antithesis of
everything this very modern man stands for.
At stake for him is not only his own credibility as leader of the world's
sole remaining superpower, but that very domestic agenda by which he puts so
much store and which already is proving such a struggle to implement. For if
Vietnam killed off the Great Society and the last World War brought an end
to the New Deal, so can Bosnia prove a dagger into the heart of the many
programmes that he used to call the New Covenant.
As Mr Anthony Lake, his national security council adviser, said yesterday,
conflict is still 'avoidable.' Mr Clinton has decided what he would do, but
not yet to do it. Lining up the European allies and Russia remains an
incomplete and fraught process. But, perhaps more important than anything,
the president still has to prepare his domestic audience for the fateful
step of overseas military engagement. Put simply, his country needs to know
'why'.
The common denominator in US opinion is that there are no good options in
Bosnia. Yet, as Mr Thomas Foley, the Democratic Speaker of the House,
frequently says, there is 'an overall presumption', based on precedent, that
if Mr Clinton goes to Congress and asks for authorisation to use force he
will get it. President Bush did so for the Gulf War and President Johnson
for Vietnam, even after intense debate.
But, political wisdom also runs, Mr Clinton must first make the case for
action, which he has yet seriously to attempt. He has to lay out the vital
US interests in the region, what the objectives and duration of any military
engagement might be and even, in these budget-straitened times, how it is
going to be financed.
Both support for and opposition to the use of military force cuts across
party lines. Tom Foley and Bob Dole, the Republican Senate leader, are for
it, Lee Hamilton, doveish chairman of the House foreign relations committee
and John McCain, the hawkish ex-Vietnam POW and Republican senator from
Arizona, are against. All agree, however, that the US cannot act alone.
In the middle are countless voices preferring one option or another. Mr
Larry Eagleburger, the former secretary of state and old Yugoslav hand,
confesses himself at a loss: 'I don't think we are in a position at this
stage to be very clear about what we should do next.' The New York Times
leader column, previously red-blooded behind intervention, could only advise
yesterday that Mr Clinton first pursue 'the still shaky political and
diplomatic fronts."
Discontent with the reluctance of the European allies to fall into line is
palpable. Congressman Tom Lantos, the California Democrat, is far from alone
in deriding 'the pitiful performance of the great European powers' in
'flunking' their first test of post-Cold War leadership. Cartoonists are
having a field day with depictions of European statesmen washing their hands
of the Balkans, but inviting the US to get involved.
Yet President Clinton has made it clear that the US will not go it alone in
Bosnia. The question that must still be answered is whether the allies will
sink or swim together in the Bosnian whirlpool.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Letter: Schools must be subject to short external tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Lord SKIDELSKY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Professor Paul Black's letter ('Effective learning and accuracy in
school tests', May 4), written in reply to my article on testing (April 29),
convinces me I was right to call the Black Report on Assessment and Training
(the TGAT Report as it is known) 'utopian'. Prof Black writes that 'short
external tests are likely to give unreliable results'. This is simply not
true. However reliability is defined, many standardised number and literacy
tests have very high reliability ratings. There is always bound to be a
small element of misclassification. But has Prof Black thought of comparing
the reliability of standardised tests with the variability of 'classroom
assessments by teachers', and the cost in terms of external audit of
controlling such variability?
Prof Black's second argument that 'short and apparently simple' tests cannot
measure all 'important outcomes of learning' is correct. But would he not
agree that many important outcomes of learning cannot and should not be
tested? Would he not accept the conclusion of Alison Wolf of the Institute
of Education, University of London, in her paper Assessment Issues and
Problems in a Criterion-Based System, that criterion-referencing, of which
he has been an ardent champion, leads to 'atomised objectives in a forest of
verbiage'? Isn't that what has happened to the government's tests?
My conclusion stands: let teachers test as they please, according to Prof
Black's principles if they wish. But let there be 'short external tests' to
measure the performance of schools.

Sir, Your leader on Mr Asil Nadir's departure ('Jumping bail', April 6)
takes a too gloomy view. Having regard to earlier trials, it was always
reasonable to assume that Mr Nadir's prosecution would go the same way. That
the almost inevitable fiasco has occurred sooner rather than later may cast
a cloud over the Temple but UK taxpayers will benefit from the silver
lining. At least another Pounds 30m will be saved and there is even a
prospect of a rebate of Pounds 3.5m]

FT  08 MAY 93 / Bold fashion statement: Levi Strauss's decision not to
invest in China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Levi Strauss blue jeans may be an even more widely recognised symbol of
American values than the stars and stripes. Sticking to values that reflect
freedom and democracy is a top priority for the 149-year-old San Francisco
company, which has been making denim pants since the California gold rush -
even if it means sacrificing profits.
This week, Levi, the world's largest apparel manufacturer with sales last
year of Dollars 5.6bn, said it had decided not to make direct investments in
China and to terminate contracts with Chinese clothing manufacturers,
because of what the company called 'pervasive violations of basic human
rights'.
The decision coincides with the debate in Washington over continuing China's
most favoured nation trading status, and has fueled the arguments of those
seeking human rights concessions from China. However, the company insists
that it is not trying to influence the political process or gain publicity.
The partial withdrawal from China - where Levi continues to buy cloth and
other supplies - is the latest result of a study of the company's
manufacturing contractors outside the US to determine whether they comply
with the strict ethical guidelines adopted last year.
Levi has already pulled out of Burma, and terminated 5 per cent of its more
than 600 contract manufacturers in 50 countries, as well as demanding that a
further 20 per cent improve conditions.
In an industry noted for sweat shops and abuses of workers rights, Levi has
earned a reputation as a good employer in the US. Its labour relations are
'among the best in the industry', according to the Amalgamated Clothing and
Textile Worker's Union.
Yet like most US apparel makers, Levi has shifted an increasing proportion
of its production to contract manufacturers overseas in recent years to cut
costs. Concerns about conditions in foreign factories led to the adoption of
the guidelines.
'As we expanded our operations to more diverse cultures and countries, we
felt that we needed to set standards to ensure that our products were being
made in a manner consistent with our values, that would not be damaging to
our brand image,' says Bob Dunn, Levi vice-president and a member of the
team of managers which compiled the criteria for selection of Levi
contractors.
Levi's 'terms of engagement' for contractors cover environmental
requirements, health and safety of workers and employment practices. Levi
states that it will not do business with contractors who use child labour or
prison labour. Working hours are limited to 60 per week and wages must at
least match local standards.
Recognising that in some countries working conditions are beyond the control
of individual contractors, Levi also drew up a list of criteria for 'country
selection', which excludes those found violating the United Nations
declaration on human rights or which are politically or social unstable,
such as Peru.
'Levi is to be commended for being the first company in the garment industry
to adopt standards for contractors,' says Mr Philis Harvey, executive
director of the International Labour Rights Research and Education Fund, a
private sector group that presses for workers' rights.
From Levi's perspective, the guidelines have proved a valuable management
tool. 'The ink was barely dry on our guidelines when we were faced with a
problem,' recalls Mr Dunn. One of the company's contractors in Saipan, a US
territory in the Mariana Islands, was charged with withholding Dollars 10m
in wages from its 1,350 Chinese immigrant workers. With the guidelines in
place, Levi assessed the situation and terminated the contract.
However, Levi has faced some difficult decisions. In Bangladesh, for
example, the company threatened to close factories where young children were
virtually enslaved. 'The contractors told us that the children were the sole
source of income for their families, and that they would be begging if they
were not working,' said Mr Dunn.
A compromise was worked out. The contractors agreed to pay the children full
wages if they attended school until 14 and then came to work in their
factories. Levi is paying for tuition, books and school uniforms. 'This is a
major effort, involving training and evaluation,' said Mr Dunn.
Levi is paying a price for its principles. But in the case of China, the
costs of withdrawing - while 'not trivial', according to Mr Dunn - 'will not
be material for a company of our size. We believe that in the long term,
protecting our brand image will support our commercial success.'
As a privately held company, with most of its stock held by descendants of
Mr Levi Strauss, Levi can take a long-term view. However, a handful of
public companies are following its lead. These include Reebok, the shoe
manufacturer, Nike, the sports goods maker, and Sears, the retail chain.
'Levi Strauss has helped us to develop and implement our standards,' said Mr
Doug Cahn, director of human rights at Reebok. The company is beginning to
assess its contractors. 'I'm about to leave for a trip to China with an
audit team next week,' Mr Cahn said.
Despite short-term costs, Levi's human-rights stand in China could pay off,
Mr Harvey predicted. 'If it is recognised by the next generation of Chinese,
Levi will have an advantage in a burgeoning market,' because young people
will associate the brand name with integrity and freedom. But if Levi stays
out of China for too long it may miss out on a gold rush bigger than the one
on which it was founded: a billion people eager to adopt one of the west's
most enduring symbols.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Letter: Union and League: a north-south divide in a game
with two halves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALLAN ROGERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is a pity that John Hopkins in his comparison of Rugby League and
Union writes on the basis of his knowledge of Union. ('Two codes, one
language', May 1.)
To say that Jonathan Davies is arguably the most complete footballer of his
time is rubbish and could only come from a Union fan. At Wigan several
players have outperformed him all season - has he never heard of Edwards,
Bell, Botica, and the new rising star Jason Robinson who is still only 18.
When talking about support, no Union club exceeds Wigan, where the season's
average is 14,752. Other clubs regularly exceeding the 6,000-8,000 gates
mentioned by Hopkins, are Leeds, with an average of 11,527 spectators and St
Helens, 8,931.
If Hopkins thinks he could get consolation at Wembley's Rugby League final
for failing to get in to Twickenham he is in cloud-cuckoo land. Since Wigan
made it their second home in the mid-1980s, it has been a sell-out. We don't
need to be patronised by southern-based Union supporters with a hankering
for our highlight.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Letter: Care on African debt relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KARL A ZIEGLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Oxfam's overseas director, Stewart Wallis ('Africa needs new economic
medicine', April 6) would be better off continuing to encourage private
donations in support of Oxfam's excellent famine-relief and other
developmental work in Africa.
The charity is right to expose failed public-sector strategies; but
compounds the problem by urging Group of Seven nations to throw more money
and unconditional, debt forgiveness at often corrupt and unaccountable
ruling elites.
After recent elections in Angola, Liberia, Ghana, Zambia and Kenya, most
government officials have not improved their moral behaviour. Transparency
and accountability are still absent. Flight capital represents up to 80 per
cent of national GDPs, according to most recent World Bank statistics.
G7 nations should link long-term amortised debt forgiveness with demands for
tightly monitored, ongoing accountability by African governments. Forgiving
the debts of miscreant ruling elites will not help Africa's poorest people.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Letter: Royal Ballet in decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr M D VARCOE-COCKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his piece on the Royal Ballet's Don Quixote ('A Don without
redemption', April 28), your ballet critic Clement Crisp has written the
most devastating review of a production by a leading company that I have
ever seen.
As a regular - but ever less regular - visitor to the Royal Ballet since
1968, I believe this production is a crowning confirmation of the shameful
slide in the company's reputation.
I have friends in several foreign companies who routinely go to performances
by other companies as they travel the world but who consider a visit to the
Royal Ballet a waste of time. I am encouraging them to see the new Don
Quixote but for all the wrong reasons.
The miserable paucity of the repertoire and the pitifully unimaginative
choice of choreographers make the current Royal Ballet the also-rans of the
ballet world.
That audiences are close to full capacity is no indication of high
standards. If New Yorkers can fill 7,000 seats at two Lincoln Centre
theatres in one evening, it should not be difficult to fill Covent Garden's
2,000.
During the next 10 days my travels will give me the opportunity to see the
Royal Danish Ballet, the Royal Swedish Ballet, New York City Ballet and
American Ballet Theater. I confidently expect that each of these
performances will contain more drive, enthu-siasm, style and varied
repertoire than the last five years at Covent Garden put together.
The Royal Ballet used to be a national treasure and in most other countries
would be treated as one. This week's announcement from Covent Garden that
there will be more opera performances and less ballet (with an even duller
repertoire), simply because opera tickets bring in more money, is final
proof that the ballet company is considered a very poor second to the opera
company and that artistic achievement is less and less important.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Man in the News: A cuckoo big enough to fly the nest - Peter
Wood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From a distance, Mr Peter Wood appears as unexceptional as his name. Soberly
dressed, quietly spoken, even a little shy. He could be any middle manager
in a large manufacturing company, putting in long hours for Pounds 35,000 a
year. But close up, he starts to display a disconcerting intensity. And
there is nothing boring about what he gets paid.
Mr Wood runs Direct Line, the UK insurance company which sells policies by
telephone, and which this week disclosed a trebling of profits in the first
half of its financial year. This means that 46-year-old Mr Wood, who last
year earned Pounds 6m, is likely to be paid at least Pounds 10m.
The issue of his pay re-emerged this week amid several reports about the
escalating salaries of some British company directors. Mr Wood remains the
nation's highest-paid, but he is starting to face stiff competition. A share
option scheme at London Weekend Television seems likely to give shares worth
Pounds 55m to a group of its senior managers.
Yet there is an argument that Mr Wood is under-paid. It runs as follows.
Like Mr Bill Gates of the US software company Microsoft - who is worth an
estimated Dollars 8bn - he was the first to spot how technology might change
an industry. Mr Gates held on to his stake in Microsoft, whereas Mr Wood
sold his 25 per cent of Direct Line - potentially worth Pounds 250m - to
Royal Bank of Scotland.
When he sold in 1988, he received an unusual contract in return. The bank
agreed to inject capital into the company to fund its growth. It offered Mr
Wood a yearly bonus linked to the rate at which Direct Line increased its
assets - the insurance policies it sells. Direct Line is now one of
Britain's fastest-growing companies.
The man who has made it so excites a mix of astonishment, admiration, and in
some cases fear, from his colleagues and competitors. He occasionally gives
the impression that he is physically at war with others. Nor does he have
much time for niceties, such as pretending to respect the achievements of
others in the industry he is shaking at the roots.
'He is one of those incredibly ruthless characters who says I'm going to
take you all on,' says one former colleague. Even Lord Younger, Royal Bank's
chairman, describes his best-known director as 'volatile'. He adds: 'There
are not too many Peter Woods around. He is so unusual because he has such
tremendous drive, and an individual view about everything.'
Mr Wood has another explanation. 'To be average makes you good in the
insurance industry,' he says. With barely concealed contempt he recalls a
meeting with an executive from another insurance company. 'He could tell me
all about the worldwide airline table, but when I asked about seven specific
areas of his business he didn't have a clue,' he says.
By contrast, he knows every detail of Direct Line, spitting out figures for
'loss ratios' and 'expense ratios' in machine-gun fashion. His vision also
differentiates him in a generally conservative and slow-moving industry.
While some companies are still considering whether they should set up direct
operations, Mr Wood is hatching broader plans.
He is distinctly uncharitable about companies such as Churchill, The
Insurance Service and GA Direct, which have now copied Direct Line's
methods, even though these companies are starting to experience some
success. He says that it will take some time for them to achieve Direct
Line's levels of efficiency in processing policies.
Its advantage comes from technology, of which Mr Wood is a master. Direct
Line's information and management systems have helped it cut costs over its
rivals. Computer software helps ordinary telephone sales workers to make
decisions, thereby saving on more senior underwriters and middle-managers.
Mr Wood developed his technical skills at Levi Strauss, where he became head
of European data processing operations at 25 - and at Alexander Howden, the
insurance broker.
Mr Wood's acerbic view of the industry spreads to critics of his salary.
'They are only moaning minnies who do not know what they are talking about,'
he says.
One enigma to outsiders is what he does with his money. He lives well but
relatively modestly with his wife and five daughters in Surrey, drives an 8
Series BMW and devotes much of his spare time to tennis, which he is said to
play well, and intensely. His regular partners include Cliff Richard, the
pop singer and entertainer, and Sue Barker, the former Davis Cup star.
Yet insurance industry insiders do not regard his lack of flashy spending as
a mystery. For Mr Wood could eventually have a good use for his money. This
stems from his unusual relationship with Royal Bank of Scotland, at which he
can appear out of place. Mr Wood is hardly the grey, stolid manager whom
banks have traditionally groomed for senior jobs.
Royal Bank initially gave Direct Line backing of Pounds 20m, and has since
built its capital to a total of Pounds 90m. The bank has hopes of Direct
Line providing a steady stream of at least 20 per cent of earnings when it
approaches Mr Wood's target of being the largest UK insurer. But Mr Wood
sometimes talks as if he does not envisage being part of the bank
indefinitely.
A flotation of Direct Line might value it at up to Pounds 1bn, so Mr Wood
could have no further need of the bank's capital at some point. Both sides
insist that the relationship is harmonious, but further questions were
raised this week by the disclosure that Direct Line is to apply for its own
banking licence to allow it to sell competing products such as loans and
savings accounts.
The more Direct Line starts to look like a bank in its own right, the more
investors will question when the cuckoo in the nest will fly away. Some of
the bank's managers point out that the decision on whether Direct Line will
go solo is not Mr Wood's, and that if he left, the bank would retain the
company's name and its assets. But this may be to overestimate the value of
the Direct Line brand without Mr Wood's direction.
Lord Younger makes soothing noises about such speculation, and about whether
Mr Wood is out of place in a bank. 'He might not have fitted 10 years ago,
but he fits very well with what we are trying to achieve now,' he says. He
is adamant that the bank deserves to reap the rewards of Direct Line through
continued earnings since it found the original capital.
Mr Wood says he is happy to be part of the bank, but the idea of a split
does not seem to worry him. 'It would cost them an awful lot of money to get
rid of me,' he says. He could have saved a lot more by the time it came,
enough perhaps to start another business with his own capital. There are
other industries which he could yet shake up.

FT  08 MAY 93 / No hiding place for Major: English voters have taken their
revenge on the government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major should not be too surprised. For nearly a year his government
has been tearing itself apart over something called Maastricht while the
rest of the country endured the ravages of the recession. The voters were
bound to take their revenge.
But after one of the worst nights for a Tory government in living memory,
that will be scant consolation for his embattled administration. The prime
minister's fragile political authority has suffered another blow. His party
shows every sign of panicking. It was not only his enemies who were using
words like 'dreadful' yesterday.
The losses were much heavier than even the pessimists in 10 Downing Street
predicted. The 33 per cent fall in the Conservative vote in Newbury was the
largest the party had suffered in any by-election since the second world
war. A Liberal Democrat majority of, say, 5,000 would have surprised few.
The 22,000 margin won by Mr Paddy Ashdown's party was a shock.
The government's paper majority in the House of Commons has been reduced to
19. The fractious mood among the malcontents and the disenchanted on the
Conservative backbenches means that in reality it cannot rely even on that.
The county council elections reduced the once-Tory shires to the Tory shire.
Essex man and woman have had enough. So, too, have their tweed-suited
counterparts in the English heartlands of Surrey, Berkshire, Hampshire and
Sussex.
It may well be that in two years we will look back on the results as a
classic mid-term aberration: a protest vote by a badly bruised electorate
rather than a declaration that it intends to boot out the government in the
subsequent general election.
There are crumbs of comfort for Mr Major. The resurgence of the Liberal
Democrats - a triumph for Mr Ashdown after a year in the wilderness - was a
potent reminder of how the Conservatives may still profit from a divided
opposition.
The collapse of the Labour vote in Newbury to the lowest recorded in any
constituency for more than 50 years may have been a predictable by-product
of tactical voting. But a respectable showing in the shire counties provides
little evidence that Labour has re-established its claim as a
government-in-waiting.
So the national and local results have rekindled speculation that the two
main opposition parties will be driven inexorably towards some kind of pact
at the next general election.
Mr Ashdown, taking full advantage of his party's return to the political
sunlight, is already speaking of the need for a change in the 'culture' of
opposition politics. The habit of co-operation at local level will
strengthen its case.
The message will not be lost on those in Mr John Smith's shadow cabinet who
believe an informal deal with Mr Ashdown is vital to avoid a fifth
consecutive general election defeat. But for all the inevitable speculation,
there is no sign yet Mr Smith is ready to give up his hope of winning alone.
If there is to be another Lib-Lab pact it will be born of opposition
desperation not of Tory defeat.
The economy is on Mr Major's side. Scalded by their misplaced trust in April
1992, the electorate declined this week to believe that a vote for the
Conservatives on Thursday would underpin economic recovery on Friday. But by
any objective analysis the recession has ended. It is a fair bet that six
months from now, voters will feel a great deal more comfortable; and Mr
Major is only one year into the parliament.
But the hope that history will take a kinder view of this week's humiliation
will not make life any easier for him in the short term. It is just possible
 -not yet probable - that the rout could be the catalyst for another loss of
collective nerve in the Tory party. If that were to happen, the prime
minister's own position would be questioned.
His most immediate problem is to restore an appearance of authority. His
government's strength is being sapped by the continuing battle over the
Maastricht treaty.
Downing Street is probably right when it claims that the latest climbdown
over the social chapter will not in the end disrupt ratification of the
treaty. But the threatened legal challenge from Tory Euro-sceptics will keep
open the wound.
Mr Major can no longer escape the pressure for the radical shake-up of his
cabinet which he has avoided since the debacle last September of sterling's
exit from the European exchange rate mechanism. In recent weeks, only Mr
Douglas Hurd has stood out as a figure of calm authority.
Mr Norman Lamont's hold on the chancellorship looks more precarious than
ever. His characteristically irreverent comment during the Newbury campaign
 -Je ne regrette rien - has come back to haunt him.
The prime minister has not made up his mind about a reshuffle. Until
yesterday his inclination was to avoid one. He will be careful not be seen
to be stampeded into instant changes. But his friends believe the risks of
keeping on Mr Lamont now outweigh the threat that the chancellor might not
go quietly. They want a late July reshuffle.
Those looking at potential successors should add Mr Malcolm Rifkind to the
list of names at present headed by Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Michael Howard.
Whatever he decides, Mr Major must also confront a more fundamental problem.
The government's authority will be restored only when he establishes the
identity which has so far eluded it. What is Majorism? Until it is answered
it remains a dangerous question for the prime minister.
The mix of free-market economic orthodoxy and caring Conservatism which he
offered at the general election has been lost in the recurrent crises of the
past year. A catastrophic increase in public borrowing has driven him to
contemplate an assault on the welfare state that even Lady Thatcher shunned.
But his promise yesterday to listen to the electorate must push him in
another direction. Resentful voters cannot be expected to greet with
enthusiasm cuts in state pensions or benefits provision or the introduction
of new charges in the National Health Service.
Nor do the promised privatisation of British Rail or the deregulation of
London's buses seem likely to persuade voters that Mr Major represents the
kind face of Thatcherism.
His friends believe that the government will now have to rethink its agenda
 -starting with the legislative programme for next year. The prime minister
needs to reassert his image as an instinctively centrist leader. A starting
point might be to end the chaos in the schools by reaching a compromise with
the teachers in the dispute over tests.
A Pounds 1bn-a-week public borrowing requirement will not allow any
relaxation of public expenditure constraints. But the more radical
suggestions emerging from the Treasury's review will have to be
unceremoniously dropped.
It would be fatal to panic now. Past form - remember all those predictions
of impending catastrophe during the general election campaign - suggests Mr
Major will not. Economic recovery will prove a potent balm. But after this
week's humiliation the prime minister might pause to reflect also that there
is no iron rule of politics that says governments always, but always, regain
their balance.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Leading Article: The electorate strikes back
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FULL measure of Conservative disenchantment with the government elected
in April 1992 became apparent this week. On Thursday the voters of Newbury
returned a Liberal Democrat in what was previously regarded as a safe Tory
seat. The 'swing' - the transfer of support from Tory to Liberal - was not
the highest in the history of postwar by-election upsets, but at 28 1/2 per
cent it exceeded the benchmark established in a similar dramatic reversal of
fortune at Orpington 31 years ago. In the local elections Tory councillors
were swept out everywhere. They lost especially badly in the shire counties
of the south-east, the Conservative party's natural homeland. As the prime
minister said yesterday, the people have given the government 'a bloody
nose'.
It is possible to offer a charitable interpretation of these results.
Homeowners in the south-east were particular beneficiaries of the Thatcher
boom of the 1980s. House prices soared; most voters did not notice that
their apparent gain was largely the product of inflation. Increases in
property values were more apparent than real. When Mr John Major became
prime minister he set himself the creditable task of reducing inflation. He
has succeeded, but at the cost of prolonging the recession and attracting
the opprobrium of Conservatives who were previously enriched but now see
themselves as the victims of the government they put in office. Yet no prime
minister who sought to conquer inflation could have done anything different.
Dismal ratings
This explanation of Thursday's election results is fine so far as it goes,
but it is not the whole story. According to a Gallup poll in yesterday's
Daily Telegraph, Mr Major presides over the most unpopular government since
1945. Its approval rating has fallen below 20 per cent for the past seven
months in a row. This is a worse score than that recorded by the then Mr
Harold Wilson's administration during the depths of its unpopularity in
1968, and far worse than the record of the Callaghan government at the
height of the 1976 devaluation crisis. According to Gallup, the public
regards Mr Major's government as ineffective, short-sighted, incompetent,
divided, out of touch, weak, and unaware of what it is doing. A fairer
characterisation would be that it is not all of those things all of the
time. The prime minister inherited a poor hand of cards. With the best will
in the world it has to be said that on occasion he has played it badly.
Small comfort
In consequence the country has a government that it does not respect - and
an opposition that it does not trust. It chose the government rather than a
Labour administration a year ago, when the recession was biting hard and the
green shoots of recovery were figments of the chancellor's imagination.
People are now saying that they would vote for a Labour administration, but
in Newbury the Labour candidate lost his deposit. It was to the Liberal
Democrats, the traditional vehicle for mid-term protests, that the unhappy
voters turned. Labour did well in the local elections, but the Liberal
Democrats did better.
It is for this reason that the government can comfort itself with the
thought that, in spite of everything, it will not be turfed out when the
next general election comes. By that time boundary changes favouring the
Conservatives will be in place. The economic recovery should be well under
way. The Labour party may look less anaemic than it does today, but the
non-Conservative vote will still be split, going to Labour in Scotland and
the North and the Liberal Democrats in the south. Even if the two parties of
opposition agree to work together, many voters will not be tempted, unless
Labour has by then won their trust. Meanwhile, Mr Major is in for a bumpy
ride.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Sharing out the spoils: John Authers says councillors will
learn to co-operate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
English county councils are entering a new age of uncertainty. The signs
are, however, that it could pave the way for an era of co-operation, guided
by opposition to Conservative central government.
A record number of counties - 26 - have no overall party control. In most
cases, the largest parties will seek to form the local administration, and
then look for support from other councillors. Parties are unlikely to make
formal pacts.
The Liberal Democrats now comprise the largest group in nine councils where
there is no overall majority. They will expect to be recognised as the
policymakers in all of them - as will Labour in the eight hung counties
where they have the largest representation.
The Liberal Democrats hope that the results will usher in a coalition style
of local government along European lines, while Labour describes speculation
about 'Lab-Lib agreements' as 'basically legitimate'. Mr Andrew Stunell,
political officer for the Liberal Democrat Councillors, said: 'There will be
a number of Labour politicians who are having to come to terms with what it
will be like if we have a reformed constitution based on proportional
representation. It's the norm in the rest of Europe.'
Party leaders will look for support generally on an issue-by-issue basis.
This is the approach of Mr David Rogers, leader of the Liberal Democrats in
the hung council of East Sussex, formerly Conservative. He does not expect
any formal arrangements.
He made clear that the chances of an informal link with Labour were high:
'The Conservatives' credibility as a member of the administration has been
damaged.'
Mr Ken Bodfish, the Labour leader in East Sussex, seems to have similar
priorities. He says his responsibility is 'to ensure that there is a
non-Tory county council', where the Tories still form the second-biggest
party.
This sentiment is echoed in other hung counties where the Liberal Democrats
have replaced the Conservatives as the largest group. In West Sussex, Labour
leader Mr Arthur Pegler foresees a return to the non-partisan days when the
council was run by independents. He has no intention of entering into a
formal pact with the Liberal Democrats, and does not dispute their right to
govern.
Labour will make up its mind on individual issues, but Mr Pegler said:
'There is no difference between us and the Liberal Democrats on the most
important things, such as the provision of social services, schools, the
environment and the maintenance of roads.'
Lib-Lab arrangements of different kinds might also arise in counties where
the Conservatives remain the largest party, such as Norfolk, where they lost
overall control for the first time since 1888. Labour is talking to the
Liberal Democrats about opposition to the closure of village schools, rural
policies, and applications for EC aid. Their hopes of engineering a change
in county policies are high.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Doubts about US recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PITY POOR Mr Bill Clinton. He is held responsible for everything, but is so
hemmed about in what he can do. This is particularly true of economic
management, which is one reason why even a 'domestic' president finds
himself drawn to the pleasures and pains of foreign policy activism.
How difficult a president's life can be is shown by the reaction to just
three months of subdued economic growth. Provisional estimates suggest that
the economy grew at an annualised rate of 1.8 per cent in the first quarter
of 1993. But this followed growth at 4.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of
1992, which means that average growth in the two quarters was 3.3 per cent.
This would seem to be perfectly satisfactory. But Mr Ron Brown, the commerce
secretary, responded to the news by saying that the economy was growing at
'an unacceptably low rate'.
As is usual in almost any recovery, the signals are confusing. Yesterday's
announcement on employment in April, for example, showed a constant
unemployment rate and an increase in non-farm employment of 119,000, which
was somewhat less than generally forecast. Earlier in the week it was also
announced that the March index of leading indicators had shown a fall of 1
per cent, while there was also a sharp decline for April in the widely
followed Purchasing Managers' Index.
Yet the Federal Reserve's latest beige book survey of regional economic
conditions had been more optimistic. It cited a 'modest improvement in
economic conditions across much of the nation' last month, following a dip
in activity in March, which was caused mainly by severe winter weather.
Manufacturing output, retail sales and home sales were all said to be
improving.
Halting expansion
All in all, after eight successive quarters of growth that have followed
what was only a mild recession, there is nothing in this performance worth
getting particularly worried about. As Mr Greenspan has often pointed out,
this was always likely to be halting recovery in an economy that was weighed
down by debt.
There is also rather little the authorities can do to help. Monetary policy
is already as loose as can be imagined. The administration may blame Senate
republicans for blocking its plans for short-term fiscal stimulus worth
Dollars 16bn (Pounds 9bn). But the loss of such a marginal amount of fiscal
pump priming can only be a convenient excuse for a baffled administration,
not a plausible reason for economic sluggishness.
Rather more plausibly, the president responded to the latest index of
leading indicators by arguing that it reinforced the case for enactment of
his deficit-cutting bill. This package might help reduce long-term interest
rates, or at least keep them as low as they already are. But the modest
scale of Mr Clinton's proposed deficit reduction means that their enactment
would not make all that much difference.
What seems to have been affecting the US economy most is the recession
abroad. Last year US exports defied recessionary forces, growing at a real
rate of about 6 per cent. But in the first quarter they contracted at an
annual rate of 7 per cent relative to the fourth quarter.
European recession
Given the combination of domestic recession with a current account surplus
in the year to March at Dollars 126.1bn, which is also about 3 per cent of
GDP, Japan is already under strong US pressure to boost its economy still
further. Its close political and economic relationship to the US ensures
that Japan is likely to yield to that pressure, however reluctantly.
While this would give the US a part of what it wants, there is still the
little matter of the European recession. France has managed to lower its
interest rates, as credibility of the franc parity has increased, but the
pace of Germany's monetary easing remains glacial. This week the six German
official research institutes called for faster reductions in interest rates.
They believe that their forecast of a 2 per cent decline in west German GDP
between 1992 and 1993 justifies a firmer step on the accelerator. The
Bundesbank remains unpersuaded.
Fortunately for Mr Clinton, the US economy is not that obviously becalmed.
He is fortunate because there is little he could do about it. US exports
depend on the whims of the foreign exchange markets and recalcitrant foreign
powers, such as the Bundesbank. US domestic sales depend on his fellow
citizens and equally recalcitrant powers, like the Federal Reserve and,
above all, Congress. Mr Clinton is learning the same lesson as Mr Bush. The
president's responsibility for the fate of the US economy is as burdensome
as his ability to change it is small.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Tax ruling hits BES investors
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   THREE LONDON securities houses
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster Bank in conjunction with Hambros Bank, and BZW - may
have to repay more than Pounds 50m to investors, after the Inland Revenue
ruled this week that shares in their loan-backed Business Expansion Scheme
companies were not issued in time to beat the deadline announced in the
Budget.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said that shares in BES companies had to
be issued to shareholders by midnight before the Budget if loans were to be
made against them.
Non-recourse loans allowed investors to exit from their investments after
only six months instead of five years, while retaining full BES tax relief
at their top marginal rate. This was intended to be on offer only to those
who maintained their investment for five years.
BZW has been invited by the Inland Revenue to discuss the matter next
Tuesday.
NatWest said that if the matter was not resolved, it would go to court to
challenge the Inland Revenue ruling. BZW said it would wait until the
outcome of its meeting with the Revenue before making the decision on legal
action.
BZW's Gracechurch companies were launched at the end of February and raised
their full subscription of Pounds 25m within a week. NatWest's Homeshare
scheme was launched in the first week of March and raised the full
subscription of Pounds 25m within two days.
Until the Revenue's decision this week it was unclear whether the shares had
technically been issued. The Revenue had said earlier that a share was
normally regarded as having been issued when the shareholding has been
listed in the company's register of members.
Both companies face the possibility of having to buy back the shares as well
as paying all the associated costs.
The schemes initially offered a rate of return equivalent to an annualised
return of 30 per cent, which is very difficult to achieve without using tax
relief.
In its letter to its Homeshare shareholders this week, NatWest said that it
was 'examining alternative mechanisms to assist' investors who expected to
have access to their capital within six months. It said that 'even if legal
action has not been concluded satisfactorily by September 1993, such
investors will receive at least an amount equal to their original
investment'.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Lloyd's hopes scheme will settle Names row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES OF reaching a negotiated settlement to the legal problems dogging the
Lloyd's of London insurance market rose yesterday following the publication
of a report prepared by a special market committee.
The committee's chairman, Mr Neil Shaw, who leads a group of Names - the
individuals whose capital backs underwriting - said he was confident that
the proposal to establish a new Lloyd's company to negotiate legal actions
on behalf of Names was 'a runner'.
Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, who appointed the committee, said there
were problems with the proposals but negotiations would continue.
Several thousand Lloyd's Names have either taken action or are planning
action against the agents who handle their affairs to recover over billions
of pounds of insurance losses.
Lloyd's is keen to reach a negotiated settlement to the litigation in order
to make the market more attractive to new investors.
Mr Shaw's committee has been examining the possibilities of a deal between
Names and the errors and omissions (E&amp;O) insurers, which cover agents
against legal awards.
E&amp;O funds available for a settlement of actions by four groups of the
biggest groups of lossmaking Names amount to between Pounds 690m and Pounds
940m, compared to estimated claims of Pounds 1.8bn, the report says.
The report proposes that a new Lloyd's company - Recovery - should be
created to take over the legal rights of Names and seek to negotiate a deal
or arbitrate a settlement with the E&amp;O insurers. Alternatively it would
conduct legal action on Names' behalf.
Names would be offered credits by Lloyd's to take part in the scheme.
Mr Middleton warned yesterday that it was 'less than a simple matter' but
said 'at least we have something to work on. We are seeing whether we can
find a framework. I am reasonably confident we will be able to establish an
acceptable process.'
The scheme's biggest flaw surrounds the possible failure of arbitration or
negotiation efforts, he added.
'If we go to litigation we would find ourselves taking legal action on
behalf of one group of Names (those taking the legal action) against another
group (those who are members of the syndicates offering E&amp;O cover),' he
said.
Mr Shaw, who also chairs the Association of Lloyd's Members, which
represents several thousand Names, said: 'The proposal may not satisfy
everybody but Lloyd's will end up with a route forward.'
Mr Middleton said he had devoted most of the past week to the issue and had
had a 'useful' meeting with E&amp;O insurers on Tuesday. He was expecting to
meet the leaders of Names' Action groups, which are co-ordinating legal
actions, on May 17.
Mr David Rowland, chairman, said last week that Lloyd's might be prepared to
contribute a 'modest' additional sum to make a settlement possible.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Prescott, Labour's transport spokesman, pictured in Liverpool
yesterday, warned the government that the UK's merchant shipping fleet could
collapse without state help for ports and shipbuilding areas.
Mr Prescott, launching a campaign to safeguard the industry, said: 'The
British merchant fleet faces complete extinction. We have one last chance to
prevent the total elimination of our fleet, a message which our campaign is
designed to bring home to the government.'
He called for regional maritime zones to be set up and for aid to be
targeted at major ports and shipbuilding areas.
The UK has slipped from fourth to 18th in the world's shipping league since
1979 and the merchant fleet has declined from 41m tonnes to 3m.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Dahrendorf quits as Independent chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR RALF Dahrendorf has resigned as chairman of Newspaper Publishing,
publisher of The Independent and Independent on Sunday, blaming his
departure in part on the company's failed attempt to buy the Observer.
Sir Ralf, appointed chairman in February 1992, resigned on Monday, a few
days after The Guardian announced that it had beaten Newspaper Publishing in
its bid to win ownership of the Observer.
Sir Ralf did not think it was right for Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, chief
executive and editor of The Independent, to buy the liberal Sunday newspaper
and effectively close it down as a separate title.
In a tough resignation letter Sir Ralf, a former head of the London School
of Economics and now warden of St Antony's College, Oxford, was also
critical of the management style of the company under Mr Whittam Smith.
Sir Ralf made it clear to friends even before the resignation letter that he
did not approve of an authoritarian rather than collaborative style of
management.
He has made it clear that he was increasingly out of sympathy with the
political line of The Independent, which he found too right-wing. It is
believed the distinguished academic found the more left-of-centre
Independent on Sunday more to his taste.
The Independent carried a five-line announcement yesterday that Sir Ralf had
resigned but gave no explanation and no hint that fundamental disagreements
were invol-ved.
Mr Whittam Smith declined to discuss Sir Ralf's resignation yesterday or the
reasons for it. He said however that a successor would be announced soon.
'We're not quite there yet,' said Mr Whittam Smith, who is also criticised
in Paper Dreams, a book by Mr Stephen Glover, a fellow founder of The
Independent, which is about to be published.
Mr Glover resigned amid rows about the integration of The Independent and
Independent on Sunday.
Mr Whittam Smith denied rumours that his attempt to make an increased bid
for The Observer had been blocked by El Pais of Spain and La Reppublica of
Italy, the largest shareholders in Newspaper Publishing. He said he had made
a bid for the Observer and stuck to it.
Sir Ralf Dahrendorf was understood to be particularly close to the
continental European shareholders of Newspaper Publishing.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Plan for 999 calls set to be rejected
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A PLAN to place the 999 emergency service in the hands of a new agency
operated by three telephone centres is set to be rejected by Oftel, the
telecommunications watchdog.
A report by consultants Touche Ross concluded that only 'limited' benefits
were to be gained from replacing the existing system by which 999 calls are
dealt with at more than 80 centres nationally.
The change to a centralised system was recommended by an earlier Oftel
review of the 999 service, set up in 1989 to examine its future in the light
of there being more than one telecoms operator. All telecoms companies are
obliged to provide free emergency calls.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Tebbit warns of rejoining ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD TEBBIT, the former Conservative cabinet minister and party chairman,
claimed yesterday that the Maastricht treaty would result in sterling being
dragged back into the European exchange rate mechanism 'before long', Ivor
Owen writes.
Lord Tebbit said: 'I believe that could provoke a political crisis.'
Lord Tebbit joined Mr William Cash, a leading Euro-sceptic in the Commons,
in repudiating the view of Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the
Treasury, who on Tuesday reaffirmed that there was no obligation under the
treaty 'to work towards fixed exchange rates or membership of the ERM'.
Lord Tebbit, speaking at the launch of a pamphlet on the Maastricht treaty,
written by Mr Martin Howe, suggested the votes of crossbench peers could be
decisive when the campaign for a referendum is taken up in the Lords.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Motor industry seeks to dismiss April sales fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECOVERY in new car sales faltered last month with registrations falling
by 1.9 per cent, the first year-on-year decline in seven months.
The motor industry said that the April comparison might be misleading, since
new car sales have risen year-on-year in 10 of the last 13 months.
Sales in April last year were inflated by customers who had delayed
purchasing in the early months of the year.
Car tax was halved in the 1992 Budget, which helped to fuel a 9.1 per cent
rise in car sales in April 1992, the first year-on-year increase in 30
months and the first sign that the severest recession in the car market in
the post-war period was ending.
Mr Roger King, public affairs director of the Society of Motor Manufacturers
and Traders, said: 'We believe we are still on course for an increase of
between 5 per cent and 10 per cent for the whole of 1993, but in line with
the state of the general economy the new car market continues to be rather
fragile.'
New car registrations in April fell to 135,469 from 138,106 in the same
month a year ago, figures released yesterday by the SMMT show. Sales of
588,730 in the first four months of the year were 8.2 per cent higher than
in the corresponding period a year ago.
Registrations of new commercial vehicles remained depressed with a 1.7 per
cent decline in April, the third year-on-year fall in three months. In the
first four months new commercial vehicle registrations at 67,171 were still
4.5 per cent lower than in the corresponding period a year ago.
The main weakness in the commercial vehicle sector is in the van market.
Registrations of trucks and buses rose modestly in the first four months.
Japanese makes are gaining ground in the new car market, helped by the rapid
growth of sources of supply outside Japan.
Nissan, Toyota and Honda are produce cars in the UK. Toyota and Honda both
ship cars to the UK from the US and Nissan and Suzuki supply the UK from
plants in Spain. Mitsubishi has started to export cars to the UK from
Australia.
Japanese makes won 14.3 per cent of the new car market in April, up from
12.2 per cent a year ago. The Japanese share in the first four months rose
to 12.7 per cent from 11.4 per cent a year earlier.
Ford, the UK car market leader, saw registrations fall 12.3 per cent in
April, depressing its market share to 21 per cent from 23.5 per cent a year
ago. Its share in the first four months fell to 22.4 per cent from 23.8 per
cent a year ago, but its fortunes should be boosted by the recent launch of
the Mondeo family car, the replacement for the Sierra.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Labour sacks Lord Desai for contradicting policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD DESAI, Labour's economic spokesman in the Lords, has been sacked for
undermining the shadow cabinet's policy by advocating the abolition of
zero-rated value added tax on some goods.
Lord Desai, who also speaks on health, was sacked within 24 hours of his
views being quoted in the Commons by Mr John Major, the prime minister, as
he moved to blunt an attack by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader.
Mr Smith had joined Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, in harrying the
government over breaking election pledges by imposing VAT on domestic fuel
and suggesting that its extension to food, transport, newspapers and
children's clothing could be the next step.
The prime minister responded by quoting an article by Lord Desai in the the
leftwing Tribune newspaper in which he argued the case for ending the zero
rate of VAT.
Lord Desai's views were also quoted by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, who
contended that Labour had one taxation policy in the Commons and another in
the Lords.
It was the second time in six weeks that the prime minister had used Lord
Desai's views to wrongfoot Mr Smith.
This was stressed yesterday by Lord Richard, the Labour leader in the Lords,
when, in response to pressure from shadow cabinet colleagues, he took the
unusual step of dismissing Lord Desai from his frontbench team.
Lord Desai, a professor at the London School of Economics who was made a
life peer in 1991, said he readily accepted that he should return to the
back benches.
Lord Desai's views on health as expressed in the Lords have not always
coincided with those of Mr David Blunkett, the shadow health secretary.
Lord Desai was recently accused of departing from official policy by
expressing broad support for the government's proposals to curb expenditure
on drugs by extending the list of products not available for prescription on
the National Health Service.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Unit trust group fined Pounds 75,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAUTRO, the life insurance and unit trust regulator, has fined Prosperity
Life Assurance and Prosperity Unit Trust Management Pounds 75,000.
The fine relates to the 'churning' of investments by All Saints Financial
Management, an appointed representative of Prosperity. The 'churning'
consisted of more than 70 investors being persuaded to purchase
single-premium life insurance bonds, and to cancel existing bonds when doing
so was not in their interests.
Prosperity has paid about Pounds 750,000 to those investors in the form of
compensation. The investors received the value of their holdings before the
'churn' took place, plus interest. Prosperity has also severed its
relationship with All Saints.
Lautro, however, said Prosperity 'had failed to take all reasonably
practicable steps to monitor the business sold through its appointed
representative.' Its disciplinary committee considered the evidence
'demonstrated a serious breach of the Lautro rules'. In addition to the
fine, Prosperity has to pay the costs of the hearing and the investig-ation.
Mr Nigel Herrick of Prosperity said: 'We accept the Lautro verdict and we
are now more vigilant in checking business from authorised representatives.'

FURTHER DELAYS emerged yesterday in the implementation of new rules
requiring companies to increase pensions in line with inflation.
Ms Ann Widdecombe, social security minister, said limited price indexation
(LPI) rules under the 1990 Social Security Act would not be implemented
until the European Court of Justice decided on equalisation of pension ages.
The rules require company pension schemes to use any surplus to increase
pensions annually by either 5 per cent or the retail price index, whichever
is lower.
Speaking at the annual conference of the National Association of Pension
Funds in Harrogate, Ms Widdecombe admitted that even after the European
Court decision the rules would be further delayed pending a 'period of
consultation'.
The Confederation of British Industry has called on government to abandon
LPI, arguing that it will cost too much.
Acknowledging the concerns of employers, Ms Widdecombe said that while the
government was committed to LPI, 'We are prepared to listen to people's
concerns.'
If necessary, the government would introduce new legislation to amend the
act, she added.
Ms Widdecombe also told delegates to the conference that the government was
highly unlikely to introduce flexibility into the state pension age, the
option most favoured by the association.
'The cost to the state of flexibility is high,' she warned. The Department
of Social Security had been studying the experience of European states which
have equalised mens' and womens' pension ages through flexibility.
'Some rather nasty snakes in the grass have come out. If you look across
Europe, flexibility is not the flavour of the month,' she said.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Nuclear scheme that became a 16-year Whitehall nightmare:
The Pounds 2.8bn Thorp reprocessor might yet prove an enormous white
elephant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, QUENTIN PEEL and EMIKO TERAZONO

<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is expected to ask the attorney general formally in the next
few days how to avoid a judicial review on its most tortuous environmental
problem: whether to allow Sellafield's Thorp plant for nuclear reprocessing
to go ahead.
British Nuclear Fuels began construction of the Pounds 2.8bn, 500 metre-long
plant after the 1977 Windscale inquiry. All the yellow cranes and steel
walkways are fitted, the gleaming pipes are filled with nitric acid and the
plant could start with the push of a button. BNF, whose long-term future
rests on Thorp, is incredulous that the government can even consider
scrapping it.
But the decision, originally expected by civil servants to be just another
licensing application, has turned into a Whitehall nightmare. One senior
official said it was like 'the worst questions you are ever set (upon)
entering the Civil Service, which you never expect to meet again in your
life'.
If the attorney general decides no further action is needed to ensure the
government is safe from legal action by pressure groups, then Thorp's fate
will be decided in weeks on the basis of the pollution inspectorate's recent
public consultation. The inspectorate is preparing its report for Mr Michael
Howard, the environment secretary, on the 80,000 public responses.
But the attorney general may rule that the government also needs to be seen
to consider the economic and social case for the plant, given that 16 years
have passed since construction was approved. Simply preparing and publishing
the government's view of that case could delay a decision for months. A full
public inquiry could take years.
Although environmentalists believe a referral to the attorney general could
make it more likely that Thorp is cancelled, it is hard to see how any wider
examination would be equipped to come to that conclusion. Simply put, it is
probably now too complicated to scrap Thorp.
The heart of the debate is that the reasons for reprocessing are not as
clear-cut as they seemed 16 years ago. Reprocessing extracts reusable
uranium and plutonium from used or 'spent' nuclear fuel. But uranium is no
longer scarce, and many countries have abandoned development of
'fast-breeder' reactors which use plutonium as fuel. Moreover, worries about
plutonium proliferation have increased.
The UK dares not simply start the plant and wait to see if there is adequate
demand because, as soon as the first load of fuel runs through, the
structure will become radioactive. BNF puts the eventual cost of
decommissioning, including all attached equipment, at about Pounds 1.2bn.
Any government examination would focus on BNF's claim that Thorp would be
profitable just on the basis of contracts already signed for the first 10
years. BNF says that, if Thorp were abandoned, the UK would lose at least
Pounds 900m in cashflow.
There are reasons to doubt foreign customers still want Thorp to go ahead.
In Japan and Germany, which make up half the Pounds 9bn order book for the
first decade, power companies and government officials have said they are
committed to the BNF contracts.
But Germany is investigating storage of nuclear waste as a cheaper option,
while Japan began building its own reprocessing plant last month. Both
countries are also anxious about their contractual obligation to take back
the reprocessed uranium, plutonium and waste produced by Thorp from their
fuel. The German government is wary of its green movement, while the
Japanese government is sensitive to international opposition to plutonium
shipments. These pressures, thought to be the factor most likely to weaken
their commitment, would emerge once Thorp started up.
Given those uncertainties, the economic case for Thorp rests almost entirely
on the strength of the customer contracts - an extremely difficult legal
assessment. BNF says Japan and Germany would be bound by ferocious penalty
clauses obliging them to repay almost all the contracted sum if they pulled
out. That would have to be assessed by any investigation.
The government would also have to judge whether, if it initiated
cancellation of Thorp, it would be obliged to repay foreign customers some
Pounds 1.6bn in advance payments used to pay for the plant's construction.
Then there is the headache of nearly 5,000 tonnes of customers' fuel already
waiting in Sellafield's storage ponds. It is far from clear that customers
would have to take it back.
Fear of incurring penalties would make it hard for the government to raise
the wider question of whether abandoning the plant, and releasing all
parties from the contracts, could be in the mutual interest of the UK and
Thorp's foreign customers. Civil servants say that the parties are trapped
in a nuclear 'prisoners' dilemma', mirroring the famous conundrum of game
theory, where the impossibility of collaboration means that the parties may
reach a mutually undesirable outcome.
Other questions such as converting Sellafield to a permanent store for
international nuclear waste - without activating Thorp - are likely to be
hard to raise.
The International Atomic Energy Authority, the international watchdog, has
urged countries to investigate a politically stable host for such a store.
It might welcome a BNF offer to keep their waste for ever.
Some environmental campaigners say privately that, while they oppose nuclear
power, they might be able to accommodate that solution - their opposition to
reprocessing is driven by worries about plutonium proliferation.
UK officials are pessimistic about the diplomatic possibility of raising
these wider questions. Ministers are conscious of the political
embarrassment cancellation would bring: the loss of at least 1,200 Cumbrian
jobs and the creation of one of Britain's biggest white elephants.
One official said, 'We need to be seen to have jumped through every hoop.'
Only if that took years - because the government launched a full public
inquiry - would Thorp's cancellation seem likely. A very long delay would
erode the profit forecasts and could give customers a legitimate reason to
pull out. But in Whitehall corridors the working assumption is very much
that Thorp will go ahead.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Conservative press issues warnings and retributions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE-supporting newspapers today dispense warnings and retribution
for what has been called the catastrophe at Newbury and the slaughter in the
Tory shires.
In the pages of his traditional supporters Mr John Major, prime Minister,
fresh from his 'bloody nose' at the hands of the electorate, can read calls
for urgent reshuffles and the head of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor.
Some, however, are more strident than others.
The Sun says: 'Those results reflect a national disillusionment with
politics amounting almost to disgust. And the source of that dangerous
disaffection lies with one man. The chancellor. Norman Lamont.'
The Tory tabloid adds: 'The chancellor boasts that he regrets nothing and
had even has the impertinence to suggest that the ERM wasn't such a bad
thing after all.
'The man is so oily he could give lessons to Castrol.'
Over at The Daily Telegraph the words are not quite so blunt but the message
is not very different.
Fiascoes such as the coal closures, the Matrix Churchill affair, school
testing, leasehold reform and the Criminal Justice Act all added up to 'a
grisly political indictment'.
If Mr Major's administration, the Telegraph says, 'is to run its full term
and win a further general election, it will have to do a great deal better
than it has managed in the past 13 months, and somewhere find new frontbench
faces that look a great deal more convincing than some of the present
incumbents'.
The Daily Express, which calls the results 'little short of a calamity for
John Major and his government' does not call for anybody's head and says
that senior Tories are already lining up to demand that of Norman Lamont and
a much bigger reshuffle than originally planned.
The Daily Mail says the real significance of the results is not merely that
the government is disliked 'but, worse, that even traditional supporters
have little confidence in it'.
'The time has come for boldness and firm leadership,' it says
It adds, however, that the government's great fortune is that Labour and the
Liberal Democrats 'lack the determination and vigour to form an electoral
pact which really would be a formidable threat to Conservative rule'.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Losers face the Surrey disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIGHT SUNSHINE did nothing to perk up Tory spirits at Surrey County Hall in
Kingston upon Thames yesterday.
The local Conservative leadership had been prepared to lose some seats to
the Liberal Democrats, but to lose overall control after more than a century
of Tory domination was a nightmare they had not contemplated.
Mr Michael Gammon, Conservative group leader, admitted he was still trying
to come to terms with the result. 'My first reaction was one of sheer
disbelief at what was happening, and the consequences could take some time
to work through.'
Other party leaders were equally taken aback by the scale of the Tory losses
and Liberal Democrat gains. The Conservatives now have 34 seats (down from
55), Liberal Democrats 29 (10), Labour 8 (7), Residents 3 (2) and
Independent 1 (2). All parties meet early next week to plan tactics and to
start bargaining on power sharing.
Surrey is in uncharted territory. Although Mr Derek Thomas, chief executive,
had preliminary meetings with some party leaders yesterday, there is no
clear sign of how things might work out. 'Provided there is goodwill and a
wish to make it work, then we should find solutions,' he said.
The Conservatives could retain power with the help of the Residents and
Independent, but these could provide shaky support.
Mr Gammon, Mrs Dorothy Buckrell, leader of the Liberal Democrat group, and
Dr Joe Bullock, a leading Labour councillor, agreed there was likely to be a
pragmatic approach.
Mrs Buckrell said: 'We want to make it work. We haven't got control, but we
now have a lot of influence and we will use it.'
Relations between Labour and the Liberal Democrats have been too strained in
the past for anything approaching a deal to be considered, but the
traditionalist leader of the Labour group was defeated on Thursday and much
will depend on whoever is elected next week to succeed him. Neither party
intends to enter into a formal pact.
Nor do they expect sharp changes in policy, partly because the Conservatives
remain a powerful force, and partly because of stringent budgetary
restrictions. Surrey is very near its spending limit, and if more money is
to be spent on some services it will have to be cut back on others. But
there are bound to be changes in emphasis.
Dr Bullock said Labour would set priorities, including more help for nursery
education, for children at risk and for social services, and would push hard
for these.
Labour and the Liberal Democrats see common ground developing over
education, social services and environmental issues but there will
inevitably be problems. The obvious candidate for cuts is education, where
spending is substantially higher than the government targets, but none of
the parties wants to see this curtailed.
Power sharing will be a unique experience for Surrey and it will take time
for the participants to learn the rules of the game.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Tory MPs call for cabinet reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY MPs' alarm at the scale of Thursday's election losses ran deep
yesterday as appeals for unity and resolve were drowned by calls for a
cabinet reshuffle and firm leadership.
Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor, faced the threat of a renewed campaign of
vilification, presaging fresh uncertainty surrounding his position.
One minister agreed there was 'strong pressure' within the party on the
chancellor. 'He feels that he has been the lightning conductor for the
government's unpopularity,' an aide to Mr Lamont admitted.
Mr John Watts, Tory chairman of the Commons' Treasury committee, defended Mr
Lamont, saying: 'I wouldn't wish to shoot the pianist now that he's playing
the right tune. If we start to behave like the Labour party and squabble
among ourselves, public confidence is sapped.'
Some saw little alternative to pressing on with existing policies and
personalities in the belief Conservatives' luck will turn - but even here
there was a sense of stunned confusion.
Sir Terence Higgins, Conservative MP for Worthing, said: 'People had
underestimated the difficulty of governing when you don't have a Commons'
majority on the issue which is the main headline of the day - Maastricht.'
But privately Tory MPs listed a series of presentational blunders (coal, VAT
on fuel, privatisation of rural post offices) and failures to consult
properly (schools' testing).
The most vociferous criticism came from known dissenters and Maastricht
rebels. Sir George Gardiner, Tory MP for Reigate, said: 'We are in deep
trouble and until we listen to our natural supporters we won't get out of
it.'
Lord Tebbit, former party chairman, said: 'Newbury was a warning to the
government that it could lose the affection and the trust of the people of
this country unless in some way it changes course'.
But even Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee,
refused to back Mr Lamont without qualification: 'Nothing will be ruled out
in terms of getting our policies through,' he said. 'It would not be very
clever to just dismiss what has taken place as if somehow we can just
soldier on.'
A normally loyal home counties' MP was scathing: 'People are absolutely fed
up to the back teeth with what they see as incompetence, indecision and
drift in the government.
'Mr Lamont is regarded with something pretty close to contempt by rock solid
Tories and there is a great deal of personal criticism of the prime minister
himself.'
Mr Lamont yesterday shrugged off the government's electoral reverses and
responded with a robust commitment of his determination to ensure sustained
economic recovery, Paul Cheeseright writes.
Speaking to the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, he acknowledged that the
Newbury by-election and county council election results were 'extremely
disappointing and we must take them seriously'. But he sought to switch the
political and economic debate on to a longer-term basis.
'How do we ensure that Britain's scientific excellence is translated into
commercial achievement? How can we train enough young people in the
technological and business skills we need to win markets abroad?' he asked.
These are some of the questions for debate, he suggested.
He inferred a degree of inevitability about the electoral losses. It had
been a hard fight to reduce inflation. 'It's been a long struggle and it
doesn't make us very popular,' he said.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Carbon emissions may rise after 2000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Howard, environment secretary, said yesterday the UK's emissions
of carbon dioxide were likely to rise after 2000 even if the country met
international targets on combating global warming.
The UK committed itself at last year's Rio Earth Summit to bringing
emissions in 2000 back to 1990 levels, a target normally referred to as
'stabilisation'. But that commitment did not mean that emissions would not
rise again after 2000, Mr Howard said.
He told the Department of the Environment's conference on the UK's plan for
meeting the Rio targets: 'We will look in 1996 at emissions beyond 2000 in
the light of the scientific knowledge at that point - that review process is
part of the Rio convention.'
Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment spokesman, called Mr Howard a
'flat-earther' for 'disputing the scientific evidence on global warming' and
for refusing 'to give any commitment, even in principle, to reduce emissions
beyond the year 2000'.
Mr Howard told the conference that the public sector would not escape
pressures for energy efficiency.
He said the government had set itself the target of saving 15 per cent in
energy consumption - about 3 per cent a year - between 1990-91 and 1995-96.
'Our targets should take energy use by central government down to well below
80 per cent of 1990 levels by 2000,' he said.

DAVID COAKLEY, a London-based futures and options broker, was placed in
liquidation yesterday.
Mr Keith Goodman, a partner in Leonard Curtis, the chartered accountants and
insolvency experts, was appointed liquidator.
A spokeswoman for Leonard Curtis said clients were likely to get more than
90 per cent of their funds back.
The Securities and Futures Authority noted a shortfall of Pounds 249,034
from clients' funds but pointed out that private clients could claim the
balance of their funds from the Investors' Compensation Scheme.
The SFA banned David Coakley Ltd from conducting any kind of investment
business in December, apart from execution-only business for non-private
clients, business for clients whose investments were managed by commodity
trading advisers, as well as transactions necessary to close out other
client positions.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Winners shun talk of election deals

<TEXT>
LABOUR AND the Liberal Democrats distanced themselves from pacts yesterday,
but their gains in former Conservative strongholds heightened expectations
that a way will be found to avoid splitting the anti-Tory vote in the next
general election.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said that gains for Labour councillors in
counties such as Berkshire, Hertfordshire and Essex proved there were no
longer 'no-go' areas for the party.
'This shows that those who still claim that Labour cannot win the next
general election by itself are talking nonsense,' he said. 'I am not in
favour of going into pacts.'
Mr Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat president, dismissed Mr Smith's
claim as implausible, and was equally swift to reject the idea of
pre-election deals.
'We don't think electoral pacts work,' he said. 'We didn't have pacts on
Thursday night. The voters are increasingly sophisticated as to how to use
their votes'.
The Liberal Democrats were at pains to emphasise that some of their gains
were at the expense of Labour, and that there was a positive vote for their
distinctive policies.
Each party would have presentational difficulties with a formal arrangement.
For Labour, it would be seen as an admission that alone it could not defeat
the Conservatives. For the Liberal Democrats, too close an association with
Labour might alienate their 'soft Tory' support.
But there were signs that the question of co-operation will loom
increasingly large. Mr Kennedy said: 'Labour must recognise that we have a
pluralistic system and that it is absurd to go on talking about a two-party
system.'
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, is to take up the theme in a
speech next Wednesday intended to develop his emphasis on a 'new language of
politics'.
The Labour leadership will not change its language - although individual MPs
might do so - but changes being made in their own right, in particular the
loosening of the ties with the unions and work of the Plant commission on
electoral reform even for elections to Westminster, are bound make the
informal co-operation between the two parties a more likely prospect.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Ice-cream market to be probed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPETITION in the Pounds 800m-a-year ice-cream market is to be investigated
by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the Office of Fair Trading
announced yesterday.
The commission will examine the widespread practice among manufacturers of
supplying freezer cabinets free of charge to small retail outlets, on
condition that the cabinets are not used to stock competitors' products.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said he was concerned
that the practice, known as freezer exclusivity, prevented smaller companies
from entering the market. Consumers would benefit from wider choice and
keener price competition if retailers were free to stock rival products in
the same cabinet.
Sir Bryan believed freezer exclusivity had been 'a major factor' in the
success of Wall's, part of the Anglo-Dutch Unilever group, in raising its
share of 'impulse' ice-cream sales to between 60 per cent and 70 per cent.
These sales, typically made at newsagents and kiosks, are worth about Pounds
350m a year.
The inquiry is a victory for Mars, the US-owned food manufacturer, which has
repeatedly challenged Unilever's domination of the European ice-cream market
in Brussels and in national courts.
Mars, which began making ice-cream versions of its chocolate bars in 1989,
has about 10 per cent of UK impulse sales, which are the fastest-growing
part of the market.
Mars welcomed the inquiry. But Wall's said it was 'surprised and
disappointed' by the OFT's decision after a report by the commission in 1979
had cleared the practice of freezer exclusivity.
Wall's said six new competitors had entered the UK market in the past five
years. Its own growth since 1979 had been due to new products, advertising
and service to retailers, rather than to freezer exclusivity, which was a
'not unreasonable' practice.
According to the OFT, about 90,000 retail outlets have freezer cabinets, of
which 42,000 are supplied by Wall's. The earlier commission report said
competition would benefit if more retailers had their own freezers.
The legal battle over ice-cream broke out three years ago, when Unilever
obtained a court injunction in Ireland prohibiting Mars products from being
stocked in Unilever freezers. Mars appealed against the ruling but lost.
Under pressure from Mars, however, the European Commission last year
suspended arrangements which Unilever and Scholler Lebensmittel, a large
German ice-cream manufacturer, used to exclude competitors from many retail
outlets.
The EC also expressed doubts about the legality of freezer exclusivity,
which it is still investigating.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir in Cyprus: 'I had to have freedom to move, to
talk' - Polly Peck's chairman explains why he jumped bail and protests at
the 'skulduggery' around his case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Extracts from Mr Asil Nadir's statement yesterday:
'I do assure you it wasn't an easy decision to leave Great Britain, knowing
as I do the consequences of jumping bail. But the chances of me receiving a
fair trial were receding by the day. Ladies and gentlemen, nobody can live
without hope. Sadly, the authorities had during the past 2 1/2 years
demolished my hope of receiving a fair trial. I had to have freedom to move,
to think, to talk. They had killed that, and so I came here so that I could
at long last obtain for myself the basic human right to defend myself.'
Polly Peck shares were hit severely after the Serious Fraud Office's initial
raid, in September 1990, on South Audley Management, the family company. 'It
was evident that the authorities were feeding incorrect material to the
media. Quite frankly, if I was a journalist I would have used that material
too. But it was lies. The Stock Exchange and the company's brokers were
obstructive in not suspending the shares when I requested it. It is a
scandal that when I requested the DTI to conduct an inquiry, they refused
unless I paid Pounds 1m.
'The president and government of the Republic of Turkey asked Her Majesty's
Government to step in. The Foreign Office sent a curt message back to the
president at 4pm on a Saturday demanding that Pounds 100m be deposited by
10am on Monday, an impossible request.
'I travelled many thousands of miles trying to shore up confidence in Polly
Peck . . . In December 1990 I was in Turkey and Cyprus assisting the
administrators and was advised that to return to Great Britain would lead to
my arrest. I actually thought in a strange way that this would be a good
thing because I had great faith in British justice and wanted the whole
ghastly business to be cleared up.'
His returning aircraft was diverted to Heathrow. 'We were greeted . . . by
60 fully armed police complete with flak jackets and dogs. They dramatically
stormed the plane and told me, as they say in the movies, to freeze]'
After two days in custody, he was charged with theft and false accounting.
'Bail was set at a UK record of Pounds 3.5m, but I wasn't allowed to contact
any of my family or anybody who had the remotest connection with me
commercially, which amounts to approximately 175,000 persons.'
His lawyers arranged for a firm of accountants to look at the books of
Unipak, a Polly Peck subsidiary in northern Cyprus. 'All along the
investigators had insisted that there were no assets in either of these
countries. Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are now all gathered in a phantom
hotel. According to the authorities, it does not exist. I am glad to say
that Binder Hamlyn's report confirmed that monies allegedly stolen by myself
were accounted for in the books here. The SFO . . . indicated that the books
must have been cooked. My lawyers then chose forensic experts from the SFO's
own approved list to investigate this. Their report verified that the books
had not been tampered with.
'What has been most alarming has been the tactics of the SFO and other
authorities. First of all, my private and confidential mail to and from my
lawyers has been opened. It was a criminal act and confirmed in court.
The SFO seemed to be desperate 'so on to the scene comes a QC from the
director of public prosecutions. He walks into court uninvited and tells the
judge that he is under investigation for conspiring to pervert the course of
justice . . . The charade continued a few days later in a court the size of
a broom cupboard . . . This hearing involved a High Court judge continually
protesting his innocence. It was pure farce.
'On April 6 there was another knock on my door. In walked a representative
of the trustees in bankruptcy, escorted by the Metropolitan Police. They
took every single document relating to my defence . . . This action
demonstrated to me that there was absolutely no possibility of getting a
fair trial because all the skulduggery which I have described to you has
been cloaked in secrecy.
'There are many points that I have left out. I shall reveal all in due
course. I assure you that there is much more to the whole of this
persecution than meets the eye. We are now putting together certain evidence
which at a later date will be placed before you. In conclusion, I would like
to quote a leader comment in the Financial Times. The FT remarked that so
long as it takes several years to bring such cases to court, little can be
done to prevent defendants rebelling, unless - and I quote - 'society is
willing to ride roughshod over their human rights'. Thank you very much.'

FT  08 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir in Cyprus: Bail law reform moves closer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REFORM of the law on bail moved a step closer to coming into force
yesterday, when the House of Commons passed without debate a bill to tighten
up the existing arrangements.
Some MPs believe, however, that the questions raised by the flight of Mr
Asil Nadir go wider than bail provisions and include the handling of fraud
trials. The bail bill, which will now go to be considered by the House of
Lords, was brought forward before Mr Nadir fled to northern Cyprus, but his
departure has given it fresh impetus.
The measure, brought forward by Mr Michael Stephen, a Tory backbencher, and
supported by the government and by MPs of all parties, would give the
prosecution a right of appeal where magistrates grant bail against the
advice of the police.
While some MPs believe that it would have made a difference in Mr Nadir's
case if the new law had been in force - the Serious Fraud Office had
originally objected to his being given bail - others are very doubtful about
whether it would have had any impact.
Mr John Watts, the Tory chairman of the cross-party Treasury committee of
MPs, believes that the length of time fraud cases can take to come to court
is a significant factor, which should be considered.
The prospect of a two- or three-year time lag between charges being brought
and the trial beginning must make it more difficult for magistrates to
decide to keep someone remanded in custody rather than on bail.
Recommendations for expediting fraud trials could come from the work already
being undertaken by the royal commission on the criminal justice system on
the investigation, prosecution and trial procedures of fraud cases. The
commission is due to report shortly, but there would almost certainly be a
further period of consideration before the government decided how to
respond.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir in Cyprus: Getaway route was via France
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AIRCRAFT identified by Turkish Cypriot officials as having flown Mr Asil
Nadir to Cyprus took off from an airfield owned by British Aerospace on
Monday afternoon.
Mr Nadir, however, boarded that aircraft in France. It is thought he made
his way to France in a light aircraft from another airfield at Compton Abbas
in Dorset, taking advantage of new simplified EC passport procedures.
Compton Abbas airfield refused to comment on reports that a Piper PA34 had
taken off with Mr Nadir. BAe refused to disclose who owned the aircraft
which flew to Cyprus via France but confirmed it had departed from its
airfield in Hatfield, Hertfordshire.
The company said it had given the Serious Fraud Office full details of the
flight plan, but said it did not know who chartered the aircraft.
According to the US Federal Aviation Administration, the Cessna 500 Citation
which landed in northern Cyprus is owned by a US company called Flamingo
500, whose president is Mr Michael G. Hamlin. The FAA said one of the
alleged pilots - Mr Alexander Marc Tai - was licensed in the US.
BAe confirmed last night that Mr Hamlin was a regular customer of Hatfield.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir in Cyprus: Admiration and concern for a
compatriot's acts - North London's Turkish Cypriot community talks about
Asil Nadir to Gillian Tett
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY have not yet created a proverb about him. But in the smoke-filled cafes
frequented by the Turkish Cypriot community in north London the verdict
yesterday on Mr Asil Nadir was tinged with more than a touch of poetry - and
paradox.
'He is a so-so hero - we admire what he has done, but also fear it,' said
Ahmet, a waiter in a Dalston cafe which serves the large Turkish Cypriot
community in Dalston, Hackney and Islington.
The reasons for the fear among Cypriot business people are clear. An
estimated 100,000 Turkish Cypriots now live in Britain, owning scores of
small businesses, restaurants and shops.
Although yesterday most were keen to distance themselves from Mr Nadir, they
acknowledged that the media attention that has surrounded his departure
could make an already difficult business climate even harder.
'This will certainly affect the honest Cypriot businessmen,' said Mr Husein
Enver, manager of a small printing company. 'We already face a lot of
prejudice. But now people will say: 'You're from the place that that fellow
Nadir is from, the place of crooks.' And who can blame them?'
Part of the problem they face is, as Mr Enver points out, the Cypriot
community's reputation for concentrating in marginal businesses. 'We are
like the Jews were a generation ago - we're doing the textiles, rag trade
and other small businesses,' said Mr Enver. However, textile traders
insisted that their business could survive the problems of prejudice. 'This
kind of thing has happened before - and we're still here,' said the manager
of one of the largest Cypriot textile companies.
With close business ties binding together the Turkish Cypriot families -
including those of Mr Nadir and Mr Ramadan Guney, who posted Pounds 1m of
his bail - the Cypriots form a distinctive group by any immigrant standards.
'Integration is not always very good,' said Mr Munir Essel of the Dalston
Turkish Cypriot Cultural Association, who admits that many of the older
generation who came to the UK in the peak immigration years between 1958 and
1962 - a movement that brought nearly a fifth of the total Turkish and Greek
Cypriot population in Britain - still have problems com municating with
English offic-ials.
But in spite of the concerns, Mr Nadir's support among his compatriots
yesterday was undeniable. 'He is more popular now than ever before,' said
Mustafa, a retired shopkeeper, as he sat drinking Turkish coffee in a cafe.
His neighbour, Hasan, a self employed accountant added: 'We are very angry
about the lack of justice. We think he has been picked on because he is a
foreigner. So we think he was absolutely right to do what he did.'
Meanwhile, Mr Osman Kemel, owner of the cafe, said: 'He has employed a lot
of people - he is a good man. And you can't blame the Turks for what has
happened.'

FT  08 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir in Cyprus: Deadlock on extradition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH ATTEMPTS to extradite Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive Turkish Cypriot
businessman, appeared to be in deadlock yesterday after the Turkish embassy
in London indicated that it was unwilling to intervene in the issue.
Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, Foreign Office minister, met the Turkish ambassador,
Mr Candemir Onhon, and delivered a 'strong message' asking for Turkish help
in retrieving Mr Nadir.
But although Mr Onhon promised to convey the request, he refused to promise
any help with extradition. The embassy said: 'The Turkish Cypriot republic
is an independent republic which is recognised by Turkey but we cannot
intervene in their internal affairs.' He noted that Turkey and the UK had no
extradition treaty.
The Home Office, meanwhile, gave a cool response to a handwritten facsimile
message which it had received on Thursday from Mr Nadir offering to return
to Britain in exchange for unconditional travel rights. It said: 'We will be
replying to the fax in a couple of days as a matter of courtesy - that is
all'. Representatives of six government departments later met at the Serious
Fraud Office discuss co-ordination.
The SFO said yesterday the central criminal court had received a request on
behalf of Mr Ramadan Guney, the Turkish businessman who provided Pounds 1m
surety for Mr Nadir, in the week before his departure. Although the
application on April 29 would appear to indicate that Mr Guney had been
concerned about Mr Nadir's possible departure, the SFO was not informed and
the request was later withdrawn.
Mr Rick Shearman, Mr Guney's lawyer, refused to comment on reports that Mr
Guney's associates had warned the SFO of Mr Nadir's imminent departure
several times last week - and suggested that the SFO was trying to shift the
blame for the affair. 'The SFO seem to have got themselves into quite enough
trouble and are already trying to put some of the blame his way. We do not
want to get involved with any slanging match with the SFO unless they start
it, but I do not like the tone of the press release yesterday - the SFO are
suggesting that the tip-off was a decoy.'
He refused to confirm or deny whether Mr Guney himself had contacted the
police. However, he said: 'The SFO have spoken to the person who made the
tip-off and identified him. But at the moment we do not want to get into a
slanging match - we are concerned that if my client embarrasses the
authorities, who are already embarrassed anyway, he will lose some credit
when he comes before the judge.'

FT  08 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir in Cyprus: Police believe trial sabotage was
planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POSSIBILITY that a serious attempt to bribe the judge in charge of the
trial of Mr Asil Nadir was ever contemplated was again dismissed yesterday
by informed sources.
However, police investigating the original theories of a Pounds 3.5m 'slush
fund' to bribe Mr Justice Tucker believe that some attempt was planned to
sabotage the trial of the Polly Peck chairman.
The investigation began last October after police obtained a copy of a
document relating to the apparent payment of Pounds 3.5m by an acquaintance
of Mr Nadir into a bank account. That acquaintance is in northern Cyprus.
Mr Nadir was initially suspected of involvement in the apparent plan.
However, although he was re-arrested and questioned about the alleged
payment, no evidence linking him to it was ever discovered.
Doubts remain about whether the copy is of a genuine document or a forgery
designed to mislead.
Exactly what was intended - and who was behind it - remains unknown. The
Metropolitan police said yesterday that the investigation by its
International and Organised Crime Squad into the apparent payment was
continuing.
However, it is widely believed that the inquiries have effectively finished
and that charges are highly unlikely.
Police suspected the payment could have been part of an attempt to influence
the course of Mr Nadir's trial, although they dismiss any suggestion that
the apparent payment was to be used to bribe Mr Justice Tucker.
He was never subject to any illegal approach and has remained the trial
judge throughout.
It is generally believed that the copy of the document referring to the
payment was intended to destabilise Mr Nadir's trial in some way - but how,
to what purpose and to whose benefit remains uncertain.
Had such allegations surfaced once Mr Nadir's trial had started, the legal
proceedings would undoubtedly be thrown into considerable confusion.

SFO fraud investigation and prosecution. No official figures are available
but at its height, the two-year inquiry involved a large team of police and
considerable foreign travel. Comparisons with similar investigations would
suggest a figure approaching Pounds 2m
Mr Nadir's legal costs. Fees to date including defence work from Mr Anthony
Scrivener, QC and two solicitors' firms, Vizards and Pannone &amp; Partners -
which have been largely met from legal aid - are believed to have exceeded
Pounds 1m
Trustee in bankruptcy. Fees from Neil Cooper and staff at accountants Robson
Rhodes since Mr Nadir was driven into bankruptcy by a writ from Polly Peck's
administrators are believed to exceed Pounds 100,000
Polly Peck administration. Professional fees and costs from accountants
Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Touche Ross and from legal advisers were last reported
in October 1992 at Pounds 15.6m
Money out of pocket to Polly Peck creditors. Proportion of assets in the

   NEW DELHI, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA yesterday described as 'unwarranted' the Clinton administration's
action last week designating it a priority country for punitive action under
the US Special 301 legislation for retaliatory trade practices.
Mr Pranab Mukherjee, the commerce minister, told parliament yesterday that
India 'noted with regret' the US decision, which could deprive India of
import privileges extended to developing countries under the generalised
system of preferences programme. Such a move could undermine India's
economic reform programme.
The Special 301 provision of US trade law is designed to protect American
industries from product 'piracy' or theft of patents, copyrights, software,
and trade secrets, worth billions of dollars each year.
To force US trading partners to improve enforcement of intellectual property
rights, the Clinton administration last week announced tougher procedures
which would make India and Thailand liable to immediate sanctions.
In a move which won praise from the International Intellectual Property
Alliance - a group of US trade associations - Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative, refused to give several offending countries an additional
year to repair the alleged deficiencies in their intellectual property rules
and placed them on short-term review cycles to press for specific,
short-term results.
Korea, Argentina, Egypt, Poland and Turkey were made the subject of these
'out-of-cycle' reviews. Hungary and Taiwan agreed to 'immediate action
plans,' and the US will 'intensify' consultations with Australia, the EC and
Saudi Arabia.
Mr Mukherjee said that trade-related intellectual property rights were being
discussed at the Uruguay round trade negotiations.
India would continue to impress on the US that its unilateral action was
'unwarranted'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US manufacturing employment declined for the second month running in April,
suggesting continued weakness in the industrial sector, official figures
indicated yesterday.
Manufacturers shed nearly 90,000 jobs in March and April, more than
offsetting job gains in the previous four months, the Labour Department
said. Construction employment also fell last month, dashing hopes of a
rebound after severe winter weather in March.
Non-agricultural employment as a whole, however, rose a modest 119,000 to
109.3m, indicating that the economy is continuing to grow sluggishly after a
lacklustre first quarter.
The unemployment rate was unchanged at 7.0 per cent for the third month
running against a peak of 7.7 per cent last summer.
The figures fell short of Wall Street projections of an increase in non-farm
of employment of 150,000-160,000 last month, in line with the average rate
of expansion in the first quarter. The bias toward service industries was
more pronounced than expected.
Employment contracted by 79,000 in goods-producing industries and rose by
198,000 in service industries, continuing a trend established early in the
recovery.
Nearly a quarter of the net increase in employment last month was in the
amusement and leisure industries. Healthcare and temporary service jobs
accounted for most of the remaining new jobs.
Mr William Barron, a senior labour department official, said the report
pointed to a continuing 'slow improvement' in the labour market.
Total employment, however, remains about 1m short of the pre-recession peak
of 110.3m in June, 1990.
Analysts took some comfort from a further increase in the length of the
average working week, which suggests industrial production rose modestly
last month.
With factory overtime rates now at record levels, a pick-up in demand this
summer could lead to a rapid rebound of employment.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Resurgent Benazir sniffs power: Farhan Bokhari meets the
Pakistani opposition leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MS BENAZIR Bhutto, the Pakistani opposition leader, sees power once more
within view as her political comeback gains pace. Her bitter isolation has
ended with the ousting of Mr Nawaz Sharif's government after 29 months
during which many of her closest supporters were victimised.
Mr Asif Ali Zardari, her husband, was appointed a cabinet minister last
month in the country's new interim government. Under Mr Sharif's
administration he had been charged on 12 counts including corruption - in
cases backed by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the man who sacked both Mr
Sharif and Ms Bhutto before him. Mr Zardari and Mr Khan recently came face
to face at a ministerial swearing-in ceremony which only a few months ago
was impossible to imagine.
The new alignments in Pakistani politics, where foes of yesterday are
friends of today, while perhaps awkward for Ms Bhutto, is seen by some as a
period of transition leading to her return to power.
In response to criticism, she forcefully defends her decision to allow some
of her closest supporters to join the government of national unity that has
promised to hold elections on July 14.
The cabinet includes members of different political parties, with the
largest share going to Ms Bhutto's People's Democratic Alliance (PDA) and
politicians who broke away from Mr Sharif's government.
'Time and again, I have said that a political leader needs to rise above
personal sentiments to serve the nation. I have certain political
objectives, my party has certain political objectives. In the attainment of
those objectives, we are willing to sit down and talk with anybody,' Ms
Bhutto said.
But the new government is already split over the future of Pakistan's four
provincial assemblies. Ms Bhutto is demanding that the assemblies should be
dissolved because their members were elected in allegedly rigged polls in
October 1990. Both Mr Khan and Mr Balakh Sher Mazari, the interim prime
minister, are opposed to that.
Ms Bhutto also wants the elections to be conducted by the army rather than
government officials, and the appointment of an independent election
commission to ensure that the polls are free and fair. Senior officials say
these two proposals are being discussed.
Ms Bhutto's party members had threatened to withdraw from the cabinet by
today if the demand for dissolution of provincial assemblies was not met,
but this deadline has now been set aside. The power to make that decision
has been handed over to an all-party conference of prominent politicians
including Ms Bhutto. But the rift has not ended.
'We're in the midst of an election which government partners aren't sure
will be fair and I am trying to negotiate with the government to say that
Pakistan should be given a better chance. If the elections are fair, I have
no doubt that my party and I would return,' said Ms Bhutto.
The political upheavals have fuelled concern that the military may again
flex its political muscles - the country has been ruled by generals for more
than half its 46-year history. Senior army officers deny that they have any
aspirations to seek power. Ms Bhutto said: 'I don't think the army is
interested to intervene. But if this political mess continues, then I think
we'll be creating a political vacuum. History teaches us that there are no
vacuums, they are always filled.'

FT  08 MAY 93 / Clinton pledges to work for Gatt deal

<TEXT>
THE US and the EC yesterday renewed their commitment to completing
negotiations on the Uruguay Round of world trade liberalisation talks,
promising a successful conclusion by the end of the year.
President Bill Clinton said after talks with Mr Poul Rasmussen, the Danish
prime minister, and Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission,
that the US was 'prepared to take a lot of trouble to get it done.'
He added that he wanted to have tangible progress before the Tokyo summit of
the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in July.
Mr Delors said the talks concentrated on issues of market access, and set an
even more ambitious deadline: he hoped for enough agreement to warrant full
multilateral negotiations within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
in Geneva by the time ministers of the 24-nation Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development meet in Paris in early June.
Mr Delors said he was looking for concessions from the US in the areas of
customs tariffs, textiles, steel, telecommunications and services.
'This is not only in the interests of the European countries but also in the
interests of the developing countries,' he said, noting progress had already
been made 'not only in the mood but also in procedure and substance.'
Mr Clinton has shown a renewed energy in his pursuit of the Gatt
negotiations over the last week, just as some free trade advocates were
beginning to despair that he might be bowing to the strong protectionist
sentiments among some members of his own Democratic party in Congress.
Some foreign trade analysts, too, have doubted the Clinton administration's
commitment to multilateral free trade negotiations because of its
simultaneous pursuit of aggressive bilateral trade measures.
But the Clinton administration argues that the two approaches are not
incompatible: that tough enforcement of trade laws and international
agreements is not just necessary to placate domestic opinion, but actually
helpful to the pursuit of a new and more liberal Gatt.
In particular, US trade officials distinguish efforts to gain access to
markets they regard as unfairly closed to US goods and services, notably in
Japan, from efforts to close US markets to imports.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Congress election cash cap proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday proposed limits on congressional election
spending and donations from lobbyists, in a reform intended to meet popular
disgruntlement over the US campaign financing system.
The proposals are a delicate compromise between the requirements of angry
reformers keen to curb the influence of lobbyists, and Democratic
fundraisers worried about cutting their party's own throat. Mr Clinton is
hemmed in by the need to win support from moderate Republicans and the
Supreme Court's ruling that political donations are a form of free speech
protected by the constitution.
The president has fudged some changes sought by the more ardent campaign
finance reformers, but his proposals include some significant restrictions
on lobbyists, who would be banned from giving money to any legislator they
have lobbied in the past year, and on political action committees, which
channel money to candidates from companies and interest groups.
Mr Clinton's plan would cap spending on elections to the House of
Representatives at Dollars 600,000 (Pounds 389,610) with a sliding cap
between Dollars 1.25m and Dollars 5.5m, according to population, for Senate
campaigns. At least 80 House candidates exceeded these limits last year,
topped by Mr Michael Huffington, a California Republican who won his seat by
spending a record Dollars 5.4m, mostly from his personal fortune.
To entice candidates to abide by these caps, which can only be voluntary if
they are to comply with the Supreme Court ruling, they will be offered
vouchers to pay for advertising and mailings.
Mr Clinton proposes to pay for the public financing by ending the tax
deduction for corporate lobbying expenses and by asking taxpayers to earmark
part of their tax payment to campaign funds.

FT  08 MAY 93 / War-war overshadows jaw-jaw: Palestinian deaths have more
relevance than Washington talks to attempts to bring peace to the Middle
East
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BLACK limousines which daily ferry the Arab and Israeli delegations to
the State Department provide an illusion of progress in the Middle East
peace talks. But what is happening in the region is proving more important
than any developments around the negotiating table.
In the past fortnight, 17 Palestinians have been shot dead by Israeli troops
in the occupied territories and many more have been wounded. The violence
was deplored by the Palestinian negotiators, largely ignored by the
Israelis.
The Israeli cabinet this week confirmed the indefinite physical separation
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip from Israel. The 'green line', which divides
Israel from the Arab territory it captured in 1967, has begun again to take
on the appearance of a permanent border.
The implications are considerable. The majority of Israelis appear to
approve the measure which prevents more than 100,000 Palestinians in the
territories from travelling to their jobs.
It imposes some hardship on Israeli companies which depended on Palestinian
labour, but far more on Palestinian families who no longer have their
primary means of economic support.
However, since the territories are now virtually sealed off, the random
stabbings by individual Arabs within Israel has almost ceased. In the short
term this represents a partial political success for Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the
prime minister, who last year campaigned on the promise to make Israel safer
for its citizens. But it is a success which has been bought at some cost to
the peace process, as several Israeli ministers recognise.
Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, heads the Labour group within the
government which wants to offer more to the Palestinians and Syrians in
order to accelerate negotiations.
Most cabinet members have in the past also expressed an understanding about
the extent to which economic deprivation is grist to the mill of the radical
Islamic groups within the occupied territories, such as Hamas and Islamic
Jihad, which oppose the peace process.
Opinion polls within Israel suggest the hardliners are so far winning the
argument. The latest, by Gallup, showed 59 per cent opposed to territorial
concessions, confirming impressions that most Israelis prefer the status quo
to any formula which might satisfy the more pragmatic of Palestinian
aspirations.
Understandably, it is not something on which the Palestinian and Syrian
delegations in Washington wish to focus. The Palestinians, representing the
mainstream Palestine Liberation Organisation headed by Mr Yassir Arafat,
accept they have little alternative to negotiations.
That conviction may be waning. A PLO spokesman in Tunis warned yesterday
that the talks were 'on the road to an impasse'. But to admit failure in
Washington would be to hand a propaganda coup to Hamas comparable to that
provided by Mr Rabin when he deported 415 of their supporters in December.
The recent return of 30 Palestinians, deported by Israel before 1987, was
seized on as an example of the benefits of negotiation. But many more such
gestures are needed to offset the pain of the continued killings in the West
Bank and Gaza, which caused the Palestinians to suspend the work of the
human rights sub-committee set up with Israel to discuss such issues.
For Syria there have been no such gestures. It continues to say that it is
ready for a full peace, but will not provide details until Israel commits
itself to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights. Neither government
wishes to be the first to test domestic opinion by specifying anything, and
is not under great pressure to do so.
Mr Rabin's coalition government and the broad Palestinian movement are,
however, showing similar signs of the strains created by talk of peace that
is accompanied by violence.
The issue may be less pressing domestically for Mr Rabin, providing he can
patch up the differences within his party and the coalition. The
Palestinians have less scope for manoeuvre, particularly as several members
had their arms twisted to return to Washington.
The ceremonial involvement of President Bill Clinton in the days ahead would
help to focus attention on the positive world background to the Washington
talks, but events in Israel and the occupied territories threaten to have
the more decisive impact.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Old hand Demirel heads for Turkish presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY'S parliament will today vote in the first ballot for the country's
presidency, with Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel the leading candidate. But
there are signs that the vote may not go all Mr Demirel's way.
Seven times prime minister, and twice ousted by the military, the
69-year-old Turkish conservative has been a feature of the political map for
almost three decades.
There is nonetheless some disappointment that he is taking up what is a
largely ceremonial office and leaving the government without strong
leadership to face an urgent political and legislative agenda.
Mr Demirel's supporters say he deserves the post, and despite opposition
criticism, he is expected to be elected, if not on the first ballot then by
the third ballot on May 16 - when a straight majority in the 450-member
national assembly should be sufficient to secure him the seven-year term as
Turkey's head of state.
Mr Demirel has pledged to act as a 'constitutional president' although the
strong ties he is likely to retain with his True Path party (DYP) means he
will still have influence over policy. Among the business community there is
also concern that Mr Demirel's instinct will be to interfere in commercial
contracts.
Inevitably he is being accused of opportunism, a charge he himself levelled
at the late president Turgut Ozal, whose death on April 17 created the
present crisis.
Mr Ozal was accused of using the office for party political purposes. When
elected in 1989, the DYP together with its current coalition partner, the
Social Democratic Populist party (SHP), boycotted the parliamentary vote.
The difference is that Mr Ozal saw his party fortunes flagging and moved to
the presidency as a way to continue his radical reform programme. The DYP is
under no such threat.
Indeed, with Mr Demirel's departure many commentators believe the party
could disintegrate, leaving the way open for the Motherland Party (Anap),
Turkey's other right-wing party. Mr Demirel's move must raise doubts
therefore about the durability of the coalition and the social and political
reforms it promised when it came to office in November 1991.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Nigeria threatens death for sedition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S military-led government has imposed a sweeping anti-sedition law,
threatening the death penalty for spoken or published words that might
disrupt 'the general fabric' of the country.
The move follows an outspoken attack on President Ibrahim Babangida by
retired general Olusegun Obasanjo, Nigeria's influential former chief of
state.
'We have an administration in deficit - deficit budgeting, deficit
financing, deficit in honesty, honour and truth', he said in a recent
interview with a Nigerian weekly magazine, Tell.
Earlier this week, government agents in Lagos seized 70,000 of the latest
edition of Tell, which cast doubt on government plans to relinquish power.
Gen Obasanjo questioned Mr Babangida's commitment to the scheduled handover
to a civilian government next August, criticised the planned relocation of
army headquarters to the president's home town of Minna, and attacked the
handling of the economy.
Describing the transition programme as 'a charade and a caricature of
democracy', Gen Obasanjo, who led Nigeria from 1976 until handing over to a
civilian government in 1979, all but served notice on Mr Babangida that his
time in office was running out.
'We have had President Babangida manoeuvring, manipulating, playing the game
his own way. . . When you talk of a transition programme I will only believe
it when I see it. . . The only programme in town is Babangida's programme as
he conceives it.'
Nigeria's involvement in the west African peacekeeping force in Liberia,
said Gen Obasanjo, 'left it bruised, weakened and diminished.'

FT  08 MAY 93 / Ciampi wins confidence vote
</HEADLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the former governor of the Bank of Italy, last
night won a parliamentary vote of confidence in his new role as head of the
country's 52nd post-war government.
His firm commitment to carry out electoral reform before the summer muted
opposition and paved the way for a large number of abstentions. He was
backed outright by the outgoing four-party coalition plus the Referendum
Movement led by Mr Mario Segni and the Radicals.
There were 309 votes in the Chamber of Deputies for Mr Ciampi, 185
abstensions and only 60 against him - the No votes representing the
neo-fascist MSI and the hardline communists, Reconstructed Communism. The
Network (La Rete), the clean government movement, refused to attend the
debate.
The new prime minister was frequently reminded during the two-day debate of
the difficulties of a non-parliamentarian dealing with parliament and of the
fragile majority behind the government.
Mr Ciampi's non-political origins in a country where the parties have been
disgraced by scandal is a mixed blessing, as shown by the ambiguous feelings
among members of parliament. The debate revealed a clear split between
parties that want the government to last at least until next year and those
pressing for fresh elections directly after new electoral laws are approved.
The Christian Democrats and Socialists, the backbone of the majority behind
the Ciampi government, insisted there should be no time limit. They fear
facing early elections in a state of disarray. By contrast, the former
communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), the Republicans, the populist
Lombard League, the Greens, as well as the Referendum Movement, claimed the
government's sole task was to comply with the wishes of the electorate as
expressed in the April 18 referendum.
The referendum introduced a system of majority voting for two thirds of
seats in the Senate - the upper house of parliament - the remainder being
covered by proportional representation.
The latter parties openly threatened to carry out spoiling action should the
government try to prolong its life beyond the introduction of electoral
reform.
Mr Segni, leader of the Referendum Movement, claimed such legislation could
be presented to the government in days. He has already drawn up proposals
for the Chamber of Deputies similar to those endorsed in the referendum for
the Senate.
Yesterday, Mr Ciampi, in reply to the debate, assured parliament he staked
his prestige on being able to oversee such reform before the summer recess.
He also warned that the process of political realignment risked further
mutation as a result of the June 6 municipal and regional elections,
involving 11m voters.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Sealed border may turn out to be a sieve: Laura Silber casts
doubt on President Milosevic's ability to police Serbia's frontier with
Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY SNUBBING their former patron, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic,
Bosnia's Serb leaders did him a favour.
Mr Milosevic now has the blessing of the international community to either
rein in the Bosnian Serbs or let them bear responsibility for the war.
But whether Mr Milosevic will be willing or able to prevent supplies of arms
and food getting through to the recalcitrant Bosnian Serbs remains open to
doubt. Many believe the Serbian border with Bosnia will be impossible to
seal, ending up a sieve beyond his control.
The rejection by the Bosnian Serb assembly of the Vance-Owen plan, which Mr
Milosevic says he supports, appears to have exposed a deep rift between
Belgrade and Pale, the Bosnian Serb mountain stronghold. Dismissing Mr
Milosevic's attempts to persuade the self-styled parliament to accept the
plan, Bosnian Serb deputies voted to hold a referendum on the plan to divide
Bosnia into ten semi-autonomous ethnic provinces.
After their Bosnian kin had rejected the peace plan, Serbian and Yugoslav
federal authorities swiftly responded with the announcement that they were
cutting off all supplies except food and medicine to Serb-held territory in
Bosnia. It is too early to tell whether Belgrade will carry out the threat.
If successfully implemented, it could cripple the self-proclaimed Bosnian
Serb state, already devastated by a year of war.
The rump Yugoslavia, comprised of Serbia and Montenegro, has earmarked 20
per cent of its national income for Bosnian Serbs over the past year. The UN
last week imposed more sanctions on Yugoslavia when Bosnian Serbs rejected
the peace plan. Eleven months of a trade embargo have hit the federation
hard.
But the borders are porous and there is little sign that international
monitors will be deployed to the many bridges leading to Bosnia-Hercegovina.
'There are 100 border places. In many places it is like a sieve,' said a
western diplomat.
Serbian police have reportedly stepped up controls searching cars on the
many border crossings where until Sunday most people passed, just flashing
their identity cards.
'Everything except humanitarian food and medicines will have to stop going
across,' said a trade inspector from Belgrade, Danilo Hajduk-Veljkovic.
But so far the reality has been different. Yugoslav security forces at a
road block on a bridge at Mali Zvornik said they had not yet been given new
orders to apply the strict embargo announced on Thursday by Serbia against
their Bosnian kin.
Border traffic is still rumbling back and forth across the Drina river
bridges on the frontier.
Serbs from both sides of the Drina said closing the border would be a
betrayal by President Milosevic but almost all of them scoffed at the idea
that the cut-off in supplies could work.
Bragging that Bosnian Serbs did not need weapons supplied from Serbia, one
Bosnian Serb soldier said: 'You guys have got it all wrong. We've got enough
of our own guns.'
The blockade nevertheless is the strongest sign so far that Mr Milosevic may
have turned on the leaders he cultivated and modelled in his own image. By
imposing a blockade Serbia has publicly stated it is no longer willing to
make sacrifices for its ungrateful allies.
Mr Milosevic, if he is sincere about abandoning his nationalist mantle, must
now turn against his unofficial ally, Mr Vojislav Seselj, leader of the
Serbian Radical party and commander of a paramilitary unit.
Mr Seselj, whom Mr Milosevic once called his favourite politician, has
called for the expulsion of all non-Serbs from Serbia as well as
'politically suspect' Serbs. He has also been named by the US state
Department as a possible war criminal.
Another relationship Mr Milosevic will have to confront is with General
Ratko Mladic, widely credited with having swayed the parliament to reject
the Vance-Owen plan this week.
General Mladic has the reputation as 'a soldier's soldier' and
single-handedly orchestrated the Bosnian-Serb campaign.
Just before the war erupted, Mr Milosevic appointed General Mladic as army
commander of Yugoslav forces in Sarajevo.
For the first time, Mr Milosevic, who built his career on a faux-populism,
scoffed at the idea of 'letting the people decide their own future' when the
Bosnian Serbs voted to hold a referendum.
In a sign that Serbia was ready to condemn actions by the Bosnian Serbs, the
media in Belgrade yesterday gave extensive and critical coverage of the
bombing and destruction of three mosques in Banja Luka, the bastion of Serb
radicalism in northwestern Bosnia.
Attacks on Moslem relics and mosques have been tolerated or ignored in
state-controlled media since war broke out 13 months ago.
When mosques in March were blown up in the northeastern town of Bijelina,
which was mostly Serbian before the war, Television Serbia, under the
control of Mr Milosevic, did not mention the incident.
Bosnian Serb leaders so far have not shown much anger or surprise at
Belgrade's decision to impose sanctions. Hardliners said the move was
'understandable in the face of intense international pressure.
'This is very sad. But we don't need anything from them except food and some
trade. We can survive as we survived for four years against Hitler without
receiving anything from abroad,' said Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.

<TEXT>
THE international community is drawing lines in the sand if it does not put
muscle behind its decision to create 'safe areas' in six Bosnian towns,
according to diplomats and United Nations officials.
The Security Council on Thursday approved the despatch of 50 military
monitors to the six towns, which include Srebrenica, the fallen eastern
enclave.
The additional monitors would bolster a force of some 9,000 peacekeepers
currently deployed to protect humanitarian aid convoys in Bosnia.
But UN officials and diplomats worry that 50 UN officers will be inadequate
to monitor the safe areas, the last remaining Moslem strongholds in
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Mr Cedric Thornberry, deputy chief of the UN Protection Force said
yesterday: 'I would not like to hazard a guess as to how many troops would
be needed to fulfil the functions of safe areas'.
SARAJEVO: Some 360,000 people are trapped, entirely dependent on
international relief. Most of the aid reaches the city through overland
convoys from Belgrade, the Serbian capital. Renewed fighting between Moslem
and Croat forces has halted convoys from Split, the Croatian port, which has
increased the importance of the Belgrade-Sarajevo route.
The humanitarian airlift to Sarajevo airport, in operation since July, has
helped especially when clashes have blocked aid routes.
Serb forces have besieged Sarajevo for 13 months. Artillery from the
surrounding mountains has pounded the capital, damaging or reducing to
rubble centuries-old mosques and churches which bear testimony to the city's
rich cultural heritage. 'Sarajevo yesterday had a remarkably quiet day. Only
36 rounds fell on Serb-held positions and 13 on the government side,' said
Mr Thornberry.
BIHAC: The north-western town set in the Moslem heartland, has been
surrounded by Serb forces since last summer but has not been under constant
attack. An assault last week by Serb paramilitaries from neighbouring
Croatia was described by Mr Thornberry as evidence of 'two way ethnic
cleansing'.
Relief workers say the 270,000 people in Bihac, including Moslems from
surrounding villages who were expelled by Serb forces, rely on outside food
aid for survival.
TUZLA: UN relief workers say Tuzla's population of 125,000 has more than
doubled with refugees, mostly fleeing the Serb onslaught on eastern Bosnia.
Once a major industrial centre the north-eastern city is now cut off by Serb
forces, while Croat troops police the only open route to the city, blocking
it at will.
Mr Jose Maria Mendiluce of UNHCR says Tuzla authorities have performed
'miracles' in coping with the influx of refugees. City officials have taken
over the distribution of food, and even bread is rationed. About 80 per cent
of food aid is delivered through Serb lines from Belgrade.
Serb mortar rounds frequently hit what was the only city in Bosnia where
liberal, non-ethnic parties were elected in the republic's first multi-party
elections in 1990.
While Tuzla symbolises free Bosnia, relief workers worry about how much
longer Tuzla will manage to shelter streams of traumatised refugees and
defeated soldiers and still manage to retain its multi-ethnic character.
SREBRENICA: A company of 150 Canadian peacekeepers last month finally
crossed Serb lines to reach Srebrenica, set in the foothills of the Drina
River valley. Besieged for 11 months, Bosnian Serb commanders agreed to
allow UN peacekeepers into the town if the Moslems defenders were disarmed.
Srebrenica's peace-time population of 8,000 tripled with Moslems seeking
sanctuary from Serb troops burning and looting surrounding villages. The
enclave, which has shrunk to an area of about 8km by 14km, shelters an
additional 28,000 people in the immediate surroundings, according to UN
officials.
Relief workers are trying to repair the town's power lines, cut since last
May. Most of the inhabitants are afflicted with scabies and body lice.
Many have been made refugees several times over in the past year and are
anxious to leave, lacking confidence that the UN will be able to protect
them. GORAZDE: An industrial town in south-eastern Bosnia, it is believed to
shelter 60,000-80,000 people. 'The situation is very critical. There are no
food reserves. The local population is living off the land to a great
extent,' reports Ms Lyndall Sachs of UNHCR.
Water supply is adequate because the town is set on the River Drina.
Overland convoys have reached the town, but usually encounter considerable
delays at Serb checkpoints. UN officials believe the food provision was
improved by the US air drop of food and medicine pallets. Doctors, speaking
via radio amateurs, which as in most of the enclaves represent the only link
to the outside world, say there is a grave shortage of insulin.
ZEPA: Aid workers say the situation in Zepa, set deep in a narrow valley in
the mountains of eastern Bosnia, is most critical. Bosnian radio said
yesterday the village was under attack from Serb forces positioned on the
mountain tops. Just three convoys, carrying 180,000 tonnes of food and
medicines, have reached the remote village since the war erupted 13 months
ago.
Unconfirmed reports from radio amateurs yesterday said 200 Moslems were
killed in a Serb attack from Han Pijesak, their mountain stronghold.
Negotiations were underway on the deployment of UN military observers to the
village, said Bosnian radio.
Dramatic reports two months ago said the 28,000-30,000 people were barely
surviving. Food reserves had been depleted and inhabitants were eating bread
baked from wild grains.

<TEXT>
IG METALL, Germany's powerful engineering union, will step up its strike
action in eastern Germany next week by holding further ballots in three
states and by calling out more enterprises in Saxony and Mecklenburg-West
Pomerania.
Beginning on Monday, two more enterprises in Saxony will be called out on
strike, as well as 'many more' in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania.
At the same time, ballots will be held in the metal and engineering sectors
of Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia. If the vote in favour of
strike action is over 75 per cent, east Germany industry could soon be
paralysed.
Over 38,000 workers from 61 metal and engineering enterprises and nine steel
plants are now on strike.
Union officials yesterday said the strike would continue until employers
reinstated a contract signed with IG Metall in March 1991.
The contract, aimed at equalising western and eastern German wages by next
year, would have meant pay increases of over 20 per cent for the metal,
engineering and steel sectors throughout the five east German states. Wages
are now about 60 per cent of west German levels.
However, IG Metall said negotiations between employers and the union in the
Saxon capital of Dresden were expected to resume 'very soon,' adding that
these talks 'hold the key' to ending the strike.
The Dresden talks were broken off last Tuesday after the two sides failed to
reach a compromise on how long, if at all, the timetable towards income
parity could be put back.

GERMANY'S plan to privatise its loss-making railways suffered a severe
setback yesterday after the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament, tried
to water down legislation drafted earlier this year.
The Bundesrat, which represents the interests of the 16 federal states,
recommended rail infrastructure should remain state-owned to ensure that
remote regions are not disadvantaged.
It also demanded an additional DM14bn (Pounds 5.6bn) from the federal budget
before the states take over the commuter trains network. It called for the
federal oil tax to be increased and said 25 per cent of the revenue should
be distributed to the states to finance the commuter network.
In February, the government approved comprehensive railway reform to pave
the way for privatisation of the rail network after 2002.
The government plans to create, in three years, three independent companies
responsible for national passenger traffic, freight and infrastructure
maintenance. It aims to decentralise the rail network and make states
responsible for all but interstate rail links.
Bundesrat resistance threatens to bog down the privatisation process, with
the federal and state governments wrangling to find a compromise.
The Bundesrat, where the Social Democrats have a majority, is also likely to
oppose other privatisation projects of the Bonn government, including
telecommunications.
Reacting to the Bundesrat's proposals, the German Industry Federation, said
rail reform 'would be turned upside down if the state remained in charge of
the infrastructure.' It warned that an increase in the oil tax would be
'disastrous' and weaken the financial position of German enterprises.
The government's rail privatisation plan is designed to reduce the huge
drain on the federal budget caused by subsidies to the railways, which last
year had a DM14.8bn deficit and a DM70bn debt burden.
But the government has yet to agree how to finance its plan until the
railways are fully privatised in 10 years. Mr Gunther Krause, the transport
minister who resigned on Thursday, drew widespread criticism when he
proposed to tax the use of motorways.
Mr Matthias Wissam, his successor, put on a brave face on his first day in
office yesterday, stressing rail reform was a 'top priority'.
Germany and Poland yesterday signed an agreement to control the flow of
illegal asylum seekers over their border, Quentin Peel writes in Bonn.
Poland has agreed to take back up to 10,000 of such would-be immigrants to
Germany in the rest of 1993 and an unlimited number in 1994.
Germany will pay Poland DM120m to meet the cost of greater border security
and to provide transport and accommodation for deportees.
The agreement was signed in Bonn by Mr Rudolf Seiters, the German interior
minister, and Mr Andrei Milczanowski, his Polish counterpart.
It is intended to come into effect once the German parliament has passed new
asylum laws, which provide for the rapid processing and deportation of
asylum seekers coming from countries with no record of political
persecution.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Paris promises farm aid and firm stance
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government yesterday promised its farmers FFr1.5bn (Pounds 180m)
in extra national aid, but assured them that it should still firmly defend
French agricultural interests in the Gatt talks on world trade.
The aid was hailed as 'a significant first step' by Mr Luc Guyau, head of
the two largest farm unions which met Prime Minister Edouard Balladur
yesterday, but it was denounced as 'derisory tinkering' by several smaller,
more militant organisations which were not invited to yesterday's meeting.
The aid package consists chiefly of a cut in the farmland tax, bigger grants
for young farmers, and an increased premium for farmers to graze livestock
over a bigger acreage and therefore farm less intensively, which is also a
goal of the EC agricultural reform.
Spread over 1m farmers, the money is relatively insignificant, though it
comes as Mr Balladur plans to raise taxes and cut some spending in his new
budget on Monday. The prime minister's tactic is to try to appease the
farmers while he seeks to direct Gatt negotiators' attention to other,
non-agricultural sticking points in the world trade talks.
'I want to put an end to this idea of our partners that France has only one
aim, which is to prevent a trade agreement simply because of French farmers
 -this is false,' Mr Balladur said yesterday.
He will put the finishing touches at next Wednesday's cabinet meeting to a
memo to France's EC partners, detailing what Paris believes should be
Europe's aims in all 15 areas of the Gatt negotiations.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of Swedish electrical workers went on strike yesterday as a rift
between labour unions and employers over wage bargaining structures
threatened a rash of industrial action. The strike underlined the decline of
the country's consensus system of industrial relations.
The strike may provoke a lockout by employers of up to 20,000 workers if the
dispute is not resolved by tomorrow. More than 1,000 workers in the food
processing industry also began a strike on Thursday.
Union leaders said an overtime ban by 400,000 engineering workers, more than
11,000 newspaper industry workers and hundreds of caretakers and cleaners
would begin on Monday if agreements on this year's wage round were not
reached by then. Action by engineers would hit companies such as Volvo and
SKF, the big roller bearing maker, both struggling to recover from
recession-induced losses.
At the heart of the disputes is an effort by employers to dismantle the
traditional system of centralised wage agreements and shift wage bargaining
to individual companies and plants.
Already the old system of a guideline package agreed between SAF, the
national employers organisation, and the LO trade union confederation has
been abandoned.
But the unions want to preserve a system of base agreements within separate
industrial sectors, rather than devolving negotiations to individual
companies, and are demanding general in - creases for lower paid workers.

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S main political parties yesterday agreed that the country's
first all-race elections would take place within 12 months, a significant
breakthrough in constitutional talks.
The 26 parties to multi-party talks near Johannesburg agreed to set an exact
date for elections within four weeks and that the poll would be held no
later than April next year.
The decision amounts to a commitment to seek rapid agreement on a
constitution to govern South Africa in the transition to full democracy, as
well as on the basics of a final constitution.
'It's a monumental and gigantic step for millions of people looking for a
signal of success in the negotiation process,' the African National Congress
chief delegate, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, told journalists. But large differences
remain on constitutional issues, and delegates admitted it would be
difficult to resolve them in four weeks.
Still, the news will boost public confidence in the negotiations which had
become bogged down over procedural issues. Public frustration at the pace of
talks has fuelled much recent violence.
Mr Joe Slovo, chief negotiator for the South African Communist party, said
the aim was to send a signal to South Africans that 'we are on the last
mile'. He hoped it would 'put a fire under us, a deserved fire, to get the
process moving with greater urgency'.
The rightwing Conservative party and the government of the black homeland of
Ciskei objected to the election date, but did not vote against it. The
Inkatha Freedom Party supported the deal, which it had previously opposed on
the grounds that no date could be set so quickly while vital constitutional
issues remain unresolved.
Conference delegates cautioned that Inkatha's support for the agreement did
not mean the party was ready to accept the outline constitutional deal
proposed by the ANC and government. That outline, agreed early this year,
involves a multi-party government of national unity to rule until the end of
the century, with limited devolution of power to regions, rather than the
autonomy demanded by Inkatha.
But the conference made a substantial concession to Inkatha when it agreed
to consider setting up a technical committee to discuss the powers and
functions of regions. In a move aimed at pressing the conference to concede
'self-determination' for Afrikaners, 18 rightwing groups said they had
formed a united Afrikaner front, which would leave constitutional talks if
the principle of self-determination was not agreed.

crackdown on insider dealing, following a letter to the Financial Times from
a senior fund manager which called for a 'radical review' of the area.
The expressions of concern came as the Treasury began to circulate privately
the latest draft of its insider dealing legislation, which was amended in
response to City fears that the law would interfere with the way financial
markets in the UK operate.
In his letter published in yesterday's edition of the Financial Times, Mr
Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore, criticised the stock exchange for being
'superficial' in its investigations, adding: 'I'm concerned that theft is
taking place, doing a great deal of damage to confidence in our financial
institutions.'
Other fund managers yesterday backed his criticisms.
'There appears to be a lot of price volatility, some of which later appears
to have been justified,' said Mr David Rough, investment director at Legal
and General, the insurance company. Small and medium-sized companies
appeared to be particularly prone to suspicious price movements, he said.
Many fund mangers claimed that they had either been offered price-sensitive
information by brokers or company managers, or knew of others who had
received it.
'It is a subject which is cropping up with a lot of fund managers,' said one
shareholder, adding that the matter has been discussed periodically at
meetings of the investment committee of the Association of British Insurers.
'The problem is we can't rely on a self-regulatory body like the stock
exchange to police its own members,' complained another.
However, investment banks and stockbrokers generally claimed yesterday that
insider dealing had become less of a problem than in the past. 'I would have
thought that it would have been largely cleaned up 10 years ago,' said Mr
Christopher Reeves, vice chairman of Merrill Lynch International. It would
be 'absolutely extraordinary' if insider dealing was still rife in large
financial institutions, he added.
The stock exchange defended its record of investigating suspected insider
dealing, but added that investigators needed more powers, and that a central
body should be set up to take on insider dealing investigations being
handled by a number of different agencies.
However, the Treasury denied that the present investigation and prosecution
arrangements needed to be changed. It said that the nature of insider
dealing meant that it would always remain a difficult offence to prosecute.
An official said: 'The central difficulty with pursuing insider dealers is
establishing that someone actually possessed inside information. It's easy
to have the suspicion.'
The letter from Mr Myners followed a sharp fall in the share price of
Tiphook, the transport rental group, ahead of a profits warning a week ago.
The stock exchange is understood to have started monitoring all trading in
Tiphook's shares some days before the company issued its profit warning a
week last Thursday.
Tiphook approached its financial adviser, UBS, on the preceding Friday to
say it wanted to make a statement about trading and other issues, including
the sale of some trailers. The statement was not issued until Thursday,
apparently because Tiphook did not conclude the trailer sale until
Wednesday.

FT  08 MAY 93 / Pressure on Major to reshape cabinet after election defeats:
PM admits voters gave government a 'bloody nose'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, ALISON SMITH and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR was under mounting pressure last night to reshape his cabinet
after the worst set of election results for 20 years delivered a serious
jolt to his premiership.
As Conservatives digested a humiliating defeat in the Newbury by-election
and unprecedented losses in county council elections, ministerial
speculation intensified that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, would be
moved in a late July cabinet reshuffle.
But Mr Major also faced criticism from Conservative MPs of his own style,
with hints from some that his leadership could be questioned unless he moves
quickly to restore the government's authority.
With the prime minister conceding that voters had given the government a
'bloody nose', his associates said the government would have to re-examine
its political agenda for next year, broadening its appeal to an angry
electorate.
As voters punished the Conservatives for the recession, the spectacular
Liberal Democrat victory in Newbury marked the biggest by-election defeat
suffered by a Tory government since 1972.
A surge in support for Liberal Democrats and Labour in the local elections
swept Tories from control across England, leaving them with the leadership
of only one shire county. Senior ministers will be told next week to produce
a series of populist measures to add to a legislative programme for the
coming year that was to have concentrated almost entirely on law and order
and deregulation.
There were also suggestions that the government might slow the pace of
British Rail privatisation and London bus deregulation. Mr Major insisted he
would 'listen and learn' from the results but would not be panicked. His
associates made it clear that he had not yet made any decisions about
cabinet reshuffles. The prime minister told reporters: 'People were
determined to give the government a bloody nose, and that, in practice, is
what they did.'
But he added: 'Never forget the Conservative party is perhaps the most
formidable political fighting force anywhere in western Europe.'
Mr Lamont became the principal focus for Tory alarm. Last night he said the
government had received 'another clear reminder of the pain and difficulties
of the recession'. But speaking to the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, he
offered no hint that he was preparing to move aside. 'We do still have a
long way to go,' he said. 'We must work harder. But the economy is now
clearly moving in the right direction.'
By contrast, senior Tory backbenchers lined up to offer scarcely-veiled
warnings that Mr Major had to revamp his government to survive. 'I shall be
surprised if we don't have a reshuffle over the next few months,' said Sir
Marcus Fox, chairman of the Conservatives' backbench 1922 committee.
Another Tory MP added privately: 'I suspect that the prime minister has got
a year or his leadership is in question.'
Meanwhile, Labour and the Liberal Democrats vied to claim the bigger
victory. The counties will see local deals between the main political
parties on an unprecedented scale as Labour becomes the largest party in the
shires - both in terms of the 14 councils it controls and its number of
councillors.
The Liberal Democrats claimed their own record: they now have more than 800
county councillors and control three counties. Independents control one, but
the majority of county councils, a total of 28, are now under no overall
control.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, hinted that the results could act
as springboard for closer co-operation between the two opposition parties
but Mr John Smith, Labour leader, went out of his way to reject suggestions
of an electoral pact.
Analyses of the county council results suggest Labour won the equivalent of
41 per cent of the national vote, the Tories 32 per cent, and the Liberal
Democrats 24 per cent.
Mr Smith said the government had 'totally lost the confidence of the men and
women of Britain'. If reflected in a general election, the results would
mean Labour having a majority at Westminster of more than 100 seats, he
said.
He said the damning verdict went to 'the very heart of government', and
could not be resolved simply by a reshuffle.

FT  08 MAY 93 / SFO seeks 'big fish' behind Asil Nadir escape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS, GILLIAN TETT, ANDREW JACK and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DETECTIVES from the Serious Fraud Office are looking for an individual who
they believe masterminded the escape of Mr Asil Nadir, in an investigation
which could lead them to take action against others involved.
The revelations came as Mr Nadir yesterday emerged from his hideaway in
Kyrenia, northern Cyprus, saying he jumped bail and fled to the island
because he feared he would not have a fair trial in Britain.
At the same time the Foreign Office maintained its pressure on Turkey to
seek the return of Mr Nadir. Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, a foreign office
minister, met the Turkish ambassador, Mr Candemir Onhon, and delivered a
'strong message' asking for help in retrieving Mr Nadir. Mr Onhon promised
to convey the request, but he refused to promise any help with extradition.
This followed the unusual step taken on Thursday by Lord Mackay, lord
chancellor, of visiting northern Cyprus, which is unrecognised by Britain,
to put the UK case to Mr Rauf Denktash, president of the self-proclaimed
republic. Lord Mackay was in Cyprus for a conference.
In its search to find how Mr Nadir left the UK, the SFO was yesterday
pursuing 'some promising lines of inquiry'. A source close to the
investigation said: 'We want the organiser. This will show us who are the
minions. We want the big fish behind it all.'
British Aerospace said it had provided the SFO with information on the
flight plan of the chartered aircraft used by Mr Nadir on the second leg of
his journey, from France to northern Cyprus on Tuesday evening. It confirmed
the aircraft flew on Monday from Hatfield, an airport owned by the company.
British police have been working with French police through Interpol in the
attempt to unravel the full story of the escape. A senior SFO source said
police expected people found to have knowingly helped Mr Nadir jump bail to
face criminal prosecution even it required extradition from France.
Yesterday in Kyrenia, Mr Nadir was cheered as he drove up to the Jasmine
Court Hotel in a black Mercedes. Flanked by bodyguards, he delivered a
tirade against the British justice system in a 20-minute statement.
He said: 'I do assure you it wasn't an easy decision to leave Great Britain,
knowing as I do the consequences of jumping bail but the chances of me
receiving a fair trial were receding by the day . . . I had to have freedom
to move, to think, to talk. They had killed that, and so I came here so that
I could at long last obtain for myself the basic human right to defend
myself.'
Mr Nadir entered the hotel in an atmosphere reminiscent of a local wedding.
A sheep was to have been ceremonially slaughtered, but it was spared after a
British reporter argued that the killing would give tabloid newspapers a
field day.
Looking nervous and tired, Mr Nadir attacked the SFO and the Foreign Office.
He said it was 'evident' that the British authorities had fed incorrect
material to the media.

FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: Vontobel family transfers shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE VONTOBEL family of Zurich, which controls the eponymous private banking
group, is transferring a large block of its shares to a new foundation as
part of a plan to ensure an independent future for the bank.
Speculation about the future of the banking group, which was floated on the
Zurich bourse in 1986, has been rising because Mr Hans-Dieter Vontobel, the
49-year-old chairman, has no children.
Mr Vontobel said yesterday the family was open to any formula that would
maintain its independence, including strategic partnerships, wide public
shareholding or a merger with another bank of roughly similar size. The only
option he excluded was the group being taken over by a large universal bank.
Mr Hans Vontobel, the 77-year-old former chairman who holds a 71 per cent
stake, will sell a 30 per cent block to Mr Hans-Dieter Vontobel, his son,
and will give a 19 per cent stake to a new Vontobel Foundation.
A majority of the foundation's directors would come from outside the family
and it would be free to vote and dispose of its Vontobel shares as it saw
fit.
Mr Hans-Dieter Vontobel anticipated he and other family members would
gradually pass on their shares to the foundation unless or until some other
plan for the bank's control was agreed. He said there was no pressure to
find a quick solution; the bank's financial position was strong and he was
in no hurry to retire.
The Vontobel directors yesterday proposed a 25 per cent rise in the dividend
for 1992 to SFr135 per bearer share. They also proposed to split both the
registered and bearer shares on the basis of 10 for one.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Irritation at Yeltsin postponement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNEASY relationship between Japan and Russia was further strained
yesterday after President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo, scheduled
originally for last September and then for later this month, was postponed
again, Robert Thomson writes.
Japanese officials were also irritated that the announcement was conveyed
informally to news organisations in Moscow before it was delivered formally
to Tokyo.
In September Mr Yeltsin complained that Japan was placing too much stress on
an unresolved dispute over ownership of the Kurile Islands, occupied by
Soviet troops at the end of the second world war. Japanese representatives
again emphasised the islands dispute last week at a preparatory meeting for
the visit.
Tokyo assumes that Mr Yeltsin was under pressure from conservatives in
Moscow to hold his ground on the dispute and preferred not to make the trip
now.
'In some ways you can't say the visit was postponed because it was never
formally announced,' a Japanese foreign ministry official said. Mr Yeltsin
decided last month to invite himself.
Another official said the postponement was an example of the 'lack of
diplomatic etiquette' in Moscow, and a sign that the Russian government
appears to have misunderstood the two-tier Japanese policy on the islands.
At a meeting last month of foreign and finance ministers from the Group of
Seven leading industrialised nations, Japan was prepared to drop its
bilateral demand for the return of the islands. It conceded that the
multilateral forum, designed to muster assistance for Russia, was not the
place to settle a bilateral dispute.
Japan, which promised Dollars 1.82bn in aid at the meeting, insists that the
islands remain at the top of the agenda when the two countries meet, and
expects that a visit by Mr Yeltsin to Tokyo would include a concession on
their ownership.
Mr Yeltsin is still invited to attend the Tokyo G7 summit in early July, and
Japanese officials say they have received indications from the Russian
government that he may come on a bilateral visit in September or October.

MILAN magistrates yesterday arrested a director of TPL (Technologie Progetti
Lavori), a leading Italian civil engineering company 55 per cent owned by
France's Technip, on charges of falsification of accounts.
The arrest of Mr Tradico, 72, is understood to relate to contracts involving
subsidiaries of the state oil concern, Eni. Some Eni executives also face
charges of falsifying accounts.
There were two other significant developments in Italy's corruption scandals
yesterday. In Naples Mr Antonio and Mr Lucio Cirino Pomicino, brothers of Mr
Paolo Cirino Pomicio, the former finance minister and the leading Naples
Christian Democrat politician, were arrested on charges of extortion. The
allegations related to kickbacks on drainage contracts in the wake of the
1980 Irpinia earthquake - an affair already involving nearly 20 local
politicians.
Mr Paolo Cirino Pomicino also was notified that he was under investigation
for the same offence. This was the ninth such notice he has received. The
magistrates allege local businessmen either through Mr Pomicino's brothers
or others directly handed over nearly L2bn (Dollars 1.3m) between 1985 and
1992 to cover his political expenses. Mr Pomicino yesterday denied any
wrongdoing.
In a second development, Rome magistrates arrested Mr Angelo Iacorossi, one
of Italy's leading entrepreneurs in the oil and construction business, on
corruption charges. He was alleged to have paid L1.5bn to secure a contract
with a leading housing association, IACP.
Two members of the IACP were also arrested. Mr Iacorossi, who has been on
bail since being arrested in March for another corruption charge related to
power station contacts, has been recently trying to take over Roma football
club. The club is controlled by Mr Giuseppe Ciarrpico, the Rome mineral
water magnate, who is also on bail on corruption and fraud charges.

<TEXT>
A VOCIFEROUS debate over the legal validity of the Edinburgh agreement
between Denmark and the other 11 EC member states has failed to remove the
big lead which the pro-Maastricht supporters have built up ahead of the May
18 referendum on the treaty.
Two polls published yesterday indicated that the vote will be about 60 to 40
in favour of the treaty, although both polls showed a small increase in the
No vote.
According to a Gallup survey, 48 per cent are in favour, 33 per cent against
and the rest undecided, which breaks down as 59-39 per cent in favour among
those who have made up their minds. The No vote, however, is up from 28 per
cent two weeks ago.
The second poll, published in business newspaper Borsen, showed 53 per cent
for, 34 per cent against and the rest undecided, or 61 to 39 per cent in
favour after excluding the don't knows. The same poll gave the No supporters
28 per cent in March.
The validity of the Edinburgh agreement - which allows Denmark to opt out of
the Maastricht treaty's defence co-operation programme, the final phase of
monetary union, supra-national legal co-operation and union citizenship - is
under attack from British lawyers, who claim that the agreement is not
legally binding on the Community.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin yesterday promised a purge of officials who
opposed his reforms and said he wanted parliamentary elections to be held
this year, Reuter reports from Moscow.
In a televised address, Mr Yeltsin said the referendum which last month
backed his rule was the green light for reforms, which he said were being
hindered by the conservative parliament headed by chairman Mr Ruslan
Khasbulatov.
He said senior officials were also blocking reforms and said he would
instruct Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and heads of regional
administrations across the country to review the performance of their
employees.
'Those who do not share our aims should simply leave so as not to interfere
with our work,' he said.
'The heads of government and (local) administrations should carry out a
serious reconsideration of their choice of personnel - this is a direct
instruction from the president.'
He also gave warning of what will be a battle with parliament over his new
draft constitution, which would scrap the supreme legislature, the Congress
of People's Deputies, and replace it with a two-tier federal parliament.
Mr Yeltsin said he would soon put forward a bill proposing parliamentary
elections, a move which the existing legislature will undoubtedly dismiss as
illegal.
'I do not think it is worth putting off elections to the new parliament
beyond the autumn of this year,' he said.
But Mr Yeltsin did promise a crackdown on crime, and said the government
would fight soaring inflation by clamping down on credit emission.
The Russian leader, in what he called 'a difficult and bitter moment', said
he had totally lost confidence in his deputy Alexander Rutskoi, now in open
opposition.
Mr Yeltsin has already stripped the rebellious vice-president of his special
responsibilities for agriculture and fighting corruption.

FT  07 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Soap success for Brazil's Globo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are few countries in the world which have not shown a Brazilian
television soap opera or do not have one on its screens.
The popularity of these novelas has made TV Globo, the main Brazilian
channel, a leading exporter of programmes, with overseas sales of Dollars
25m last year. Globo novelas have been bought by 120 countries and are
showing in 67, says Mr Jorge Adib, head of overseas sales and marketing. Of
last year's Globo overseas sales, all but Dollars 1.5m came from novelas.
The company now has a new success with a format already sold for Dollars 3m
to 21 countries, including the US, Germany and France.
Called Voce Decide (You Decide), it consists of a 40-minute drama
interrupted at the crucial moment by a presenter asking viewers to call in
and vote for one of two possible endings, both ready for transmission. This
caused controversy in Brazil, where viewers' tendency to vote for the less
ethical end has led to talk of a collapse of the moral fabric of society.
Globo's copyright enables it to sell the idea rather than ready-made
programmes. Some countries have bought the format, but others also buy the
dramas and use their own presenters. The fee depends on audience size, so
Germany pays Dollars 12,000-15,000 per episode, Paraguay just Dollars 300.
Mr Adib is delighted: 'Soaps everyone does - but, for the first time, we are
selling a genuinely Brazilian creation.'
In 1975, when Globo began to sell abroad, 'we were very third world and
mostly just sold goals from football matches,' says Mr Adib. The big
breakthrough came in the early 1980s with its costume drama Isaura,
Slave-girl, a Brazilian variation on Gone with the Wind. This was even sold
behind the iron curtain, which then never bought from the west. The leading
actress was mobbed in the streets of Beijing.
Soon Globo became known to the world's main TV buyers and is now accepted as
a top producer. The biggest market for the four novelas it makes a year is
Portugal (Brazil's language is Portuguese), where two Globo productions on
rival channels are vying for top of the ratings.

FT  07 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Egypt to favour US wheat

EGYPT WILL continue to import more than 70 per cent of its wheat from the US
this year, despite its diminished reliance on US loans for grain imports, a
senior official said
Mr Samir al-Shakankiri, deputy head of the state supply corporation, said
Egypt would import 4m tonnes of wheat from the US this year out of a total
of 5.5m - roughly the same proportions as in 1992.
Egypt, the world's third largest wheat importer, earlier this year signed
for just Dollars 50m worth of US wheat import loans for this year, against
Dollars 150m in 1992. The country's swelling hard currency reserves, now
around Dollars 14.5bn, have enabled it to cut reliance on the loans and buy
grain on spot markets for cash.
It spends about Dollars 1bn annually on wheat, being able to produce
domestically only 40 per cent of its yearly consumption.
The cut in US loans under Washington's 'Food for Peace' programme, had led
to speculation that Egypt might reduce its call on US grain, in particular
taking advantage of European wheat.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Britain extends S Georgia waters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Parliamentary and Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is to extend from 12 to 200 miles its territorial waters around
South Georgia and the South Sandwich islands, neighbours of the Falklands in
the South Atlantic, because of concern about over-fishing, the British
Foreign Office said yesterday.
Senior officials in Argentina said last night it would protest at the move,
once formal notification had arrived from London. Argentina has long claimed
the two more distant archipelagoes, as well as the Falklands themselves.
It was Britain's expulsion of a team of Argentine workers from a whaling
station on South Georgia that triggered the Argentine invasion in 1982,
leading to the Falklands war.
Warned of the British move, Mr Fernando Petrella, Argentine deputy foreign
minister, had said earlier: 'Argentina does not agree and nor does it seem
constructive to us.'
Announcing the move in London, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, foreign office
minister, said that there was a need to reinforce conservation arrangements
in the area. Chile, Russia and Japan are among the nations fishing in these
waters.
The anxieties about fish conservation had been discussed with the Argentine
government, 'with whom we have extensive exchanges on South Atlantic
matters', and ministers looked forward to pursuing this dialogue, he said.
The Foreign Office said that the UK government did not believe the extension
of jurisdiction to be provocative. Argentina had been consulted because of
its claim (disputed by the UK) to sovereignty over the islands, not because
Argentine boats were seen as mainly responsible for over-fishing.
The foreign office also emphasised that no rules had yet been made under the
extended jurisdiction, and that the proclamation to be made today simply
gave the UK the right to make rules.

AN assassination plot against Czech president Vaclav Havel was uncovered
yesterday and five of the alleged plotters were arrested, Mr Jan Ruml, the
Czech interior minister, said last night.
Mr Ruml said police had identified seven suspects, all foreigners. The five
who were detained will be held in custody for 30 days while investigations
were carried out.
He said the police had intercepted an anonymous letter threatening Mr
Havel's assassination. Several clues in the letter led to the arrests and
the discovery of weapons.
The nationality of the would-be assassins was not disclosed, but several
commentators suggested a possible link with the Bosnian crisis. Last month
Mr Havel on a visit to Washington denounced Serb atrocities in Bosnia and
compared the West's cautious approach towards Serbia with western
appeasement of Hitler in the 1930s.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Bosnia on the Brink: UN declares 'safe areas'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE UN, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations Security Council took steps last night to give UN
protection to Sarajevo and several other Moslem towns under siege in Bosnia.
It decided unanimously to declare the Bosnian capital, together with Zepa,
Gorazde, Bihac and Tuzla, 'safe areas' which would be patrolled by UN
troops. Srebrenica already has similar protection from Canadian UN forces.
The UN resolution called for encircling Bosnian Serb forces to withdraw to a
point where they no longer threaten the Moslem enclaves.
The vote came after the UN met for urgent consultations in an atmosphere of
deepening crisis, following the Bosnian Serb assembly's refusal to endorse
the international peace plan for the war-torn republic.
Mrs Madeleine Albright, the US delegate, called the resolution a palliative
and warned the Bosnian Serbs of 'new stronger and tougher measures' if they
continued their intransigence.
The coming days would determine whether the US and the rest of the
international community decided that the use of force became inevitable, she
said.
Third world countries which sponsored the resolution made it clear the
measure would be inadequate in itself. There were again calls for what one
delegate termed 'surgical military intervention' by an international force.
Mr Diego Arria of Venezuela, who led a Security Council mission to Bosnia
last month, speaking in his role as the non-aligned members' spokesman,
called the safe areas proposal symbolic and a minimal response to
developments.
'These new elements should force the international community to act in a
much more affirmative way,' he said. The use of force was 'looming' because
the inadequacy of past UN measures had only encouraged Serbian
intransigence.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, and the US were in sharp
disagreement last night over who should control an expanded UN military
operation that might eventually be authorised by the Council.
In a working paper for members, he insisted that political and strategic
direction must come from the UN through himself. Washington is demanding
that Nato be in command.
Russia is willing to provide troops but supports Mr Boutros Ghali on the
issue of UN control.
France also wants a UN-directed force, not simply one with UN blessing.
The working paper calls for up to 70,000 troops, at least 20,000 of whom
would be Americans, for the largest ever UN military operation.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Bosnia on the Brink: UK will step up pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN WILL step up pressure on Serbia to take action to isolate the
Bosnian Serbs, Mr John Major, prime minister, told MPs yesterday, as the
government signalled its continued resistance to allowing arms to be
supplied to the Bosnian Moslems.
Stating that military options such as air strikes had not been ruled out,
Downing Street indicated that the next step in forcing the Bosnian Serbs to
accept the international peace plan on Bosnia had to be to tighten
sanctions.
No additional British troops would be sent to the region until the plan had
been accepted, although it would probably be unrealistic to wait until all
shooting had stopped, Downing Street said.
The government recognised the importance of putting peacekeepers in place
promptly once the plan was agreed. It continued to regard the Vance-Owen
plan as the best chance for a lasting peace.
Challenged during 'prime minister's questions', Mr Major called on Serbia's
President Slobodan Milosevic to 'make good' the commitment he had made when
he accepted the Athens agreement.
Mr Milosevic should do this by 'closing Serbia's borders with Bosnia,
cutting the supply of weapons and other goods, and by exerting all other
possible pressure on the Bosnian Serbs', he said.
Lord Owen was ready to meet Mr Milosevic for further discussions if it was
felt this might smooth the path to a solution.
He said Britain was committed to a 'twin track' policy of securing agreement
for the peace plan while intensifying pressure on the Serbs 'should they
remain intransigent'.
Later Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, a Foreign Office minister, sidestepped calls
from Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, and others to make a
commitment to pull out British troops if air strikes started.
Britain had 'expressed our reservations' about embarking on selective
bombing, Mr Garel-Jones said. 'Not least' among British reservations was
that such a policy would put the humanitarian operation at risk and endanger
British troops.
For Labour, Mr George Robertson, a front bench foreign spokesman, said the
government's policy in pursuit of the Vance-Owen plan had to be firm and
resolute but also measured and not precipitate in its timing. Mr Milosevic
must now 'make it clear' that the Bosnian Serbs had no alternative but to
sign the plan.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Tory humiliation in Newbury: Big gains for Liberal Democrats
in local elections as Conservative vote collapses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENSATIONAL defeat in the Newbury by-election and a collapse in the
Conservative vote in the shire counties last night dealt a humiliating blow
to the authority of Mr John Major's government.
In Newbury, the Liberal Democrats scored a spectacular victory in the
by-election called following the death of Mrs Judith Chaplin. In a seat held
by the Conservatives since 1924, Mr David Rendel, the Liberal Democrat,
overturned the government's previous 12,357 majority to win the seat by a
massive 22,055 votes.
Mr Julian Davidson, the Conservative candidate, saw his party's share of the
vote slump from 55.9 per cent to less than 30 per cent. Mr Rendel's share
jumped from 37.3 per cent to 64 per cent. As expected, Labour's vote was
squeezed to a mere 1,151 votes, losing the party its deposit.
The swing of 28.4 per cent recorded against the government compared to April
1992 was the largest seen in the succession of by-election defeats suffered
by the Conservatives since 1979.
The Newbury result cuts to 19 the government's majority in the House of
Commons at a time when its authority has already been seriously undermined
by the Conservative backbench battle over ratification of the Maastricht
treaty.
In the first serious test of public opinion since the general election, the
Conservatives were routed in their traditional heartlands, losing control of
all but one of the 16 county councils they held in England and Wales.
During a night of unremitting gloom for the government, Mr Paddy Ashdown's
Liberal Democrats emerged as the biggest gainers, winning more than 350
extra county council seats as well as the by-election. The scale of last
night's Conservative defeats will face Mr Major with renewed calls for a
large-scale cabinet reshuffle.
Mr Norman Lamont, whose claim that the economic recovery was under way
formed the centrepiece of the Conservative campaign in Newbury, will again
find a question mark over his hold on the chancellorship.
Buckinghamshire is now the only county to remain under overall Conservative
control. More than half the councils in England and Wales will be under no
overall control.
The Liberal Democrats, the biggest gainers of the night, held the Isle of
Wight, and won control of Somerset and Cornwall. The party won more than 300
seats across the country.
Kent was one of the first councils to slip from Tory control - the first
time since the inception of the county in 1889. Essex voters also deserted
the Conservatives early in the night, with the loss of 25 seats to Labour
and the Liberal Democrats.
This was swiftly followed by the loss of Conservative control in Dorset,
East Sussex, West Sussex, Suffolk, Hampshire and Surrey, where the party was
defending a 34-seat majority.
Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, described the results as a
'protest vote at a time when the memory of recession is still fresh'.
Provisional figures suggested that the Conservative share of the national
vote had slumped to 31 per cent, Labour's had increased to 41 per cent and
the Liberal Democrats' had risen to 24 per cent.
Mr Ashdown said the outcome marked an 'astonishing' and 'a devastating blow
to the Conservatives'. Calling for increased co-operation between the
opposition parties, he added: 'It's absolutely clear that the country has no
confidence in a government.'
Labour gained control of Northamptonshire, and strengthened its hold over
Lancashire. Although Labour's gains were more modest than those of the
Liberal Democrats, a spokesman said the party would for the first time hold
more county council seats than the Conservatives.
A Labour spokesman said: 'It is an appalling indictment of this government.
This is the end of the Tory shires.'

<TEXT>
SERBIA took swift action against the defiant Bosnian Serbs yesterday,
announcing a halt to all but humanitarian supplies across the border, as
President Bill Clinton warned that the Bosnian crisis could threaten the
stability of Europe.
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic moved to hamper the Bosnian Serbs'
fighting capacity after they spurned his plea to back the international
peace plan for Bosnia.
Mr Clinton described the Bosnian Serbs' decision - made in defiance of
possible air strikes by the US and its allies - as a 'grave disappointment'.
He said their assembly's decision to put the peace plan before the Bosnian
Serb people in a May 15-16 referendum was a 'delaying tactic' to consolidate
their gains in the 13-month-old civil war with Bosnian Moslems and Croats.
The assembly's refusal to endorse the peace plan was decided by an
overwhelming majority of 51 votes to 2 with 12 abstentions early yesterday
morning.
In a clear message to his European allies, Mr Clinton said he had instructed
Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, to be 'insistent' during his
current tour of European capitals that tougher and collective measures be
agreed soon.
Mr Christopher vowed to concentrate efforts to end the war exclusively on
punitive measures against the Serbs and said he was no longer pursuing a
United Nations peace plan. Speaking in Bonn after meeting German chancellor
Helmut Kohl and Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, Mr Christopher said
the failure of the Bosnian Serb parliament to back the peace plan meant that
option was now closed.
'Until today we were basically discussing two different tracks. Now, we're
focusing on a single track,' he said.
The White House later said that a new UN Security Council Resolution would
be required if further action in the form of air strikes or other military
measures were to be taken.
The Security Council held urgent consultations last night in an atmosphere
of deepening crisis. It decided unanimously to designate Sarajevo, the
Bosnian capital, and the Moslem enclaves of Zepa, Gorazde, Bihac and Tuzla,
as 'safe areas' which would be patrolled and, if necessary, defended by UN
troops.
Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian Moslem foreign minister, claimed in
Washington yesterday that 40,000 people would be 'massacred' in the besieged
town of Zepa if the international community did not intervene in Bosnia's
civil war. Bosnian Serb forces have refused to allow UN observers to visit
Zepa to investigate Bosnian government charges that a full-scale Serbian
assault had been launched.
If Serbia's decision to halt supplies to the Bosnian Serbs is effectively
carried out, it will starve the Bosnian Serb militia of the weapons and fuel
needed to pursue the fight against the republic's Moslems and Croats.
Branding the Bosnian Serb assembly's decision as irresponsible, the Serbian
government in Belgrade said: 'Aid to the Bosnian Serb republic should in
future be reduced to just food and medicines. . . . Reasons no longer exist
for further assistance in money, fuel, raw materials etc.' Diplomats in
Belgrade said the move was a sign of the Serbian government's desire to halt
the war and stave off the threat of western military intervention.
Belgrade's move came after Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Lord Owen,
the European Community mediator, urged Serbia to seal off its border with
Bosnia.

CAE INDUSTRIES, the Canadian-based commercial and military flight simulator
and training group, reported flat revenues and earnings for the year ended
March 31 because of stagnant defence and aviation markets.
Net profit was CDollars 32.2m (USDollars 25.2m), or 30 cents a share,
against CDollars 32.8m, or 31 cents, in fiscal 1992, on revenues of CDollars
1bn, compared with CDollars 1.05bn. The simulator division recorded lower
operating profit, but the order backlog at March 31 was CDollars 460m, up 17
per cent.
CAE's total order backlog at March 31 was CDollars 1.3bn, down from CDollars
1.5bn, due to lower US defence spending. However, the group said that it had
won 70 per cent of the world commercial flight simulator market during the
fiscal year.
The group's US military training unit and the German subsidiary did better,
as did the Canadian aircraft overhaul operations and the expanding
industrial products division.

LADY THATCHER yesterday accused the government of living 'in cloud cuckoo
land' in believing its retreat over Maastricht this week changed nothing -
at the same time as Mr John Major said ratification could proceed
regardless.
The former prime minister admitted to misjudging how the 1986 Single
European Act would increase the European Commission's powers. But she said:
'When you get your fingers burnt, the most silly thing to do is to bring
forward a bigger and worse act which is equivalent to putting your head in
the fire.'
Cabinet ministers are confident that Maastricht's formal ratification can go
ahead once legislation is approved - without waiting for the expected legal
challenge by Tory Euro-sceptics.
In the Commons, Mr Major said the amendment accepted reluctantly by
ministers, which removed Maastricht's social protocol, only affected UK law
 -not the treaty the government would sign. 'No change, no social chapter,
no backdoor socialism,' he said.
Lady Thatcher's intervention, denouncing the federalist ambitions of the
treaty, came as Conservative politicians were preparing for heavy losses in
yesterday's local elections and the threat of defeat in the Newbury
by-election.
She urged Europe to co-operate as individual nations, not a union.
'Yugoslavia was the creation of diplomats after World War One. They put
seven countries - different countries, different histories, different
traditions - into a mould. . . The moment the oppression went, of course it
started to fall apart. We do not want to create the Yugoslavia of the next
century.'
In a swipe at the government's handling of the Bosnian crisis, she added:
'When I was with President Bush, and Saddam Hussein occupied Kuwait, it
never occurred to me to consult the Community, I must confess.'
Lady Thatcher said European Community leaders claimed that December's
Edinburgh summit had changed the Maastricht treaty so Denmark could hold a
second referendum - but the text for the May 18 poll in that country was
identical to the first.
Meanwhile, she added, ministers said the amendment removing the social
protocol from the Maastricht bill, as approved by parliament this week, had
changed nothing - but it had changed the treaty. 'That seems to me to be
cloud cuckoo land.'
Lady Thatcher said that, unlike Maastricht, the Single European Act she
pushed through the Commons had no constitutional implications. 'But because
the Commission did not act in the bona fide way which we, being British,
would have expected them to do, we got our fingers burnt,' she said.
Her attack, which irritated rather than alarmed ministers, was combined with
a fresh appeal for a Maastricht referendum - a call also rebuffed yesterday
by Mr Major.
Results of a telephone referendum on the treaty, organised by Maastricht's
opponents, including Lady Thatcher, showed that, after excluding suspect
calls, an overwhelming majority (93.5 per cent) of the 55,000 callers was
opposed to the treaty.
A referendum amendment is expected to be tabled when the House of Lords
debates the treaty after the second Danish referendum is held later this
month.

PEERS warned the government yesterday against cuts in the budget of the BBC
World Service.
Lord Henley, for the government, said no decisions had been taken but the
Service would have to meet its share of any Foreign Office 'budgetary
restraint' after next March.
Labour's Lord Ashley said severe cuts had been proposed for the service,
many people's 'only lifeline to the truth'.

LABOUR leads the Conservatives by 17 points, according to a Gallup poll in
today's Daily Telegraph.
Its lead has narrowed slightly from a month ago. The findings, with last
month's figures in brackets, were: Labour 47 per cent (49), Conservatives 30
per cent (30.5), Lib Dems 17.5 per cent (15.5).

FT  07 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Patten ready to press on with
testing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH BLOWS to the government's plans for testing have increased the
pressure on Mr John Patten, the education secretary, but left him still
determined to press ahead.
Although the courts have not proved a way of preventing the looming boycott
by teachers, and the traditional 'divide and rule' approach to the teachers'
unions has collapsed, Mr Patten and other ministers insist in public that
they want this year's tests to proceed.
In private, however, both ministers and officials recognise that there will
be disruption, and that the only question is its scale.
One said yesterday: 'The tests will be disrupted, that is now discounted.'
Another said: 'There won't be many league tables.'
Although the changes made to testing in Scotland as a result of pressure
from teachers and parents have been urged on ministers as a way of avoiding
the likely shambles, elsewhere in government there is little enthusiasm for
what has resulted there.
Ministerial determination not to change course has been bolstered by the
reaction to the advertising of leaflets about testing - the number of
responses asking for copies of the leaflets will be released in the next
couple of weeks. A further 1.3 million copies will be issued with child
benefit.
One official said: 'It is now clear that the government is prepared to
muddle through. We are locked into our position.'
The government seems to believe the worst is behind it. The resignations of
two key advisers from the School Examinations and Assessment Council this
week are seen as a 'nuisance' rather than a more serious difficulty, and the
teachers' plans on the curriculum are seen as simply a matter for Sir Ron
Dearing's review.
Deep-rooted Tory dislike of the educational establishment has muted much
criticism of Mr Patten, although some ministerial colleagues have privately
expressed surprise that Mr Patten seems to have courted confrontation rather
than tried to avoid it.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Tory backbenchers attack ministers on Navy job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is determined to ensure that as many as possible of those
laid off in the latest round of Royal Navy redundancies are volunteers, Mr
Jonathan Aitken, defence minister, told MPs last night as ministers came
under fire over the proposed job cuts from their own backbenchers.
Mr Aitken used a Commons debate on the Navy to defend lower staffing on the
grounds that new equipment was generally less labour intensive than what it
replaced. Application rates to leave the Navy were at a 10-year low, he
added.
Under its Options for Change review the government planned to reduce the
Navy staff to 55,000 by the mid 1990s. But it was announced last month that
a further cut of 5,000 was to be effected by the end of the century.
Mr Robert Hicks, MP for Cornwall South East, criticised government ministers
for announcing these further cuts in manpower requirements 'on the eve of
the Easter recess'.
Mr Winston Churchill, the MP for Davyhulme, called for an assurance that
staffing would not fall short of that set out in the review. If it did, it
would be 'a matter of the gravest concern'.
Mr John Wilkinson (C Ruislip-Northwood) warned: 'Unless our party reverts
more clearly to its traditional attachment to the importance of national
defence, I think we will lose much of the trust that has rightfully been
ours on the part of those who care about the security of our country.'
Mr Mark Wolfson (C Sevenoaks) said Britain had returned to a world role, but
with a smaller Navy and that there was 'a serious danger of overstretch'.
Mr Aitken told MPs during the debate last night that the government expects
to announce 'within the next few weeks' whether the long-awaited contract
for Trident nuclear submarine refitting work will be awarded to Devonport or
Rosyth.
Mr Aitken used the Royal Navy debate to announce one new order, worth an
estimated Pounds 30m, for five Type 23 frigate command systems to be placed
with British Aerospace Sema.
Britain is extending its maritime jurisdiction to protect fishing stocks
within a 200-mile radius of South Georgia, in the Falklands, and the South
Sandwich Islands, the government announced last night.
Baroness Chalker, overseas development minister, said the issue had been
discussed with the Argentine government, with which Britain now had
'excellent' relations, marked by a new openness and growing mutual
confidence.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Hospitals fail to meet cash target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT programme to encourage hospitals to make money from activities
such as retail services has fallen far short of its financial targets, a
National Audit Office report shows today, Alan Pike writes.
The income generation scheme was introduced in 1988 and the government hoped
it would raise Pounds 75m a year. According to the report, however, health
authorities and hospitals generated only Pounds 25m in 1991-92.
Even so, the NAO believes income generation has 'significant potential' in
the National Health Service and says that, in principle, the Pounds 75m
target should be attained.
It believes one reason for the failure to met targets so far has been
managers giving their first priority to introducing the 1991 health service
reforms.

POLICE REPORTS of racial incidents in south-east London more than tripled in

Mr Charles Wardle, home office minister, said in reply to a written question
from Mr Peter Bottomley, the Tory MP for Eltham, that the figures - covering
the London boroughs of Southwark, Lewisham, Bromley, Greenwich and Bexley -
also show a doubling of incidents recorded between 1990 and 1992.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Dentists call for free checks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH Dental Association yesterday called for the re-introduction of
free check-ups in response to the government's review of dentists' pay.
But it would mean some people having to pay for treatment at rates agreed
between them and their dentist - which Labour said could mean higher
charges.
The association wants to see a free core service of basic care and treatment
which would include check-ups, X-rays and all emergency treatments.
Any other treatment would have to be paid for by patients, but children and
people who could not afford to pay would continue to get all treatment free.
The scheme would involve moving the bulk of adult services from the NHS.
Patients whose dentists still do NHS work pay 80 per cent towards the cost
of treatment and inspections. However, one in five dentists already now only
takes on private patients following a 7 per cent cut in fees last year.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Mortgage boost for bank lending
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING British banks made gross mortgage loans of Pounds 4.137bn in the
first quarter of 1993, a survey by the British Bankers' Association shows.
This represents an increase of more than 14 per cent on the previous quarter
and an increase of 15 per cent on the first quarter of 1992.
The increase over the fourth quarter is in distinct contrast to the normal
seasonal pattern and reflects the improving optimism in the housing market
following numerous cuts in mortgage rates.
It also reflects the banks' growing market share, with their standard
mortgage rates below 8 per cent for the first time. Offers of fixed-rate
loans have also proved popular.
The survey shows that total bank lending rose by a 'modest' Pounds 890m to
Pounds 273.4bn in the quarter to March.
Lending to manufacturers and construction company sectors, however, both
showed their eighth consecutive quarterly fall, dropping 3.8 per cent or
Pounds 768m to Pounds 19.4bn and 3.7 per cent or Pounds 336m to Pounds 8.7bn
respectively.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Local Government Elections: Tories eclipsed by Lib Dems -
Higher-than-usual turnout as voters reject recovery claims

THE Conservatives had a disastrous day yesterday. They now retain control of
only one county - Buckinghamshire.
Once 44 of the 47 councils had announced complete results, the Conservatives
bore a net loss of 452 seats, with a net gain for Labour of 86, and a big
net gain for the Liberal Democrats of 363. In Wales, Plaid Cymru gained 12,
mostly from Labour.
The Liberal Democrats were boosted by the fact that the last county council
elections - in 1989 - came as the party's fortunes reached their nadir
following the merger of the Liberals and the Social Democrats. In those
contests, the Conservatives gained 77 seats across the country, and Labour
67.
Turnout varied across the country, but was healthy by the standards of
county council elections, at around 40 per cent, according to the
Association of County Councils.
Psychologically embarrassing results for the Conservatives came from a line
of south coast counties.
They lost overall control of Kent, Hampshire, and both East and West Sussex,
where the Liberal Democrats became the largest party. They also relinquished
control of Surrey, Hertfordshire, Lincolnshire and Warwickshire.
Essex, which had entered election mythology as the centre for the
Conservatives' victory in last year's general election, inflicted 22 losses
on the party. They were still marginally the strongest party with 35,
compared with 32 for Labour and 30 for the Liberal Democrats. Mr Bill Dixon
Smith, chairman of the Association of County Councils, who represented a
seat near Colchester, was a casualty.
East Anglia, basking in prosperity in 1989, repeated the pattern for the
south-east with the Conservatives losing control of Cambridgeshire, Norfolk
and Suffolk.
The Liberal Democrats' gains were greatest in their traditional stronghold
of the south-west. They gained Cornwall, and Somerset, which had previously
been controlled by the Conservatives, with a gain of 21 seats while the
Tories lost 18. The Liberal Democrats now have 41 seats to the
Conservatives' 13.
They wrested control of Dorset from the Conservatives, with a gain of 17, to
become the largest single party with 38 seats to the Conservatives' 29.
Devon produced a spectacular swing to the Liberal Democrats, whose
representation rose from 11 to 41. The Conservatives suffered a fall from 56
to 18, while Labour advanced from 13 to 21.
In Cumbria, where the Conservatives had harboured outside hopes of taking
overall control, Labour, already the largest party, increased its tally by
one despite an embarrassing mistake when two of its existing councillors
failed to file nomination papers in time.
Labour held on to the councillors it already held, but made few gains, only
taking overall control of one new county, Northamptonshire, where it added
just five seats, with the Conservatives losing seven, and the Liberal
Democrats gaining three.
Unusual results included the former Monster Raving Loony Party candidate,
who deprived the Conservatives of a seat on Devon county council, while a
Green party councillor was elected in Oxfordshire. And one of Labour's
winning candidates in Northants was the wife of Lady Thatcher's cousin.

THE Natural Law party yesterday made its second concerted attempt to win an
election, fielding 96 candidates in the 98 contested seats on Lancashire
County Council. The campaign came completely unstuck, with every seat lost.
Instead, Labour went over the top to gain an absolute majority just after
midnight. The Tories had thought Lancashire was its best hope for a gain -
in the event Labour took 53 of the 99 seats, with four net gains against the
Conservatives' seven net losses. The Liberal Democrats gained four from the
Tories and lost one seat to Labour.
Overall the Tories emerged with 35 seats, the Liberal Democrats with 10, and
one seat remained vacant.
The only clear pattern was the rout of the Natural Law party, which made its
first attempt at power last year. Formed to fight the general election, they
failed to get off the ground. Mr Stuart Withers, chairman of the Lancashire
party, said: 'We are convinced that natural law will eventually be running
the show.'
'Who? Never heard of them (the Natural Law party),' said Mrs Margaret
Cropper, from Bickerstaffe, a teller for the Conservatives, at a polling
station in Ormskirk.
She was enjoying a friendly chat with Mrs Barbara Bourne, who was counting
voters for Labour. Both were more concerned that by 2pm yesterday polling
had been 'very slow', in spite of fair weather.
However, at Labour's Ormskirk committee rooms Mr Colin Pickthall, MP for
West Lancashire, was upbeat. Only 5 per cent of the electorate had voted by
lunchtime, but tellers had reported Labour two-to-one ahead.
In 1989 Mr Pickthall scraped home in Ormskirk by just four votes after three
recounts. It enabled him to establish his power base and win West Lancashire
for Labour by 2,077 votes at the general election. Yesterday he was
campaigning for Mr John Fillis to succeed him on the council. He only just
made it, squeezing home by 67 votes.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Local Government Elections: Horse trading set to become norm
 -Higher-than-usual turnout as voters reject recovery claims

ENGLISH local government moves into uncharted territory this morning.
Twenty-eight counties have no overall control - more than ever before. This
will have profound effects on the way individual counties run their affairs,
and on relationships between central and local government.
Formal pacts are unlikely to be the norm. Instead, the largest parties will
put forward programmes, and look for support on an issue-by-issue basis.
The two focal points for forging party alliances will be the appointment of
committee chairmen, expected soon, and the setting of the budget.
According to Mr Andrew Stunell, political officer for the Liberal Democrat
Councillors, his party will expect to be recognised as the policymakers in
the eight counties where it is now the largest party, as well as the three
where it holds overall control.
He said: 'There will be a number of Labour politicians who are having to
come to terms with what it will be like when we have got a reformed
constitution in this country. It's the norm in the rest of Europe and it's
not all that difficult when you start.'
Labour described speculation about 'Lab-Lib pacts' as 'basically
legitimate', and described them as 'the inevitable result of these
elections'.
For example, in Norfolk, where the Conservatives have lost overall control
for the first time since 1888 but remain the largest party, Labour will talk
to the Liberal Democrats on issues where they have common cause - these
include opposition to the closure of village schools, rural policies, and
applications for EC aid.
Conservatives will now be the third party on the Association of County
Councils, a body they are accustomed to dominating. The government can
expect concerted opposition from it.
County councils are responsible for implementing the national curriculum in
schools, so the news will be unwelcome for the government in its current
difficulties over testing.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (6): OECD report is gloomy - John Murray
Brown examines the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to argue the case for fiscal and monetary discipline when the
economy is growing at close to 6 per cent, and foreign exchange reserves are
at the highest levels ever recorded during the republic's 70-year history.
No one is predicting a crisis just yet. But the Paris-based Organisation of
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), in an unusually gloomy report
on Turkey's economy, warns that 'no slippage should be tolerated' in
restoring control over public finances.
The external side looks robust, at least for the moment. But, as ever, the
resilience of the Turkish private sector is undermined by the miserable
state of public finances.
Turkey has little problem servicing its Dollars 54.7bn foreign debt. Exports
continue to grow, having reached Dollars 14.7bn in 1992, while foreign
reserves at close to Dollars 17bn in April will cover eight months of
imports. What with tourism revenues, set to reach Dollars 4bn, and
continuing remittances from its overseas workers, Turkey should have little
trouble financing its balance of payments.
However, the OECD says the picture is not 'as benign as it appears'.
Turkey's economy, in recession in 1991, rebounded in 1992. But given such a
strong recovery, the government made only limited progress in reducing the
public sector borrowing requirement. The PSBR was cut from 14.4 per cent, to
around 13 per cent of GNP, in 1992. This is using a figure for the cash
deficit on the budget of TL56,000bn, not the TL43,000bn as claimed by the
government  - the amount appropriated by parliament rather than that
actually spent during the year. Again, in the words of the OECD, 'it is
difficult to call this an achievement'.
More worrying is that some of the key external indicators are showing signs
of weathering. The debt service ratio  - which measures interest and
principal repayments as a proportion of Turkey's exports of goods and
services  - is close to 30 per cent.
Turkey's debt stock increased by an estimated Dollars 4bn in 1992. Much of
the increase was from the bond markets. In the wake of receiving a BBB
rating from the Standard &amp; Poor's credit agency, Turkey has gone to Japanese
and US bond markets for the first time. However, even here there are
questions whether this is the best way to fund development.
With an increasing volume of Turkey's debt carrying variable interest rates,
the treasury is looking for ways to protect itself against adverse currency
movements. It is estimated that cross rates added close to Dollars 2bn to
Turkey's debt in 1992.
The rate of growth of domestic debt is even more pronounced. According to
economists, domestic debt stock has increased at an annual average rate of
17.8 per cent over the period 1987-92. Over the same period, Turkey's gross
national product has improved by only 4 per cent a year.
As ever, it is not the absolute size of the public deficit which is at
stake. In many respects, Turkey needs to spend more on health and education,
to bring it in line with its European competitors. There is still no social
safety net, which will be needed if the government is ever to address the
need to close some of the 235 state enterprises which continue to be a
burden on the public purse.
While the treasury remains wary of resorting to increased foreign borrowing,
it has come to depend increasingly on the domestic capital markets to
finance its deficit, crowding out the private sector's need for investment
funds and driving up interest rates. What the treasury cannot finance
through the capital markets is made up by short-term advances from the
central bank, in effect printing money and fuelling inflation.
The result is a vicious circle. Inflation fuels higher public-sector wage
settlements, increases the government's debt servicing, and undermines the
efforts at tax consolidation.
The impact on the private sector is equally dramatic. Inflation chokes off
private investment, pushes up wage costs and acts as a drag on the equity
markets, where new issues have all but dried up. The government's appetite
for funds has deprived the Istanbul stock exchange of badly needed
liquidity, which analysts believe is one of the major constraints on the
market's growth.
Clearly, new investment is vital if Turkey is to be able to upgrade its
industrial base and retain domestic market share against the competition
from imports. The issue will become all the more acute as Turkey lowers its
tariffs further in the countdown to customs union with the European
Community in 1995.
The issue is equally pressing on the export side, where Turkey is
over-dependent on a textile industry which is badly in need of some
retooling. According to EC officials in Ankara, Turkey relies on the EC for
75 per cent of its textile exports. Textiles remain Turkey's single largest
export item, making up 54 per cent of total export receipts.
Inflation fuels wage demands, too. Wages are now the largest cost to Turkish
industry. Unionised labour has restored the ground lost during the
mid-1980s, when a coincidence of low wages and a depreciating currency
helped to launch Turkey's export drive. The share of wages and salaries in
GNP grew from 7.5 per cent in 1987 to 13 per cent last year, according to
economist Ali Tigrel, of Marmara bank. As a result, many businesses are now
relying on contract labour.
Despite some improvement in 1992, the OECD says underlying inflation is
still on the rise. The problem is compounded by policy drift and a serious
breakdown in co-ordination between the economic ministries and the central
bank and key arms of the bureaucracy.
Relations between Mrs Tansu Ciller, the chief economics minister, and
central bank governor Rusdu Saracoglu have reached a new low. At one point
Mr Saracoglu seemed close to resigning, when he hurriedly returned from a
skiing holiday in France to stop Mrs Ciller from introducing changes in bank
reserve requirements, the amount of a bank's deposits which must be lodged
with the central bank.
To the outsider, the issue may seem a little abstruse. But given the lack of
other monetary instruments, control over bank credit is about the only tool
left for the governor.
After missing the targets by such a wide margin last year, the central bank
decided against issuing monetary projections for 1993. Instead, the Bank is
concentrating its efforts on interest rates to dampen exchange rate
volatility, the final defence against rampant domestic inflation. To do
this, the Bank has had to resort to increased interventions to uphold the
lira's value in the market, one reason for the high official reserve policy.
Mrs Ciller still believes the lira is too high. 'We are not going to make
any huge devaluation, no one should expect that. But we need to keep up with
inflation. . . If you try to withdraw money from the market because you feel
there's a pressure on foreign exchange, that puts an artificial pressure on
interests rates,' she says, in an oblique criticism of the governor's
exchange-rate policy.
In the long run, without some form of external anchor, it is difficult to
see how the government can hope to curb inflation, now running at around 60
per cent. The short-term answer has been to resort to measures like the tax
amnesty and the consolidation of the debts of the public-sector enterprises.
Some progress has also been made with privatisation, with asset sales
realising some Dollars 570m in 1992, compared with Dollars 1.3bn in the
period 1986-1991, under the old Motherland party government. Mrs Ciller
talks about selling off the PTT, the state telephone monopoly. Closing down
loss-making concerns would have an immediate impact. But as prime minister
Suleyman Demirel concedes, 'our public is not ready for that yet'.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (2): A new generation may now get its
chance - Politics, at a time of great uncertainty, John Murray Brown
considers what may happen next
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Turgut Ozal's sudden death from heart failure on April 17 was a
severe blow, setting off an unpredictable chain of events.
If the loss of Mr Ozal is followed by a decision by prime minister Suleyman
Demirel to stand as a candidate for the presidency, this would remove the
two principal actors from the Turkish political stage.
One possibility is that the present turmoil will eventually encourage the
two right-wing parties to join forces. It may also result in a reunification
of the left. This in turn could force through a new generation of younger
Turkish politicians. These, at least, are the hopes of many Turks.
It would be hard to imagine the True Path (DYP) party without Mr Demirel, if
he gives up the leadership to become president. Yet much the same was said
of the late Mr Ozal when he had himself appointed to the presidency in 1989.
In the event, after a bitter internal struggle, the Motherland Party (Anap)
emerges today with a good chance of winning the next election under Mr Mesut
Yilmaz, a leader of experience and a former prime minister.
Few of the parliament's 450 deputies appear anxious to settle the issue with
early elections. Without Mr Demirel at the helm to steer the party through
the next election, many DYP parliamentarians would expect to lose their
seats and, more important, lose the lever of patronage that goes with it.
The question of who would succeed Mr Demirel as DYP head has first to be
settled. Various names have been put forward, including that of interior
minister Ismet Sezgin, a respectable if uninspiring figure. Mrs Tansu
Ciller, the feisty economy minister, has made no secret of her leadership
ambitions, although conservative elements in DYP may block her.
Parliamentary speaker Husamettin Cindoruk would be a more popular choice,
although his maverick stance on issues in defiance of the DYP has alienated
some party support.
The search for a new leader could well lead to the collapse of the 17-month
old coalition with the Social Democratic Populists (SHP), and the
painstaking formation of a new government.
to secure their democratic traditions. If the history of coalitions is a
fairly unhappy one, it nonetheless underscores the unstable nature of
Turkish political loyalties. Since 1960, the country has seen three military
coups. Successive interventions have left the political landscape riven with
fault lines.
But today, particularly among young people, there is a growing disillusion
with the old-style patronage politics. Like peers in the House of Lords,
Turkish deputies have come under public fire, the latest target being the
parliament's appalling record of absenteeism.
Apart from the extreme parties, particularly the Islamic right, divisions in
Turkish politics remain artificial. The spectrum ranges from fundamentalist
Islam to nationalists of both left and right. In between these are two
centre-right parties, two social democrat parties, and a radical Kurdish
group, the People's Labour party (HEP).
The recent proliferation  - there are now 10 parties with representation in
parliament  - is not so much a measure of Turkish pluralism, as the result
of Mr Demirel's decision to lift the ban on parties outlawed by the generals
in 1980.
On the right, it is often hard to distinguish between the DYP and Anap,
currently the main opposition party. The former is the inheritor of the
Justice party, banned after the 1980 coup. The Justice party, without being
able to say so too explicitly, was the natural successor to the right-wing
populists of the Democrat party of Adnan Menderes, the Turkish prime
minister executed in 1961.
Anap is more closely identified with the urban middle class. It attracts the
business vote of Istanbul, while the DYP has been strong in the smaller
towns of Anatolia and the Aegean.
Both parties are broadly committed to the market-based economic policies
pursued by Mr Ozal from the early 1980s, although the DYP has shown more
instinct for Keynesian style interventionism than Anap. As long as the
right-wing parties control a future government, Turkey will continue to
pursue a pro-western foreign policy.
The right-wing vote in Turkey has traditionally accounted for about 60 per
cent of the electorate, and many analysts believe there will be an
overwhelming logic for the parties to bury their differences.
But for all the similarities, a DYP-Anap coalition will not be easy to forge
in the wake of recent corruption allegations. For the first time since the
military coup, two former Anap ministers were put on trial earlier this
year, charged with irregularities on government procurement contracts.
Anap's response has been to mount a vitriolic campaign of slander against
state minister Cavit Caglar.
In a recent poll, Mr Caglar emerged as the least popular of the main Turkish
politicians. He remains a close confidant of Mr Demirel, and Anap's campaign
has clearly hurt Mr Demirel's public standing.
On the left, the picture is equally unresolved. Mr Erdal Inonu's SHP has of
late looked distinctly uncomfortable, as the junior coalition partners of
the DYP, on sensitive issues like policy towards the Kurdish minority, on
the new education bill which reflects the growing influence of the Islamic
lobby in the ministry, and on the recent ban on private radios  - an issue
on which the coalition has lost considerable public sympathy.
Also on the left, the Republican People's party (CHP) has emerged as the
main beneficiary of the lifting of the ban on political parties, although
predictions that large numbers of SHP deputies would defect to the CHP
proved exaggerated.
The CHP currently has 21 seats, compared with 54 for the SHP. The main loser
has been Mr Bulent Ecevit, the former prime minister, whose Democratic
Socialists (DSP) has now been reduced to just three seats.
Where the DSP has fallen down, the Moslem-based Welfare party (RP) has made
ground. The party, which has 40 seats, stands on an anti-western Islamic
platform, and has done well in recent by-elections among the disaffected
populations of the poorer urban constituencies, particularly in Istanbul.
The one unknown in all this is what role Kurdish politics is to play in
Turkey. The constitution currently bans politicians from appealing to
explicitly ethnic sentiment. But if the various Kurdish political groups are
able to forge a common stance in the wake of the rebel ceasefire, there
could soon be a new force to contend with, creating quite new fissures in
Turkish politics.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (15): Protectionism falls - Towards customs
union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID TONGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been a rude awakening. This spring, Turkish industry has suddenly
realised that customs union with the European Community is no longer a
political catch-phrase but an impending commercial reality. How are Turkish
corporations handling this?
When the 1993 import regime was being prepared, their traditional strategy -
visiting their friends in the under-secretariat of treasury and foreign
trade, and pleading their case for 50-100 per cent customs barriers - proved
inadequate.
True, a few industries, such as household electronics, were able to gain a
temporary respite. But the average level of protectionism against EC
industrial goods fell by over one quarter, from 21.6 per cent to 15.2 per
cent, according to initial Community calculations. Industry now accepts that
this was not a one-off blow, but part of an irreversible drift to full
customs union. This is due in 1995, according to the Turks' interpretation
of current treaties, and in 1996, according to Brussels.
The response of Turkey's largest commercial group, Koc c has been to make a
zero tariff regime a central assumption of its strategy, Koc 2000. The group
has six main divisions: automotive (it produces 55 per cent of Turkey's
cars), durable goods, consumer products, construction and mining, energy,
and trade and tourism.
Customs union could particularly hit its dominance of Turkey's white and
brown goods market, each of which racked up turnover of around Dollars 2.5bn
in 1992. It accounts for 52 per cent of the refrigerators produced in Turkey
and 33 per cent of its television sets.
If any company should have been able to plead its case while this year's
tariff regime was being prepared, it was Koc. Overall group turnover of
Dollars 11.3bn in 1992 was equivalent to a healthy 7.5 per cent of Turkey's
GDP, and the then under-secretary of the treasury was its former financial
co-ordinator.
Indeed, where cars and brown goods were concerned, some respite was gained.
But in the case of washing machines, the degree of protectionism fell from
33.5 per cent to 16.1 per cent. Koc says that its consumer durable division
is working on the assumption that worse is to come.
The group's white-goods company, Arcelik, is Europe's fifth largest producer
of refrigerators and earns good margins - 10 per cent before tax on sales,
compared with international levels of nearer 2 per cent.
Executives responsible for these activities say that, when Turkey's white
goods producers visited Ankara last November, they did not ask for higher
tariffs. They see themselves as a sector which can stand on its own feet,
and believe that Turkey's negotiators may make concessions to Brussels on
white goods in order to gain ground on more fragile industries. What they
are against are the costly surprises to which they, and other companies in
Turkey, have often been exposed in the past. 'We asked for a schedule, not
protection,' one executive says.
Koc also asked that Turkish officials negotiate on non-tariff barriers. It
complains of packaging requirements that are only applied to imported
appliances and what it sees as suspiciously protracted national testing
processes. If these arguments, which Turkish negotiators may be raising in
the future, what is Arcelik doing today? Its strategy is fourfold:
Developing licences with leading European companies to ensure their
technology stays state of the art. Examples include its agreements with
Bosch.
Strengthening their production base by increasing investment from 5 per cent
of turnover to 9 per cent.
Building their presence in the European market. Koc has gained a foothold in
the UK under its European brand name, Beko, and this year will begin to
market in France, with Spain to follow.
Seeking an alliance with a major European white goods player. In return for
state-of-the-art technology and a chance to use the partner's distribution
channels, Koc is offering a share of its 60 per cent hold on the Turkish
market, as well as access to low-cost engineering talent and skilled labour.
In short, Koc is both flowing with the tide toward customs union and making
sure Turkey's negotiators are well prepared.
Their strategy is of more recent date than that adopted a decade ago by
Eczacibasi Holding, owner of Turkey's leading pharmaceutical company and of
an industrial group with turnover in 1992 of Dollars 1.5bn. In the
mid-1980s, the group decided that it would concentrate on the businesses it
knew, and that it could no longer rely on protected markets.
As Mr Toker Alban, deputy general manager at the Holding explains: 'We saw
there were areas where we were strong in Turkey but weak internationally. In
these, we believed that without a strong partner we could not survive.'
Resulting from this are the various 50:50 joint ventures it has developed
with Ja/Mont (itself a joint venture of James Rivers of the US, Feruzzi of
Italy and Nokia of Finland) for tissue paper; with Procter &amp; Gamble for
disposable diapers and sanitary napkins; with Marazzi of Italy for ceramic
tiles; and with American Standard for perspex bathtubs. It also obtained its
drug partners' help in making sure that it incorporated the latest
technology in its new pharmaceutical plant, a Dollars 100m investment which
opened last autumn.
Eczacibasi has also put its emphasis on marketing, not just in Turkey but
abroad. Last year, it set up a drug wholesaling operation in Russia and its
first pharmacy in Moscow - 80 years after its first one in Izmir - with
plans to franchise its name through the Commonwealth of Independent States.
The Holding now produces 15.5 per cent of Turkey's pharmaceuticals (and
accounts for half of the country's total drug exports), 80 per cent of
serums, 70 per cent of toothpaste, 60 per cent of tissue papers, 80 per cent
of sanitary napkins and over 40 per cent of its ceramics.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (16): Inflation complicates the figures -
The structure of the banking sector still looks a little fragile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN

<TEXT>
ON FIRST impressions, Turkish banks would seem to be making handsome
profits. But first impressions can be misleading. For even here, in one of
the more robust sectors of the economy, inflation and the lamentable state
of public finances are starting to make their mark.
It is difficult, without inflation accounting standards, to be confident
about the figures. Reported profits certainly have increased, even adjusting
for the depreciation of the lira. However, as far as the balance sheets are
concerned, many bankers acknowledge there has been a steady deterioration in
some of the key financial ratios.
High real interest rates mean that many institutions remain extremely
liquid, as managers struggle to place the mushrooming level of savings
deposits. Moreover, foreign exchange accounted for half of all deposits at
the end of 1992 - a trend which has left many banks exposed to increased
currency risk.
To the consternation of the banking authorities, the phenomenon of 'currency
substitution' is taking a grip on the sector. Emlak, a state-owned housing
bank now offers index-linked housing loans. Meanwhile, the consumer boom has
been fuelled largely by short-term foreign borrowing by commercial and state
banks.
The regulatory authorities have not favoured the banks. Turkish managers
complain that they face legal reserve requirements much higher than the
European average - a measure of the central bank's concern to control credit
liquidity. While the central bank continues to maintain these levels, bank
intermediation costs - the spread between lending and borrowing - will
remain high.
The problem of the lack of a developed spot and forward foreign exchange
market, meanwhile, continues to bedevil overseas investors trying to hedge
the lira.
Just to rub salt in the wounds, the banks suffered from the loss of key tax
concessions in 1992, with a minimum effective corporation tax established at
23 per cent. Hitherto, because of the tax incentives offered to holders of
treasury bills and other incentives, few banks incurred the standard 46 per
cent corporation tax. Indeed, many banks were able to offset all their
liabilities, incurring only the 10 per cent withholding tax.
The latest legislation is aimed at diverting funds to the stock exchange.
However, for the more conservative institutions, like the privately owned
Akbank, the tax move was a major blow. In 1992, Akbank suffered its first
fall in profits since it went public in 1989, in large part as a result of a
hefty 140 per cent increase in its tax charge.
For all the changes of recent years, the structure of Turkish banking still
looks a little fragile. The landscape is dominated by the state-owned banks.
As for the private sector banks, most are owned by, and largely dependent
on, the performance of parent holding companies. Ak, for example, is
controlled by the Sabanc family.
The World Bank has had some success in helping to restructure the balance
sheets of some of the state banks, although the problems at Ziraat Bank, the
state-owned agricultural credit bank, has meant the last tranche of a
financial sector reform loan was held back - and has now been cancelled
altogether.
The issue, as with all of the state sector, is to introduce financial
disciplines to meet the market. Ziraat is perhaps an extreme case. The bank,
after all, acts more like an arm of the Treasury, collecting road and bridge
tolls in rural areas, and making payments to civil servants. The bank
calculates it makes around 63m transactions every year.
Ziraat's reported profit was more than five times that of the next most
profitable bank. 'Our branch next door makes more than a medium size bank,'
claims Mr Caner Oner, executive vice-president. However, the vast proportion
of its loan book - he estimates around 85 per cent - is to the agricultural
sector, where levels of default are notoriously high. Moreover the bank does
not make provision against lines extended to state-owned crop co-operatives,
where there is often little realistic chance of recovery. The bank is
accruing interest, thus inflating its income while deflating costs. One
economist, familiar with the bank, said that if real provisions were made it
would probably wipe out the net worth of the bank.
For all its problems, Ziraat has been leading the way in the development of
personal finance, where Turks have taken quickly to the advent of plastic
credit cards and automatic teller machines.
To keep up with the demands created by the market-based economic reforms,
set in motion by the former Ozal administration in the early 1980s, many
banks are now investing in the infrastructure of automation.
'The basic reason we invested so much in computerisation was to keep the
customers out of the bank,' says Mr Oner. Ziraat, with some 10m retail
customers, now has 16 different types of card. The bank has the largest ATM
network, and is introducing phone banking.
Isbank, Turkey's largest commercial bank, has gone one step further.
Customers can now make share transactions through an ATM, even on a Sunday
when the Istanbul Stock Exchange is not trading.
Consumer lending, too, is a growing activity. However, recent bank
performance has been driven by Treasury bill activity, which offers an
attractive risk-free high yield investment. The banks, in effect, are
feeding on the inability of the government to contain its hunger for funds.
'In today's market, if you go to a triple-A customer, they are not ready to
pay more than 65 per cent,' says Mr Unal Korukcu, Isbank general manager.
The high cost of funding has hit foreign banks, too. One French banker said
European institutions that set up retail operations in earlier years were
now reassessing their strategies, as big blue-chip Turkish companies turned
to local banks to organise their offshore credit needs.
Given all the difficulties, many observers believe Turkish banks are still
some way from reaching the capital adequacy ratios set by the Bank of
International Settlements. The broader exercise of harmonisation of Turkish
banking with those of the European Community has even further to go.
In line with BIS requirements, many banks have started a programme of
disposals of their equity participations. Isbank, which at one stage saw
itself as a leader of industry, has sold its interests in Unilever, the
Anglo Dutch conglomerate, one of more than 100 equity participations. The
bank has also sold cement factories, and interests in Tofas, the Fiat
assembly operation.
For all that, Mr Unal Korukcu, the Isbank general manager, says the
portfolio has actually increased as a result of capital expansions. In
addition, in some cases of non-performing loans, the bank has been forced to
take new equity positions under debt-for-equity arrangements. Now the highly
liquid state of the bank is also impairing the effort to reach the capital
ratios.
'We now have to be very careful we do not let our deposits rise too high,'
says Mr Korukcu.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (13): A tale of two funerals - Reviving
Islam challenges Ataturk's legacy of secularism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UGUR MUMCU (pronounced 'Oo-oor Moomjoo') was Turkey's best known
investigative journalist, delving into the murky waters of terrorism,
drug-running, intelligence services and the connections between them. He
became known internationally for his work on 'the Bulgarian connection'
behind the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II by a young
right-wing Turkish fanatic.
But in Turkey he was known also as an outspoken political columnist in the
main left-wing newspaper Cumhuriyet ('Republic'), an upholder of democratic
socialism and personal and political freedom, and an untiring scourge of
corruption, oppression, intimidation and censorship, whether exercised by
the state or by militant Islamic agitators.
Such a man makes many friends, and quite a few dangerous enemies. But when
Mumcu was killed by a car-bomb on January 24 most people assumed he was the
latest victim of Islamic fundamentalism. (Other similar murders have been
linked to groups trained in Iran, though in this one the police have yet to
make an arrest, or even name a suspect.) Overnight, Mumcu became a symbol of
Turkey's secular tradition, established by the founder of the republic,
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.
At his funeral in Ankara, 'nearly 500,000 people walked for five hours in
the rain', according to his friend and colleague Ozgen Acar, the editor of
Cumhuriyet. 'The slogans were for secularism and the principles of Ataturk.
Since then about 25m people have demonstrated in all the cities of Turkey,
even though not more than 200,000 could have read his articles.'
Even allowing for exaggeration, Mumcu's death clearly mobilised a broad
swathe of Turkish public opinion which values the 'Kemalist' legacy very
highly, and believes it is under threat.
Three months later, at President Turgut Ozal's funeral in Istanbul, the
following slogans were shouted: 'Islamic Turkey cannot be secular.' 'Stop
this music, obey his will.'# 'We want a Moslem leader for a Moslem people.'
'This is Turkey, not Israel.' 'Santa Sofia## must be open for Moslems.'
'Turkey is Islamic, Cankaya (the presidential palace) must be Islamic.'
This was clearly an organised demonstration, possibly planned by the
Naqshbandi fraternity to which Ozal belonged, with other religious groups
and some unorganised bystanders joining in. It may even have been intended
as a direct response to the Mumcu funeral and the movement which it
unleashed.
Turgut Ozal himself would certainly not have approved of all the slogans.
Nor is his quasi-canonisation accepted by all Islamic activists. For
instance, Ismet Ozel, a leading Islamic thinker who writes for Milli
Gazetti, the newspaper of the Islamic 'Refah', or 'welfare', party, says: 'I
never considered Ozal a positive figure. Islam had no function in his
government. If he was a good Moslem it means there is no need to realise
Islam in practice, that we can accept our Moslem identity without it
influencing our daily decisions.'
From this perspective, Ozal's pro-western policies and his integration of
Turkey into the world economic system were contrary to Islam. But other
Islamic activists feel grateful to Ozal for at least making no bones about
the fact that he was a believing and practising Moslem, whereas previous
presidents had considered that any public religious gesture on their part
would infringe the secular nature of the state.
Ozal challenged the Kemalist legacy in other ways, too. He gently debunked
the orthodox Kemalist version of history, with its near-deification of
Ataturk and denigration of the Ottoman regime which he brought to an end. He
once remarked that, when at school, he had believed the text books which
depicted Abdulhamit, the Sultan deposed by the 'Young Turk' revolutionaries
in 1909 as a bloodthirsty tyrant, and disbelieved his grandfather who told
him it was not true. Only later, when he travelled abroad and was able to
read more widely, did he come to the conclusion that his grandfather had
been right.
Prof Nur Bilge Criss, a historian of the period in question, says that, as
so often in history, the truth lies somewhere between the two. But for her,
as a feminist married to a non-Moslem, Ataturk's secular legacy remains
vitally important. 'It means I am free to have dinner with you, without my
husband, and without covering my head,' she says.
To which most Turkish Islamic activists reply that they have no desire to
introduce compulsion into matters of personal morality: in their state, it
would be up to her, as a Moslem woman, to decide in her own conscience what
rules she should obey. Indignantly disclaiming any connection with Mumcu's
murder (which they suggest was a 'provocation', probably staged by some
Turkish or foreign intelligence service), they claim that all they want is
full freedom of expression and association, plus some reflection in public
life of the religion nominally professed by 98 per cent of Turkish citizens.
Some say they would even be happy with a genuine western-style secularism,
in which mosques and religious education would no longer be state-controlled
(though perhaps, when it came to the point, they would be less willing to
give up the large share of taxpayers' money now spent on such institutions).
On this ground some modern-minded Kemalists, such as Ismail Cem, of the
left-wing Republican People's Party, would be prepared to meet them.
'Secularism,' he says, 'should be a guarantee for believers as well - for
the girl who wants to wear a veil as well as the one who doesn't. The state
should hand over religion to civil society. It might be too early to discuss
this in Turkey, but we should start to tell each other that the final goal
of secularism is the 'withering away of the state' from all matters of
religion.'
To western ears, that sounds a good idea; and anyone familiar with Islamic
activists in other Moslem countries can only be struck by the moderation,
and attachment to democracy, of most of those who pass for 'fundamentalists'
in Turkish politics.
If their statements could be taken at face value, one would have to conclude
that Ataturk's revolution has succeeded, and that the Turkish state could
now afford to dismantle what is left of the iron cage in which its founder
sought to imprison the monster of Islamic obscurantism.
But most Turkish secularists, looking uneasily at the 'Islamic' states to
the east and south, do not take those statements at face value, and feel the
need to keep the beast in its cage a while yet. The battle for the Turkish
soul is far from over.
#This referred to a rumour which ran round Turkey in the days after Ozal's
death, that he had left a will directing that he be buried 'according to my
religion', and that Chopin's funeral march should not be played. Had he
really done so, it seems most unlikely that his widow would have allowed his
wishes to be ignored.
##The famous mosque in Istanbul, originally a Byzantine cathedral, was made
a secular museum on Ataturk's orders in the 1930s.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (14): The softly-softly approach has run
its course - Privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On one point Mr Ustun Sanver is adamant. 'We will never have a fire sale.
That I can promise.'
Turkey's softly-softly approach to privatisation, however, has almost run
its course. The next steps, tackling the large state monopolies, will demand
radical measures and will require a political commitment, which has largely
been missing under the current programme of disposals.
No one will begrudge Mr Sanver his achievement. In the one and a half years
since he took over the Public Participation Administration (PPA), the
government agency which handles the sale of state assets to the public,
Turkey has raised almost as much in revenues as the former Motherland party
achieved in the eight years of its administration.
Using either block sales of shares, or through sales offerings direct to the
public, Turkey is starting to run down its huge inventory of more than 230
equity participations.
When JP Morgan, the US bank, first prepared its master plan for the Turkish
privatisation programme, back in 1986, the main objective was to make the
economy 'more responsive to market forces, thereby increasing industrial
efficiency and generating growth in the real economy.' The second impulse
was to give a kickstart to Turkey's infant capital markets.
Today, with a coalition in office, the main motivation seems to be to raise
revenues to close the budget gap, the financing of which is the main cause
of the persistently high inflation.
Unlike in eastern Europe, few Turkish officials discuss the merits of
extending share ownership, although, to appease domestic opposition to the
programme, there is still an understanding that the larger state concerns
will be offered to the public first.
Whenever companies are put up for sale, there are rumblings of discontent
among the labour unions, even from the local chambers of commerce, who on
several occasions have pooled resources in an effort to buy the state
company.
As in other countries, politics is never far from the surface in Turkey's
privatisation debate. It was, after all, Mr Suleyman Demirel, the prime
minister, who, when in opposition, took legal action to block the sale of
five state cement companies to the French concern, Societe Ciment Francais,
on the grounds the shares had not first been offered to domestic investors
as required under the privatisation code. When he came to power in October
1991, Mr Demirel found himself in the awkward position of assuming the old
government's legal brief in defence of the PPA.
Earlier, offers of small stakes in Tupras, the state refineries corporation,
Petkim, the government's petrochemical concern, and Petrol Ofisi all failed
to attract much interest, when shares were sold by public offering.
The experience of recent public offerings, all of which have gone off at
half-cock, further underlines the problems. The Turkish public appears to
have little wish to become share owners. In the recent public offering of
Netas, the telecommunications equipment manufacturer now owned 51 per cent
by Northern Telecom of Canada, share applications were invited for 20 per
cent of the company. In the event, less than half that amount was
subscribed.
'We made a mistake by trying to protect the small investors,' Mr Sanver now
says. Of the 9 per cent which was sold, one fifth was bought by the
company's employees.
Mr Sanver's only satisfaction is that, after coming to the market at a sharp
discount to the issue price, Netas shares have since shot up - a vindication
of the PPA's contention that this was a blue-chip offer.
The major features of 1992 were:
The Netas sale. The PPA sold a 20 per cent block to the Canadians for
USDollars 23.5m. After the public offering, the PPA is left with some 21 per
cent of the company. Mr Sanver says the PPA is consulting a foreign bank
about the possibilities of placing the remaining stock with foreign
institutional investors.
Two Mediterranean-based state-owned power utilities, Cukurova and Kepez,
attracted considerable domestic interest, with the PPA selling the companies
for more than twice the minimum price set by the authorities. Both utilities
were sold to Rumeli Holding, owned by the Uzan family. Rumeli paid Dollars
81m for the PPA's 11.25 share of Cukurova, and a further Dollars 33m for a
25 per cent share of Kepez. The Uzan concern then proceeded, in somewhat
unconventional fashion, to solicit the proxy voting rights of the remaining
shareholders, eventually winning control of the Cukurova board.
Cement companies also proved attractive, with the PPA selling shares in six
companies, raising Dollars 281m. Two more cement companies - Sanliurfa and
Ladik - were sold in block shares in April, agin to the privately owned
Rumeli group, which is proving to have a corporate appetite previously
undetected.
Mr Sanver says the remaining seven cement plants, one in Thrace and the
remainder in the east of Turkey, all of which are still owned by the
state-run Citosan Holding, would raise around Dollars 200m.
In April, the PPA announced the sale of the Turk Automotive Industry (TOE),
which used to have the US Harvester farm machinery company franchise. The
TOE was sold for TL70bn (Dollars 6m).
Gima, the state-owned food and general store chain, was sold for TL201bn to
a local hotel concern.
A 10 per cent stake in Sekerbank, the sugar bank, was sold to the sugar beet
producers association.
Turkey's privatisation target for 1993 is TL25,000bn - more than three times
the Dollars 570m raised last year. Mr Sanver is confident the target can be
met. Planned sales include 12-15 per cent of Usas, the state airline
catering company (part owned by SAS, the Scandanavian concern); the PPA's
remaining stake in Netas; and 22 per cent of Fiat's local assembly venture
Tofas.
But, given the current pace of sales, the PPA's portfolio of companies will
soon be exhausted. The challenge then is to tackle the main public
corporations, like the PTT, the state telephone monopoly, where foreign
consultants are already discussing plans to separate the company into its
postal and telecom units.
The one encouraging sign is that, having relied on homegrown advice from
Turkish banks for much of the workload to date, the PPA is now in
discussions with a number of foreign banks, including the UK's Morgan
Grenfell, to help devise the programme for the next generation of state
sell-offs.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (12): Ceasefire demonstrates Ocalan's
control - Both Kurds and Turks hope that the long nightmare of violence may
be over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR EIGHT-and-a-half years, from August 1984 until March this year,
south-eastern Turkey was the scene of a guerrilla war, fought with equal
ruthlessness by Kurdish separatists on one side and the Turkish army on the
other.
But on March 20, from his base in Damascus, the leader of the separatist
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), Abdullah Ocalan, known as Apo, proclaimed a
25-day unilateral and unconditional ceasefire.
As a result, the traditional Kurdish new year celebrations ('Nawrouz') on
March 21 passed off peacefully, in stark contrast to last year when 105
people were killed, and three towns shelled by government forces in full
view of German TV - causing a crisis in Turco-German relations and,
indirectly, the resignation of the German defence minister (who was found to
have supplied weapons to Turkey without authorisation from the Bundestag).
Apo's decision to call the ceasefire is seen in Ankara as an acknowledgement
of military defeat, as well as a response to pressure from his Syrian hosts
and from the Iraqi Kurds who were determined not to let him jeopardise
Turkish support for their 'safe haven'. Certainly the army has inflicted
severe losses on his units in south-eastern Turkey over the past year, while
in northern Iraq fellow Kurds have forced the PKK to move well away from the
Turkish border.
But the fact that the ceasefire has held amounts to something of a political
victory for Apo, since it shows his ability to control guerrilla forces
scattered over a wide and ruggedly mountainous region. The Turkish side,
too, has shown discipline: the government, which had two weeks' warning of
the ceasefire, gave strict instructions to its forces not to overreact to
any non-violent demonstrations during Nawrouz, and by and large these were
obeyed.
Last month, when the 25 days were up, Apo prolonged the ceasefire
indefinitely. In fact, he announced he was abandoning the armed struggle in
favour of peaceful politics, and that his aim was no longer a separate state
but recognition of Kurdish rights within Turkey. For good measure, he
renounced his former Marxist principles as well.
It all seems too good to be true, and may yet prove to be. There was a
similar moment of hope at the end of 1991, when the present government came
to power. Then, too, Apo had spoken of a federal solution, and hinted at a
ceasefire; and the prime minister, Mr Suleyman Demirel, toured the
south-east proclaiming his determination to treat its people democratically
and his recognition of the Kurdish identity. But at that time neither's
words were reflected in the actions of his troops, and the war soon resumed
more fiercely than ever.
This time, both Kurds and Turks are hoping desperately that the long
nightmare of violence may really be at an end, but no one is betting on it.
Turks find it difficult to believe Mr Ocalan can have changed his spots
completely, and Kurds wonder if the government has the courage and
imagination to seize the opportunity he has offered.
Many see the death of President Turgut Ozal on April 17 as tragically
untimely. He had done more than anyone to open up the debate on Kurdish
identity within the Turkish establishment, exploiting both his own partly
Kurdish origins (he claimed to remember speaking the language with his
grandmother) and the crisis over the Iraqi Kurds which followed the Gulf
war. He struck up a personal leadership with the Iraqi Kurdish leaders,
particularly Jalal Talabani of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), who
has played a key role in persuading Apo to switch to a non-violent strategy.
Although Ozal no longer controlled the executive, since his Motherland party
lost power in the 1991 general election, he did chair the National Security
Council, and continued to take a close interest in the Kurdish issue. Many
observers doubt whether, in his absence, the government will be able to take
the decisions needed to defuse Kurdish grievances, or be brave enough to
impose them on the armed forces.
But Ismet Imset, a Turkish journalist who has become the country's leading
expert on the PKK, believes Ozal had already made his vital contribution by
bringing the Kurdish issue into the open and changing the way people think
about it - including senior figures in all the main political parties.
Imset says that people who called him a traitor two years ago, when he
published his first interview with Apo, now ring him up to ask his advice.
Indeed, he is known to have briefed the cabinet informally after his most
recent trips to interview the PKK leader in Syria and Lebanon.
In any case, it is Suleyman Demirel who will now have to take the crucial
decisions, whether as prime minister or as a president who will still have
great influence over the main governing party. Interviewed by the Financial
Times last month, he claimed not to 'hear' Apo's pronouncements, arguing
that to do so would amount to opening a dialogue. At the same time he could
only welcome the ceasefire as a fact, and hinted at a possible amnesty for
Kurdish fighters who came down from the mountains 'to seek justice under
Turkish regular law'.
It seems likely, if the situation remains calm, that the state of emergency
in the south-east, under which the army's more repressive actions are
carried out, will soon be lifted. A big public investment package for the
south-east, whose economic backwardness is widely seen as the root cause of
the trouble, has already been announced.
But Demirel is much more reluctant to commit himself, as some of his
advisers are urging, to allowing the Kurdish language to be used in schools,
or on private radio and television - two of the most widely voiced Kurdish
demands. (For the last two years it has been allowed in newspapers and in
public speech; and in March the interior minister, Ismet Sezgin, announced a
further significant concession: the restoration of Kurdish names to
thousands of renamed towns and villages. Parents will also be free
henceforth to give their children Kurdish names.)
Ocalan's official demand is now for a federal solution - something President
Ozal also spoke about once or twice in rather vague terms. Many Kurds would
regard that as the ideal, but most know it is very unlikely to happen at all
soon. Many - some say a majority - would not benefit directly from it in any
case, since they no longer live in the south-east but in the big cities of
western Turkey.
Perhaps the most striking fact about the situation today, compared with a
few years ago, is the total freedom with which the issue is now discussed,
and the passion with which Turkish Kurds now proclaim their Kurdish
identity. For many of them this seems quite compatible with a strong Turkish
patriotism. But even those who most firmly condemn the PKK's violence and
reject its separatism also warn that it has genuine popular support, and
that from now on the Turkish state cannot afford to ignore Kurdish
aspirations.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (11): A fresh start to an uncertain end -
Heinz Kramer discusses the country's relations with the European Community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HEINZ KRAMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RELATIONS between Turkey and the European Community seem to be back to
normal after more than a decade of tensions and frustrations.
On November 9 last year, the Association Council was able to agree on a
variety of measures which are intended to bring new life to the dormant
EC-Turkey association agreement.
After more than a decade of inaction, it was decided to resume work on the
completion of the customs union which, according to the agreement, should be
established by the end of 1995. Added to this was the creation of a
political dialogue between the EC and Turkey on the highest level - ie,
including head of states and governments. First meetings of newly
established or revived groups of experts, among which the Customs
Co-operation Committee ranks most prominently, and the visit of Turkey's
deputy prime minister, Erdal Inonu, to Brussels and other EC capitals in
early 1993 underline the seriousness of the new approach.
Turkey, in compliance with its contractual obligations, put into effect, as
of January 1, 1993, further reductions of its customs tariffs for imports
from the Community at a magnitude of 10 to 20 per cent; and it abolished
various special funds for which, in past years, extra levies on imports had
been charged. Such levies contravene the stipulations of the association
agreement.
The continuing economic problems posed to the Turkish economy by the
creation of the customs union are, however, revealed by the exemption from
the tariff reductions of certain sectors of business like automobiles,
pharmaceuticals and chemicals, after heavy pressure put on the government by
representatives of these sectors which fear for their international
competitiveness.
The extra levies, too, have not really been abolished together with the
funds, but instead have been transferred to the still existing mass-housing
fund, the rates of which have been slightly raised. Hence, the most recent
Turkish measures can be regarded as another step in the right direction, but
still leave much to do if the deadline is to be met.
Turkey is at least showing goodwill in its efforts to normalise relations
with the EC. The Community, on its side, still has difficulties in
reciprocating. Greece, because of its perennial bilateral conflicts with
Turkey over Cyprus and the situation in the Aegean Sea, continues to block
any substantial moves of the Twelve towards an improvement. For this reason,
there is no prospect of releasing Community aid to Turkey of a magnitude of
600m Ecu pledged under the fourth financial protocol initialled in 1981, nor
is there any hope of fully implementing a comprehensive package of technical
and economic co-operation measures presented to the Council of Ministers by
the Commission in July 1990, the so-called Matutes package.
The Twelve are also very reluctant to phase out the non-tariff trade
barriers which, in clear violation of the association agreement, impede the
free import of Turkish textiles and clothing into EC markets, and which have
to be abolished if the customs union is to be a reality. Other measures
foreseen in the association agreement, such as free movement of workers, not
to speak of Turkish accession to the EC (for which Turkey applied in April
1987), are much further away from being seriously considered.
By concentrating on the details of the association agreement, one could get
the impression that economic issues are at the heart of EC-Turkey relations.
Nothing could be more misleading. The association, from its very beginning
in the early 1960s, was mainly intended to serve political ends. EC members
wanted to bind closer to the west a country deemed to be an indispensable
ally in countering the strategic threat from the east.
The Turkish political and economic elite, on their side, saw EC membership
as the final objective which would make irreversible Turkey's
'westernisation', begun by the founder of the republic, Mustafa Kemal
Ataturk. Hence, Turkey's relations with the EC in the framework of the
association agreement have always been influenced more by political factors
than by economic developments.
This also applies to the new momentum created by the meeting of the
Association Council of last November. Although the former political basis of
the relationship has been eroded by the collapse of the Soviet empire, 'the
Turkish role in the present European situation is of the greatest
importance', in the words approved by the European Council at last June's
Lisbon summit. EC members view Turkey as an important stabilising factor,
not only in the Middle East but also in the crisis-ridden process of
restructuring the Soviet heritage in Central Asia and the Caucasus, as well
as in relation to the re-opened European powderkeg in the Balkans. Hence the
great interest in high level political dialogue with Ankara.
In Turkey, the international attention attracted by the country's new
strategic role has created a climate of growing self-assertiveness, best
represented by the remark of late president Turgut Ozal on the occasion of
the summit of Turkic republics last October, that the 21st century will be
the 'Turkish century'. But the Ankara government also realises that, in
order to meet European expectations and its own aspirations, Turkey needs
the support of strong partners. Ankara, therefore, is able and ready to
downgrade its sensitivity concerning political differences with the
Community, and to do its share in the efforts for a revitalisation of
relations, which seems to be in the interest of both sides.
But the change in the international environment has even more far-reaching
consequences. Both Turkey and the EC are using new mental maps. In Turkey,
the public is increasingly aware that there is more to the definition of
modern Turkish identity than Anatolia, the nation, and Europe-orientated
'westernisation'. The emergence of a new 'Turkish world', stretching from
the Balkans to western China, has encouraged a new emphasis on Islam as well
as nationalism, and will contribute to a re-assessment of Turkey's European
bonds.
On the other hand, in the European public and among its political elites,
awareness may grow that the former 'community of fate'
(Schicksalsgemeinschaft) between western Europe and Turkey in the field of
security policy no longer exists. The EC and Turkey will in future be
confronted with quite different strategic challenges. All this may lead to a
certain alienation between the two sides, of which the first signs are
already visible. It is certainly not mere chance that Turkey has hardly been
mentioned in the EC's public debate about 'deepening versus widening'.
Efforts at normalisation of EC-Turkey relations 'in line with the prospect
laid down in the Association Agreement of 1964' (Lisbon European Council)
may become increasingly entangled in the task of defining the final
political goal of the relationship beyond the establishment of a customs
union.
The prevailing uncertainty about the future development of the EC, of
Turkey, and of the wider Europe raises the question whether strictly
following the paths set out in a quite different past is really the best way
to set about forging a common future. Finding an answer to this question may
become the real challenge for the European-Turkish political dialogue at the
highest level.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (10): Euphoria has evaporated - John Murray
Brown examines Turkey's role within Central Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year ago, such a trip would have generated considerable public interest.
But when the late President Turgut Ozal set off on a gruelling five-country
tour of Central Asia last month, it merited scarcely a comment in the local
Turkish press.
Turks, like many outside the country, are starting to make a more sober
assessment of the opportunities offered in the newly created Turkic-speaking
states of former Soviet Central Asia.
Much of the euphoria has evaporated. At first, Ankara took it as welcome
vindication that the leaders of Central Asia seemed to aspire to follow
their own moves to open up to the west, a process started when Mustafa Kemal
Ataturk founded the country on the ruins of the Ottoman Empire in the 1920s.
However, as one academic, familiar with the region, put it: 'They said much
the same thing to Brezhnev and Stalin.'
Turkey's strategic role as a moderate secular counterweight to Iranian
fundamentalism has probably been overplayed. What has also been overblown is
Turkey's capacity to play a role as the catalyst for economic development in
the region, given budget problems at home.
'Turkey is not pretending to be a regional power. All we want is to help
them make a soft landing in coming into the new world,' says Mr Ozdem
Sanberk, under secretary at the Tukish foreign ministry.
Turkey shares common cultural, linguistic and religious ties. But the
physical limits to co-operation are immense. Turkey has no common border
with any of the five Central Asian states, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan,
Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Even with the Caucasian state of
Azerbaijan, Turkey is cut off by Christian Armenia.
The Turks have made much of the pipeline accord to take Azerbaijan's crude
to the Mediterranean. But this project, like all similar proposals to
provide a route to take the region's vast natural resources to western
markets, depends on the co-operation of Iran - and if not Iran, then the
Armenians, with whom Turkey has an equally troubled relationship.
No one is denying that Turkey will have a role to play. Turkish banks are
setting up operations in the region. Ziraat, the state-owned farm credit
bank, has established joint ventures in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and most
recently in Turkmenistan.
'The general strategy is to be the first western bank. The market is not
large enough for two international banks,' says Can Oner, the director in
charge of Central Asian operations.
Significantly, it is the state sector banks which have led the way. Private
banks remain more wary. 'Ziraat is the first in. It may make sense. If you
are a local bank you perceive the risks differently. However, look what is
happening in Russia, surely a better prospect. As far as I know only two
foreign banks have progressed past the stage of having a representative
office,' says a London-based trade finance specialist. Bankers admit it is
still almost impossible to quantify the risk in those areas.
Nonetheless Turkey has already much of the legal infrastructure, such as
investment protection agreements and accords on the prevention of double
taxation. Since the area opened up, Turkey has signed more than 100
bilateral accords with these countries.
Latest trade figures suggest, at least as far as cash transactions are
concerned, the opening up of Central Asia has had little impact on Turkey's
balance of payments. For the 11 months to November 1992, Turkey's total
exports to the former republics of the Soviet Union came to Dollars 1063m,
little more than the Dollars 986m achieved in the same period in 1991.
Moreover Russia accounted for Dollars 909m. Import statistics reveal a
similar picture.
Trade volume - imports and exports - with the Turkic states was less than
Dollars 300m. While the figures probably do not include barter items, they
nonetheless emphasise that Turkish trade ties with the region remain very
modest.
But some multinationals are looking at links with Turkish groups, to gain an
early foothold in these markets. Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss confectionery
group owned by Philip Morris, has acquired a 50 per cent share in Turkey's
largest edible-oil company. The strategy is to use this Turkish operation to
market the whole range of Jacobs Suchard products in Turkey and the Central
Asian states. Merloni, the Italian white goods concern, best known for its
Ariston brand, has acquired a stake in Turkey's Vestel electronics group,
again in a bid to provide a platform for sales to the Caucasus and beyond.
In areas like telecommunications, Netas, Northern Telecom of Canada's
Turkish subsidiary, is blazing a trail. With the help of a government
project to supply digital switches for public exchanges to all five Central
Asian republics, Turkey's private telephone manufacturers are quietly
stealing a march on some of the larger foreign names. On the back of this,
Ankara is beaming Turkish television - a move which will have important
strategic consequences for the chances of Turkish groups.
Indeed, the Turks are in the vanguard in a range of infrastructure projects.
John Laing, the UK civil engineering group, has a contract in partnership
with Turkey's Alarko Holding to build the airport at Ashkabad, the
Turkmenistan capital.
Cultural bonds are also being slowly forged. More than 8,000 students are
now studying in Turkish universities. There are even cadets from the area in
Turkey's military academies.
Following a conference earlier this year, Ankara announced it was to add
five new letters to the Turkish alphabet, in a bid to encourage the
republics to adopt the Latin script, something they lost in the early 1920s
after Stalin, then minister for minorities, forced them to take up Cyrillic.
Political dividends have been harder to come by. Many Central Asian leaders
went away from the Ankara summit last year, disappointed that Turkey was
unable to offer more than worthy statements.
What is emerging is that many of these states retain a strong dependence on
Russia, economically and politically. Some would suggest there are even some
sentimental ties. It seems it will difficult for the Central Asians to sever
their links with Moscow.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (9): At the centre of an unstable region -
Foreign policy, the strategic surroundings have changed beyond recognition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the four decades of the cold war, Turkey experienced economic
transformation and many internal upheavals, but its only serious foreign
policy problems resulted from the conflict in Cyprus and its consequently
very difficult relationship with Greece.
Otherwise it was a rock-solid Nato ally, maintaining cold but polite
relations with its Soviet neighbour to the north and holding aloof from the
quarrels of its Arab and Persian neighbours to the south and east.
Since 1990, however, Turkey's strategic surroundings have changed beyond
recognition. The Cyprus issue, though still unresolved, has become the least
of Turkey's immediate worries as the country finds itself, in the words of
its foreign minister, Mr Hikmet Cetin, 'at the centre of a region of
instability and conflict'. In three neighbouring areas - Iraq to the
south-east, the Caucasus to the north-east, and the Balkans to the
north-west - conflicts have erupted from which Turkey finds it impossible to
stay aloof.
In the Gulf war of 1991 Turkey was an essential western ally. Without
Turkish help, sanctions against Iraq would have been meaningless and the
bombing campaign more difficult. Then, in the immediate aftermath of the
war, Turkey was at the centre of a major crisis as hundreds of thousands of
Kurdish refugees poured across its border. It was from Turkish territory
that western forces entered northern Iraq in April 1991, to set up the 'safe
haven' for the Kurds; and it is still from Turkish territory that that haven
is protected by western air surveillance.
Thus western strategy for containing President Saddam Hussein's regime
remains heavily dependent on Turkish co-operation, under an agreement which
has to be renewed every six months. Less explicitly, the west also relies on
Turkish help in containing Iran, a state whose revolutionary ideology and
politico-military ambitions are viewed with deep suspicion, especially in
Washington.
In both cases Turkey's ruling elite finds good self-interested reasons for
co-operating with the west: it neither wants Turkey's secular democracy
undermined by subversion from Islamic Iran, nor its problems in the
impoverished and mainly Kurdish south-east exacerbated by a new Baathist
onslaught on the Kurds across the border in Iraq. But the government has to
be careful how it handles a Turkish public opinion which is strongly
nationalistic, and dislikes seeing its country used as a springboard for
western intimidation of neighbouring Moslem countries.
Meanwhile, the break-up of the Soviet Union has 'liberated' eight new
independent states along the Asiatic fringe of Russia, three of which are
Turkey's immediate neighbours in the Caucasus, and five of which have
national languages closely related to Turkish. Initially this was greeted
with excitement, not to say euphoria, in Turkey, which saw itself cast as
elder brother or guardian to this new 'Turkic' universe.
That has now largely given way to a more sober appraisal, which stresses the
responsibilities and pitfalls of guardianship as much as its joys and
rewards. In the Caucasus especially, Turkish policy-makers fear being
dragged into the bitter war over Nagorno-Karabakh, the mainly
Armenian-populated enclave which has declared its independence from
Azerbaijan, and has been fighting with some success to secure a land
corridor linking it to Armenia proper.
Turkish public opinion is strongly on the side of the Azeris, seeing them as
fellow-Turks and victims of aggression. There has even been loose talk of
military intervention against Armenia, whose denials of direct involvement
in the conflict do not convince anyone in Turkey.
But the government is acutely aware of the damage such a course would
inflict on Turkey's image in the west, especially in the US and France where
strong Armenian lobbies have kept alive the memory of the massacres of
Armenians under the Ottoman empire, which they describe as genocide.
It also fears a clash with Russia in what has traditionally been a Russian
sphere of influence.
So Turkey has done its best to maintain an even-handed approach, and to
overcome the Armenians' traditional Turcophobia. Early this year it even
supplied Armenia with up to 100,000 tons of wheat, from stocks earmarked for
domestic consumption, as an advance on wheat promised by the EC which was
late arriving; and Mr Cetin has been working with his Russian counterpart,
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, to revive the flagging peace process sponsored by the
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).
The Armenian victory at Kelbajar in early April, widening the corridor to
between 30 and 40km, put this Turkish policy under acute strain. Turkey
responded by halting relief to Armenia. But the presidents of both Armenia
and Azerbaijan, meeting for the first time at the funeral of President
Turgut Ozal in Ankara on April 21, agreed to establish a direct bilateral
dialogue, with a 'hot line' between their capitals.
The Turks also used the occasion to give the Armenian leader a firm warning.
'We made it very clear to him,' says Ozdem Sanberk, the top civil servant in
the Turkish foreign ministry, 'that he should explain to his people that
these so-called victories are not good for the future.
Armenia is an enclave among Moslem countries and must live in peace with
them. It should not rely only on support from lobbies in California. . . We
can live without Armenia. They can live without Turkey, but in trouble.'
Unlike Armenia and northern Iraq, Bosnia is not Turkey's immediate
neighbour, and the war there does not affect Turkey's national security so
directly. But in emotional terms it is easily the most sensitive of the
three surrounding crises. As Mr Cetin says, 'Turkey is a Balkan country'.
All of the Balkans were Ottoman territory until the 19th century - Bosnia
and Hercegovina being lost finally in 1908. Turks have feelings of both
kinship and responsibility for the Moslems left behind there, kept alive
partly (but by no means solely) by the descendants of those who left and
settled in Turkey: some 4m 'Bosniaks' are today Turkish citizens.
These feelings have been fanned by Moslem religious leaders, and reached a
peak in January this year when the bombing of Iraq was contrasted with
western passivity towards the Serbs, with many bitter accusations of 'double
standards'. This makes the secular and pro-western Turkish government very
nervous, and it has done its best to pre-empt Islamic exploitation of the
issue both at home and abroad.
Turkey itself raised the issue at the Organisation of the Islamic
Conference, with Mr Cetin talking wildly at one point of oil embargoes
against the west.
Turkey has also repeatedly offered to join in any UN or Nato-organised
military intervention. As in other countries, however, the army is
understood to be distinctly unenthusiastic about deploying troops on the
ground, and unilateral intervention has been firmly ruled out.
As long ago as August 8 last year, Turkey proposed an 'action plan' aimed at
'convincing the aggressor that the world means business'. It included the
following elements:
Establishment and enforcement of a no-fly zone;
Limited military intervention in the form of selective strikes, with Serb
heavy weapons as the main targets; and
Lifting the embargo on arms supplies to the Bosnian government.
Mr Cetin notes sadly that the international community has now come round to
at least part of this plan. But, he says, 'we fear it is too little, too
late'. He worries that, 'if the Serbs succeed, they will be encouraged to do
the same in Kosovo', where 90 per cent of the population are ethnic
Albanians - also mainly Moslem. His officials fear that, if that happens,
the fighting will inevitably spill over into Macedonia and perhaps involve
neighbouring countries, bringing it ever nearer to Turkey's borders.
Differences over the Balkans have become a new source of friction between
Turkey and Greece, which last month refused to let Turkish F-16s pass
through its air space on their way to help enforce the Bosnian no-fly zone.
And Greek hostility continues to complicate Turkey's relations with both the
US, where the Greek lobby keeps a lid on military aid to Turkey, and the EC,
where Greece vetoes not only Turkey's eventual membership but also more
immediate financial aid.
Yet in spite of repeated rebuffs, Turkish ministers and officials remain
convinced of the country's European destiny. They are busily preparing for
the customs union with the EC (due at the end of 1995), and have eagerly
taken up associate membership of the Western European Union, now officially
enshrined as Europe's 'defence component'. So far from being distracted by
their new regional role, they believe that it increases their value as an
ally and partner, and that west Europeans will come round at last to the
view that, without Turkey, Europe is incomplete.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (8): Construction 'megaprojects' under way
 -Turkey has the engineers and the contracting companies. But does it have
the funds?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Suleyman Demirel, the prime minister, used to refer to the constraining
effects of Turkey's infrastructure as 'a giant in pygmy's clothing.'
Now his rhetoric is of Dollars 135bn of 'mega projects', which will change
the country.
Promoted abroad and at home among finance sources and contractors, these
include:
The Southeastern Anatolian Projects (GAP). Launched in the mid-1980s, this
huge project is harnessing the Tigris and Euphrates to irrigate 1.7m
hectares of land - half the size of Belgium - and build 18 hydro-electric
stations.
The heart of the project is the Dollars 2.3bn Ataturk Dam which, when
completed, will be the world's ninth largest dam.
Syria and Iraq object to Turkey's use of the rivers. Their objections means
international funding has been held back. The project is due to be finished
in 2005, at a total cost of Dollars 32bn.
Rail. A 430km Dollars 4bn high-speed train connection between Ankara and the
Asian side of the Istanbul, with a Dollars 4bn rail tunnel under the
Bosporus, connecting the European and Middle Eastern rail nets.
The government has said that agreement with contractors should be reached by
October 27 this year. These are part of what Turkey calls a Peace Train from
Paris to Jerusalem via Turkey.
Raising their sights higher, Turkey talks of a Silk Railway following the
old Silk Route from London to China, passing through Turkey and the Turkic
Republics.
Motorways. This year Turkey plans to bring into service a further 448km of
motorway, extending the road grid to 1,250km and virtually completing the
link from the trans-European motorway to Ankara.
It has an additional 347km under construction, and is planning a bridge by
Gallipoli across the Dardanelles.
Electric Energy. Government plans allow for a 69 per cent increase in
electricity capacity by the year 2000. This is to be achieved by completing
13 generating plants currently under construction and starting 14 others,
including a 1,000MW nuclear plant. However, the World Bank is worried about
the high debt of the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK).
The Bank argues that Turkey runs more generating capacity than it needs.
Water and Sewerage. Projects worth Dollars 2.7bn in Istanbul alone,
including the world's largest biological sewage treatment plant and the
150-mile diversion of a river. Also, a Dollars 3bn Aegean-Mediterranean
coastal infrastructure programme.
Other projects on this 'mega list' include work on nine airports; a Dollars
750m world trade centre for Istanbul; four ports, including a deep-water
port at Yumurtalik near Adana, and a container port to serve Istanbul at
Tekirdag, on the Marmara; underground and light rail systems in Istanbul,
Ankara and Izmir; hydro-cracking units at the main refineries; and an
Olympic stadium for Istanbul.
Turkey now has the engineers and contracting companies capable of handling
many of these. But does it have the funds?
This year, the government will find and spend Dollars 12bn, according to Dr
Ilhan Kesici, under-secretary of the State Planning Organisation. He argues
that a combination of central government funding, foreign finance, and
franchise-based schemes will see Turkey through. However, Turkey has been
notoriously slow in completing negotiations on the Build Operate-Transfer
schemes on which it is partly pinning its hopes.
The World Bank is among those who take a more cautious view, being prepared
to support many of the projects but arguing for a slower phasing.
Indeed, as so often, the shortage of funds means that, for all its 'mega'
hopes, Turkey may have to live with some of its old clothing longer than it
wants to.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (4): 'I've been careful to control my
attitude' - Four times prime minister, twice deposed by a military coup, and
now almost certain to be elected president, Suleyman Demirel is the
arch-survivor of Turkish politics. Two days after the death of President
Turgut Ozal last month, Mr Demirel talked to Edward Mortimer and John Murray
Brown

<TEXT>
Some Turks are saying President's Ozal's death marks the end of an era in
Turkish politics. How do you evaluate his contribution?
Let me say this. I knew him for almost 43 years. Between 1965 and 1971 he
was my adviser, then he was under-secretary of the planning division: I put
him there.
In 1979, I brought him into the administration again. Later we had some
problems, because between 1980 and 1987 I was not free.
In 1991 we campaigned to remove him from Cankaya (the presidential palace).
We were not able to get enough votes, and since then I've been very careful
to control my attitude, so as to protect the country from any harm. And now
this happened, I am awfully sorry. Because once you have so many years as
friends, it doesn't matter what happens in the last five or 10.
Do you think those who are pressing you to accept the presidency really want
you to step down from power?
(laughing) That's possible] But the president is very important. He can
prevent both government and parliament from functioning. The president
should have some understanding, and be helpful to the government.
Even if it is composed of parties difference from his own?
When you become president, you should forget the parties.
Mr Ozal is credited with opening the way to a solution of the Kurdish
problem. What is your attitude?
One can argue about that. The problems are still there. None of them have
been solved.
Abdullah Ocalan (head of the rebel Kurdistan Workers' Party) has agreed to
extend his ceasefire. Are you closer to a solution?
We never hear him, whatever he says. If you start hearing him, then he
becomes a party to the problem. If we make him a party to the problem, then
we should be dealing with him. We should never deal with him. I don't think
we should deal with the man attacking us.
We won't tell him 'don't stop', but nor will we tell him 'we are very happy
that you've stopped', and then negotiate.
How helpful a role has been played by Mr Jalal Talabani and the Iraqi Kurds?
I saw Talabani five or six days ago, and told him: 'You shouldn't be a
mediator between the Turkish state and those terrorists, but if you think
they are Kurds killing Kurds, brothers killing brothers, then if you as a
Kurd yourself say it should be stopped, it is up to you'.
I am not telling him 'don't do anything', but 'don't be a mediator, don't
get any instructions from us'. I am not closing the door. We don't want
bloodshed. We are trying to have a soft approach to the problem. We offer
them justice and the rule of law.
Justice or even a degree of clemency?
Actually there are laws. They can benefit from the 'repentance' law, and
parliament may even enlarge it.
Would part of this soft approach be to allow Kurdish schools, or introduce
the Kurdish language into schools?
No, that is something else. We won't do anything which would be understood
as a gain for terrorism. Then we wouldn't be able to run this country.
But leaving terrorism aside, might there not be a strong case for doing it
in its own right?
If there is a strong case for anything else to be done, we will do it, but
not now, because then it would be seen as a concession, which would fuel
terrorism in the coming years.
What does Kemalism mean in the 1990s?
Kemalism, as we understand it, is not a regime. It's a target. Ataturk said
the supreme willpower of the nation should govern the country. He said the
people of Turkey should reach contemporary civilisation. If that's Kemalism,
I'm a Kemalist.
What about his principles of 'etatism' and secularism?
In 1923 the Turkish state had about 10m people and its cities were
devastated by war. There weren't enough private entrepreneurs, and they
didn't have enough capital or know-how, so the state had to step in.
When you come to 1980, the whole thing changes: having the state in the
economy does not pay now. But secularism is very important. It's actually a
protection of the right of religion: you can believe as you want.
What is your reaction to recent gains by the (Islamic) Welfare Party?
It's very local. They can get up to 15 per cent, not more than that.
Is Turkey still on schedule for customs union with the EC in 1995? Will you
scrap the mass housing fund by then?
It has to be negotiated. You know, Turkey is the only country that is going
to be in a customs union without being a member of the EC. Definitely Turkey
should negotiate that.
When do you expect to start these negotiations?
Very soon, whenever the EC is ready.
Is full membership still a realistic objective?
In 10 years, maybe. Turkey may be a full member with some exceptional
conditions. It depends on the Community, but I think within the next 10
years Turkey should be a full member.
You know, membership for Turkey means catching up with Europe. If we feel we
can catch that level, for us I think the target is reached.
How dangerous for Turkey is the situation in the Caucasus?
We are being pushed, and we are under pressure from pro-Azerbaijani public
opinion. People say we should intervene. Actually we can intervene, but that
won't be the end of the problem. Maybe the problem will start when you
intervene.
We intervened in Cyprus, but we still have the problem there. Bosnia is a
different thing. In Bosnia you have the international community, but in the
Caucasus only Turkey is under pressure. If the international community wants
to intervene to settle the problem, then Turkey will a partner.
As in Bosnia, if the international community decides to intervene, we will
supply forces, but we cannot intervene by ourselves. Whatever we do, we
should do it with the world.
That means the Russians have a veto?
Yes. We should do it with the world including the Russians, as in the case
of Kuwait. Russia should be convinced what needs to be done. In the case of
the Caucasus, too, Russia shouldn't be left out. On Bosnia there are some
efforts. Let us hope they will have some results. Pressure will be put on
the Serbs.
Up to now there was no deterrent factor. Now Nato is going to control the
no-fly zone. Our planes left for Italy today.
Is a deterrent needed on the ground as well?
It's up to the soldiers to evaluate that. But now Nato has been put into
force, let us see how things will develop.
And what is your policy towards Central Asia? Is it going to lead to a
revival of Pan-Turkism?
People in Central Asia and in Anatolia speak the same language. They share
the same history, the same traditions . . . They are our cousins, but we
have never lived in the same state. Therefore Pan-Turkism is just a Utopia.
All we want is that they stay as independent states. They should be running
themselves: we do not have any desire to run those countries.
What about a Turkic commonwealth, an economic commonwealth?
Not for the time being. Actually we have an agreement between Iran, Turkey,
Pakistan and the Central Asian states, called ECO. If we can develop some
regional economic relations, why not? All we want is these countries to open
up to the world. They used to know the world as only Moscow. Now they have
seen that there is a world beyond Moscow.
We have given them a lot of help: we have 10,000 students in Turkish
schools; we have provided TV and telephones; we have 42 agreements signed.
More than 500 Turkish companies are working in those countries. Relations
will be bilateral, based on economic interest.
Is this pulling Turkey in another direction, away from the EC?
Our desire to be a member of the EC is not for economic factors only. We are
Europeans. We would like to stay as Europeans. We would like to live with
Europe. We would like to act with Europe. We share the values of European
civilisation in addition to our own values. As a member of Nato, we have
defended those values. Europe is not a geography: Europe is a set of values.
If Europe says, 'we don't want you to defend our values', that is something
else. But if I were Europe I should say, 'Let us have more people defending
our values'. We can take those values to Central Asia. That is the extension
of Europe, not as geography but as culture, as civilisation. In Bishkek
(capital of Kyrgyzstan), for instance, 75 per cent of the population are
Russians and Germans. They are Europeans. It's a beautiful city: it's not an
Asian city, its a European city. They're all intermingled.
Are you implying that those countries, too, might be members of the EC?
Not for the time being. But as Turks, we can take European values to those
countries.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (5): Support for coalition - The views of
the deputy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ERDAL Inonu, a distinguished physicist and son of Turkey's second president,
is deputy prime minister and leader of the Social Democratic People's Party
(SHP). He gave these views to the FT:
On the government: For us it is important that the coalition continues,
independently of the role of the president. It has a good majority behind it
in parliament. If the prime minister becomes president it will be a big
change, but the parties have a sound basis in the country and do not depend
on personalities.
On the economy and privatisation: 'Etatism' is now understood by our party
as defining the social character of the state, not in the sense of the 1930s
when the state was the primary means of industrialisation and accumulation
of capital. We are not against privatisation, but it is not easy to
privatise so many important concerns. What is important is not the ownership
but the efficient use of the means of production, and a good distribution.
On the Kurds: We are encouraged by the fact that the terrorist groups say
they will not engage in terrorism any more. We are not afraid of a
separatist Kurdish party, because we believe it would not gain sufficient
votes to achieve its ends. But it does require a change in the constitution,
and the present government has not yet said it will support such a change.
Turkish is the official language, and must be used by the organs of the
state. But we have signed the Paris Charter, and are fully committed to
giving cultural rights to all citizens. Parliament is in the process of
legalising private radio and television stations. Once that is done, we
can't stop them using Kurdish.
On human rights: Terrorist activity accelerated for a while after we came to
power. The security forces also increased their activity, making it look as
if there were more violations of human rights. But the law on judicial
practices has brought American standards to bear on our criminal procedures,
and is now used in a great part of the country, except for terrorist cases.
With the disappearance of terrorism we won't have any more complaints from
Amnesty International.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (3): The end of an era - President Turgut
Ozal, who was the dominant figure in Turkish politics for the last ten
years, died on April 17.  Edward Mortimer assesses his achievements and
legacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO TURKISH leader since the founder of the republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk,
has presided over such profound changes in his country as Turgut Ozal, who
was prime minister from 1983 to 1989, and president from then until his
death three weeks ago. And none, at least since Adnan Menderes (prime
minister throughout the 1950s), has set his personal stamp so firmly on the
country's politics.
Ozal chose to be buried close to Menderes's grave in Istanbul, which
suggests he may have thought of him as a precursor. Both moved Turkish
politics in a democratic direction after a period of authoritarian rule,
while relaxing the state's grip on the economy and presiding over a period
of rapidly growing prosperity. Both were firmly pro-western in their foreign
policy: while Menderes sent troops to Korea and took Turkey into Nato, Ozal
applied for EC membership and let Turkish bases be used for operations
against Iraq during and after the Gulf war.
Both found ways of exploiting the Turkish people's profound attachment to
Islam without directly challenging Ataturk's legacy of secularism.
Similarly, both contrived to be seen as more sympathetic, or at any rate
less oppressive, than their predecessors by the Kurdish population of
south-eastern Turkey, though both remained firmly committed to the unity of
the country even if it had to be maintained by force.
Both, moreover, were highly controversial figures, seen by many as gathering
too much power in their own hands and using it to enrich themselves and
their families. Both suffered political defeat at the end of their lives.
But, while Menderes was overthrown by a military coup and subsequently
hanged, Ozal first lost control of his own party and then saw it defeated at
the polls, being thus obliged for the last year and a half of his presidency
to cohabit with a government formed by his opponents.
He remained in office, but out of power - a situation he exploited to regain
popularity by making public gestures or statements going beyond government
policy on various issues, in a direction favoured by public sentiment. His
sudden death provoked an outpouring of genuine grief which, while not quite
unanimous, went much wider than his popularity had done while he was in
power. Many Turks realised only then how much he had done to change their
lives, mostly for the better.
That Ozal's career ended so much more happily and peacefully than that of
Menderes reflects the fact that in fostering democracy, as in most other
respects, he had been able to take things further than Menderes did. It
would be hard to say how far that was due to his personal qualities, and how
far to the simple fact that, in spite of setbacks, the process of change had
continued during the intervening generation. No doubt whoever ruled Turkey
during the 1980s would have been obliged to open up the economy to the
outside world, and whoever was elected to power after the military regime of
1980-3 would have gradually relaxed political constraints and allowed
greater freedom.
In the latter respect, Ozal in fact moved fairly gingerly. Although his
coming to power in 1983 was undoubtedly a slap in the face for the generals,
who had intended the election to be won by one of their own number, it is
also true that it could not have happened but for the ban on the entire
pre-1980 political leadership which the generals had imposed.
As prime minister with President Kenan Evren, the author of the 1980 coup
looking over his shoulder, Ozal took only slow and cautious steps to
dismantle censorship and other restrictions or to curb human rights
violations. In the referendum on restoring political rights to the banned
leaders, by then his rivals, he took a formally neutral position.
Suleyman Demirel, the pre-coup prime minister who had brought Ozal into
government as an economic technician, always regarded his subsequent
emergence in a political role as tainted with illegitimacy. Demirel also
contested the legitimacy of Ozal's election as president in 1989 by a
parliamentary majority which, at that point, was far from reflecting a
majority in the country. Having had his revenge in 1991, when he trounced
Ozal's party at the polls and came back as prime minister, Demirel now faces
the bitter-sweet prospect of succeeding Ozal as president in rather similar
circumstances.
An economist by training, Ozal was bolder in economic than in political
reforms. Between 1980 and 1982, as deputy prime minister in charge of
economic policy, he brought down inflation from 107 to 25 per cent by
withholding state support from industrialist and consumer alike, allowing
the exchange rate to fall and domestic interest rates to shoot up while
wages lagged behind and uncompetitive firms, including some of the banks,
went bankrupt. At this point he resigned and started quietly building his
own political party, which the generals made the mistake of not taking
seriously until too late: they probably thought he had made himself too
unpopular to matter.
Once in power in his own right, he continued with free-market reforms -
deregulation, lowering of import barriers, abolition of exchange controls,
full convertibility of the lira, and a start on privatisation  - but was
much less rigorous about the money supply. By 1991 inflation was back up at
70 per cent, and though the Turkey enjoyed record growth rates through the
1980s the benefits were far from equally shared. There was a widespread
feeling that the rich in general, and the Ozal family in particular, were
getting much more than their due.
Yet the truth is that nearly all Turks are materially better off now than
they were when Ozal came to power. And he brought the country some less
tangible benefits, too. Having outwitted the military and come to power with
their reluctant blessing, he was less overawed by them than earlier civilian
leaders had been. For the first time in the republic's history, he proved -
by imposing his own choice as head of the armed forces in 1987, and by
ignoring their views during the Gulf crisis in 1990 - that the civil power
can control the military rather than the other way round.
He was not overawed, either, by the towering figure of Ataturk, whose
picture adorns every public building in Turkey. In his last years,
especially, he was quite uninhibited about his public behaviour, whether
observing Islamic rites, indulging his appetite for the good things of life
(including some from which a stricter Moslem would abstain), or simply
saying what he thought. He was a figure with whom ordinary Turkish citizens
could identify, including many of those who were proud to be Kurds, or pious
Moslems, or indeed both. He leaves Turkey not only a richer country, but one
better equipped than it was for living at peace with itself.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (1): Shaking the kaleidoscope - A country
in the throes of change has suddenly been deprived of its leader. Many of
Turgut Ozal's achievements are irreversible, but Turkey still faces daunting
problems with the added danger of political instability. The process of
choosing a new president begins tomorrow.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TURKEY TODAY is a country in the throes of dramatic change, both internal
and external. With the highest growth rate in the Organisation of Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD), it also has inflation running at over
50 per cent.
Its economy has opened decisively to the outside world in the last ten
years, and a full customs union with the EC is scheduled for 1995.
Meanwhile, the strategic environment has been turned upside down by the end
of the cold war, and the country finds itself surrounded by zones of
conflict and instability. Its own south-eastern region has for 8 1/2 years
been the scene of a bitter civil war, which just may now be close to a
peaceful conclusion.
At this decisive moment in its history, the country has been deprived of the
leader who in the last decade did most to shape its destiny. President
Turgut Ozal died on April 17, and parliament votes tomorrow in the first of
four possible ballots to choose his successor. Although for the last year
and a half he has been in office rather than in power, his influence
remained considerable, and his death has shaken the political kaleidoscope.
Ozal was the architect of Turkey's economic recovery and an unflinching
supporter of its traditional pro-western foreign policy.
The emergence of a consumer society, the revival of the search for a
European identity, Turkey's robust support of the US-led coalition against
Iraq: on all these issues Ozal forced Turks to look at themselves and their
country anew.
He also played an important part in the creation of the Black Sea economic
co-operation forum last year, and in encouraging closer links with the
Turkic-speaking central Asian states.
His power to influence policy, uncontested during the Gulf war and its
Kurdish aftermath, had not been the same since the defeat of his Motherland
Party in the November 1991 general election. Yet no Turkish party or
politician can afford to ignore his impact.
The economic reforms he put in place in the early 1980s laid the ground for
Turkey's buoyant return to health after the stop-go performance of the
previous decade. After ten years of growth averaging more than 5 per cent,
Turkish society today is much more open, and Turks themselves more self
assured. The country's membership of the European Community may still be a
distant dream, but the westernising trend continues apace.
President Ozal was criticised for challenging the secular legacy of Mustafa
Kemal Ataturk, the republic's founder. Yet even the social democrats -
political guardians of secularism - are starting to rethink the doctrine of
Kemalism, which was used to justify the military's intervention three times
between 1960 and 1980. Another charge against Ozal was that he gave free
rein to radical Moslem elements. Politicised Islam is certainly a
persistent, if small, force, but there are few politicians who believe it
cannot be contained within Turkey's secular democracy.
On foreign policy, while powerless to prevent the rash of regional
conflicts, Turkey is learning to use its growing diplomatic weight to urge
moderation on both Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Caucasus, and to galvanise
the west to firmer action in Bosnia where Turkish F-16 jets under Nato
command are now helping enforce the UN no-fly zone.
Yet Turkey can ill afford a long period of party bickering. The country has
an urgent agenda ranging from the Kurdish insurgency through relations with
the EC to the economic problems highlighted in a recent OECD report.
A breakthrough in the conflict with Kurdish separatists, seems now to be in
sight, but success is by no means assured. Ankara has yet to frame its
response to the ceasefire declared in March by the Kurdistan Workers' Party
(PKK). The cessation in hostilities provides an opportunity for the
administration to apply its judicial and human rights reforms in the
Kurdish-speaking region, which until now has been largely denied them, owing
to draconian special measures used in the fight against terrorism. A big
economic development package has also been announced, but it remains to be
seen how far the Turkish state will go in allowing the expression of a
distinct Kurdish identity through political parties, or through the use of
the language in schools, broadcasts and administration.
On Europe, too, negotiations are at a turning point as Turkey and the EC
enter the last lap in their progress to acustoms union. By the end of 1995,
if all goes to plan, Turkey should have lifted all import restrictions on EC
goods and adopted the Community's common external tariff. There will almost
certainly be an attempt to link Turkey's reforms with EC concessions on
textile imports, currently limited by a quota arrangement which is
technically in breach of the 1964 Association Agreement.
As the deadline approaches, Turkey's powerful industrial lobbies will no
doubt try to cling on to their privileges. But no government can long
continue to let Turkish industrialists produce high-cost inferior standard
products behind a wall of protective tariffs. Turkish consumers and foreign
investors alike will want a clear signal from Ankara of its commitment to
open the Turkish market. Any slip-up at this first hurdle would deal a
severe blow to Turkey's long term ambitions for full EC membership.
In 1992, the gross domestic product grew by 5.9 per cent - faster than any
other economy in the OECD. But with the population also increasing by 2.1
per cent each year, there is little room for error.
Some progress has been made to close the budget gap, but the underlying
trend of inflation is increasing, and the administration still has to prove
it is serious about tackling the mounting problems of the state enterprises.
As a result, investment has all but stopped.
Challenging enough even to a government with a strong hand on the helm,
Turkey's troubles could suddenly seem insurmountable if a period of
political drift sets in.
By itself, President Ozal's death would have been sufficient to stimulate a
bout of national introspection. But when it emerged that his great rival,
prime minister Suleyman Demirel, was likely to stand as a presidential
candidate, the way ahead was suddenly clouded with uncertainty. For while
Demirel could be reasonably confident of success, the succession to him as
leader of the True Path Party (DYP - the largest in the present parliament)
is much less obvious. The leader of that party would certainly be asked to
form the next government, but it is by no means certain that the present
coalition of DYP and social democrats will continue. And should parliament
by any chance fail to elect a new head of state, after four ballots it would
be automatically dissolved and the country plunged immediately into a
general election.
The politicians may yet see themselves through the morass. A smooth handover
would provide the best guarantee of the durability of the political and
economic reforms set in motion by the late president. But elections for the
presidency are always fraught in Turkey, even though it is a largely
ceremonial post. This time will provide a thorough test of the maturity of
the political system, and any further political and economic reforms must
remain in doubt as long as the threat of early election hangs over the
parliament.
The promised land is still some way off. Whatever administration emerges,
the challenges confronting Turkey remain awesome. But there can now be no
turning back from the road on which Turgut Ozal struck out.

FT  07 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains lost as the sellers
return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEAKNESS in the gilt-edged market following the announcement of the latest
domestic money supply statistics undermined an attempted rally in the UK
stock market yesterday. The FT-SE 2,800 mark was regained and then lost, and
the market closed a further 10 Footsie points off, with traders nervous that
today, the last day of the extended May Day equity trading account, will be
overshadowed by the outcome of the UK local elections and an important
parliamentary by-election held yesterday.
Although the picture was brightened by good trading figures from British
Petroleum, there was some selling across the range of the equity market.
Seaq volume increased by around 26 per cent over Wednesday's levels, with
the blue chips and the second line stocks sharing the pain in the second
half of the session.
In early trading the FT-SE gained 9.5 to clear the 2,800 hurdle with
comfort. Equities were helped by an initially better tone in stock index
futures, and by the favourable response to BP's first quarter results.
However, the euphoria soon wore off and, although the immediate reaction to
the absence of any change in interest rate policy at the Bundesbank policy
meeting was mild, the June future on the the FT-SE Index came under
pressure.
Equities also took the news that UK money supply M0, the narrow measure, had
risen by 4.8 per cent in the year to April without great surprise. But as
government bonds extended losses to around a full point, the stock market
fell away.
At worst, the Footsie was 12.6 lower and a late rally, encouraged by a slow
opening to the new Wall Street session trimmed the loss only slightly. The
final reading on the FT-SE Index of 2,786.3, down 10.2, left the market
right at the lower end of its trading range. Seaq volume increased to 681.5m
shares from Wednesday's 539.1m, which reflected retail business worth Pounds
1.05bn. Trading volume has remained high as the market has given ground over
the past two trading sessions.
Traders entertained few hopes of any significant change in market sentiment
before the equity trading account closes tonight. The three week account,
extended to cover the May Day break, has proved a wearying experience, and
government popularity will be tested today by the local and by-election
results.
There has been growing belief that the stock market might have already
discounted much of the economic recovery now acclaimed in political circles,
and that a genuine recovery in corporate profits and dividends might take
some time to develop.
A further check to confidence has come this week with the re-appearance of
rights issue pressures, in the form of Wednesday's Pounds 404m cash call
from Royal Insurance. Institutional cash balances are known to be small
because of heavy commitments ahead of the Government's bond funding
programme, as well as pending equity calls from BT III and ICI/Zeneca.
Falls in government bonds yesterday reinforced concern over the pressure
which could be imposed on the markets by government's monthly funding
programme. The threat of higher yields in the gilt-edged market has acted as
a check to confidence in equities.

FT  07 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Grand Met firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Big turnover in Grand Metropolitan ahead of interim results next week
increased speculation that the stock may have turned the corner following
the shares' recent poor run. They have underperformed the market by 8 per
cent in the last quarter, weakened by sentiment over branded goods,
uncertainty over a US drinks tax, and the decline in the dollar. Around half
of group profits are earned in the US currency.
Yesterday, SGST became the latest broker to turn positive on the stock,
citing economic recovery in the US and UK and the shares low rating. NatWest
Securities, BZW and Kleinwort Benson were also pointing out the stock's
potential upside. Mr Geoff Collyer at NatWest said Grand Met was the only
group in the drinks sector likely to show earnings growth this year, yet was
on the lowest rating. In a weak drinks sector, the shares rose 8 to 423p in
turnover of 7.1m.
Additional speculative support was leant in the morning session as Grand Met
became the latest name to be linked with United Biscuits. Shares in the food
manufacturer, which has been the subject of intense takeover activity in
recent weeks, jumped sharply but faded to close a penny ahead at 421p.
More takeover talk in the drinks sector was rekindled in old favourites
Boddington and Devenish. Boddington was rumoured to be casting its eye on
the brewing group it failed to capture in June 1991 but in which it retains
a 19.1 per cent stake. Boddington then bid 210p-a-share, and yesterday
Devenish closed steady at 300p, leading drinks specialists to suggest a
350p-a-share fresh bid which would be required was too expensive and out of
Boddington's reach. Its shares finished 3 ahead at 271p.
Vodafone continued to outperform the telecoms sector, the shares racing up
13 1/2 to 393 1/2 p, after 397p and threatening the 400p barrier according
to dealers, as the market continued to assess the impressive new subscriber
figures for April - the highest for three years. Turnover,in Vodafone was
10m shares, the heaviest single-day's trade for almost a year.
A series of profits upgrades in now being predicted after the group
announces what are expected to be good figures on June 8.
Mr Patrick Wellington at NatWest Securities said Vodafone was 'On the cusp
of a significant turn in the business, demonstrating the qualities of a
growth cyclical.'
Clyde Petroleum edged up 1 1/2 to 50p and were apparently unaffected by a
bought deal executed by the company's stockbroker Hoare Govett. Two blocks
of shares, one of 9.9m and another of 1.3m, the equivalent of a 3.5 per cent
stake, were bought by the broker at 50p and placed with institutions at 50
1/4 p. Turnover in Clyde totalled 25m shares.
The identity of the seller was not known in the market but Clyde has a
number of big institutional shareholders notably Norwich Union, George
Weston Holdings, Schroders and the Prudential. British Coal Pension Fund and
Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management each hold stakes of below 5 per cent.
There was continued poor sentiment towards Ladbroke Group, the shares
sliding a further 3 to 157p. As well as well worn worries over debts
upsetting some, dealers are said to be concerned that next month's cash
alternative to the dividend, being offered by the group's joint brokers,
will mean that a lot of stock may need to be placed. NatWest Securities was
one broker taking a more positive longer-term view yesterday, however,
focusing on the group's betting business potential.
Hotel group Forte slipped a penny to 192p, with Nomura turning positive on
the stock. There was a rumour that the group has been in discussions to sell
its Harvester pub division. Drugs group Boots weakened as it announced it
was slashing suncare products in reaction to similar moves from its
competitors last week. The shares fell 10 to 336p and raised fears that
Boots profitable OTC business could be threatened.
Automotive engineering group GKN saw its shares tumble 13 to 461p ahead of
the annual meeting on May 19 and talk of a forecast downgrading. Analysts
said Credit Lyonnais Laing reiterated its sell stance and cut profit
forecasts by Pounds 15m to Pounds 120m for 1993 and by Pounds 20m to Pounds
153m for 1994.
ICI drifted 5 1/2 to 1259p in spite of confirmation by the London Stock
Exchange that dealings in the unofficial 'grey' market in new ICI shares and
those of the bioscience arm Zeneca will start again on May 12.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News and electronic information group Reuters Holdings which announced
yesterday that it is to move its main operational site saw a two-way tussle
develop in the shares.
Agency broker James Capel has been telling clients about the group's
marketing ploy to boost sales of its Dealing 2000-2 automated foreign
exchange trading system. It says that take-up of the system has been 'so
disappointing' that the company has been forced to offer discount incentives
to users.
However, Henderson Crosthwaite, traditionally an enthusiastic supporter of
the company, said yesterday that Reuters recent poor share price performance
had pushed the historic p/e relative to its lowest level since the shares
were listed in 1984. Analyst Mr Brian Newman believes that prospects for
Reuters three new transaction systems are impressive and has the stock as a
strong buy. Yesterday the shares rose 18 at best before being sold back down
again to close a net 14 better at 1258p.

FT  07 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: US buys Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome recovered 19 to 747p on the back of a rush of
US buying. The overseas interest was prompted by a shift of stance by US
investment bank Morgan Stanley.
The house pharmaceuticals analyst Mr Duncan Moore said that following
presentations in London and New York 'the risk in breaking mid-teens growth
rate is less and there is more potential for upside surprise'
He said that he had an 18-month share price target of Dollars 15 (970p) to
Dollars 18 and felt the shares had been 'horribly oversold'. Finally, there
was a bounce as dealers appreciated that worries over a rival drug to
Wellcome's azt anti-Aids treatment were overdone.

FT  07 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: BP basks in market approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MUCH BETTER first quarter figures than expected from British Petroleum
vindicated the aggressively bullish stance on the shares adopted by most US
and some UK brokers in the wake of the UK oil company decision last year to
chop its dividend and jettison its chairman. BP shares were the second best
individual performer in the FT-SE 100 index, rising around 3.4 per cent.
Historic cost net income of Pounds 325m, well above a general consensus of
forecasts around the Pounds 200m mark, and replacement cost net income of
Pounds 231m, against forecasts of around Pounds 220m, prompted a surge of
buying interest from UK and overseas brokers.
At the close BP shares were 10 higher at 306p, with turnover reaching a
healthy 9.1m shares.
Long term bears of the stock, however, while acknowledging the good results,
continued to point to the group's fundamental problems. Mr John Toalster at
SGST said he would upgrade his current year forecasts for the company but
maintained that the group was 'still shrinking, offered a mediocre return on
capital employed and remained highly geared; switch into Shell.'
Other analysts, although impressed by the latest profits, pointed to the
company's cash flow position. The first quarter saw cash inflow of Pounds
600m but only after the sale of Pounds 675m worth of assets; 'the group is
still leaking cash, and the figures were embellished by a write back of
petroleum revenue tax.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DERIVATIVES markets continued weak with dealers having little of
significance to focus on, writes Christopher Price.
The June FT-SE 100 contract opened fairly firmly at 2,800, lifted by
positive overnight sentiment from Wall Street. Wellcome had been in demand,
stimulating the other drugs stocks and a consequent fillip when London
opened. The figures from oil group BP were also said to have struck a
positive note.
However, the surge proved to be short-lived and June soon ran into sellers.
It then began a slow drift downwards, punctuated by the odd bout of good
two-way business, but eventually succumbing to the mildly negative tone in
the market.
Dealers say that with little corporate activity to focus on, the short-term
was being dictated by the feeling that the equity market was oversold and
was now in a period of correction.
A lacklustre Wall Street failed to inspire any hint of a rally in the early
afternoon and June closed at 2,783, 13 down on the previous session and
around 4 points below its approximate fair value level of 7. Volume was
slightly down on the previous day at 7,595 contracts.
In stock options, BTR topped the list with 2,297 contracts traded. TSB
followed on 1,549, then Lonrho on 1,525 and Eastern Electricity on 1,032
contracts.

FT  07 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks drift ahead of
April jobs report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCKS continued to drift in narrow price ranges as investors traded
cautiously ahead of today's important jobs report for April, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 7.20 at 3,441.90,
having spent the day no more than a few points off Wednesday's close. The
more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 1.26 lower at 443.26, while the
Amex composite finished up 1.06 at 426.95, and the Nasdaq composite down
3.22 at 680.04. Trading volume on the NYSE was 152m shares, and rises and
declines were running almost neck and neck at 940 to 933, respectively.
Trading was fairly subdued throughout the day, with many investors choosing
to stay on the sidelines until today's release of the April employment
report, which should give the best indication yet of how the labour market
has responded to the recent slowdown in economic growth.
At other times, yesterday's weekly unemployment claims data might have moved
prices, but the fact that the figures came in unchanged for the final
working week of April left the markets unmoved.
There was no lead for equities from the bond market, which was still trying
to digest the implications of Wednesday's announcement of the Treasury's
changes to its debt mix, which will involve cutting the number of long bonds
issued and increasing sales of shorter-dated securities.
Retailers were actively traded and mixed in the wake of April sales figures.
Woolworth fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 29 3/8 after reporting a fall in same
store sales for last month. Stocks buoyed by solid figures included JC
Penney up Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 43 3/8 , May Department Stores, up Dollars
1 at Dollars 73 7/8 , and Carter Hawley Hale, up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 13
5/8 .
Dayton Hudson fell more than Dollars 2 in early trading after the company
said that sluggish April sales would mean its first quarter earnings will
come in lower than a year ago, but recovered later to end up Dollars  3/8 at
Dollars 70.
Forest product stocks, which have been hit by concerns about the impact on
earnings of falling wood prices, ran into further selling.
Louisiana-Pacific, fell Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 61 3/8 , while Weyerhauser
dropped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 42 5/8 .
Storage Technology firmed Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 34 7/8 in volume of 1.3m
shares after analysts at Wall Street investment bank Lehman Brothers raised
their rating on the stock from 'neutral' to 'buy'.
On the Nasdaq market, Rochester Savings climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 18
7/8 after the company received a takeover offer. First Empire and KeyCorp
are believed to be among the possible suitors.
Canada
TORONTO STOCK prices closed mixed in extremely heavy trading.
According to preliminary data, the TSE-300 composite index rose 5.85 points

The gold group recorded the day's biggest gain , up 1.8 per cent, as the
price of gold in New York rose USDollars 2.70 to USDollars 356.95 an ounce.

FT  07 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Maastricht optimism lifts Danish
equities - But will the rally be sustained after the referendum on May 18
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Falling interest rates and an increasing likelihood that the electorate will
approve the Maastricht treaty on May 18 in Denmark's second referendum on
this issue have brought joy back to the equity market.
The all-share index is up by 16.9 per cent this year and 4.0 per cent over
the past week. The KFX index is at its highest since last July, closing
yesterday at 87.85.
The opinion polls indicate that the referendum will show a 60-40 split in
favour of the treaty, which was narrowly rejected in last summer's
referendum.
The question is whether the result has by now been largely discounted by the
markets. Mr Lau Svenssen, of Copenhagen brokers Fibroco, believes that the
market will rise by another 10-15 per cent by the end of the year in the
event of a 'yes' vote, a judgment which is fairly widely shared.
However, the economic picture is not wholly reassuring. The krone,
participating in the ERM, has appreciated by about 7 per cent over the past
year as the UK, Swedish, Finnish and Italian currencies have depreciated.
This appreciation is putting pressure on profits and order books in export
industries, and the recession in Germany, which accounts for about a third
of Denmark's exports of manufactured goods, is additional bad news.
Furthermore, preliminary estimates of exports in the early months of the
year by the Bureau of Statistics in Copenhagen point to a 10 per cent fall
in the value of exports.
The big Danish banks and the Federation of Danish Industries agree that
there will be little or no increase in GDP this year.
Inflation is low, 1.3 per cent over the 12 months to March, but unemployment
is now 12 per cent.
Among the immediate beneficiaries of falling interest rates are the banks.
Realised and unrealised gains (or losses) on the value of their bond and
share portfolios between the first and last days of the accounting year go
straight into the profit and loss account.
Unless there is a set-back later in the year, this factor alone should mean
that the larger banks, which were heavily in the red in 1992, will have a
happier year. Den Danske Bank's share price so far this year has risen 37
per cent to DKr327 and Unibank's by 50 per cent to DKr185.
The A. P. Moller shipping and oil and gas group's listed companies, D/S 1912
and D/S Svendborg, have risen by 26 per cent, after performing better than
most of its international competitors in 1992.
However, the other big shipping group, Lauritzen, has slipped by 16 per
cent. The EC's decision restricting imports of South American bananas may
have had an adverse impact on Lauritzen's refrigerated cargo vessels as well
as its shipyard, which has specialised in building large 'reefer' vessels
for the fruit trade.
The year's disaster is Baltica Holding (which is changing its name to
Gefion). It was the holding company for the Baltica insurance companies
until a reorganisation, backed by Den Danske Bank, took place in March, when
Baltica Holding was reduced to being a minority shareholder.
Baltica Holding's share price has been halved to DKr89, which is DKr12 under
par, so far this year.
An attack on Baltica by its main domestic rival, Hafnia Holding, in 1990-91
was a factor in Baltica Holding's collapse.
Hafnia Holding itself collapsed last year when the Hafnia insurance
companies were sold to Codan, the Danish company controlled by the UK's Sun
Alliance, in March.
Investors apparently approve, with Codan's share price currently 18 per cent
up this year.
Among the larger industrials, Danisco, the sugar, distilleries and packaging
group, has risen by 36 per cent, GN Great Northern, electro-technical and
telecommunications, by 29 per cent, while Carlsberg, the breweries group,
and Novo Nordisk, pharmaceuticals and enzymes, and FLS Industries,
engineering, have performed more modestly, all putting on just under 7 per
cent this year.
The East Asiatic Company, the large trading group, was forced by financial
difficulties to sell its Europe-Far East container shipping line to A. P.
Moller this spring, since when its share price has recovered from a low of
DKr52 to Dkr95, which is still DKr5 below par.

FT  07 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo loses 1.4% in
first session after holiday break

LATE program sales pushed equity prices near intraday lows amid choppy
trading and active volume after the Golden Week holiday, writes Wayne Aponte
in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed down 297.15, or 1.4 per cent, at 20,622.03, after
trading between 20,611.48 and 20,941.97. The Topix Index of all first
section issues ended 9.46 lower at 1,611,33 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei
50 index rose 2.49 to 1,269.01.
Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was estimated at
600m shares, compared to Friday's 699m. The market was closed between Monday
and Wednesday. Advancers ahead of decliners at 594 to 480, with 111 issues
unchanged.
Brokers said that market sentiment remains bullish in spite of the day's
declines, regarded largely as a natural correction to the 6.7 per cent gains
of last week. One analyst at a UK brokerage said that some domestic
institutional investors await further stability in the yen's movement
against the dollar before committing new capital into the stock market.
Market participants added that the session's turnover was slightly
exaggerated because brokers executed some cross trades.
Profit-taking pushed Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Y23,000 lower to
Y961,000.
Large capitalisation issues in the iron and steel sector lost ground. Nippon
Steel dropped Y12 to Y402, Kawasaki Steel Y3 to Y374 and Sumitomo Metal
Industries Y10 to Y350.
Investors took profits on heavy electric issues. Hitachi retreated Y24 to
Y913, Toshiba Y22 to Y752 and Mitsubishi Electric Y9 to Y620.
But foreign market participants pushed up the shipbuilding sector.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industies rose Y8 to Y717, Mitsui Engineering and
Shipbuilding Y3 to Y460 and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Y12 to
Y523.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 36.21 higher at 22,664.29, in volume of
32.9m shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets were mixed. Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore were
closed.
AUSTRALIA surged as investors bought banking issues and gold stocks
continued strong, on expectations of a higher bullion price. The All
Ordinaries closed 17.2 ahead at 1,691.9. in turnover of ADollars 391.9m.
Westpac rose 12 cents to ADollars 3.62 in volume of 8.43m shares with US
pension funds said to be active buyers on the view that the banking sector
is undervalued.
TAIWAN stocks ended higher and turnover rose on hopes that the central bank
would ease monetary policy, though late profit-taking reduced gains. The
weighted index, which was up more than 80 points at one stage, finished
43.16 higher at 4,492.48.
SEOUL fell 1.2 per cent on a wave of selling that flooded the market after
the composite index breached the 720 level.
The index closed with a loss of 9.03 at 710.80, although turnover was a
relatively thin Won397.27m.
BANGKOK returned to work after Wednesday's holiday and shares rebounded as
institutions bought bank, finance and construction-material stocks. The SET
index rose 17.03 or 2.1 per cent to 845.13 in thin turnover of Bt3.24bn.
Prices had been falling sharply since last week amid allegations of share
price manipulation. But at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, a deputy minister
who had sparked the latest rush of allegations, agreed to stop talking about
the issue.
HONG KONG lost ground as local investors shifted funds from blue chips to
second and third tier issues. The Hang Seng index declined 33.81 to 6,795.52
as foreign fund managers refrained from building new positions on blue chip
issues. Turnover remained almost flat at HKDollars 4.6bn against HKDollars
4.5bn. Traders said that some institutions were switching to other Asian
equity markets ahead of the Sino-British talks on May 21.
MANILA eased on profit-taking after hitting a record high on Wednesday. The
composite index fell 10.89 to 1,643.50, sliding from the day's high in the
morning. Turnover fell to 489.5m pesos.
NEW ZEALAND closed almost flat on low turnover, as cautiousness set in. The
NZSE-40 index edged up 1.54 to 1,579.09.

FT  07 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Interest rate cut fails to
inspire Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE cut interest rates but Germany did not, while the likelihood that war
in the Balkans may involve other European countries kept sentiment depressed
yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS shrugged off the cut in domestic interest rates, the fifth in a month,
either because they were not enough or because, having been signalled in
advance, they had already been discounted. The CAC-40 index closed 5.85
lower at 1,920.49. Turnover was moderate at FFr2.1bn.
Mr Andrew Shepherd-Barron of Kleinwort Benson in London noted that further
rate cuts were necessary in the short-term in order to counterbalance the
usual seasonal torpor of the market. However, with three month money rates
only marginally ahead of German rates the next move had to come from the
direction of the Bundesbank, he said.
Michelin was among the day's risers, up FFr6.20 or 4 per cent at FFr149.00.
Having fallen 25 per cent since mid-January some bargain hunting is evident
although the stock is also interest rate sensitive.
FRANKFURT was marginally higher as earlier gains were eroded by weak
corporate earnings announcements. Disappointment over the Bundesbank's
decision to keep interest rates unchanged also set in, the DAX index closing
up 0.1 at 1,623.26. Turnover fell to DM5.3bn from DM6.2bn.
An announcement by Hochtief, down DM28 to DM1,102, that full year earnings
would probably remain flat, contrary to expectations of higher earnings,
depressed confidence. Mannesmann was among the bright spots of the day,
rising DM2.30 to DM251.50, after announcing a cut in its 1992 dividend to
DM6 per share from DM9. Mr Patrick Shields at NatWest Securities said
investors had expected the dividend to fall as low as DM2, and were
encouraged by the group's firm profit outlook in its cellular telephone
division.
MILAN marked time, ignoring Moody's decision to cut Italy's foreign debt
rating, and concentrating instead on Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's
speech to parliament, outlining his economic programme.
The Comit index eased 0.79 to 540.76, with investors also awaiting the first
of the parliamentary confidence votes, scheduled for this evening.
Mr Nicolo Braendli of Akros Sim in Milan said that Mr Ciampi's programme was
well received by the market, although he noted that the government faced no
easy task in achieving its economic goals and introducing electoral reform.
Sme rose L93 to L6,438 in reaction to plans announced on Wednesday for the
sale of its retail unit. Credito Italiano added L41 to L2,977 while Gemina,
the financial holding company, rose L30 to L1,340, before easing to L1,335
after hours, on rumours that it had put together a group of investors to buy
a large stake in Credito.
Generali, down L105 at the settlement L37,790, picked up to L38,300 on the
kerb on rumours that the board might be about to propose a bonus issue.
Montedison dipped L23 to L1,177 as the local press reported a recent market
rumour that it might be incorporated into Ferruzzi, which traded L16 lower
to L1,141.
ZURICH made a positive start in reaction to the continuing strength of the
franc against the D-Mark and on speculation of cuts in Swiss and German
interest rates. But in the absence of any move on rates the SMI index
finished 1.3 easier at 2,165.4.
SMH the watchmaker spent a volatile day, adding SFr55 in early trading
before slipping back to finish a net SFr10 lower at SFr1,830 in response to
Wednesday's plans to split its shares and convert certificates into bearers
and registered shares.
STOCKHOLM continued to rally with prices rising to a new year's high in
active trading led by further strength in S-E Banken. The Affarsvarlden
index rose 6.9 to 1,059 in turnover of SKr1.8bn. S-E Banken's C shares
advanced SKr5 to SKr27.
The index has risen 16 per cent from the start of the year and traders said
that some investors have started to become cautious over the rapid rise.
Companies are expected to announce interim profits over the next few weeks,
and Mr Henrik Breum, analyst at Unibors Securities, said that weaker than
expected earnings could prompt profit-taking, taking the index to the 1,000
level in the near term.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Mark staunches its losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK yesterday staunched some of the losses it has sustained against
other European currencies in recent days after the Bundesbank caused slight
disappointment by leaving its official interest rates unchanged, writes
James Blitz.
Earlier this week, dealers reported that investors had been switching funds
out of the D-Mark and into other European currencies amid signs that the
Bundesbank was easing monetary policy at a faster pace.
However, the Bundesbank's decision to leave both its Lombard and discount
rates unchanged coincided with a slight weakening of the Swiss franc.
After closing at SFr0.897 to the D-Mark on Wednesday night, the 'Swissie'
fell back to the SFr0.90 level yesterday. But the Swiss currency still
closed slightly stronger on the day at SFr0.895.
The Bank of France's decision to cut its two main interest rates by 25 basis
points also weakened the French franc slightly. The reduction of the
intervention and 5-10 day lending rates to 8.0 per cent and 9.0 per cent
respectively was rather greater than the Bundesbank's cut in its repo rate
earlier this week.
Despite falling back earlier in the day, the French franc still closed at
FFr3.370 to the D-Mark from a previous FFr3.372.
The dollar was confined to tight ranges against the D-Mark as the market
awaited today's non-farm payroll figure for April. Following the
poorer-than-expected figure from the National Association of Purchasing
Managers earlier this week, the market has revised down its expectations for
today's headline figure from +160,000 to +130,000.
The dollar yesterday closed more or less unchanged at DM1.5790.
Sterling slipped against the D-Mark following news that the Bundesbank had
left policy unchanged and that money supply growth in April had been lower
than expected. However, the pound was generally stronger on the day as a
technical rebound followed the selling of Tuesday and Wednesday. The
currency closed at DM2.4800 from a previous DM2.4750.
There are differing views over whether the pound will head up or down from
here, partly because of uncertainty over the direction of UK base rates.
Mr Gavyn Davies, Managing Director of Goldman Sachs International, said
yesterday that the UK authorities could raise interest rates if the sterling
exchange rate index, which measures the pound against a basket of
currencies, dropped to around 75.0 or 77.0 from last night's close of 80.7.
However, he said that the sterling exchange rate would have to move even
more substantially in an upward direction to warrant a cut in UK rates. In
his view the ERI would have to register around 87.0 to 89.0 for this to be
possible.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Money Markets: France cuts rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of France yesterday fulfilled market expectations by cutting its
official interest rates once again, but dealers took the view that this
would be the last easing for several months, writes James Blitz.
As expected, the Bank of France cut both its intervention rate and its 5-10
day lending rate by 25 basis points to 8.00 per cent and 9.00 per cent
respectively.
The move came at the end of several weeks in which the French franc has
performed extremely strongly inside the exchange rate mechanism, bringing
French franc money market rates close to those for the D-Mark.
However, the market's response appeared to be in the tradition of 'buying
the rumour and selling the facts' and cash rates rose again. The
Bundesbank's decision not to change monetary policy at its fortnightly
meeting was also the source of some disappointment.
The June French franc contract closed down 14 basis points on the day at
92.48, while the September contract was 11 basis points down on the day at
93.18. Three month French cash drifted down during the day, closing at
around 7.50 per cent - the same level indicated by the June future.
The disappointment in German markets was partly due to the surprisingly
tight conditions there this week. The Bundesbank's net drain of DM2.4bn from
the market on Wednesday came as dealers were clearly finding themselves
short of funds.
Borrowings through the most expensive Bundesbank window, the Lombard rate,
have already amounted to more than DM3bn this week, a far larger sum than
normal. German call money yesterday remained firm at about 7.78 per cent.
Sterling futures reflected some of the disappointment felt over the
Bundesbank's unchanged policy, and the June contract was down 6 basis points
at one stage yesterday at 93.90. However, the contract later recovered to
close at 93.95.
Once again, this was the same close as that for the September contract.
Three month sterling cash fell about  1/16 per cent to close at 5 15/16 per
cent. The easy removal of a Pounds 1.25bn shortage again helped to bring
down short-dated rates in the interbank market.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Canadian Forest Products (11): Tough market limits
scope of recovery - Robert Gibbens considers the prospects for the country's
newsprint mills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S newsprint mills face a volatile recovery now that the 1990-92 North
American recession finally appears to be over.
The biggest talking point at the moment is whether a 5-7 per cent reduction
in discounts posted in North America in April will hold and whether
resurgent demand on the east coast will justify a further attempt to impose
higher prices later in 1993.
West of the Rockies, newsprint prices have been stuck around USDollars 400 a
tonne because of California's depressed economy. The price could rise to
USDollars 435 by summer, but a real upturn in demand is far off, warns Mr
Robert Findlay, president of MacMillan Bloedel, one of two big Canadian
companies in that market.
'We see a very slow pick-up and it'll take time to make the April increase
stick. I'm very cautious about the outlook.' He adds that eastern
advertising was weak in the first quarter, but is improving.
According to Mr Paul Gagne, president of Canadian Pacific Forest Products,
over-optimism is dangerous. 'Demand is there but it's a mighty tough market.
Delivered cost rules supreme. I don't see real benefits from a better
pricing environment till the second half and 1994.'
Some publishers have been buying for their inventories because of firming
prices and the risk of mill stoppages in eastern Canada. Labour contracts
expired on April 30 and the Canadian Paperworkers Union has named
Abitibi-Price as its 'target' company. Western contracts expire this summer.
The newsprint and groundwood specialty mills - preponderantly in the east -
expect to operate at an average 93 per cent of capacity this year and 94 per
cent in 1994, against 85 per cent at the recession's trough. Some are
working flat out now, and see operating rates reaching 96 per cent next
year.
Analysts predict average 1993 newsprint prices in the east at USDollars 485
a tonne and USDollars 540 in 1994, and most companies accept those numbers
based on average annual North American market growth of 2-3 per cent.
Little new tonnage is in sight. Since 1989, 34 old machines with 1.8m tonnes
of capacity have been shut in North America and 12 new ones, totalling 2m
tonnes, have come on stream.
Sustained transaction prices of USDollars 600 or more are needed to justify
financing further capacity, and that point may not be reached before
1995-97, or near the cyclical peak.
'Such levels are possible but we'd still be below the official list price,'
says Mr Terry Pendleton, Kruger's vice-president, newsprint sales. But he
adds: 'We've really turned the corner. My order book is the strongest in
five years, and tightness in supply may well develop.'
The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association in January estimated 1993 newsprint
shipments would rise 2.8 per cent to 9.4m tonnes. Strength in the US and
Pacific Rim would offset lower European demand.
The industry is well advanced in installing recycled pulp capacity to meet
US regulations and maintain US newsprint market share, but the west coast's
single 120,000-tonne de-inking plant is not enough.
Mr Frank Dottori, president of Tembec, a big pulp and cartonboard producer
which has moved into newsprint by taking 40 per cent of Spruce Falls, says:
'We can meet the global challenge if we can raise capital with the
equivalent of US tax-free industrial revenue bonds. We've cut operating
costs and won job flexibility, but the government still ties our hands.'
Canadian newsprint traditionally takes well over 50 per cent of the US
market and Europe is still very important, he points out. Many mills are
owned by foreign publishers.
But technology, the rise of the US south, and inflated domestic costs have
changed the equation. Canada's share of the US market, now about 12m tonnes
a year, is slipping below 50 per cent and some see further shrinkage.
The US doubled its newsprint capacity to nearly 7m tonnes from 1972 to 1992,
though the south and the west face rising fibre costs.
'We must develop the Pacific Rim markets where growth will be double-digit
in the next few years,' says Mr Keith Winrow, vice-president, finance of
Fletcher Challenge Canada.
'Canadian newsprint will see a shift in geographical base as companies plan
more investment in the US. Canada has the fibre, but our main market is in
another jurisdiction. We're highly capital-intensive and we face a volatile
economic cycle.'
Reports persist of efforts to merge two or more Canadian firms into a
globally- competitive 'super-news' group. 'The idea has logic but the spark
is missing,' says Mr Dottori. 'I see only regional shuffles of assets to
gain fibre resource and cost advantages.'

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Canadian Forest Products (12): How the paper mill
was saved - Theresa Byrne on the new corporate culture at Spruce Falls,
Ontario
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By THERESA BYRNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When workers struck a deal to buy the Spruce Falls paper mill at
Kapuskasing, Ontario, in late 1991, the whole town felt it had been granted
a reprieve.
'The euphoria of just having avoided death, so to speak, was running through
the air,' says Mr Denis Turcotte, vice-president and general manager of mill
operations.
Mr Turcotte led the group of employees which now owns 52 per cent of the
mill, located about 800km north of Toronto.
The story is a microcosm of the pressures felt in recent years by companies
and workers in the Canadian forestry industry. It illustrates the sacrifices
and changes in corporate culture required to maintain a competitive footing.
The drive to save Spruce Falls began when the previous owners of the mill,
Kimberly-Clark and the New York Times, decided to cut their exposure in the
Canadian newsprint industry. The two US companies offered to hand over the
mill to the employees, contingent on the sale of a nearby hydro-electric
generating plant to Ontario Hydro.
Without an agreement, the owners warned, they would shut three of the mill's
four newsprint machines, putting 1,200 people out of work.
After months of tense negotiations, which at times hovered on the brink of
failure, Spruce Falls Acquisition Corp bought the mill for one dollar in
December 1991. 'It was a long, drawn-out courtship,' says Mr Norman
Leybourne, leader of the coalition of the five local trade union branches
which represent the workers. 'We had many arguments.'
Under the deal, the employees own 52 per cent of the operating company,
known as Spruce Falls Inc. Another 7 per cent is held by residents of
Kapuskasing (population 10,000) and surrounding communities.
Tembec, a major Canadian pulp and paper producer which has its origins in an
employee buy-out of a Quebec newsprint mill, acquired a 41 per cent stake in
Spruce Falls. Tembec resisted efforts to turn Spruce Falls into a
co-operative and its president, Mr Frank Dottori, took over as chief
executive of Spruce Falls.
Ontario Hydro bought the Spruce Falls power plant. In what has become a
sensitive issue, the mill will get free power for 10 years plus a CDollars
34m non-interest bearing loan. Mr John Johnson, forestry analyst with
Richardson Greenshields, defends the package, saying: 'It's not like a
government subsidy. It was part of the deal.'
Mr Leybourne says that the new company's goal is to 'modernise and grow,
with real permanent jobs. It's not just to survive.'
The cornerstone of its strategy is a CDollars 300m modernisation programme
due to be completed by 1994. A CDollars 100m thermo-mechanical pulp line is
expected to be fully operational by the end of August. This facility will
boost TMP capacity by 500 tonnes a day, to 825 tonnes. The cost will be well
below the CDollars 130m originally projected, largely due to Tembec's
expertise in building such plants, says Mr Turcotte.
The new pulp line will enable Spruce Falls to supply a wider variety of
products, including brighter, bleached paper.
Further diversification will come from a CDollars 20-25m sawmill now in the
planning stages. Marketing operations, too, have been upgraded. In the old
days, the sales department was isolated from production. 'Every problem that
they had was our fault,' says Mr Leybourne, the union leader.
Spruce Falls' marketing and sales office is still based in Toronto. But
co-ordination with the mill has been improved by moving the order entry
system to Kapuskasing.
At the same time, managers and workers are having to adjust to a new
corporate culture which emphasises consultation.
'This is a merging of capitalism and socialism,' says Mr Leybourne. 'The
system that we had up until now has been a reactionary, master-slave
relationship.'
The workforce has shrunk to about 800 from 1,400 in mid-1991, although the
pain of lay-offs has been alleviated by offering some workers temporary
construction jobs on the new pulp line.
Greater flexibility and a higher level of productivity are being demanded
from the employees who remain. Mr Turcotte cites the example of repairs to a
small pump. In the Kimberly-Clark days, union rules required up to 10 people
to do the job. Now, only a millwright and a pipe-fitter are deployed.
Participation by all levels in decision-making and problem-solving is a
cornerstone of the new corporate philosophy. Disciplinary hearings have been
speeded up, and disciplinary committees are now composed of both union and
management representatives.
'I think one major risk is that, as a company, we do not successfully
complete this cultural change we're looking for,' says Mr Turcotte.
Spruce Falls has been profitable since the employee buy-out. Net income for
the 10 months ended September 30 1992 was CDollars 4.5m on sales of CDollars
94.6m. For the three months to December 31 1992, the company reported
earnings of CDollars 2.5m on sales of CDollars 31.6m.
The new owners say they are taking a more aggressive approach than
Kimberly-Clark to environmental concerns.
In an effort to protect fish habitat, this summer marks the last that the
Kapuskasing River, which borders the mill, will be used to transport logs.
In addition, the company has started to build a CDollars 38m secondary
effluent treatment facility, which is due be operational by summer 1994.
An investment of CDollars 2.5m in the newspaper de-inking and recycling
plant last year means that newsprint is now produced with up to 15 per cent
recycled content. Additional spending of CDollars 7m in 1993 will increase
the average recycled content to 25 per cent.
In the short term, the continuing over-supply of newsprint in North America
remains a worry. But given reduced production costs at Kapuskasing, Mr
Turcotte predicts that low prices would force 90 per cent of other mills out
of business ahead of Spruce Falls.
The company hopes to benefit in the long run from its advanced technology
and proximity to high-quality black spruce and aspen forests. In words
echoed by many other forestry executives, Mr Leybourne says: 'If you don't
change, you die.'

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Canadian Forest Products (10): Waiting for a late
bloomer - Profile / Domtar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW big forest products firms have been mauled more severely by the
three-year recession than Domtar.
Hopes for higher prices for its communications, speciality fine papers,
newsprint and groundwood (magazine) papers were kindled in vain in 1991 and
again in 1992. The recession and oversupply quickly nipped recovery in the
bud.
Domtar, based in Montreal, maintained volume and its US market share in
paper products, but had to continue a heavy investment programme to raise
efficiency at its mills. Assets were sold or shuffled and manpower cut by
several thousand as losses mounted.
The crisis would have been worse without backing from the Quebec government
for a restructuring. Domtar is 44 per cent-owned by two Quebec government
agencies, including the Dollars 41bn Caisse de Depot, which invests public
sector pension funds.
But now Domtar sees light at the end of the tunnel, says Mr Pierre
Desjardins, president and chief executive, a marketing expert who arrived
with a new management team in 1990, hoping for a fast turnaround.
The recession proved deeper and longer-lasting than he had expected. Paper
and building materials prices sank to abysmal levels. Domtar faced run-in
troubles at a new Dollars 1.2bn twin-machine uncoated freesheet mill at
Sherbrooke, Quebec, a heavy floating rate debt burden as federal policy
drove interest rates higher, and a Canadian dollar which rose to a peak of
US89c late in 1991.
Most of Domtar's pulp and paper products are sold in the US, and each
one-cent move in the Canadian dollar has a Dollars 10m impact on annual
operating results. Domtar is also North America's third biggest producer of
gypsum wallboard, with several US plants.
'The Sherbrooke mill's problems are over and output is up from 325,000 to
nearly 500,000 tonnes yearly with a narrower product range, machine
speed-ups and technical improvements,' says Mr Desjardins.
'We've won full labour flexibility from the unions. Our communication and
fine paper mills, plus the newsprint and groundwood units, accounting for
half our total annual volume of nearly CDollars 2bn, are becoming fully
competitive with the US, especially with the 9 per cent drop in the Canadian
dollar in 1992.'
With about Dollars 350m just raised in Canada and the US, Domtar can retire
the maturing portion of its Dollars 1bn long-term debt and cover interest
and capital outlays this year.
'Market pulp is always a late bloomer in a recovery, but we should see
better prices this autumn and in 1994,' says Mr Desjardins.
Wallboard prices went up 10 per cent in the spring with strong US housing
starts, and construction timber has eased seasonally after an early 1992
run-up. Packaging products are firm in Canada, where Domtar is a dominant
player.
Several analysts see Domtar in the black in 1993 after three years of heavy
losses, but Mr Desjardins puts the emphasis on recovery in 1994. Much
depends on the pace of US recovery and the level of the US dollar. If it
falls, that helps Domtar's offshore business.
Domtar started off as a coal tar distiller 90 years ago, but under the
control of the late Toronto financier EP Taylor and his Argus Corporation in
the 1960s and 1970s its range was wide: from timber, pulp, newsprint,
groundwood papers, fine papers, packaging, bricks and roofing materials, to
plastics, metal powders and special chemicals, with plants in the US and
Europe. It even diversified into oil and gas.
In the 1980s Domtar bought five US wallboard plants in another
diversification move. For several years its North American wallboard
business turned in handsome profits.
Building the Dollars 1.2bn Sherbrooke uncoated freesheet mill was the next
big venture, but the recession began before Domtar could complete the run-in
period.
Profits peaked in 1987 and declined steeply in 1988 and 1989 as costs
continued to rise and prices crumbled. Between 1990 and 1992 Domtar piled up
losses of CDollars 600m, including restructuring charges.
Domtar is entering the recovery with four sound communication and fine paper
mills in Quebec and Eastern Ontario, with total capacity of well over
700,000 tonnes, plus converting and merchanting units. It has two upgraded
newsprint and groundwood paper mills and a softwood kraft pulp mill in
Quebec, that sends half its output to company paper mills with the rest sold
outside.
It has long experience in recycling and is ready for future US
recycled-content rules for paper products, so protecting its major markets.
It has developed its own process to recycle corrugated containers to make
fine papers, and the first recycling unit is being installed at its Ontario
fine paper mill. The second goes into the Sherbrooke mill for 1995 start-up.
The two projects will cost CDollars 225m.
Domtar's conglomerate days are over. Mr Desjardins wants to concentrate on
developing the core communication papers and specialty fine paper
businesses. The two newsprint and groundwood paper mills may be sold -
possibly to Donohue, a low-cost newsprint producer.
The wallboard division's future is uncertain, but linerboard and packaging
can bring healthy returns.
'Timing was our great problem in the 1980s,' says Mr Desjardins, 'but now
we've slimmed down and we're determined to rebuild our financial base with
our most cost-competitive businesses. That's where our resources will go.'

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Canadian Forest Products (9): The McDonald's way -
Profile / Abitibi-Price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETWEEN visits to customers and mills, a group of senior managers at
Abitibi-Price has been calling on companies as far removed from the
newsprint business as United Parcel Service, Hewlett-Packard and snack-food
maker Frito-Lay.
The Abitibi managers are hoping to learn some of the secrets which have made
these companies among the best performing and most admired in North American
business. Their task is to apply the lessons to the corporate culture and
financial performance of their own company.
Mr Ron Oberlander, Abitibi's chief executive, asserts that newsprint
producers will need to look inwards to boost profits over the next few
years, rather than rely on a surge in the marketplace. 'I don't see any
return to glory days,' Mr Oberlander says. 'This is going to remain a very
tough industry.'
The over-riding question for every newsprint maker in the years ahead, he
predicts, will be: 'Where are you in the cost curve?' As a result, he is
trying to hammer home the message that maximising cash flow and containing
costs are now the top priorities for Abitibi's 8,600 workers.
Abitibi made a start in 1992 by cutting the net cost of its newsprint by
CDollars 15 a tonne, and generating CDollars 175m in cash. In the first
three months of 1993, the combined operating profit of its 11 mills showed
the first quarterly year-on-year increase in five years.
Mr John Duncanson, forestry analyst at Sanwa McCarthy in Toronto, predicts
that Abitibi will be modestly profitable in 1993 after three consecutive
years of losses totalling CDollars 345m. 'I think they've got their act
together on the management side. 'But they still have a couple of hurdles to
go,' he says.
Mr John Johnson, analyst at Richardson Greenshields, forecasts a return to
profitability only in 1994.
One uncertainty still hanging over Abitibi is its ownership. Olympia &amp; York,
the crippled real estate developer, nominally has an 82 per cent stake. But
under O&amp;Y's debt restructuring, the shares are now controlled by a
consortium of international banks to which they were pledged as collateral
for a USDollars 2.5bn loan.
The banks are weighing their options. These include seeking a new
controlling shareholder, selling their shares in a public offering or
hanging on to them in the hope that the business recovery will increase
Abitibi's market value.
If Mr Oberlander has his way, Abitibi's new shareholders will find a vastly
different company from the one left behind by O&amp;Y.
Abitibi has turned its back on an ambitious but costly diversification drive
in the 1970s and 1980s to concentrate on its core business of groundwood
papers, especially newsprint. The company noted in its latest annual report:
'Frankly, it was always our core business that delivered the highest
earnings.'
Abitibi has sold, or is in the process of selling, several other businesses,
including its building products division, paper distributors and a coated
papers company.
It is also in the throes of reorganising the assets that remain. Three
business teams have been set up to deal with North American publishers,
commercial printers and international customers. Each of the 11 paper mills
is allocated to one of the divisions.
The most far-reaching changes however, are taking place at the mills
themselves. A recent study estimated that the company could have saved an
extra CDollars 45m in 1992 if each mill's performance during its best three
months could be sustained throughout the year.
Mr Oberlander, a Montrealer whose roots in the forestry industry go back to
his father's fibreboard mill, harps on the lessons which Abitibi can learn
from successful companies in other industries.
If McDonald's can produce consistently good French fries, Abitibi should be
able to do the same with groundwood papers, he insists. 'There's a
McDonald's way; there's got to be an Abitibi-Price way.'
The drive for consistently good products at low cost has begun not at
Abitibi's worst plant, but at its best, the Augusta mill in Georgia, which
is a joint venture with Thomson Corporation, the publishing and travel
group.
A team has been set up at Augusta under the regional manager and mill
manager with instructions to improve the mill's cash flow. Augusta now has
its own sales force and is taking over functions, such as invoicing and the
general ledger, previously handled by head office. Preventive maintenance is
getting more attention.
No matter how successful these efforts are, however, the extent and speed of
any commodity producer's recovery inevitably remain tied to border market
conditions over which it has little control.
Here the picture is mixed. 'Everything is tender,' Mr Oberlander says.
'We've been down so long that it's hard to believe up is possible.'
North American consumption for groundwood papers now appears to be on a
steady, through gradual, uptrend. But demand in Europe - especially the UK
and Germany - is still sagging. Abitibi's sales in offshore markets slumped
from CDollars 227m in 1991 - equal to 14 per cent of total revenues - to
CDollars 191m last year.
The company, which has a total capacity of almost 2m tonnes of newsprint and
460,000 tonnes of uncoated groundwood papers, a year, took another 20,000
tonnes out of production in April 1993, with the warning that 'further
downtime will be required in 1993 should present market conditions prevail.'

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Canadian Forest Products (8): Focus switches to
high value - Profile / MacMillan Bloedel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKERS in a sawmill in the British Columbia town of Port Alberni take
500-year old hemlock logs harvested from coastal rainforests and
painstakingly cut them into posts measuring 4 1/8 inches by 4 1/8 inches and
are typically 13ft long. The 'baby squares,' as they are called, are too
small for US homebuilders. The posts are specially cut for the Japanese
market, where expensive, light wood is prized in new homes, and beams are
exposed, rather than hidden behind the wall board.
Ancient trees are best for this market, because they provide high-quality
'clear' wood, free of knots and with highly compressed age rings that
produce a very fine grain. They also return a good value to the mill. The
'baby squares' command about Dollars 1,200 per thousand board feet, compared
with about Dollars 335 for the same measure of standard grade 2x4s used in
US homes.
When the wood reaches Japan, it might be milled further, cut into strips of
thin veneer to cover posts of the same dimension.
The Port Alberni mill and several others like it are owned and operated by
MacMillan Bloedel, British Columbia's largest integrated forest products
company. Last year MacMillan abandoned the traditional business of sawyering
 -making utility-grade lumber for the North American market - and has
focused its wood business on high-value products such as baby squares, and
trim, window casings and cedar-based patio products for sale in North
America and Europe.
The switch to specialty products has as much to do with natural resources as
it does with the market. Although timber in British Columbia is viewed as a
renewable resource, MacMillan Bloedel's supply of high value old-growth
coastal timber - mostly cedar, fir and hemlock - is declining.
The company's foresters estimate a 50-year supply of the old timber remains.
However, MacMillan's rights to cut the remaining old trees have become
entangled in controversy with environmental activists. and the company is at
risk of losing chunks of its projected harvest. Other BC timber companies
are facing similar conflicts.
Last month the company saw its potential cut in the scenic Clayoquot Sound
area of western Vancouver Island reduced to 600,000 cu m a year from 900,000
cu m in a controversial provincial decision. The potential impact to
MacMillan's bottom line is CDollars 10m, according to Mr Robert Findlay, the
company's president.
The impending 'loss of fibre,' as the company refers to the situation, has
prompted the company to do the most with what it has.
'There is less and less old growth timber,' says Mr Jim Chisholm, manager of
MacMillan Bloedel's North American lumber marketing. 'We have to take what
fibre we have and do more with it.' The solid wood business was MacMillan
Bloedel's profitable side last year, with half of its Dollars 3bn in sales
in lumber and building materials.
MacMillan often sells wood to a remanufacturer and then sells the resulting
product through its global distribution system. 'We sell the product twice,
and we make more money,' Mr Chisholm says.
The high value and remerch- andising strategy seems to be paying off. Where
in 1970 the company averaged Dollars 100 in income per 1,000 board feet of
lumber sold, it now averages over Dollars 1,000. However, as its own harvest
narrows, MacMil- lan is engaging more and more in lumber merchandising, a
lower margin business.
The company is also looking beyond the coastal rainforest, and is
aggressively pursuing 'engineered' wood that may eventually replace old
timber for structural uses.
In 1991 it entered a joint venture with a US firm to form Trus Joist
MacMillan, which currently produces four different manufactured wood
products in 14 plants across the US, and has global marketing reach. With
only Dollars 300m in annual sales, the venture is far from outpacing
MacMillan's more conven- tional operations.
MacMillan Bloedel's Vancouver-based management got a new set of shareholders
in February when Noranda Forest, which for 12 years had owned the
controlling interest in 'MacBlo,' sold out in a public offering to investors
in Canada and Europe.
The sale allowed MacMillan to cut free of the financial uncertainties
associated with Noranda, a subsidiary of the debt-plagued Hees-Edper
corporate empire owned by Canada's Bronfman family.
The 55.5m-share, CDollars 1bn offering was oversubscribed, despite the fact
that MacMillan Bloedel, squeezed by declining pulp and paper prices and
rising environmental costs, is coming out of two years of losses. Buyers
took the stock in three-part instalment receipts, for the equivalent of
Canadian Dollars 17.50.
Analysts say the shares were popular because they are an indirect investment
in the rocketing lumber market, and a gamble that newsprint prices may be
near bottom.
Mr John Johnson, a Vancouver-based lumber industry analyst for Richardson
Greenshields, forecasts 1993 earnings at 70 cents per share, and 1994
earnings of Dollars 1.50 per share, a big improvement over the company's
Dollars 48.8m or 42 cents per share loss in 1992.
However, with the company's stock price now above Dollars 20 and lumber
prices off their February peak, Mr Johnson has downgraded his recommendation
on the stock to a 'hold', from a 'buy.' The company squeaked out an
operating profit of about CDollars 7.3m in the first quarter, the first in
nine quarters.
Mr Findlay is realistic about the full-year outlook, saying it will mirror
the first quarter. 'Up, but nothing spectacular,' he says, noting the
company will benefit from better prices for lumber and cost controls in pulp
and paper.
The unprofitable pulp and newsprint business represents more than 50 per
cent of MacMillan Bloedel's Dollars 3.5bn in assets. Mr Findlay says the
company has made remarkable strides in becoming more competitive in those
areas. However, the overburdened pulp market is beyond his control. 'It will
come around in time. In this type of industry you have to weather the
storm,' he says.
In British Columbia's mountainous forests, MacMillan Bloedel is king, but it
is dwarfed by other North American forest products companies such as
Weyerhaeuser. It does not dominate any of its industries, and is subject to
pressures from lower cost producers in most of its business segments.
The company's pulp and paper revenues fell to Dollars 819m last year, for an
operating loss of Dollars 8.6m. Since 1988 its newsprint production has
dropped 34 per cent, and market pulp production is down 24 per cent. Just as
pulp prices began to slump, Canada imposed strict clean water regulations on
pulp mills, forcing a Dollars 350m effluent control programme on MacMillan
Bloedel,which has diverted investment capital from other areas.
'That was a capital investment that did not generate income,' notes Mr Eric
Lauritzen, MacMillan Bloedel vice president for pulp and paper marketing.
But he says some of the environmental costs were offset by plant
rationalisations and labour negotiations that reduced worker costs.
He points to a modest rise in newsprint costs last quarter as an indicator
that the pulp and paper recession may be moderating. With the pulp business
heavily dependent on exports to Europe, he expects prices to improve only
after capacity shake-outs and a European economic recovery. Both, he
concedes, will take time.
MacMillan Bloedel also has exposure to Europe through its 16 per cent
ownership of one of the continent's largest paper companies, NV Koninklijke
KNP, which last quarter merged with two other Netherlands companies to form
KNP BT. MacMillan recorded a Dollars 5.7m loss on its KNP BT stake in the
first quarter.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Canadian Forest Products (7): Woodpulp industry is
fighting for its life - Laurie Morse reports that the battle against
lower-cost producers will be harsh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CANADA'S woodpulp industry is in a knock-down, drag-out fight for its life,
as it struggles against lower-cost producers in the US and South America.
It will be a harsh battle, since the bottom has dropped out of the pulp
market just as Canadian producers are facing expensive new environmental
rules, fresh labour negotiations and rising raw material prices.
Currency devaluations in Scandinavia reduced northern Europe's pulp prices
to Canadian levels last year, and wiped out Canada's buffer to world
overcapacity. In the past, as the highest-cost producers, Scandinavian mills
absorbed supply imbalances, shutting down when prices fell.
Now, says Mr Eric Lauritzen, chief of MacMillan Bloedel's pulp operations,
producers are in a Darwinian struggle, with everyone producing flat-out to
see who will survive.
Fewer than five years ago, pulp and its accompanying paper manufacturing
were stars of the Canadian forest industry, generating healthy profits as
lumber prices hit cyclical lows. Pulp, which uses the byproducts of lumber
milling as its raw material, balances the solid wood side of forestry.
The seeds of the current struggle lie in the rally of 1989, when rates for
market pulp, specifically the northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK)
variety produced in western Canada, reached Dollars 840 a tonne. Canadian
forest companies capitalised on the boom, aggressively expanding capacity.
The rally was not lost on the rest of the world, and new pulp mills began to
sprout all over the Americas. These were to make use of cheaper pulp fibres,
including South American eucalyptus, US southern pine and recycled papers.
Now, as the new capacity comes on line, high cost producers are fighting for
their livelihoods.
One industry survey puts world production of market pulp, the kind that is
not immediately consumed by an affiliated paper mill, at 32.5m tonnes in
1992, while world demand was only 28m tonnes. Another 4m tonnes of capacity
is scheduled to come on-line this year and next. Of the world totals,
Canada's capacity is more than 10m tonnes. Nearly 12m tonnes of world demand
is in recession-hit Europe.
Rising inventories pushed pulp prices down to about Dollars 470 a tonne in
March, well below the average Canadian production cost of Dollars 582.
Labour problems, especially last summer's industry-wide strike, have added
to Canada's inventories. The price squeeze has forced plant shutdowns in
Canada and Sweden, and more are expected.
Mr John Johnson, invest- ment analyst for Richardson Greenshields, believes
prod- uction curtailments will bring prices above costs again in 1994.
However, other observers are less optimistic. Mr Bob Elton, an analyst for
Price Water- house, told a forestry conference in Vancouver in March that
British Columbia's pulp industry, which comp- rises half of Canada's prod-
uction, was plagued by high costs, high taxes and outmoded plants, and that
it could take 15 to 20 years for the industry to restructure itself
successfully.
Eastern Canada's pulp plants operate at slightly lower costs than the west,
but they have delayed expensive water-clean up retrofits and still must make
the heavy environment investments currently being borne in British Columbia.
Canadian pulp executives are waiting anxiously for a pick-up in the world
economy, since an upswing in paper demand, particularly news- print, could
wipe out market pulp surpluses.
The best news for pulp producers this year has by a slight improvement in
the US. The gain has stimulated an increase in newspaper advert- ising
linage, and given a small boost to the newsprint and pulp markets.
The European market has also developed a quixotic taste for non-bleached
paper, an offshoot of the growing 'green' movement. 'They're wanting brown
toilet paper and coffee filters,' says one Vancouver Island lumberjack
disparagingly.
The move away from bleached pulp and paper is founded on the fear that the
chlorines used in the bleaching process are hazardous to the environment.
Canada's govern- ment has imposed the most stringent chlorine standards in
the world on its pulp industry.
The pulp and paper industry has invested more than Dollars 1.9bn since 1989
to meet those standards, and is projected to spend Dollars 2.5bn more
virtually to eliminate potentially harmful chlorinated dioxins from their
effluents.
In response to demand from European customers, Repap, the Montreal-based
pulp and paper producer, has developed a paper bleaching process that
abandons the use of chlorines entirely. The process, which carries the trade
name Alcell, uses alcohol instead of chlorine or the sulphur-based chemicals
that produce the characteristic pulp-mill smell.
Repap has successfully applied the process to hard- wood pulp, and is
adapting it for use with Canada's more abundant softwoods. The company says
the process is substantially cheaper than those used in conventional kraft
pulp mills, and that it produces valuable adhesives and solvents as
byproducts.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Canadian Forest Products (6): US housing market is
key to lumber rally - Laurie Morse asks whether the forests 'gold rush' can
be sustained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Adeclining and rather unremarkable little creature has sparked a gold rush
in Canada's forests, reversing three years of losses and providing some
breathing room to the embattled forest products industry.
Concern over the ecological stability of the Northern Spotted Owl, which
resides well south of the Canadian border in California, Washington and
Oregon has brought timber cutting in those states to a near-halt.
Canadian loggers have attempted to make up the production shortfall, reaping
windfall profits from lumber prices which have, in some cases, doubled since
October. A Price Waterhouse analysis says the turnaround in wood prices sent
the Canadian forest industry's profits to Dollars 180m in 1992, compared
with Dollars 869m losses in 1991. The improvement is expected to accelerate
in 1993, since the bulk of the lumber rally occurred between January and
March.
The sustainability of the timber rally, and the profits of forestry
companies, however, depend upon growth in the US housing market and the
extent to which substitute products are available.
Canada historically has provided the US with 99 per cent of its lumber
imports, or about 30 per cent of its total needs. Lumber company executives
view themselves as 'marginal' suppliers to the US market, and as having only
a small role in determining North American lumber prices.
However, the western US timber harvest dropped 60 per cent last year to
2.64bn board feet. At the same time, US homebuilding rebounded, increasing
US lumber demand by 3bn board feet to 45.2bn, a six-year high.
Future US harvests are expected to be even smaller, based on federal timber
sales to date. Mr John Combes, a timber management analyst with the US
Forest Service, says court injunctions linked to the spotted owl in the
Pacific Northwest caused sales on government-owned lands to dwindle from 9bn
board feet in 1987 to 2bn in 1992.
'The shortfall in the US Pacific northwest is very large. British Columbia
alone can't make up the shortage, because we are already logging very close
to our allowable cut. Supply is a serious constraint in this market,' says
Mr Richard Bryan, chief economist for the Council of Forest Industries in
British Columbia, where 80 per cent of Canada's US lumber exports are
produced.
The price of a standard Canadian softwood (spruce, pine or fir) 2x4 board
rose from Dollars 230 a thousand board feet in February 1992 to a record
Dollars 475 this February. Since the peak, the price has eased to about
Dollars 320. The up-and-down volatility has unnerved some mill managers.
Mr Laurence Cater, lumber analyst and publisher of Madison's Canadian Lumber
Reporter, explains that the rally stalled because a March storm that dropped
snow up and down the eastern US slowed homebuilding just as a late freeze
allowed additional log harvesting in Canada.
According to the US Commerce Department, housing starts dropped to 1.13m
units on an annualised basis in March, the slowest rate since July. However,
with US mortgage rates at record lows and fine weather in April,
homebuilding is expected to rebound. Mr Cater says that if US housing starts
reach a projected 1.2m units in 1993, 'it will tax the limits of the North
American lumber industry,' and sustain higher prices.
However, the economics of timber processing traditionally requires a balance
between prices paid for lumber and chips, a sawmill byproduct that is the
raw material for pulp. Overcapacity has turned pulp prices into a disaster
this year. Limited chip demand has, in some cases, slowed lumber milling
even as lumber prices rise.
Mr Ross Hay-Roe, forest products specialist for Vancouver-based Research
Capital Corp, says picking companies that will profitably ride out the
lumber price boom can be tricky. Slocan Forest Products, based in Richmond,
BC, is what he terms a 'model' sawmill. It is projected to have earnings per
share of Dollars 3.30 in 1993, up from 25 cents in 1992. The increase will
be almost entirely due to beneficial lumber prices.
Donohue, a newsprint, pulp, and lumber company based in Quebec, is viewed as
a well-integrated company that stands to benefit from strengthening
newsprint prices as well as the current lumber boom.
So far, the ballistic price increases have not turned buyers from the
Canadian market. The Canadian dollar has weakened against the US currency,
and continues to decline against the Japanese yen, buffering the rally.
Japanese buyers, who prefer high-grade old-growth coastal lumber from
British Columbia, may be paying five times as much for lumber this year than
last in Canadian dollar terms, but see no price increase in their own
currency.
Unlike the US, the vast majority of Canadian forests are government-owned.
Forestry companies operating on crown lands are subject to intricate
provincial harvest limits and fees. As demand for other forest uses,
including tourism and land claims by indigenous peoples, increases, timber
cutting on crown lands, particularly in British Columbia, will decline.
To fill the gap, lumber production in the provinces of Alberta and
Saskatchewan is rising this year. Lumber harvests in the fast-growing
softwood forests of the southeastern US and eastern Canada are also on the
rise, although wetlands protection legislation will limit that expansion.
Some Canadian companies such as BC-based MacMillan Bloedel are gradually
expanding their US holdings, basing fibre-processing plants in such states
as Minnesota and Alabama, where cheap, low quality wood is abundant.
Over the much longer run, Canadian foresters worry that their exclusive role
in supplying the US lumber deficit will be usurped by foreign timber. 'There
is no global shortage of (wood) fibre,' says Mr John Johnson, forest
industry analyst with Richardson Greenshields. The US has begun to import
wood from Honduras, Costa Rica and Chile, and as far away as New Zealand.
The competitor that Canadian forest executives most fear, however, is
Russia. Although only small lumber shipments have so far made their way to
Washington State, Russia's huge forest lands and its thirst for hard
currency makes a larger trade inevitable. Russia contains 51 per cent of the
world's coniferous forests which, if harvesting and processing
infrastructure were upgraded, could supply much of the globe's demand for
timber.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Canadian Forest Products (5): Bureaucrats test
Japanese patience - Bernard Simon looks at the problems of, and
opportunities for, foreign investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The advice to investors in Canada's forestry industry given by Mr Keith
Fujieda, president of MC Forest Products of Vancouver, a subsidiary of
Japan's Mitsubishi Trading is succinct: 'You have to be patient.'
Mitsubishi and its partners, Kanzaki Paper of Japan and Crestbrook Forest
Industries of Vancouver (in which Mitsu- bishi has a 25 per cent stake),
endured several years of public hearings, private negotiations and loud
environmental protests before they were able to start work on a CDollars
1.3bn hardwood pulp mill in nort- hern Alberta.
The mill is finally due to come into production later this year, but is
unlikely to be prof- itable before 1998. Nonetheless, Mr Fujieda is
confident that the time, energy and money spent bringing the project to
fruition will eventually be worthwhile: 'It was a very painful two years,
but we have come up with the best pulp mill.'
Mitsubishi is one of several Japanese companies which began investing
heavily in Canada in the late 1980s when capital was cheap and abun- dant.
They were especially attracted to Alberta, which was eager to diversify
beyond the oil and gas industry, and - unlike British Columbia, Ontario and
Quebec - had not allocated the bulk of the timber rights to its forests.
Daishowa Paper and Maru- beni are partners in a pulp mill near Peace River,
Alberta. Daishowa also bought a saw- mill in the province in 1990.
As part of its 1988 purchase of Reed International's North American
business, Daishowa took over a newsprint, pulp and paperboard mill near
Quebec City. It also owns a nearby sawmill and has built a de-inking plant
at the paper mill.
The most admired Japanese investment in Canada is Oji Paper's partnership
with Can- for in the CDollars 1.3bn expansion of the Howe Sound pulp and
paper mill north of Vancouver.
The mill, widely viewed as a model for the rest of the indus- try, combines
Canfor's exper- tise in pulp with Oji's presence in the newsprint market.
Oji helped finance the expansion.
According to Statistics Canada, about 44 per cent of Canada's pulp and paper
industry was foreign-owned in the late 1980s (the latest figures available).
This is roughly on a par with the foreign presence in other resource-based
sectors such as mining and energy.
Many foreign-held companies are wholly-owned, so they do not have the same
high profile as the publicly-traded Canad- ian producers.
The biggest US subsidiaries include Stone-Consolidated, Kimberly-Clark,
Boise Cascade and Weyerhaeuser. Among European companies, Stora and Bowater
have newsprint mills in Nova Scotia. Stora also produces pulp.
For some foreign investors however, the drawbacks of doing business in
Canada have recently more than offset the benefits. The attractions of the
US south compared to the high-cost Canadian industry led several US
companies to reduce their exposure to Canada in the 1970s and 1980s.
More recently, Fletcher Challenge, the New Zealand company which bought two
large British Columbia forestry companies in the mid-1980s, has lightened
its Canadian portfolio. It has sold several of the businesses included in
the earlier purchases, and has cut its stake in its Canadian subsidiary from
72 to 63 per cent.
Mr Doug Whitehead, pres- ident of Fletcher Challenge Canada, ticks off a
string of irritants, including a new labour law in British Colum- bia, high
taxes and what Mr Whitehead calls 'a lack of clarity' on such issues as
aboriginal rights in logging areas, and the size of the allowable cut on
provincially owned land.
The prevailing mood among most foreign companies is summed up by Ms Patricia
Dietz, an official at Stora's Canadian subsidiary: 'It's tough, but we're
hanging in there.'
Recent investments, whether by foreign-controlled or domestic companies,
have mostly been restricted to meeting environmental standards or to
modernising existing facilities.
For instance, Stora, which has suffered losses for the past three years in
Canada, is building a CDollars 60m secondary treatment plant at its Port
Hawkesbury newsprint mill to comply with fish protection laws. The Swedish
parent will decide later this year whether to spend CDollars 100m on a
recycling facility.
A few projects are more ambitious. The most notable of these is Oji's
involvement in the Howe Sound expansion project. Another is nearing
completion at a pulp mill near Castlegar, British Columbia, which is jointly
owned by China International Trust and Investment Corp (Citic), Venepal of
Venezuela and Chicago-based Stone Container.
The CDollars 700m expansion - which took 14 months to wend its way through
the govern- ment approval process - will more than double capacity from 535
to 1,200 tonnes a day of bleached northern kraft pulp.
Mr Howard Hart, president of the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association in
Montreal, predicts that as barriers in the international pulp and paper
trade fall - as the Canadian industry hopes they will - foreign investment
in Canada and Canadian investment abroad are bound to expand still further.
Mr Whitehead at Fletcher Challenge says that the Japanese are again taking a
close look at Canada. The driving forces this time are the strong yen and
fears of a shortage of logs, chips and other wood products.
European investors cast a tangible vote of confidence last February by
snapping up about a quarter of the 49 per cent of MacMillan Bloedel, which
was put on the block by Noranda Forest.
Nevertheless, forestry executives are unanimous that foreign interest in
Canada would be a lot stronger if politicians and bureaucrats were to show a
greater willingness to loosen their leash on the industry.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Canadian Forest Products (2): There may be no
simple answers - Is the industry doing too much or not enough to protect the
environment?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the battle over forestry's impact on the environment, there are few
rights and wrongs - only a barrage of strongly-held opinions.
Mr John Cashore, environment minister in British Columbia's Social Democrat
government, compares the province's forests and waterways to Europe's
ancient cathedrals. 'A lot of us look on representative ecosystems as a
heritage which should be protected,' he says. Forestry companies and their
workers retort that enthusiasm to protect the environment has come to
threaten jobs, investment and even worker safety.
Noting plans by BC and Ontario to introduce the world's toughest pulp mill
effluent standards, Mr Patrick Moore, a director of the Forest Alliance of
BC, a joint industry-labour group, says: 'You could see it as leading the
world, or you could see it as going overboard.'
The issues seldom lend themselves to simple answers. For example: Is it
wrong to cut down old trees if they are replaced by new ones? Can trees in a
forest be felled selectively as an alternative to the clear-cuts which
denude entire mountainsides and valleys? Are tougher effluent curbs
justified when the technology to implement them has yet to be invented?
Both the industry and its critics, however, have to live with two
incontrovertible facts. First, Canada's trees will continue to be destroyed
in large numbers so long as society demands timber for houses and paper for
offices. Second, the forestry companies can no longer go about their
business without taking account of the impact on nature.
Environmental pressures vary from one part of the country to another. The
differences are evident in the performance of individual companies. All but
one of British Columbia's 22 pulp mills have pledged to comply with a
federal government rule which will require non-measurable levels of dioxins
and furans in pulp mill effluent by January 1994. By contrast, 37 of the 39
mills in Quebec have asked for an extension.
One reason for this discrepancy is the hodge-podge of federal and provincial
regulations.
West coast companies complain that they are subject to harsher public
scrutiny (and in some cases, tighter rules) than their counterparts in
Ontario and Quebec. While Alberta has expanded timber- cutting rights in
recent years for the benefit of new investors in pulp and paper mills,
neighbouring British Columbia is scaling back.
In addition, the demarcation between federal and provincial jurisdiction is
not always clear. While clean-water standards fall under the provinces,
Ottawa has responsibility for protecting fish habitats.
Federal regulations currently require pulp mills to cut the level of
chlorinated organic compounds in their effluent to 2.5kg per tonne by 1994.
But BC and Ontario have recently announced much more ambitious targets. BC
wants mills be down to 1.5kg per tonne by 1995 and zero by 2002; Ontario has
also proposed a zero limit within the next decade.
Mr Cashore says he is confident not only that west coast companies will
reach the targets, but that they will be pioneers in developing and selling
the necessary technology.
However, the industry's view is that the marginal benefits of a
'zero-tolerance' policy do not warrant the enormous financial cost which may
be involved. Noranda noted sardonically in its last annual report that 'as
technology is not currently available to meet these requirements, the
economic consequences of these laws cannot be determined'.
The same tone of exasperation is evident in the debate on logging practices.
Mr Moore notes the puzzling discrepancy between public concern about trees
before they reach a sawmill, and ready acceptance of processed timber
products.
He points to numerous initiatives taken by the industry in recent years to
improve its stewardship of the forests. These range from environmental
committees set up at worksites, to smaller clear-cuts, greater care in
building roads and educational trips for schoolchildren. The quintessential
Canadian image of logs floating a river is almost a thing of the past.
But these moves have failed to satisfy the environmental movement or some
politicians, especially in British Columbia. Ms Vicki Husband, director of
the Sierra Club of Western Canada, complains that the land set aside for
commercial logging 'is the most productive forest land, but it's also the
most productive for wildlife, fish habitats and often for tourism.'
About 90 per cent of British Columbia's forests are owned by the province.
Three years ago, the government directed the major companies to give up 5
per cent of their annual allowable cut in favour of smaller entrepreneurs
who were demanding access to more raw material.
The big companies are also likely to be the main victims of BC's plan to
double the area set aside for parks and wilderness areas from 6 to 12 per
cent in the next decade.
The province's chief forester is currently revising the annual allowable
harvest rate for 70 separate 'planning units' with a view to setting new
limits on the 'sustainable harvest'. This exercise is due to be completed by
the end of 1994, but significant rollbacks have already been proposed for
some areas.
Meanwhile, a tree-cutting moratorium has been imposed in several areas while
a Commission on Resources and the Environment develops a new land use
strategy, including a mechanism to settle disputes.
MacMillan Bloedel estimates that the province's efforts to expand protected
areas could affect up to 13 per cent of its land base in BC and 14 per cent
of its current timber quota (known as the annual allowable cut). More
stringent harvesting guidelines could result in another 5-10 per cent
shrinkage in volumes.
In an effort to chart policies acceptable to the industry as well as its
critics, the BC government earlier this year set up a strategy group on
forest issues. Mr Dan Miller, the forests minister, says that he has told
all participants 'to check your baggage at the door.'
Mr Miller says that everything will be on the table, including the size of
the annual allowable cut. 'The challenge is for government, labour and
industry to come together to ensure that we are competitive,' he says.
The companies have their doubts however, whether this initiative will be any
more successful than previous ones in addressing their concerns. MacMillan
Bloedel, the biggest west coast producer, noted in a recent report to
shareholders that previous workshops set up by regulatory authorities have
been ineffective, 'as constructive comments are largely being ignored'.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Canadian Forest Products (4): Two sides face new
realities - Labour Relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN WISENTHAL

<TEXT>
TECHNOLOGICAL change, increased world competition and a reduced supply of
raw materials have created a new relationship between organised labour and
Canada's forest industries.
While friendly may be too strong a word for dealings between the opposing
parties, the unions have become more co-operative, and employers have been
prepared to reward concessions on work practices.
In many areas, such as the conflict with environmentalists and the challenge
of international competitors, the two sides have recognised that their
interests are similar.
The unions' attitude to change in the workplace is based on the calculation
that it is better to lose a few jobs at a mill than to have no mill at all.
Mr Doug Smyth, head of research at the Vancouver-based Canadian branch of
the International Woodworkers of America (IWA), says efficiency is vital.
'You have to increase productivity to survive in world markets. We not only
went along with the productivity improvements (requested by management) but
in many cases we insisted on them so the jobs of our members would be
protected,' he says.
The IWA in British Columbia was one of the earliest unions to face the new
reality. In the cyclical downturn from 1980 to 1982, employment in the wood
products sector which the IWA dominates fell at about the same pace as
production. But when demand picked up in 1983, employment stayed at about
the same level and productivity soared.
Mr Mark Thompson, a professor of industrial relations at University of
British Columbia, points to a long-term pattern, with workers being highly
paid and militantly unionised, and companies responding by becoming more
capital-intensive.
Some sectors have slipped from the IWA's grasp. Most remaining shake and
shingle mills - hit by high US duties - have gone non-union or have special
deals. The plywood industry has also suffered, with some mills going to
employee co-operatives. But in the core dimension lumber sector, the IWA
remains entrenched.
To face its strength, employers in British Columbia work through combined
bargaining bodies. Forest Industrial Relations (FIR) represents companies on
the coast, and there are two equivalent organisations in the interior.
Unlike the lumber industry, the pulp and paper sector has always been very
capital-intensive. Automation has increased in recent years, but there has
not been the same scope for large productivity gains.
The greatest pressure on the pulp and paper industry is coming from US mills
where employees have agreed five- and six-year no-strike contracts which
provide for 365-day-a-year operation.
Canadian unions have fought hard over the years for the right to take off
statutory holidays such as Christmas Day, but now the employers want to talk
again, because of the cost of having half a billion dollars' worth of
machine sitting idle.
Mr Thompson suggests that employees may have to give up some of their
holidays and other provisions to allow 365-day operation in Canada.
'Emotionally, that's hard for a union to swallow'.
In the latest downturn, there have been some pulp and paper mill shutdowns
on the west coast, and there will probably be more, but the axe has fallen
hardest in the east.
Mr Bob Strother, vice-president of human resources at Noranda Forest, says:
'Because of competitive pressures, there has been a lot of downsizing and
restructuring. A lot of mills in the east are not competitive and a lot of
jobs have been lost permanently.'
Shutdowns are having an effect. Mr Strother says: 'There's an increased
recognition by everybody involved that everybody's interests have to be
accommodated.'
One indication of change has come at four Ontario box plants owned by
Domtar, where 500 workers have agreed an eight-year contract retroactive to
July 1991. Their union, the Independent Paperworkers of Canada, broke away
from the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers of Canada, saying that
union had failed to be flexible enough to ensure the survival of members'
jobs.
It remains to be seen if similar agreements can be reached in current
negotiations in eastern Canada. Most of the industry agreed three-year
contracts in 1990, the majority of which expired at the end of April.
The BC pulp and paper industry's contract - agreed after a 5 1/2 -week
strike in 1992 does not come up until next year.
In the pulp and paper sector, there has been a clear differentiation between
British Columbia and eastern Canada. In the east, contracts have been
reached through 'pattern bargaining'. The unions reach an agreement with one
major employer and then try to impose those terms on the rest of the
industry.
In BC, the pulp and paper industry has traditionally negotiated with the
unions at a single table. But now the employers have abandoned their joint
negotiating body in favour of mill-by-mill negotiations. The Pulp and Paper
Employee Relations Forum (analogous to FIR in the wood products industry)
will now act as an adviser to individual companies, rather than handling
negotiations directly.
The unions are expected to react by attempting to establish pattern
bargaining in BC. Ideally, this will allow more flexibility to reach
agreements which reflect the requirements of each mill. But the last strike
was about work practices and next year's negotiations could be fairly
sticky.
One indication of the new climate of co-operation in British Columbia is the
Western Wood Products Forum, where the IWA and six of the biggest wood
products industry employers work together on non-collective bargaining
issues.
Mr Chris Duke, its executive director, says the forum is an attempt to build
consensus on how to solve industry problems. Its latest report concludes
that thousands more jobs will be lost as the availability of fibre declines
over the next 10 years.
Another issue is the fate of workers laid off from mills. Their skills are
often not readily transferable to other industries and many forest products
plants are based in one-industry towns.
Despite having to share some pain, Canadian forestry workers are among the
most productive and best paid in the world, and they are going to fight to
keep it that way.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Canadian Forest Products (3): Attack is best line
of defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE belief that attack is the best line of defence, Canada's forestry
industry has mounted a vigorous campaign in Europe to dampen rumblings of
protest against its environmental practices
The forestry companies are trying to ensure that they do not suffer the same
fate as Canada's fur trappers. The fur export trade was all but obliterated
in the mid-1980s by a consumer boycott spearheaded by European
conservationists.
Photos of cuddly baby seals being clubbed to death on the ice floes of
Newfoundland had a powerful impact on public opinion abroad. With those
images in mind, the forestry industry was galvanised into action when
pictures started appearing in Europe two years ago of unsightly 'clear-cuts'
across the scenic mountainsides of British Columbia.
Pulp customers, especially in Germany and the UK, reported that buyers of
their paper products were having second thoughts about dealing with
companies whose raw material came from Canada. Threats of a consumer boycott
began to surface.
Europe is important to the Canadian industry in several ways. It is a
sizeable market, buying about 15 per cent of total pulp and paper shipments,
worth about CDollars 2.5bn a year. Moreover, several of the Canadians' chief
competitors are European companies.
The industry's public relations antennae have become much more sensitive
since the boycott scare. In one of several moves to raise the industry's
profile in Europe, the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association opened an office
in Brussels last autumn. The federal government has contributed CDollars
1.5m towards the cost of running the CPPA office.
'There seems to be a need to respond to general questions of an industry
nature,' says Mr Howard Hart, CPPA president. 'The questions relate
increasingly to our products and our environmental practices.'
European journalists, politicians and other opinion-makers have become
frequent visitors to forests and mills in Canada, often at the industry's
expense.
One recent guest of Vancouver-based Canfor Corp was Dr Egon Klepsch,
president of the European parliament. Dr Klepsch said that he would return
to Europe 'as an advocate for Canadian forestry. Canada is a model for all
of us.'
According to Mr Hart, the industry is aiming its message at four main
targets in Europe: customers, the media, outside experts (such as academics)
and government.
European critics' concerns centre on product standards and industrial
processes. The industry is under pressure to prove that its papers either
contain recycled materials or can be re-used or recycled themselves.
Being in the spotlight has undoubtedly nudged the industry towards more
environmentally friendly practices, and intensified pressure on governments
to tighten regulations.
A rising proportion of pulp exports to European customers is chlorine-free.
'There's no scientific evidence to suggest that they need it,' says Mr Peter
Bentley, Canfor's Austrian-born chairman. 'But if they want it, we intend to
make it.' Two of Canfor's three mills now produce chlorine-free pulp.
But whether because of the industry's quick response or because the extent
of the threat was misjudged in the first place, early fears of customer
resistance to Canadian pulp and paper in Europe appear to have been
exaggerated.
Mr Bentley half-jokes that this may be because the forest industry's foes,
unlike critics of the fur trade, 'haven't found a Brigitte Bardot yet'. For
the time being however, the Canadians have no intention of lowering their
guard.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Canadian Forest Products (1): Glory can be
regained - After one of the most difficult periods in recent memory, hopes
are high that the industry will return to break-even by the end of the year.
Now mergers may be needed to create companies with the muscle to take on the
world again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
High up a mountainside on Vancouver Island, a small group of lumberjacks
employed by British Columbia's Canfor Corporation are doing their bit to
help Canada's forest industry regain its past glory.
They are clearing a splendid fir, cedar and hemlock forest in a way designed
to maximise profit and minimise waste.
Trees have been felled with stumps just a few inches above the ground so
that as much timber as possible can be turned into the high-quality veneers
and decorative panels for which Canada's coastal forests are famous. Many of
the fallen trees, which might have been abandoned as debris a few years ago,
are now being loaded onto a truck to begin their journey to a pulp mill.
But the Canfor workers' performance also leaves a good deal to be desired. A
truck driver carelessly trims 18 inches off a valuable yellow cedar log,
greatly diminishing its commercial value. A forester complains that workers
have yet to learn how to move the precious logs - worth as much as CDollars
40,000 apiece - without damaging the wood.
The scene on the shorn Vancouver Island forest is a metaphor for Canada's
entire forestry business. Shaken by a series of commercial, social and
political jolts, the industry is in the throes of its biggest upheaval ever.
It has already made wrenching adjustments, from corporate shake-ups and
improved environmental practices, to new products and closer scrutiny of
labour relations.
There is near-unanimity, however, that more is needed if Canada is fully to
recapture the respect it enjoyed in the days when Abitibi-Price of Toronto
was the world's biggest newsprint producer and British Columbia's lumber
mills spurred the Allied war effort with wood for Mosquito fighter-bombers.
'Change is not going to stop,' predicts Mr Ronald Oberlander, Abitibi's
chief executive.
Forestry remains a pillar of Canada's economy. With products ranging from
commodity-grade pulp and planks to fine papers and moulded parts for car
doors, it is the biggest manufacturing industry, contributing 8.5 per cent
of gross domestic product and employing over 1m people.
British Columbia, on the west coast, specialises in lumber. Interior
sawmills produce mainly for the US housing market, while plants along the
coast are geared to more sophisticated products, mainly for Japan.
In central Canada, Ontario and Quebec are the bastions of the pulp and paper
industry. Nova Scotia and New Brunswick on the east coast are also sizeable
producers, and activity has increased in recent years in Alberta.
The hallmark of the Canadian industry, especially in British Columbia, has
always been the superb quality of its raw material. Taking almost a century
to reach their full height, the trees - grown in the damp and cold northern
climate - produce timber with an exquisite grain. The long, strong fibres
make some of the finest papers in the world.
But in the 1970s, users began to discover that faster-growing trees in the
US South, Brazil and other warm parts of the world could be turned into many
of the same products, at much lower cost. The quality might not have been as
high, but it was acceptable enough for Canadian suppliers to start feeling
the pinch of competition.
Canada also began falling behind its traditional Scandinavian rivals in
adapting forestry practices and mill processes to increasingly stringent
environmental standards. It was slow to catch the newsprint recycling wave
which swept through the US in the 1980s.
Left with relatively small and outdated mills, the Canadian industry was
gradually transformed, in the words of Mr Dan Miller, British Columbia's
forestry minister, from a price setter to a price taker.
The industry's shortcomings came home to roost with a vengeance in 1990 when
over-capacity around the world compounded stagnant demand for pulp,
newsprint and many other types of paper.
The slump in prices coincided with mounting pressure on Canadian companies
to make up lost ground on the environmental front. Customers have
increasingly demanded pulp with little or none of the chlorine traditionally
used as a bleaching agent.
Environmental groups, especially in western Canada, have mounted emotive
campaigns against the toxic effluents spewed out by pulp mills and the
'clear-cuts' which can transform a scenic mountainside into a pile of
matchstick-like debris.
Left-of-centre governments in British Columbia and Ontario have stepped up
the pressure by reducing allowable cuts in provincially-owned forests and
imposing new pulp-mill effluent targets. Broader economic policies, such as
higher taxes and restrictive labour legislation, have made life even more
uncomfortable.
The result is that the Canadian companies have found themselves squeezed
simultaneously from several sides. They have had to cut costs and rejig
their business strategies while spending heavily to modernise mills and
improve environmental standards. Pollution-abatement spending has soared
from about CDollars 100m a year in the mid-1980s to CDollars 700-800m in the
early 1990s.
According to Price Waterhouse, publicly-listed Canadian forestry companies
have swung from a combined net profit of CDollars 2.4bn in 1989 to net
losses of CDollars 2.5bn in 1991 and about CDollars 1.2bn last year. Mr Mike
MacCallum, a PW partner in Vancouver, predicts there will be a combined 1993
loss of about CDollars 500m.
About 800,000 tonnes of uneconomic newsprint and 300,000 tonnes of pulp
capacity have been taken out of production in the past three years. Leading
companies such as Abitibi-Price, Fletcher Challenge Canada and
Montreal-based Domtar have sharpened their focus by selling off peripheral
businesses.
The industry has something to show for the pain it has endured. Some pulp
mills have already met effluent guidelines due to come into force in 1995.
Fifteen newsprint mills are now equipped to use recycled paper as a
feedstock, compared with only two in 1991.
In the forests, companies are moving to smaller, less visible clear-cuts.
Some have belatedly invested in cable log-hauling systems which require
fewer roads and minimise damage to the logs.
But much still remains to be done. Mr MacCallum says that 'we have some very
efficient plants, but because they're small, we have twice as many workers
per tonne as are being used elsewhere.'
Mr Doug Whitehead, president of Fletcher Challenge Canada, adds that, to be
successful, 'you've either got to be really big, or small and
niche-picking.'
Whether the industry can sustain its new-found enthusiasm for change and
sacrifice may depend on trends in the marketplace. Record lumber prices -
stemming mainly from fears that more and more trees will be declared
out-of-bounds to loggers - have given a welcome lift to corporate earnings
in the past six months.
The North American newsprint market is showing signs of life as economic
recovery takes hold. Pulp producers, who have recently taken the hardest
knocks, are also crossing fingers that the worst will soon be behind them.
Rising profits and a spate of recent equity issues will give Canadian
companies the financial resources they have lacked in recent years to spread
their wings.
Signs of an impending spate of mergers and acquisitions have begun to
emerge. MacMillan Bloedel, the biggest west coast producer, now has no
controlling shareholder following the public offering last February of a 49
per cent stake held by Noranda Forest. Stone Container of Chicago has
signalled a willingness to sell at least part of wholly-owned
Stone-Consolidated.
Abitibi-Price is nominally 82 per cent owned by Olympia &amp; York, the crippled
property developer. But O&amp;Y's shares are controlled by its creditors, and
are likely to be put on the market at some point.
Many see a few sizeable mergers and takeovers as a way for Canada's forestry
companies to build on the progress of the past few years. The survivors
would at least be equipped with the muscle they need to take on the world
again.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: North American producers buy
Russian aluminium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH AMERICAN producers have bought about 100,000 tonnes of cheap Russian
aluminium to blend with their own metal, according to trade sources.
The bulk of the Russian material, of a quality too low to be sold on the
London Metal Exchange, was taken by Alcan of Canada, including 40,000 tonnes
to use at its smelter at Lynemouth in the north of England.
Ironically, Russian exports have driven down aluminium prices to a level
below the cash costs of most western smelters by causing a big supply
surplus. Alcan cut output at Lynemouth, one of the highest-cost smelters, by
50 per cent from its 130,000 tonnes annual capacity and the metal imported
from Russia will help to make up the shortfall.
A similar situation persists in Brazil where the closure of Alcan's Aratu
smelter has left room for the group's subsidiary to import about 2,500
tonnes of the Russian material for its rolling and processing operations.
Traders suggest that there was a big increase in exports of 'off-grade'
Russian aluminium from the middle of last year and that there might be as
much as 500,000 tonnes in Rotterdam warehouses. As it is not of the right
quality for the LME, the material does not show up on the exchange's stock
figures but it does have an impact on LME prices because traders know of its
availability.
VAW Aluminium of Germany, which is taking Russian aluminium in exchange for
technological help with the modernisation of the Novokuznetsk smelter in
Siberia, also bought some off-grade material last year at a Dollars 270 a
tonne discount to the LME price.
Traders say that buying by the North American companies has cut the discount
to Dollars 100 a tonne.
Alcoa, the world's biggest aluminium group, said that it bought some of the
Russian metal to test its chemistry and to see how it performed. Apart from
that, Alcoa said that it had not gone out specifically to buy Russian
aluminium but had probably acquired some in its spot purchasing programme.
Kaiser Aluminium, fourth-largest North American aluminium company, said it
had bought 'small quantities' of off-grade Russian aluminium from time to
time over the past few months.
Alcan said the future of the Lynemouth smelter depended on its ability to
negotiate a new supply contract with British Coal which owns the Ellington
Colliery, literally underneath the plant.
Mr Paul Belanger, managing director of Alcan Primary and Recycling, said
that coal from elsewhere in the world cost only 40 per cent of that supplied
by British Coal. Closure of Lynemouth would not only affect the 480 smelter
employees but also 1,600 at Ellington, which sells 1.2m tonnes of its 2.1m
tonnes annual output to Alcan.

GOLD moved between good support and resistance on the London bullion market
yesterday. Dealers said that selling emerged near to Dollars 356.50 a troy
ounce, and above that level Australian and South African producers were
likely to come into the market. However, when the price was pushed down
below Dollars 355 there was good support from fund buying in New York. 'Gold
has just been bouncing around between the two levels, it's a pretty aimless
market at the moment,' one dealer said. Some said they were finding it
impossible to deal in the market. Copper's weakness on the LME fed through
to ALUMINIUM, which faltered when three-month metal reached Dollars 1,170 a
tonne and tumbled back below Dollars 1,150 on speculative liquidation.
London's robusta COFFEE extended earlier gains as New York staged a modest
bounce after the sharp fall earlier in the week. Dealers said the market
could soon begin to stabilise after its volatile spell, but the prospects of
any major advance had been severely dented. High stocks and weak summer
demand might also help to ensure the market's bias is more likely to be on
the downside.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALF A MILLION British sheep are still affected by the restrictions imposed
on farms in the wake of the Chernobyl nuclear accident seven years ago, the
government has admitted.
The restrictions still cover as many as 631 British farms with a combined
land area of well over 400,000 acres. Wales is the worst affected region,
accounting for more than half the affected farms and animals.
The radioactive cloud caused by the accident passed over Britain on the
weekend of May 3-4, 1986, upon which the public was advised not to drink
fresh rainwater.
In mid-May, caesium levels in lambs started to build up leading on May 20 to
a three-week ban on movement and slaughter of 4.2m sheep.
This week's admission came in a written answer from Mr David Curry, junior
agriculture minister in reply to a question from Mr Llew Smith, the Labour
MP for Blaenau Gwent.

<TEXT>
A small Australian company allied with a Siberian gold producer has admitted
that it still needs to get a licence from Russia's State Geology Committee
to clinch a deal to exploit the country's biggest hard rock gold deposit.
But Mr Mikhail Galiatin, the Moscow-based lawyer for the Australian partner,
Star Technology Systems, added the latter, as proof of its commitment to the
project, would first make a downpayment of at least Dollars 20m, the first
instalment of its Dollars 250m investment, before approaching the committee.
The committee, which is responsible for licensing the exploitation of
mineral deposits, has argued throughout that the Australian-Russian Lena
Gold joint stock company did not have a valid licence to the Sukhoi Log
deposit.
But Ms Louise Moore, Star Technology Systems' representative in Moscow, has
until now insisted that there was no need to get the a licence from the
committee on the grounds that it had already a go-ahead from local
authorities.
The law says that rights to deposits on which work had already begun by the
time natural resources legislation came into effect last summer had to be
validated by a licence from the committee, to be applied for within a month.
The main question now is whether the committee will issue a licence, or
raise other long-standing objections to the deal. 'I am 100 per cent certain
that Lena Gold can fulfil any requirements which may be legally set by the
State Geology Committee,' Mr Galiatin said. The government, which is divided
and still embroiled in political crisis after last week's referendum, has
also looked at the project but has so far not tried to impose any particular
decision on the committee.
Mr Galiatin added that another obstacle had only recently been removed by
the Committee for State Property, which has defended the deal but
erroneously liquidated the Russian state-owned enterprise that held the
licence to the deposit. This made it possible for Mr Yegor Gaidar, then
prime minister, to declare a tender for other Russian companies to develop
the deposit last winter. This tender was never held, partly because of a
change of government in December but also because of internal divisions over
how to handle the case. The Committee for State Property finally corrected
its own mistake last month by issuing new documents transforming the Russian
enterprise into a joint stock company in which Star is to hold 31 per cent
of the shares.
Another remaining obstacle is the government's failure so far to declassify
information on the Sukhoi Log deposit, which Star had previously cited as a
condition set by its bankers for the release of money raised for the
project. But Mr Galiatin said he was working on an alternative arrangement
whereby Russian authorities would show data to interested parties without
publishing it.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cargill's Indian salt plan
arouses bitterness - Local producers do not relish multinational competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON MAY 17, thousands of activists, politicians, trade unionists and salt
farmers will brave the scorching sun and march to a piece of flat marshy
land in Kandla port, on the west coast of India's Gujarat state, to protest
against the government's decision to allow Cargill, the giant US
multinational, to set up a salt manufacturing unit there.
Encouraged by India's new economic liberalisation programme, Cargill
Southeast Asia obtained an approval from the government's Foreign Investment
Promotion Board last August to set up a 100 per cent export-oriented unit to
produce 1m tonnes of high-quality sun-dried or solar industrial salt a year.
Cargill, the US-based multinational company, produces 5m tonnes of salt a
year at its plants in Western Australia and San Francisco. But with
Australia and Mexico expected to be unable to satisfy future world demand
the company is seeking extra production capacity. Cargill has also been
given permission to build a Dollars 25m loading jetty, capable of loading
10,000 tonnes of salt a day, compared with loading capacity of 1,000 to
2,000 tonnes a day at other Gujarat docks.
The multinational's first obstacle was the strident objection to the project
by the Kandla Port Trust authorities, after experts had expressed concern
that salt farming and the operation of a private jetty would compound the
heavy silting problem that the port faced, posing a serious threat to the
functioning of the port. Despite the Gujarat state government's objections,
the surface transport ministry in Delhi insisted on allotting the land to
Cargill; the government even considered amending the Major Port Trusts Act
of 1963, which forbids the construction of private jetties in port areas, to
clear the way for the Cargill project.
The island of Satsaida Bet, created by a system of interconnected creeks, is
perfect for the setting up of salt pans, but the silting could cause major
technical and ecological problems. Earlier proposals from local salt
manufacturers to convert the area into salt pans have been rejected on the
ground that the port's master plan recommends that no commercial activity be
allowed on the island to conserve the hydrographic features needed for a
proposed Rs100m (Dollars 3.2m) tidal power project.
The Kutch Small Scale Manufacturers' Association, which is worried that the
advent of international competition will adversely affect its members (the
Gujarat-Kutch belt accounts for 80 per cent of the country's salt
production), has filed a case against Cargill Southeast Asia in the Kutch
civil court. They are supported by Mr George Fernandes, MP, who as minister
for industry, evicted US multinationals Coca Cola and IBM from India in
1977.
Mr Fernandes, a staunch socialist, accuses Cargill of being 'all set to take
over Kandla Port as its own private enterprise.' He points out that India
produces enough salt (14m tonnes) to meet its own domestic needs and has a
large export surplus that Cargill is free to market if it wishes. He argues
that Cargill's claim that it will provide employment to 2,000 local people
is spurious, considering the company, by its own admission, uses only 50
people to harvest double the amount of salt at its Australian plant.
'Allowing Cargill's proposal in Kandla implies exposing Kandla port to
foreign surveillance and jeopardising national security, reducing the income
of the port, preventing expansion of the port, and creating mass
unemployment in the region,' says Mr Fernandes.
The MP, who is supported by state government officials in Gujarat, and even
MPs from the ruling Congress (I) party, whose decision it was to grant
permission to Cargill, compares the May 17 agitation to Mahatma Gandhi's
historic salt march agitation in the same region more than 50 years ago,
which led to India's independence from British rule.
Cargill, in its court affidavit, has blamed vested interests for the
problems and charged that the salt manufacturers have dragged the case to
court 'with an ulterior motive to establish their monopoly in the
salt-manufacturing business'. The company, with world-wide sales of Dollars
50bn, has refuted allegations that its project is a threat to India's
security, and has submitted that the Indian government has already examined
the economic and environmental impact of the project before approving it.
The 127-year-old company, which, with its various subsidiaries, employs
66,000 people in more than 800 companies in 54 countries, says that it is
committed to developing countries, and has planned the entire Kutch project
'to generate the maximum possible employment to this backward area for its
development'.
And there would be more investments in future - Cargill is looking to the
Indian markets for further investment up to Dollars 50m, and has already
submitted a proposal to the Indian government for a Dollars 25m citric acid
plant. But Cargill's Indian plans will have to wait until the courts decide
what is best for India.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US demand boosts oil prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMAND FROM US refineries for North Sea oil pushed prices through the
important Dollars 19-a-barrel barrier this week as refiners went on a buying
spree.
Estimates by the International Energy Agency, the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development's oil monitoring body, of a rise in second
quarter demand yesterday underlined the bullish sentiment in the oil market.
The IEA said it expected demand to rise by 500,000 barrels a day in the
second quarter, or about 1.5 per cent, over the same period last year with
moderate gains expected in all regions.
In addition, the IEA estimated that production by Opec slipped to 24.1m b/d
in April from 24.4m b/d in March.
The second quarter is traditionally a time of weak oil demand when prices
decline. But last year, prices actually firmed towards the end of the period
and some buyers want to book their supplies in case that happens again.
'There are not many cargoes of wet crude left at the moment and refiners are
buying ahead of maintenance shutdowns in the North Sea in June,' said Mr
Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at Smith Barney.
North Sea prices were up 5 cents a barrel yesterday at Dollars 19.25 a
barrel.
The IEA said that Russian oil production averaged 7.24m b/d in the first
quarter, a fall of 14 per cent from the same period a year ago. But the
agency said in its latest monthly oil report, that monthly figures to March
confirm a slowing of the decline in Russian output.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese sales give copper price
another battering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VANCOUVER
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER PRICES took another battering yesterday as Chinese selling pushed
them down to Dollars 1,750 a tonne or 79.40 cents a lb on the London Metal
Exchange, their lowest for five and a half years.
The collapse in copper, the most heavily traded metal, has been swift and
dramatic. In the past month the price has plummeted by more than 19 per cent
from Dollars 2,170 a tonne or 98.45 cents a lb. At the begining of the year
it was about Dollars 2,400.
'The copper price has been far too high. In recessions metal prices should
go down. But speculative activity and nervousness about possible big
interruptions to supply kept copper high. Copper producers have been making
lots of money when in their cyclical business they should have been losing
money,' pointed out Mr Stephen Briggs, analyst at the Metals &amp; Minerals
Research Services consultancy organisation.
LME stocks had now built up to a nine-year peak of 392,325 tonnes to give a
buffer against disruptions, he added. Mr Briggs suggested copper producers
would suffer in the future because high prices had encouraged new capacity
so copper would not benefit as much as some other base metals as the world
economy recovered.
'That is not to say that the price will remain at 80 cents (a lb) or below
for the foreseeable future - it just won't see Dollars 1.50 as some have
been suggesting.'
Mr Briggs said copper prices were unlikely to fall much below 70 cents a lb
or Dollars 1,543 a tonne. 'The big issue now is whether there will be
production cuts. Some medium-sized and small producers in Australia and
Canada will be really hurting at today's prices. But we know from recent
experience in the aluminium, zinc and lead industries that people will stare
at terrible prices for a long time before taking any action.'
A key element in copper's fall has been the switch by the Chinese from being
big buyers of the metal to being substantial sellers. Mr Ted Arnold, analyst
at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, pointed out: 'Many
metal-using Chinese enterprises have become very cautious about their buying
programmes over the last few months because of the fall in their currency,
the renminbi, against the US dollar. This caution has fed through to the
Chinese merchants operating in the world market. They cannot hedge the
renminbi against the dollar and are increasingly restricting their purchases
to a hand-to-mouth basis.'
Copper for delivery in three months on the LME closed only slightly above
the day's low last night at Dollars 1,756 a tonne (79.7 cents a lb). In
sterling terms, three-month copper closed at Pounds 1,133.50 a tonne, down
Pounds 52.
Westmin Resources has declared force majeure on zinc and copper concentrates
from its Myra Falls mine as a result of a labour dispute, reports Reuter
from Vancouver. The Vancouver Island mine last year produced 68,000 tonnes
of copper concentrate and 59,000 tonnes of zinc concentrates.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: Gloomy day in Europe as Bundesbank holds
fast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER, PATRICK HARVERSON and PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT bond markets in continental Europe had a mainly gloomy day, with
both German and French futures losing roughly half a point.
Although no interest rate cuts had been expected from the Bundesbank after
its council meeting, a smattering of hope must have remained to create some
disappointment at the lack of movement.
The Bank of France did cut its intervention rate from 8.25 per cent to 8 per
cent. But, being just as expected, it failed to halt the decline.
After interest rate cuts totalling 75 basis points over the past couple of
weeks, one economist said the pace of change was likely to slow, with
perhaps another 25 basis points coming off by the end of the month.
Some profit-taking was seen behind the falls in the markets, and some
setting up of new short positions.
A report by France's state auditor forecasting a budget deficit of between
FFr320bn and FFr360bn this year - twice the level forecast by the last
government - acted as a reminder of the supply problems faced throughout
Europe.
The German futures contract fell from 95.17 to 94.64 during the day.
THE UK government bond market again traded sluggishly in the absence of
economic data and with attention turning to the next auction announcement, a
week away.
Declines tended to be a little smaller than in the continental European
markets. The 7 1/4 per cent bond due 1998 shed just over  1/4 point, the
10-year stock about  1/3 and the 8 3/4 per cent due 2017 just over 1/2 . The
gilt futures contract also shed about  1/2 to close at 103 3/4 .
Neither the Newbury parliamentary by-election nor the local authority
elections were expected to cause much of a stir as the market had accepted
that there would be Conservative losses.
THE ITALIAN government bond market proved an exception to the gloom - or
'not moody at all' as one wag put it - as it continued to recover from the
setback delivered on Wednesday by Moody's downgrading of the state's foreign
currency debt.
The BTP contract traded more than half a point ahead of Wednesday night's
close, itself an improvement on the initial reaction to the news
THE CZECH Republic is preparing to launch a second domestic treasury bond
issue for at least Kcs2bn (Dollars 70m), Patrick Blum writes. The bonds will
have a maturity of less than four years, and the sale will be by auction. An
initial issue for Kcs2.5bn was successfully launched in March.
The proceeds will be used to help finance the 1991 budget deficit, said Mr
Jiri Klumpar, Czech central bank financial markets director, according to
the Czech news agency CTK.
THE JAPANESE government bond market reopened at a higher level after the
Golden Week holidays, helped by the yen's buoyancy and the strengthening of
US Treasuries since last Friday.
The June futures contract firmed a little more in Tokyo, to close at 108.56,
about  3/4 points up on Friday's close.
In a quiet day's trading, the benchmark 145 issue due 2002 saw little change
during the day. It was yielding about 4.33 per cent, compared with 4.40 at
the end of last week.
There seemed little impetus to the market, which is waiting to see whether
the currency will break through the Y110-to-the-dollar barrier. Nor did
yesterday's decline in the Nikkei Average stock market index make any waves.
It was viewed as profit-taking rather than a downward trend.
US TREASURY prices were mixed in light trading yesterday as many investors
and dealers stayed on the sidelines until today's key April employment
report.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/4 at 104
1/16 , yielding 6.801 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was up  1/32 at 100 5/32 , yielding 3.776 per cent.
Trading during the day was quiet, with the market ignoring news that initial
claims for state unemployment insurance were unchanged in the final week of
April. The data gave no clue as to what today's April employment report will
reveal, and a reluctance to get involved until that data was released kept
trading subdued.
The lack of movement was also attributable to continued confusion over what
the Treasury's changes to its debt mix mean for the market. On Wednesday the
Treasury announced it would reduce the sale of long bonds, eliminate
seven-year note auctions and increase issuance of shorter-dated securities,
all to cut the government's interest costs.

FT  07 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Code of practice on stock
lending issued
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK Borrowing and Lending Committee, a body of market practitioners,
has issued a code of practice for lending and borrowing domestic and
international securities in the London market.
The guidelines have no regulatory force, but the Securities and Investment
Board is looking at ways of ensuring they are enforced, either by endorsing
the code or by making the guidelines rules. It is considering the issue as
part of its review of custody, which is nearing completion. A discussion
document will be published in the next month or so.
One reason for renewed regulatory interest in this area is that part of the
Maxwell fraud might have been prevented if enforceable rules on the
authorisation of stock-lending had been in place.
The code is based on existing practice, and covers areas such as gaining
Inland Revenue and regulatory approval, setting collateral, and seeking
proper authority.
It applies to borrowing and lending of both domestic and international
equities and bonds. The size of the stock-lending market in gilts is Pounds
8bn, while UK equities lending accounts for Pounds 2bn. International
securities lending is estimated at about another Dollars 10bn, consisting
mostly of international equities.
In the international bond market, the repo (repurchase agreement) market
tends to fulfil the same function as the stock-lending market.

FT  07 MAY 93 / International Bonds: SmithKline Beecham returns to the
Eurosterling sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROBOND market saw a flurry of new issues as borrowers tapped the
dollar, lira, sterling and D-mark sectors of the international capital
market.
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American drugs and consumer products group,
returned to the Eurosterling sector with a Pounds 100m, five-year deal.
The bonds, which have a coupon of 7.75 per cent, were priced to yield 64
basis points over the 7.25 per cent gilt due 1998.
Lehman Brothers, the lead manager, said the yield spread held steady. The
proceeds will be swapped into either floating-rate dollars or floating-rate
sterling to give funding at around Libor plus 5 basis points.
Other participants in the deal noted that some investors were rather
disappointed to see SmithKline Beecham returning to the Eurosterling sector.
'The yield spread for the latest deal is more attractive than the yield
spread of about 57 basis points which we are quoting for their existing
issue,' said one house.
SmithKline launched a 5 1/2 -year issue - the 8 1/8 per cent bond due
November 1998 - in January and then increased it in size in early April.
Eurofima, the rail equipment financing agency, launched a DM500m five-year
Eurobond with a 6.25 per cent coupon. Dresdner Bank, the lead manager, said
the issue was one of the largest D-Mark bonds to have been issued by this
particular triple-A borrower.
Dresdner claimed there was quite good demand for the bonds against the
backdrop of a weak bund market. The bonds were issued at a price of 101.35
and traded at between 99.67 and 99.72, or 'at fees'.
Also in the D-Mark sector, Europaische Hypothekenbank increased the size of
its reverse floating-rate note by DM100m to DM275m. The bonds pay a fixed
coupon of 7.75 per cent in the first two years, and a coupon of 12 5/8 minus
six-month DM Libor thereafter.
Deutsche Bank, the lead manager, said the deal was placed mainly with retail
investors in Germany.
Air Gulf has raised a Dollars 307m loan to finance the purchase of eight new
Airbuses, Reuter reports. The loan is managed by Banque Indosuez and
guaranteed by European export credit agencies.

FT  07 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Matif to launch five-year
French bond futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MATIF, the French futures exchange, plans to launch a futures contract
based on three to five-year French government bonds. The contract will start
trading on June 17.
The introduction of this latest French interest rate contract means that
dealers can now trade the whole of the French yield curve in the futures
market.
The Matif already lists a three-month Pibor interest rate contract, a seven
to 10-year bond contract, and a 15 to 30-year bond contract. However, the
30-year contract, launched on January 28, is hardly traded: average daily
volume in April was just 184 contracts, compared with 134,000 in the 10-year
'notionnel' contract.
'The five-year contract will have the same fate as the 30-year,' warned one
government bond trader.
An active forward market already exists in when-issued five-year BTANs,
which are sold at regular monthly auctions. According to some traders, this
assumes the function of a futures contract.
However, a Matif official said the new contract had been designed to offer
something different: it is based on three- to five-year BTANs and OATs with
total outstandings of FF231.48bn.
There has been growing trading interest in the shorter end of the yield
curve across a range of markets.
In the last few months, two new five-year contracts - a German government
bond (BOBL) contract on Liffe in London and an Italian government bond (BTP)
contract on Italy's Mif - have been launched.
However, a previous attempt to develop a five-year French bond contract
proved a failure.
In 1988, the Matif launched a five-year contract jointly with another
exchange, which never took off, and was killed the following year.
The Conseil du Marche a Terme has approved the latest launch.

FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: Hutchison raises HKDollars 4.5bn
</HEADLINE>

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUTCHISON Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing,
yesterday said it had raised HKDollars 4.5bn (USDollars 582m) through a
placement of 250m shares at HKDollars 18.3 each.
The company said the funds would be used to finance its expansion in China
and its telecommunications business in Britain. The placement was effected
at a 5 per cent discount to yesterday's closing price of HKDollars 19.3.
Mr Simon Murray, Hutchison's group managing director, said that on the
mainland the company had investments in port development in Shanghai,
Shenzhen and Zhuhai, as well as power station construction.
He said the funds would also be used in the UK where its 65 per cent owned
telecommunications subsidiary has a large capital expenditure programme.
Analysts estimate that Hutchison needs to spend more than Pounds 300m over
the next two years.
The Hong Kong business community has been expecting Hutchison to come to the
market for funds for some time. Cheung Kong, Mr Li's flagship in Hong Kong,
took 100m shares of the placement to maintain his 40 per cent interest in
the company; the remaining 150m shares were placed with investors.
The capital raising should help Hutchison's balance sheet. According to
Crosby Securities, Hutchison's net debt rose to HKDollars 13.1bn in 1992
from HKDollars 5.3bn in 1990.

FT  07 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Some long faces at shortening
of US debt mix - Success depends on short-term interest rates staying low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON WEDNESDAY, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, described his
decision to cut federal interest costs by shortening the maturity on
government securities as a 'carefully crafted, moderate move'.
That 'moderate move' consisted of halving the issuance of 30-year government
securities (through reducing the frequency of bond sales from one every
three months to one every six months), eliminating the seven-year note
altogether, and increasing the sale of securities with a maturity of three
years or less to make up the difference.
Although the bond market has taken the changes in its stride, the reaction
from some parts of Wall Street has been anything but moderate. Mr Michael
Basham, a former top Treasury official who now works for the securities firm
Smith Barney Shearson, described them as 'monumental' and said the
government could not guarantee the new policy would save money.
Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist with Nikko Securities, says the changes
are poorly-timed, and Mr Louis Crandall, chief economist at RH Wrightson,
called the idea of shortening the maturity on government debt now as a 'very
bad one'.
The Treasury is also likely to have incurred the wrath of the borrowing
committee of the Public Securities Association, which earlier this year
advised the government against making changes to the structure of the debt.
The committee felt the current debt mix was 'broadly appropriate'.
The Treasury has gone ahead with its reforms in spite of the committee's
reservations because it was determined to find a way to cut the cost of
financing the huge federal budget deficit. Over the years, various
governments have considered saving money by shortening the maturity on debt.
But the arrival of a new team at the Treasury after the Democrats' victory
in last year's presidential election increased the likelihood that talk
would turn into action.
The government, however, did not commit itself to making any changes until
February, when President Clinton announced in his first budget plans to save
about Dollars 16bn over the next five years through alterations to the
Treasury's debt mix. Once the president had promised these savings, it then
became a question of how far the Treasury would go in changing the mix. In
particular, would the 30-year long bond be phased out completely?
In the end, a compromise was struck between the politicians, who wanted to
aim for really big savings by eliminating the long bond altogether, and the
more cautious Treasury staffers, who were worried what effect that might
have on the bond market.
Although the Treasury has decided to stick with the long bond, there are
those on Wall Street who believe it is playing a dangerous game by altering
the debt maturities. As Mr Brusca of Nikko says: 'They claim they're doing
it to save money . . . yet it will take us 30 years to find out if the
three-month interest rate then is the same as the the 30-year rate we can
lock in now.'
The Treasury is at least guaranteed some immediate savings. It pays out
lower interest rates on shorter-dated securities than on longer-dated
securities so, by selling more of the former and less of the latter, it will
save some money over the next few years.
Yet, over the longer term, expecting further savings assumes that short-term
interest rates do not rise, or do not rise too far. This is an assumption
that many economists believe is dangerous, and one that the government
should not be making.
Mr Jim Fralick of Morgan Stanley says: 'I'm worried about the interest rate
risk and, if interest rates back up again, it will cost the government, and
the taxpayer, money in the long run.'
Wall Street also has reservations about the timing of the Treasury's move.
Economists argue that, with long-term interest rates at their lowest levels
in more than three decades, the government should be locking in these
extremely low rates now by selling more, not less, long bonds.
Moreover, critics worry that the size of the federal deficit means it is
folly for the Treasury to be reducing the number of financing vehicles
available to the government. In particular, if President Clinton does not
get his way with Congress over his deficit-reduction measures, 'we could be
looking at much bigger deficits and less ammunition in our holster to
finance them', says Mr Brusca.
Although the Treasury insists that it is changing the debt mix only to save
the government money, it is clear that a secondary aim is to bring down
long-term interest rates. By reducing the number of long bonds in
circulation, the Treasury hopes long-term interest rates will fall, making
it cheaper for US companies to raise long-term investment capital.
But Wall Street is not sure that cutting long-bond issuance will do the
trick alone. Economists warn that, without a credible deficit-reduction
package, long-term rates may not come down very far, or fast. As Mr Brusca
says: 'If you want interest rates to be lower, let's have a responsible
fiscal policy.'

April sales

<TEXT>
LEADING US store chains reported only a very modest recovery in sales last
month, despite better shopping conditions during April.
For many of the largest retailers, same-store sales gains in April were in
the low single digits - although most acknowledged this was an advance on
the March results, when severe winter storms hit much of the country.
Nevertheless, the results were quickly seen as reinforcing the notion that
economic recovery was slow and patchy in the US.
Among the big discount chains, for example, K mart reported a 2.8 per cent
same-store sales advance in its general merchandise division and a 3.4 per
cent decline for the specialty chains.
The company said the lift in sales, over the March figures, was 'most
pronounced in hardline merchandise categories', although it noted clothing
sales had been dampened by the cool weather.
Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's top-selling retailer, reported 6 per cent
growth in like-for-like sales.
At Sears, Roebuck, sales on a like-for-like basis rose by 5 per cent, with
the strongest improvements coming in clothing, footwear, fine jewellery,
home office equipment and some garden items.
But Woolworth saw a 2.3 per cent fall in same-store sales, causing Mr Harold
Sells, chairman, to blame 'weak economic conditions and low consumer
confidence'.
The picture among department stores was similar. May Department Stores
reported a 2.3 per cent advance in same-store sales last month, while
Federated - which takes Abraham &amp; Straus and Bloomingdale's - managed a 2.2
per cent advance.
Among the more specialised retailers, The Gap - the once high-flying fashion
chain - reported only a 2 per cent advance in same-store sales, while The
Limited said like-for-like sales were flat.

NEDCOR, South Africa's fourth-largest bank, yesterday reported a 22 per cent
increase in net income to R234m (Dollars 74m) for the six months to March
1993. The interim dividend is to be increased.
The result was achieved despite heavier provisions. Mr Chris Liebenberg,
chief executive, said the bank has reacted to the volatile operating
environment by making generous risk provisions and by not taking the full
benefit of various deferred tax benefits. This was a time to be
conservative, he said
The weak state of the South African economy was reflected in an 8 per cent
decline in interest income to R3.1bn, a function of lower-than-expected
volumes and declining interest rates. Net interest income rose 11 per cent
to R881m. Other income improved by 22 per cent to R574m.
Specific and general risk provisions rose by 33 per cent to R120m (R90m). Mr
Liebenberg conceded that, if current trends continued, the bank would have
over-provided for the loan book of the Perm, the group's home loan arm, and
some provisions would be returned to capital.
He presented figures to show that concern about the Perm's exposure to
lending in segregated black townships - described as a very difficult market
 -were misplaced. Perm advances represented 22 per cent of group assets,
while and township advances were 5 per cent of the total. He said only 0.15
per cent of group assets were in arrears.
The increase in provisions was partly offset by a modest 2 per cent increase
in the tax bill to R167m.
Shareholders who prefer can elect to receive a cash dividend of 25 cents per
share, a 19 per cent increase over 1992.

VOLVO, the Swedish motor vehicle group, suffered a further blow to its
prestige yesterday when Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, cut
the company's short-term debt rating from A-1 to A-2.
The move had been signalled in March when the rating was placed under review
for possible downgrade, following the publication of the group's 1992
result. This showed a SKr4.75bn (Dollars 650m) loss after financial items,
compared with a SKr1.5bn profit in 1991, and an increased operating loss of
SKr2.25bn.
S&amp;P said it was downgrading the group because of Volvo's continuing poor
operating performance and the weakening of its balance sheet after net debt
rose last year to SKr13bn from SKr7bn. 'Given the generally difficult
trading environment for the automotive industry, debt reduction is expected
to be constrained over the near term,' it added.
The rating agency also pointed to a number of positive factors, including
the company's cost-cutting campaign, and the expected recovery in its two
principal European markets, the UK and Sweden, in the next two to three
years.

FORD Motor Company of Australia has reduced substantially its losses for
1992 after returning to the black in the second half of the year.
The company yesterday declared a ADollars 38.3m (USDollars 27.2m) net loss
for last year, against a ADollars 113.8m loss in 1991 - the third
consecutive loss for Ford, one of four local carmakers.
Mr John Ogden, president, said yesterday sales rose 8 per cent to ADollars
2.5bn last year and that the company had traded at a profit for the first
quarter of 1993 after leaving the red in the half to December 1992.
Mr Ogden said this was achieved despite market weakness in Australia as well
as in the US, Ford Australia's main export market.
He said Ford had lifted its total Australian market share from 18.9 per cent
to 19.7 per cent in the first quarter of 1993 and expected industry sales to
increase by about 2 per cent this year.
Pacific BBA, the Australian plastics and car parts maker formerly controlled
by BBA Group of the UK, plans to acquire Webforge (Singapore) from
Prudential Asia for about Dollars 44m.
Webforge is Australia's dominant maker of steel gratings with annual sales
of about Dollars A40m. The company also has operations in Singapore, New
Zealand and China.
Pacific BBA said the acquisition would provide the nucleus of a new building
and construction division which would complement the company's automotive
components and industrial plastics operations.

<TEXT>
VARD, the Norwegian cruise and ferry group, yesterday unveiled a debt
restructuring package which should secure the survival of its troubled
Miami-based Kloster Cruise unit.
The package aims to reduce the heavy financial pressure which has been
weighing on Kloster for more than a year, by extending its debt maturity
profile to about six years from three years.
It will also allow Kloster to re-focus on improving earnings from cruise
operations.
Kloster agreed the deal with a group of qualified institutional investors
who are to take up Dollars 300m of senior, secured 10-year notes with a 13
per cent coupon.
The notes were secured against mortgages on two of the company's 12-strong
cruise ship fleet.
Vard's shares closed NKr2 down at NKr25.50 on the Oslo bourse yesterday on
news of the highly-priced debt.
The company has an option to redeem the notes in whole or in part, on or at
the beginning of the sixth year at redemption rates starting at 105 per cent
and declining thereafter.
The issue, which closes on May 12, was sold by Salomon Brothers and the
First Boston Corporation to the limited number of investors, who were warned
that Kloster was likely to suffer a loss for 1993.
The unit lost Dollars 12.6m in the first quarter, against a loss of Dollars
2.7m last year. With the group's Scandi and Larvik ferry lines suffering
losses, the Vard group plunged to a loss of Dollars 18.7m in the first
quarter of this year.
Vard said yesterday the note and new agreements establishing long-term
credit to replace existing short-term facilities would enable the company to
meet debt servicing requirements of Dollars 230m in 1993.
Total interest-bearing debt is estimated at Dollars 1bn, while annual
interest payments are set to rise by an estimated Dollars 10m to Dollars
80m.
Another part of the package calls for conversion of the company's French
franc debt into dollar debt.
Vard said talks were continuing with a group of investors led by a Vard
board member, on the disposal of the ferry operations. The company hoped to
conclude the talks by the end of the month.

FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: Imasco sees growth in earnings

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IMASCO, the Canadian financial services, tobacco, fast-food and retailing
group, expects 'reasonably good growth' in earnings for 1993 in spite of a
slow first half, said Mr Purdy Crawford, chairman.
The second quarter would be tough, he added, but the second half of 1993
would be healthier.
The company's performance would be affected by loan provisions made by
Canada Trust, the financial services arm, which along with Imperial Tobacco
were Imasco's biggest subsidiaries. The group is 40 per cent held by BAT
Industries of the UK.
Imasco's first-quarter profit was up 5 per cent, but CT's contribution was
reduced by the provisions.
'CT is highly conservative in its provisions and has retained its top credit
rating right through the recession,' Mr Crawford added. He said that the
retailing side had been under pressure but should improve in the second
half. In addition, the improvement at Hardee's, the US fast-food chain, was
continuing.
Imasco's share of the Canadian legal cigarette market was 67 per cent and it
was resuming normal exports after complying with a federal request for
restraint in 1992.
Mr Crawford said that increased smuggling in tobacco products was due to
high Canadian taxes. The restraint reduced Imasco's exports but failed to
affect contraband traffic because smugglers found cigarettes from other
sources.
Imasco has made a deal for Philip Morris to market Canadian-made cigarettes
in the US.

Realised investment gains were significantly higher this time, at Dollars

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPUTER software battle has erupted between Sun Microsystems, the leading
manufacturer of computer workstations, and Microsoft, the world's largest
computer software company.
Sun has challenged Microsoft's dominant position in the software market by
announcing the joint development with Unix Systems Laboratories of
technology allowing Unix computers to run word processing, spreadsheet and
database applications designed for use on personal computers running
Microsoft's Windows operating system.
Sun said its new technology, known as Wabi and based on work by Praxsys
Technologies, would enable Unix system users to run Microsoft Windows
applications 'right out of the box'.
Until now this could be done only by using a software 'emulator' that acted
like a personal computer, degrading the performance of a Unix computer.
Sun claimed that, through Wabi, the performance of Unix computers running
Windows applications would be about 50 per cent higher than other computers
using the Microsoft's Windows operating system.
Sun's move is a pre-emptive attack on Microsoft's imminent high-performance
version of Windows, known as Windows NT.
Microsoft has announced it would also offer programmes enabling Windows
applications to run on Unix computers and Apple's Macintosh machines.
Microsoft questioned Sun's performance claims for Wabi. Mr Bill Gates,
chairman and chief executive, also said Microsoft would check Wabi for any
infringement of intellectual property rights.
However, Sun argued that Wabi technology, which would be available to
software developers in about 90 days, contained no Microsoft technology.

FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: Chase Manhattan to spin off HK
credit-card unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our New York Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHASE Manhattan, the big New York bank engaged in a wide-ranging
restructuring programme, is to spin off its Hong Kong credit-card operation.
Mr James Brew, senior vice-president of Chase Manhattan Bank, said yesterday
that an application had been filed with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. He did
not say how much would be raised through an initial public offering.
The money raised would be used, he said, to feed the bank's expanding Visa
Cards and Mastercards operation, which has grown by more than 30 per cent
annually for the past two years.
Chase had more than 300,000 cards in use in Hong Kong in December, Mr Brew
said. This accounted for 14 per cent of the local market share. In terms of
accounts receivable, the bank had an 18 per cent share.
In an attempt to step up the expansion of its credit-card operations, he
said the bank was in talks with potential partners which might take a stake
in the division in a pre-listing placement.
The bank is also arranging a Dollars 220m syndication loan, which will be
used as funding for the card operation as a result of a separation of assets
and liabilities with the bank after the listing.
The flotation will be jointly sponsored by Chase Manhattan Asia, its
merchant banking arm, and SG Warburg (Securities). Peregrine Brokerage will
act an an underwriter.
For 1992, the Hong Kong operation reported a rise of more than 33 per cent
in profits in excess of HKDollars 100m (USDollars 12.9m) on turnover of
HKDollars 450m. Last month Chase group as a whole reported higher
first-quarter earnings and announced plans to raise Dollars 750m of new
equity capital while also writing off Dollars 1bn of commercial property
loans.

FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: Speculators warm to SE Banken -
Hugh Carnegy reports on the rush to buy shares in the Swedish bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IT reported a hefty quarterly loss, its loan losses remain large and
brokers, analysts and even the bank's chief executive have been counselling
caution all week.
But still the rush to buy stock in Scandinaviska Enskilda Banken continued
yesterday, pushing the price of its most-traded A shares up to SKr28, more
than 3.5 times its value 10 days ago.
After first-quarter results from Sweden's four principal commercial banks
all showed a marked improvement over the tide of red ink last year, many
investors decided the corner had been turned in the country's painful
banking crisis.
Few who study the sector closely are prepared to state outright that is the
case. Nor is it yet clear what level of state support SE Banken, the biggest
of the four, has requested from the government to help it recapitalise.
A large element in the rise in SE Banken shares has been a gambler's
attraction to their hitherto rock-bottom price and the lack of an
alternative.
Gotabank and Nordbanken are in government hands and unquoted.
Shares in Svenska Handelsbanken, the least hard hit by a slew of loan losses
deriving mostly from the crippled commercial property sector, have long
since recovered from their lows to about SKr90.
So those who wanted to be in for the anticipated recovery have jumped into
SE Banken this week - forcing the bank to bring forward publication of its
quarterly report by a week.
How strong is the evidence of a turnround? A feature of the quarterly
results has been a clear improvement in the banks' underlying earnings.
Handelsbanken, which will report its full quarterly figures next week, has
reported preliminary results showing an overall profit of more than SKr350m
(Dollars 48m) in the first three months and a 30 per cent rise in profits
before loan losses to SKr2.2bn.
SE Banken's operating profit before loan losses was up no less than 60 per
cent to SKr2.3bn. In spite of its large burden of non-performing loans, net
interest earnings were up 14 per cent at SKr2.16bn. The improvement helped
it cut its overall operating loss by 55 per cent to SKr608m.
Nevertheless, Mr Bjorn Svedberg, SE Banken's chief executive, was
sufficiently alarmed by the speculative boom in his bank's shares to warn
investors not to read too much into the results.
'Great uncertainty' still surrounded the full-year picture, he said.
Although SE Banken's SKr24.6bn portfolio of non-performing loans was down
from the year-end figure of almost SKr29bn, the levels of negotiated
interest deferments and non-paid interest on non-performing loans was well
ahead of the same period last year.
The banking sector as a whole is still expected to show a loss for the full
year, albeit not as bad as in 1992.
As Mr Svedberg pointed out, what the banks needed above all for a sustained
recovery was an upturn in the Swedish economy, which was still locked in
recession and expected to post a third consecutive year of negative gross
national product.
The banks are benefitting from a fall in Swedish interest rates, with the
key marginal rate down to 9.25 per cent from the double figures of last
year.
Some analysts remain worried that rising unemployment and falling property
values could yet trigger another round of losses for the banks, this time in
the household sector.
So, although there is clearly some improvement, the Swedish banks are still
far from a full recovery - and the government cannot yet draw a line under
the SKr67.5bn it has already provided them in state support.

FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: American Express to pay SKr865m
for travel agent

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Express is making its biggest-ever purchase within travel-related
services through a SKr865m (Dollars 115m) deal to buy Nyman &amp; Schultz, the
leading Swedish business travel agency.
The US group has agreed to buy 70 per cent of the company from its three
largest shareholders while making an offer for the rest of the shares, which
are largely owned by management and employees.
It said the move would expand its European travel business as Nyman &amp;
Schultz has a strong presence in the Swedish, Norwegian and UK markets.
It would also strengthen its ties with international corporate customers as
Nyman has a strong relationship with many leading Swedish multinationals.
Mr Jonathan Linen, president of American Express Travel Related Services,
said in New York yesterday that the Swedish company would be a natural fit
with the US group. The deal meant American Express was now well placed to
take advantage of the deregulation in the European airline industry.
He said the group would like to be stronger in Europe and would continue to
look for opportunities to expand not only in Europe but in other regions
such as eastern Asia and Latin America.
Nyman &amp; Schultz, which will continue to operate as a separate company after
the acquisition, achieved a profit after financial items of SKr96m last year
on turnover of SKr7.3bn. It has around 200 offices and 1,700 employees.
A sale of the group had been rumoured for some time because of the desire of
its three main Swedish shareholders to dispose of their stakes.
The biggest shareholder, NCC, with a 28.9 per cent stake, had made clear it
wanted to concentrate on its core property and construction business.
The US group has more than 1,700 offices in 120 countries. Last month, the
group's Travel Related Services division reported a 68 per cent rise in
first-quarter net income to Dollars 211m. Revenues fell by 5.6 per cent to
Dollars 2.34bn.

FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: Philips head denies that sale
was to raise cash

<TEXT>
MR Jan Timmer, president of Philips, the Dutch electronics group, denied
yesterday that the company's decision to end its semiconductor joint venture
with Matsushita of Japan was motivated primarily by the need to raise cash
in order to reduce debts.
Speaking at the annual meeting, Mr Timmer said the price of Fl 3bn (Dollars
1.68bn) was 'not unwelcome but it was not our main goal'.
He gave no details but said the partnership, which dates back to 1952, had
been in need of revision. He also noted that Philips' 35 per cent stake in
the joint venture, Matsushita Electronics Corp, had not entitled the Dutch
company to management control.
Mr Timmer, denying that the divestment was an abrupt decision, said Philips
started considering pulling out of MEC two years ago.
Philips has declined to be drawn on the book profit that it will realise on
the sale of its MEC shares to Matsushita, which will now assume 100 per cent
control. 'This windfall will help put us on the road to recovery, (but) the
road to recovery is still long,' Mr Timmer said.
He gave no forecast for 1993 results or the likelihood of a resumption of
dividend payments, but repeated earlier predictions that the company's
single biggest business, consumer electronics, would reach break-even in
1994.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HOCHTIEF, one of Germany's largest construction companies, demonstrated how
the building sector is defying Germany's economic gloom as it announced
yesterday that net profits rose 42 per cent to DM284m (Dollars 180m) last
year.
Mr Hans-Peter Keitel, chief executive, said the downturn in the economy had
started to have an effect on business in western Germany. But, he said, this
was more than outweighed by the construction boom in the east of the
country.
Describing the 1992 result as 'exceptionally pleasing,' Mr Keitel said that
Hochtief could continue to be confident about the future. Earnings for the
first four months of the current year were at the same high level as in the
same period last year and he expected full-year earnings for 1993 to match
the 1992 result.
Orders climbed 7.3 per cent to DM8.6bn last year, a modest change which
conceals a 32 per cent increase in domestic orders and a 35 per cent drop in
orders outside Germany.
Despite Mr Keitel's optimism about the future, he expressed scepticism about
the government's ability to attract investment into eastern Germany.
Hochtief is majority-owned by RWE, the Ruhr-based energy conglomerate, but a
minority of its shares is listed.

FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: Sale of Procordia faces delay
until next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIVATISATION of Procordia, the Swedish pharmaceuticals and consumer
products group, may be delayed until next year, according to Mr Jan Ekberg,
managing director.
The sale of the Swedish government's 40 per cent stake, expected later this
year, was postponed due to poor market conditions.
Recently, Procordia's position in the privatisation queue has slipped
following the government's decision to give priority to the sale of the
Celsius defence equipment group later this year. As a result, Procordia's
privatisation 'will probably be postponed until next year,' said Mr Ekberg.
However, the potential delay could help the deal, as it would give Procordia
more time to digest Farmitalia Carlo Erba, the Italian pharmaceuticals group
being merged with its Kabi Pharmacia subsidiary, he argued.
The joint unit will be the world's 18th-biggest pharmaceuticals company,
with sales of about Dollars 3.6bn. The two companies will be among the
market leaders in a number of niche areas such as clinical nutrition, growth
hormones, oncology and cardio-vascular drugs.
The expansion in Procrodia's pharmaceuticals activities should make the
group 'easier to privatise,' said Mr Ekberg. In spite of the recent downturn
in investor interest in pharmaceutical stocks, Procordia should be more
attractive and command a higher price once FCE has been digested, he
claimed.
Procordia agreed to buy 51 per cent of FCE from Italy's Montedison in March.
The Swedish company also has an option, almost certain to be exercised, to
buy the remaining shares by 1995.
The acquisition will reinforce Kabi Pharmacia's position in the increasingly
competitive pharmaceuticals business, particularly at a time of rising
pressure on prices. The merger will boost research spending to about Dollars
500m, create a much stronger manufacturing base and boost the two companies'
marketing presence, said Mr Hakan Astrom, Kabi Pharmacia's chief executive.
However, Procordia is clearly interested in expanding further into
pharmaceuticals. Although Mr Ekberg said no big takeovers were being
planned, he left open the door to 'smaller strategic acquisitions in certain
areas'.
The group, which will now be among the leaders in Italy, Sweden and Spain,
is particularly keen to strengthen its role in the US and Japan, where it is
still weak.
While much of its expansion will come from organic growth of existing
activities, it is also looking at potential alliances or complementary
acquisitions. A first visible step towards integrating its growing
international operations will come with the choice of a new name, to replace
Kabi Pharmacia Farmitalia Carlo Erba, probably by the autumn.

FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: IRI holding in SME will be 5%
after sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company, will lower its stake in SME
foods, the retailing and catering subsidiary, to 5 per cent from 62 per cent
after the group's food production activities are sold in the coming weeks.
IRI is in the closing stages of disposing of SME's Italgel (frozen foods)
and Cirio, Bertolli, De Rica (canned foods and edible oils) activities.
Buyers for the two operations may be revealed within the next month.
The government's privatisation plans also envisage a sharp and speedy
reduction in IRI's share in SME's remaining food retailing and catering
operations.
Retailing, conducted by the GS supermarkets chain, accounted for L2,509bn
(Dollars 1.71bn) of SME's L5,814bn group sales in 1991, while the Autogrill
catering unit had sales of L1,011bn.
In a two-stage transaction, IRI plans to sell 32 per cent of its 62 per cent
stake in the retailing and catering operations to a 'hard core' of
shareholders, which will have around 5 per cent each.
In line with Italy's new takeover code, the 'hard core' will then be obliged
to launch a public tender offer for a further 32 per cent.
IRI will then be able to offer its remaining shares to the 'hard core' under
the offer. Any shares left in its hands above the 5 per cent level will be
placed on the market, after giving SME's workforce special pre-election
rights.
The deal could be followed by a further sale of SME stock from the 'hard
core'. Under the government's complex SME privatisation rules, the 'hard
core', including IRI, will not be allowed to pool more than 50 per cent of
its stock in a shareholders' pact.
As the combined holding of the 'hard core' and IRI will amount to 69 per
cent of the capital, it is possible the additional shares will also be sold.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Statoil the Norwegian state oil company, boosted first-quarter net profit to
NKr1.2bn (Dollars 179m) from NKr605m last year, helped by higher oil prices,
cost reductions and a substantially improved financial result.
The group warned of a 'rather lower' second quarter, with uncertainty
attached to earnings by petrochemical and refining operations and to oil
prices in the short and long term. Group revenue rose by NKr1.8bn to
NKr20.8bn as operating profit increased to NKr3.4bn from NKr2.9bn. Statoil
said net financial revenue in the first quarter reached NKr653m, compared
with net charges of NKr999bn in last year's comparative period.
Mr Morten Woldsdal, a Statoil executive, said the value of the group's bonds
and shares rose by NKr100m in the first quarter, while other financial
instruments contributed about NKr500m to income.
The group also had NKr1bn in unrealised foreign exchange gains. The price of
benchmark Brent crude averaged Dollars 18.23 a barrel in the quarter, up
from Dollars 17.94 last year.
Mr Woldsdal said that because of harsh weather in January, the company had
to postpone its exploration and North Sea platform maintenance programmes
until the second quarter. As a result, associated exploration and
maintenance costs would be charged against second-quarter accounts.
He said the group would not feel the full effect of several major cost
reduction programmes implemented last year until 1995 and 1996, after which
costs will have been reduced by an estimated NKr2.6bn.

FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: Minister rejects Creditanstalt
bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUSTRIAN finance minister has rejected a proposal by the Raiffeisen
co-operative bank group to acquire a controlling interest in Creditanstalt,
the country's second-largest commercial bank.
Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the minister, said the bid was badly prepared and that
its leaders were unwilling to reveal the sources of their funds. Mr Lacina
said he was not willing to play 'children's games' with them.
The Austrian government has a 70 per cent voting stake in Creditanstalt.
The bid, launched late last week, has been vigorously opposed by the
chairman of Creditanstalt's supervisory board, its executive board and
employees' representatives.
Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari, executive chairman, said the terms of the bid - a
reverse takeover financed by roughly Sch5bn (Dollars 449m) in debt - would
have undermined Creditanstalt's capital base.
He also said that many Creditanstalt commercial customers were upset because
co-operatives associated with the Raiffeisen were among their main
competitors.
The bid was seen in Austrian financial circles as a largely political
gesture, an attempt to put together a banking group with close links to the
conservative Austrian People's Party that would rival Bank Austria in size.
Bank Austria, itself the product of a merger of two banks in September 1991,
has close ties with the Social Democratic Party.
Yesterday's outburst by Mr Lacina followed a meeting with Mr Schmidt-Chiari
and Mr Christian Konrad and Mr Klaus Liebscher, chairman and director
general respectively of the Raiffeisen Zentralbank.
The outcome leaves Mr Rudolf Gruber, deputy chairman of the Creditanstalt
supervisory board, in an awkward position. It has emerged that Mr Gruber,
who is also chief executive of Energie Versorgung Niederosterreich, an
energy utility, was involved in preparing the Raiffeisen bid, but did not
inform his colleagues at Creditanstalt.
Mr Schmidt-Chiari denied suggestions that Creditanstalt, which has had to
make heavy loan loss provisions in the past two years, was looking for a
white knight.
However, the government has been searching for strategic partners for the
bank, and last autumn there were contacts with General Electric of the US.
Mr Schmidt-Chiari has said he would prefer to see the government's stake
dispersed among institutional investors.
'Certainly, we can stay independent,' he said, pointing to a 47 per cent
rise in operating profits in the first quarter.

FT  07 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Costain in housing sale talks - Several
potential purchasers involved, but no offer made as yet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COSTAIN, the heavily borrowed UK construction group, has received approaches
from several potential purchasers for its loss-making UK housebuilding
operations.
The company confirmed yesterday that talks had taken place, but said it had
still to receive an offer for the business.
Up to half a dozen companies are though to be interested, including Redrow,
the privately-owned housebuilder and construction group.
Mr Steve Morgan, Redrow's chairman, declined to comment on the speculation,
but his company is thought to have been given until next week to submit a
formal offer for the UK housebuilding operations.
Costain needs the money to reduce its large borrowings.
It recently sold its Australian mining operations to Peabody Resources, part
of Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, in a deal worth Pounds 198m.
Despite this, Costain still had borrowings of almost Pounds 153m at the
beginning of April, equivalent to 96 per cent of shareholders' funds.
Mr Peter Costain, chief executive of the company, which incurred a Pounds
149m pre-tax loss last year, wants to reduce its involvement in UK
housebuilding to concentrate on its core businesses of UK and international
construction and US coal mining.
It has made no secret of the fact that it would sell the UK housing
operations at the right price.
Costain's residential and commercial property businesses last year reported
an operating loss of Pounds 7.1m, against a Pounds 14.6m deficit in 1991.
The value of its housing land was written down by a further Pounds 49.5m,
following sharp falls in house prices.
The company owns about 2,000 housing sites, with an average value, after
write-downs, of Pounds 11,000 each. This would indicate a sale value for the
UK housing operations of between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m.
Last year slightly more than 400 homes were built, with an average selling
price of Pounds 57,000, generating annual turnover of almost Pounds 23m.
The recent improvement in house sales has encouraged a revival in interest
in acquisitions and purchases of land by housebuilders wishing to expand
their operations.
This is thought to have prompted the flurry of interest in Costain's housing
operations, which operate in south-east England. They suffered as a result
of investing heavily in land in the late 1980s as the housing market moved
into recession.

A strong performance in the second half returned Laser-Scan Holdings to

A FURTHER decline at Copymore in the second half saw profits for 1992
reduced by 48 per cent from Pounds 1.02m to Pounds 536,000 before tax. This
followed the first half slip from Pounds 606,000 to Pounds 506,000.
In view of the profit drop, the USM-quoted office automation and equipment
distributor has not paid a final dividend. This leaves the year's total at
1p, against 2.7p.
Sales rose to Pounds 30.4m (Pounds 28.4m). Earnings were lower at 3.3p
(5.9p).
The company said that there were 'recessionary conditions in our core
photocopier and laser printer markets.'
As a result of a Pounds 482,000 downward revaluation of freehold property
and writing off almost Pounds 700,000 in acquisition goodwill, the year-end
debt-equity ratio increased to 184 per cent

FT  07 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Simple choice, hard decision - Maggie Urry
on today's meeting to settle the future of C&amp;J Clark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS of C&amp;J Clark, the private shoe company, gathering today at the
Royal Bath &amp; West of England Showground, must decide the future of their 168
year old company.
The choice before them is simple. But the decision is far from easy.
They must choose whether to accept a proposed Pounds 184m bid from Berisford
International, a virtual shell company keen to buy itself a core business,
or retain ownership in the hope that the company can find a solution to its
undoubted problems.
The meeting - at a venue more used to cattle shows than corporate showdowns
 -is bound to be stormy.
Emotions run high when Clark's shareholders, of which about 70 per cent are
members of the founding family, discuss the family business.
Put simply, the argument within the family has been whether to stick with
the tradition of a family-controlled and run company or to bring in
professional managers who might adopt a more ruthless business approach.
Since Berisford's bid appeared the alternative to family control and
ownership has become a sale of the business.
Berisford, claims Mr Alan Bowkett, its chief executive, 'is the solution not
the problem'. If the Berisford offer is rejected, he has all but said Clark
may go bust.
Shareholders against the sale, who have rallied around a standard raised by
a group calling itself Shoes, say Berisford is exaggerating the company's
problems and the shareholder's disharmony.
While the Clarks have been arguing, profits have slumped, and dividends cut.
From a pre-tax and exceptionals profit of Pounds 36.1m in 1989-90 the figure
dropped to Pounds 14.2m before exceptional costs of Pounds 12.5m in the
financial year to January 31. The dividend has been reduced from 9.38p to
3.75p over the last two years.
Years of disagreement culminated last October in an acrimonious
shareholders' meeting which only ended with an agreement that the board
would assess possible bids for the company.
That process produced the Berisford offer, which the board has described as
'fair and reasonable'. Seven of the 11 directors have recommended it to
shareholders.
Berisford is offering 213p per share in cash or securities. On top of that
is the promise of another 26p cash as and when Clark's surplus properties
are sold. The deferred element depends on the prices obtained and is based
on the January 31 book value.
That price has attractions given Clark's recent profit and dividend record,
and the price at which shareholders have been able to sell through an
internal market. The last trade was at 90p and the latest valuation is 100p.
Further, the Clark directors who recommend the bid assert that it takes
account of management forecasts of a recovery in profits over the next three
years.
Shoes argues that the Berisford offer fails to recognise Clark's potential,
although Shoes has not seen the three-year profit plan. And Clark's
supposedly divided board, they say, has implemented a reorganisation plan.
Rather than accept Berisford's offer, Shoes proposes a new structure for
Clark of a board and a shareholder council. And it suggests a flotation
within five years.
In response, Berisford says that a two-tier structure would foster rather
than heal divisions. And a vague promise of a flotation is uncertain
compared to cash in hand.
Shoes could have trumped Berisford if it had promised to match Berisford's
offer and keep the business within family control.
'They should put up or shut up,' said one stockbroker.
But it is in no position to do that. If shareholders reject Berisford's
approach, they must ask themselves what guarantee they have that Clark will
not revert to the divisions which have weakened its business.

FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: Smurfit falls to IPounds 95.5m
as weak prices take toll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JEFFERSON SMURFIT, the Irish paper and packaging group, yesterday announced
a sharp fall in profits due to recession and weak prices in several of its
main markets.
Pre-tax profits fell from IPounds 157.5m to IPounds 95.5m (Pounds 93.8m) in
the year to January 31 on turnover up 3 per cent at IPounds 1.26bn. At the
interim stage, profits fell 20 per cent to IPounds 60m.
Mr Ray Curran, chief financial officer, said the results showed 'a very
solid performance. We're looking forward to an upturn in the cycle'.
Trading profits dropped to IPounds 102.9m (IPounds 133.2m). Net interest
receivable increased to IPounds 16.2m (IPounds 15.3m), while net cash fell
to IPounds 149.5m (IPounds 238.8m).
Operating profits in Latin America increased 3 per cent to IPounds 63.2m.
The region increased its share of overall profits from 43 per cent to 59 per
cent, as European profits fell and North America turned from a profit to a
loss.
Ireland maintained operating profits at IPounds 19.4m, although profits in
the UK fell sharply from IPounds 13.6m to IPounds 4.71m. However, orders
have since improved and the company achieved a small price increase at the
year end.
JSC/CCA, the US associate which was set up through a leveraged buy-out in
1989, suffered from falling prices despite higher sales. JSC, which also
released first quarter results yesterday, reported a net loss up from
Dollars 19.9m to Dollars 32m (Pounds 20.7m).
Exceptional charges of IPounds 28.4m covered the cost of closing down some
European mills. There was also an extraordinary charge of IPounds 19.3m to
cover refinancing costs for JSC/CCA. Some of these costs were incurred after
the year end, but have been included in last year's results.
Earnings fell from 24.4p to 11.8p per share. A proposed final dividend of
2.5094p makes a total of 3.74p, an increase of 5.7 per cent.

FT  07 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Managers buy Benjamin Priest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BENJAMIN PRIEST, the engineering components group, has been bought by its
management from International Marine Holdings, the US group which won
control in December 1990 after paying Pounds 59.3m to settle a contested
takeover.
Mr John Ainsworth, the managing director and leader of the management
buy-out team, refused to disclose the purchase price but said the buy-out
was on a similar scale to that of the Leyland Daf van plant last month. This
transaction, which included Pounds 8m of public sector finance, drew in
funding of about Pounds 45m.
The Priest deal excludes Lewmar, the marine equipment company which was the
original target for International Marine. The US group made clear in 1990
that it would dispose of the engineering companies and a decision to that
effect was made nine months ago.
KPMG Corporate Finance put together the finance for the buy-out. This is
split roughly equally between equity, with the main shareholders being 3i
and NatWest Ventures, and borrowing from Lloyds Corporate Banking.
There are 12 engineering companies in the Priest group. Although investment
during the recession has been maintained above depreciation levels, their
operations have been slimmed down. The companies employ 1,085 people.
In the 1992 year the companies subject to the buy-out produced combined
turnover of Pounds 60m and made profits of Pounds 3m before tax, interest
charges and fees to International Marine.

FT  07 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Sullivan sells 10% stake in BEP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID Sullivan, publisher of the Sunday Sport, has sold his 10 per cent
stake in the Bristol Evening Post.
Credit Lyonnais Laing, the securities house, placed Mr Sullivan's 1.64m
shares with two institutions at an average price of 334p a share raising
some Pounds 5.48m.
The sale might be seen as a concession of defeat for Mr Sullivan's ambitions
to move into mainstream newspapers. The shares were bought for about 300p
each some three years ago and the sale is unlikely to have generated a
profit once carrying costs and brokers fees are taken into consideration.
That concession was signalled in early March when he and Ms Karren Brady,
the Sport's marketing director, announced that they were moving into
football. They head a company called Roldvale which bought 84 per cent of
Birmingham City Football Club for an undisclosed sum.
Mr Sullivan, who made his fortune through the sale of a string of sex shops
in 1981, built up his stake in the middle-market BEP in late 1989 and early
1990.
He was subsequently blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission from
taking a controlling stake in the tabloid. The MMC ruled that his ownership
would not be in the public interest.
However, as recently as last November, Mr Sullivan said he planned to fight
the ruling after buying The News and Echo, a new regional Sunday newspaper
for Yorkshire and north-west England. He was hoping that control of more
conventional newspapers would alter his case.
Mr Sullivan yesterday refused to make any comment regarding the sale.

FT  07 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Bellway advances in weak market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELLWAY yesterday became one of the few housebuilders to announce a rise in
profits in the latter part of 1992. The period included Britain's withdrawal
from the ERM which prompted a sharp fall in confidence of house buyers.
Despite this, Bellway managed to increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.48m
to Pounds 5.79m for the six months to January 31. House sales rose from 698
to 833.
Bellway, which has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector,
currently has Pounds 40m of cash following a Pounds 33.6m rights issue in
March.
The company intends to increase output to 4,000 homes a year by the mid
1990s, making it one of the six largest builders in the country. Since the
rights issue it has contracted to buy more than Pounds 35m worth of land.
Mr Alan Robson, finance director, said that Bellway was on target to achieve
its forecast, made at the time of the rights issue, of at least Pounds 16m
pre-tax profit for the 12 months to end-July.
First half turnover rose from Pounds 52.4m to Pounds 56.1m. Earnings per
share edged ahead from 7.3p to 7.8p. The interim dividend is maintained at
4p but directors intend to raise the final by 0.5p to 8p.
The number of homes to be built by the group during the year is expected to
rise from 1,841 to at least 2,200.
Mr Robson said that the UK housing market had turned since the beginning of
the year.
Net reservations by Bellway - agreed sales on which a deposit had been paid,
less cancellations - had increased by a third compared with the first four
months of 1992.
'Experiences are patchy and vary from development to development,' said Mr
Robson, 'but prices have begun to stabilise. We are offering less incentives
to encourage sales and prices in one or two instances have even risen
slightly.'

Capital and Regional Prop-erties, a USM-quoted property company, yesterday
announced the acquisition of an Aberdeen shopping centre for Pounds 10.1m,
along with a Pounds 13.2m placing and open offer.
The 200,000 sq ft Trinity Centre in Union Street, Aberdeen, which was
developed by Norwich Union in 1984, has 30 shops, including a 100,000 sq ft
store let to Debenhams. The annual rental income is Pounds 1.16m, which
produces an initial yield of 11.5 per cent. Mr Martin Barber, chairman, said
the deal moved the company up into the middle ranks of the property market.
However, it will not raise additional money from shareholders for another
year. Warburg Securities has placed 9.96m shares at 140p each, and
shareholders can claw back on a 1-for-2 basis.

FT  07 MAY 93 / UK Company News: RJB well placed to win contracts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RJB Mining, the private coal mining company which is preparing for
flotation, believes it is well positioned to win new open cast mining
contracts from British Coal.
The pathfinder prospectus discloses that RJB recently won a tender for the
Llanilid West contract in Wales which will involve the extraction of 770,000
tonnes of coal and generate turnover of Pounds 20m.
The company is awaiting the results of two further tenders, and is aware of
likely opportunities to tender for at least five more contracts this year.
The prospectus contains no specific profit forecasts, but says that RJB will
benefit from the deregulation of the UK coal industry in several ways.
Financial advisers are Barclays de Zoete Wedd. The flotation, which is
expected to value the company at over Pounds 100m, will be priced on May 19
and dealings will start on June 7.

FT  07 MAY 93 / UK Company News: StanChart directors forfeit bonuses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD CHARTERED, the UK-based international banking group, yesterday
disclosed that none of its directors will receive bonuses this year because
of the Pounds 305m loss in the Bombay securities trading scandal.
Mr Rodney Galpin, the retiring chairman, told the bank's annual meeting that
no performance bonuses - which comprised 20.6 per cent of executive
directors' pay last year - would be paid this year. Mr Galpin's pay rose by
29 per cent to Pounds 393,000 last year.
The bank also disclosed that it was establishing a new risk management
function as part of a wide-ranging management restructuring.
Mr Galpin said it was acting to remedy the weaknesses exposed by the
securities trading scandal.
A representative of Tan Sri Khoo Teck Puat, who holds 14.94 per cent of
Standard Chartered's equity, was among shareholders who asked critical
questions about the Bombay loss at the meeting.
Mr Galpin said that Bombay should 'never have happened' and that checking
and control of Standard Chartered's activities around the world were 'very
much at the forefront of our mind' since the fraud in India had been
exposed.

FT  07 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Inveresk expects Pounds 75m float value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVERESK, the Scotland-based speciality paper maker whose shares are to be
quoted on the Stock Exchange early next month, says it expects to grow by
developing new markets, increasing output from existing plants and acquiring
other speciality paper companies.
The company is coming to the market through a placing and intermediaries
offer. It owns three mills in eastern Scotland and one in Somerset, and was
the subject of a Pounds 31m management buy-out in 1990 from Georgia-Pacific
of the US.
The pathfinder prospectus, released yesterday by Inveresk's merchant bank
Schroders, does not give full details of the offer. But it is expected to
raise about Pounds 30m and value the company at more than Pounds 75m.
It is expected that after the flotation about 40 per cent of the company
will end up in the hands of the institutions which backed the MBO - Morgan
Grenfell, County NatWest Ventures and 3i. Between 35 and 40 per cent is
likely to be held by the management team under Mr Stefan Kay, the managing
director, with new shareholders holding the rest.
In the year to November 28 1992 Inveresk made an operating profit of Pounds
8.57m (Pounds 8.7m) on continuing activities. Turnover fell from Pounds
91.4m to Pounds 87.8m. Earnings per share were 11.5p on the existing 44.6m
shares.
The company regards its performance as creditable in the face of recession
in the UK and its markets in continental Europe.
It says that results for the first four months of the current financial year
were ahead of those for the same period last year. There is no profits
forecast.
The full prospectus will be published on May 20. Trading begins on June 2.
James Capel is broker to the issue.

FT  07 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Co-operative Retail expands despite slight
fall in sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CO-OPERATIVE Retail Services, one of the UK's biggest retailers, yesterday
reported a substantial increase in profits for the year ended January 30,
despite the high street recession and a marginal decline in sales.
CRS reported a surplus before distribution of Pounds 41.6m, compared with a
previous Pounds 33.2m.
The pre-tax surplus amounted to Pounds 25.9m, against Pounds 21.6m, and was
struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 5.15m (Pounds 638,000).
Turnover slipped to Pounds 1.45bn against Pounds 1.5bn. Net sales, which
take account of VAT, were 3.6 per cent lower at Pounds 1.34bn (Pounds
1.39bn) mainly reflecting the sale of the dairy business in July last year
to MD Foods.
Despite the lack of sales growth, and the loss of the dairy business
contribution, trading profits increased to Pounds 52.5m (Pounds 50m)
reflecting margin improvements and tight control over expense levels.
Trading margins improved from 3.6 per cent to 3.9 per cent.
The food division, which includes the Leo's, Stop &amp; Shop and Pioneer chains,
increased sales by 1.6 per cent to Pounds 1.13bn with profits up 17.7 per
cent. The non-food division, including the Living department stores and Home
World furnishing stores, increased turnover by 0.9 per cent to Pounds 234m
despite 'the harsh economic background.'
Net interest costs fell to Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 16.8m). Gearing tumbled to
27 per cent (58 per cent) mainly reflecting the sale of the dairy division
and the net positive cash flow of Pounds 83.6m.
Operating surplus - after interest and distributions - increased to Pounds
31.1m (Pounds 22.3m) which Mr Harry Moore, chief executive, said underlined
the society's commitment to building a successful platform for future
development.

FT  07 MAY 93 / UK Company News: BP's shares rise as first quarter pleases
City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum surprised the City in reporting better-than-expected first
quarter profits of Pounds 231m - before exceptional items - on a replacement
cost basis, compared with Pounds 73m.
The shares rose 10p to 306p.
Mr David Simon, chief executive, said the improvement in profits for the
three months to March 31 had largely been a result of 'self help'. He said
trading conditions had been tough and although BP had maintained sales,
margins were lower.
BP's cost-cutting exercise generated surplus cashflow of Pounds 600m in the
first quarter, allowing the company to pay down debt and reduce its
debt-to-equity ratio from 99 per cent at the end of last year to 94 per
cent.
Mr Simon said the company had paid off Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.16bn) of debt
since the middle of last year, leaving a burden of Dollars 14.5bn.
He warned, however, that cashflow in the second quarter would be adversely
affected by Dollars 630m tax due to the Alaskan government and lower
divestment proceeds, although refining margins had recently improved.
A decline in the oil price and a drop in refining margins had led to a
downturn of Dollars 150m in income, Mr Simon pointed out. However, that had
been more than offset by lower costs and an improvement in the
dollar-sterling rate.
While BP's sales of refined products were up by 6 per cent in the first
quarter and gas sales rose by 2 per cent, refining margins fell 50 cents in
Europe and 30 cents in the US.
'These results are quite good, because BP is moving to a perfectly
respectable level of earnings when the environment is not improving at all,
in fact it is deteriorating,' said Mr Nick Antill, analyst at Hoare Govett,
the stockbroker.
The company's overall replacement cost profit - which strips out gains and
losses from oil stocks - was up from Pounds 200m in the final quarter last
year. The contribution to operating profit from exploration and production
held steady from the fourth quarter at Pounds 516m, against Pounds 515m, in
spite of a Dollars 1.50 a barrel drop in the oil price. A year ago the
contribution was Pounds 414m.
Refining and marketing achieved profits of Pounds 124m (Pounds 36m), up from
Pounds 117m in the fourth quarter. Chemicals showed a loss of Pounds 14m
against loses of Pounds 6m a year earlier and Pounds 22m in the fourth
quarter. Earnings in the first quarter increased from 1.4p to 4.3p while the
dividend is cut to 2.1p (4.2p).

FT  07 MAY 93 / UK Company News: A late victim of the recession - Heavy debt
provisions have hit profits at Bank of Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAS THE angel of the British clearing banks fallen from grace? It was
tempting to draw such a conclusion yesterday as Bank of Scotland announced
an 11 per cent fall in pre-tax profits only a day after its old rival, Royal
Bank of Scotland, started to show clear evidence of recovering from the
worst.
Bank of Scotland has achieved an enviable reputation in the past few years
of being both less accident-prone than others, and of running operations
efficiently. It avoided the exposure to lending in the south of England that
has hurt most banks, and its ratio of costs to income has been far lower.
Yet as signs appear of economic growth, Bank of Scotland's 45 per cent rise
in debt provisions raised questions about whether it under-provided earlier
in the cycle. It also had to respond to doubts about whether it will
generate enough income to increase assets without the need for a rights
issue.
Provisions rose in the second half of the year to February 28 - the bank
provided Pounds 233.7m of a total Pounds 371.7m in the second half. This
included six provisions worth at least Pounds 5m, and an adjustment to a
provisioning formula at Forthright Finance, its motor finance subsidiary.
The bank argued yesterday that several factors lay behind the deterioration
in the second half, including the fact that recession reached Scotland
during the year; that it suffered two months more recession because its year
ends in February; and that it was hit by one-off failures.
'We have had to revisit the same accounts several times as the recession has
spiralled down. That makes us uncomfortable, but it does not mean our
judgment was wrong,' said Mr Bruce Patullo, governor and chief executive.
But the bank none the less accepts that it has lessons to learn.
One of these relates to the way in which it has expanded its loan book in
England without the branch network of rival banks. It has instead relied on
direct services run by telephone and computer, and corporate lending carried
out at 20 regional offices around England.
Although the bank believes that direct banking subsidiaries, such as its NWS
Bank finance house based in Chester, can carry out accurate risk assessment
using credit scoring, it accepts there is some potential weakness in its
lack of local branch managers who can assess businesses face-to-face.
It is attempting to strengthen local knowledge by ensuring that its regional
managers become closer to local business establishments. 'We have got to
become good friends with the key local lawyers and accountants who know
businesses,' said Mr Peter Burt, treasurer and chief general manager.
The rise in provisions, combined with a 16 per cent rise in assets, weakened
the ratio of Tier 1 capital - its equity plus retained earnings - to
risk-weighted assets to 5.8 per cent from 6.5 per cent in 1992. This remains
above banks such as National Westminster, but is below most large US banks.
This reinforces a criticism of the bank by some analysts: that it is not
generating a high enough return on its capital to prevent it from making
regular rights issues. The last issue - of Pounds 194m - was two years ago,
and it would face scepticism if it tried to raise more capital soon.
Mr Patullo insists this is not necessary. He says the bank has made careful
projections, and believes it will be able to maintain its Tier 1 ratio at
5.8 per cent over the coming year without a large improvement in debt
provisions, provided that loan growth does not exceed 5 per cent.
Yet this, in turn, raises a question about whether it will have to limit
loan growth just as the recovery starts. Mr Julian Robins, analyst at BZW,
argues that a curtailment of loans would curb Bank of Scotland's earnings
because it is heavily reliant on traditional loan-related business.
Mr Robins says the bank is relying both on its poor second half for
provisions being an aberration, and the assumption that loan demand will
tail off from last year.
'They are making some rather dangerous assumptions, and I am not necessarily
convinced,' says Mr Robins.
Mr Patullo argues that the bank's strong growth in income - net interest
income rose by 16 per cent - combined with cost control will see it through.
But he believes it will have to achieve pre-tax return on equity of more
than 20 per cent in the long term to generate enough capital internally.

<TEXT>
THE Stock Exchange hasissued details of proposed dealings on a 'when-issued'
basis in the shares which will result from Imperial Chemical Industries'
proposed demerger and the rights issue from Zeneca, its bioscience part.
Last week Salomon Brothers International stopped making an unofficial 'grey
market' in the new securities at the Stock Exchange's request. The Exchange
said then that it would sanction dealings once the terms of Zeneca's rights
issue had been set.
Dealings will start at 2.30pm on May 12, the day ICI is to announce the
terms. They will be in the new ICI shares, the Zeneca shares ex-demerger and
the nil-paid Zeneca rights.
All dealings will be conditional on the demerger going ahead. If it does not
the trades will be declared null and void.
Prices will be quoted on the Seaq system.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Argentaria offer given enthusiastic reception

<TEXT>
ARGENTARIA, Spain's state-owned banking group, yesterday said the public
issue of 25 per cent of its shares to raise Pta120bn (Pounds 687m) had
closed heavily oversubscribed.
International investors subscribed for 10.6 times the shares on offer.
The oversubscription comes as the peseta is under pressure and when
potential political instability is forecast in Spain ahead of the June 6
general election.
Argentaria is placing only 39 per cent (Pta41.8bn) of the total 25 per cent
equity offering outside Spain but international demand for the banking
group's paper totalled Pta445bn - slightly less than the Pta476bn at which
the offer values the whole group.
In Spain, where 61 per cent of the offering will be placed, domestic
institutions and retail investors oversubscribed by 4.6 times. Demand in the
retail tranche totalled Pta206bn against the Pta55.1bn offered.
More than 370,000 small domestic investors applied for paper, which gives
Argentaria the biggest share register of any Spanish banking institution.
Argentaria shares will start trading in Madrid, New York and London on May
12. Analysts believe that a big proportion of the domestically held equity
could eventually end up abroad.
The issue has been globally co-ordinated by Morgan Stanley.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Greencore shares suspended after possible rule breach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Greencore, the Irish sugar, malting and milling group, were
suspended yesterday after it was disclosed that the placing of the Irish
government's stake could have breached the company's articles of
association.
Davy Stockbrokers, adviser to the Irish government in the sale, said 4.45m
of the 25m shares had been placed with institutions in which it had an
interest and 2.5m had been placed with SG Warburg, which had agreed to
partly underwrite the issue.
Since Davys is part of the Bank of Ireland Group, which owns 15 per cent of
Greencore through the Investment Bank of Ireland, the placing would breach
the company's rules restricting holdings to a maximum of 15 per cent. The
Irish Stock Exchange reacted by announcing an investigation. It comes less
than a week after the Irish government said it had successfully disposed of
its remaining 30.4 per cent stake in Greencore.
Davys initially agreed that SG Warburg would underwrite the issue, subject
to a maximum uptake of 10m shares, for which it would receive a commission
of Pounds 250,000.
When Davys only placed 17.5m of the shares, they entered into the
arrangement with Warburg to take up the extra shares. They then revised that
arrangement to include other purchasers. Warburg took 2.54m shares, its fee
was cut to Pounds 100,000 and Davys agreed to shoulder any losses.
Mr Bertie Ahern, finance minister, who yesterday gave an account of the
transaction to the Irish parliament, said: 'I am seriously concerned and
disappointed that important steps were taken by Davys without either my
knowledge or agreement.'
Greencore, formed from the privatised Irish sugar company, said Davys could
still proceed with the placing if it was given permission to own more than
15 per cent. Mr Gerry Murphy, Greencore's chief executive, said: 'The
placing does not need to be unwound.'
After taking legal advice Mr Murphy said contracts with institutions
agreeing to buy shares in the placing were 'legally enforceable'. However,
last night Davys was unsure whether the contracts could be enforced even if
the company's 15 per cent maximum holding rule was circumvented.
The company is privately furious that disposal of the Irish government's
stake has incurred problems for a second time.
The proposed deal was worth Pounds 68m, valuing the shares at 275p each.
They were yesterday suspended at 272p.
Robert Fleming, the company's adviser, had hoped to work on the sale, but
the government decided Davys could handle it alone.
ADM, the US food company, recently withdrew from talks to buy the stake.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Foreign buyers fancy a spring fling in gilts: Sara Webb asks
how long overseas demand for UK government bonds will last
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN investors have returned to the UK government bond market this spring
after a noticeable absence. Overseas purchases of gilts amounted to Pounds
1.134bn in March, up from Pounds 1.031bn in February and triple the month's
sales to UK buyers.
With a forecast Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) of Pounds 50bn
for 1993-94, the Bank needs to attract as many buyers to the gilt market as
possible - both domestic and overseas.
The renewed foreign interest this spring has been sparked by three things:
the potential to make currency gains as sterling strengthened against other
currencies; the potential to make capital gains as gilt prices rallied on
hopes of falling interest rates; and the availability of relatively high
yields compared with those on other government bonds.
While sterling was a member of the European exchange rate mechanism, foreign
investors played an important role in helping to fund the PSBR. They held
between 13 per cent and 17 per cent of total UK government debt. With
sterling in the ERM, they felt the exchange-rate risk was much lower, and
they expected a gradual cut in UK interest rates as inflation fell,
resulting in a rally in gilt prices.
However, foreigners got cold feet as sterling came under intense speculative
pressure in August and early September. The outflow sparked worries that the
government would face difficulties in funding the growing PBSR in 1992-93
and 1993-94.
The Bank's latest figures suggest the tide may have turned. Some dealers
claim they have noticed healthy foreign demand for gilts since February,
prompted by hopes that sterling would appreciate against other currencies,
especially the D-Mark. Sterling fell to DM2.3275 in February, but has risen,
closing yesterday at DM2.48.
Mr Kim Thomsen, head of fixed income at fund management group Danske Invest,
expects sterling to appreciate to DM2.50-DM2.60. 'We look at both the
currency and the return on the bond side when we are investing in the bond
markets. I think when Germany cuts rates, sterling will strengthen so the
currency would get an extra kick.'
Mr Michael Korn, head of bond portfolio management at Deutsche Investment
Trust, Dresdner Bank's investment arm, says 'Sterling is still interesting
for German investors because of the potential for currency appreciation. We
see sterling in the DM2.45-DM2.55 range.'
Japanese investors also have been buying UK securities - both equities and
gilts. Mr Chris Dillow, economist at Nomura International, says: 'The
strength of the yen against all currencies, particularly sterling, has acted
as a force for outward investment from Japan.'
Mr Malcolm Roberts, head of global bond research at UBS, says that even
though gilt yields have declined, they are still relatively high compared
with those in other bond markets. For Japanese investors, 10-year gilt
yields of 8 per cent compare very favourably with domestic debt yields of
4.33 per cent.
'I could see one more cut in the UK if the economy remains weak or if
Germany starts to cut rates very fast' says Mr Kim Thomsen of Danske Invest.
'The Bundesbank could cut rates very rapidly once they realise how deep the
recession is in Germany.'
However, there are plenty of foreign investors who believe that the gilt
market is now less attractive than other government bond markets, especially
since recent economic data suggest the UK may be pulling out of recession,
reducing the chance of further interest-rate cuts.
'The potential for low rates is not too exciting' claims Mr Korn of DIT. 'In
a European context the UK is well ahead in the cycle, so the potential for
lower rates is less than in Italy and Spain.'
Mr Martin Wooller, head of fixed income at the UK operations of Fidelity,
the US fund managers, thinks there are other, better opportunities, 'because
of the high real interest rates available elsewhere'.
'Once the ERM tensions have gone, Italy and Spain may be able to lower
rates, so the high-yielding markets become more attractive,' says Mr Andreas
Johannsen, portfolio manager at DWS, the investment management arm of
Deutsche Bank and Germany's largest fund management group.
Longer-term, investors worry that inflation in the UK could start to pick up
again. 'The effects of devaluation will come through at some stage,' says Mr
Johannsen. 'Inflation is not a problem now but it will be a problem later
this year.'
An additional worry is the prospect of heavy supply of gilts in the next
year.
The Bank of England has said it will hold an auction roughly every month,
offering between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 4bn of stock at each sale.
'The amount of issuance that must be placed is quite daunting, especially if
there are no further interest rate cuts' says Mr Johannsen.
Given the freedom on movement of capital, foreign investors can pick and
choose their financial markets with ease. While the gilt market has held the
foreigners' gaze in recent weeks, longer-term it may prove difficult to keep
them constant.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Bank of Scotland increases provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANK OF SCOTLAND yesterday disclosed an 11 per cent fall in pre-tax profits
after a series of mishaps in the second half of the year contributed to a 45
per cent rise in provisions for bad and doubtful debts.
In spite of a 24 per cent rise in operating profits to Pounds 487.9m for the
year to February 28, pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 125.3m, against Pounds
140.7m in 1992. The bank had experienced 'another very difficult year'.
Among problems that led to a provision of Pounds 371.7m, against Pounds
256.8m, were six individual provisions of more than Pounds 5m and losses at
its motor finance arm Forthright Finance, which led to the bank injecting
capital to strengthen a subsidiary.
The bank emphasised it had achieved record operating profits, and reduced
its already low ratio of costs-to-income to 51.5 per cent, against 54 per
cent. It expected to reduce the ratio below 50 per cent.
Bad debts provisions were higher in the second half at Pounds 233.7m
compared with Pounds 138m in the first. The bank said the increase reflected
'the downturn moving north into Scotland, and a further fall in asset values
in the south'.
The bank's measure of core capital strength - the ratio of tier 1 capital to
risk-weighted assets - fell to 5.8 per cent from 6.5 per cent. It said it
expected to at least maintain that level of tier 1 capital over the coming
year.
Countrywide Banking Corporation, the New Zealand operation of which Bank of
Scotland became sole owner last year recorded a Pounds 1.4m loss after high
bad debt provisions.
The worst problem was at Bank of Wales, which incurred a Pounds 15.3m loss
after it found the 19-year-old provisioning formula at Forthright Finance
was inadequate. The bank injected Pounds 16m of equity and Pounds 8m of loan
stock into the subsidiary.
There was a 23 per cent increase in operating profits before provisions in
clearing bank operations to Pounds 331.1m, against Pounds 269.2m. However,
profit after provisions fell by 23 per cent to Pounds 75.2m, against Pounds
97.2m.
The bank recommended a final dividend of 2.8p per ordinary share, making a
total of 4.57p for the year, an increase of 5.1 per cent on the 4.35p for
1992.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Gartmore seeks insider dealing review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PAUL Myners, chairman of UK fund manager Gartmore, yesterday claimed
insider dealing is common in the City and called for a 'radical review' of
the way the stock exchange and other authorities investigate the abuse.
He said stock exchange investigations into allegations of insider dealing
were poorly organised and may lack the right resources.
'The investigators don't go into enough depth and are very easily satisfied
by superficial answers. I'm concerned that theft is taking place, and it's
doing a great deal of damage to confidence in our financial institutions,'
he said.
Mr Myners raised his concerns in a letter in today's Financial Times, in
which he claims the system for catching insider dealers is not working.
He was responding to a sharp fall last week in the share price of Tiphook,
the transport rental group in which Gartmore held 3 per cent, but has now
largely sold out. Tiphook's shares fell from 329p to 293p, or 11 per cent,
before the company issued a profits warning last Thursday. The stock
exchange is understood to be investigating dealings in the company's shares.
Mr Robert Montague, Tiphook chairman, said that before the profits warning
only the company's key directors and corporate finance directors at its
financial adviser UBS knew about the planned announcement. He said the
company did not believe insider dealing had taken place. Tiphook believed
the share price fell because of other factors, such as rumours about a loss
on an investment in an associate.
But some of Tiphook's other institutional shareholders have complained that
information has leaked from the company in the past. 'This is not the first
time it has happened with Tiphook,' according to Mr Douglas Ferrans,
director of UK equities at Scottish Amicable.
The stock exchange rejected Mr Myners' criticisms and said standards for
investigation and detection of market abuse are very high. 'There is no
doubt detection is extremely good. The problem is the UK's enforcement
procedures. The legislation is not conducive to prosecutions,' according to
Mr Mike Feltham, head of surveillance.
He said the exchange detected 'quite a substantial amount' of insider
dealing, and suggested a central enforcement agency.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Argentaria issue oversubscribed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTARIA, Spain's state-owned banking group, yesterday said the public
issue of 25 per cent of its shares to raise Pta120bn (Pounds 687bn) had
closed heavily oversubscribed.
Foreign interest was particularly high with international investors
subscribing for 10.6 times the shares on offer.
The oversubscription comes as the peseta is under pressure and when
potential political instability is forecast in Spain ahead of the June 6
general election.
Argentaria is placing only 39 per cent (Pta41.8bn) of the total 25 per cent
equity offering outside Spain but international demand for the banking
group's paper totalled Pta445bn - slightly less than the Pta476bn at which
the offer values the whole group.
In Spain, where 61 per cent of the offering will be placed, domestic
institutions and retail investors oversubscribed by 4.6 times. Demand in the
retail tranche totalled Pta206bn against the Pta55.1bn offered.
More than 370,000 small domestic investors applied for paper, a total that
automatically gave Argentaria the biggest share register of any Spanish
banking institution.
Argentaria shares will start trading in Madrid, New York and London on May
12. Analysts believe a big proportion of the domestically held equity could
end up abroad.
The issue has been globally co-ordinated by Morgan Stanley of the US and
Argentaria is able to distribute the international tranche on the basis of
quality of demand for its shares.
Success of the offering has been largely due to investor approval of the
Argentaria management team headed by chairman, Mr Francisco Luzon. 'There is
a general feeling that this a clean, tough team creating an efficiency
story,' said an executive of one of lead banks.

FT  07 MAY 93 / LWT managers likely to receive Pounds 55m payout:
Broadcasting union attacks 'obscene' share scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGERS AT London Weekend Television seem likely to hit the biggest jackpot
yet in British television history with a payout worth more than Pounds 55m
that will create 15 millionaires.
Under a management option scheme linked to share performance, Sir
Christopher Bland, chairman of the ITV station, stands to make a gross
profit of more than Pounds 7m in September, the trigger month for the
scheme.
Mr Greg Dyke, LWT chief executive, Mr Ron Miller, sales director and Mr
Brian Tesler, former chairman, are each likely to get more than Pounds 5.3m.
Ironically if Mr John Birt, BBC director-general, had stayed at LWT, he
would have had more than Pounds 5m in shares instead of a BBC pay package of
just Pounds 200,000 a year.
Sir Christopher denied yesterday that the scheme was too generous to
management.
'It's an outstanding reward for outstanding performance,' he said.
Since the scheme was launched, LWT has been the top ITV performer on the
Stock Exchange and 10th in the All-Share Index.
The millionaires-to-be at LWT extend beyond the top echelons of management.
Mr Melvyn Bragg, the author and head of arts at LWT, and Mr Nick Elliott,
director of programmes, are likely to get more than Pounds 2.2m.
Others to benefit will include Mr Derek Hemment, sales manager; Mr Robin
Paxton, controller of current affairs; Mr Mike Southgate, managing director
of the London Studios, and Mr Barry Cox, director of corporate affairs.
The payouts have only become possible because LWT retained its ITV franchise
in the 1991 competitive tenders with a low bid of Pounds 7.58m a year and
has cut costs since.
The aim was to tie managers to the company during the franchise period.
Other LWT staff did not get special payments for retaining the franchise,
although there is a company profit-sharing scheme.
Special payments at Scottish Television, which retained its franchise with a
bid of only Pounds 2,000 a year, totalled less than Pounds 2m. Some winning
ITV companies made no special pay-ments.
The LWT scheme, which prompted controversy among a number of institutional
shareholders at the time, dates from a 1989 capital restructuring when the
company gave existing shareholders 130p a share paid out of company
resources and debt to reduce the equity base by two thirds.
At the same time, 44 managers were able to subscribe for unlisted management
shares at 83.2p - to be paid for in cash or by rolling up the proceeds of an
existing share scheme.
A number of thresholds were set for converting the management shares into
multiples of ordinary shares.
To trigger the maximum payout of 4.048 ordinary shares for every management
share, the LWT share price has to hit an average 278p in the 20 business
days after this September's announcement of half-year results to June 1993.
Yesterday the LWT share price reached 392p as confidence continued to grow
in the prospects for a recovery in television advertising.
Last month Bectu, the broadcasting union, compiled the gross profit for the
44 LWT managers when the share price stood at 385p - a figure that would
give Sir Christopher a gross profit of Pounds 7,091,342. The lowest figure
is Pounds 73,750.
Yesterday Bectu described the management share scheme as 'obscene'.

So now we know what LWT really stands for: Lottery Winners' Ticket. The huge
share option bonuses LWT's top 44 managers can soon cash in represent a new
benchmark of some kind. No-one can dispute the contribution LWT's management
has made in hanging tough and bidding low in the farce that was the
television franchise auction. But other successful directors like those of
Scottish and Central have not been recompensed on anything like the same
scale. LWT's managers' rewards are out of all proportion to the risks they
ran or the effort they expended.

FT  07 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Jefferson Smurfit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jefferson Smurfit is a curious stock market beast. There are few enough
quoted cardboard box manufacturers exposed to markets as diverse as
Venezuela and Ireland, fewer still that make any money from them.
Shareholders may be disgruntled that pre-tax profits fell 39 per cent to
IPounds 95.5m last year. That, though, represents a creditable achievement
given Smurfit's chronically depressed markets.
The company's robust balance sheet and geographical spread have enabled it
to weather the recession better than most. Although some may baulk at
Smurfit deriving almost 60 per cent of its trading profits from Latin
America, others will view that as an attraction, given the continuing
weakness of continental European markets. There are benefits to come from
the flotation of Smurfit's US associate, JSC. That, though, may be later
rather than sooner given its trading weakness and the pricing troubles in
the US board market.
Whatever Smurfit's attractions, though, investors may find their gaze
straying elsewhere if recovery really does take hold. Smurfit's more highly
geared Scandinavian and north American rivals should see their profits shoot
ahead far faster.

FT  07 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The good news that overseas buyers bought a little over Pounds 1.1bn of
gilts in March has its counterpart in data on purchases by other investors.
Banks and building societies bought Pounds 1.3bn, other UK investors only
Pounds 370m. The figures may have been distorted by the March auction which
was only settled in April. However it looks as though institutional interest
reported during March was more related to switching out along the yield
curve than outright buying. Institutions' reluctance to commit much new
money to gilts is disconcerting given the fickleness of both overseas and
bank buyers.
In public most banks have professed a distinct lack of enthusiasm for gilts.
Those that have built up their holdings have less incentive now that hopes
of lower base rates have faded.
Understandably liquidity worries are growing in the gilt market, which is
expecting a new auction announcement soon as well as large calls in existing
issues. Overseas buyers are less likely to come to the rescue now that
sterling's failure to rise above DM 2.50 has cast doubts about its room for
further appreciation. Insofar as this reflects Bank of England intervention,
the authorities are making life more difficult for themselves. Already in
March, PSBR funding was offset by about Pounds 1.6bn in intervention,
presumably to replace the money spent defending the ERM parity. The longer
that continues, the more gilts the Bank will have to sell.

Bank of Scotland has a number of excuses for the jump in its second half
provisions. Those at its Bank of Wales and Countrywide subsidiaries were a
one-off adjustment. With luck the larger hits, like that for Isosceles, will
not be repeated, so provisions should fall this year. But there remains the
nagging doubt that the latest figures also reflect the quality of the bank's
loan book. If so, the decline could be marginal, especially given Bank of
Scotland's relatively low provisions earlier in the recession.
This matters because the bank needs retained earnings to underwrite growth
at the operating level. Second half operating profit rose 46 per cent on the
same period of 1991-92. That was thanks partly to a reduction in the
underlying growth rate of costs but it also reflects higher lending,
particularly on mortgages. At 5.8 per cent the tier 1 capital has reached
the point where assets cannot grow unchecked. The shares have
under-performed the sector by 10 per cent since last September. Until the
trend on provisions is clearer, it is too early to bet on Bank of Scotland
recovering its premium rating.

FT  07 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: BP's transatlantic affair
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
American investors who believed the BP story had their faith sorely tested
last year. Yet despite the dividend cut, the departure of its aggressive
US-style chairman and a limp share price performance, US holdings of BP's
stock grew from 8 per cent to 23 per cent in 1992. In large part this
reflected BP's relative attraction, using US cash flow valuations. Even now
BP sells on around 4.5 times its cash flow, while comparable US companies
such as Chevron and Arco sell for a multiple of about 6 and Exxon and Shell
around 7. Sophisticated investors who adjust for the cost of servicing debt
will doubtless argue that this overstates the attraction. Even they concede
that BP is still at a 10 per cent discount to its competition.
That should be some comfort to those who fear that US profit taking could do
for the BP share price what it did for Glaxo. Further underpinning came from
yesterday's results, which showed that the company's cost cutting programme
was starting to produce results without much help from dismal refining and
chemicals markets. By setting his face against a rights issue Mr David
Simon, the chief executive, seems determined to keep the company's feet to
the fire. Stability has returned and further cost savings may come in areas
such as refining and marketing, but BP's solid core of debt remains. It
seems clear that some form of additional risk capital will be needed once
the company is ready to go back on to the offensive. A rights issue still
seems most likely, and by 1995-96 the scars from the dividend cut may have
healed. Meanwhile those UK investors who believe the recovery story will
have to cast aside their traditional yield prop if they want to go along for
the walk.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Virgin targets personal computers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Richard Branson's Virgin Group is planning an assault on Britain's Pounds
3bn-a-year personal computer business.
The airline-to-music group wants to take a substantial share of the market,
bringing it into competition with traditional suppliers such as
International Business Machines and Compaq as well as more recent entrants
such as Amstrad and Elonex.
The vehicle for Virgin's move is Virgin Euromagnetics, a small electronics
company turning over about Pounds 12m annually which Virgin has owned for
two years. It supplies computer media such as floppy diskette packs which
Virgin sells in its stores.
The company has designed and built an advanced machine based on the most
popular microprocessor chip, the Intel 80/486.
Mr John Jenkins, Virgin Euromagnetics sales and marketing manager, said a UK
factory, as yet unnamed, would build PCs only for Virgin. Production rates
are expected to start at around 3,000 a month.
The machine is expected to cost about Pounds 1,100, and Virgin is discussing
selling a package of computer plus a laser printer for about Pounds 1,250.
The plan is to start acceptance testing both inside Virgin and with selected
customers in the next few weeks in preparation for a grand launch at the
Business Computing Show in September.
The PC business in the UK is one of the most difficult in Europe,
characterised by savage price cutting and fierce competition.
Mr Jeremy Davies of Context, a London-based consultancy which analyses the
UK PC market said: 'If the Virgin products are attractively packaged and
competitively priced, then there is no reason why they should not do well.'

FT  07 MAY 93 / Watchdog may seek curbs on unsuitable life sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFE insurance sales agents may be required to tell prospective customers
what they are allowed to sell, who pays them and the charges for each
product in graph form if proposals being considered by the Securities and
Investments Board go ahead.
SIB, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, yesterday released a study by
consultant Mr Tim Miller of possible new rules which would limit sales of
unsuitable products. An SIB study last year found that one quarter to one
third of all life insurance products were cancelled within the first two
years, leaving policy holders with little or no refund of premiums paid.
It is believed that high lapse rates of policies in early years are closely
linked to their sale to people for whom they are clearly unsuitable.
The centrepiece of the proposals is a chart which outlines at a glance what
the value of a policy is each year until it matures. Consumers would be
given a prospectus on the product and a chart setting out in numerical terms
the information in the graph. Customers would be able to see the effect of
cancelling a policy in each year until it matures.
Mr Miller's proposals address most of the objections to current rules raised
by an Office of Fair Trading report in March which said that the rules on
disclosure limited competition in the sale of life insurance and served
consumers badly.
Like the OFT, Mr Miller proposes that life companies should be required to
tell prospective customers their own charges for each product sold instead
of showing the average charge throughout the industry, as now.
Mr Miller's report stops short of proposing an OFT suggestion that
independent financial advisers should tell prospective customers how much
commission they will earn on each sale. He believes that requiring it would
clutter up the graphs.
SIB said yesterday it was considering Mr Miller's report along with that of
the OFT.
Prudential yesterday said it 'shared the objectives of clear disclosure in
ways which people will understand and that is something which needs to be
properly thought through and properly tested before being brought in'.

FT  07 MAY 93 / French audit shows rising deficit in public finances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SPECIAL audit ordered by France's new Conservative government yesterday
confirmed the gaping hole in the country's public finances ahead of the
budget next week which is expected to raise taxes and cut spending.
The audit, conducted by Mr Jean Raynaud, a senior official of the state
accounting body, shows overall accumulated deficits in the budget and the
social security system rising to an estimated FFr475bn (Pounds 57.09bn) by
the end of this year. Most of the social security system is funded outside
the budget by contributions from employers and employees.
The audit assumes that the economy could contract by up to 1 per cent this
year. Basing itself on a median forecast of a 0.4 per cent drop in gross
domestic product, it says the recession's effect in depressing tax receipts
and raising social spending could increase the budget deficit from FFr226bn
last year to FFr341bn this year.
Such a deficit would amount to 4.8 per cent of France's national output,
well above the 3 per cent guideline in the Maastricht treaty on monetary
union. This in turn explains prime minister Edouard Balladur's recent
comment that any talk of accelerating the Maastricht currency union
timetable was a 'pious wish', given the state of public finance in France
and many other EC countries. He said his aim was to cut France's deficit to
less than 3 per cent by 1996-97.
Mr Raynaud, a long-time friend of the new prime minister, denied his report
sought to pin blame on the previous Socialist government. Nevertheless, one
Socialist MP accused the government of 'polemicising' the country's
financial problems.
This year's still-larger budget deficit will be the result of reduced tax
revenue (FFr120bn lower than first forecast) and higher spending (an extra
FFr55bn, much of it on temporary work schemes), the report calculates.
The Raynaud audit says the deficit in France's social security system was
'unprecedented'. The accumulated deficit of the pension, health and family
allowances funds will rise to nearly FFr100bn by the end of 1993.
In addition, the unemployment insurance scheme could go bankrupt next month
unless the state tops up it up.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BY OVERWHELMINGLY rejecting the Vance-Owen peace plan, the Bosnian Serb
parliament has taken a fateful decision which will either be swiftly
reversed or hasten international military intervention in
Bosnia-Hercegovina. Either way, a new chapter has been opened in the crisis
over the former Yugoslavia which will be more testing for western powers
than the previous one of faltering mediation and a hamstrung humanitarian
relief effort.
Lord Owen, the European Community mediator, spoke clearly and correctly
yesterday about the immediate risks. One is that western governments, under
mounting domestic pressure to stop the fighting, will lurch rapidly into a
half-baked military strategy consisting solely of air strikes against the
Serbs' supply lines, in the process endangering the lives of the thousands
of troops already deployed under United Nations colours in the shattered
republic. Worse, the alliance that has thus far held on the Bosnian issue
between the US, Britain, France and Russia could come under increasing
strain if Washington is tempted to go it alone, either in military action or
in other measures to redress the balance of power on the ground between the
Serb aggressors and the mainly Moslem aggressees.
It is thus of some comfort that all external parties have been careful to
emphasise the importance of maintaining a united front as they grope for
ways of further stepping-up the pressure on the Serbs. It is also possible,
just possible, that yesterday's parliament decision in Pale may have opened
up a rift within the Serbian camp that will help channel concerted western
pressure to a productive end.
In rejecting Vance-Owen, the Bosnian Serbs have delivered a rebuff not just
to the international community but to their long-time mentor, arms supplier
and source of succour, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia. His calls for
acceptance of a settlement have come perilously late in the day. To judge by
his past record, they may be a wholly insincere attempt to fend off economic
sanctions and military threats.
But the important fact is that, under duress, he made them. In doing so, he
may have calculated - as he did last year in helping to halt the carnage in
eastern Croatia - that his political survival will be best served by trying
to pull his allies back from confrontation. It is now for the west and for
Russia to take him at his word and force him to bring the Bosnian Serbs to
heel.
More than rhetoric will be required. Mr Milosevic will have to impose on the
Bosnian Serbs what the west is trying to impose on him: an economic and
military blockade, and complete political isolation. Nor should the UN be
satisfied with a promise to do so. It should insist on placing monitors on
the borders of Serbia and Montenegro with Bosnia to ensure that arms or
other supplies do not continue to flow.
All the while, it should maintain the full array of sanctions on Belgrade,
and continue to prepare credible and politically coherent military options:
a substantial international peacekeeping force if the Bosnian Serbs agree to
Vance-Owen; if not, intervention on the ground to halt their advance and
protect such Moslem communities as remain. It is now up to Mr Milosevic
which course prevails.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission is at last taking the challenge of central and
eastern Europe seriously. To their credit, Sir Leon Brittan, commissioner
for external economic relations, and Mr Hans van den Broek, commissioner for
external political relations, have proposed accelerated trade liberalisation
and a 'clear commitment to eventual membership'. To its credit, the
Commission as a whole has agreed. The heads of government meeting in
Copenhagen next month need to show that they deserve some credit too.
The grudging approach taken by the EC to trade with Bulgaria, the Czech
Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia has been little short of
scandalous. Concern about the fate of a few EC industries has been allowed
to outweigh a strategic EC interest.
The role of liberal trade agreements with central and eastern Europe is more
than to offer increased opportunities for exports. Such agreements are also
a way to strengthen market oriented reform. When the EC itself sets a
protectionist example, however, the legitimacy of reform is undermined in
countries suffering from a far more painful adjustment than anything in
prospect for the EC.
According to an article by Jim Rollo and Alastair Smith in the latest issue
of Economic Policy, between 33 per cent (for Romania) and 58 per cent (for
Hungary) of the pre-transition EC imports from central and eastern Europe
were in categories it deems sensitive. Even under the 'Europe agreements'
signed in 1992, these sensitive categories - processed foods, textiles,
clothing, footwear, steel and chemicals - remain subject to tight
protectionist measures.
A vision has been needed. The Commission's proposals, while imperfect,
provide this. The heads of EC governments need to show they can see it too.
They need to show the EC can still respond to challenges. Nothing on the
Copenhagen agenda is likely to be as amenable to effective action as these
proposals. Nothing is likely to be more important either.

Becoming America's first black agriculture secretary is some achievement,
but the only response Mike Espy's success has won from his parents is: 'We
told you so.'
It seems that, unlike the other children of the Mississippi Delta family,
young Mike never had any idea what he wanted to do when he grew up. His
parents therefore set him a test. In his absence, they laid on the table a
Dollars 20 bill, a bible and a bottle of whisky, then waited to see which
he'd pick up first on his return.
Their idea was that if he chose the money, he'd be a banker; if the bible, a
preacher; and if the whisky, ah well . . . Instead, however, he scooped up
all three, tucking the bible under one arm, the bottle under the other, and
sticking the bill in his pocket.
'Oh no] He's going to be a politician,' gasped his prescient parent.

Adding insult to injury, shareholders in Philips who haven't seen a dividend
in three years, yesterday witnessed their AGM going-home present -
traditionally a compact disc produced by Polygram - also evaporate into thin
air.
Nothing to do with the current hoo-ha about the exorbitant cost of CDs in
Europe - 'we're not a spiteful company,' a London-based spokesman was quick
to point out - the measure was attributed by president Jan Timmer simply to
energetic corporate belt-tightening.
Shareholders had been warned of the new policy in advance, which no doubt
explains why the attendance figures dropped from 2,700 last year to 1,739
yesterday.

Any city preparing to host the Olympics quickly becomes involved in the Pork

consult on the myriad facilities for a modern Games. Atlanta is no
exception.
The Dollars 1m design contract for the city's new Atlanta Olympic Tennis
Centre has gone to the locally based Tennis Design Group. This consortium of
four Georgia firms will provide architectural and engineering services for
the 15-court, 20,000-seat complex to be built at Stone Mountain Park.
According to sources within the Atlanta Organising Committee, the factor in
the proposal that was key to the consortium winning the work was a
commitment to allocate 37.2 per cent of all assigned work to black and
female businesses within Atlanta. How this percentage was arrived at is not
revealed in the tender documents.

Meanwhile, digging into the Soviet past in the course of a 10-part series

purports to have unearthed some remarkable facts.
One of the more far-fetched anecdotes hails from a Budapest civil servant
who recalls how Soviet troops, summoned to quash the November 4 1956
uprising, emerged from their tanks - when the fighting was done - asking for
directions to the ocean. Crestfallen to find no briny, one of their number
explained that they thought they were shooting the British in Suez.
Well, Shakespeare's grasp of geography was a little ropy too. Remember The
Winter's Tale, where Bohemia is by the seaside?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While not as risky as playing Russian roulette, being used as a political
yo-yo must have its unnerving aspects. But Yegor Gaidar, who looks to be
undergoing such treatment, showed every sign of thriving on it while wowing
audiences at the London School of Economics this week.
Main architect of Russia's economic reform until last December, he was
sacked by Boris Yeltsin in deference to the conservative parliament. Now
reformists are lobbying the president to lure him back.
Where in the cycle is he placed at the moment? No idea, he says, throwing up
his hands. 'I've been in London for two days and already lost touch with
Moscow intrigue.'
Still, to judge by his LSE account of how he and a few fellow reformers took
swift advantage of the post-coup power vacuum , he could be just the man to
seize the current opportunity.
With the system transfixed by shock in 1991, Gaidar pushed a previously
recalcitrant bureaucracy into slashing the military budget by 70 per cent.
He also cut the budget deficit, headed off hyper-inflation, and forced the
other republics to stop issuing uncontrolled rouble credits.
What he failed to do, however, was curb the powers of the central bank. It
continued to undermine the reformists' tough monetary policy by issuing
cheap rouble credits to the unreformed state enterprises - the same sin of
which national bank chairman Viktor Geraschenko stands accused.
If they succeed, the betting is that the bank job would go to Boris
Fyodorov. But he could be replaced by Gaidar as deputy prime minister in
charge of finance, so bouncing back into his old job.

It was in 1839 that the peasants of south-west Wales, incensed by the cost
of getting their goods to market, disguised themselves in their wives'
nighties and started tearing down the detested toll gates on the roads. The
violence became known as the Rebecca riots after the nom de guerre of the
peasants' leader. British governments have been sensitive on the issue of
road charges ever since.
Undaunted by the lessons of history, Mr John MacGregor, the transport
secretary, wants to bring back tolls. Later this month, or early in the next
one, he is planning to bring out a consultation paper suggesting ways of
charging motorists for using Britain's motorways. He hopes to sell the idea
to motorists by persuading them that they will benefit by higher investment
in new roads. But will motorists be prepared to accept the charges? Or,
perhaps more realistically, will Mr MacGregor's cabinet colleagues?
As the Rebecca riots indicate, toll roads are no new thing in Britain. The
first act for a turnpike road was passed in 1663, based on the principle
that users should pay for the benefits the road brought. By 1830, more than
1,100 turnpike trusts controlled 22,000 miles of toll roads - some 20 per
cent of the national road system.
Certainly the turnpikes were unpopular, but that was not the reason for
their demise. It was the rise of the railways in the 19th century that put
them out of business. One by one, the trusts were wound up, and
responsibility for the road network passed to the state.
As things turned out, the triumph of the railways was to prove short-lived:
cheap and flexible motor transport soon brought traffic back to the roads.
Even so, it was not until the 1980s that the government started looking for
ways of getting private capital interested in building highways again. Now,
pressures on public spending have led to a redoubling of efforts to heave at
least some of the responsibility for the road building programme onto the
shoulders of the private sector.
The seemingly obvious course would be to decide what roads are needed and
then dole out concessions to build and operate them to the private sector,
allowing companies to recoup their investment through tolls. This seems to
work satisfactorily in France, Italy and Spain, where toll roads have
existed for decades. Why not in the UK?
One answer is that companies would stand little or no chance of making a
profit in Britain because their toll roads would face competition from an
existing motorway network that is free at the point of use. Elsewhere in
Europe, toll roads typically provide the only motorway link between one city
and another. Even given this favourable position, few are financially
successful: the overwhelming majority have passed partly or wholly into
public sector ownership over the years, or started out that way in the first
place.
From that disappointing beginning, the next step in the argument is to
suggest eradicating the free competition by putting tolls on the public
sector motorway network, too. This is a highly tempting proposition for any
government, since it not only provides a climate in which the private sector
can take over a chunk of the road building programme, but produces a very
large stream of revenue for the exchequer.
Unfortunately, the proposition founders on the practicality of collecting
the tolls. Private motorways require multi-lane toll plazas, usually at
junctions, to issue motorists with entry tickets and collect money from them
at exits. While it is possible to incorporate these toll plazas into new
motorways, it is impractical to build them into existing ones: the land take
would be vast, particularly in a country like Britain where motorway
junctions are frequent. And while it is sometimes argued that electronic
toll-collecting technology will one day overcome this obstacle, that day is
still many years away.
There is another important issue. The effects of building a new toll road
are quite different from imposing tolls on an existing motorway. In the
first case, the effects are benign to the extent that the new road provides
relief for the existing road network. In the second case, the imposition of
tolls has the reverse effect: it tends to divert cars and lorries off the
existing motorway and onto the free, secondary roads, where they are likely
to do the most damage.
For all these reasons, Mr MacGregor's green paper will almost certainly have
to conclude that pay-as-you-go charges are a non-starter, at least until the
necessary technology is available. Instead, it will end up suggesting a much
simpler solution: the introduction of an annual fee for a permit to drive on
the motorways, with drivers displaying the the permit, or vignette, on their
windscreens.
Such a system is already operating in Switzerland, where anyone wanting to
drive on the motorways has to buy a SFr30 (Pounds 13.50) annual permit,
available at post offices and border crossings. Introduced in 1985, the
scheme is ostensibly aimed at raising funds for the completion of the
motorway network, but it has also had the effect of clobbering the highly
unpopular transit traffic that had previously been getting a free ride on
Switzerland's roads. This was undoubtedly a factor in winning approval for
the scheme in a referendum.
One clear drawback with the vignette system is the unfairness of charging
people the same amount whether they use the motorway once a year or twice a
day. On the other hand, it is easy to introduce and simple to understand; it
is much cheaper to operate than tolls - the Swiss government says only 10
per cent of fees paid are spent on administration; and the Swiss experience
suggests that if the cost of the permit is not too great, most people will
buy one, resulting in a low diversion of traffic from motorways to secondary
roads. (The Swiss say 90 per cent of cars carry vignettes.)
But this still leaves one question unanswered. How are vignettes compatible
with the idea of encouraging the private sector to build toll roads? Few
people would be prepared to pay extra to drive on a private road if they had
already paid a fee for using the state-owned motorway running next to it.
The answer could lie in shadow tolls - a system under which road tolls are
paid not by motorists but by the government, according to the amount of
traffic a private road carries. The effect would be that all roads, public
or private, would remain free at the point of use: but the government would
have a pot of money derived from the vignette and other motoring taxes, and
could allocate it to roads according to the traffic they carried.
Significantly, this would not only provide a means of remunerating the
private sector for building new roads, but open the door to the
privatisation of existing ones.
Attractive though this idea may be to Mr MacGregor, his course is strewn
with obstacles. One of the biggest is the Treasury, for at least two
reasons. The first is that the vignette scheme would blow a hole in firmly
established principles forbidding the hypothecation of revenues - that is,
the notion that any specific tax should be linked to any specific
expenditure. The second is that the Treasury is opposed to shadow tolls
because, by failing to levy the costs of a service directly on the people
who use it, they fail to regulate demand - a point hammered home by
financial secretary Mr Stephen Dorrell at a British Public Works Association
seminar last month.
Other members of the government may have their own reasons for opposing Mr
MacGregor's plans. Some, for example, may like to think they will still be
members of parliament after the next general election. They are likely to
have noted with horror the political furore, and subsequent rethink, that
accompanied Germany's plans to introduce a vignette scheme for the autobahns
next year. In Britain, even before the green paper has come out, the
motoring organisations have mounted a campaign against what they fear is to
come. A poll for the Royal Automobile Club published yesterday showed that
86 per cent of British motorists were hostile to the idea of charges.
Already you can hear the rustle of nighties in the valleys.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Sunday trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OPPONENTS of unrestricted Sunday shop opening will doubtless seek
vindication in the forecast this week by a study for the Home Office that
such a move would create 19,000 job losses. But their claim does not
withstand serious scrutiny. Like much of the special pleading and posturing
which has so far dominated debate on Sunday trading, it can only frustrate
the search for a tidy solution.
Much of the running has been made by trades unions, church groups and larger
retailers unwilling to open on Sundays. Many want legislation to tighten
existing curbs. Justifying this position on religious grounds cannot conceal
its objectionably coercive nature. The minority of regular church goers is
vastly outnumbered by those saying they want freedom to shop on Sundays. In
any case, if any day is to be declared 'special', for Britain's Moslem and
Jewish communities it would certainly not be Sunday.
The more substantive issues concern social welfare, economics and the
consumer interest. Advocates of continued restrictions advance three main
arguments. First, that shopworkers must be protected from a requirement to
work on Sundays. There may be a case for preventing employers from
arbitrarily changing the contracts of existing full-time staff. But there is
no reason why shopworkers should be exempted en bloc from a seven-day work
week when the practice is common in other sectors, including public
transport and the media.
The argument that widespread Sunday trading would reduce competition by
forcing small local shops out of business is equally misconceived. Not only
would deregulation enhance consumer choice and convenience by permitting
more retailers to operate; but the number of small independent shops has
long been in remorseless decline due to shifting social patterns and
retailing costs. The process appears set to continue, whatever happens to
Sunday trading regulations. If it threatens to produce an unhealthy
concentration in the hands of a few large chains, the remedy lies not in
restricting opening hours, but with competition policy.
The third argument, that Sunday trading creates unemployment, is more
complex. The Home Office study suggests that, so far, the reverse may have
been true. It calculates that 45,000 shopworkers now work only or mainly on
Sundays - and would be prime casualties of any tightening of restrictions.
But it also forecasts that full deregulation would result in fewer jobs in
the longer term.
Calculating a precise figure is inevitably a speculative exercise. As the
study points out, retailing is in the grip of sweeping structural and
technological changes which are increasing pressures for productivity growth
and shaking out inefficient capacity. Some job losses are bound to result.
Curbs on Sunday trading will not reverse this trend. But they could thwart
it temporarily - at the cost of inefficiency which must inevitably be paid
for in higher retail prices.
While some of the study's contentions are debatable, its most powerful point
is that protecting or restricting any business sector imposes costs on the
rest of the economy. There are cases when that may be justified. That this
is not one of them is clear from the fact that the most vocal arguments
against freer Sunday trading spring from sectional concerns, not from a
genuine attempt to define the wider public interest.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Personal View: What a difference a decade makes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GREGORY HOELSCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world is full of free advice for the Bundesbank these days, most of it
encouraging a much sharper drop in interest rates. The critics argue that
the German economy is in recession and that the Bundesbank's tight monetary
policy poses a risk not only for Germany but for the rest of Europe too.
This may be true, but the Bundesbank's cautious, measured approach is still
the best policy.
Many in the markets expect a repeat of the experience of August 1982 to
March 1983, when the Bundesbank cut interest rates sharply and quickly.
During this period the discount rate fell from 7.5 to 4.0 per cent, which,
at 50 basis points a month, was twice the rate of decline seen from
September 1992 to the present (even with the larger-than-expected repo rate
cut in April). But the comparison of these two periods is misleading because
the economic climate in Germany was strikingly different in 1982-83.
First, inflation was clearly headed downward; the surge in commodity prices
that led to high inflation in 1980-81 was being reversed in 1982. Also, the
strength of the D-Mark helped the situation. In trade-weighted terms, the
currency was up about 9 per cent in summer 1982 relative to a year earlier.
It rose another 6 per cent by spring 1983. Accordingly, import price
inflation dropped to 1.5 per cent in 1982 from 14 per cent in 1981. Consumer
price inflation peaked at 7.4 per cent in late 1981, and then fell to under
3 per cent by the end of 1983.
Germany's current 4.2 per cent inflation rate is not due to international
commodity price gains. Import prices have fallen since 1989. Instead, higher
wages, service prices, rents and indirect taxes have been the main
contributors to inflation. While wage growth and perhaps service-sector
inflation will slow this year, rents and indirect taxes continue to rise. If
the Bundesbank were to ease rapidly and let the D-Mark fall, imported
commodity price inflation would compound the domestic inflation problem.
A second difference between the early 1980s and today is German fiscal
policy. In 1982 and 1983, in spite of the weak state of the economy and the
loss of a half million jobs during 1981, the government cut real government
expenditures and raised indirect taxes. As a result, the public deficit
declined from a 1981 peak of almost 5 per cent of GNP to about 3 per cent in
1983. This helped to provide a framework in which interest rates could be
cut radically.
The same cannot be said of the present fiscal stance. Following recently
agreed tax increases, the public-sector deficit is expected to improve from
this year's 7 per cent of GDP to 5 per cent by 1995. But that figure is
still high, and therefore the Bundesbank is understandably reluctant to cut
short-term interest rates aggressively.
The current account deficit compounds the problem by making Germany
dependent on foreign capital inflows. Hence there must be a credible policy
framework to attract foreign investors. In contrast, the current account
went from deficit in 1981 to surplus in 1982.
Another difference from 10 years ago is the structure of interest rates  -
both inside and outside Germany. The current German yield curve offers
relatively low-cost financing at the long end. The private sector has
responded by increasing its use of lower cost long-term financing. This
partially mitigates the impact of high short-term interest rates on the
private sector.
By contrast, in summer 1982 when the easing cycle began, the German yield
curve was flat at around the 9 per cent level, meaning that real interest
costs were much higher at the long end of the yield curve. When the
Bundesbank finished easing in 1983, 10-year bond yields were 300 basis
points higher than three-month money rates.
In the second half of 1982, the US Federal Reserve slashed the Federal Funds
rate, allowing the Bundesbank to cut rates without putting extreme pressure
on the D-Mark. This alleviated the fear of adding to imported inflation when
cutting German rates. Currently there is little prospect of further cuts in
US rates, so as the Bundesbank brings down German rates it will become
cheaper to sell D-Marks for dollars. Thus, cautious cuts are the best way to
protect the external value of the German currency.
Finally, it must be remembered that central banks have essentially only one
instrument with which to affect the markets - the level of overnight
interest rates. With but one instrument to work with, it is not possible to
move toward two targets. Anyone who expects the Bundesbank to ignore its own
domestic concerns by cutting interest rates sharply so as to stimulate other
European economies is likely to be disappointed.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Letter: Slide in Tiphook shares shows need for action on
insider deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL MYNERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, On the morning of Thursday, April 29, Tiphook announced that profits
for the year would be below previous expectations. The company's shares had
fallen by 11 per cent during the three days preceding this announcement, a
period when the market was relatively stable.
The prima-facie evidence of insider trading is strong and yet few can have
confidence, on the basis of past experience, that anything concrete will
emerge from any formal investigation instigated by the Stock Exchange.
The time has long passed for a radical review of a process that is clearly
not working. A change of style from the investigator, enhanced resource,
and, possibly, greater co-operation with relevant SROs is required. I have
no doubt that a more robust and structured process would be successful in
identifying wrongdoers and those who act on their behalf.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr E B SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, On May 4 we were at last given access - albeit limited in both time and
number of people - to our offices in Bishopsgate, which were damaged by the
IRA bomb on April 24.
A look at the devastation was distressing; almost as distressing was the
realisation that the premises had been looted. We have learned that theft
from bomb-damaged sites has been widespread.
While I sympathise with the difficulties faced by the police in dealing with
the IRA, I wish they had been able to prevent theft from buildings to which
access has been controlled but which were obviously visited by people who
were apparently diverted from their usual habit of robbing hit-and-run
victims and battlefield casualties.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Letter: Impact of rising yen on Japan trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JOHN WELLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In challenging the wisdom of US leaders 'talking up' the yen and
'talking down' the dollar, your leader (May 1) questions the efficacy of
exchange rate changes in contributing to external adjustment in the
requisite direction. It argues that 'Japanese exports are notoriously
insensitive to price changes', and, referring to recent US trade data, 'so
much for the impact of currency manipulation on the US trade performance'.
Recent empirical evidence is, however, strongly at variance with your views.
Since the yen appreciation of the mid-1980s, Japan has experienced the
smallest increase in manufactured export volume (16.4 per cent) in a sample
of 21 OECD countries - excepting Finland (1.5 per cent), Sweden (8.8 per
cent) and Italy (16.1 per cent) - between 1985-86 and 1991. And this was
following a decade during which Japan has easily outshone its rivals in the
manufacturing export volume. Meanwhile, it is no surprise that the US has
experienced the largest increase (77.9 per cent) since 1985-86.
Of course, yen appreciation is not the only factor responsible for Japan's
poor export showing. Rising real wages have, in addition, made Japan an
expensive location from which to serve global markets - stimulating the
growth of 'transplant' production in both developing and developed countries
 -which voluntary export restraints and other protectionist devices have
also encouraged.
It seems indubitable that currency appreciation can contribute to Japanese
external adjustment in the requisite direction, in both the short and medium
term, by increasing costs in the domestic base and encouraging the export of
Japanese manufacturing capital.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Letter: EBRD is right to develop local units
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANTHONY RICHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'Bank to set up shop in east Europe', (April 27) comes
amid sharp criticism of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
from its member countries. The news that the EBRD will set up more local
institutions in eastern European is, however, a laudable development. It
should be praised for three reasons:
Multilateral lending institutions' development programmes in eastern Europe
should be well-integrated into the client countries' own economic reform
efforts. Joint management boards are a step in the right direction. These
local institutions can give reformers a voice in the development process and
access to critical resources. They can also lead to improved co-ordination
between multilateral and bilateral assistance efforts, an important but
elusive goal.
Cost inefficiency is not just a problem at the EBRD. It affects other
bilateral and multilateral assistance as well. When industrialised nations
are in recession, spending foreign aid carefully must be a priority.
By increasing reliance on field offices and local staff, administrative
costs can be curbed; better matching can also be sought between lending
efforts and the real problems. In those recipient nations plagued by high
inflation and a weak, non-convertible currency, direct investments of hard
currency buy more goods and services than they do in the west. In this way,
on-site, direct lending can promote savings and extend tight international
assistance budgets.
It sends the right message to clients of the bank. For too long, development
has been operated as a 'command economy', putting the needs of lenders and
donors before those of recipients. A greater orientation towards in-country
activities reinforces the spirit of co-operation during painful transition
programmes. Decentralised administration can strengthen the credibility -
and long-term feasibility - of the multilateral lending institutions'
programme.

</HEADLINE>

   From Mr GEORGE SCHOPFLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader on Ukraine ('Nuclear rift over Ukraine', May 5) is
penetrating, but overlooks a key explanatory factor in Kiev's foot-dragging
over nuclear weapons. Russian nationalists have their eyes on Ukraine's
large Russian minority and the areas they inhabit, the Donbas and the
Crimea. The fate of the Bosnian government against the Serbs is perceived as
a parallel and western inactivity is read as a signal that the west would do
nothing for Ukraine in an analogous conflict. The repercussions of the war
of Yugoslav succession go far beyond the frontiers of ex-Yugoslavia.

FT  07 MAY 93 / A new world impasse: Ukraine is increasingly seen by the
west as a 'spoiler' republic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Moscow Club, billed as America's first 'post-cold war thriller', posits
a nightmare scenario: a passionate Ukrainian nationalist works his way to
the top of the Kremlin and from there, with the help of some Americans,
tries to topple the country's democratic leader in an effort to liberate
Ukraine.
In real life, of course, no one is concerned about a covert Ukrainian plot
to destabilise the Russian government. But, from the vantage point of
western, and particularly American, foreign policymakers, Ukraine is
increasingly being seen as the 'spoiler' republic of the former Soviet Union
which is jeopardising western efforts to aid reform in Russia.
On a variety of issues - from nuclear disarmament to rescheduling the
foreign debt of the former Soviet Union - Ukraine has stood in the way of
agreements preferred by both the west and Russia. The sorest point -
Ukraine's hesitation over nuclear disarmament, and its reluctance to ratify
the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start 1), has come to the fore this
week.
Warren Christopher, US secretary of state yesterday discussed the problem of
Ukraine's nuclear weapons at a meeting in the Kremlin. Mr Strobe Talbott,
the top US policymaker on the former Soviet Union, will visit Kiev at the
weekend to step up pressure on Ukrainian leaders to ratify the Start 1
treaty.
The irony is that Ukraine has no desire to become what one western diplomat
in Kiev only half-jokingly described as 'the North Korea on the edge of
Europe'. Ukraine's natural political orientation is towards Europe. However,
the west risks undermining Ukrainian aspirations through what the government
sees as an exclusive focus on Russia and lack of sympathy over Kiev's
national security concerns.
Some officials in Kiev fear Moscow will try to regain control over Ukraine,
having ruled it for more than 350 years before 1991. They argue that the
west, concerned that Ukraine might upset the network of international
disarmament treaties, is more inclined to join forces with Russia in an
effort to pressure Ukraine.
'I don't think this (the nuclear issue) is a real problem, but the world
community, and most of all the US, is helping to create a real problem,'
said Mr Leonid Kuchma, Ukrainian prime minister. The real problem, he says,
is that the 'west is indifferent as to whether we are independent'.
Mr Mykola Mykhalchenko, a senior political adviser to the Ukrainian
president, adds: 'There are forces in Russia which will never reconcile
themselves to Ukrainian independence and will force any Russian government
to put pressure on Ukraine.'
Ukrainian officials have reason to be concerned. The Russian parliament and
the vice-president, Alexander Rutskoi, continue to express territorial
claims towards Ukraine. Moscow has refused to sign a treaty with Kiev
recognising its neighbour's borders as inviolable. Russia's ambassador to
Ukraine has gone so far as to say said that Ukrainian independence is an
ephemeral stage, unlikely to last more than 18 months.
The US has appeared unsympathetic to Ukraine's fears about Russia and has
been much more concerned about nuclear arms. Washington fears that if the
Ukrainian parliament fails to ratify Start 1, last year's Lisbon protocol
which covers the 46 inter-continental ballistic missiles stationed in
Ukraine but not included in the treaty, and refuses to sign the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, the network of international disarmament accords
could unravel. 'The whole arms control structure that we have worked on for
20 years will fall down,' says one US official.
America's reaction to the foot-dragging in Kiev has been, as another US
diplomat puts it, 'to beat up on Ukraine'. American diplomats and technical
advisers to the Ukrainian government say Washington is considering a freeze
on existing funding, such as financing for privatisation auctions.
This tough American stance is playing into the hands of Ukrainian hardliners
who hope to retain nuclear weapons. The west gives Ukraine little financial
assistance and thus has little leverage. But the perception of growing
western hostility is making Ukrainians feel beleaguered, and strengthening
pro-nuclear sentiment.
Although President Kravchuk is committed to a non-nuclear Ukraine, he faces
an increasingly tough battle in pushing the treaties through parliament
where a minority pro-nuclear lobby could force a stalemate.
As a result, it is increasingly likely that the legislature will fudge the
issue. Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, chairman of the parliamentary commission on
foreign affairs and a power-broker in Ukrainian politics, is putting
together a compromise: Ukraine would ratify the Start treaty, but delay
ratification of the Lisbon protocol and accession to the NPT. Such a deal
would leave the 46 ICBMs on Ukrainian soil for an unspecified interim period
before they are destroyed.
Yet why should Ukraine retain a few dozen long-range nuclear missiles, which
Mr Pavlychko admits would be of little military value? The missiles have
symbolic importance, he says: 'It is like having a gun displayed on your
wall. It may have no bullets but when your neighbour comes to dinner he is
afraid of it.'
To avoid painting Ukraine into an anti-western corner, some American
foreign-policy specialists are counselling a shift in approach. Mr Zbigniew
Brezinski, a former head of the National Security Council, has been the most
prominent advocate of a two-pronged strategy in which America would continue
to back reforms in Russia but simultaneously forge a closer relationship
with Kiev.
Winning Ukraine's friendship could be simple: Ukrainian leaders are
pragmatic enough not to expect admission into bodies such as Nato or the EC
anytime soon. What they want is to be treated as a significant regional
power - a desire which could be satisfied by including Ukraine in American -
Russian arms talks, for example - and to receive economic aid, such as
balance of payments support to help the economy adjust to paying world
prices for Russian oil.
For now, American policymakers reject such an approach because they fear it
might antagonise Moscow. Many US officials still hope that Ukraine will fall
under the sway of a democratic, reformist, Russia. But that is not an
acceptable option for Ukraine's leadership. The west thus faces a dilemma:
it can either choose to develop a stronger relationship with an independent
Ukraine, and risk the continuation of regional tensions with Russia, or it
can rebuff Ukrainian aspirations and leave a nuclear power to seek allies
where it can find them.

Sir, Why not choose November 11 as the alternative holiday to May Day? Our
European colleagues would find our celebrating the anniversary of the end of
hostilities an unlooked-for demonstration of community spirit. As the US
also celebrates Veterans Day, there would be minimal disruption to financial

FT  07 MAY 93 / Where comedy is king
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheer up, I have a joke for you. I heard it from Mr David Osborne on
Tuesday. It seems that President Clinton was visiting the US Department of
Agriculture. He marvelled at its long corridors, each with endless rows of
offices leading to the left and right. Passing an open door Mr Clinton saw a
lone official, head on his desk, sobbing.
He turned to the senior USDA officer who was accompanying him and asked why.
'I don't know, sir,' came the reply. 'That man has been with us here at
agriculture for 25 years. He's never complained before.' So the president
put his arm around the pathetic figure and asked what was the matter. The
official looked up, his face stained with tears. 'My farmer died,' he
spluttered.
Mr Osborne, the purveyor of this story, is co-author with Mr Ted Gaebler of
Reinventing Government, the celebrated book reviewed on this page yesterday.
In case you missed it, Osborne &amp; Gaebler are the currently fashionable
prophets of the overthrow of bureaucracy and its replacement by
entrepreneurial management. Their theme has long been in the air in
Australia, New Zealand, Britain and much of the US. The duo must take the
credit for capturing it.
So ends the joke section for today - unless you count the British Labour
party. This ageing pantomime horse is a serious comic. Four times the Tories
have poured buckets of you-know-what over its head, and still it shakes its
big dumb face and floppy ears and trots forlornly around the stage, legs
splayed, mimicking the dances that seemed so popular in 1945. In the early
1980s, when privatisation got rolling, Labour contrived to present itself as
the party of nationalisation. In the 1990s, when managerial reform of the
public sector is the vogue, Labour continues to be perceived as the party of
bureaucracy. This is primarily because it is regarded, with some justice, as
the representative of public-sector unions.
Like all parties of the left, Labour is beached by the tide that went out
with the dissolution of the Communist party of the Soviet Union. There is
now no place for socialism in any form. The French Socialists and the German
Social Democrats have just been painfully reminded of this. All that remains
of the political thought of the past 90 years is an insoluble equation.
Voters demand public services of high quality, but shrink from increased
taxation.
It is an elaborate jest which in Britain seems designed to keep the
Conservatives in power. The prime minister believes that with his citizen's
charter, his opt-outs of schools and hospitals, and his transfer of civil
service backroom work to self-managed agencies he has the patent on
everything in Reinventing Government except the title. Labour's mission
appears to be the maintenance of bureaucracies. It derides Mr Major's
citizen's charter, although it can fairly claim to have originated the
concept. It opposes unfettered competitive tendering, grant-maintained
schools and trust hospitals. It is as if it not only missed the Osborne &amp;
Gaebler bus, it never saw it coming.
In short, you need not trouble yourself with calculations about what today's
by-election result means for Labour, or the Liberal Democrats, or the
government. The government's majority in the Commons is low whether it is
21, including Newbury, or 19, excluding Newbury. The Liberal Democrats gain
nothing but pride from by-election victories; defeats bring only temporary
despondency. The opposition remains split either way. A few local
authorities changing political colour means little now that the Tories have
stripped so much power from the counties.
Our politicians are caught in a monstrous trap, set by Fate. Let me explain.
The Conservatives have adopted only the parts of the anti-bureaucratic book
that suits them. In the US the idea that governments should steer not row -
that they should lay down policy, but contract out its execution to
entrepreneurial units - is pluralistic. Americans elect thousands of
'governments', federal, state, and local. All are ready and able to steer
events within their own areas. All are scrutinised by statute; all have to
perform their duties in the open. That is the law. In Britain there is one
driving seat. Power belongs to Whitehall. The prime minister directs a huge
fleet of appointed boards and committees, an archipelago of patronage. As to
open government, don't make me laugh.
This difference between the British polity and the American one has been
noted by Professor Norman Lewis of Sheffield University in How to Reinvent
British Government, a pamphlet published this week*. 'It would be hypocrisy
to condemn the failure of command economies but to retain all power at the
centre,' he writes. Britain's political system is 'heavily over-centralised,
closed, and has produced a crop of policy failures in recent times that, in
all probability, cannot be matched.' Prof Lewis likes the Osborne &amp; Gaebler
medicine, but understandably finds fault with the patient.
Quite right too. When anyone complains that the Tories have centralised
power, they protest that they have devolved it directly to where it is
exercised - to individual school boards, for example. Parents vote by
choosing schools, thus showing real preferences. It is now clear that this
is a mandarins' confidence trick. If elected local governments devolved
responsibility to autonomous school boards, or if the boards themselves were
elected, that would be decentralisation. What we actually have is the
opposite.
The Labour party understands half of this. Proposals to re-establish local
government and create regional authorities will be discussed at its policy
conclave this weekend. The trap that Fate has constructed for Labour is that
the more it talks of such constitutional reforms, the more it will be
accused of establishing new bureaucracies. This is at least partly its own
fault - it cannot talk convincingly of steering not rowing. For that means
allowing entrepreneurial executives  - independent hospital management
boards, for example - to shed unnecessary employees and make those who
remain work harder. The unions will not permit it. The penalty for Labour is
that it is still seen as the party of one ministry agriculture official per
farmer.

Sir, Many of your readers will have been astounded by Christopher Lorenz's
comments on football club management ('A lovable bully falls from grace',
May 1). It is, he asserts, 'in a somewhat lesser league than the tasks which
such big-time players (Margaret Thatcher, Lord King, Robert Horton)
perform.' Surely he is familiar with the words usually ascribed to the late
Bill Shankly, sometime of Liverpool Football Club: 'Some people think that
football is a matter of life and death - but it's much more important than
that'?

FT  07 MAY 93 / Arts: Old Masters in Oxford - Patricia Morison visits Christ
Church picture gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1765, General John Guise, redoubtable soldier and lover of art, gave his
extremely fine collection of Italian paintings and drawings to his old
college, Christ Church. Never had, nor has, an Oxford college received such
a bequest. It includes a wonderful 'Virgin and Child with Three Angels' by
an artist very close to Piero della Francesca; Hugo Van der Goes's
'Lamentation', which is all the more moving for being but a fragment;
Annibale Carracci's 'Butcher Shop'; Tintoretto's 'Martyrdom of St Lawrence';
and Van Dyck's powerfully arresting oil sketch, the 'Soldier on Horseback'.
The list of Old Master paintings could be far longer. And then there is the
world-famous Christ Church collection of drawings, selections from which are
displayed throughout the year.
In the early summer, two modest exhibitions examine certain puzzles arising
from General Guise's benefaction. Carlo Ridolfi, Collector and Art Historian
(until July 6) is a footnote show about a figure much honoured among
students of the Italian Renaissance. A professional painter and scholar,
Ridolfi (1594-1658) stands to Venetian historiography as Vasari does to
Florence. Like Vasari, he was not much of a painter - or so it is said.
(When next in Venice, I mean to track down what is supposedly his best work
in San Giovanni Elemosinario.) As for seeing how he measured up to Vasari as
a historian, the problem is that there is no modern edition, let alone
translation, of Ridolfi. And yet, his Life of Tintoretto and Le Meraviglie
dell'arte are key works, written out of patriotic indignation that Vasari
had been so pro-Florentine and showed so little appreciation of the
'marvels' achieved by Venetian artists.
One of General Guise's coups was to buy Ridolfi's collection of drawings, or
at least a sizeable chunk of it. Scholars are now satisfied that the general
really did secure this collection and was not, as had been suggested,
tricked by an elaborate forger. The cloud of doubt arises from the fact that
the bound volumes which Ridolfi made were dismembered by some dim college
Librarian in the last century.
That said, with some exceptions the drawings we see in the exhibition are
not particularly remarkable. The reason for showing them is that they are
marked 'R' in Ridolfi's hand, or with a different 'R' added in the 18th
century. Many great drawings in the collection may actually have been
Ridolfi's but are unmarked. However, 'The Archer' is both a fascinating and
exceedingly rare work. It was made with the point of a brush by a late
14th-century artist now identified as French, the Master of the Parement of
Narbonne. There is also a small Leonardo study of a sleeve bound with
fluttering ribbon, and a tiny sketch of figures for the background in
Carpaccio's St Ursula cycle.
The second Christ Church show (until June 15) focuses on a Titian which is
not normally on view, 'The Adoration of the Shepherds'. Dark and damaged
though the picture is, it repays a long look. Titian's composition conveys
the quality of worshipful repose normal in a Nativity, and yet he also
included the energetic figure of a shepherd tugging at his donkey. Another
shepherd doffs his hat as he kneels, and two boys hang over the back wall of
the stable, peering by the light of their candle at the holy infant.
Again, General Guise had invested in a good provenance. The picture had been
in Charles I's celebrated collection, he having bought it from the duke of
Mantua. The Oxford painting has hitherto been described as a version of the
'Adoration' which was commissioned from Titian by the Duke of Urbino,
brother-in-law to the Duke of Mantua. This picture, now in the Pitti Palace,
is a wreck. However, the exhibition makes the suggestion that the Christ
Church picture is the original and that the Pitti Palace is the later one.
Recent X-ray examination of the Oxford picture has revealed paint applied
with a Titianesque bravura which could make the picture 'of great interest'
if it were cleaned.
And there the matter is likely to rest. These are lean times for Oxford
colleges. Christ Church already faces a pressing question over the
deteriorating condition of its superb Van Dyck, 'The Continence of Scipio':
the bill for conservation is estimated at around Pounds 20,000. These are
considerations to be borne in mind, while the public still continues to
enjoy access to this remarkable private collection.
Christ Church Picture Gallery is open Monday-Saturday 10.30-1.00 and
2.00-5.30; closed Sunday morning. Guided tours, Thursday at 2.15

FT  07 MAY 93 / Arts: 'Shaw talk' on 'Getting Married' - Chichester Festival
Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
George Bernard Shaw claimed that he wrote Getting Married as a revenge on
the critics for not liking serious work. It was to be played for nearly
three hours without an interval. There was to be no plot, only in the
classical sense of the term, an argument: in other words, 'nothing but talk,
talk, talk, talk - Shaw talk'. There were, however, to be a few concessions:
the curtains would be dropped from time to time to allow first-aid to be
given to really bad cases in the press seats; and that Charing Cross
Hospital would have an ambulance available in case of need.
It was a very good Shaw joke. Getting Married is a wonderfully funny comedy,
sometimes bordering on farce, and it does have a plot in that most of the
characters either get or stay married in the end. The new departure for Shaw
was simply that it observed the classical unities of time and place: all the
action takes place on a fine spring morning in the Norman kitchen in the
Palace of the Bishop of Chelsea in 1908. There are no gaps in the action or
the talk.
Chichester is the right place for a revival. There is a bishop's palace just
across the road which has had some remarkable occupants over time. Alfred
Bridgenorth, the Bishop of Chelsea in Shaw's play, would have been at home
there. An intellectual and spiritual man, he has five daughters, is about to
marry the last of them off, but is worried about the state and role of
marriages made on earth. Despite having spoken to four successive prime
ministers on the need for easier divorce, nothing has been done. He has been
praying for 20 years that the crisis will not erupt within his own
household, but it does. On the morn of the ceremony daughter No 5 reads a
pamphlet about the inequities of the marriage law and decides to call it
off. So, to her surprise, does the groom.
The play includes, as Shaw said, a lot of talk about the advantages and
otherwise of the married state. It is also full of characters. The bishop,
played by Tony Britton, is a very unusual man, full of learning, wisdom and
charity. Whenever he speaks, everyone hangs on to his words with the
possible exception of his wife who may have heard them all before.
The bishop has two brothers: an army general (Christopher Benjamin) who is
hopelessly in love with the bishop's sister-in-law - since she is called
Lesbia, it is not surprising that she holds him off - and a City-type called
Reggie (Moray Watson) married to a bright young thing 30 years his junior
who wants to leave him for a character straight out of Oscar Wilde: St John
Hotchkiss. One wonders, with a name like that, if it is not a reference to
Shaw's contemporary playwright, St John Hankin.
All that is fine, though it begins to flag after about 80 minutes. Then the
director, Frank Hauser, does the decent thing. He introduces an interval and
on the verge of half-time in comes Dorothy Tutin.
Ms Tutin is a key figure in the second act, as we knew from the moment she
appeared that she would be. She plays the sister-in-law of the greengrocer
who looks after the domestic arrangements for the wedding, such as the
breakfast, the cake and the placement. She is also the local mayor, a
clairvoyant and the writer of pseudonymous love letters to the bishop,
hoping that they will meet in heaven. St John Hotchkiss, despite his wildly
different social origins, has worshipped her before and does so again. The
bishop takes her more or less in his stride, but even he is mildly surprised
when she hears voices. Ms Tutin's is an inspired performance and an inspired
piece of casting: Joan of Arc with jokes and also some passion.
I disagree with Patrick Garland's programme note that the subject is so
contemporary the play could have been written today: one of the many
pleasures is that some of the bishop's pleas for reform have since been
adopted. But it is still a splendid piece.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Arts: Solti's Bruckner - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the Barbican on Wednesday, the London Symphony played splendidly for Sir
Georg Solti in Bruckner and Stravinsky. The latter's wartime Symphony in
Three Movements has been a Solti party-piece these many years; not because
he does sensational tricks with it, but because he knows how to sustain its
sinewy tensions from start to finish. Most performances let them go slack at
one place or another; here it never did.
A favourite critical epithet for Solti performances is 'hard-driven'; but
there is a distinction between forcing a piece like this one violently
along, and what he actually did - which was simply to ensure that every
rhythmic cell strained forward toward the next, holding our attention taut.
A further result was that the 'affirmative' ending felt much more like an
honestly earned release than it usually does. The concertante piano and harp
were fine; for pungent character, however, it was the first clarinet who
stood out. The baritone gurgles that Stravinsky assigned him as punctuation,
here and there, were delectably funny and knowing.
It was enlightening about Solti to hear him conduct Bruckner's Fourth
Symphony, the 'Romantic', just six weeks after Herbert Blomstedt had led his
crack San Francisco band through it on the South Bank. That was a hugely
efficient performance, but steely and unyielding in effect. Though Solti was
as always pretty urgent, and at a generally high dynamic level, his brassy
climaxes were never abrasive. If he made less of Bruckner's bosky, evocative
intimations than (say) Klaus Tennstedt does, his cooler reading of the
Andante was eloquent and most scrupulously graded.
Nothing much like Tennstedt's chiaroscuro, but persuasively articulate over
a wide, subtly calibrated spectrum: Solti conducted the strictly musical
argument with elan. With the San Francisco comparison fresh in mind, one
could appreciate the lyrical flexibility of his beat (despite appearances),
and his gift for engineering 'spontaneous' dramatic contrasts that did not
sound engineered. All those laborious chromatic ascents in the symphony were
rendered fluid, where hard-edged American precision had exposed them as
mechanical - and he left room for folksy Austrian dance-echoes too, which
had been Greek to the San Franciscans. That was nice. Even music of elevated
ambitions may trade upon local accents that cannot be translated into
standard, cosmopolitan notation.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Arts: Cyril Huve - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To his Wigmore Hall debut on Tuesday the young French pianist Cyril Huve
brought not just himself but his piano as well - an 1828 Pleyel, beautifully
cased, expertly restored, and a pleasure to hear in every note it produced.
Chopin favoured (according to the New Grove) the 'suavity' of the
contemporary best French pianos, and particularly the Pleyel. In this
concert one heard why - and was led, in Huve's group of Chopin pieces,
through a treasure-house of sounds utterly beguiling, intimate,
many-coloured and 'personal' in character.
From an ear trained by the dominance and predominance of the modern Steinway
to expect a pianist's smoothly processed homogeneity of tone, reliable
evenness of finger-action and limitless and near-uniform carrying-power, the
first few minutes of the recital demanded mental adjustment. But once that
was made - and it was, easily and quickly - constant refreshment was brought
by the instrument to Chopin's lyrical lines and his figuration. The
distinctness of the Pleyel's registers prevented any rigid, automatic
repetitiveness in either the singing or the accompanying of Chopin melodies.
Chopin as great harmonic adventurer was a proposition here eloquently
argued.
An instrument is in the end, of course, only as rewarding to encounter as
the person who plays it. Huve made this a rewarding encounter; but I gained
the impression that on another, more relaxed evening he would surely make it
even more so. In the opening pieces - C minor Nocturne, B minor Scherzo, A
flat Ballade - there were constant smudges and fluffs; and to add to these,
in the closing Op. 28 Preludes, a number of memory-lapses.
But even when rising above these, as he did for long stretches of the B flat
minor Sonata, one gained no very certain intimation that for Huve the
playing of a Chopin piano had afforded a powerful revelation of authentic
Chopin style. Rhythm was seldom treated sufficiently freely; melodies lacked
the spontaneous, singing rubato for which Chopin was unrivalled. Huve is
obviously a lively, engaged, sensitive artist; he also has imaginative ideas
about programming - for instance, switching at midpoint to the Wigmore
modern grand for an account of James Dillon's angularly poetic Spleen
(1979-80), an invigorating notion in itself and a source of teasing
contrasts and historical reflections.

based in France, rarely tours the UK. Its production of Romeo and Juliet at
Seaford and Brighton opens the Brighton Arts festival. So here is an
opportunity to see this remarkable multi-cultural itinerant theatre
collective.
Footsbarn has no director, so the production evolves through individual
contribution and unified effort. The resulting Shakespeare, Footsbarn's
sixth, emerges as an ensemble piece. The heavily-cut text abjures the
intimacies and psychological consistencies of the play, but finds something
grander at the close, where there is no speech in the entire scene at the
Capulet tomb.
The play opens with a heap of corpses from the families, masked and
spattered in mud. They rise and stay in the action throughout as spirits
like the Furies or Eumenides. They become garden statues when Romeo first
climbs the balcony, and they are waifs in purgatory welcoming Mercutio the
grave man.
Action and reaction happen physically, viscerally. The news of Juliet's
death sends Romeo scudding over the stage assaulted by the emotion.
Mercutio's 'Queen Mab' speech concentrates on what can be represented
visually, so there are no lawyers' fees or courtiers' favours in the verse,
since they are too abstract. And Romeo and Juliet first meet in a backlit
puppet show, no dialogue, just gesture.
Eerie stringed accompaniment and fierce bursts of percussion punctuate the
action. The energy keeps the plot moving, with plenty of low comedy from the
Nurse and Friar Lawrence. Romeo and Juliet themselves are young enough to be
innocent, and the bellicose Tybalt and elegant Paris are never more
themselves than this.
If Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet seems unrecognisable, then the company
aims at and achieves an archetype, pared of personality and purged of
psychology. There are no leads, no stars, just the production. The effect
works collectively on the spectators, too. The theatre is a large
black-lined tent, the seats bleachers, and the lights powered by a
distantly-humming generator. One feels party to as well as part of the show.
And the atmosphere negotiated between actors and audience is what makes the
evening worth seeing.
At Seaford and Brighton until May 20 (Brighton Festival 0273 674357)

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Anthea Rose has been appointed chief executive of the Chartered Association
of Certified Accountants.
She takes on the top job at the Association after five years as deputy chief
executive, and the last few months as acting chief executive since the
sudden death of Andrew Sansom last year.
She will help steer and consolidate the operations of the body, which has
more than 39,000 members and over 90,000 students in 130 countries.
Rose says her priorities include continuing the Association's important
international role, particularly in south-east Asia and other parts of the
developing world. She also wants to develop the profile of the body
throughout the UK, and work towards greater co-operation with the other
leading accountancy bodies in the country.
Before joining the association in 1977, she worked as an administrator at
Kent University and the Open University, and as a personnel manager with
Beecham Pharmaceuticals.
Rose's appointment was announced at the Association's agm yesterday. The
meeting also elected Kenneth Duncan, director of taxation with Duracell
Europe, as president for the coming year.
The vice president is Professor Michael Harvey, who teaches at the London
Guildhall University, and the deputy president is John Moore, a partner in
Mooney Moore, a practice based in Belfast.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Technology: Germany takes stock - Frankfurt is trying to
shake off its Wild West image and become Europe's financial centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Frankfurt's financial community, ambition is certainly not in short
supply. Just before Rudiger von Rosen discovered that he was to be replaced
as chief executive of the Deutsche Borse - which came into being at the
beginning of the year - he said in a speech that Frankfurt must aim to
displace London as Europe's financial centre.
Von Rosen argued that Frankfurt had the means to do this because Finanzplatz
Deutschland - Germany as a financial centre - had more sophisticated
technology than the competition in London.
Ironically, the appointment of Werner Seifert to replace him served only to
make this analysis look more pertinent. Seifert, a former partner at
McKinsey, the management consulting firm, is taking over precisely because
of the importance of technology to the future of the Finanzplatz.
The Deutsche Borse, which acts as a holding structure, brings the Frankfurt
Stock Exchange - the largest by far of Germany's eight exchanges - under one
roof with the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB) - Germany's screen-based futures
and options exchange - and the Kassenverein settlements organisation.
Germany's seven regional stock exchanges still enjoy independent lives. But
they participate in the new structure to the extent that they own 10 per
cent of the new structure between them and that technology developed by
Deutsche Borse will be made available to them all.
'We now have one organisation to handle the entire range of stock exchange
business,' says Rolf Breuer, the chairman of the exchange and board director
responsible for capital markets at Deutsche Bank.
'Right from the beginning of the process of placing an order, to the end
where the order is wound up, the client need only deal with one
organisation. The whole process has been brought under one roof - for
derivatives as well as for securities - something you don't find in London,
Paris or New York.'
At present, the practical benefits of the new structure for the client of a
German bank or broker are few. It will be the job of Seifert, who takes over
as chief executive in August, to breathe life into the new legal structure.
'This will require pure management skills,' says Breuer. 'The organisations
which form the Deutsche Borse are merged together legally but not working
together properly. His (Seifert's) job will be to make it all work.'
Von Rosen is a former head of the Bundesbank's press office who became
managing director of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in 1988. Breuer credits
him with doing an excellent job in fighting the political battles necessary
to bring the new stock exchange structure into existence.
'But the job is a totally different one now,' Breuer says.
Even before the creation of Deutsche Borse, the development of technology
had a high priority for Germany's financial community:
More than DM100m (Pounds 41.6m) has been spent on setting up and developing
the DTB, which celebrates its third anniversary in January. The number of
contracts handled by the exchange rose from 6.8m in 1990 to 34.8m last year,
confounding critics who said that a screen-based system would not function
in hectic market conditions.
Some DM50m has also been deployed to develop Boss-Cube, a system designed to
eliminate the flow of paper involved in making an order to buy or sell
securities. This was introduced at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange earlier this
year and it is set to be extended to other exchanges in the future.
Around DM16m has been spent on developing IBIS, a screen-based dealing
system for 37 leading equities and a number of important fixed-income
issues. Since it was introduced in April 1991, this has won more than 30 per
cent of the market in stocks represented on Frankfurt's 30-share DAX index
and become what the head of the equity derivatives department of a leading
London investment bank concedes is 'the benchmark system for dealing in
bigger German stocks'.
Settlement procedures have been refined to the point where a buy or sell
order can, in many cases, be settled within 24 hours, in all cases within 48
hours. This is markedly quicker than in London where settlement takes place
up to three weeks after a trade occurs.
The idea is that future technological developments will reap the synergies
between these different projects. For example, following the recommendations
of a study conducted by McKinsey last year, the exchange is likely to
implement a more extensive electronic dealing system for shares and fixed
interest securities from the middle of the decade. The technology for the
new system will be modelled on IBIS and on the settlement systems already
developed for the DTB.
Yet for some market participants, the emphasis on technology misses the
point.
'All this high-tech is quite impressive,' says Reinhard Winkler, head of the
London-based Rhine Securities research house. 'But what is really needed to
improve the Finanzplatz is a set of laws which bring market practices in
Germany into line with the status quo in the UK and the US. There needs to
be a change of emphasis, a new focus on strengthening the rights of small
shareholders.
'There is a danger that the German market will degenerate into a form of
electronic casino, well-equipped for the needs of professional traders but
ignoring the interests of genuine long-term investors,' he argues.
As Winkler points out, Germany still lacks a law against insider dealing,
has no takeover code and no meaningful rules on the disclosure of share
stakes, all of which gives a flavour of the Wild West to takeover activity
in Germany.
The principle that all shareholders should be treated equally is not an
ingrained part of Germany's financial culture.
Breuer concedes the justice of the criticism, blaming the government for
delays in introducing the necessary legislation. Under EC legislation a law
against insider dealing should have been on the statute books last summer.
But this is unlikely to be enacted before the middle of next year.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Technology: Printers' colourful future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The black-only computer printer is going to fade into obscurity, in common
with the black-and-white television set, according to market data gathered
by Hewlett-Packard, the leading manufacturer of laser and ink-jet printers.
Until recently, most computer users regarded colour printers as an expensive
luxury that they were hard pressed to justify. A serious drawback was that
most colour printers could not produce high-quality black print.
That is changing rapidly, however, with the advent of low-cost colour
printers that offer the same print quality and speed as their black
predecessors.
Colour printing provides a means of producing documents on plain paper that
include, for example, a company's logo. It is also increasingly used as a
means of highlighting text or printing out paper copies of colour slides.
Colour printers represented about 11 per cent of the total 21 million
computer printers sold last year worldwide, up from slightly more than five
per cent in 1991.
The fastest growing segment of the printer market is personal computer
colour ink-jet printers, with sales of 1.2m units last year, up 235 per cent
from 1991.
By 1997, HP, which dominates this segment, predicts that black printers will
account for only about 12 per cent of its ink-jet printer business, compared
with about 64 per cent today.
The market is being driven, HP says, by the appeal of colour printing at
only a modest premium over conventional black printers.
The latest addition to HP's range is a colour office printer. The 1200C,
available initially in Europe, produces colour printed pages at a rage of
seven per minute. It is priced at Dollars 1,389 (Pounds 926).
A version incorporating the Postscript print language is available for
Dollars 1,939.
In an unusual move for the US-based company, HP has launched its new printer
in Europe first, where it sees stronger demand for colour printers than in
the US.
Other companies that have introduced colour printers this year include Apple
Computer, Seiko, Laser Master and Nikon.

The technology to send divers to the seabed clad only in a metal suit is the
stuff of science fiction programmes. But a patented rotary joint means such
suits are a flexible - and less expensive - alternative to robotic vehicles
for repairing oil rig damage at depths of over 300 metres.
Developed by International Hard Suits, of Vancouver, the Newtsuit has some
20 fluid-filled rotary joints, which the company estimates gives the diver
90 per cent of his or her normal dexterity. A thruster pack allows divers to
change direction. UK marine contractor Rockwater is supplying Newtsuit-clad
divers as a service to the offshore oil industry. International Hard Suits:

FT  07 MAY 93 / Technology: Letting the wind take the strain - Worth
Watching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rain, wind and blizzards frequently occur in the highlands of Scotland. But
ScotRail is turning the extreme weather conditions to its advantage.
At the remote station of Corrour travellers used to wander in the dark if
their trains arrived after dusk because the station had no electricity. The
station now has an automatic lighting system which uses wind to power it.
Developed by Proven Engineering Products, of Kilmarnock, the turbine on its
6.5-metre mast charges a bank of batteries which powers the lights. A sensor
determines when artificial light is needed, while a timer illuminates the
station half an hour before each evening train is due. Proven Engineering:

FT  07 MAY 93 / People: Barber picks Pictet
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stephen Barber, who resigned from Invesco MIM at the end of March, is
teaming up with his longstanding colleague and friend Nicholas Johnson at
Swiss private bankers Pictet.
Barber, 38, who was chief executive of Invesco's unit trust operation, joins
as executive director of the two London companies, Pictet Asset Management
UK and Pictet International Management.
Johnson and Barber have worked together for some 13 years. The former joined
Pictet, as chief investment officer, from Invesco earlier this year.
'Pictet wants to build a global institutional fund-management business based
in London,' explains Barber, pointing out that the group's funds under
management - around Dollars 30bn globally - are currently dominated by
private client monies. French and German speaking countries will still be
handled from the Geneva headquarters.
Barber exchanges the turmoil at Invesco for the rarified atmosphere of a
Swiss banking partnership where he has already met six of the seven
partners.
A fluent Japanese speaker who spent five years in Japan for Invesco, Barber
says he will oversee the Asian equity business and the quantitative side as
well as becoming involved in general management issues.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Management: Oxford backs NVQs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The success of National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) - particularly at
higher management levels - is still unproven. So the decision earlier this
year to grant awarding body status to a department of Oxford University,
should give NVQs a useful boost.
NVQs are a competence-based set of vocational qualifications which seek to
span the whole gamut of qualifications from low-skill occupations to
management and the professions.
It is a radical move by Oxford University to enter into the vocational
education field, not least when some universities argue that they should not
be tainted by vocational qualifications.
Research among leading companies by Oxford's Delegacy of Local Examinations
(UODLE) - a university department - has shown that NVQ competence-based
assessment plays a relatively minor role in internal management development
at the moment.
But Alan Wilmott, director of the UODLE, is confident more companies will
begin to realise the advantages of NVQs at higher levels.
NVQs, he says, should not be regarded as the poor relation of traditional
management diplomas and MBAs. 'The method of assessment is different but
they are not a lesser form of achievement.'
Involvement in NVQs, says Wilmott, is a natural extension of his unit's work
in educational assessment and its more recent role in validating in-company
development programmes.
The UODLE was established in 1857 and has since established itself as one of
the main awarding bodies for examinations outside the university, including
GCSE, AS and A Levels and English as a Foreign Language. In the 1980s UODLE
decided to explore other commercial areas where it believed its expertise in
assessment and validation could be applied. Hence the interest in NVQs.
At present two other organisations, the Royal Society of Arts and the
Business and Technology Education Council, are also awarding bodies for
these management qualifications.

FT  07 MAY 93 / The Property Market: The reluctant landlord - Hanson's
acquisitions in the 1980s have helped it build one of the UK's biggest
property banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With some Pounds 4bn of assets, Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, is
Britain's second biggest property company, according to a survey last year
by DTZ Debenham Thorpe. But it is a reluctant corporate landowner. 'We never
went out and bought a property company. We have acquired property by
default,' says Mr Malcolm Ablett, managing director of Hanson Properties.
Apart from a brief flirtation last summer with the notion of buying Canary
Wharf, the troubled Olympia and York development in London, Hanson has
rarely set out to add to its property portfolio in the UK or the US, where
it also has substantial assets. Instead, it has built up its property assets
through an aggressive policy of acquisitions of non-property companies.
These began in 1983 with the purchase of London Brick, which owned large
clay and gravel reserves and agricultural estates of some 100,000 acres in
south-east England.
In the same year, Hanson bought UDS, a retail group with a portfolio of
2,000 stores. These included Whiteleys department store in west London,
which at the time was trading at a loss. Hanson closed Whiteleys, won
planning permission for a redevelopment and sold the site to Arlington for
Pounds 18m.
In 1985, Hanson took over the Imperial Group, which brought with it, among
other things, the Courage brewing estate. The estate included the site of
Shakespeare's Globe theatre in Southwark, along with a adjacent terrace of
listed Georgian houses. The future of this historically important site has
provoked intense controversy (even though the most controversial proposal of
all - a plan by American tycoon Donald Trump to build an 80-storey office
tower on the site - was never pursued).
The development of the Globe site has been stymied by a debate among
conservationists over whether to destroy the Georgian houses so as to
excavate the remains of the Globe. At present, the anti-excavation camp, is
winning the argument; Hanson may find new uses for the Georgian houses,
either as flats or a hotel. Meanwhile the back of the site is due to be
turned into a car park.
In 1989 Hanson bought Consolidated Gold Fields, which through its subsidiary
ARC, an aggregates company, owned a property development arm and gravel
pits. The most recent addition to Hanson's holdings came with the 1991
acquisition of Beazer, the building products group. The Beazer purchase
brought with it a large estate management business and investment portfolio.
Hanson is not sentimental about its large property bank. 'Our sole objective
is to turn assets into cash,' says Mr Ablett.
Some portfolios have been sold in their entirety; the UDS stores were sold
long ago; as was the village of Stewartby near Bedford, which was built by
London Brick. Others are proving more difficult to sell. As a result of the
Beazer and ARC takeovers, for instance, Hanson inherited three empty office
blocks in Bracknell, one of the most over-developed towns in the south-east.
Before its takeover by Hanson, ARC had also undertaken a lot of business
park development, which came to fruition just when recession took hold in
1989. 'The timing was terrible,' says Mr Ablett. Hanson has also held onto
most of the investment portfolio, including shopping centres, it inherited
from ARC and Beazer. Hanson is likely to start selling its shopping centres
following the recent pick-up in interest in this sector of the market.
Hanson owns shopping centres in Bath, Stroud and Newcastle and has stakes in
centres in Middlesborough, Leeds and Hull.
The most significant of Hanson's remaining assets is its land bank: 100,000
acres of land in the south-east, which belonged to ARC and London Brick.
Selling the land will take a long time. First, Hanson does not want to flood
the market. Second, it wants to add value to its land bank by winning
planning permission before putting it on the market.
The case for addressing planning questions has become more urgent as a
result of recent changes to the planning regime, which lay down the
framework for planning decisions for the next 10 years. 'We do not want to
miss the boat,' says Mr Ablett.
The most recent planning exercise undertaken by Hanson was a nine-month
review of ARC's land holdings. Each parcel of land had to be examined and
reviewed for its development potential. 'We recovered the cost of the review
in its eighth or ninth week,' says Mr Ablett.
But Hanson's most elaborate exercise in adding value to its land is at
Peterborough, where it owns a large area of land left derelict following the
extraction of brick clay. After eight years of preparatory work, it has won
planning permission for the Pounds 500m Peterborough Southern Township - the
largest private-sector new town since the first stages of Welwyn Garden
City.
On the 2,000-acre site, Hanson has planning consent for 3m square feet of
commercial and industrial space, a retail park, two supermarkets and housing
for 13,000 people. Hanson says it has already had some interest from
developers, mostly for warehouses. None the less, it expects the development
of the township to take more than a decade.
'We have to be realistic,' says Mr Ablett. 'We realise this is a longer term
project. It won't produce vast sums in the short term.' Although Hanson
Properties usually shuns development, it does not rule out joint venture
developments. 'It may be that to kick-start the project, we have to be
flexible. We are prepared to talk to anyone.'
If and when a partner is selected for the Peterborough venture, it is
unlikely to be the Beazer housebuilding arm. The Hanson divisions are kept
at arms' length; no division is asked to subsidise another. 'We don't
believe in robbing Peter to pay Paul,' says Mr Ablett.
Hanson Properties is also heavily involved in trying to extract value from
the land used within its businesses. The efficient management of property is
central to the philosophy of a company which prides itself on gaining
maximum value from its assets.
Reviews of operational assets are made at a local level, although there are
instances where Hanson Properties would become involved 'to help their
management thinking'.
That said, Mr Ablett is anxious to dispel any notion that the property arm
is a significant overhead for Hanson. The property management is contracted
out to agents, while the head office employs just 30 property staff,
including accountants and secretaries.
The overriding impression given by Hanson is that property is as much a
painful necessity as a potential source of value. 'We are not long-term
holders of property,' says Mr Ablett. 'Our role is to convert what we have
into cash, not to add to it.'

FT  07 MAY 93 / Management: The subtle art of learning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LITTLE learning is a dangerous thing in every walk of business life, but
nowhere more than in 'strategic alliances'. Collaboration with friends and
foes alike is now a key part of almost every company's competitive strategy.
Hence the emergence of the ghastly term 'virtual corporation' to describe
shifting networks of companies which share costs and skills.
For each enterprise involved, the ability to extract knowledge and
capabilities from its partner is becoming vital to survival.
Yet, with honourable exceptions such as Rover in cars and Motorola in
electronics, few western companies are anything like as adept at such
learning as the Japanese groups with which they so often ally. This is not
just because the Japanese are inveterate learners, but because the rest of
us are either blind or inept.
Consider the case of 40 hard-pressed American car component makers which set
up joint ventures with Japanese partners in the late 1980s to improve their
languishing profitability and to gain business from Japanese 'transplant'
factories in the US.
For all but eight of the companies, 'learning from our partner' was an
explicit objective. Yet after five years half of them complained that they
were learning next to nothing. In almost all cases the reason was not that
the Japanese had erected any particular barrier, but simply that the
Americans were incapable of learning - whether as individuals,
organisations, or both.
The reasons for this are illuminating. They get to the heart not only of
alliance relationships, but also of the equally pressing question for any
kind of change management, even within single companies: why 'organisational
learning', though fashionable, is such a tricky process.
Enlightenment on both issues comes courtesy of a joint study venture between
a Canadian professor who specialises in the fast-growing field of
organisational learning, Mary Crossan of Western Business School, Ontario,
and an American strategy researcher, Andrew Inkpen of Temple University in
Philadelphia.
In a working paper with the intriguing title of Believing is Seeing - as
opposed to the often mistaken convention that 'seeing is believing' -
Crossan and Inkpen say that deep-seated managerial beliefs can obscure even
the most visible lessons about one's partner's way of doing things. But they
also argue that many Japanese skills are far from immediately visible to the
average western eye.
Whereas most previous research into learning from alliances has been done at
the level of the company, Crossan and Inkpen probe at three levels:
individual learning; sharing it with colleagues and the parent company's
managers; and the transformation of such 'group learning' into fully-fledged
learning across the whole organisation.
Most of the individual US managers set out expecting to find easily
observable chunks of 'what' the Japanese knew. But instead, most of it was
embedded in their ways of organising and competing. To take two trite
examples, practices such as paying on time and 'shipping 7,200 parts, not
7,201' meant far less on their own than they did as part of the Japanese
partner's overall approach to 'doing everything right'.
The Americans also failed to appreciate that much of what they saw, though
apparently insignificant, had a considerable cumulative effect thanks to
continuous improvement. Instead, they looked in vain for 'home runs'.
Where things really got tough was when it came to turning individual
learning into the shared variety and then exploiting it.
For a start, all the companies suffered from the 'Chinese whispers'
syndrome: the way that, in all but the best-managed organisation, individual
learning is dissipated as it winds its way up the organisation. At every
level, pieces of knowledge and information get distorted or disappear.
Matters were made far worse by the fact that few of the parent companies in
the study had any real mechanism for feeding information, or the people who
carried it, back to them. 'Many companies were unwilling to incur the
minimal expense of setting up learning arrangements such as sending key
parent managers to the joint venture regularly to get first-hand
experience,' say the researchers.
In some cases this may have been because, regardless of their organisation's
stated objective, managers in the parent company tended to see the joint
venture as a way of filling a skills gap, not as a bridge to learning new
ones.
So long as the joint venture remained unprofitable - which was often quite a
while - most of the parent company managers also refused to commit
themselves to any lessons from it, or even to try them out.
In typically short-termist American fashion, they measured the venture's
performance only by its profitability, whereas the Japanese partner focused
on non-financial measures such as rising product quality and customer
satisfaction.
Even when there was clear evidence to the contrary, the parent company's
managers were loath even to consider the possibility that 'the child could
outperform its parent'. They felt threatened by the learning and blocked it.
You might think that this bunch of executives was unusually blind or stupid.
Yet their sort of behaviour is all too typical of the 'defensive routines' -
conscious and unconscious - identified in all kinds of companies by other
learning specailists.
As has been demonstrated time and time again, people find it far harder to
learn and therefore to change, than they either realise or admit. The car
component managers are not complete dunces, but extreme versions of
ourselves.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Management: Pin stripes to jeans - Martin Dickson looks at a
growing US trend to casual dress at work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It must be Friday because Bill Marx, head of AT&amp;T's network systems
division, is pacing his New Jersey office in one of his awesome golfing
sweaters.
And down the corridor in the public relations department you can find
spokesman Kevin Beagley sporting a blue Hawaiian-style shirt, jeans and Nike
sneakers.
Friday is the one day of the week when staff at Network Systems'
headquarters are allowed to wear casual clothes to work. Jeans, slacks,
sweaters and brightly coloured shirts suddenly replace the drab conventional
garments of the business world.
Network Systems is just one example of a widespread trend among US
businesses towards more casual dress in the office, aimed at improving
employee morale and productivity.
According to Michael Losey, president of the Washington-based Society for
Human Resource Management, an association of personnel professionals: 'Being
able to dress casually in the office is a benefit for current employees and
a recruiting tool for new employees. It's a morale booster. It opens the
communication lines and brings senior management and the rest of the staff
together.'
Personnel managers argue that casual clothes can reduce stress and status
distinctions, helping create the right kind of atmosphere for a business to
succeed in the 1990s. Today's rapidly changing competitive environment means
workers down the line must be prepared to accept added power and
responsibility, and challenge those above them.
The trend began in California, as do so many American fashions. A decade or
two ago companies there began introducing one casual dressing day a week -
often called 'dress down Friday' - while seven-day-a-week informality has
always been the norm of the young, mould-breaking computer businesses of the
state's Silicon Valley.
'We don't have a dress code,' says Scott McNealy, chief executive of Sun
Microsystems, 'the only rule is that you must wear something.'
From California, the practice has gradually spread nationally.
A poll of 500 businesses conducted last year on behalf of jeans manufacturer
Levi Strauss - admittedly, hardly a neutral party - discovered 67 per cent
of companies allowed some casual dress: 14 per cent every day, 23 per cent
most days, 26 per cent one day a week and 24 per cent on special occasions.
Losey thinks the trend will continue: 'I don't think we'll see a large
number of organisations go to casual dress on a daily basis. But I do think
you'll see organisations offering either a weekly or bi-weekly casual day.'
A multitude of factors appear to lie behind the change, including: the entry
to positions of power of the 'baby boomer' generation, which tends to be
less formal than its parents; the much greater number of women in the
workforce, bringing with them more varied styles of work clothes; increasing
amounts of work being conducted from home or inflexible hours, which blurs
the distinction between office and leisure; and a trend for employees to
'work out' at the office, accustoming staff to the sight of casual sports
gear.
However, the practice still varies considerably by region, with casual dress
most common in the Rocky Mountains and least so in the northern midwest and
northeast, with their more conservative, sartorial traditions.
Yet even the most traditional companies are now unbending. Take AT&amp;T, for
example. The New Jersey telecommunications group, which 10 years ago was
known as an archetypal, buttoned-up, grey-flannel-suit outfit, now has an
informal 'dress down Friday' policy across the company.
It might be thought that adopting casual Fridays would make a company less
productive, on the grounds that employees wearing informal clothes would
subconsciously think the weekend had already begun.
However, many companies which have introduced such a scheme insist this does
not happen and in some cases productivity actually increases.
There are, however, limits to the trend. Employees working in areas where
they are in contact with the public, or where conservative clothes are the
norm, still tend to wear more formal garb. Examples include salespeople,
consultants and lawyers.
And companies impose restrictions on the degree of informality they will
permit.
At Network Systems, for example, shorts are frowned upon, though some other
companies permit them in summer, provided they are neither frayed nor too
short. Casual, in other words, does not mean sloppy or overly sexy.

FT  07 MAY 93 / RMT ballots members on BR peace plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RMT, the main rail union, yesterday started balloting its 60,000 members
on whether to accept a British Rail peace plan. The plan seeks to defuse a
dispute over redundancies and the use of contract labour which led to two
24-hour stoppages last month.
The RMT executive committee is recommending that its members reject BR's
proposals. The result of the ballot, to be completed later today, will be
known on May 14.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, the union's general secretary, said there was still 'a lack
of clear commitment and conviction in British Rail Board's statements'.
He added: 'If compulsory redundancy is not foreseen for the next couple of
years why will the board not guarantee it will not be used?'
He added that the union believed that BR could 'be forced to give the
protection for the future we are seeking' over the use of contract labour.
BR said yesterday that the message for the union was clear: 'Think before
you vote. More strikes will mean less security for railway jobs.'
BR has said it foresees no need for compulsory redundancies over the next
couple of years and also that there are 'no plans for a major extension' to
contract labour for track maintenance over the next couple of years.
Mr Arthur Scargill, leader of the NUM miners' union, said yesterday that his
union executive would wait for the outcome of the RMT ballot before deciding
whether to call a further 24-hour strike in protest at pit closures.
London busworkers are due to strike again on Monday in protest at cuts in
their pay and benefits. They have already held four one-day strikes.
Their union - the TGWU general workers' union - is organising a mass
petition in their support among the capital's travelling public.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Directors try to get CrossRail moving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING FIGURES from the private sector yesterday mounted a campaign to end
the delay on the Pounds 2bn CrossRail scheme, the biggest public transport
project planned for central London.
They called on the government to demonstrate its commitment to the scheme by
allowing the CrossRail bill, currently held up in parliament, to go forward
to a second reading before parliament recesses for the summer.
The CrossRail scheme involves building a pair of rail tunnels under central
London which would allow trains from east or west to run through the City
and West End.
It was postponed in March following a decision by the government that it
should only go ahead if it could be jointly funded by the private sector.
The campaign is being organised by London First, the private-sector group of
59 companies formed last October to lobby on behalf of the capital.
It has brought together by businesspeople such as Sir Allen Sheppard,
chairman and chief executive of Grand Metropolitan, Sir John Egan, chief
executive of BAA, Sir Colin Marshall, chairman and chief executive of
British Airways, and Mr Peter Foy, senior partner of McKinsey &amp; Company.
Mr Foy said there was a danger of deadlock because the government was not
prepared to take the bill forward without private-sector participation and
the private sector was not prepared to join in until the bill had been
passed.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Generator may halve cost of clean-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISHPOWER, the privatised Scottish electricity company, believes it can
nearly halve the projected cost of reducing emissions of sulphur dioxide, a
main cause of acid rain, from its coal-burning power station at Longannet on
the Firth of Forth.
It also said yesterday that it was to spend Pounds 24m on equipment which
would produce less nitrogen oxide and remove dust from flue gases at the
plant.
The company is soon to apply for planning permission to install flue-gas
desulphurisation (FGD) equipment at Longannet. It put the cost 'in excess of
Pounds 200m'. This compares with figures of between Pounds 350m and Pounds
400m quoted in its prospectus for flotation in 1991.
ScottishPower intends to use an FGD system called seawater scrubbing instead
of the more common system which uses gypsum to remove sulphur from flue
gases. Seawater scrubbing has not been used in Britain before, partly
because none of the plants where FGD is being installed are on the coast.
The company, which yesterday launched its new environmental policy, has to
meet standards on emissions set by the government in line with targets laid
down by the European Community. In 1990 the government decided that 8,000 MW
of UK generating capacity should be fitted with FGD equipment.
Yesterday Mr Mike Smith, ScottishPower's chief operating officer with
responsibility for environmental issues, said: 'We have pointed out to the
government on a number of occasions that it would achieve greater
environmental benefit if FGD was applied to more stations in England rather
than applied to us.' This is because ScottishPower's plants partly burn
Scottish coal, which has a lower sulphur content than other supplies.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Lloyds lags on small-business loans under LGS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WIDE discrepancies emerged yesterday in high street banks' lending to
companies under the government's small business loan guarantee scheme.
National Westminster Bank, the biggest lender over the past two years, put
Pounds 48.3m into the scheme, about double the amounts lent by Barclays and
Midland, two of its main rivals, and more than 10 times the Pounds 4.6m
committed by Lloyds.
NatWest accounted for 39 per cent of the Pounds 122.3m loaned in the period.
Under the scheme the government guarantees 70 per cent - soon to rise to 85
per cent - of a bank loan. It is intended to encourage the banks to lend to
viable businesses which have exhausted their own financial resources and
which cannot provide conventional security for loans.
The figures were released by Mr Edward Leigh, a trade and industry minister,
in response to a written question from Ms Anne Campbell, the Labour MP for
Cambridge.
They showed that NatWest and Midland granted far more loans than would be
strictly justified by their share of the small-business market while Lloyds
granted far less. NatWest accounts for 27 per cent of the small business
market, according to a recent survey by the Forum of Private Business.
Midland accounts for 12 per cent of the market but made 19 per cent of loans
under the guarantee scheme while Lloyds accounts for 17 per cent of the
market but made only 4 per cent of loans. Barclays accounts for 26 per cent
of the market and made 22 per cent of the loans.
The total amount loaned under the scheme fell from Pounds 70.1m in 1991-92
to Pounds 52.2m in 1992-93, most of this accounted for by a sharp drop in
NatWest's lending, from Pounds 34.6m to Pounds 13.7m. This was due to a
decline in the number of start-ups seeking loan finance and a tightening by
NatWest of its lending criteria.
Midland and Clydesdale were the only banks which lent substantially more
last year than in 1991-92.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced in March that the conditions of
the guarantee scheme were to be eased as part of a wide-ranging Budget
package to help small businesses.
Under the proposals the premium which is charged to small businesses is
being cut from 2.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent for variable-rate loans and 0.5
per cent for fixed-term loans.
Barclays said it expected that it would increase the amount of
guarantee-scheme lending once the government guarantee was increased. In the
past it has written off 40 per cent of the sums advanced under the scheme.

FT  07 MAY 93 / M0 slowdown shows fragility of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RATE of growth in money in circulation fell last month, underlining the
fragile nature of any upturn, according to figures from the Bank of England
released yesterday.
M0, the narrow measure of the money supply which mainly comprises notes and
coins in circulation, grew in the year to last month by a seasonally
adjusted 4.8 per cent, after year-on-year growth of 4.9 per cent in March.
This was the first fall in the year-on-year increase in M0 since December,
when this figure fell to 2.8 per cent from 3.0 per cent the previous month.
The figure for April is, however, much higher than the comparable numbers
for much of last year. It signifies a general buoyancy in retail spending
compared with early in the recession.
Mr Don Smith, an economist at Midland Global Markets, said the M0 figures
indicated consumer spending might be increasing at a slightly lower rate
than had previously been thought.
Separately, the Bank said that non-UK institutions bought Pounds 1.1bn worth
of gilts in March, the highest monthly figure since July 1987. Total gilt
sales were Pounds 2.7bn.
In February, foreigners bought Pounds 1bn worth of gilts. The figures for
overseas purchases in February and March augur reasonably well for the Bank,
which in the next year must sell large volumes of gilts to foreigners to
fund the large fiscal deficit for 1993-94, expected by the Treasury to reach
Pounds 50bn.
The longer leading index of economic indicators, which highlights
turning-points in economic activity about 11 months in advance, has
flattened in recent months, after rising strongly towards the end of last
year.
The Central Statistical Office said the rise in optimism recorded in the
April Confederation of British Industry quarterly industrial trends survey
had offset a fall in share prices.
The coincident index, which moves in line with the business cycle, has
resumed its rise following some hesitation last autumn. It shows
provisionally that the trough of the recession was in spring last year.
The office said the rise in the shorter leading index, indicating turning
points about four months in advance, reflected the results of the CBI survey
which showed higher reported new orders and expectations of less destocking.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Submission warns on dangers of
overload
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TEACHERS' submission attacks 'excessive prescription and content
overload'. It warns against the 'danger of an ad hoc, subject-by-subject
revision which would inevitably lead to a lack of coherence and possible
overload'.
The proposals follow three headings:
An overall view
The teachers say it is 'almost universally accepted' that the curriculum in
its present form takes up too much time to be balanced and broadly-based.
'Drastic pruning' of the requirements for each of the foundation subjects is
essential.
At each of its four key age ranges it should concentrate on 'the basics'.
General principles would include religious education, and 'the highest
priority must be given to reading, writing and basic computation' for
seven-year-olds.
Assessment
'Many technical flaws remain.' The teachers say this is because the
procedure 'suffers from attempting to combine too many features into one
system'. These include attempting to measure accurately each child's
attainment across an 'enormous range of attainment targets', while using the
tests in a diagnostic way 'although the timing of the tests and information
obtained from them are not appropriate for this purpose'. They say
assessment must 'support not dominate the curriculum', and take full account
of continuous assessment by teachers.
The review process
The teachers want a planned and predictable cycle, or 'shelf life' for
reviewing the content of each subject within the curriculum. This would curb
the secretary of state's current power to order revisions whenever it is
deemed appropriate.
Reviews of a subject would start two years before the end of its shelf life.
Evidence would be taken from inspectors' reports, teachers and other groups,
and proposals would be drafted by a group including teachers, inspectors,
and the Department for Education, before being presented to the secretary of
state. The proposals would then undergo two stages of statutory
consultation, before being finalised by the secretary of state.
The submission was jointly drafted by the six unions and endorsed by the
National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education, and five
organisations of independent schools: the Girls' Schools Association, the
Headmasters' Conference, the Incorporated Association of Preparatory
Schools, the Independent Schools Association Incorporated, and the Society
of Headmasters and Headmistresses in Independent Schools.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: US edging closer to Britain over
Ulster: Sir Patrick Mayhew's Washington visit has highlighted a policy shift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Northern Ireland secretaries made their annual visit to Washington in
the 1980s, they often faced scepticism and even downright hostility from
some members of Congress. Sir Patrick Mayhew this week received a much
warmer reception.
Congressman Frank McCloskey, an Indiana Democrat, described Wednesday's
meetings with Sir Patrick as 'very cordial'.
Mr McCloskey, chairman of the Friends of Ireland in Congress, said: 'I was
positively impressed.'
The spectrum of opinion within the US on Northern Ireland has narrowed
considerably. In the past the administration and the foreign affairs
establishment in Congress tended to back the UK, while some members of
Congress, mostly from New York and Massachusetts, were willing to overlook
some of the means adopted by the IRA out of sympathy for the ends of the
Irish nationalists.
President Bill Clinton's nominally more interventionist Northern Ireland
policy has been finessed since he took office into something much more
palatable to the UK government. At the same time many members of Congress
representing Irish-American constituencies are showing much less sympathy
for the IRA than in the past, and are far less critical of UK policies.
Both British and congressional officials credit the work of Mr Peter Brooke,
the former Northern Ireland secretary, in starting peace talks. They also
credit the 1989 Fair Employment Act, which went some way towards meeting US
criticisms of job discrimination against Catholics in Northern Ireland -
although some members such as Congressman Joseph Kennedy still have
reservations.
In addition, according to some congressional aides, the bomb that killed two
children in Warrington earlier this year has further diminished the sympathy
for the IRA.
The practical result is that little concrete action is likely to be taken in
the US this year on Northern Ireland.
President Clinton has toned his promise to send a peace envoy down to a
fact-finding mission, but the White House seems in no hurry to name its
leader.
At the same time the State Department has maintained its policy of refusing
a visa to Mr Gerry Adams - president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
IRA - as someone who has engaged in terrorism, even though Mr Clinton last
year said he favoured letting Mr Adams enter the US.
Neither issue was raised at Sir Patrick's meeting on Wednesday with
congressional leaders.
While legislation has been reintroduced offering sanctions against breaches
of the fair-employment principles of Mr Sean MacBride, the late Irish
statesman, congressional experts say it is unlikely to move forward.
Contributions to the multilateral International Fund for Ireland, however,
are likely to pass more smoothly. The Bush administration was unenthusiastic
about the fund, and the Senate was also eager to cut funding; pressure from
the House of Representatives, however, kept the money in the budget. This
year, a Dollars 20m contribution is included in the Clinton budget request.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour wrangle over VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNAL wrangling over economic policy left the Labour leadership
embarrassed yesterday as the government seized on an article by a party
spokesman suggesting the ending of VAT zero rating for all items.
Lord Desai, Labour economic spokesman in the House of Lords, also argued
that Labour 'should oppose spending cuts but be bold in proposing suitably
packaged tax increases'.
Senior party figures sought to play down the significance of the remarks but
the insistance of Mr Gordon Brown, Treasury spokesman, that Labour was
opposed to extending VAT to food, children's clothing, fuel and transport,
only highlighted tensions over the party's economic strategy.
To the annoyance of some Labour MPs the party opposes tax increases but also
complains about cuts in public spending. A revised tax and spending policy
will depend on the outcome of the independent commission on social justice
set up by Mr John Smith, party leader.
Lord Desai, writing in the left-wing Tribune newspaper, said: 'It is time to
debate whether Labour favours a high spending and high taxation policy,
balancing the budget over the cycle, or whether it is always for high
spending and low taxation.'
He added: 'The latter alternative, although attractive, is in the long run
neither economically rational nor politically credible.'
Lord Desai said Labour had to think about taxation that would hit
consumption by the better-off. He favoured higher band income tax and ending
of the ceiling on national insurance contributions, proposed in Labour's
1992 election manifesto.
'Failing that, I would remove zero rating for VAT on all items.' Benefit
entitlements could be doubled to compensate the poor, he added.
At Treasury questions, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, taunted Labour over
the Lord Desai article: 'I think the whole country and the House will
observe that the Labour party seems to have one policy in the House of
Commons and another policy in the House of Lords.'

FT  07 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Teachers' bodies scorn curriculum
review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL SIX teachers' unions have agreed on an alternative structure for the
national curriculum review which has been ordered by Mr John Patten, the
education secretary.
In an unprecedented show of unity by the teaching profession their nine-page
document has been endorsed by five representative bodies for independent
schools, including the Headmasters' Conference and the Girls' Schools
Association.
The move thwarts Mr Patten's attempt to appeal to 'moderate' teachers by
announcing a review of the national curriculum, as associations which refuse
to take industrial action have made clear their opposition to national
curriculum testing.
It comes at the end of a week when Mr Patten has been hit by the
resignations of two of the architects of the national curriculum, Lord
Skidelsky and Dr John Marenbon, from the School Examinations and Assessment
Council.
The teachers' plan would cut the proportion of the curriculum which is
prescribed by law, cut the amount of time devoted to testing and limit the
powers of future secretaries of state by providing a formal structure for
reviews at regular intervals.
Sir Ron Dearing, the chairman-designate of the new Schools Curriculum and
Assessment Authority, who is conducting the review, quickly welcomed the
teachers' proposals. He has already written to all six unions seeking
immediate meetings and hopes to meet them again at a later date. He also
thanked them for their prompt response but refused to comment on their more
detailed proposals.
The document attacks the tests, which two unions are boycotting. It says:
'The amount of time teachers are required to devote to assessment at the
expense of learning is far too great.'
Mr Brian Maybee, chairman of the Independent Schools Association
Incorporated, which endorsed the document, said the national curriculum in
primary schools was 'almost designed to limit the proper education of the
young child'.
He said Mr Patten's design for education had become 'too prescriptive, too
overloaded with assessment and simplistic testing'.
The National Union of Teachers, which is balloting its members on a boycott,
welcomed Sir Ron's prompt response and said: 'Hopefully he will listen to
the concerns of the profession and take them to heart. The needs of
individual children cannot be properly met by diktat from the centre.'
Mr Patten did not comment, saying that the teachers' unions would be
expected to provide Sir Ron with evi-dence.
Ms Ann Taylor, Labour's education spokesman, said that the tests should be
abandoned for this year, and that the membership of Sir Ron's School
Curriculum and Assessment Authority should be subject to ratification by the
Commons education committee.
She said: 'The sheer scale of opposition to Mr Patten and his brand of
testing is now so great that even he must by now have realised that
something has gone badly wrong.'
In a separate development, which further damages the chances of the tests
taking place, the National Association of Head Teachers advised its members
to permit their parents to withdraw children from the assessments.

swiftly
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BILL which gives legal backing to the government as a 'reinsurer of last
resort' in cases of terrorist attacks against industrial and commercial
property in Great Britain started its progress through the Commons yesterday
and will be published today.
Since the Baltic Exchange bombing in the City of London in April last year
the government has pledged to pay the difference in cases where the
insurance company cannot meet a legitimate claim in full.
The explosion at Bishopsgate last month prompted the government to speed the
bill through parliament.
The legislation has all-party support and is expected to go through all its
Commons stages next Thursday.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont upbeat on recovery prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN ANOTHER upbeat assessment of the outlook for the economy Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, told the Commons yesterday 'the prospects for
sustained recovery are good'.
He emphasised that inflation and the rate of increase in earnings were at
their lowest level for 25 years, while manufacturing productivity was
increasing sharply.
Mr Lamont acknowledged the need for 'firm control' over public expenditure
in responding to concern expressed by government backbenchers and opposition
MPs about the size of the public sector borrowing requirement.
Stressing the need to bring the PSBR down, he assured the House that it was
'a very high priority' for the government.
Ms Clare Short (Lab Birmingham Ladywood) accused him of 'pushing up' the
sterling exchange rate and warned it might result in the recovery being
lost. Mr Lamont retorted: 'The pound is floating and we have no
exchange-rate target'.
Further cuts in interest rates were urged by Mr Austin Mitchell (Lab Great
Grimsby), who said the government should stop trying to 'talk the pound up
again'.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Patten set to 'muddle through' on
tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST blows to the government's plans for testing have increased the
pressure on Mr John Patten, the education secretary, but left him still
determined to press ahead.
Although the courts have not proved a way of preventing the looming boycott
by teachers, and the traditional 'divide and rule' approach to the teachers'
unions has collapsed, Mr Patten and other ministers insist in public that
they want this year's tests to proceed.
In private, however, both ministers and officials recognise that there will
be disruption, and that the only question is its scale.
One said yesterday: 'The tests will be disrupted, that is now discounted.'
Another said: 'There won't be many league tables.'
Although the changes made to testing in Scotland as a result of pressure
from teachers and parents have been urged on ministers as a way of avoiding
the likely shambles, elsewhere in government there is little enthusiasm for
what has resulted there.
Ministerial determination not to change course has been bolstered by the
reaction to the advertising of leaflets about testing. The number of
responses asking for copies of the leaflets will be released in the next
couple of weeks, and a further 1.3 million copies will be issued with child
benefit.
One official said: 'It is now clear that the government is prepared to
muddle through. We are locked into our position.'
The government seems to believe the worst is behind it. The resignations of
two key advisers from the School Examinations and Assessment Council this
week are seen as a 'nuisance' rather than a more serious difficulty, and the
teachers' plans on the curriculum are seen as simply a matter for Sir Ron
Dearing's review.
Deep-rooted Tory dislike of the educational establishment has muted much
criticism of Mr Patten, although some ministerial colleagues have privately
expressed surprise that Mr Patten seems to have courted confrontation rather
than tried to avoid it.
Some Tory MPs are concerned about the resignation of Lord Skidelsky, and
others feel that Mr Patten has yet to show a clear enough commitment to the
simple and straightforward tests that backbenchers thought the government
had introduced in the education legislation.
The difficult balance to be struck by the education secretary was
highlighted by one MP yesterday. He said: 'If he really believes it is right
to have national but simple testing he will get plenty of support, but not
if he is rolled over by the educationalists.'

Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, told Mr Mitchell not

problems.
Underlining the importance of competitiveness, Mr Portillo said it was
'extremely encouraging' that while unit wage costs were falling in Britain
they were continuing to rise in Japan and Germany.
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's frontbench City spokesman, called on the
government to condemn the 'exorbitant' Pounds 10m a year reportedly received
by a Royal Bank of Scotland executive while others less well off were being
urged to take little or no increase in their pay.
While refusing to comment on individual salaries, Sir John Cope, the
paymaster general, insisted that ministers had set an example which he would
like to see followed by others in industry and commerce.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Voters set for council verdict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOTERS IN England and Wales went to the polls yesterday to elect a total of
3,501 councillors to 47 county councils.
In Newbury voters turned out in their thousands to deliver their verdict on
the government's record. Dry, sunny weather led to brisk early polling in
the parliamentary by-election and a high turn-out was expected.
Yesterday marked the broadest test of political support since the general
election in April last year, but preliminary indications were that turn-out
was low for the council elections in spite of the fine weather.
Politicians believed that the council tax failed to stimulate many voters
into turning out, even though it was the successor to the controversial
community charge, or poll tax.
There were no elections in Scotland, Greater London, or the metropolitan
districts, which elect their councillors in May next year.
For several councils they were also the last elections before abolition. The
eight counties in Wales will be converted into 21 all-purpose authorities.

FT  07 MAY 93 / TUC faces row over conference for blacks: Minorities want
the ability to set their own union agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRADES Union Congress faces an embarrassing public row tomorrow over
whether its annual black workers' conference should be restricted to
delegates from racial minorities.
Mr Marc Wadsworth, from the National Union of Journalists, said: 'The black
rank and file in the unions is on a collision course with the TUC
establishment, which has been manoeuvring all year to stop black-worker
self-organisation.'
The congress's race relations advisory committee - which has a black
majority - has recommended that the black workers' conference this weekend
should back a resolution from the National and Local Government Officers
Association (Nalgo) calling for the conference to admit whites only as
observers in future.
Mr Wadsworth said: 'We want to debate and formulate a black union agenda
among ourselves before going on to campaign for it in the broader movement.'
The congress carried out a consultation exercise recently to find out what
the unions think of such a restriction. Support for a conference restricted
to members of racial minorities has come from a handful of unions including
the public employees, the communication workers, the National Union of
Teachers and the RMT transport union.
Large unions, however, such as the TGWU and GMB general unions, the Ucatt
construction union, the shopworkers and the MSF technicians union, are
opposed to such an idea.
The transport workers, led by Mr Bill Morris, their general secretary, have
told the congress that the move would be 'divisive' and would create 'an
apparent segregation'. The union said this would antagonise many unions that
had not yet set up structures to encourage more black participation.
This year's TUC black workers' conference, which opens today, will for the
first time debate policy resolutions. It is expected to endorse a range of
proposals designed to improve the position of black workers in the labour
market, including:
A call for a statutory ethnic monitoring requirement for all employers, as
exists in Northern Ireland.
A statutory duty on all employers to pursue equality-of-opportunity policies
with goals and timetables for implementation.
Legislation to protect civil servants from ethnic discrimination in
market-testing programmes.
A call on the congress to oppose the recruitment and continued employment of
known racists in all industries where black people are clients of the
services provided. A demand that the congress accepts three black
representatives on its general council.
Union membership figures in a government labour-force survey show a sharp
fall in unionisation among black workers. The proportion has fallen to only
39.2 per cent among those with a Caribbean origin, compared with 49 per cent
at the end of 1991.
The number of whites in unions is less at only 34.2 per cent of all workers
(excluding the jobless and self-employed). Just 30.2 per cent of workers of
Indian origin and 23.5 per cent of Pakistani origin are unionised.
Forthcoming research based partly on the efforts of Mr Morris's union to
recruit cleaners at London's Heathrow airport reveals that the predominantly
Asian women workers saw the union 'as an unsympathetic white organisation'.
The research also shows that the local TGWU office had an all-white staff
and was located in an area mostly populated by racial minorities. The union
has since made efforts to improve the situation.
Dr John Wrench, at the Centre for Research in Ethnic Relations at Warwick
University, said: 'Barriers of isolation, language, low pay and anti-social
working hours make the task of recruiting black workers difficult for
unions.
'Although unions nationally are producing improved policies and literature,
translating such policies into action through local union offices is still
problematic.'

A GROUP of landlords has decided not to take action against Northern Rock
building society.
They were seeking to test the law on societies being required to discharge
the liabilities of their subsidiaries.
They claimed that Northern Rock should pay them rents owed following the
liquidation of a company to which it had sold 51 estate agency offices.
Mr Peter Hughes, a partner in Corbould Rigby &amp; Co, acting for two of the
landlords and co-ordinating investigations for a further 10, said yesterday
the group had been deterred by the likely cost of High Court action against
Northern Rock, the 11th largest building society.

But it would mean some people paying for treatment at rates agreed with

FT  07 MAY 93 / BCCI depositors win compensation ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEGAL device used by a group of BCCI depositors to increase many-fold the
compensation they received following the collapse of the bank was declared
legal yesterday by the Court of Appeal.
The scheme - used by a group of about 60 depositors - involved splitting the
money held on deposit into individual lots of Pounds 20,000 and then
formally transferring the ownership of these to trusted family members or
friends.
The depositors were able to claim Pounds 15,000 for each lot - the maximum
small investors' compensation for deposits of Pounds 20,000 or less - under
the Deposit Protection Scheme, which is designed to alleviate hardship when
a bank becomes insolvent.
The overall sum required to meet payments due to all BCCI depositors under
the protection scheme is about Pounds 78m. It is estimated that the
splitting device will cost the Deposit Protection Board about Pounds 3.7m.
By a two-to-one majority, Lord Justice Russell, sitting with Lord Justice
Simon Brown and Sir Michael Fox, dismissed appeals by the Deposit Protection
Board and Barclays Bank against a ruling by the Vice Chancellor Sir Donald
Nicholls in July last year upholding the scheme's legality.
The judges also refused the Deposit Protection Board and Barclays leave to
appeal to the House of Lords over the issue.
The scheme was devised by a firm of north London accountants, Pearlman,
Kahan and Joseph. It operated in July 1991 before the government blocked its
use by passing legislation.
Mr Keith Kahan, one of the firm's partners, said: 'We are delighted with the
ruling. About 60 original BCCI depositors split their money. Most of them
were small depositors who made assignments to their wives and children and
they will be the ones who benefit.'

FT  07 MAY 93 / City crime cut by armed road blocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARMED road blocks and other anti-terrorist measures undertaken by the City
of London police have contributed to a big reduction in crime in the Square
Mile, Mr Owen Kelly, commissioner, said yesterday.
He said that although the security measures failed to prevent last month's
Bishopsgate bombing they had generated a significant spin-off in other
areas.
Crime in the City fell by 10.6 per cent last year, he said. The reduction so
far this year was running at 16 per cent. The City is an unusually small
force and comparisons are difficult, but last year's reduction in crime was
the greatest in the country. Senior officers attribute it to high-profile
armed road blocks mounted in the City since last year and the presence of
more uniformed officers on the streets.
Mr Kelly, presenting the force's annual report, said he was very
disappointed that the Bishopsgate bombing had succeeded. However, he added
that no police force other than the Royal Ulster Constabulary had made
efforts as strong as the City's to prevent terrorism.
City officers are particularly anxious to stress their force's effectiveness
at present because Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, is examining the
future structure and organisation of the police service.
There is concern that the Bishopsgate bombing might provoke the government
into merging the City force with the much bigger Metropolitan Police in an
effort to demonstrate that it is taking steps to improve security in the
capital. The 800-strong City force was allowed to recruit an additional 36
officers after the Baltic Exchange bombing last year. A request for a
further, larger increase in resources has been made following last month's
Bishopsgate attack and Mr Kelly said he believed this would receive
sympathetic consideration.
The force's report shows a drop in the total amount of money obtained or
attempted to be obtained by fraud from Pounds 946m in 1991 to Pounds 514m
last year. It says Pounds 493m of the Pounds 514m was recovered or saved
from attempted fraud. These figures do not include the as-yet unassessed
losses from the BCCI, Maxwell and Wallace Smith Trust inquiries.
Police reports of racial incidents in south-east London more than tripled in
five years to reach 811 last year.
Mr Charles Wardle, home office minister, said in reply to a written question
from Mr Peter Bottomley, the Tory MP for Eltham, that the figures - covering
the boroughs of Southwark, Lewisham, Bromley, Greenwich and Bexley - also
show a doubling of incidents recorded between 1990 and 1992.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Ruling curbs cuts in pension scheme benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON Regional Transport could be forced to pay up to Pounds 93m into its
pension scheme following a High Court ruling on Tuesday unless it can reach
an agreement with members on improving benefits.
In a key ruling, Mr Justice Knox said that LRT could not alter the terms of
its pension scheme without taking account of benefits implied, but not
specifically promised. According to pensions experts the ruling places clear
limits for the first time on an employer's right to cut pension costs by
restructuring pension schemes.
The judge has directed all parties to the case - the trustees, the
pensioners, the active members and LRT - to reach a negotiated settlement.
Lawyers for the parties believe such a settlement may not require LRT to add
funds to the scheme directly, but it could be forced to set a minimum
contributions rate for itself, cut employees contributions and enhance
benefits out of existing surplus for present and deferred pensioners.
Mr Justice Knox ruled that where pension schemes are merged to create a new
scheme, not only must actual benefits to members not be substantially
worsened, but unwritten promises of benefits must be recognised. It is the
first time the courts have so unequivocally protected the expectations of
pension benefits.
There are some legal quirks in the case which are unique to the LRT pension
scheme, but many pensions experts believe the case will set a precedent. 'It
has widespread implications for members of ordinary occupational pension
schemes,' said Mr John Cunliffe, partner at McKenna and Co, who represented
the 45,000 present and deferred pensioners.
In 1989 two LRT schemes were merged into a new scheme via a statutory act of
parliament. The RMT rail union questioned, among other things, whether the
merger had been legally carried out, and whether it was right that LRT could
change the rules to eliminate the requirement that its own annual
contribution be 2 1/3 times that of the employees.
In the new scheme LRT contributions are determined by how much is needed to
pay the specified level of benefits.
The change in the LRT contribution rate meant that it could take a valuable
partial contributions holiday, reducing the Pounds 460m surplus by Pounds
93m.
Mr Justice Knox did not address the question of whether an employer is
entitled to use surplus. But he said that the existence of that surplus had
given rise to members' expectations that benefits would be enhanced, as
indeed they had in the years before the merger.
'No doubt the larger the surplus the livelier the expectation but in the
majority of cases it remains an expectation rather than a right. That is not
to say that it is either without value or that the law will not protect it
in appropriate circumstances,' Mr Justice Knox said.
Mr Edward Cooper, partner at solicitors Russell, Jones and Walker, which
represented the RMT union members, said that some ambiguities about the case
could affect its applicability to ordinary occupational schemes. Unlike most
mergers which are effected by trustees, this merger occurred through a
statutory act of parliament.
The Confederation of British Industry yesterday called on the government to
abandon its effort to force occupational pension schemes to increase
benefits in line with infla-tion.
Speaking at the annual conference of the National Association of Pension
Funds in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, yesterday, Mr Robbie Gilbert said the
new law would add considerably to company pension costs.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Virgin takes BA 'dirty tricks' war to court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIRGIN Atlantic Airways yesterday launched High Court proceedings against
British Airways following the failure of the two airlines to settle their
long-running 'dirty tricks' dispute.
Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's chairman, said the airlines were now 'at war'.
Virgin's writ against BA alleges copyright infringement, breach of
confidence and misuse of confidential information.
Speaking from Arizona, Mr Branson said Virgin had attempted for the past
four months to reach a compromise with BA. But he said the situation had
turned into a farce and it was now time for the courts to decide.
BA said it regretted that Virgin had discontinued settlement discussions.
'BA has made it clear that any liability which it may have will be met in
full', it added in a brief statement.
The High Court action relates to Virgin's allegations that its bigger UK
rival accessed Virgin passenger details and information as well as data
concerning aircraft and load factors relating to flights and associated
passenger and travel services.
Virgin said the proceedings were only the first of several other legal and
regulatory steps it proposed taking against BA in various jurisdictions
including the US and the European Community.
After BA agreed to pay Virgin Pounds 610,000 in libel damages and apologised
'unreservedly' in the High Court in January, Mr Branson warned he intended
to take further legal action if he did not secure adequate compensation for
the commercial damage he said Virgin suffered as a result of BA's 'dirty
tricks' campaign.
Involved negotiations between the airlines broke down on March 19 after
Virgin rejected a Pounds 9m cash compensation offer because of what Mr
Branson claimed was an un-acceptable 'vow of silence' demanded by BA.
Relations worsened following a television programme last week renewing
allegations that top BA directors were aware of their airline's campaign
against Virgin.
After the programme, Mr Branson challenged Sir Colin Marshall, BA's
chairman, and Mr Robert Ayling, the airline's managing director, to resign
or sue the television programme.
Sir Michael Angus, BA's deputy chairman, subsequently sent a brief note to
Mr Branson with a copy of a statement by the BA board to the airline's staff
giving its full backing to Sir Colin and Mr Ayling.
It said the board did not question the integrity of the two executives. 'The
view of directors is that any claims which Mr Branson thinks he may have
should be stated in the appropriate courts and be evaluated after full
consideration of all the evidence.'
Mr Branson said yesterday Virgin intended to subpoena Sir Colin, Mr Ayling,
and Mr Liam Strong, BA's former head of marketing and operations and now
chief executive of Sears, one of Britain's biggest high-street retailers, to
force them to give evidence in the High Court.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Hospitals raise only a third of target income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT programme to encourage hospitals to make money from activities
such as retail services has fallen far short of its financial targets, a
National Audit Office report shows today.
The income generation scheme was introduced in 1988 and the government hoped
it would raise Pounds 75m a year. According to the report, however, health
authorities and hospitals generated only Pounds 25m in 1991-92.
Even so, the National Audit Office believes income generation has
'significant potential' in the National Health Service and says that, in
principle, the Pounds 75m target should be attained.
It believes one reason for the failure to met targets so far has been due to
managers giving priority to introducing the 1991 health service reforms.
'However, these reforms will in themselves offer additional incentives for
units in future to exploit income generation where it would represent a
sensible use of their resources,' the report says.
An examination of three hospitals by the NAO and Touche Ross management
consultants concluded that they could raise additional net income of Pounds
298,000 in ways that would safeguard patients' interests.
The Department of Health has appointed its North Western regional health
authority to act as the lead region in promoting similar projects.
Authorities and hospitals have introduced a range of activities, from
leasing retail space and car park charges to offering occupational health
services to industry.
The report recognises that some hospital managers will not wish to share
expertise with potential competitors. But it says the NHS management
executive should promote networks of hospitals willing to share knowledge.

FT  07 MAY 93 / SIB urges graphic solution to life company presentation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S life insurance industry is being urged in a report by the
Securities and Investments Board to use graphics and illustrations to make
it easier for prospective purchasers of life insurance products to
understand them.
Mr Tim Miller, a SIB consultant and author of the report, believes the
graphs should show how many years it will take before a life or pensions
policy will give an entitlement to a 100 per cent refund of premiums if
cancelled early. They should also show the difference between the value of
the policy before and after charges are deducted and the value of life
insurance cover provided.
Other measures attack what some see as one of the great sales abuses in the
industry: the failure of so-called tied agents to tell customers that they
are only allowed to sell the products of one company.
Sales agents would be required to state clearly who they work for, what they
may sell and who pays them.
Instead of being allowed to use the title 'appointed representative', or
even 'adviser', a tied agent will only be allowed to call himself a sales
representative. He will have to show a 'status card' saying that he can only
sell the products of a particular company and which of that company's
products he is qualified to recommend.
Moreover, the sales agent will have to ask the customer to certify that he
has received all the information required and give a prescribed cancellation
form in case the customer changes his mind within the 14-day cooling-off
period.
But the centrepiece of the proposals is a chart which outlines at a glance
what the value of each policy is year-by-year until it matures. Consumers
will have to be given a prospectus outlining the product chosen and a chart
spelling out in numerical terms the information contained in the graph.
Mr Miller says that regulators have a responsibility to collect main
performance indicators on companies. These include some of the indicators
the industry is most unhappy about, disclosing such things as commission
payments to sales agents and fees and charges. 'I do not however suggest
that these returns should be assembled by the regulator into orders of
merit. That can be left to the press,' Mr Miller says.
Mr Miller last year resigned as a board member of Lautro, the
self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, because regulators at
Lautro and SIB had caved in to demands from the industry that they should
not be forced to disclose their own charges to prospective customers.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Touche Ross faces Fidelity trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RENEWED legal battle over the performance of Touche Ross as auditors to
Fidelity, an electronics company, is set to go to trial in October 1994,
more than 10 years after the company was acquired by Caparo, a privately
owned mini-conglomerate.
In the latest attempt to gain redress from the auditors, a case is being
brought by Intersound Consumer Electronics, the name by which Fidelity is
now known.
Caparo brought a case against the auditors and the directors of Fidelity in
1985. This culminated in a controversial ruling in the House of Lords in
1990.
The courts found against two directors, Mr Steven Dickman and Mr Robert
Dickman, who have since become bankrupt, but the action against Touche Ross
foundered.
A 1990 ruling widely welcomed by accountancy firms said auditors had no
'duty of care' to individual shareholders or other users of accounts, and
only to the company and to shareholders as a collective body.
The decision has led to calls for reform of the law, not least from Sir
Thomas Bingham, one of the appeal judges on the Caparo case, who led the
inquiry into the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
Now action is being brought against Touche Ross by Intersound, which is
owned by Caparo. The mini-conglomerate made a hostile bid for Fidelity which
led to its takeover of the company in October 1984.
A writ was first issued in March 1990 claiming damages and interest in
connection with breach of contract and/or negligence arising from the audit
of Fidelity's accounts for the period to March 31 1984.
The statement of claim quantifying the sums is not a public document. But
the original claim against Touche Ross by Caparo as shareholders was for
Pounds 13.4m for the acquisition, a further 20 per cent for the 'reasonable
return' on investment for that sum, less the residual value of the Fidelity
shares, plus interest.
The case centres on the alleged overstatement in the 1984 accounts of
stocks, sales and pre-tax profits.
Touche Ross has said it will defend the action 'forcibly'.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Business failures fall sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER EVIDENCE of a fall in business failures emerged yesterday with the
publication of figures showing that the number of receiverships and
administration orders dropped substantially last month.
Receivers or administrators were appointed at 255 companies in April
compared with 409 in March, according to the London and Edinburgh Gazettes,
the court publications, analysed by accountants Touche Ross.
The figure is the lowest since the 325 reported in December 1989 and
compares with 389 in April last year, providing further evidence that the
worst of the recession may be over.
Mr Christopher Morris, head of corporate special services at Touche Ross,
said he was optimistic that the trend would be maintained.
He said he was surprised at the decline, as conventional wisdom suggests
that the number of failures does not start to decline until about 18 months
after the the beginning of recovery.
The delay is explained in particular by the tendency for companies to
'over-trade' by taking new orders without sufficient cash to finance their
debts. Banks are also traditionally reluctant to grant new loans.
Mr Morris said the decline might reflect an unexpected healthiness in the
state of British business.
So far this year most regions have reported similar rates of receivership
and administration appointments to the levels in the same period last year.
Most property lenders do not believe that the insolvency profession provides
value for money, according to a survey by Chesterton, the chartered
surveyors.
Almost two thirds of the 60 financial institutions questioned said they had
not received good value from the insolvency industry.
Some lenders were also dissatisfied with the service provided by receivers
and administrators. Just over one in five respondents described the service
from insolvency practioners as poor, while 44 per cent described it as fair
and 30 per cent as good.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Howard set to face his critics: Carbon targets are attacked
as unrealistic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL How-ard, environment secretary, will open a government conference
today on how Britain should meet international targets to combat global
warming and will face accusations that government emission forecasts are
unrealistic and keep changing.
Mr Norman Lamont said in his Budget statement that Britain had put in place
measures to get two thirds of the way towards the target of stabilising
carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. According to
government forecasts the UK needs to cut emissions by 10m tonnes of carbon
(mtC) to a level of 160mtC.
Workshops organised by the Department of the Environment in preparation for
today's conference in London came to the conclusion that the 10mtC figure
was too low.
The main concern to come out of the workshops, which included industrialists
and environmentalists, was that emissions were forecast to rise steeply
after the end of the decade, largely due to rising traffic levels.
The workshops have also sent to Mr Howard their view that the voluntary
basis of present government schemes is inadequate.
Environmentalists are likely to question today why the Department of the
Environment has issued several conflicting sets of figures since the Budget
to explain how the 10mtC target will be met.
In evidence to the Commons environment committee on Wednesday the Department
of the Environment said the newly formed Energy Saving Trust and information
and education schemes would contribute savings of 2mtC to 3.5mtC this
decade.
This indicates a larger role for the trust, which is intended to encourage
households to save energy, than the department forecast soon after the
Budget, when it predicted a saving of 2.5mtC.
The department's estimate of the part played by new building regulations has
also fallen in the past two months, from 0.5mtC to 0.25mtC, according to its
evidence.
Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of
Energy, said: 'We had the initial commitment from the chancellor, reiterated
by the prime minister, and it now seems that they are juggling the figures
between different programmes to make them add up.'
The Department of the Environment said yesterday: 'The figures given on
Wednesday are our latest estimates.'
The trust's prominent role has sparked scepticism from environmentalists and
from the utility companies. It announced its first scheme this week after
taking more than a year to set itself up.

FT  07 MAY 93 / House valuations probed by MMC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORTGAGE lenders' practice of making their borrowers pay a fee for the
valuation of houses they intend to buy was yesterday referred to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission after complaints that borrowers are being
overcharged.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said he was referring
to the MMC the practice by which house buyers pay a total of more than
Pounds 100m a year so that mortgage lenders can ensure that they are lending
the appropriate amount.
The OFT has also received complaints from valuers and surveyors that some
lenders choose valuers because of the number of other borrowers they can
refer to the lender.
Sir Bryan said he was concerned that lenders have little incentive to keep
down the service's cost as it was passed on. He was also worried that
borrowers had little opportunity to 'shop around' to cut the cost.
The OFT said there had been 'a great many complaints' from bodies
representing valuers and surveyors that some mortgage lenders are
restricting the ability of some surveyors to compete in the market.
It said many lenders seemed increasingly unwilling to accept, for mortgage
valuation purposes, house surveys already carried out for a potential
borrower. It also said borrowers had been complaining about fee increases.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders welcomed the reference, which asks the MMC
to report by next February. It said that the process would 'clarify a
difficult subject and confirm that mortgage lenders' procedures are both
prudent and reasonable'.
Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the council, said that consumer interest
was not damaged by lenders restricting their list of valuers, and that care
was needed to avoid exploitation by fraudsters.
'Borrowers would be less well-served if lenders did not take stringent
precautions to ensure that mortgage valuations are carried out by competent
and reputable professionals,' Mr Boleat said.
The council said that most lenders 'carefully vetted' valuers. As long as
they meet criteria such as qualifications, the ability to introduce other
business 'may then become an additional consideration'.
The Incorporated Society of Valuers and Auctioneers said it had expressed
concern for some time about the cost of survey and valuations. It said there
were many reports of lenders rejecting valuations by independent valuers.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Insolvency profession found wanting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST PROPERTY lenders do not believe that the insolvency profession provides
value for money, a survey by Chesterton, a firm of chartered surveyors,
shows
Almost two thirds of the 60 financial institutions questioned said they had
not received good value.
Some lenders were also dissatisfied with the service provided by receivers
and administrators. Just over one in five respondents described the service
from insolvency practitioners as poor, while 44 per cent described it as
fair and 30 per cent as good.
Mr Mark Homan, president of the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency, said
in response to the findings that in some straightforward cases insolvency
practitioners might not bring a great deal of added value. Property
insolvencies often involved extremely complex situations, however, where
there was a clear need for expertise.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Christie's to auction Michelangelo drawing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTIE'S IN London is offering for sale on July 6 two exceptional master
works, both created in the early 1530s, and expected to set auction records
for an Old Master drawing and for a miniature.
The drawing, 'Rest on the flight into Egypt', is by Michelangelo and could
exceed the record Pounds 3.5m paid at Christie's in 1984 for Raphael's
'Study of a man's head and hand'. No paintings by Michelangelo are likely to
appear on the market and very few of his drawings remain in private hands.
Any rich museum, such as the Getty in Malibu, California, might regard this
as a last chance to acquire a work by one of the greatest of artists.
The drawing has an excellent provenance. It was apparently sold in the 1830s
for 250 guineas. It comes from a British family but the government is
unlikely to prevent it leaving the country.
The miniature is by Hans Holbein, a double portrait of the Tudor statesman
Thomas Cromwell in a single frame. In 1932 it sold at Christie's for Pounds
2,000. This time a price of about Pounds 500,000 is expected.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir in Cyprus: UK in no rush to step up pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIAL attempts to bring Mr Asil Nadir back to the UK to face trial failed
to advance yesterday as the attention of senior Foreign Office ministers
remained focused on Bosnia. At the same time, other government departments
said they were not involved in any new high-level initiatives to secure Mr
Nadir's return.
Mr Candemir Onhon, Turkey's ambassador to the UK, was summoned to the
Foreign Office, but Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, a Foreign Office minister, later
cancelled a meeting with him to answer a question in the House of Commons on
developments in Bosnia.
As a result, the moves to have Mr Nadir returned were put on hold, having
failed to make any headway the day before when the Turkish Cypriot
administration rebuffed an approach from the British High Commission in
Nicosia.
The Foreign Office said: 'Mr Garel-Jones will press for Turkey to apply
pressure for Mr Nadir's return.' No other steps would be considered until
the result of political pressure on Turkey became clear, it added.
The Serious Fraud Office was in direct contact with the Foreign Office
yesterday, and continued to maintain that Mr Nadir's September trial had
every chance of proceeding. Unofficially, however, other agencies in the
City remained doubtful that his return could be arranged from the
unrecognised break-away republic.
The Department of Trade and Industry, the ministry directly responsible for
the SFO's investigations and prosecutions, said it was not playing any part
in the attempts to secure Mr Nadir's return.
The Bank of England, which has emergency powers to apply financial sanctions
against northern Cyprus, said that it had not been involved in any
discussions with the Foreign Office, and did not expect the question of
sanctions to be raised, at least for some time.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir in Cyprus: Lost - a friend, a fortune and
political clout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KYRENIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS Mr Turgut Ozal, the former Turkish president, who prodded Mr Asil
Nadir to go the last time he flew to London, two years ago. On that
occasion, Mr Nadir was arrested at Heathrow airport.
With Mr Ozal's death on April 17, Mr Nadir may have lost his most powerful
friend and ally in Turkey. It must have been clear long before the latest
episode, though, that Mr Ozal was no longer prepared to back him as he had
in the past.
Mr Ozal's role in the Nadir saga is central to understanding the way Turkish
business works. During Polly Peck's liquidity crisis in 1990, there was
little enthusiasm for the 11th hour effort by the government in Ankara to
line up bridging finance. That operation was driven by President Ozal. The
bail money made available for Mr Nadir was also rustled up by Mr Ozal.
He had used investments by Mr Nadir to inject competition into Turkish
industry. He encouraged Mr Nadir invest in newspapers which lost huge sums
but provided a badly needed boost in the late 1980s to Mr Ozal's flagging
poll ratings.
But Mr Nadir's political connections and financial strength in the Eastern
Mediterranean are far weaker than they were three years ago, shortly before
Polly Peck International foundered. Even in northern Cyprus, where Nadir's
reputation among local inhabitants remains strong, there were signs
yesterday that the ruling administration was distancing itself from him.
Turkish officials said yesterday they were studying Mr Nadir's case.
Ankara's one concern is that Mr Nadir does not try to come to Turkey with
which, unlike northern Cyprus, the UK does have an extradition arrangement.
Like Turkish officialdom, the business community had since distanced itself
from Mr Nadir. 'He never had any real friends in Turkey, but what really
hurt was how quickly the few friends he did have disowned him,' says a
former employee. This sense of betrayal is likely to dominate his thoughts
as he plans his future.
If he was a powerful business figure in the area once, his empire is in
tatters. Moreover, with the sale of his Turkish newspaper titles he is no
longer able to influence opinion. Only in northern Cyprus, where his Kibris
daily sells around 10,000, does he have a vehicle.
Mr Nadir's fall from grace is unlikely to have much direct impact on the
Turkish economy. Turkish banks were always more wary of Mr Nadir than their
foreign counterparts. He felt and was always made to feel an outsider.
In a development that is particularly galling for Mr Nadir, many of his
former business rivals are now picking off his assets at prices well below
their book value, as the Polly Peck administrators attempt to wind up their
operation in the area.
The disposals of the Polly Peck businesses in Turkey, and attempts to seize
assets in northern Cyprus, have also eaten into Nadir's influence. According
to one former associate: 'The reason he had influence in the past was that
he had a lot of money. He doesn't have that any more.'
But one friend of Mr Nadir said: 'If there is one thing he was never short
of, it is charm. There's no way back as a businessman but as a politician,
well who knows?'

FT  07 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir in Cyprus: Bankruptcy vice was tightening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ASIL NADIR was running out of time to comply with various English court
orders brought to force him to co-operate with his trustee in bankruptcy, it
has emerged.
Mr Neil Cooper, a partner with accountants Robson Rhodes and the
court-appointed trustee, said yesterday that he had requested court orders
to force Mr Nadir to provide him with greater information.
The action followed a failure by Mr Nadir to co-operate fully in Mr Cooper's
attempts to identify the ownership of numerous assets and to trace a series
of transactions.
If Mr Nadir had not complied with the orders shortly, he would have faced
action for contempt of court, including possible imprisonment.
Mr Cooper said that he was unable to put a value on assets to which Mr Nadir
might lay claim, because of questions over both ownership and valuation.
He warned: 'There are quite likely to be assets in parts of the world that
Mr Nadir can effectively control and we cannot.'
He said potential assets to which there are claims by members of Mr Nadir's
family included several casinos, newspapers, banking investments, an island
and a floating house in Turkey.
Mr Cooper said he was taking legal advice about possible court action in
Turkey in an attempt to take control of assets.
He added that the ownership of three houses in northern Cyprus reportedly
owned by Mr Nadir remained in dispute.
There are also numerous antiques, artefacts and oil paintings which have not
yet been tracked down by the trustee in bankruptcy.
Meanwhile, administrators to Polly Peck at accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand
said that before Mr Nadir's escape they had been 'getting near' to sales of
numerous assets in northern Cyprus. These included several hotels and other
companies.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir in Cyprus: SFO admits it was warned of plans to
escape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SERIOUS Fraud Office admitted yesterday that it was tipped off about Mr
Asil Nadir's plans to flee the UK two days before he jumped bail and left
for northern Cyprus.
But although police issued a standard warning to all major ports and
airports, no individual surveillance operation was mounted on Mr Nadir or
his Belgravia home.
Mr Nadir was therefore still able to slip out of the country in a chartered
private jet aircraft.
The decision not to mount a surveillance operation on Mr Nadir followed a
series of previous tip-offs that he might flee the country - all of which
had proved false.
It is understood that on at least two previous occasions following such
warnings, police mounted extensive surveillance operations on Mr Nadir and
his Eaton Square home where, as a condition of bail, he was required to
spend his nights.
In a highly unusual move to pre-empt possible criticism, the SFO yesterday
issued a statement saying that following the last tip-off, the police had
taken 'action appropriate to the circumstances'. It continued: 'Throughout
the SFO investigation, information has been received on a number of
occasions from a variety of sources suggesting that Mr Nadir might
imminently abscond. All such information was followed up by the police and
Nadir continued to comply with his bail conditions.'
The anonymous tip came in the early hours of last Sunday morning from a man
claiming to act on behalf of Mr Ramadan Guney, the Turkish businessman who
put up a Pounds 1m surety for Mr Nadir's bail - a sum he now stands to
loose.
The SFO was yesterday given permission by an Old Bailey judge to issue a
warrant for the re-arrest of Mr Nadir. During a short hearing, Detective
Superintendent James Davis of the Metropolitan Police said Mr Nadir had
reported to Savile Row police station on Monday evening according to his
bail conditions.
That evening was the last sighting of the Polly Peck chairman and the
warrant will remain unenforceable unless Mr Nadir returns to Britain or is
arrested in a country which has an extradition treaty with the UK. The SFO's
main hope of bringing Mr Nadir to trial rests on informal diplomatic
pressures on Turkey and northern Cyprus.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir in Cyprus: Only the timing of flight was a
surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURKISH Cypriot business-men in London yesterday said that although they had
been surprised by the timing of Mr Asil Nadir's flight, it had been widely
expected that he would leave the UK. 'It doesn't need a brain to see that he
would go - who wants to go to prison?' said one shopkeeper, who refused to
be identified, as he stood in his shop in Dalston, east London - a centre of
the 100,000 strong Turkish Cypriot community in England.
Mr Ahmet Karadogan, a leader of the Turkish Cypriot research group and
organiser of the Turkish business forum said: 'The timing of this was
surprising. But what was more surprising was that he didn't go earlier.' He
added: 'The Turkish Cypriots feel there has been a very great injustice in
the way the issue was dealt with and the length of time it took to come to
court.'
In shops and the cafes of Dalston, there was a widespread belief that the
failure of the police to monitor Mr Nadir suggested he had received some
connivance from the authorities. One community leader said: 'In Turkey we
have a saying: 'Before you steal a minaret you must arrange a place to hide
it - this was all planned before.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations said last night it felt encouraged to proceed with
preparations for a 'free and fair' election in Cambodia later this month,
despite continued attempts at disruption by the Khmer Rouge.
Mr Yashushi Akashi, head of the UN peacekeeping force in Cambodia, said
after meeting Cambodian faction heads in Beijing he had been 'given
encouragement' to proceed with elections planned for May 23-27. However, he
conceded that Khmer Rouge absence from the process coupled with threats to
disrupt the election was 'not a very happy omen'.
Earlier, Mr Son Sann, the leader of a moderate Cambodian splinter faction,
had urged the United Nations to postpone elections in the strife-torn
country to allow further reconciliation efforts.
Mr Son Sann's call was debated at a meeting convened at Prince Norodom
Sihanouk's villa in Beijing and attended by representatives of three of
Cambodia's four factions. The Khmer Rouge, responsible for the deaths of an
estimated 1m Cambodians during their 1975-79 rule, stayed away.
Mr Akashi, head of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia, strongly
recommended that elections proceed as planned. 'No Cambodian party should
have a veto on peace or the electoral process,' he said.
AP adds from Phnom Penh: Gunmen believed to be Khmer Rouge guerrillas
attacked a train, killing at least 13 people and injuring dozens more, a UN
spokesman said. The 50 guerrillas blew up a section of railway track in the
north-western province of Battambang and then opened fire on the carriages.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Washington on defensive over loans for Vietnam: Hanoi is
looking for money, while the US is looking for policies reports Victor
Mallet from the ADB meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT FOR the first time at an international forum, the US was on the
defensive at this week's annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank in
Manila.
Its isolation was particularly marked over its continuing refusal to
countenance ADB loans for Vietnam because of a US economic embargo dating
back to Hanoi's Vietnam war victory in 1975.
Japan, Germany, France and Asian countries all pressed Vietnam's case at the
ADB, as they have at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But
the Clinton administration, fearful of lobbyists at home who claim Vietnam
has hidden or killed US prisoners of war, has deferred a decision on
renewing multilateral aid until the next IMF board meeting in June.
The US has only 13 per cent of the voting power in the ADB, but the bank
likes to ensure consensus before taking any decisions.
Iran's application for membership is being blocked by the US and some of its
allies, but Vietnam is already a member and is just unable to borrow. 'We
think that we should be treated equally with other member countries,' Mr Cao
Sy Kiem, the head of the Vietnamese delegation, told the meeting.
ADB staff are itching to start lending to Vietnam and have already visited
the country numerous times to prepare 10 projects which will focus on
much-needed improvements to Vietnam's infrastructure, including electricity
transmission, water supplies and Saigon port. The ADB expects to extend more
than Dollars 200m (Pounds 130m) a year in soft loans to Vietnam as soon as
Washington gives the green light. 'We have prepared everything for Vietnam
for the last two or three years,' said one ADB official. 'We have been
waiting at the starting line, but no gun is fired.'
The US was given only a marginally more sympathetic hearing at the ADB this
week when it called for the bank to restrain its urge to lend more and more
each year and reaffirmed its reluctance to accept a proposed doubling of the
bank's Dollars 23bn capital.
Developing Asian countries and Japan, the other main shareholder along with
the US, boasted that in 1992 the ADB had lent a record Dollars 5bn in
ordinary and soft credits. Several western nations, however, echoed the US
calls for thrift and a greater emphasis on the quality rather than the
quantity of projects.
The planned capital increase and the 'sustainable level of lending' (SLL)
concept - a pet phrase of US representatives to multilateral institutions
these days - proved to be controversial even among the US and its allies.
The basic idea of SLL is simple enough: development banks should reach a
point where they can fund new lending from their own profits and from the
incoming repayment of previous loans instead of expanding for ever with
repeated injections of cash from the US and other donors. The arguments
arise when it comes to deciding what annual level of loans is desirable in
the long term.
If SLL was applied now, ADB officials say, the bank would have to restrict
its annual lending from ordinary resources to about Dollars 3.4bn, or below
the present level of around Dollars 4bn, whereas the bank's managers intend
to increase lending by more than 10 per cent a year to Dollars 7bn or
Dollars 8bn by 1998 to meet growing demand for finance from China, India and
others.
'We could be bonsai-ed, like a plant in a pot that never gets bigger,' says
one senior ADB official.
Many bank officials believe the US proposal of SLL is linked to its
reluctance to subscribe to the capital increase.
One way to avoid a capital increase, the US says, is to reinterpret the ADB
charter so that it is the total loan disbursements - rather than loan
commitments - which must not exceed capital and reserves of about Dollars
27bn. Loan commitments are close to the limit but disbursements lag behind
and there is more than Dollars 11bn of undisbursed ADB loans.
ADB officials say that if the charter is reinterpreted, as Washington
wishes, to remove the limit on commitments, then SLL or some other safeguard
is obviously needed to prevent the bank from making loan promises it cannot
keep. 'SLL is only relevant if you have a new charter interpretation - to
stop you making more commitments than you can find when you disburse,' says
Mr Gunther Schulz, ADB vice-president for finance and administration.
Several countries, including France, expressed reservations about SLL and
said regular replenishments of the bank's resources were important because
they allowed shareholding nations to review and discuss the ADB's
objectives.
The US was further weakened in its isolated stand at the ADB by the sense of
uncertainty among US representatives about the Clinton administration's as
yet unformed policy towards multilateral institutions, by the relatively
junior level of its delegation, and by the fact that the US is in arrears on
its existing commitments to the ADB and its soft loan arm, the Asian
Development Fund.
Most Asian delegates left Manila with the impression that the Americans,
whether discussing Vietnam or the proposed capital increase, were playing
for time until they can decide what policies to adopt.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Algeria reforms run out of steam: State of emergency has
retarded economy programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALI Kafi, the Algerian head of state, is due to address the nation
tomorrow to outline a strategy for coming out of a 15-month state of
emergency. But as political pressures, fuelled by Islamic fundamentalism,
show no signs of abating, the economic reform programme is losing momentum.
Mr Belaid Abdessalam, when appointed prime minister last July in the wake of
the murder of Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, Mr Kafi's predecessor, decreed a 'war
economy', a campaign to clear up corruption and stamp out the black market.
He also promised ordinary Algerians their standard of living would not
suffer from economic reforms.
Many Algerians, however, were mindful of Mr Abdessalam's past. He was
Algeria's economic overlord from 1965 to 1978 when a policy of massive
industrialisation was launched and tight state control imposed on foreign
trade. They share the view of many foreign observers that their country has,
ever since, been paying a heavy price for this attempt to turn Algeria into
'the Japan of Africa by the year 2000'.
The prime minister has so far been unable to deliver. There has been no
campaign against corruption, the black market flourishes, and wages in the
state sector were frozen last winter. Loosening the noose of Algeria's
Dollars 26bn (Pounds 16.8bn) foreign debt, the servicing of which still
absorbs three quarters of export earnings, has proved impossible.
The prime minister has reinstated government control on imports of all
foreign goods worth more than Dollars 100,000 and refused to allow the
dinar, which lost half its real value between 1989 and 1991, to continue
depreciating. These two decisions have prevented any new agreement with the
International Monetary Fund.
The one-year standby agreement reached with the IMF in June 1991 was in
effect scuppered when that December the then prime minister, Mr Sid Ahmed
Ghozali, granted a 40 per cent wage increase to workers in the state sector
in an attempt to buy the elections. The attempt failed and the now banned
Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) went on to win elections which were
subsequently annulled.
The government has stuck to one key element of the reforms, the freeing of
all prices, bar those of basic foodstuffs such as flour and dairy products.
But it says it is putting off other measures because it is unwilling to risk
unleashing a social explosion at a time when it is engaged in an ever
bloodier confrontation with radical Moslem groups.
Under the new import system a committee of senior officials chaired by the
minister of commerce must pronounce on roughly 1,000 import requests at its
weekly Sunday meetings. One senior minister confesses that 'the system is a
nightmare and quite unmanageable'.
It also favours the large state corporations whose mismanagement and
overstaffing are at the root of Algeria's economic woes and corrupt ways. It
does nothing to rationalise the state sector as it allows entities which are
de facto bankrupt access to the same foreign credit facilities as others
whose health is far better. It also crowds out well-run private companies.
The prime minister then suspended some articles of the Law on Credit and
Money which in April 1990 had opened Algeria to foreign investment by
granting the same conditions for all investors, be they domestic or foreign,
state or private.
By December 1991, 131 foreign companies had signed joint ventures to produce
or distribute goods in Algeria, with planned investments of Dollars 2bn.
Names such as Peugeot, Fiat, Daewoo, Pfizer and Rhone-Poulenc bear witness
to the fact that many large western companies were interested in investing
in Algeria.
Another cause for concern is the budget deficit, which is set to double this
year, reaching 14.2 per cent of gross domestic product. In 1991 the budget
surplus amounted to 2.4 per cent of GDP. This mushrooming deficit is the
result of the wage increases granted 18 months ago and of the growth in
credit to state enterprises. Inflation is an estimated 30 per cent a year.
Pressure on Algeria's external finances meanwhile remain considerable,
despite the recent granting of a Dollars 900m package of Japanese Exim Bank
loans to finance developments in the energy sector, the only one which is
attracting a steady flow of foreign investment.
Lack of agreement with the IMF has led Algeria into an impasse. Failure to
pursue economic reforms is explained in government circles by the priority
given to fighting 'terrorism'. Yet the real economy continues to decline.
The prime minister is the only man with the ability to break the impasse.
Many Algerians doubt however that Mr Abdessalam really believes in the
reforms.

<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S angry white farmers yesterday took a leaf from the manual of
the black liberation movements and staged a Boer version of mass action in
the ultra-conservative town of Potchefstroom in the western Transvaal.
About 3,000 farmers, clad in khaki shorts with a revolver in the waistband,
shouted 'shoot them, shoot them' and threatened war against blacks if white
farmers are killed. At least six farmers or their wives have been killed
since the April 10 assassination of Mr Chris Hani, the Communist party
leader, unleashed a wave of black outrage.
Bluster and belligerence were the order of the day. But plans for the war
failed to get off the ground: the man who was supposed to lead it - retired
General Constand Viljoen, one of a group of former police and army generals
who have recently threatened to form a 'white army' to fight political
reform - was in remarkably tame mood.
He pleaded with farmers to treat their black workers well so they would
remain loyal on the day of the revolution, and urged Afrikaners to unite.
With the right wing split into some 200-odd fringe groups, unity is likely
to remain elusive.
Gen Viljoen, one of the five-man group calling itself the Committee of
Generals, says his aim is to form a united Boer front to exert pressure on
South Africa's constitutional negotiators - before it is too late.
As constitutional talks near a climax, and the African National Congress and
the government vow to reach a constitutional deal within weeks, right-wing
politicians know this is their last chance to push for the autonomous
Afrikaner state which is their central goal.
They say they will stage mass protests, strikes and boycotts - the familiar
tools of black resistance - to persuade the negotiators they are serious.
And if that fails, war.
But 3,000 farmers do not make an army, and the top brass of both police and
army are believed to back reform.
The right might remember that when 1,000 white farmers tried to break up a
National party political meeting in the western Transvaal town of
Ventersdorp two years ago, white police fired on them, leaving three dead.
With Mr Peter Mokaba, ANC Youth League leader, popularising the chant 'kill
the Boer', farmers have clear cause for concern. Booklets on sale at the
gathering, including one entitled Provisions for Crisis: survival in the new
South Africa, offer advice on how to prepare for the revolution by laying in
stores of tinned food and emergency water supplies. Another gives tips on
'armed protest'.
'Don't look for a bloodbath,' one speaker warned. 'Or you'll get it and
we'll win it.' But as Gen Viljoen pointed out, the government entered
negotiations precisely because it could not win a war against the ANC. It is
difficult to believe that whites will try that tactic again soon.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIVISIONS in Israel over the pace and direction of the Middle East peace
talks in Washington intensified yesterday, with an opinion poll revealing
that 59 per cent of those questioned opposed any territorial concessions to
the Arabs.
The Gallup poll, published by the newspaper Ma'ariv, is a blow for Mr
Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, who already this week has argued publicly
with Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, over the peace process and faces
renewed problems with the unity of his coalition government.
Some 59 per cent of those Israelis questioned said they were against
territorial concessions to the Arabs, even if Israel maintained control over
some land along its pre-1967 borders and east Jerusalem. Mr Peres earlier
this week said he favoured an eventual federation between the West Bank,
Gaza and Jordan, a suggestion promptly rejected by Mr Rabin.
The prime minister has asked cabinet colleagues to stop public discussion of
the peace process, but two ministers said on Wednesday they believed it was
time to give a decisive push to the negotiations. Mr Arye Deri, the minister
of the interior, immediately warned that such comments gave the impression
Israel was conducting a clearance sale in the occupied territories.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Japan current account surplus record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S current account surplus rose by 38 per cent to a record Dollars
19.09bn (Pounds 12.3bn) in March compared with the year before. The
government figures, published yesterday, are likely to fuel US pressure for
measures to cut the surplus.
The sharp rise in the surplus largely reflects the recent appreciation of
the yen against the dollar, which has increased the dollar value of Japanese
exports.
The yen's strength will ensure that the dollar value of the trade surplus
will continue to rise strongly for the next few months just as the US and
Japan conduct talks on measures to open the Japanese market to imports. The
talks are aimed at reaching an agreement on trade policy which President
Bill Clinton and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, would finalise
at a summit in early July.
The growth in the surplus will also add to pressure on Japan to consider
further measures to boost domestic demand, to suck in more imports. The US
administration has repeatedly said it regards the special Y24,000bn (Pounds
141bn) pump-priming measures which Tokyo has introduced since last August as
just a first step in reviving domestic demand in Japan.
In March the trade surplus was 20.2 per cent higher at Dollars 15.6bn than a
year earlier, as the dollar value of imports rose 10.1 per cent to Dollars
18.24bn and exports increased 14.5 per cent to Dollars 33.83bn. However, in
yen terms Japanese exports were only 1 per cent up in March at Y3,960bn,
while imports were 2.9 per cent down at Y2,135bn.
For the year to March Japan's current account surplus was 39.7 per cent up
at a historic high of Dollars 126.08bn. The previous record was Dollars
94.14bn in 1986. The trade surplus for the 1993 fiscal year was Dollars
136bn, up 19.7 per cent.
Combined with the slowdown in the Japanese economy, the surge in the surplus
is likely this year to take it close to 4 per cent of gross national
product, the peak it reached in the mid-1980s which led to trade friction
with the US.
The downturn in Japan was confirmed by an 11 per cent fall in vehicle sales
in April from the same month in 1992. The slump douses hopes that a 1.7 per
cent increase in March's sales marked the bottom of the decline in the car
market.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Slow start on bad debts: Japanese banking body buys up few
loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE banking body set up to clear the mounting pile of problem
loans, the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, bought only one loan last
month, raising doubts about its ability to restore public confidence in
banks and the property market.
In the weeks before the fiscal year ended in March, banks pumped Y681.7bn
(Pounds 4bn) in bad loans into the CPCC, which bought them at a generous 66
per cent of face value, enabling the banks to get the loans off their books
and write off a relatively small loss.
But in April, the CCPC bought only one Y100m non-performing loan from a
second-tier regional bank, suggesting its main purpose was to enable banks
to get their books in order for the close of the financial year. The CCPC
bought the loan for Y80m, allowing the unidentified bank to record a loss of
Y20m.
Officially, the leading 21 banks had Y12,300bn in property-related problem
loans in September and an estimated Y13,500bn at the end of March. However,
that figure does not count affiliates' problem loans or those on which
interest rates are cut to almost zero to support a collapsing company - a
generally accepted unofficial estimate is Y30,000bn.
Japanese banks' problems arise from their lending to property developers and
their acceptance of overvalued property as collateral during the late 1980s.
Increasing fears of a bank collapse prompted the industry to establish the
CCPC, which values the property and other collateral and buys the loan
credit.
Under the CCPC's guidelines, banks wanting to sell loan credits have to
provide the company with the necessary funds, and they remain responsible
for selling the property, even though they have theoretically sold the
collateral to the company. The real effect of the transaction is to allow
the banks to take a write-off for tax purposes.
It was also hoped that the company would help to put a floor under property
prices through its valuations, but in the first three months of operation
the CCPC has recovered only Y410m of the Y452.1bn in loan credits purchased.
Only two properties held as collateral have been sold.
CCPC officials yesterday said the rate of purchases should increase in
coming months, and 100 loans were under review, but the slow pace of debt
collection and banks' waning interest in the body have limited its
effectiveness.
A recovery in Tokyo stock prices and indications of increasing demand for
some residential property have encouraged banks to resume property-related
lending, which rose 6.3 per cent in February, compared to a year earlier,
the Bank of Japan said yesterday.
Japan's Finance Ministry has an informal rule that a warning should be
issued to banks when property lending growth is more than 3 per higher than
overall lending growth for two months, as was the case in January and
February. But the ministry said 'there does not seem to be a need to issue
warnings' at present.
It is expected the leading banks will announce individual problem loan
totals this month, showing that, officially, these range from 9 per cent of
outstanding loans at one trust bank to under 2 per cent at the strongest
commercial bank.
Mr Paul Heaton of Smith New Court Japan said the official ratios would be
far lower than the real burden, and the slow pace of loan purchasing at the
CCPC suggested the banks would 'take a very long time' to shed bad loans.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Low turnout for funeral of Sri Lankan President

<TEXT>
The daughter of assassinated Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa cries
over his coffin, moments before it was taken on a procession through Colombo
for cremation yesterday. The funeral ceremony, of great calm and dignity,
was attended by far smaller crowds than the organisers had expected, writes
Stefan Wagstyl in Colombo.
The low turnout disappointed the ruling United National Party which had
hoped the funeral would prove a show of political strength. The mourners
numbered fewer than 10,000 compared with 100,000-plus who attended the
funeral last week of a murdered opposition party leader, Mr Lalith
Athulathmudali. UNP officials blamed the turnout on a curfew which forced
thousands of mourners to start their journeys home before the funeral
started.
Police and army units were deployed throughout the city to prevent possible
unrest. There were fears that the majority Sinhalese community might seek to
attack members of the Tamil minority. The Tamil Tigers, a Tamil insurgency
group, is widely blamed for the president's death.

FT  07 MAY 93 / World Trade News: US reviews Canada lumber ruling
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US-CANADA trade panel has ordered the US Commerce Department to re-examine
its decision of a year ago that Canada was unfairly subsidising softwood
lumber exports. It has 90 days to report back to the panel.
Washington imposed a 6.5 per cent duty on US imports of lumber from four
provinces, among them British Columbia, after the Commerce Department ruled
that Canadian timber practices included unfair subsidies, mainly in the form
of low tree-cutting fees in provincially owned forests.
The panel's decision has been eagerly awaited by the Canadian lumber
industry, US homebuilders and environmentalists. The lumber producers and
their US customers claim that the higher duties have cost them about Dollars
200m and pushed up US house prices. Canada exported 13bn board feet of
softwood lumber valued at Dollars 4.2bn to the US last year, equal to about
29 per cent of the US market.
The environmental movement on the other hand, has strongly criticised low
stumpage rates as an encouragement to cut down trees. It is pressing for a
tighter system of natural resource accounting as part of the North American
Free Trade Agreement under negotiation.
An official of the Washington-based Natural Resources Defence Council
expressed satisfaction that 'as long as the duty remains in place, there
remains some leverage to change some of the forestry practices in Canada'.
The panel, consisting of five members from both countries, said the Commerce
Department should have considered whether the stumpage fees had a distorting
effect on normal competitive markets before concluding that they constituted
a countervailable subsidy. However, it agreed with some aspects of the
department's finding.
The bi-national panels, which are set up under the 1989 free trade
agreement, have helped the Canadian government defuse political criticism of
perceived trade harassment by Washington.
Another national panel is examining whether the US International Trade
Commission's methods were flawed in finding the duties harmed US industry.

<TEXT>
PLANS to create Mercosur, a common market of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and
Uruguay, by 1995 will now be delayed, according to Mr Guido Di Tella,
Argentine foreign minister.
He said in an interview that economic difficulties in Brazil, and its
insistence on greater import protection of sensitive industrial products,
will delay the full introduction of a common external tariff for imports
into the region.
Mr Di Tella said: 'I do not think we will reach 100 per cent of the common
external tariff, but our estimation is that 80 per cent of products by value
will be covered. On 20 per cent of goods, such as computers and capital
equipment, we will have to accept these being exempted from the tariff, so
we will have 80 per cent of a common market. We never thought we would reach
100 per cent.'
Brazil would have higher tariffs on such goods for five to seven years.
Argentina would not alter its lower tariffs, which would give it a
competitive advantage, he said.

FT  07 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Greece drags its feet on public utilities
sell-off - There is opposition even within the cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GREEK government's decision last month to call off negotiations for a
600MW gas-fired power station at Lavrion near Athens, to be constructed
using the build-operate-transfer (BOT) form of private financing, will have
disappointed the two international consortia shortlisted for the Dollars
500m project. But it will hardly have come as a surprise.
The ruling conservatives' privatisation programme is being challenged as
fiercely by cabinet members in prime minister Constantine Mitsotakis's
government as it is by the trade unions and the socialist opposition.
Moreover, the state-owned Public Power Corporation (Deh), the potential
customer for power from the Lavrion plant, appears reluctant to give up its
monopoly of electricity production with the introduction of BOT. Under a BOT
contract, an infrastructure project is built and operated by a private
concern which pockets the profits for an agreed period before transferring
it to government ownership.
International companies bidding for public procurement contracts in Greece
are resigned to enduring bureaucratic delays. But Deh's unwillingness to
start co-operating with a private partner was underlined by what, even by
local standards, seemed excessive foot-dragging.
It took two years for the Lavrion project, the first of four thermal plants
planned under the BOT system, to reach the stage of shortlisting bidders.
The start of contract negotiations with Tractebel of Belgium, which heads
one of the two shortlisted international consortia (the other was headed by
Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss engineering group) was postponed for
three months after it emerged, by a narrow margin, as the low bidder.
By contrast, the government is only a few weeks behind schedule in a more
complex project, the sale of a 35 per cent stake in OTE, the state telecoms
group, to an international telecoms operator, together with a stock market
flotation of another 14 per cent of the company.
However, the economy ministry, prevented from financing large infrastructure
projects by the size of the public sector deficit, remains an enthusiastic
advocate of BOT, in highway and bridge-building as well as the energy
sector.
Under the BOT system, the contractor would assume the risk of financing the
Lavrion project, paying off the debt with revenues earned from operating the
plant for 25 years before transferring it to Deh.
Mr Stefanos Manos, economy minister, argues that Deh's poor management
record and huge debt, amounting to Dr900bn (Pounds 2.7bn)leaves the
government with no alternative but to turn to the private sector.
'With such a high level of debt, Deh can't go on commissioning turnkey
projects. But almost everyone is opposed to letting in the private sector,'
he says.
Both management and unions voice doubts whether a private contractor can
produce electricity at cheaper rates than Deh. In private, however, they
sound more concerned about jobs and influence being lost.
Almost every extended Greek family has at least one member employed or on
pension from one of the big state enterprises used by politicians for making
patronage appointments.
'The politicians think they won't be elected unless they get their voters
jobs and public sector managers don't want to upset cosy relationships with
suppliers and contractors. The government isn't being determined enough
about privatisation,' says Mr Stelios Stavridis, a private consultant
recently appointed to oversee the privatisation of Aspropyrgos Refinery.
The government's record on privatisation was not helped by revelations that
officials at Calcestruzzi, a subsidiary of Italy's Ferruzzi group which paid
Dr124bn last year for a state-owned cement producer, Heracles General
Cement, were involved in paying kickbacks to Italian politicians.
However, privatisation officials brush aside allegations that some smaller
companies included in the privatisation programme were sold on favourable
terms to Greek businessmen with close ties to the conservative New Democracy
party. So far, about 70 companies out of 200 originally listed for
privatisaion have been disposed of.
The socialist opposition has been quick to exploit the government's
discomfiture, pledging that if it returns to power in the election next
year, it will re-examine privatisation deals and reverse any BOT contract
signed by Deh.
Mr Mitsotakis says the government is still committed to BOT financing for
the Lavrion project. However, the decision to start the tender process over
again, ostensibly to ensure maximum transparency, smacks of political
expediency. There is little likelihood that tender procedures can be
completed in time for a contract to be awarded before the election next
year.

FT  07 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Teams tackle 'market access'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL and ANTHONY MCDERMOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and the European Community have set up technical teams to study their
different interpretations of 'market access', Mr Mike Espy, US agriculture
secretary, said yesterday.
Market access, or the lack of it, has been a serious stumbling-block in the
Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks held under the aegis of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The decision to set up these teams was reached in recent talks in Brussels
with Mr Rene Steichen, EC farm commissioner. The teams are expected to
complete their task before the G7 meeting in Tokyo in July.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said on Wednesday that US and EC
trade negotiators had made 'some progress' in talks to produce a 'large
market access package'.
The two are negotiating in 12 industrial product areas, and in most of them
they are 'getting very close' to agreement to reduce the tariffs on both
sides to zero.
Last November, the US and the EC ended a five-year bilateral row over
oilseeds when the EC agreed to limit its planted acreage. Under the accord -
the so-called Blair House agreement - there would be an output limit of 9.7m
tonnes on this year's crop yields, or 11m tonnes on the basis of last year's
yields.
Mr Espy said he regarded the Blair House accord as a 'bilateral discussion'
but one which was 'already concluded'. But the definition of market access
remained 'very vague'. If it was not clarified, the Uruguay Round would not
pass through the US Congress.
But progress towards broader enactment of these reforms would be 'a slow
journey'. He criticised French opposition to the Blair House agreement,
although the approach under the new government of Mr Edouard Balladur had
been more restrained. 'The angriest protesters, ' Mr Espy said, 'are ones
with tractors - especially if those protesters speak French'.

<TEXT>
THE EC competition commissioner, Mr Karel Van Miert, wants to take six
countries to the European Court for maintaining monopolies on the import and
export of gas and electricity.
He told a conference on competition policy yesterday that such a move would
give all member states a 'clear warning that things will change' in the
energy sector, where Commission liberalisation plans have made little
headway.
Mr Van Miert alleges that Denmark and France have retained monopolies on the
export and import of gas to other EC countries, while Spain, France, Italy,
Ireland and the Netherlands have monopolies in electricity transit, contrary
to treaty rules. The infringement was so obvious he did not see how the
court could fail to back the Commission's hard line.
The EC has adopted directives to free up the transit of electricity and gas
across EC borders. Proposals to open up the energy sector to greater
competition are stalled as many states oppose 'third party access' to the
networks.

FT  07 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Claims accord aims to boost ship financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A NEW international convention on maritime liens and mortgges, adopted
yesterday by more than 60 maritime nations, is expected to encourage ship
financing by giving mortgage lenders improved security on their investment.
The convention defines a restricted list of maritime liens that can take
priority over registered mortgages. It was adopted by a plenipotentiary
conference in Geneva convened by the UN Conference on Trade and Development
and the International Maritime Organisation.
In the event of a forced sale of a ship, the claim of the mortgage lender is
currently subordinated to a host of maritime liens - claims against the ship
which have priority over all others and which travel with the ship
irrespective of owner or flag. They are enforceable in law, making it
possible to arrest and sell the ship to satisfy the claim.
Maritime liens vary from country to country and are not necessarily
recognised by others, so that creditors cannot be sure that claims will be
recognised and in what order of priority. Unctad officials believe this lack
of uniformity has handicapped ship financing and fleet development,
especially in developing countries.
The maritime liens entitled to priority treatment under the convention
cover: wages owed to the master and crew; death or injury claims against the
vessel; salvage rewards; pilotage, port, canal and other waterway dues; and
claims for physical loss or damage against the ship, other than damage to
cargo, containers or passenger effects.
Countries can grant other maritime liens on a vessel but they will rank
below registered mortgages in priority for claims. In addition, holders of
such maritime liens cannot benefit from payments of 'hull insurance' if the
ship sinks, and their claims lapse within certain short fixed time limits.
The convention opens for signing in New York in September and will come into
force six months after 10 states have agreed to be bound by it.

VENEZUELAN President Carlos Andres Perez has urged the Supreme Court to end
uncertainty over his political future, and over the national economy, by
deciding immediately whether sufficient cause exists to impeach him.
Since March 11, the court has been studying a petition filed by the
attorney-general to impeach Mr Perez over alleged improper use of Dollars
17m in government funds.
The matter came to a head this week when the press revealed that Chief
Justice Gonzalo Rodrguez Corro had drafted a pro-impeachment opinion and
sent copies to the other 14 members of the court.
The full court has not yet issued a ruling - it has about two weeks in which
to do so - but publication of the chief justice's opinion pushed the
president to write to the court.
News of the chief justice's letter had appeared in the press on Wednesday,
pushing the Caracas stock exchange down more than 5 per cent. Venezuela's
external debt bonds also weakened on international markets.
If a president cannot perform his duties, the chairman of Congress becomes
acting president for up to 30 days. Mr Octavio Lepage, the chairman, lost to
Mr Perez in the 1988 race for the ruling Democratic Action party's
presidential nomination. Mr Lepage has opposed the president's free market
policies over the past four years.

VENEZUELAN President Carlos Andres Perez has urged his country's Supreme
Court to end uncertainty over his political future by deciding immediately
whether sufficient cause exists to impeach him.
In a letter released yesterday Mr Perez said: 'The nation's tranquillity and
the development of its economic activities, in particular, make it urgently
necessary that the decision on whether or not to try the chief executive be
clarified immediately.'
Since March 11, the court has been studying a petition filed by the
attorney-general to impeach Mr Perez over alleged improper use of Dollars
17m in government funds. A successful impeachment would force a president
out of office for the first time in Venezuela's 35 years of democracy.
The matter came to a head this week when the local press revealed that Chief
Justice Gonzalo Rodrguez Corro of the Supreme Court had drafted an opinion
calling for impeachment, and that he had sent copies of it to the other 14
members of the court.
The full court has not yet issued a ruling - it has about two weeks in which
to do so - but publication of the chief justice's opinion pushed the
president to write to the court.
News of the chief justice's letter had appeared in the press on Wednesday,
amid false rumours said that the president had resigned, pushing the Caracas
stock exchange down more than 5 per cent. Venezuela's external debt bonds
also weakened on international markets.
Under the constitution, if a president cannot perform his duties, the
chairman of Congress becomes acting president for up to 30 days. Mr Octavio
Lepage, the chairman and long a leader of the ruling Democratic Action
party, lost to Mr Perez in the 1988 race for the party's presidential
nomination. Mr Lepage has opposed the president's free market policies over
the past four years.
During the 30-day period, the two chambers of Congress, the Senate and House
of Representatives, are required by the constitution to choose from among
themselves a president to serve out the rest of the current term.
Mr Perez, elected to a five-year term by a strong majority, is due to reach
the end of his term in February next year. Whatever happens, he is not
allowed to succeed himself.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Energy tax risks being cut to death
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's proposed energy tax has run into more opposition
this week as it starts its journey through the committees of Congress.
While business and farm groups have embarked on a campaign to kill the tax
altogether, the greatest danger to the administration's plans appears to be
the likelihood of a string of exemptions and loopholes.
These would reduce the estimated Dollars 73bn the tax is expected to raise
over five years, and also weaken its secondary purpose of encouraging energy
efficiency.
The administration had already made concessions between the first
announcement of the tax and publication of its details. Bowing to pressure
from maize-growing states such as Illinois, it agreed to exempt ethanol and
methanol, and also exempted home heating oil in deference to concerns from
icy New England.
But members of Congress from oil-producing states are keen to make further
changes to the bill, such as moving the point of collection downstream away
from the oil well or coal mine. And some representatives of farming
communities are pushing for a blanket exemption for agriculture.
The tax will be levied in general at a rate of 25.7 cents per million
British thermal units, with a surcharge of 34.2 cents per million BTUs on
refined petroleum products.
Many members of Congress have their own concerns about the tax. Montana's
Senator Max Baucus is worried about the effect of the tax on the aluminium
industry, a heavy energy user, and representatives from other northwestern
states, which get much of their electricity from dams, are arguing for
hydro-electric power to be exempted like most renewable energy sources.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Productivity growth grinds to halt in first quarter of year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE surge in productivity growth that marked early stages of the US recovery
ground to a halt in the first quarter, the Labour Department reported
yesterday.
Productivity (output per hour) in all non-farm businesses declined at an
annual rate of 0.1 per cent, relative to the fourth quarter of last year -
that quarter had shown a productivity growth of 4.1 per cent compared to the
previous one.
Productivity grew by 3.3 per cent over the whole year - the biggest jump in
a decade.
The slowdown was restricted to the service sector of the economy.
Manufacturing productivity grew at an annual rate of 4.8 per cent over the
fourth quarter, and was 5 per cent higher than in the equivalent period last
year - the best performance since 1977.
A deceleration in overall productivity growth was inevitable after increased
hiring in the first quarter and a sharp reduction in growth of gross
domestic product.
Most analysts, however, believe the productivity slowdown is temporary.
Economists at Merrill Lynch, the New York financial services group,
predicted 2-3 per cent productivity growth for this year as a whole: 'In our
view, the long-term productivity trend may have risen to 2 per cent a year -
double the pace of the past 20 years.'

<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S Congress has taken an important step towards approving
controversial government proposals to introduce a private pension fund
system.
The lower house of Congress approved a substantially altered version of a
government bill, introduced last August. This now goes to the senate, where
the government has a majority.
It is not expected to undergo further fundamental modifications.
The government says a privately managed pension fund system is needed to
develop Argentina's capital markets and provide industry with long-term
finance.
It would also remove a heavy financial liability from the government, which
is running a social security system riddled by deficit.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Clinton appoints Gore aide to crack whip in the White House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday named Mr Roy Neel, a veteran aide to
Vice-President Al Gore, as a new deputy White House chief of staff, with the
mission to concentrate on immediate political priorities.
The White House yesterday also partly confirmed a Wall Street Journal report
that it was considering a delay in its health care reform package until the
middle of next month, so as not to overload the legislative agenda.
Ms Dee Dee Myers, White House press secretary, said Mr Neel will focus on
day-to-day operations while Mr Mark Gearan, the other deputy to Mr Thomas
'Mack' McLarty, the chief of staff, will engage more in long-term planning.
This suggests that Mr Neel, aged 47 and an aide to Mr Gore while the latter
was a senator, is meant to bring discipline to an enthusiastic White House
staff that lacks some political experience. Mr McLarty himself is new to
Washington.
This week, Mr Clinton had admitted that his administration needed to get its
priorities straight and probably had lost some focus as it presented
initiative after initiative to the Congress and to the public.
It has also proved hard for the president to concentrate on domestic issues
as foreign exigencies - first, aid to Russia, and now the Bosnian problem -
have commanded more and more of his time.
The elevation of Mr Neel, well regarded in Washington, is seen in some
quarters as a setback for Mr McLarty, an Arkansas businessman long close to
the Clintons. However, he seems to retain their confidence and is popular
with the staff. Mr Clinton said this week that he simply needed some extra
experienced help.
The health care proposals might now be delayed until mid-June in the hope
that, by then, Congress will have made substantial progress on the critical
budget process. This was the advice tendered by Mr Leon Panetta, budget
director, in an interview last week, and it has been urged on the White
House by Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, whose ways and means committee is
considering the budget bill.
Health care reform was to have been announced by May 1, but this deadline
was deferred partly because Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton, chairman of the task
force, had spent several weeks in Arkansas with her dying father.
Even now, there is no guarantee that Congress will have completed most of
the work on the budget bill by the middle of next month. Several of its tax
proposals, including those on energy and investments, are under heavy fire.
If they go down, the administration will need to find deeper spending cuts
in order to meet its ambitious deficit reduction goals.
Indeed, if the budget process is turning out badly, with a series of
setbacks for Mr Clinton, then sweeping health care reforms, already
controversial in so far as they are known, are likely to be given a dusty
reception.
In general, the administration seems now more willing to compromise with
Congress. This week, it has scaled back its plans for the mass vaccination
of children, now to be confined mostly to the poor.
There have been further delays and probable modification to its proposals
for reform of electoral campaign finance, reflecting stiff opposition from
the majority Democratic party. Mr Neel is expected to be pivotal in deciding
what to send to Congress, and in what form.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Freeze on assets clouds Ecuador's debt talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS between Ecuador and its bank creditors over restructuring of
Dollars 6.5bn in medium-term debt have been complicated by a senior
creditor's attempt to secure a debt repayment.
The creditor, the Zurich-based Weston Compagnie de Finance et
d'Investissement, secured last week from a court in New York a pre-judgment
order to freeze the assets of the Republic of Ecuador and other state
entities. Weston was demanding repayment of Dollars 20m in various
syndicated loans it had bought at a discount in the secondary market this
year.
The order, yet to be confirmed, froze some assets of the state-owned oil
shipping company Flopec. However, Ecuador's central bank said that, 'due to
opportune precautionary measures' it had taken, the country's international
reserve position had not been affected.
Mr Michael Strauss, a New York lawyer for Weston, said his client had
requested payment from the government 'before it was forced, by the
defendant's refusal to pay, to commence action in the courts.'
Talks between the government and creditor banks, led by Lloyds of Britain,
over debt rescheduling have been moving slowly. Banks want Ecuador to resume
partial interest payments stopped last July, suspecting the government is
trying to depress the secondary market price of its debt in preparation for
a buy-back.
They have objected to a government proposal, made in December, which
suggests holders of debt should tender it in a unified auction for cash or
financial instruments.
The banks also dislike Ecuador's lack of explicit recognition of overdue
interest - which accounts for Dollars 2.2bn of the Dollars 6.5bn under
negotiation - and say the discount of nearly 70 per cent being sought is
excessive.
In response, they have suggested a more conventional, 'Brady-style' debt
reduction agreement, named after former US treasury secretary Mr Nicholas
Brady. Banks would exchange debt for two types of concessional bonds and a
discount of 35 per cent.
This structure is similar to that agreed in principle this week between
creditor banks, led by Bank of Nova Scotia, and the Dominican Republic. This
agreement, covering Dollars 775m of debt and Dollars 265m of arrears, allows
for an exchange of debt for two types of concessional bonds, a discount of
35 per cent and separate treatment of overdue interest.
The Ecuadorean government says it needs bigger concessions.

<TEXT>
IG METALL, Germany's powerful engineering union, yesterday extended its
indefinite strike action to 13 more enterprises, with the ailing steel
industry particularly targeted.
More than 35,000 eastern German steel, metal and engineering workers from 70
enterprises are now on strike in support of higher wage claims. They are
demanding the reinstatement of a March 1991 contract, which Gesamtmetall,
the metal and engineering employers association, cancelled last month. The
contract was aimed at equalising eastern and western wages by next year.
Wages in eastern Germany are about 60 per cent of western German levels.
IG Metall said the strikes would continue, and spread. However, it said the
union would try to renew negotiations in the Saxon capital of Dresden which
had broken down earlier in the week.
Negotiations between the union and employers were due to start last night in
Rostock, in the northern state of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, the heart of
the dwindling shipbuilding industry.
Industrial orders in the west German economy dropped another 3 per cent in
March, and seasonally adjusted unemployment rose in April, confirming that
the economic recession is still deepening, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn.
The only hopeful indicator was that the rate of increase in unemployment has
slowed slightly in the past month, but the headline figure for the country
as a whole remains above 3.3m.

THE UKRAINIAN parliament yesterday moved to block big domestic energy price
rises by imposing a moratorium on the increases until May 18, when the
government's powers to rule by decree will run out.
Mr Viktor Pynzenyk, deputy prime minister and architect of the government's
economic reforms, told the legislature its ban on price rises - resulting
from higher rates Ukraine must pay for Russian oil and gas - had no legal
validity. His assertion reflects a dispute between parliament and government
about the extent of the government's authority to rule by decree.
In the face of increases in the cost of Russian fuel, Ukraine had no choice
but to raise domestic prices, he said. Russian officials have said that
later this month they will increase the price Ukraine pays for gas by 50 per
cent, bringing it to within 60 per cent of world prices.
The Ukrainian government boosted electricity prices fivefold and raised coal
prices by up to 300 per cent. Mr Ivan Herts, minister for foreign economic
relations, said he was preparing to shift to world prices in all trade with
Russia on July 1.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin yesterday promised a purge of officials who
opposed his reforms and said he wanted parliamentary elections to be held
this year, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Mr Yeltsin said the referendum was the green light for reforms being
hindered by the conservative parliament headed by chairman Mr Ruslan
Khasbulatov.
He said senior officials were blocking reforms and he would instruct Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and heads of regional administrations across
the country to review the performance of their employees. 'Those who do not
share our aims should simply leave so as not to interfere with our work,' he
said.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of France yesterday reduced its key interest rates for the fifth
time since the centre-right government took power in the March parliamentary
elections, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
The cuts, which brought the intervention rate down from 8.25 per cent to 8
per cent and the 5-to-10 day short-term lending facility from 9.25 per cent
to 9 per cent, had been widely anticipated by the markets because of the
franc's recent resilience against the German D-mark.
Yesterday's cuts also illustrate the growing confidence of the French
authorities, which have previously tended to wait for the Bundesbank to
announce cuts in German rates before trimming French rates for fear of
renewing pressure on the franc in foreign exchange markets.
However, the Bank of France made its announcement early yesterday without
waiting for the outcome of the Bundesbank's fortnightly meeting. The German
authorities eventually decided not to cut interest rates.
Both Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, and Mr Edmond Alphandery, finance
minister, have made it clear that French rates should fall further to
alleviate the pressure on the economy.
Yesterday's cuts came at the end of a week of gloomy economic news,
including an official business survey reporting a deterioration in
confidence since the start of the year.

THE EMBATTLED German political establishment was thrown further into
disarray yesterday with the enforced resignation of Mr Gunther Krause, the
transport minister and most senior east German left in the cabinet of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Coming only three days after the resignation of Mr Bjorn Engholm, the leader
of the opposition Social Democrats, the sacking - in all but name - of Mr
Krause for a series of petty political blunders seems certain to undermine
further the good standing of the entire political class.
It also seems likely to delay the whole process of railway reform and
eventual rail privatisation being debated in the German parliament.
Mr Krause was forced to quit by Chancellor Kohl after revelations that he
had claimed public funds for moving his home from Berlin to a smart new
villa on the Baltic coast, after he was appointed a minister in the Bonn
coalition.
Mr Kohl, who was reported to have exploded with fury when he confronted Mr
Krause over the latest mini-scandal on Wednesday, has moved with
extraordinary speed to stop the rot. He immediately announced the
appointment of Mr Matthias Wissman, the minister for research, to take over
as transport minister, and Mr Paul Kruger, a little-known eastern member of
the Bundestag, to succeed him as research minister.
No fewer than seven cabinet ministers have now resigned abruptly from the
German government since the last elections in December 1990.
None of the so-called scandals has been substantial, but all have served to
fuel a feeling of public disenchantment with the country's leading
politicians.
On Monday Mr Engholm, the SPD leader and premier of the northern state of
Schleswig-Holstein, resigned all his public positions after admitting that
he misled a parliamentary inquiry five years ago. In the southern state of
Bavaria, the premier, Mr Max Streibl, is under fierce attack for accepting

INDUSTRIAL orders in the west German economy dropped another 3 per cent in
March, and seasonally adjusted unemployment rose in April, confirming that
the economic recession is still deepening.
The only hopeful indicator was that the rate of increase in unemployment has
slowed slightly in the past month, but the headline figure for the country
as a whole remains above 3.3m, with rates of 7.1 per cent in the west, and
14.7 in the east.
Industrial orders for west Germany were hit by a 4.2 per cent drop in export
orders in March, compared with February, against a fall of just 2.5 per cent
in domestic orders. The 3 per cent month-on-month drop in March was the same
as in February, after a surprising 5.5 per cent growth in orders in January.
The actual unemployment figure in April was slightly down on the previous
month, but the improvement was less than normal for the time of year.
Seasonally adjusted, it shows an increase of 35,000 in west Germany.
The unadjusted figures showed joblessness in the west down 0.1 per cent to
2.2m, and in the east down 0.3 per cent to 1.1m. The east German figures
continue to understate the real problem of unemployment in the former
Communist state, because tens of thousands are involved in job creation
schemes.

THE UKRAINIAN parliament yesterday moved to block big domestic energy price
rises by imposing a moratorium on the increases until May 18, when the
government's powers to rule by decree will run out.
Mr Viktor Pynzenyk, deputy prime minister and architect of the government's
economic reforms, told the legislature its ban on price rises - resulting
from higher rates Ukraine must pay for Russian oil and gas - had no legal
validity. His assertion reflects a dispute between parliament and government
about the extent of the government's authority to rule by decree.
He also pointed out that in the face of increases in the cost of Russian
fuel, Ukraine had no choice but to raise domestic prices.
Russian officials have said that later this month they will increase the
price Ukraine pays for gas by 50 per cent, bringing it to within 60 per cent
of world prices.
The Ukrainian government boosted electricity prices fivefold and raised coal
prices by up to 300 per cent. Mr Ivan Herts, minister for foreign economic
relations, said that on the prime minister's instructions he was preparing
to shift to world prices in all trade with Russia on July 1.
Ukrainian prime minister Leonid Kuchma, and his Russian counterpart, Mr
Viktor Chernomyrdin, are scheduled to meet on Monday to discuss bilateral
economic relations.
But the Ukrainian parliament's rejection of the price increases has put it
and the government on a confrontation course likely to break into open
conflict over faltering economic reforms on May 18.
Mr Kuchma has said he will insist not only on extension of his present
authority but will demand the right to legislate without parliamentary
approval and that the central bank and State Property Fund, the
privatisation body, be brought under cabinet control.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Italy's new prime minister, yesterday pledged to
introduce electoral reform based on the system of majority voting before the
summer parliamentary recess.
The former central bank governor, outlining his programme before parliament,
said electoral reform was an absolute priority. But he also stressed the
importance of introducing corrective measures to the 1993 budget and of
drawing up the 1994 budget by July.
His commitment to reform and promise of quick legislation looked likely to
ensure that his government, finally formed on Tuesday, would gain the
necessary support in a vote of confidence due today.
Mr Ciampi is counting on the slim majority of the four parties in the
outgoing Amato coalition - the Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social
Democrats and Liberals.
The main opposition parties, the former communist Party of the Democratic
Left (PDS), and the populist Lombard League, said yesterday they would
abstain.
However, a measure of Mr Ciampi's difficulties was evident in the
conflicting demands upon the government. Mr Ciampi talked of his government
being 'transitional' and, by seeking to complete electoral reform by the
summer recess, a number of deputies assumed that he was aiming for autumn
elections.
Against this, the economic part of his programme, committed to speeding up
privatisation and introducing the 1994 budget, suggested the government
could have a longer life. The Christian Democrats in particular urged him
not to announce in advance a time-span for the government and they clearly
hope he can last until next year, so allowing the party to reorganise. The
same applies to the Socialists.
There were significant developments in Italy's corruption scandals
yesterday. In Naples Mr Antonio and Mr Lucio Cirino Pomicino, brothers of Mr
Paolo Cirino Pomicio, the former finance minister and the leading Naples
Christian Democrat politician, were arrested on charges of extortion. Rome
magistrates arrested Mr Angelo Iacorossi, a leading entrepreneur in the oil
and construction business, on corruption charges. Mr Pietro Tradico, a board
member of TPL (Technologie Progetti Lavori), a leading civil engineering
company, has been arrested on charges of falsification of accounts.

<TEXT>
SENIOR European Commission competition officials said yesterday they were
still torn between changing the rules for examining large EC mergers in
Brussels - and possibly upsetting member states - and leaving the current
successful system unaltered.
Speaking at a conference on competition policy organised by Club de
Bruxelles and backed by the Financial Times, Mr Karel Van Miert, competition
commissioner, said he would discuss the issue with national governments and
competition authorities. If changes to the EC's 1990 merger rules were
necessary, he said he would table proposals before the end of June.
Anti-trust authorities in France, Germany and the UK are suspicious of the
Commission's desire to lower thresholds above which it automatically
examines mergers.
Consultations with nearly 300 companies and industry associations have
already revealed a majority in favour of expanding the Commission's powers.
But Mr Philip Lowe, new head of the task force which investigates alleged
competition abuse, told the same conference there were concerns such a move
might damage good relations between Brussels and national authorities. 'He
(Mr Van Miert) is quite aware we don't want to kill the goose that laid the
golden egg,' he said.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Bosnia on the Brink: Clinton urges Europe to back decisive
action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was one overriding message in US President Bill Clinton's stern but
measured reaction to the vote by the Bosnian Serb assembly, and it was not
directed at a Balkan leader, but squarely at western Europe.
'America is willing to do its part,' he declared, 'but Europe must be
willing to act with us. We must go forward together.' In case these words
were insufficiently clear, he talked of the dangers of 'further instability
in other parts of Europe that could be exceedingly damaging'.
He had ordered his secretary of state, Mr Warren Christopher, now in Europe,
to be 'insistent that the time has come for the international community to
unite and act quickly and decisively'.
He would not act 'rashly' in Bosnia, he said. The US was seeking 'not to do
things that would draw the US into a conflict not of its own making and not
of its own ability to resolve'.
This is perhaps the first public recognition by Mr Clinton that the
divisions between the US, western Europe and Russia over what to do next in
Bosnia are serious. There have been plenty of reports of the problems Mr
Christopher has encountered on his mission but no admission from the
president himself that they could not be overcome.
His warning reflects the most fundamental of political realities at home,
reinforced almost daily by senior members of congress, that there is a
minimal domestic constituency for US intervention in Bosnia unless it is
part of a collective operation.
Mr Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House foreign relations committee, was
yesterday merely the latest in a long line of political heavyweights to
wonder if the US would be right to act alone.
Military strikes, he said, were probably now more likely than before,
'though not, I think, for a few days'. But, he added, 'there really is great
confusion as to what the American national interests are and what we ought
to do'.
Mr Clinton has probably still bought himself a little time, at least now
until the conclusion of the Christopher mission, suddenly more vital than
ever, or some outcome in the UN Security Council acceptable to the US.
But the US political and public discontent with Europe is now quite
palpable. Senator Richard Lugar, the Indiana Republican just back from
Russia and the Balkans, expressed some sympathy with the European dilemma,
pointing to its problems of waging a war while in recession, but he also
warned of the wider consequences to the continent, from Greece to Germany,
if the conflict were not stopped.
Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, who had travelled with Mr Lugar, talked of
militarising the current UN presence in Bosnia and of setting a clear
deadline for offensive strikes. Like Mr Clinton and Mr Christopher in
Europe, neither thought the promised Bosnian Serb referendum should be
considered a factor. Both stood foursquare behind Mr Clinton.
In the current and intensifying US debate, less attention and justification
is now being accorded to the moral imperatives in Bosnia, though the
president again referred yesterday to 'ethnic cleansing that offends the
world's conscience and our standards of behaviour'.
But, having spoken, Mr Clinton was back working the international telephone
lines, with President Francois Mitterrand of France reportedly first on his
immediate agenda.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Bosnia on the Brink: Belgrade cuts off supplies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER, REUTER and DAVID OWEN

<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Serbian-controlled rump state of Yugoslavia yesterday declared a
blockade against Bosnian Serbs for all but humanitarian supplies, in a swift
and stinging response to their rejection of the Bosnian peace plan, report
Laura Silber and Reuter from Belgrade.
Its action could stem the flow of arms and fuel that has sustained the
Bosnian Serb war machine through 13 months of war against the republic's
Moslems and Croats.
It also implied that Bosnian Serb leaders would be made to leave the
Yugoslav capital Belgrade, where Serbia said they were living in comfort
while their people suffered.
If enforced, the cut-off of supplies is likely to hit the self-styled Serb
state in Bosnia hard. Its only roads not blocked by war are those leading
through Serbia and Montenegro, which comprise what remains of Yugoslavia.
Western diplomats believe the sanctions will devastate Serb-held territory,
already impoverished after a year of war. Despite some military petrol
reserves, Bosnian Serbs depend on Yugoslavia for fuel. 'They are utterly
dependent on petroleum coming via the Serbian pipeline,' said a diplomat.
The measures were announced by the Serb and Yugoslav federal governments
hours after the Bosnian Serb assembly ignored pleadings from Serb and
Yugoslav leaders to support the UN-brokered peace plan.
'Aid to the Bosnian Serb republic should in future be reduced to just food
and medicines in quantities to be established by the competent ministries,'
a Serbian government statement said.
'Reasons no longer exist for further assistance in money, fuel, raw
materials etc,' the Belgrade-based news agency Tanjug quoted the statement
as saying. The Yugoslav federal government issued a similar decree.
The bitterly worded Serb government statement condemned the assembly vote,
couched in a decision to put the peace plan to a Bosnian Serb referendum on
May 15-16, as irresponsible and said the 'economic bleeding' of Serbia after
12 months of UN sanctions had become intolerable.
David Owen adds: Mr John Major, UK prime minister, speaking in the House of
Commons, earlier urged Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic to close
Serbia's borders with Bosnia, cut the supply of weapons and other goods, and
'all other possible pressure on the Bosnian Serbs'.
At the same time the government signalled its continued resistance to
allowing arms to be supplied to the Bosnian Moslems. Stating that military
options such as air strikes had not been ruled out, it indicated that the
next step in forcing the Bosnian Serbs to accept the plan on Bosnia must be
to tighten sanctions.

discomfort

AS Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis of Greece drove back from Pale
yesterday, he must have wondered what, if anything, had been gained from his
attempt to mediate in the Bosnian crisis.
Mr Mitsotakis had calculated that his appearance beside President Slobodan
Milosevic of Serbia at the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament could help
swing the vote in favour of accepting the Vance-Owen peace plan.
In the event, he was unable to repeat the achievement of last weekend's
summit in Athens. Then, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the international
mediators, had both stressed the Greek prime minister's contribution to
persuading Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, to accept the plan.
Mr Mitsotakis's plea to the Bosnian Serbs not to 'commit collective suicide'
by rejecting the plan fell on deaf ears. Once again, the relationship
between Greece and Serbia looked embarrassingly intimate.
If Mr Mitsotakis had hoped to divert attention from the government's
domestic problems with a display of statesmanship, he must now expect
redoubled criticism for failing to complete the deal.
However, Greece is not likely to weaken its ties with Serbia, its
traditional friend in the region, and, in the Greek perception, a deterrent
to possible efforts by Turkey to extend its influence in the Balkans.
This attitude has caused friction with Greece's western allies, not least
because of the government's apparent unwillingness to crack down on Greek
businessmen and shipowners suspected of breaking the United Nations embargo
on trade with Serbia and Montenegro.
Much of the fuel still reaching Serbia comes from Greece. It may be shipped
by truck through Bulgaria by a local company set up in collaboration with a
Greek exporter, or delivered by a Greek-owned tanker at a port in
Montenegro.
Mr Mitsotakis also asserts that other Balkan countries should not
participate in a military intervention in Bosnia, a view not shared by
Turkey, the only other Nato member in the region.
Greece's refusal to send aircraft to help enforce the UN no-fly zone over
Bosnia, while permitting Awacs surveillance aircraft involved in the
operation to use a Greek air force base in western Greece, underlines the
contradictions of its attempt to balance the obligations of Nato membership
with support for Serbia.
The government also put up a well-publicised show of resistance before
permitting Turkish F16s to fly through Greek airspace on their way to join
the contingent enforcing the no-fly zone. A similar difficulty over the role
of a Greek destroyer, assigned to the international task force enforcing the
UN embargo in the Adriatic, was resolved through an understanding that the
Greek ship would not be ordered to enter Montenegrin territorial waters.
However, Mr Mitsotakis has done much in recent months to shore up relations
with Greece's other Balkan neighbours.
The dispute over recognition of Macedonia, which made Greece so unpopular
with its European Community partners last year, is well on the way to being
resolved.
Mr Vance is to act as a mediator at UN-sponsored talks on finding a
compromise name acceptable to Greece and implementing confidence-building
measures.
Greece has also managed to put ties with Albania on a better footing,
proposing co-operation in everything from military training to banking and
agricultural reform, while the government is promoting military co-operation
with Bulgaria and is loosening foreign exchange restrictions to support
fast-growing Greek trade and investment there.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Bosnia on the Brink: West misjudges a stubborn nationalism -
Owen puts faith in Milosevic; US wants quick action; UN to create 'safe
areas'; Bosnian Serbs triumphant / Rejection of the peace plan has left the
outside world as divided as ever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE rejection by the Bosnian Serb parliament of the Vance-Owen peace plan
for Bosnia leaves the international community with the same agonising
choices as before the Athens summit of the warring parties last weekend.
After the combined pressure of the west, Russia and Serbia had forced Mr
Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, to sign the plan, many of the
world's leaders had confidently predicted that the Bosnian Serb assembly
would follow suit. But they were wrong.
Once again, they underestimated the stubbornness and mystical nationalism of
the Bosnian Serbs and the cunning of their leader, who made his signature
conditional on his assembly's approval of the plan.
In spite of the impassioned pleas of Balkan leaders such as President
Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis of
Greece, they effectively voted down the plan dividing Bosnia into ten
semi-autonomous provinces, by an overwhelming majority in what was described
by Lord Owen, one of the two mediators, as an act of 'dangerous folly'.
The task confronting the western allies and Russia if the Bosnian Serb
assembly had approved the peace plan would have been difficult enough. By
common agreement, implementation of the plan would have required the rapid
deployment of 70,000 international peacekeeping troops to monitor the
withdrawal of the warring parties' forces and heavy weapons to designated
areas and to patrol provincial borders and throughways.
But with the US and Russia both agreeing to provide substantial forces,
coupled with the willingness of France and Britain, with peacekeeping troops
already on the spot, to increase their contributions, the task was not as
insuperable as at first appeared. Such a deployment, however, has almost
certainly been indefinitely postponed. None of the potential contributing
nations, including the US, is prepared to risk the lives of their
peacekeeping troops in a war situation. They would only be sent in to
oversee the implementation of a peace agreement once it had been endorsed by
all the warring parties, not to impose it by military force.
At the same time there is no agreement yet, even between the US and its
western allies, on the precise alternative strategy to be pursued in the
event of a final rejection of the peace plan by the Bosnian Serbs, as
discussions between Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, and
European leaders have shown this week.
Mr Christopher has found no takers for his proposal that the international
arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia should be lifted selectively to
help Bosnian Moslems. Britain and France are the strongest opponents of such
a move, because they believe that it would not only prolong the conflict but
endanger their peacekeepers on the ground and the UN's humanitarian
operation.
The other military option proposed by the US - surgical air strikes against
Bosnian Serb supply lines - has also been greeted with little enthusiasm by
Britain, France and Russia. Air strikes have not been ruled out by any of
the government leaders whom Mr Christopher has seen, but they have all made
clear that further discussions would have to take place before embarking on
such a step. Mr Christopher himself repeated yesterday that the US did not
want to act unilaterally but in concert with other members of the western
alliance.
Following yesterday's failure to endorse the peace plan, the chorus in the
US, EC and Nato in support of 'tougher measures' has again reached a
crescendo, but such sentiments will not be translated into military action
until it is specifically authorised by a Security Council resolution.
'Our focus will be very sharp on the new stronger measures,' Mr Christopher
said in Brussels yesterday after seeing EC and Nato ministers. However, in
European capitals, there still appears to be a residual hope that military
intervention can be avoided, in the immediate future at least, and that the
new package of tougher sanctions will bring the Bosnian Serbs to their
knees.
Lord Owen, while recognising that the international community was 'getting
closer' to military intervention in Bosnia, nevertheless spoke out against
rushing into such a decision. In common with British and French leaders,
Lord Owen appears to be putting his faith in the Russian and Serb leaders,
Mr Boris Yeltsin and Mr Milosevic, to reverse the Bosnian Serb assembly's
decision.
That faith seemed to be rewarded last night when Serbia announced it was
halting all but humanitarian supplies to the Bosnian Serbs - a measure
earlier urged by both Lord Owen and Mr John Major, the British prime
minister.
But the cutting of a key supply line for the Bosnian Serb army may have had
more to do with the humiliation Mr Milosevic suffered when the Bosnian Serb
assembly so decisively ignored his appeal to them to accept the peace plan.
However, while the watchword in Europe remains an intensification of
pressure, mainly in the form of an economic blockade, the signs are that
President Bill Clinton may be losing patience. He said last night the
Bosnian Serbs' rejection of the peace plan 'threatens to widen the conflict
and foster instability in other parts of Europe.' The time had come for the
international community to unite and act quickly and decisively, the
president emphasised. That does not sound as if Washington is prepared to
wait much longer for the Bosnian Serbs to change their minds.

AS the sun rose yesterday over Mount Jahorina above Sarajevo, a silent and
frustrated President Slobodan Milosevic, accompanied by Greek Prime Minister
Constantine Mitsotakis, his closest international ally, piled into their
Mercedes. They had failed to persuade the Bosnian Serb parliament to accept
the Vance-Owen plan.
In contrast, exhausted but triumphant deputies called the outcome of the
17-hour session 'a victory of the people and against western dictates'.
Burly guards in camouflage uniforms pushed journalists away from the
closed-door session as the vote was taken. A weighty majority, 51 out of 65
votes cast, reaffirmed their decision of last week to hold a referendum on
May 15 and 16 in their self-styled Srpska Republika, which covers about
two-thirds of Bosnia.
Mr Radoslav Brdjanin, a key hardliner from Banja Luka, the bastion of Serb
radicals in north-west Bosnia, praised the failure of deputies to kowtow to
western pressure and politicians from Belgrade who 'don't understand the
situation'. 'Let the Americans bomb. They'll never win, we made the just
decision. The only possible one,' he said.
General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander, in a blustering and angry
briefing to the deputies dismissed as biased the proposed maps, which he
said would 'bring horrible consequences'. His soldiers were not afraid of
military intervention, he boasted.
The deputies' refusal to ratify the peace plan has set them on a collision
course with Mr Milosevic, who told the 73 deputies gathered at the Heavenly
Valley hotel above Sarajevo: 'We cannot afford to lose everything we have,
staking it all and losing like a drunken poker player.'
But only two members of the assembly backed the Serbian president, who in
the past has brilliantly outmanoeuvred political challengers.
Mr Nenad Veselinovic, the mayor of Pale, dismissed the visit of the Serbian
and Yugoslav leaders: 'We knew what these speeches were going to be. They
didn't need to come all the way here. They have the right to think what they
want. But the reality on the ground is very different from what they think
it is.'
Mr Milosevic responded last night by cutting off supplies to the Bosnian
Serbs, a move that carries political risks, as he so far has been bolstered
by nationalist support within Serbia. Ultra-nationalists and an unofficial
ally of Serbia's ruling Socialists, such as Mr Vojislav Seselj, a Belgrade
parliamentary deputy and paramilitary commander, are likely to whip up fears
by protesting against the isolation of their kin in Bosnia.
Yugoslav President Dobrica Cosic, appearing worn and grim, yesterday called
the vote 'the worst possible decision'. 'It is disastrous. I don't know what
the next night and day will bring to this country,' said Mr Cosic, one of
the architects of the plan to create a Greater Serbia.
But defiance was the dominant theme among Bosnian Serbs yesterday. Mr
Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, tried to paint the decision to
hold a referendum as postponement rather than a rejection of the plan to
divide Bosnia into 10 ethnic provinces. Despite having signed the plan in
Athens at the weekend, in Pale he described the maps as catastrophic. 'If
they accept, one half of the Serbian population will be in Moslem and
Croatian provinces and the other half in Nagorno Karabakh.'
Mr Ratko Adzic, the interior minister, warned: 'Surely against such a power
as Nato our losses would be very heavy. But we also remember what happened
in the Vietnam war and we ourselves have rich experience in guerrilla
warfare.
'If they make us really angry, we can launch a guerrilla campaign on their
territory, such as on nuclear power plants. If our children are dying why
should theirs live?'
Only a few Bosnian Serb leaders voiced uncertainty. Mr Milan Tesic, one of
the two opponents to the referendum, called the decision one of extreme
ignorance.
'I am obligated to support any agreement for peace. But they are voting for
war and they have managed to silence the others,' he said.
Despite the convincing defeat of the plan, several deputies, fighters, and
guests were visibly shaken after the marathon session. One delegate in
military garb said: 'It is a frightening and unwise decision. Who knows what
will happen to us now?'
