FT  07 MAY 93 / Bosnia on the Brink: UN weighs new measures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE United Nations Security Council held urgent consultations yesterday in
an atmosphere of deepening crisis as members weighed new measures in
response to the Bosnian Serb rejection of the Balkans peace plan.
As a first response, the Council was expected to approve a resolution
designating Sarajevo and the Moslem enclaves of Zepa, Gorazde and Tuzla
'safe areas' which would be patrolled by UN troops. These would be similar
to the operation being conducted by Canadian forces in Srebrenica.
However, the Third World countries sponsoring the proposal made it clear
that the measure would be inadequate in itself. There were again calls for
what one delegate termed 'surgical military intervention' by an
international force.
Mr Diego Arria of Venezuela, who led a Security Council mission to Bosnia
last month, speaking in his role as the non-aligned members' spokesman,
called the safe areas proposal symbolic and a minimal response to
developments in a deeply troubling situation.
'These new elements should force the international community to act in a
much more affirmative way,' he said.
The use of force was 'looming' because the past inadequacy of UN measures
had only encouraged Serbian intransigence.
Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary general, and the US were in sharp
disagreement last night over who should control an expanded UN military
operation that might eventually be authorised by the Council.
In a working paper for members, he insisted that political and strategic
direction must come from the UN through himself. Washington is demanding
that the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation be in command.
Russia is willing to provide troops but supports Mr Boutros-Ghali on the
issue of UN control. France also wants a UN-directed force, not simply one
with UN blessing.
The working paper calls for up to 70,000 troops, at least 20,000 of whom
would be Americans, for the largest ever UN military operation.
American Admiral Jeremy Boorda, the Nato commander in southern Europe, has
been mentioned as the likely commander. If Mr Boutros-Ghali's proposals
prevailed he would report to Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the former Norwegian
foreign minister, who is the UN special representative, succeeding Mr Vance.
Mr Boutros-Ghali last night refused to accept that the Bosnian Serbs had
spoken the last word on the peace plan. Negotiations must continue 'to
overcome current difficulties', he said in dismissing suggestions that the
Vance-Owen proposals were now moribund if not dead.

FT  07 MAY 93 / SFO failed to halt Nadir's flight despite tip-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, KYRENIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Serious Fraud Office was tipped off early last Sunday that Mr Asil
Nadir, the former chairman of Polly Peck International, was about to flee
the country, but did not take special measures to prevent his flight.
The tip was passed to the Metropolitan Police, who issued a routine warning
to major ports and airports but decided not to launch a surveillance
operation on Mr Nadir.
A warrant was issued in London yesterday morning for Mr Nadir's arrest, two
days after his flight to northern Cyprus.
The SFO yesterday acted to counter criticism by issuing a statement saying
that the tip had been the latest of numerous similar claims, all of which
had previously proved false.
The authorities in northern Cyprus distanced themselves from Mr Nadir, who
hitherto has been seen as a hero on the island. Mr Rauf Denktash, president
of the self-proclaimed republic, told the Financial Times that Mr Nadir's
flight would provide confirmation for those who saw the island as a 'haven
for criminals'.
He added: 'Legally we can do nothing. The only way out is for moral pressure
to be put on Asil Nadir to choose between going back to face the music or
staying here and making us suffer for it.'
This is the first time President Denktash has openly criticised the fugitive
Cypriot businessman and is seen as a measure of the growing concern of the
possible diplomatic fallout for the government in Nicosia.
Turkey, which has bankrolled the territory since Turkish forces occupied the
northern part of the island in 1974, was also urging action yesterday. Mr
Tugay Ulucevik, Turkey's special envoy on the Cyprus talks, raised the
matter in a meeting with Mr Denktash. Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, a Foreign
Office minister, summoned the Turkish ambassador in London, Mr Candemir
Onhon, to a meeting, but later cancelled the appointment to answer questions
in the Commons.
The meeting, at which Mr Garel-Jones will urge Turkey to put pressure on
northern Cyprus to ensure Mr Nadir's return to the UK, is now due to take
place this morning.
The northern Cyprus council of ministers was meeting yesterday in special
session, at Mr Denktash's request. Meanwhile, Mr Nadir told journalists
outside his house that he would explain his plans today.
Mr Nadir later sent a fax from Cyprus to the Foreign Office in London
offering to come back in return for a guarantee that all bail restrictions
would be lifted. The Home Office said no such guarantee could be offered.
Turkish officials are concerned that Turkey's relations with the UK could be
damaged by the affair.
The UK has no extradition agreement with northern Cyprus, but should Mr
Nadir go to Turkey, a legal dispute over his extradition could arise.
The flight of Mr Nadir coincided with the winding down of a highly secret
investigation by the Metropolitan Police into allegations that a plan
existed to use bribes of up to Pounds 3.5m in an attempt to influence the
outcome of Mr Nadir's trial.
As their investigations proceeded, those involved in the inquiry reached the
conclusion that, while some attempt to interfere with the legal process
might have been planned, it was not of the degree of seriousness at first
suspected.
Detectives found no evidence of Mr Nadir's involvement in the alleged plot.
The investigation is now understood to have, in effect, been completed and
no charges are expected.

FT  07 MAY 93 / City security row flares as bombed offices report looting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW QUESTIONS were raised yesterday over security in the City of London
after it emerged that a number of buildings damaged by the IRA bomb in
Bishopsgate have been looted in the past week.
City companies, including the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, whose 26-floor
tower was severely damaged, disputed police statements that responsibility
for securing the bomb-damaged buildings rested solely with their owners.
The looting incidents, it emerged yesterday, all occurred after police last
Friday handed over responsibility for security in the 21-acre cordoned-off
area around the site of the explosion to the Corporation of London and
private security groups employed by the owners of the affected buildings.
The most serious incident appears to involve 99 Bishopsgate, owned by the
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. Several tenants allowed back in the building for
the first time on Tuesday discovered evidence of widespread pilfering.
According to the bank, the latest incidents to be discovered affected three
floors, including offices previously occupied by the Saudi International
Bank. Additional damage and theft were reported yesterday by tenants on
other floors.
A spokeswoman for the bank gave no details of the thefts but said: 'There
has been pilfering and damage not caused by the bomb. Desks and cupboards
have been rifled through and things have gone missing.'
Police were also called into the area at the weekend after security staff
working for the bank reported suspected looting of several shops.
Another international firm said last night: 'We discovered that our offices
have been looted. Cupboards had been forcibly opened, someone had tried to
break into our safe, and several items have been stolen.'
The City of London Police said yesterday five arrests had been made at the
weekend and they were investigating the latest Hongkong Building incident.
Detective Chief Superintendent Thomas Dickinson of the City CID said the
security of the buildings was the responsibility of the occupiers and their
security companies.

FT  07 MAY 93 / Clinton warns of unstable Europe: US seeks early accord with
EC states on tougher measures against Bosnian Serbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, JUREK MARTIN and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, WASHINGTON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton of the US yesterday warned that the Bosnian Serb
assembly's rejection of an international peace plan for Bosnia, in defiance
of possible air strikes by the US and its allies, threatened the stability
of Europe.
He expressed his 'great disappointment' at the assembly's decision, adopted
by an overwhelming majority of 51 votes to 2 with 12 abstentions early today
and called on the international community 'to unite and to act decisively.'
The president said he had instructed Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of
state, to be 'insistent' during his current tour of European capitals that
tougher and collective measures be agreed soon.
Mr Christopher vowed to concentrate efforts to end the war exclusively on
punitive measures against the Serbs and said he was no longer pursuing a
United Nations peace plan.
Speaking in Bonn after meeting German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Klaus
Kinkel, the foreign minister, Mr Christopher said the failure of the Bosnian
Serb parliament to back the peace plan meant that option was now closed.
The White House later said that a new UN Security Council Resolution would
be required if further action in the form of air strikes or other military
measures were to be taken.
Meanwhile, the Security Council held urgent consultations in an atmosphere
of deepening crisis as members weighed the various options in response to
the Bosnian Serb assembly's rejection of the peace plan.
As a first response, the Council was expected to approve a resolution
designating Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, and the Moslem enclaves of Zepa,
Gorazde and Tuzla, as 'safe areas' which would be patrolled and, if
necessary defended, by UN troops.
Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian Moslem foreign minister, claimed in
Washington yesterday that 40,000 people would be 'massacred' in the besieged
town of Zepa if the international community did not intervene in Bosnia's
civil war.
Bosnian Serb forces have refused to allow a team of five UN military
observers to visit Zepa to investigate Bosnian government charges that a
full-scale Serbian assault had been launched.
Serbia last night announced it would cease all but humanitarian supplies to
Bosnian Serbs. 'Reasons no longer exist for further assistance in money,
fuel, raw materials etc,' the Serbian government said in a statement carried
by the Belgrade-based news agency Tanjug.
Earlier Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Lord Owen urged
Serbia to seal its border with Bosnia, thus depriving the Bosnian Serbs of
further weapons and other supplies.
In spite of their shared anger at the Bosnian Serb assembly's decision, Mr
Christopher and European Community ministers were unable to reach agreement
on how best to step up pressure on the Bosnian Serbs at a meeting in
Brussels.
Both sides insisted on the need for a united response and left open all
military options. But there were differences in emphasis that may require
until next week to sort out.
Britain and France, in particular, strongly oppose any lifting of the
international embargo on arms sales to Bosnia and also have reservations
about air strikes against Bosnian Serb supply lines, although they have not
ruled them out as a last resort.
The EC countries' position was broadly summed up by Lord Owen, the
Community's mediator, who described the Bosnian Serb assembly's decision as
'a dangerous folly', but cautioned against hasty military action.
'It is a matter of pressure, relentless pressure. Do not rush in with
bombs,' he said, although conceding that the time for military measures had
been brought a step closer.
He insisted that the Serbian leader had the power to reverse the decision by
depriving the Serb military of essential arms and other supplies.

FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: Microsoft and Sun join battle
over software
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPUTER software battle has erupted between Sun Microsystems, the leading
manufacturer of computer workstations, and Microsoft, the world's largest
computer software company.
Sun has challenged Microsoft's dominant position in the software market by
announcing the joint development with Unix Systems Laboratories of
technology allowing Unix computers to run word processing, spreadsheet and
database applications designed for use on personal computers running
Microsoft's Windows operating system.
Sun said its new technology, known as Wabi and based on work by Praxsys
Technologies, would enable Unix system users to run Microsoft Windows
applications 'right out of the box'.
Until now this could be done only by using a software 'emulator' that acted
like a personal computer, degrading the performance of a Unix computer. Sun
claimed that, through Wabi, the performance of Unix computers running
Windows applications would be about 50 per cent higher than other computers
using the Microsoft's Windows operating system.
Sun's move is a pre-emptive attack on Microsoft's imminent high-performance
version of Windows, known as Windows NT.
Mr Scott McNealy, Sun Microsystems chief executive, said: 'We are taking
(Microsoft's) Windows volume standard and making it 'open'.' Computer users
would be able to exploit Windows applications without being dependent on
Microsoft, he added.
But Microsoft has announced it would also offer programmes enabling Windows
applications to run on Unix computers and Apple's Macintosh machines.
Microsoft questioned Sun's performance claims for Wabi. Mr Bill Gates,
chairman and chief executive, also said Microsoft would check Wabi for any
infringement of intellectual property rights. But Sun argued Wabi
technology, available to software developers in about 90 days, contained no
Microsoft technology.

FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: MCI wins Dollars 80m JP Morgan
deal

<TEXT>
MCI Communications, the second-largest US long-distance telecommunications
group, has beaten AT&amp;T, of the US, and BT, of the UK, to win an Dollars 80m
five-year contract to operate one of the global communications networks of
JP Morgan, the New York banking group.
The deal with one of the world's most blue-chip banking groups is a
significant coup for MCI, which, like other leading telecommunications
groups, is keen to build a presence in the expanding global 'outsourcing'
market - the trend for multinational companies to contract their global
communications needs to an industry expert.
MCI will team up with Infonet Services, which is jointly owned by some of
the world's leading telecommunications companies. MCI will provide
integrated voice and data network services to more than 20 Morgan centres in
North America, Europe, Asia and Latin America.
The deal is a blow to BT's fledgling Syncordia unit, based in Atlanta,
Georgia, which was set up to capitalise on multinational outsourcing, but
has found it hard to gather rapid momentum.
Both BT and AT&amp;T, the leading US long-distance company, were awarded
contracts with JP Morgan last year covering other aspects of global
communications, but these were far smaller than the MCI contract.

It says although WSTV is meant to support itself financially its present

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community will today ask the US to ease market access for
European exporters, as part of a 'fair and balanced' settlement of
outstanding disagreements in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation
talks.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner for external relations, is looking for
significant concessions from the US in areas such as textiles and services,
in order to persuade EC member states that the whole package - including
liberalised farm trade - is acceptable.
His idea seems to be to put together a broad enough package deal to persuade
the French government, in particular, to drop its objections to the farm
trade compromise negotiated by the European Commission last year.
After talks in Bonn yesterday with Chancellor Helmut Kohl Sir Leon held out
the hope of EC and US trade negotiators reaching 'some kind of breakthrough'
in the Gatt negotiations in time for the Tokyo summit of the Group of Seven
industrialised states in July.
A timetable of negotiations, including a meeting including Canada and Japan,
has been agreed with that aim in mind.
Sir Leon is flying today to Washington with Mr Jacques Delors, Commission
president, for meetings with both President Bill Clinton and Mr Mickey
Kantor, the US trade representative, at which both sides hope to reopen the
remaining issues in the Gatt trade talks.
'We have a long way to go, but I have no doubt of the American desire to go
the whole way,' he said. 'They have joined me in setting a series of dates
for meetings which will show our resolve. The aim is to reach some kind of
breakthrough in time for the G7 summit in Tokyo,' said Sir Leon.
A final agreement would have to be reached by December 15, the date when the
'fast track' negotiating authority granted to the US administration by
Congress finally expires. 'I really do believe this deadline is the last
one,' Sir Leon said.
He said the EC would now focus on the key question of market access. US
import tariffs were in general much higher than EC tariffs, with textiles
and services two areas showing a big disparity.
'We want to show the people of Europe that we gain something from an
agreement,' Sir Leon said. He is simply turning a blind eye to French
demands for renegotiation of the agricultural part of the EC-US package,
insisting that a deal has been done.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Loans for Poland approved

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank has approved Dollars 750m of new loans to Poland in another
move which strengthens the country's attractiveness to foreign investors.
The latest loan agreements follow approval last week by parliament of the
privatisation of more than 600 enterprises. Six weeks ago, the International
Monetary Fund agreed a Dollars 660m standby loan after the parliament
approved a tight budget.
The bank is lending Dollars 300m to help modernise Polish farming and
Dollars 450m to support the Polish government's enterprise and bank
restructuring and privatisation (EBRP) programme. The new loans bring the
bank's commitment to Poland to Dollars 3.5bn since 1990.
The EBRP programme has been designed to speed privatisation of the banking
system, improve banking supervision and refinance the bad debts of
enterprises which clog bank balance sheets. Last month, Wielkopolski Bank
Kredytowy became the first big Polish bank to be privatised. The 20 per cent
of shares allocated to small investors was heavily oversubscribed.
Christopher Bobinski adds from Warsaw: Thousands of Polish teachers
yesterday underlined the problems caused by tight IMF-imposed budget deficit
limits by striking for higher pay which the government cannot finance
without breaching the 5 per cent budget ceiling limit.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Central Europe's big mistake: Lack of bank reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, East European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE failure of post-communist central European states to make bank reform
and re-capitalisation of the banking system top priority has emerged as
their biggest single policy error, according to a progress report on
economic transformation in central Europe.
Published by the European Commission and the London-based centre for
Economic Policy Research (CEPR), the report notes that price liberalisation
and financial stabilisation programmes have been successful in the Czech
republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia but that further institution building
is required to liberalise labour, housing and above all capital markets.
It criticises the 'fast track' central European reformers for
'over-emphasising stabilisation at the expense of systemic transformation
which has itself concentrated unduly on privatisation at the expense of
wider structural change.'
While stabilisation policies managed to prevent hyper-inflation, they
exacted an unduly heavy price in output and employment. The steep fall in
output was exacerbated by the collapse of Comecon trade and the failure to
establish a payments clearance system to manage trade between the former
Soviet satellites. The unexpectedly sharp decline in economic activity was
due largely to 'the unanticipated negative supply side effects as many large
state owned enterprises effectively forced banks and suppliers to roll over
past loans and capitalise arrears so that a greater than intended real
credit squeeze hit the small emerging private sector disproportionately'.
In this the experience of central Europe differs markedly from that of the
less developed countries where the application of a standard policy package
managed to halt chronic inflation almost instantaneously without serious
short term output costs.
To overcome the specific problems faced by reforming post-communist
economies the authors of the report, Prof Richard Portes, director of the
CEPR and Prof Mario Nuti, call on international institutions and governments
to implement a six-point programme involving recapitalisation of the banks;
incentives for better management of state enterprises; the introduction of
modern VAT and other taxes; incomes policies linked to creation of effective
social safety nets; creation of secure legal frameworks for foreign
investment and greater regional co-operation to restore lost intra-Comecon
trade.

FT  06 MAY 93 / IMF puts conditions on Hungary credit accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY has reached a 'gentleman's agreement' with the International
Monetary Fund which clears the way for a new credit facility and the
country's return to financial respectability.
Under the accord, agreed in Washington this week by Mr Ivan Szabo, the
finance minister, and Mr Peter Bod, the central bank governor, Hungary
promised to bring the country's wayward public-sector deficit down from more
than 7 per cent of gross domestic product in 1992 to 5.5 per cent next year.
The Hungarian authorities plan a package of tax increases and spending cuts.
Some will come into effect this year but most will bite only in 1994.
Government officials were confident the measures would pass through
parliament this month, allowing the formal signing of the accord with the
Fund afterwards. An upward statistical revision of Hungary's GDP will make
the targets easier to meet.
In return the IMF will disburse a credit of SDR560m (Dollars 394m) over this
year and next. Clearance will also release a Dollars 100m tranche of the
World Bank's structural adjustment loan to Hungary.
The agreement ends a year of embarrassment for Budapest since the Fund
called the alarm on Hungary's budget deficit suspended the country's
three-year SDR1.14bn credit.
The resumption of IMF funds will have a marginal direct impact on the
financing of Hungary's Dollars 21.4bn gross foreign debt, the largest per
capita in eastern Europe.
The National Bank of Hungary, the central bank, has had little difficulty in
raising a record Dollars 2bn through international bond issues in the past
six months.
But the IMF's blessing is psychologically important. It should make
international capital markets 'even softer' for Hungary, Mr Frigyes
Harshegyi, NBH deputy president, said yesterday.
The economic benefits of budgetary restriction may come at a heavy political
price, however, for Hungary's conservative coalition government. The package
would hit voters' finances in the run-up to scheduled elections in spring
1994 which the opinion polls say the government will lose heavily.
Hungary's difficulties with the IMF began last year when recession, a
collapse in taxable profits at banks and companies, and tax evasion, caused
government finances to buckle.

FT  06 MAY 93 / New election in Hamburg could hit main parties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH Germany's main political parties could end up the losers from an
extraordinary legal decision to order a new state election in the city of
Hamburg, the second smallest of the country's 16 Lander.
The move, ordered by the constitutional court in the city because of an
'undemocratic' selection process of candidates for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union, means a re-run of the poll held in 1991.
It is the first time a state election has had to be repeated since the
foundation of the federal republic.
Yet in spite of the blame lying clearly at the door of the CDU, the biggest
losers could be the Social Democrats.
The 1991 election in Hamburg, Germany's second largest city after Berlin,
was won by the SPD, with an absolute majority of just one seat, but it could
now face serious defections because of the disarray of the party at national
level.
Although the SPD welcomed the decision yesterday, it is in chaos following
the resignation on Monday of its leader, Mr Bjorn Engholm, and a rapid
outbreak of infighting over the succession.
An immediate opinion poll in the city showed the Social Democrats gaining
just 40 per cent of the votes, compared with 48 per cent in 1991.
The CDU, however, is also lagging in popularity nationally, thanks to the
sharp economic recession, and the high costs of German unification. The fact
that the city party has been found guilty of undemocratic procedures in its
own candidate selection seems likely to lose it further support.
The same opinion poll, carried out by the Dortmund-based Forsa institute,
puts the CDU on 34 per cent, one point down on 1991.
The new election therefore opens the way for widespread protest voting
against the main political establishment, with probable gains for fringe
parties such as the Greens and the extreme right-wing Republicans or
Deutsche Volksunion (DVU).
A large proportion of non-voters is also to be expected, given the
circumstances of the election.
The Greens were supported by 16 per cent of voters polled yesterday,
compared with just 7.2 per cent in 1991, while non-voters showed an increase
from 35 to 39 per cent.
The court decision is a serious embarrassment for Mr Kohl's CDU, which was
accused of not allowing minority groups to propose alternative candidates to
the party list put forward by the leadership. The party failed to observe
the inner-party democracy required by the constitution, it said.
However, the SPD is in no position to exploit its position. Campaigns are
gaining momentum for a whole variety of candidates for the national party
leadership. The front runner is Mr Gerhard Schroder, the current premier of
Lower Saxony, but he also faces strong opposition for apparent disloyalty to
Mr Engholm.

FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: US Treasury shortens debt
maturity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Treasury yesterday announced plans to cut the cost of the federal
debt by reducing the amount of 30-year bonds and increasing the amount of
shorter-dated securities it sells to investors.
The announcement ended months of speculation in the US bond market. For more
than a year the Treasury had been toying with the idea of shortening the
maturity on government debt as a means of reducing the federal interest
burden. The government pays out a lower interest rate on shorter-dated
securities compared with longer-dated securities, such as the 30-year bond.
The changes will not be introduced immediately, because the Treasury is
going ahead with its auction of bonds later this month, although the size of
that issue has been cut by several billion dollars. In future, however, the
Treasury will cut the frequency of bond issues from three months a year to
only one every six months a year.
To compensate for the reduction in bond issuance, the Treasury will increase
its quarterly sales of shorter-dated securities with maturities of three
years and less. The seven-year issue will be phased out altogether.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, described the changes as 'carefully
crafted and moderate,' designed to realise long-term savings on interest
costs. The extent of those savings was not specified, but President Bill
Clinton, in his budget, estimated that changes in the maturity of government
debt could save the country more than Dollars 16bn over five years.
In going ahead with the changes, the Treasury has chosen to ignore the
judgment of the borrowing committee of the Public Securities Association,
which advises the government on debt management.
The committee warned that shifting the debt load would lead to higher
short-term interest rates, which would not only hurt corporate borrowers but
also undermine the government's original objective of lowering its interest
costs.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Drivers oppose road fee scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT faces severe public hostility to its plans to impose an extra
charge on motorists for the use of motorways, the results of an opinion poll
published today show.
The poll suggests that 86 per cent of motorists are opposed to the idea of
paying an extra charge. Of these, 65 per cent say they are paying enough in
taxes already.
Later this month the government is due to publish a green paper setting out
its plans for using motorway and trunk road charges as a means of raising
cash to fund its programme of road building.
It is understood that ministers have ruled out the possibility of installing
toll collection points on existing motorways because these would take up too
much land and slow traffic.
Instead the government seems likely to suggest that drivers wishing to use
motorways should be required to buy an annual supplementary licence fee
until electronic technology makes it possible to charge for use of the roads
on a pay-as-you-go basis.
The poll of 1,079 motorists was carried out for the Royal Automobile Club by
Research Surveys of Great Britain in March.
It shows that 37 per cent of motorists say they will use motorways less
often if charges are introduced. Nearly all of those - 97 per cent - say
they will not drive less often but use other roads instead.
This will increase fears that pay-as-you-go charges might divert traffic on
to unsuitable city streets and country lanes, with unacceptable consequences
for the environment.
The RAC said the survey showed that extra charges would only be acceptable
if they were accompanied by a package of measures that gave a fair deal to
motorists, such as more by-passes and better main roads.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (17): ERM gamble pays
dividends for funds - Barry Riley discusses investment strategy in the past
seven months since Black Wednesday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR ago it seemed that the consensus among British pension fund managers
in respect of their investment strategy was threatened by the UK's
membership of the European exchange rate mechanism.
Typical exposure to equities had topped 80 per cent of portfolios, with
nearly 60 points of that in the UK stock market. It was a strategy well
justified by investment experiences in the 1980s but pension funds appeared
badly positioned for the 1990s if that meant an ERM-type environment of high
exchange rates and low inflation. In those conditions fixed interest
securities might do just as well as equities, and be less risky.
In the event the UK was forced out of the ERM and the pension funds' gamble
paid off. The UK is back in an environment of a fluctuating (and generally
declining) currency and inflation which appears to be stuck for the time
being at 3 1/2 to 4 per cent on an underlying basis and may, quite a few
economists believe, drift up to 5 per cent or more in the medium term if the
economic recovery is at all vigorous. Pension fund strategy has not changed
at all.
Certainly, pension fund portfolio managers do not appear to be taking at all
seriously the pledge of the chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, to bring
underlying inflation down within a range of 1 to 2 1/2 per cent by the end
of the present parliament - say, by late 1996.
Yet pension funds that shifted their investment strategies in favour of
bonds a year ago would not have done at all badly. In the year to the end of
April the total return on the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index was about 12 per
cent, while the corresponding return on long-dated UK government securities
was more like 15 per cent. The returns on Japanese, US, German or French
government bonds were much higher, expressed in terms of sterling.
Conventional wisdom at present is that only equities offer an appropriate
match for the liabilities of pension schemes with benefits linked to final
salaries, and with at least a degree of inflation-proofing (through limited
price indexation of up to 5 per cent, soon to be compulsorily applied to
pensions in payment as well as to deferred pensions). The underlying
assumption here is that in the long run dividends will grow in line with
nominal national income.
Until the 1950s, however, the view was quite different. Bonds were safe, and
equities were unacceptably risky. This conventional wisdom was overturned
because inflation became a persistent problem and once pensions became
linked to final salaries the mismatch was apparent.
It is important to realise, however, that the change in attitudes in the
1960s was related to a particular problem of negative real interest rates
that reached its most acute phase in the 1970s. During that decade the
average annual rate of return on gilt-edged was 8.1 per cent while inflation
averaged 13 per cent.
Once exchange controls on portfolio investment were removed late in 1979,
however, the real returns on sterling bonds had to rise to somewhere in line
with the positive levels offered by other leading countries. Indeed, in the
1980s the annual return on gilts was 14.7 per cent compared with inflation
of just 6.9 per cent. Admittedly equities performed better still during this
period.
If pension fund trustees can rely on consistently positive real returns on
bonds then their strategic dependence on equities can be reduced. After all,
there are also risks in equities - for instance, that dividend growth may be
very low over the next few years, because payouts have grown too large, and
also that tax policies may be further tightened so as to discriminate
against dividends, as has already happened in the latest Budget.
However, pension scheme trustees and their fund managersoften perceive risk
in different terms to the risks of particular investments. They are aware of
their own personal and business risks. The low risk position is to do what
other similar funds are doing, and if this turns out to be wrong it will be
a mistake emulated by many others. In these terms, a risk shared is a risk
largely evaded. But for the sponsoring company and the beneficiaries, of
course, the risk is not reduced at all.
The question therefore is how shifts in strategy can be achieved in a smooth
and orderly way, rather than in response to some investment disaster which
would make change an imperative.
The best solution is probably presented by the growing maturity of many
pension schemes - that is, they have fewer young contributing members and
more and more older and retired members. This opens the possibility of a
natural shift to a less risky and shorter-term investment strategy, matching
the change in the liability profile.
However, the actuarial science of asset-liability modelling is still flawed,
and views on the appropriateness of matching investments is subject to
fashions and distortions.
For trustees it is a challenging time. They are justifiably more comfortable
with the league table approach to performance measurement, in which the
comparison is with comparable peer funds, than with individual benchmarks
which may seem of limited relevance, and may make comparisons difficult.
The underlying fear is that the actuaries and fund managers will hide their
poor performance behind a smokescreen of mumbo jumbo which amateur trustees
cannot penetrate.
The story is told of the trustees who were discussing with their fund
manager a change to an index-related benchmark rather than a median
fund-related target. The investment manager wished to make his position
quite clear. 'We are quite happy to accept the change, but it will, of
course, mean that you will no longer be able to compare us with the median
fund,' he declared.
From somewhere at the far end of the room the low voice of one of the
trustees could clearly be heard. 'You see,' he muttered to his neighbour,
't'buggers are making excuses already.'

blow for the industry - Taxation / Is there a new hard line in government
thinking?

THE pension fund industry can be forgiven for its impression that a bout of
schizophrenia has overtaken government policy makers.
For while proclaiming the government's desire to see individuals take
greater responsibility for their own well-being in retirement, it has set in
train tax increases which could well have the opposite effect.
In casting about for ways to finance its burgeoning budget deficit, it is
not surprising that the Treasury should have focused on the tax breaks for
the pensions industry - a sum equal to Pounds 8bn a year by its own account.
However, the Institute of Fiscal Studies, in a report financed by the
National Association of Pension Funds, concluded that the tax breaks were
worth a far more modest Pounds 1bn per year and these are relatively modest
when compared against tax breaks offered in other countries.
Whatever view the industry takes of its own tax advantages, Chancellor
Norman Lamont's programme, outlined in his budget address in March, have
far-reaching implications for pension fund finance.
More worrying, perhaps, is whether they signal a new hard line in government
thinking on tax advantages for the pensions industry.
The budget contained two pieces of bad news for the pensions industry.
First, the pensions 'cap' - the level of gross salary upon which final
salary pension payments can be based and still attract tax relief - was
frozen at Pounds 75,000 for the 1993-94 fiscal year.
Second, and more important, the Chancellor reduced to 20 from 25 the rate of
dividend tax which tax-exempt investors such as pension schemes can reclaim
from the government. This move is expected to gain the government Pounds 1bn
a year in tax revenues, largely at the expense of pension funds.
'I think this is quite a clever move to reduce the tax breaks on pension
schemes,' said Mr Trevor Crowter, partner at KPMG Actuarial Services. Mr
Crowter notes that initially at least, there was barely a ripple of protest
from either the pension fund industry or scheme members. The effects of the
changes are too complex to be quickly understood, a fact which allowed Mr
Lamont to enact tax increases without losing political ground, he said.
But the effects of the changes cannot be easily dismissed. From April 6 this
year, income derived on the portion of pension portfolios invested in UK
equities will be cut by 6 1/4 per cent.
Because pension fund assets are valued not on the market price of underlying
securities but on cash flow - known as the discounted cash flow method - the
value of the assets pool will also have to be marked down.
'Companies will have to put in higher contributions or cut benefits,' said
Mr Andrew Wilson, research partner at consulting actuaries R Watson and Co.
Mr Michael Pomery, partner at consulting actuaries Bacon and Woodrow,
illustrates the effect of the change by citing the case of a client with a
surplus 4 per cent above liabilities.
The client, he said, has been preparing to distribute that as a benefit
enhancement to members. But the tax changes mean that to do so will leave
the scheme slightly underfunded, a consideration which has forced the client
to shelve plans for additional benefits.
Mr Duncan Roberts, pension finance manager at T &amp; N, the engineering
company, said the tax change is likely to knock Pounds 20m off the company's
pension scheme surplus when the next actuarial valuation begins this month,
thus hastening the day when the company's contributions holiday must expire.
R Watson's Mr Wilson notes that schemes hardest hit by the tax changes are
those with large numbers of current or deferred pensioners, few contributing
members, and an employer fallen on hard times who is relying on investment
income to meet liabilities. In effect, the tax changes will hit hardest
those schemes which can least afford to respond to them.
'The Treasury has spent nearly 10 years attempting to cancel or restrict the
so-called tax reliefs on pension schemes,' said Mr Robin Ellison, partner at
solicitors Ellison Westhorp and a specialist in pensions law. Mr Ellison
points out that the perceived tax breaks - most notably tax-free
contributions and tax-free roll-up of capital gains and income - is actually
a cash flow benefit. Eventually, members pay tax on both when they receive
their benefits, albeit possibly at a lower marginal rate than they would
have paid if tax had been assessed while they were employed.
Pensions experts say it is highly unlikely that the government will release
an onslaught of new taxes for schemes.
The department of social security, studying how best to restructure the
state's own basic pension, can ill afford to undermine occupational schemes
which have largely been responsible for improving living standards for
Britain's elderly over the past 15 years.
However, the treasury is said to be eyeing several changes, including the
abolition of the tax-free lump sum available to scheme members upon
retirement. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated this could save
treasury Pounds 3bn per year.
Meanwhile, the pensions industry is hoping for tax 'simplification' from the
Goode Committee, the gov-ernment's own advisory panel on occupational
pension reform. Mr Kevin Spring, partner at consulting actuaries Wyatt
Company, cites the anomaly of the simultaneous limit on the percentage of
gross salary which employees can put into a pension scheme tax-free and the
percentage of final salary which can be represented by pension payments.
'Either you tax it when it goes in or you tax it when it goes out. That
should be the principle,' he said.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (15): Focus on investors'
behaviour / A look at corporate governance after the Cadbury report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEBATE on the Cadbury report on corporate governance has tended to focus
primarily on the role of directors. Yet institutional investors are required
by Cadbury to play a key part in ensuring companies' compliance with the
Code of Practice that lies at the heart of the report. That role has been
strongly supported by the Institutional Shareholders' Committee, which
represents the main groups of institutional investors; and most institutions
have welcomed those aspects of the report that have already led to increased
disclosure and an improved framework of accountability in advance of the
recommended deadline.
The principle underlying the Cadbury committee's recommendations for
shareholders is that institutional investors collectively own a majority of
shares in listed companies and should therefore accept the responsibilities
of ownership. In practical terms, that boils down to:
A regular dialogue with senior executives on strategy, performance, board
membership and quality of management;
Positive use of voting rights, unless there is good reason not to use them;
and
Taking a positive interest in the composition of boards, to ensure proper
checks and balances, and the appointment of a core of independent
non-executive directors.
Since the committee regards voting rights as an important asset, and a vital
link in the chain of accountability from management to shareholders, it also
recommends that institutional investors should disclose their policies on
the use of voting rights.
Much of this constitutes a definition of current best practice. But the
voting requirement falls into a different category. A survey by the National
Association of Pension Funds showed not so long ago that four out of five
pension funds did not exercise their voting rights as a matter of course.
And many fund managers have complained about the administrative burden of
additional paper work that the Cadbury injunction implies.
Such complaints may well be misguided. For according to pensions specialist
John Quarrell at solicitors Nabarro Nathanson, pension fund trustees already
have a legal obligation to exercise votes. Nor, it seems, can discretionary
fund managers escape that responsibility. Customer service agreements under
the Financial Services Act, says Mr Quarrell, create a relationship that is,
in most cases, that of a quasi trustee or constructive professional trustee.
'In my view,' he says, 'investment managers with discretionary management
must exercise voting duties and interest in the way the companies they
invest in are managed.'
This implies that Cadbury may be asking for no more than what is already
required under trust law. But because the law takes materiality into
account, discretionary fund managers can find themselves under a greater
legal obligation than in-house managers. This is because their fiduciary
responsibilities are measured not by the percentage stake held by the
individual client, but by the aggregate stake of all the clients in an
individual company.
A handful of investors, including a number of local authority pension funds,
regard the exercise of all votes in relation to all their shareholding as an
important matter of principle. Others, including some leading City fund
management groups, argue that an active approach to voting responsibilities
is nonetheless compatible with a cut-off point. At Fleming Investment
Management, for example, votes are exercised for companies capitalised at
less than Pounds 1bn where Fleming holds 1 per cent or more of the capital;
with capitalisations of more than Pounds 1bn, it votes on stakes of half a
per cent or more. But an active stance is easier for those, like Fleming,
that have a sizeable research department to carry out the analysis that is
required for the responsible exercise of the vote.
The practicalities of exercising a vote where trustees delegate day-to-day
investment decisions to an external fund manager, but retain control over
voting, can be complex. If the shares are held in a pooled nominee account,
instead of the fund's own name, the fund manager usually receives only one
set of proxy material. Obtaining additional material can be a tortuous
business, severely squeezing the timetable for the exercise of voting
rights. The answer is to establish a segregated account.
One of the less publicised reasons that so many external fund managers have
preferred not to exercise their votes in the past is that they fear the
consequences for their business of being seen to be active in disciplining
company boards.
While fund managers may formally be paid for their services by the pension
fund, a majority of trustee boards are dominated by representatives of
company management. It is assumed, probably rightly, that managers have
little enthusiasm for tougher accountability exercised by fund managers in
the City.
Over a long period, British institutional investors have played a part in
securing changes in the boardroom, usually through deliberations with the
non-executive directors behind closed doors. Few of them are keen on those
bits of the Cadbury report which argue for a more active use of the annual
general meeting, for example, to question the chairman of the remuneration
committee over directors' pay.
Nor would it be easy in Britain to conduct the aggressive lobbying and proxy
battles that occur in the US. The threshold for proposing resolutions at
AGMs is simply too high. Pensions &amp; Investment Research Consultants (PIRC),
which runs a corporate governance and proxy voting service for UK pension
funds with assets of Pounds 14bn, argued in its submission to Cadbury that
the threshold for proposing a resolution at an AGM should be reduced and
that timetables for meetings should be more accommodating, so that
resolutions can be put and circulated. Cadbury took the point. In its final
draft the committee suggested that a successor body should look into the
issue.
But there are signs that a more active approach by shareholders to corporate
governance issues is beginning to have an impact. Anne Simpson, joint
managing director of PIRC, believes that the PIRC campaign against company
articles of association that insulate executive directors from the need for
regular re-election played a part in decisions by British Petroleum, TSB and
Commercial Union to amend their articles. One way or another, the Cadbury
report has put its mark on institutional investment behaviour.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (14): Reforms signal a
more regulated approach - Custody / Norma Cohen reviews the moves to tighten
control in the aftermath of the Maxwell scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS one of the quirks of the UK's investment scene that the custody
business is the one sector to escape unregulated. All indications are that
this anomaly is about to come to an end.
The death at sea of Robert Maxwell, chairman of Maxwell Communications
Corporation, sparked an investigation which revealed that more than Pounds
440m was missing from pension funds he controlled.
In the aftermath of the Maxwell scandal, a government appointed panel is
considering a wide range of options about how best to reform rules for
occupational pensions. Not least among these are some which relate to
custodians.
Meanwhile, the debate about custodial arrangements is occurring at a time
when UK pension schemes are taking a much harder look at their own costs,
including the costs of custody. A recent study from the National Association
of Pension Funds highlights custody as one of the services where there are
substantial hidden costs to the client. A study from management consultants
Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton indicates that no more than 50 to 60 per cent of
custodians fees are derived from the formal charges levied on clients with
the remainder coming from stock lending of client portfolios, interest
balances and foreign exchange activities.
Aided by the work of pensions consultants, some UK funds are taking an
increasingly critical view of their own custodial arrangements, both from a
cost perspective as well as safety and service. Some large in-house funds,
such as ESN Pension Management, the scheme of the privatised electricity
companies, have embarked on a campaign to force fund managers to 'unbundle'
their custodial and fund management services.
This has struck a raw nerve in the fund management industry which is
fighting hard against it. Mr Gordon Lindsey, managing director at Mercury
Asset Management's Custody and Investor Services Division, says that it
cannot charge for the services separately. 'If you wish to use a separate
custodian, you may. But we will charge you the same fee,' he said. He argues
that MAM would incur costs anyway in adjusting its data systems to
communicate with other custodians.
However, in the US, egged on by pensions consultants, pension schemes have
forced custodians to unbundle fees and cut charges. One large state pension
scheme has struck a deal with its custodian under which the custodial
service is free as long as the custodian may earn a turn by lending the
scheme's securities. If stock lending dries up, the scheme will have to pay
Dollars 400,000 to Dollars 500,000 a year in custodial fees.
But in the UK, the immediate headline issue in custody is that of safety.
Using a series of transactions labelled by Mr Maxwell's in-house and
independent fund managers as 'stock lending', ownership of shares passed
from the fund managers and custodians to other Maxwell-owned companies.
Although the practice bore little resemblance to formal stock lending in
which securities never actually change hands, the activities have thrown
open the whole question of how to ensure safe-keeping of assets.
The government-appointed Goode Committee, named for its chairman, commercial
law professor Roy Goode, is considering whether, in the light of the Maxwell
affair, pension schemes should be required to designate a custodian for its
assets which is separate from the fund manager. The commercial significance
of this question is not lost on either fund managers or custodians and the
battle lines have been quickly drawn.
On one side are the Forum for Independent Custodians, a group organised by
Royal Bank of Scotland, the largest independent custodian for UK pension
funds. On the other side are the leading fund managers, all of whom operate
their own separately capitalised custodial subsidiary.
The National Association of Pension Funds has suggested a more modest
measure which would require the use of an outside custodian for pension
schemes which are managed in-house. That suggestion has upset the UK's
largest banks which are both fund manager and custodian for their own
pension schemes.
The sums are not inconsiderable. More than two-thirds of the assets of
Lloyds Asset Management belong to its own pension schemes and Barclays de
Zoete Wedd manages more than Pounds 6bn of its pension scheme.
Members of the Goode Committee are circumspect about their likely
recommendations on custody. However, it is believed unlikely that they will
insist on outside custodial arrangements provided those of the fund manager
are separately capitalised and properly managed and audited.
Another issue yet unresolved is whether Maxwell-type theft could be avoided
if securities were required to be registered in the name of their actual
owner. Mr Michael Robarts, of Fleming Investment Management, argues that
designation not only offers little protection to clients but will also slow
down the settlement process, raising costs for everyone and increasing
risks. 'Chaos will ensue,' he promises. And because designation wil be under
the control of custodians, there is little to stop a larcenous outfit from
simply designating itself as the ultimate owner of share certificates.
Mr Robarts argues that instead of designating securities in the name of
clients, there should be tighter controls on custodians and strict limits on
which trustees have the authority to give orders for transfers of securities
to the custodians.
The suggestion seems to be falling on fertile ground. Already, several
accountancy firms have proposed model audits for pension fund custodians
designed to help trustees feel assured that the securities they think they
own are actually there. Even without regulation, this procedure is
increasingly likely to be built into a scheme's procedures.
Meanwhile, some members of the pensions industry have suggested that the UK
should adopt US-style Erisa legislation which requires custodians to refuse
to carry out orders which they believe or suspect are improper. That view
has been discussed with the City's chief watchdog, the Securities and
Investments Board, which is said to favour it.
Overall, pension fund custody, long a backwater of the industry, is
receiving scrutiny the likes of which it has never felt before. It is
inevitable that it will emerge in a different form.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (13): Still only
negligible exposure - Global Bonds / Richard Waters checks asset allocations
in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BONDS may have provided the best overall investment returns in the UK since
the beginning of the 1990s, but pension funds have maintained their almost
negligible involvement in the fixed income markets. If this is the decade of
bond, in the way that 1980s was the decade of the equity, then the asset
allocation decisions of pension funds are proving slow to register the fact.
In the past three years, the return from UK bonds averaged 15 per cent a
year, compared with 10.1 on UK equities, according to Combined Actuarial
Performance Services Limited (Caps), the performance measurement company.
That has reversed the pattern of the last decade, when returns on UK bonds,
at an average of 12.6 per cent a year, lagged the 18.8 per cent return on UK
equities.
Yet the median UK pension fund has continued to maintain only a negligible
exposure to the bond market. From a 21 per cent share 10 years ago, UK bonds
accounted for only around 4 per cent of pension fund assets at the start of
the decade, and over the past two years has levelled out at three per cent.
The growth of holdings of overseas bonds, particularly in 1989/90, has
helped to swell fixed income exposure to some 9 per cent in all, according
to Caps. With the UK debt repayments of the 1980s, and the consequent
shrinking of the gilt market, pension funds had to look abroad to maintain
their involvement in bond markets.
The relative outperformance of bonds and the starkly different picture
presented by the UK's finances could be set to change this. 'One thing that
characterises pension fund investment is that things always happen with a
time lag. I would expect a change in the percentage (of investment in UK
bonds) by the end of the year,' says Mr John Clamp, chief executive of Caps.
One simple reason for buying more bonds: because the UK government - and
indeed many other governments - are going to have to sell more to finance
their budget deficits. Pension funds may not be in the front rank of
investors queueing up for gilt-edged stock, but if private investors,
insurance companies and more fickle foreign investors cannot be persuaded to
buy more than Pounds 3bn of gilts a month, then yields will have to rise to
a level where other investors are drawn to the market.
Pension funds' holdings of gilts fell during the 1980s as the UK government
repaid part of the national debt. It seems logical to expect those holdings
to rise again now that the government is borrowing with a vengeance.
Such a shift in investment approach will be dressed up in more sophisticated
arguments than this, of course. Sterling's brief disinflationary sojourn in
the European exchange rate mechanism may have come to an abrupt end last
September, but the case for holding bonds rather than gilts remains a strong
one. The real yield on 10-year gilts is hovering around an unlikely 6 per
cent, if inflation can be held down at current levels. And for investors who
fear the resurgence of inflation, index-linked gilts have offered an
attractive return - 8.4 per cent since the start of the decade, only
marginally lower than the return on equities. Since sterling left the ERM,
the Bank of England has sold around Pounds 2.5bn of index-linked gilts, with
pension funds apparently active buyers.
Other factors also suggest a greater exposure to fixed income investments in
the future. The reduction in advance corporation tax announced in this
year's Budget will reduce the attraction of equity dividends to tax-exempt
investors like pension funds, adding to the relative attraction of bonds.
And holdings of bonds are widely expected to rise as pension funds become
more 'mature' (that is, have a higher proportion of retired members,
encouraging them to match their liabilities to these people by holding fixed
income securities.) Such funds are increasingly turning to tailor-made
benchmarks, which contain a higher proportion of bonds than the industry
average, against which to measure their performance.
While a noticeable swing towards gilts has yet to be seen, the emergence of
international bond investment has brought with it a greater use of
specialist fund management arrangements. Some funds, rather than tailor a
benchmark for their main balanced fund, have preferred to spin off separate
fixed income portfolios. Of the Pounds 4bn of fixed income investments
managed by Mercury Asset Management, Pounds 1.6bn takes the form of
specialist briefs from particular funds or investments tied to benchmarks
with a higher-than-average bond weighting, said Mr Nigel Hurst-Brown,
vice-chairman.
The push into overseas bonds has been largely tactical in nature, rather
than strategic: that is, fund managers in pursuit of higher returns have
sought and been allowed leeway to invest in overseas markets. If the UK only
accounts for 3 per cent of the global bond market, runs the argument, then
why limit yourself to such a small arena?
Most fund managers also appear to have run such portfolios with unhedged
currency exposures, counting on a continuation in the long-run fall of
sterling against most principal currencies. Beyond this, there appears to
have been little strategic motivation for the move into international bonds.
'Overseas bond investments (by pension funds) increased sharply in the late
1980s, but could decline just as quickly,' says one big UK pension fund
manager. That could be especially true if funds move back into gilts in any
volume, a step that could be supported in the short-term by a simple switch
from international to UK bonds without any change to overall investment
parameters.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (12): A measured step
forward - Derivatives / Tracy Corrigan reviews developments in recent years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE past few years, the use of derivatives by UK pension funds has
increased substantially, although fund managers still tend to confine
themselves to a limited number of products, designed to serve a limited
number of purposes.
Several important developments in recent years helped pave the way for
greater use of derivatives.
First, the tax position of derivatives was clarified in the 1990 Finance
Act. A year later, the Securities and Investment Board produced rules on
'efficient portfolio management', outlining when the use of futures and
options was an acceptable practice.
But fund managers agree that the most important landmark was the publication
of guidelines on performance measurement of derivatives last year. The
guidelines, developed by the London International Financial Futures &amp;
Options Exchange (Liffe) and Mercer Fraser, the actuarial consultancy, were
considered particularly important, because they allowed trustees to assess
more easily whether fund managers were using futures and options for
investment or hedging purposes, or for taking more speculative positions.
These standards 'laid down a benchmark,' according to Mr Tony Whalley,
investment director of Scottish Widows. 'The vast majority of pension fund
trustees take the view that if investment managers want to use derivatives,
they should be allowed to do so,' he said. However, certain pension funds
cannot use derivatives without changing their trust deeds.
The fact that these standards were approved by the National Association of
Pension Funds gave further weight to the argument for derivatives.
Last November, the Pensions Research Accountants Group (Prag), an
association of 200 UK pension fund practitioners, published a further
document on the use of derivatives by fund managers. Prag built on the work
by Liffe and Mercer Fraser, but broadened the approach to encompass
reporting and accounting of derivatives, as well as performance measurement.
In addition, Liffe has run regular derivatives courses designed specifically
to suit the needs of trustees, which are credited with fostering a broader
understanding of derivatives among pension fund trustees.
But many pension funds, sometimes in practice and sometimes because of
strict investment guidelines, limit themselves to a specific range of
strategies.
The most common use of derivatives is still for asset allocation. If a fund
manager buys futures on the FT-SE 100 stock index and holds a cash deposit,
he is creating a synthetic equity asset. It is usually cheaper and quicker
to gain exposure to the market by this method than by buying a portfolio of
stocks in the cash market. For example, if it is decided that a fund should
shift some exposure from the UK to the US stock market, two trades executed
in the index futures market could effect this change of strategy.
A shift in exposure between different asset classes, such as bonds and
equities, can also be executed in the futures market.
As there has been a broad shift of focus away from stock picking in favour
of asset allocation, the use of futures for this purpose caught a wave of
interest among fund managers.
Similarly, futures are often used for cash flow manage-ment. For example, a
fund manager faced with a sudden inflow of funds may decide to buy index
futures immediately, creating a breathing space before deciding on which
stocks to buy, or looking for bargains.
Another reason for the use of derivatives for asset allocation is that it is
one of the most straightforward applications of derivatives' technology.
The other most obvious use for derivatives is hedging exposure. If a fund
manager buys equities in the cash market and sells the future, he is hedging
against a fall in the stock market, (since the futures position will gain if
the market falls).
But, because the performance of a pension fund manager is often measured
against other funds, rather than against an index, a fund manager may be
unwilling to pay for such 'insurance', by buying options, or to forfeit some
of his potential gains by taking a position in the futures market. This also
explains the relatively small use of derivatives for 'index-tracking',
compared with other markets such as the US.
According to Mr Trevor Robinson, director, derivatives, at Fidelity
International, trustees are often convinced of the value of hedging, 'but
actuaries are not keen, because from an actuarial point of view, capital
value is less important than dividend payments.'
Generally, futures are far more widely used than options, which are more
complex derivative instruments. Futures are much easier to value, and
therefore more straightforward to use.
A futures contract obliges the holder to buy or sell at a set price at a
future date; an option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation,
to buy or sell at a set price at a set date.
Futures are of particular use in asset allocation, while options can be used
for stock selection.
Options are generally used to modify exposure, and their effect on portfolio
performance is asymmetrical - for example, a fund manager can buy a put
option on a stock to protect against potential losses in the stock, without
losing any potential gains. Because of the asymmetrical movement of options,
the price does not indicate how the option would react to changes in the
underlying market.
Although some pension fund managers sell options against their stock
portfolios, the use of options is still limited.
Similarly, most fund managers prefer to deal on exchanges, rather than in
the over-the-counter market, largely because of liquidity and credit risk.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (11): To hedge or not to
hedge - Currencies / 1992 gains have been unusually strong, says Norma Cohen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a year like the last one, pension fund managers may well ask
themselves if there is any good reason to bother hedging currency exposures.
Consider the facts. Last year, fund managers investing in US dollar-based
assets earned an additional 23.6 percentage points once the currency had
been converted into dollars, according to Combined Actuarial Performance
Services (Caps). Against the yen, it was equally impressive at 23.7 per
cent, 15.7 per cent against the D-Mark and 15.9 per cent against the French
franc.
'We have found it is not worth it to hedge,' said Caroline Burton,
investment director at Guardian Royal Exchange. 'We found last year, for
instance, that the currency gains in the Japanese stock market wiped out our
losses there,' she said. According to Caps, the Japanese equities market
returned negative 4.7 per cent last year, even when currencies were taken
into account.
Mr Robert Baker, pensions consultant at William M. Mercer, said that hedging
currency exposures remains the exception rather than the rule at most UK
pension funds, in spite of the increasing percentage of assets invested
abroad.
That partly reflects the gains which funds have recorded in recent years
from currencies. The Caps data show that within the past five years, 1992
currency gains have been unusually strong. But in the previous four, they
have been negligible and any effort to hedge would have been overshadowed by
the cost.
In the four years to the end of 1991, the US dollar appreciated 0.1 per cent
against sterling, while the yen sank 0.6 per cent. The French and German
currencies recorded gains of 0.9 and 1.0 per cent respectively.
Mr Alan Greenhorn, formerly head of quantitative active management at Hill
Samuel Asset Management, said the group had made a study of the benefits of
hedging for pension funds. 'In the long run, we found that the costs of
passive hedging far outweigh the benefits,' he said.
Mr Jeffery Davis, of State Street, the Boston-based bank and fund manager,
said that the benefits of currency risk management rise with the degree of
overseas exposure. 'It all really depends on what proportion of a pension
plan is devoted to non-domestic assets. If it is five to 10 per cent, as is
common in the US, then the benefits are insignificant in terms of reducing
volatility,' he said. 'But if you have 20 per cent or more abroad and your
interest is in reducing volatility, then there is some benefit to hedging.'
But Mr Greenhorn, who now heads an active quant fund management team at
State Street, said increasingly there are reasons to consider the use of
some currency overlay product for portfolio management.
In currency overlay theory, managers attempt to separate out currency from
other investment decisions and then hedge the currency risk as appropriate.
The process is gaining widespread use among American pension fund managers,
who ironically have a lower percentage of non-domestic assets than do their
UK counterparts.
But the product is still far from mainstream in the UK and its appeal is
greatest to those who are already sympathetic to mathematical applications
of fund management theory.
'There are really two investment decisions,' Mr Greenhorn said. 'One is
whether you like the currency and the other is whether you like the market.
And it's unlikely that your preferred currency is also going to be your
preferred market,' he said.
Moreover, fund managers may not realise just how exposed they are to certain
currencies. Many companies whose shares are held will themselves derive a
significant portion of their revenues from, say, the US or Japan, and buying
that share is furthering that exposure.
Mr Robert Clarkson, general manager of investment at Scottish Mutual, said
that he has been using a currency overlay system for that reason, among
others. The strategy makes significant use of currency derivatives, he said.
'We regard the currency decision as different from the underlying market,'
he said. For instance, while the Japanese stock market currently looks
attractive, the yen is less so. 'We would have a lower yen exposure through
the forward currency market,' he said.
Scottish Mutual also uses derivatives to move quickly into a market where
the stock selection process has not yet been completed. He purchases forward
contracts and then as underlying stocks are purchased, unwinds the position.
However, pension schemes have been chary of such techniques because of the
dim view that the Inland Revenue takes of those activities. While investment
is tax-free, trading is not and gains on those strategies could well attract
capital gains tax.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Switzerland (12): New casino lure for life's
high-rollers - Change in gambling laws brings further attraction for wealthy
international tourists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MCKAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Fedor Dostoevsky was forced to pawn his watch in Geneva in August,
1863, after a run of bad luck on the gaming tables, and returned to Russia
to relate his experiences in a novel, The Gambler, the Swiss city enjoyed a
small reputation for decadence and intrigue.
It is no longer a wild town, but does play host to many international
organisations, including the European headquarters of the United Nations, so
at least the intrigue has survived.
Ten years after Dostoevsky's retreat to St Petersburg, casinos were banned
under the Swiss Constitution and the citizenry returned to its Calvinist way
of life, largely free of moral contamination from Europe's dissolute
aristocracy, travelling the social axes of Paris, Baden-Baden, and southern
Europe.
On March 7 this year the Swiss had a change of heart. They voted in a
referendum for the roulette wheels to spin again and for the return of
life's high-rollers.
It was no coincidence that one of the main lobby groups, which campaigned
for a law change, was the Swiss Tourist Federation, representing the
interests of 650 tourism enterprises and local authorities. During the past
10 years the average number of overnight stays in Swiss hotels has
stagnated. Any traces of complacency in the industry disappeared earlier
this year after 1992's overnight stays declined 3.2 per cent.
Switzerland's gross income from tourism last year was SFr21.4bn (Pounds
9.5bn) compared with SFr20.8bn in 1991. Due to price rises, the increase in
income did not reflect the decline in bookings. Tourism is the country's
third-largest contributor to the balance of payments, after engineering and
chemicals. About 208,000 people are directly employed in the sector,
amounting to 7 per cent of the workforce.
Compared to Austria and France, Switzerland remains an expensive proposition
for Europe's recession-hit tourists. One of the few areas of real growth
have been camping, caravaning and youth hostels, where reasonable prices
have been maintained. Unlike Austria, Switzerland may not easily attract the
newly-affluent citizens of former communist countries, such as Hungary.
The Swiss tourist industry is driven by quality and price, rather than
scale. Prior to the outbreak of the First World War, there were 211,000
hotel beds in the country. Last year this figure was 267,000, so the number
has not changed significantly in 80 years. While neighbouring countries race
ahead in mass-market tourism, resorts in Switzerland are continually looking
for improvements in quality.
THE casino legislation is regarded, therefore, as another small addition to
the country's formidable tourist assets of Alpine beauty, lakeside
tranquillity and world-class service and efficiency.
The Swiss Tourist Federation's spokeswoman, Ms Elizabeth Kaufmann, explained
the reasoning behind the casinos campaign - 'we exist as a lobby group for
the industry and we had been making representations at federal level for a
change in the law for years, because that is what our members wanted.'
As Switzerland is still perceived as the main European playground of the
wealthy, there was some logic in the tourist federation's use in its
campaign of the Swiss proverb - 'if money is growing in the streets, you
only have to bend down to gather it in.'
Casinos already exist in most Swiss cities and resorts as the ban was eased
in 1956. But the maximum stake allowed is SFr5, less than the price of a
beer in a Swiss hotel. Because of this, wealthy tourists seeking the thrill
of the green baize have to make cross-border raids to take advantage of the
many casinos specially built near Switzerland's frontiers by its neighbours.
Indeed, Swiss themselves are not averse to driving across the border for a
flutter.
One sore point for the industry is that the government's support for the
re-opening of real casinos was bolstered by its intention to take 80 per
cent of gross revenues. A debate is still continuing over how the extra
funds will be spent. The tourist federation would like some money set aside
for tourism promotion and investment, while the government favours social
spending perhaps to appease religious groups and others opposed to casinos.
IN St Moritz, the centre of the country's most successful tourist area, the
Grisons, there was jubilation at the outcome of the casino referendum.
Deputy tourist director for the resort, Mrs Anne-Marie Meyer, says St Moritz
and neighbouring villages voted heavily in favour for what is regards as an
important improvement in facilities. Hotel occupancy was only 65 per cent in
March, and St Moritz, with its Cresta Run toboggan ride and horse racing on
ice, has obvious attractions for the sporting tourist.
Only a maximum of seven licences are expected to be granted nationwide, and
there will be fierce competition among the resorts and cities to be awarded
one. Mrs Meyer was confident of the prospects for St Moritz - 'we definitely
want a real casino here and I'm sure we'll get one. But the whole process of
changing cantonal law could mean a delay of more than two years before it
can be opened.'
St Moritz and other Swiss resorts are unlikely to see a surge in business
this year. A survey by the Union Bank of Switzerland, says hotels are
prepared for the general downward trend in overnights to continue. Roughly
25 per cent of hoteliers forecast falls in sales and earnings.
Germans were the most numerous foreign visitors last year, followed by
Britons and Americans, then Italians and French.
When the casinos open after the mid-1990s the government will be determined
to keep a close check on the clientele to make sure the establishments do
not become another Swiss institution upon which the world's money-launderers
can test their ingenuity. Switzerland's new-found sensitivity about the
wages of crime would please even Dostoevsky.
Should the casinos attract the wrong sort of tourist, however, the
authorities would have no hesitation in turning back the clock with a call
of rien ne va plus ('no more bets').

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Switzerland (13): Geneva - a centre of precision
manufacturing / The city is home for one of Switzerland's largest machine
tool companies, Charmilles Technologies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN one thinks of Geneva, manufacturing is not something that comes
immediately to mind.
Yet the city is a significant centre of precision manufacturing, especially
of up-market watches, but of other products as well.
It is home, for example, to one of Switzerland's largest machine tool
companies, Charmilles Technologies.
Charmilles, like the Geneva watchmakers, may be a rather small company by
international standards - sales last year reached SFr314m - but it is a
global leader in a niche market.
Its niche is electro-deposition (spark erosion) machines. EDM technology is
of fairly recent vintage, having been discovered by accident by two Soviet
engineers in 1943.
The attraction of this technology was that it permitted cutting metal in
unusual shapes while maintaining a high level of precision. As such, it was
an appropriate replacement for milling machines in some applications,
notably die sinking.
Industrial production of EDM machines was started by a UK company in 1952
but, as in so many other cases, that company has long since disappeared.
Charmilles, then part of the Ateliers Charmilles industrial conglomerate,
began in the mid 1950s and soon established itself as the leading world
supplier.
Like its watchmaking neighbours, it concentrated for a long time on making
the most sophisticated machines, priding itself on its precision technology.
However, in recent years, again like its watchmaking neighbours, it found
itself being undercut by Japanese competitors making simpler but cost
effective machines in high volume.
As Japan's mass consumer product industries became stronger, they too became
interested in EDM, prompting such local machine tool makers as Makino and
Hitachi Seiki to enter the fray in the 1960s.
Initially, Charmilles did not pay much attention. It continued to win sales
in Japan for its sophisticated machines, and both the company and its agent
were content to play the low volume, high margin game.
However, it gradually became apparent that customers introduced to EDM
technology on Japanese machines would continue buying Japanese machines as
they became more demanding rather than switch to Charmilles.
'Now the technological gap is much smaller, so we cannot maintain our stance
of concentrating at the top end,' says Andre Richoz, president.
The other shock for Charmilles in recent years was to realise that Japan had
become the most important market for EDM machines.
But today, Japan represents a third of the world market for EDM machines,
and Charmilles has only a tiny share there. Only three per cent of the
machines it makes go to Japan. In other markets too, Charmilles has found
itself squeezed by Japanese competitors who now account for 42 per cent of
world output compared to 15 per cent made in Switzerland.
Mr Richoz, who was hired away from the Swiss engineering group Sulzer three
years ago to lead Charmilles, has set about trying to improve the group's
position.
'We cannot be strong in the world without having a significant position in
the Japanese market,' he says.
A subsidiary has been set up in Tokyo and the group is designing products
and training programmes specially for the Japanese market. Although the
company makes its own numerical controls, it has adopted Fanuc controls for
its products in Japan because Japanese engineers are accustomed to them.
'We do not expect to make money there quickly. Our objective is to have an
exposure to the toughest competition,' Mr Richoz says.
Charmilles, now part of the Georg Fischer engineering group, has not escaped
the ravages of the recession. Precise figures are not revealed, but
officials say that after a handsome profit in 1990, the company tumbled into
loss in 1991. Last year, its result improved but were still termed
'unsatisfactory'.
Employment at the company's factory in the Geneva suburb of Satigny has been
cut from 720 to 650, but is now considered to be at a stable level.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Switzerland (14): City widens its horizons - Tax
incentives for new businesses have been agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT so long ago, Geneva, like most cities in Switzerland, turned up its nose
at the notion of industrial promotion. Jobs were plentiful and more
businesses wanted to come to the city than there was space for, writes Ian
Rodger.
Would-be newcomers were invited to locate in industrial and technology parks
that were springing up in neighbouring communities across the French border.
Work permits were severely rationed.
But times have changed. Following a speculative property boom in the mid
1980s, the canton of Geneva was particularly hard-hit by the early 1990s
slump. It has an unemployment rate of six per cent, with 12,500 people out
of work.
Geneva's leaders have been quicker than most of their Swiss cousins in
joining the rough and tumble international competition among governments to
lure new jobs.
Two years ago, the cantonal government decided to develop an industrial
promotion policy, but it took some time to convince people of the need - 'it
was difficult to wake up. We had it so easy for so long,' says Mr Robert
Kuster, head of economic promotion.
Whereas it used to take months to get approval for work permits for
businessmen, it can now be done in less than a week. Even tax incentives for
new businesses have been agreed.
The canton's promotion campaign is based on Geneva's status as an
international centre and on the quality of life in its region.
The main focus has been on international companies wanting to establish
European headquarters. Geneva already has a fair stock of these, notably Du
Pont de Nemours and Hewlett Packard.
The other targets are international organisations. The city has long been an
important centre for the United Nations, with 15 UN organisations based
there. Competition among cities to attract UN agencies has become more
intense in recent years and self-satisfied Geneva was slow to respond. Last
year, it lost the battles for the secretariat to administer the UN treaty
outlawing chemical weapons and for the Commission on Sustainable
Development, arising out of the Rio de Janeiro environment conference.
It is spending SFr60m to turn Palais Wilson, the former home of the League
of Nations, into a House of the Environment, aiming to attract various UN
and non-governmental organisations, (NGOs).
The financial community is doing its bit. Last August, it set up Fondation
Place Financiere to promote Geneva's standing as a European financial
centre. And last month it convinced the European Federation of Financial
Analysts to set up its new institute in Geneva.
At the outset, only two new jobs will be created but, coming at a time when
Geneva's bourse is preparing to close in favour of a national electronic
exchange, it is welcome.
'It's a first step,' says Mr Thierry Lombard, a partner in the private bank
Lombard, Odier and chairman of the Fondation Place Financiere. 'But now we
have to develop it. I will be happy in three years time when there are signs
that European competence in this area is catching up with the Americans.'

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (10): Few signs of a
return to favour - Property / institutions are still fighting shy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK commercial property market may be approaching the bottom of its
cycle, but pension funds are not enthusiastic about returning to it.
Although lower interest rates and the devaluation of sterling last September
prompted a flicker of interest in commercial property from overseas
investors and private buyers, the institutions have largely stayed on the
sidelines.
According to the Central Statistical Office, institutional investment in UK
commercial property totalled Pounds 937m last year, less than half the
previous year's Pounds 1.95bn. In the last quarter of the year insurance
companies and pension funds made net sales of Pounds 77m of property.
Within the institutional sector, pension funds are markedly less
enthusiastic than insurance companies about property investment, according
to a Gallup poll for CSW, a property magazine, at the start of this year.
Some 31 per cent of pension funds expected to disinvest from commercial
property, compared to 23 per cent of pension funds which expected to invest.
The comparable figures for insurance companies were 53 per cent and 12 per
cent.
The pension funds' low level of interest in property investment cannot
simply be ascribed to a belief that property will continue to fall in value.
More than half the pension funds polled by Gallup thought that a meaningful
recovery in UK property would take place in the first half of 1994; 38 per
cent thought the second half of 1994.
Indeed, even bearish commentators concede that the case for buying property
has improved. Property yields, which average around 10 per cent, are higher
than gilt yields for the first time since the 1960s. The banks' reluctance
to make new property loans has severely limited the prospects for new
property development. That means that when demand from tenants eventually
returns to the market, rents can be expected to rise.
The result has been reasonably strong demand for high yielding property with
financially secure tenants, the income of which more than covers their
financing costs. Retail warehouses, distribution warehouses and industrial
sheds are most in demand from institutions, according to a survey by the
Corporate Intelligence Group.
However, the general lack of enthusiasm by pension funds for most of the
commercial property sector is unlikely to be rapidly reversed.
For one thing, several of the traditional selling-points of property have
been undermined in recent years. The standard institutional lease, with its
25-year duration and upward-only rent reviews, has come under pressure from
tenants demanding concessions and incentives.
For another, the belief that property added counter-cyclicality and
stability to an investment portfolio has been found wanting in the present
downturn.
Another traditional attraction of property, its role in hedging against
inflation, has diminished in its perceived importance as prices have come
under control, although a resurgence in inflation over the next few years
might renew its appeal.
Another explanation of why property is out of favour is that its performance
over the past decade has been extremely poor. The annual rate of return for
direct property over 10 years, five years and one year was 7.7 per cent, 6.2
per cent and -0.1 per cent, respectively, compared with 18.8 per cent, 14.7
per cent and 20 per cent for the FTA All Share index or 11.6 per cent, 10.6
per cent and 15.4 per cent for gilts.
Furthermore, pension funds' cash flow is being squeezed which is limiting
their ability to invest. In bidding for investment funds, property is having
to compete with other asset classes. The government's burgeoning borrowing
requirement will make institutions heavy buyers of gilts, limiting their
appetite for non-gilt assets.
That said, tax changes reduced pension fund's dividend income from equities
by 6.2 per cent, which may lead them to switch some of their holdings into
higher yielding assets such as gilts and direct property.
Another factor militating against property investment is that the proportion
of property in some portfolios has shrunk to a point where it may be more
trouble than it is worth.
Property's underperformance during the 1980s, together with the funds'
ability to spread their investments into overseas equities after exchange
controls were lifted in 1979, limited the role of property to institutions.
The average weighting of property in pension funds valued between Pounds
100m and Pounds 1bn fell from more than 13 per cent in 1980 to 4 per cent in
1991, according to the WM company.
Property's role is particularly inconspicuous in smaller funds. Pension
funds with under Pounds 100m in management have less than 2 per cent of
their assets in property, while funds of more than Pounds 1bn have a
weighting of more than 10 per cent. But even though small funds are put off
by property's illiquidity, management costs and the relatively large number
of properties needed to obtain sufficient diversification, their property
funds have outperformed their larger rivals, according to recent research by
Gerald Eve, chartered surveyor, and Investment Property Databank.
The annualised mean total return of small funds, with less than Pounds 65m
of property, was 11.88 per cent and 10.4 per cent over five and 10 years
respectively. For large funds, the return was 10.59 per cent and 9.53 per
cent respectively.
The most likely reason for this is that large funds had a greater exposure
to property development and avoided City offices because of their large lot
sizes. They also benefited because their retail investments were mainly in
standard shops rather than shopping centres. 'Any economies of scale which
large funds possess appear to be more than offset by the small funds'
greater agility,' said Mr Eve.
The large variations in the performance of different funds underline the
scope for bucking the trend by making shrewd purchases.
The minority of funds that are buying commercial property may do well from
investing at a time of low expectations and little competition. For the
present, however, commercial property shows few signs of returning to
favour.

AFTER a year in which classic UK fund managers wildly outperformed the basic
stock index, it has become fashionable to question the future of
index-matching as a technique.
'Is Indexation Dead' is the subject of a recent seminar offered by County
NatWest Investment Management which has between Pounds 6bn and Pounds 7bn
under management in so-called indexed funds. Mr Rick Lacaille, associate
director of CNWIM, said that a widely-publicised set of figures from the
pension fund industry performance measurement services are partly to blame.
Combined Actuarial Performance Services (CAPS) found that the average
'active' manager outperformed the FT-A Actuaries All Share Index by 1.8
percentage points, returning 22.4 per cent on a UK equities portfolio
against a return of 20.6 on the FT-A. Similarly, WM Company, whose universe
includes more of Britain's larger pension funds who actually use indexation,
also found outperformance but by a much smaller margin.
Indeed, the CAPS figures show, active managers outperformed passive
'index-tracking' managers in two out of the last three years. In a market
which has never been hospitable towards mathematical approaches to fund
management, do the latest figures sound the death knell for passive
quantitative management?
Mr John Clamp, chief executive of CAPS, asks: 'Is indexation dead? I don't
think so by any measure.' CAPS data over the past 10 years, for instance,
showed that UK active fund managers, on average, simply equalled the FT-A.
Between active and passive managers, there is little difference in return
while passive managers offer the advantage of far lower fees. While the
active managers of balanced pools may charge 15 to 30 basis points of funds
under management, passive index managers charge no more than five.
Ironically, it has been the poor performance of active managers over the
past 10 years which has driven pension fund clients to consider passive
quantitative fund management at all. Mr Andrew Threadgold, former chief
executive at PosTel, the UK's largest pension fund which runs 60 per cent of
its Pounds 20bn in funds in a passive manner, said that the scheme was
driven to choose passive quantitative fund management by poor performance in
the late 1970s.
But overall, unlike the US, where quant has been a mainstream approach for
nearly 20 years, the pension fund market has been slow to follow. The staple
'quant' product has been an index-tracking mechanism in which the fund
manager builds a portfolio with all the equities in a given index in
proportion to each share's weighting in the index.
Mr Clamp estimates roughly 5 per cent of the UK pension fund market is
managed using index-tracking techniques against about 14 per cent in the US.
The largest index-tracking fund management firm in the UK is Barclays de
Zoete Wedd which has won a number of well-publicised mandates in the past
year.
However, the area of quantitative fund management earning the most interest
in the industry is not passive indexation but a style of management which
loosely falls under the rubric of active quantitative fund management.
And, while many of those firms offering the product are the same as those
who pioneered passive quantitative technique, the two are in fact worlds
apart. Quite simply, it is the marriage of analysis by traditional fund
managers with the computer technology of indexers. 'We try to replicate with
a computer what a traditional fund manager would do by hand,' says Mr Kevin
Rowe, partner at Buchanan Partners, an active quant boutique which
specialises in the use of equity derivatives. 'The difference is risk
control.'
Mr Peter Lockyer, partner at consulting actuaries Clay and Partners, says
that the market for active quant services has broadened significantly. While
there remains limited appetite for discrete products managed in that fashion
 -probably no more than Pounds 5bn is managed in this fashion in all of
Britain - the mainstream active fund managers are quietly incorporating the
approach into their own stock selection and asset allocation process.
Indeed, Mr Andrew Rudd, chief executive of Barra Inc, the largest database
provider for both active and passive quant fund managers, says that 18 of
the 20 largest fund managers in London are using his products. Among other
things, quant methodology can be used to check for unintended bias in the
construction of a portfolio such as an overweighting in small companies, he
said. Thus, the extent to which quant applications are gaining currency is
far larger than the funds under management suggest.
The basic active quant product involves the use of Tactical Asset Allocation
(TAA). According to Clay and Partners, this involves establishing benchmarks
showing how a fund's assets would be allocated among different asset classes
when all classes are priced fairly to each other. If mispricings occur, then
value can be added by making a tactical decision to move away from the
benchmark.
Similarly, firms are also offering stock selection products which require
breaking down components of a company's performance and isolating those
characteristics deemed most likely to emerge in stocks which outperform.
Managers may offer TAA, a stock selection product or some combination of the
two. Often the product includes a currency overlay intended to reduce the
risks from fluctuations.
While quant firms differ from each other in the system they use for stock
selection and the variables they focus on, most use some value-oriented
approach. What can make the difference between the success or failure of a
strategy is little more than the ability to pick the right variables.
But Mr Lockyer, whose firm has conducted an analysis of the relative
performance of several active quant managers, says that the problem is that
market conditions are subject to change. The variable which helped to pick
stocks in one cycle may become irrelevant in another. 'One of the points
about quant is that the world changes and then you have to re-think your
whole strategy.'
Moreover, many quant managers suffered from the absence of an actual
investment track record. Many have produced sales tools which hypothecate
how the fund would have performed over the previous five years. 'The truth
is that backtesting doesn't work,' Mr Lockyer said. 'Everyone's backtest
shows spectacular results.'
One firm which has successfully attracted clients is Hill Samuel Asset
Management which has been running a discrete product for five years and has
been able to outperform the FT-A in each of those years. However, five key
staff have recently defected to State Street where they plan to offer a
similar product and prospective clients may question the applicability of
the track record to present conditions.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Switzerland (9): Military debate intensifies - The
forthcoming 'Fortress Switzerland' referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MCKAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE item of Swiss military hardware best known throughout the world is the
Swiss Army knife. In Switzerland itself, the piece of hardware pre-occupying
minds is the US McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 fighter aircraft.
The knife, turned into a consumer item after it became popular with Allied
troops serving along the Swiss border during the Second World War, may evoke
images of benign Alpine soldiers whittling wood or popping corks around camp
fires, but in reality the country at the centre of western Europe is one of
the most militarised in the world, in pursuit of its policy of heavily-armed
neutrality.
However, this cornerstone of the Swiss confederation is now under increasing
threat as the younger generations question the country's military doctrine
in the post-Cold War world.
Swiss voters go to the polls next month in a referendum to challenge again
the idea of 'Fortress Switzerland.' A combination of the end of the Soviet
threat and continuing economic recession helped gather enough popular
support in a nationwide petition last year for the holding of a vote on June
6 to block a SFr3.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) government deal to buy 34 F/A-18
aircraft.
Government proposals for a restructuring of the citizens' militia in 1995
have not been enough to silence critics of high military spending at a time
of greatly reduced threat.
While Switzerland's security has depended for decades on its ability to
mobilise its militia army of 625,000 men, a group of Social Democrats and
pacifists claimed to have mobilised more than 500,000 people - 11 per cent
of the electorate - in just 34 days to sign the petition calling for a
moratorium on buying the fighter aircraft. In the event, only 100,000
signatures needed to be verified for the referendum to go ahead.
Under Switzerland's system of direct democracy, any private citizen can
challenge government policy by gathering the support of 100,000 voters for
what is termed a 'people's initiative'. Next month's ballot will also decide
on a side issue, with the pacifist lobby seeking a limit of 40 on the number
of army bases in the country.
What has alarmed the defence ministry in Bern is not only the scale of the
opposition to the purchase of the F/A-18, but the fact that the wording of
the referendum - which is decided by the successful petitioners - bans all
new fighter aircraft purchases, from whatever source, until the year 2000.
By that time the Swiss air force would be virtually obsolete.
The country's most modern frontline fighters comprise 130 US F-5s, built in
the 1970s, backed up by 45 French-built Mirage-IIIs from the 1960s. It also
has 130 vintage Hawker Hunters, now 40 years old.
A large 'yes' vote, even falling short of a majority, will confirm a growing
dissatisfaction among the young with the idea of military service and
defence at any cost. A referendum in November 1989, calling for the armed
forces to be scrapped altogether, was defeated. However, 36 per cent of the
electorate voted in favour. In addition to widespread pacifist sentiments,
there is also a growing perception that the military establishment wields
more political clout than is healthy in a democracy such as Switzerland's.
THE defence ministry has attempted to counter the arguments against the
F/A-18 by pointing to the fact that the costs have been spread over seven
years and payments made and falling due have been allowed for in military
spending plans up to 1994.
Defence spending for 1993 will be SFr5.8bn, or 1.5 per cent of GDP, which
represents a 6 per cent reduction on last year. A defence ministry spokesman
said that opponents of the F/A-18 have ignored the fact that the deal
includes privileged access to the US market for Swiss goods up to a value of
SFr2.5bn. A similar agreement was signed with Germany when Switzerland
bought its Leopard battle tanks.
On the timing of the aircraft purchase during recession, the defence
ministry pointed out that as evaluations of an aircraft take up to five
years such a deal cannot be based on short-term economic considerations.
'Every country in Europe, except Austria and Switzerland, has updated its
fighter force for the 21st century. It is a purchase for the long term. We
would expect to have the F/A-18s in service for 30 years.' The defence
ministry spokesman added that the aircraft, which is armed with Sidewinder
heat-seeking missiles, was the best of its generation for Switzerland's
needs and was easily integrated with European forces during the Gulf war.
A cheaper alternative for air defence - ground-to-air missiles such as the
US Patriot system - is not considered capable of protecting all of the
country's air space, because of the limitations of radar guidance in
mountainous terrain.
None of these arguments impress the sponsors of the referendum, gathered
under 'The Group For Switzerland Without An Army.' Their leader is Mr
Andreas Gross, a bearded 41-year-old Social Democrat MP from Zurich. His
party, a member of the ruling four-party coalition, voted against the deal
when it was approved by parliament a year ago.
'It is a political obscenity at a time of more pressing needs and reduced
world tension,' said Mr Gross, who wants the funds redirected into improved
social provisions, low-cost housing and increased aid for the Third World.
He believes a yes result would represent 'a blow against the political
hegemony of the army.' It has 'always received special treatment and has
taken a political stand in many aspects of domestic affairs, including such
issues as the length of the working week. If we receive a yes vote, the
government has a moral duty to remove the funds from the military budget and
spend them elsewhere,' he says.
Even if Mr Gross and his supporters won a majority of the popular vote -
which is increasingly unlikely - they could still lose. The country's
political system is weighted in favour of the cantons. A majority of the 23
individual cantons also would have to vote in favour for a moratorium on the
deal to be brought into effect. Some analysts believe the yes vote would
need to be as high as 60 per cent of the popular vote to secure the majority
of the cantons.
Support for the initiative may also have suffered because of the worsening
of the conflict in Bosnia compared with a year ago when the petition was
presented.
In the meantime, the government continues with its defence review to be
implemented in 1995. The size of the citizens' militia is to be reduced from
625,000 to 400,000 by cutting the age limits under which all Swiss men are
required to undergo three weeks of military training a year.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Switzerland (10): Daunting task in the Balkans -
The Red Cross
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MCKAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Committee of the Red Cross, founded to help the victims of
war and guardian of the Geneva Conventions, is facing one of the biggest
challenges of its 130-year history.
Its effectiveness as the agent of humanity in wartime is being called into
question in the former Yugoslavia in the most serious flouting of the Geneva
Conventions since the Second World War.
The test of the ICRC's legal and moral status on the battlefield - it is
mentioned in the Geneva Conventions and is an observer at the United Nations
 -comes at a time when it is seeking to redefine itself as a more
international body, separate from its host country, Switzerland. At a quiet
ceremony on March 17, the organisation officially severed its links with the
Swiss government.
The move resulted largely from Switzerland's fading neutrality after the
Cold War. Bern's participation in UN sanctions against Iraq and moves
towards closer ties with the European Community precipitated the separation
in the interests of the ICRC's strict rules of independence.
The government will continue, however, to finance a large portion of the
ICRC's running costs.
With some 30 operations in progress throughout the world, the ICRC's budget
for 1993 is currently SFr754.6m (Pounds 336.8m). Of this total, SFr632m is
earmarked for actions in the field such as the Balkans, Angola, Somalia and
the former Soviet Union.
These funds are raised in appeals to signatories of the Geneva Conventions,
national Red Cross societies, and from donations.
Another aspect of the ICRC's aim of becoming more international has been its
decision to end its all-Swiss policy of delegate recruitment. Now candidates
of any nationality can apply for selection as delegates.
However, the top management will remain in Swiss hands. Its main
decision-making body is a 25-member assembly of 'the great and the good'
from the Swiss intellectual and business communities.
They are expected to be sending young aid workers off to the Balkans war
zone on the Zagreb express from Lausanne for some time to come.
The poignancy of a train ride from Switzerland to a war in Europe has not
been lost on the ICRC's headquarters staff.
The organisation was born as the result of an earlier bloody war in Europe.
A Swiss businessman, Henri Dunant, witnessed the suffering of wounded
soldiers in the Franco-Austrian battle of Solferino, in Italy in 1859.
On returning to his home city of Geneva he wrote a book, Memories of
Solferino, in which he recounted the horrors of battle and the inhumanity of
its aftermath.
He proposed the setting up of a war relief agency out of which was born the
ICRC and the Red Cross movement. The Geneva organisation then built up its
reputation throughout the twentieth century and two world wars.
Part of the the ICRC's task has been to help develop international
humanitarian law from which it gets its mandate.
Recent efforts by the ICRC to strengthen its reputation as an impartial
intermediary in wartime has so far failed to add to its influence over
Bosnia's political and military factions, which, with varying degrees of
brutality, have broken formal agreements with the ICRC on the humane
treatment of military and civilian victims.
Repeated appeals for mercy to be shown to defenceless civilians, wounded
combatants and prisoners in Bosnia have been ignored by the warring sides
with a cynicism not witnessed by the humanitarian organisation, even during
the bloody conflict in Afghanistan and some 17 years of civil war in
Lebanon.
Acts of vengeance, indiscriminate attacks on civilians, and the so-called
'ethnic cleansing,' have been carried out on what the organisation describes
as 'a massive scale'.
At its Geneva headquarters, a senior ICRC delegate held up four separate
accords signed by Bosnia's Serb, Moslem and Croat leaders, and in one case
the government in Belgrade, pledging to respect the Geneva Conventions. The
first was signed on May 22 last year, a month after the conflict began, and
all have been broken.
'In Bosnia we have had everything that is contrary to the Geneva
Conventions,' the delegate said, 'massacres of civilians, the disappearance
and execution of prisoners we have visited, rapes, mass arrests,
expropriation of property, destruction of houses, and forced movement of
civilian populations.
HE adds: 'When you have 200 delegates working all over Bosnia trying to
convince everyone, from the highest-ranking to the lowest, saying 'please
behave humanely,' and you see its having no effect - what can you say?'
Comparing the Balkans tragedy with the brutality the ICRC has witnessed in
every conflict since the Second World War, the delegate says: 'There is a
rationality gap in Bosnia that is bigger than anything we saw in Lebanon, or
even Afghanistan.'
One of the difficulties the ICRC has faced in increasing degrees over the
past three or four years has been the politicisation and militarisation of
humanitarian aid.
The UN under Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali has adopted what it calls an 'Agenda
for Peace.' The Egyptian UN chief has ruled that conflict operations must be
integrated in every dimension: military, political and humanitarian.
Where an organisation like the ICRC might find this policy advantageous in
the initial phase of a war, the case of Bosnia suggests the advantages are
only short-term.
A political solution is still some way off and the humanitarian operation
has been a relative failure.
ICRC delegates, along with more than 500 local employees - of all ethnic
groups - are based in 17 areas of the fragmented former communist country.
They are striving to provide protection for civilians by being present in as
many areas as possible. However, their main success to date has been
securing the release of 5,000 prisoners of war.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Switzerland (11): Pressure for farm reforms -
Hefty production-related subsidies to farmers have led to perverse results,
including high food prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE next few months, most Swiss farmers will begin receiving their first
dose of general direct payments from their federal government.
The idea, now widely accepted among agricultural policy-makers throughout
the industrialised world, is to separate the question of farm income from
the question of production.
Switzerland, like most other industrialised countries, has provided farmers
with hefty production subsidies in the postwar period.
Indeed, the country is, according to the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD), the champion in this field, with
production subsidies accounting for no less than 79 per cent of consumer
prices in 1987-88.
These production-related subsidies have led, in Switzerland as elsewhere, to
a number of perverse results. Production has been excessive and the
environment has been damaged by the fertilisers and other chemicals that
have been over-used to intensify output. High product prices coupled with
severe import restrictions have hurt consumers while helping small farm
units - that might otherwise have collapsed - to survive.
For a long time, the Swiss were willing to put up with very high food costs,
still feeling gratitude to farmers for providing adequate supplies of food
during the Second World War. Indeed, the legal basis of farming in the
country is a 1951 law that called for the maintenance of a vigorous peasant
farming community.
However, in recent years, as comparisons with food costs in other countries
have become more unfavourable, attitudes have changed. Many Swiss have voted
with their feet, shopping regularly in neighbouring France and Germany where
prices for meat and dairy products are as much as 50 per cent lower than at
home.
An additional pressure for reform has come from the Uruguay Round of
multilateral trade negotiations which, if it succeeds, would oblige
Switzerland, like other countries, to reduce its subsidies to farmers.
The Swiss government embarked on a big reform programme about two years ago,
with three aims generally agreed. These were to promote larger farm units,
to reduce surpluses and to ease the impact of agriculture on the
environment.
In the typical Swiss way, once there is general agreement on something, the
execution follows remarkably quickly. By last October, a law had been passed
incorporating these principles, and the regulations to implement it cleared
the cabinet two weeks ago.
THANKS to high subsidy levels, Swiss farm units have remained very small -
the average full-time farm was only about 16 hectares in 1990. The
agricultural sector employed about 150,000 people, some 5 per cent of the
labour force, and produced goods worth SFr9.4bn, 4.1 per cent of total GDP.
The initial focus of reform is in dairy products, partly because that is
where the distortions are most pronounced, partly because important cheese
exports could soon be outlawed in many countries unless production subsidies
are cut.
Some SFr190m in direct payments will start to flow in the next few weeks.
Two types of payment are foreseen. The first is in return for the producer
milk price dropping on September 1 from SFr1.07 to SFr0.97 per litre.
The other element is for contributions by farmers to improving the
environment, measures such as returning land to pasture, using biological
techniques and raising free range animals.
Swiss officials hope the rewards for these measures will stop farmers from
thinking only about increasing production.
Amenity is an important element of Swiss agriculture, especially in the
mountains. If farmland is not looked after, the danger of floods and erosion
is enhanced. Also, it becomes less attractive to tourists.
Some Swiss worry that as farmers start to receive their direct payments,
they will simply head for the Seychelles.
The government hopes to stop them by insisting that grassland must be cut at
least once a year if the farmer is to qualify for payments. If the land
reverts to forest - which happens quite quickly if it is neglected - direct
payments are halted.
Direct payments will grow in the future only to partially compensate for
inflation - 'we are telling farmers to cut their costs by 2 per cent a year.
We will raise payments only if inflation is over two per cent,' an
Agriculture Ministry official says.
The hope ultimately is to get milk prices down to levels that are slightly
higher than EC prices, so that products can be exported without subsidies.
In the official's view, this means a price of about SFr0.75 per litre of
milk.
However, the government is not optimistic about the speed with which
production capacity will disappear.
Milk output, for example, has been subject to quotas for several years, and
many farmers have substantial reserve capacity.
At the current milk price, the average farm has 12 cows. Officials estimate
that at SFr0.75 per litre, a farmer will need to have at least 30 cows to be
economically viable.
The government wants to expand the direct payment programme to meats, not
least in the hope of slowing the exodus of consumers to neighbouring
countries. But no moves are scheduled at the moment, largely because of
budgetary restraints and because of the successful campaign by farmers'
organisations to spread out the pain.
Mr Marcel Sandoz, the eloquent president of the Schweizerische Bauernverband
(Swiss Peasant Farmers' Union), says Swiss farmers are among the most
heavily indebted in Europe, having invested heavily in anticipation of
policy stability.
'In farming, the smallest unit of time is one year. It takes a generation to
change the way a farmer thinks, yet we are being asked to adapt to a
revolution in only a few years,' says Mr Sandoz.
Farmers launched a legal appeal for slow implementation of the reform based
on the rather charming Swiss notion that a citizen has the right to trust
his government. The government agreed.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (7): Much easier to give
it all to one manager - Specialisation / Are the days of balanced fund
management over?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE days of balanced fund management are over,' pronounced Tim Gardiner,
partner at consulting actuaries William M. Fraser and Co, at an actuarial
conference last autumn, thus prompting a stormy debate over exactly how
pension assets should be invested.
Mr Gardiner's remarks were aimed at trustees who had failed to try to link
their investment strategy to their liability profile.
The average balanced UK pension fund's 80 per cent weighting in equities may
be inappropriate for very mature schemes with large current pension
obligations and few contributors, he said.
The debate has been misinterpreted by some as being about the relative
merits of bonds and equities. But among pension trustees, it has encouraged
a trend already under way to try to link assets more closely to liabilities.
And that, pensions consultants say, has led them to look at moving away from
balanced management and into specialist funds.
'We will probably see an uptick in specialist mandates due to asset
liability modelling,' said Mr Robert Baker, pensions consultant at William M
Mercer and Co. The most recent data available from the US-based research
firm, Greenwich Associates, suggests that until now, there has been no great
love for specialist fund management in the UK.
At the end of 1991, 51 per cent of UK pension funds surveyed used balanced
managers exclusively, 14 per cent used specialists exclusively, 30 per cent
used both and 5 per cent were managed internally.
If funds over Pounds 1bn are counted, specialists are somewhat more popular,
used exclusively by 25 per cent of funds with only 32 per cent using
balanced management exclusively. Roughly a third use a combination of the
two and 11 per cent are managed internally.
'There are still a lot of trustees locked into balanced management. It's
much easier to give it all to one manager and instruct him to make the asset
allocation decisions for you,' Mr Baker said. 'There is a lot of comfort in
being managed in a pool and having its performance measured against the
average.'
The reluctance of UK pension funds to seek specialist managers is in stark
contrast to the US market where they are the norm. Mr Baker said that while
many factors could account for the differing attitudes, it is helpful to
note the involvement of corporate treasurers in US pension fund operations.
Because they are comfortable with more sophisticated financing techniques,
they are more willing to take on the responsibility of asset allocation and
understand how the use of competing investment styles could add value.
Indeed, the willingness of US schemes to award specialist mandates has
proved to be a boon to a number of Scottish houses including Ivory and Sime,
Murray Johnstone, Martin Currie Fund Managers and Baillie Gifford, who say
they are winning so-called EFEA mandates - mandates to invest in Europe and
the Far East.
But closer to home, interest in specialist fund management has most recently
been aroused by the shifting demographics of pension schemes. Waves of
redundancies at leading UK corporations have dramatically changed the
maturity profile of many pension schemes and some trustees, reviewing recent
actuarial valuations, are having to face some unpleasant truths. 'Once you
start thinking about asset allocation, you begin to think about specialist
management,' said Ms Alison Ramsdale, marketing manager at pension
investment consultants Frank Russell, a US-based firm with expertise in
analysing specialist management.
Ms Ramsdale acknowledges that there has hardly been a headlong rush into
specialist management by UK pension funds. 'Balanced managers have a very
strong grip on the UK pension fund market and they have no interest in
promoting specialist management,' she said. Pension schemes using specialist
managers are typically those of the UK subsidiaries of American companies
such as IBM and Ford.
One UK fund which has is Rolls-Royce. Its investment manager, Mr David
Colclough, says the scheme made the switch in 1986 after careful
consideration and that the asset-liability mismatch was among their initial
concerns.
First, he said, the scheme was achieving poor performance out of the three
balanced managers it was using. Rolls-Royce could not control the overall
asset allocation and as a result, its portfolio had a heavy bias towards
fixed income and property and had missed the very hefty gains on equities.
Also, the fund managers frequently took sector bets which cancelled each
other out, leading to a neutral effect on return and incurring substantial
transactions costs in the process.
Also, Rolls-Royce found that not all balanced managers are good in all
areas. The reporting process for balanced managers allows them to gloss over
their weaknesses because results are reported in total, rather than by asset
category.
Mr Colclough said that in 1986 asset-liability modelling was a relatively
crude affair and that it had not been able to build asset allocation
decisions on then-available systems. But the process has moved light years
ahead recently and with more than 60 per cent of the scheme's members
categorised as current or deferred pensioners, modelling plays a significant
role in asset allocation.
The scheme has 50 per cent of its assets in UK equities, half of that in an
indexed core and 30 per cent of its assets in overseas equities, also split
into an indexed core. The scheme uses 10 foreign managers because it has
found they typically perform better than UK managers do in those markets.
Ms Ramsdale said that Frank Russell's own research shows that in US markets,
local managers do indeed outperform UK managers, although domestic managers
as a rule do not necessarily outperform foreigners. Japan is the only other
country where domestic managers have the distinct edge over foreigners.
But even in their home markets, fund managers report much more interest from
pension funds in their specialist products, particularly 'plain vanilla' UK
equity pools. Mercury Asset Management, for instance, reports that its UK
specialist business is among its fastest growing, having started from almost
nil three years ago.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (8): Decisive factor is
performance - Home or away? Philip Coggan on options for investment managers
</HEADLINE>

DOES it matter where a pension fund manager is based? Can an international
portfolio be managed successfully from London or does the manager need
offices in the countries concerned?
There is one powerful argument in favour of each viewpoint. The London-based
managers would argue distance lends perspective; that they can be more
objective about trends in an overseas market, whereas local managers can be
'carried away' with prevailing bullish or bearish sentiment.
Local managers would retort the London-based managers cannot back up their
claims. Figures from Combined Actuarial Performance Services Limited show
that, if managers matched the indices, they should have achieved a
cumulative return on overseas equities of 16.9 per cent per annum between
1982 and 1991. In fact, they earned just 14.6 per cent per annum over the
period.
The argument from locally-based groups is that only by being in the country
concerned can managers be alive to the trends. Colin Lever, senior partner
at actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow, says: 'My gut feeling is that you do better in
your own market than you do in other people's.
'Property in particular,' he says, 'is something that people think is the
same in other countries as it is in their own.' This, according to Mr Lever,
is where they are led astray. 'British investors have had disasters
investing in Brussels property in the 1970s and in the US in the late 1980s.
The Swedes and the Japanese were buying UK property at inflated prices in
1987-9.'
According to actuaries, there is insufficient statistical evidence to prove
the case one way or the other. Julia Hobart, senior consultant at Mercer
Fraser, says the firm has done some work on this question. 'It is a little
inconclusive but there seems to be some mild evidence that there is merit in
hiring a company which is based locally.'
But, warns Ms Hobart, 'performance may depend on the nature of the local
market, particularly whether small cap stocks are outperforming large-cap
stocks. You would expect the local manager to be better able to pick small
stocks. The local manager is also more likely to outperform in a less
efficient market.'
Gordon J Clark, of actuaries Clay and Partners, says: 'Locally-based
investment managers may be able to trade more efficiently and quickly.
Market timing and use of broker facilities may be evaluated more
effectively.'
These points are underlined as far as the US stock market is concerned by Mr
Jim Conzleman, who is vice-president of Fleming Capital Management in New
York, part of the London-based Robert Fleming group. 'As far as large cap
managers go in the US equity market the London-based manager is not at a
great disadvantage to the locally-based adviser,' he says. 'Broker coverage
is thorough and this is a pretty efficient area of the market.'
But with small company stocks it is different. 'The more companies one can
research first hand and get to know the better off one will be,' Mr
Conzleman says. There are also dealing pitfalls.
'One is better served by having one's own trader acting on the spot than by
leaving open orders from London, only to come in next morning and find that
the deal was put through at the least advantageous price of the day.'
However, Mr Lever warns it might not be sensible to compare the
international manager's performance with the local index. 'If a UK pension
fund invests in Australia, it might well underperform the local index. But
it is probably going to Australia to gain exposure to stocks which are not
available in the UK, particularly natural resources companies. If that part
of the market did badly, you would underperform.'
One UK fund manager says overseas managers have had a good chance to
outperform in Japan. 'Straightforward value techniques have knocked the
pants off the index over the past few years and the index has knocked the
pants off the local managers. Quantitative techniques can easily be applied
outside the country concerned. The more complex the market, the better it is
to be standing at a distance.'
It is a debate which is likely to continue for some years. The question is
inevitably bound up with the issue of whether managers employ a general
manager or specialists for the separate sections of their portfolios. Ms
Hobart says those who follow the specialist route tend to favour local
managers.
Mr Clark says: 'The use of locally-based investment managers necessitates a
strong, centrally-based asset allocation decision-making process. If not,
there is a danger that there is no overall perspective of global relative
market valuation levels.' He adds: 'Thematic approaches arising from the
asset allocation process tend to become blurred through the use of local
managers.'
UK-based managers retain a strong position - indeed they have been quite
successful in marketing themselves to US pension funds as managers for the
global element of portfolios. Overseas fund managers will increasingly come
to the UK to claim their shares of the UK pension fund market.
Meanwhile, UK management companies may well use a global network of offices,
if they have one, as a key selling point in their services. But, says Mr
Lever, 'most trustees would regard the proof of the pudding as in the
eating. The question is: has the network done them any good?' In the end, it
is performance, not rhetoric, which will settle the debate.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (6): Cross-border barriers
remain in force - Europe / Tim Dickson puts the view across the Channel into
perspective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON

<TEXT>
PENSION developments in Europe at the moment can be viewed from two main
perspectives.
One is that of national governments, faced with the nightmare of ever more
expensive social security systems, and desperate to find new ways of
supporting their populations in old age.
The other is that of the European Commission, eager to extend pension
freedoms in the single market but frustrated by different and complex tax
systems and jealously independent member states.
Many barriers to the free movement of EC goods and services were dismantled
by EC directives on January 1 this year, but specific pensions legislation
was a notorious absentee.
As things stand there is a proposed pensions directive before the EC Council
of Ministers - but to the dismay of many practitioners the most ambitious
goal of the man who originally drafted it, the then EC financial services
Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan, is now missing.
The idea of cross-border membership of Community pension schemes has been
shelved for the moment because of the technical and political obstacles to
combining a wide variety of public and private EC systems - among them
advance funding in the UK and the Netherlands, book reserving in German, and
pay-as-you-go in France and the Mediterranean countries.
What remains in the directive are less radical, but not uninteresting,
proposals to allow greater freedom to invest pension fund assets, and to
allow funds to select an investment manager established in another member
state.
The main impact of the latter proposal will be felt in Spain and Portugal,
whose governments insist that pension fund managers must be locally based.
Between them, though, the two remaining pillars of the directive raise the
prospect of multinational company schemes currently administered along
separate national lines being able to pool and centrally manage their assets
in one place (without, of course, attempting to harmonise benefits).
IBM and Digital are on record as looking at this option seriously; Ford is
also studying the options, but is thought to be more cautious.
The obvious attraction of setting up a pan-European common investment fund
(CIF) is lower costs and greater flexibility. But, according to consulting
actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow, tax and other hurdles outweigh the benefits at
the moment. 'The cost savings . . . will not be large enough for many
companies to offset the administration disadvantages, but if a solution is
found to the withholding tax problem the situation could change
dramatically,' says the firm.
For the moment high expectations that liberalisation would bring a rush of
new business for the big London investment firms appear to have been
disappointed. Relatively few big cross-border accounts have been won, and
most managers are reported to be treading over the same relatively narrow
plot of continental ground.
One problem is that continental funds have yet to be persuaded to embrace
the cult of the equity, even if the buying of shares and non-domestic
investments has graduallyincreased in recent years. Actuaries will no doubt
continue to argue that a higher proportion of shares is justified to offset
the risks of inflation - and that superior investment returns can
substantially reduce contribution costs for companies - but the prize for
investment managers should not be exaggerated.
The EC directive when it comes into force in the mid 1990s should limit the
ability of the Belgians and the Danes to restrict investment to certain
asset classes (measures, incidentally, largely aimed at financing these
countries' large budget deficits). Its effectiveness, though, is still
unclear. On top of the prudential controls already introduced into the draft
directive in the wake of the Maxwell scandal, liberals fear that a further
amendment may allow member states to fix maximum limits on specified asset
categories. This might channel pension fund money back into bonds, once
again serving narrow national interests. As the directive stands,
governments will in any case be able to require that 60 per cent of the
assets of a scheme are matched with the domestic currency or Ecus.
If the freedom of investment managers is perhaps the biggest issue of the
moment, pension professionals like Richard Abramson, head of corporate
pensions at Ernst &amp; Young, have not given up completely on aspects of
cross-border membership. In the wake of last year's discussion document
published by the EC Commission, for example, he says there is still some
hope that the something can be done to allow mobile workers to remain in
their existing pension schemes without suffering any adverse tax
consequences. At present, for example, an employee sent by his company from
the UK to Germany will have to pay tax on pension contributions paid into a
UK fund.
Not for the first time reform is strongly championed by the UK, but meets
with a lukewarm response at best from other member states.
One reason is their fear of losing revenue which might help support social
security systems groaning under new demographic pressures. Most European
countries face the same dilemma: increase contributions (ie taxes) to
finance the rising cost of state pensions, or reduce benefits. Both are
politically unpalatable, which is why there are tentative moves by several
governments to encourage more private sector participation.
The issue, for example, is certainly on the agenda of the new French
government. Its predecessor laid out the options in a White Paper two years
ago: though there were no recommendations for action a start has been made
by allowing modest tax incentives for personal pension plans (the so-called
Plans Epargne de Retrait).
Interest is also focused on Austria where 50 per cent of pension liabilities
now have to be pre-funded by companies; Denmark, where companies now have to
make some provision for their blue-collar workers; and Spain, where
pre-funding is also in its infancy and further complicated by the
government's insistence on strong member representation.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Switzerland (8): Tensions on cultural divide -
Languages form a 'Swiss Iron Curtain'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MCKAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE city of Fribourg, with its Medieval cathedral and a historic quarter of
Gothic and Renaissance facades, is one of the main battlegrounds of
Switzerland's Franco-German linguistic rivalry. The division was
dramatically exposed when Switzerland split along language lines and
rejected gradual integration with the rest of Europe in a referendum last
December on membership of the European Economic Area.
A quaint, riverside mixture of architectural treasures and 1960s town
planning, the majority French-speaking Fribourg is no Cold War Berlin.
However, the city does have its own version of the Iron Curtain, knowns as
the Rostigraben - an imaginary trench running through the Swiss psyche and
along the geographical boundary between the some 70 per cent of Swiss who
speak German and the 20 per cent who have French as their mother tongue; in
the south-east of the country, another 9 per cent are Italian speakers and a
tiny minority keeps alive the fourth national language, Romansch.
The Rostigraben takes its name from the fried potato cake of rural origin,
which the Swiss French mischievously perceive as the German-speaking
majority's most imaginative contribution to the country's cuisine.
There is also a natural boundary running through Fribourg, situated about 30
miles south-west of the federal capital, Bern. The River Sarine, known in
German as the Sanne, forms an uneven border between German Switzerland to
the east and the main francophone regions to the west. But it is the
Rostigraben which is referred to by all Swiss when they talk of the cultural
divide.
In recent years, however, the Rostigraben of linguistic separation has
become increasingly symbolic of political divergence as well, with the
largely pro-European Swiss French seeing their desire for a more open
foreign policy, including membership of the United Nations, being crushed by
the inherent conservatism of the Swiss Germans in the rural heartlands.
Fribourg is the capital of the canton by the same name. With the 22 other
mini-states of the Swiss Confederation it enjoys constitutionally-guaranteed
autonomy on all local matters. While Swiss Germans exercise virtual
domination over their francophone co-citizens in such areas as the economy,
the federal public service and the army, the cantonal system allows the
seven cantons with French-speaking majorities, or large and vociferous
minorities, jealously to guard their cultural independence.
In Fribourg, the Swiss Germans are left in no doubt that their status is one
of a minority. Fribourg is two-thirds French-speaking and one-third Swiss
German, almost the reverse of the position nationally. The Fribourg French
are predominantly Roman Catholic and the German-speakers Protestant.
The arrival in recent years of the large Basle-based chemical companies has
provided much-needed employment, but also has brought about demographic
changes as many Swiss Germans have come with them to settle in the area.
While many ordinary Swiss Germans are in general willing to speak French,
the opposite is not the case. The sentiment prevails among French-speakers
that l'allemand n'est pas beau ('German is not a nice language').
The francophone majority in Fribourg has been grudging in its acceptance of
the influx, to such an extent that only in 1991 was German allowed to be an
official language in the canton. The French-speaking majority also reacted
slowly in providing Swiss German, non-Catholic schools, even in areas where
German speakers were in the majority. Many Swiss German families have had to
opt for private education.
While many of the country's multilingual business and intellectual elite
prefer to play down suggestions that Switzerland is anything other than the
spiritual home of ethnic harmony and social cohesion, the political and
cultural gap between ordinary Swiss may be widening.
Professor Ulrich Kloti, a politics lecturer at the University of Zurich,
said Swiss leaders are under-estimating the linguistic divide - 'the man and
the woman in the street feel more serious about this problem. They regard
each other as foreigners if they have a language difference,' he says.
He adds that attitudes of linguistic superiority were not just confined to
the majority French-speaking areas, but also worked in the opposite
direction. 'In the canton of Zurich, when it started to introduce early
French in schools, there was really important opposition. The linguistic
divide is more serious than the authorities would admit.'
The Swiss Franco-German relationship was characterised by Professor William
Ossiepow, lecturer in politics at Geneva University, as one of
'co-existence'. He also believes that the Swiss French have to share the
blame for their under-representation in some centres of power. 'That the
federal government administration is mainly in the hands of German-speaking
people is not entirely their fault. The French-speakers are very reluctant
to speak German because of their own attitude of cultural superiority.'
The battle for hearts and minds of divided Fribourg is conducted by rival
newspapers, the Freiburger Nachrichten and La Liberte. They share the same
offices in the centre of Fribourg but are under separate ownership. Neither
makes language concessions to break down barriers between the canton's
210,000 citizens.
Editor of the Freiburger Nachrichten, Mr Erich Camenzind, has been one of
the main defenders of Swiss German rights in the city.
Years of campaigning by Mr Camenzind and other prominent Swiss Germans
finally bore fruit two years ago when their language was recognised.
Previously court cases involving German-speaking parties were conducted in
French. Ordinary monolingual Swiss Germans also had difficulty dealing with
the local authority. Now the canton is obliged to communicate in both
languages.
However, a campaign by Mr Camenzind and others to make street signs
bilingual in Freiburg (as he calls it) resulted in only limited success. A
compromise was agreed that allowed just 24 streets to have bilingual signs,
but the limit of francophone concessions had been reached. A request to have
bilingual Fribourg-Freiburg signs on the platforms of Fribourg station was
turned down flat.
Cultural and religious divisions in Switzerland have only degenerated into
violence in modern times over one particular region. A car-bomb exploded in
the centre of Berne in January, killing the driver and injuring passers-by.
Police identified the man as a French-speaking nationalist from canton Jura
who had planned to bomb Bern town hall. Raids by police in Jura canton
recovered some 50 grenades and quantities of explosive they said had been
stolen from the army for a renewed Jura nationalist campaign of violence
similar to one in the 1970s.
No other local disputes are likely to lead to violence. Cantonal power is
the safety valve for the ethnic divide in Switzerland.
So long as each canton, particularly in francophone Switzerland, is allowed
to fait sa propre petite cuisine (get on with its own petty affairs) on the
political level, that border trench, the Rostigraben, will never be filled,
in the imagination of the Swiss, with anything more threatening than fried
potato cakes.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Switzerland (6): 'We can give an example to
Europe' - Interview with the president
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IAN RODGER talks to Adolf Ogi, transport minister and this year's president
of the Swiss Confederation.
QUESTION: In spite of the rejection by the Swiss people in a referendum last
December 6 of the government's proposal to join the European Economic Area,
you are maintaining your policy of seeking closer links with the European
Community.
What paths can you follow and what problems will you face?
ANSWER: Our main goals now are to avoid isolation and possible
discrimination arising from our non-participation in the EEA. That means we
must pursue bilateral relations with the EC with a view to concluding
certain agreements.
We are fully aware that we cannot get bilaterally what we have rejected
multilaterally. Nonetheless, we are not going on our knees. We have a range
of assets which are of interest to the EC. For example, they need fast 'just
in time' transportation systems through the Swiss Alps.
I also think we can give an example to the new Europe of how to function if
you accept certain rules. We are a country with four languages, four
cultures and 26 cantons. We know that it is not normal that a country like
ours can live in peace and freedom.
We know that we have to work every day so that this construction,
Confoederatio Helvetica, can go on and become stronger. So we think we have
something to offer to Europe, and that Europe has absolutely no interest in
putting us in a corner.
So far, the EC appears to be proving reluctant to negotiate a bilateral air
agreement. Is there anything Switzerland can do to accelerate the process?
We have a new transit agreement with the EC. Under it, we are going to build
two new tunnels through the Alps which will be beneficial mainly to our EC
neighbours, but we did not ask them for money. (In return, the EC agreed to
negotiate a bilateral air agreement with Switzerland.) We have no doubt that
the EC will honour its commitments.
How soon and under what conditions do you think it would be sensible to seek
the approval of the Swiss people for a renewed approach to joining the EEA
or the EC itself?
We have to be very careful. We do not want to produce another 'No' before
Austria, Sweden and Finland have their referendums on joining the EC.
Referendums have become important signals in Europe. The one in
Liechtenstein - which had a positive result - made the front pages of
newspapers.
So if there is a second try, we must be sure we can get it through. It is
not possible at this time to give a schedule. Things in Europe change so
quickly these days.
The economy could have an influence, what Denmark and Britain do -
everything is interrelated. There is an initiative (petition campaign for a
referendum) under way. If it gets a lot of signatures, that could change the
situation. But it will definitely not be this year.
Has Switzerland's refusal to join the EEA had any concrete impact on the
economy?
We have both positive and negative signs, but it isn't yet possible to
analyse it. And, after all, the EEA isn't yet in force.
Since the EEA rejection, the government has launched initiatives to
liberalise the Swiss economy unilaterally, in particular a so called
Swisslex package of 27 laws. Will these get bogged down or watered down
because of pressures from vested interests?
Our view is that we have to be economically at least as liberalised as the
EC. We had everything going for us for such a long time. Nearly everybody
was rich. When you are rich, you do not work as hard as you should. We
needed a sort of big bang. We did not need a 'No' to the EEA, but it will
wake us up. The government is convinced that if we want to realise the
necessary changes, the package aspect is essential. So far, the various
parliamentary committees have agreed with us.
In a month's time, there will be one referendum on the purchase of new
fighter aircraft for the Swiss airforce and another on how much land should
be made available to the army for training. Do Switzerland's neighbours need
to worry about the country retaining its ability and will to maintain
security at this crossroads of the continent?
We are the only country where the people can vote on such matters. We had a
referendum four years ago on abolishing the army and the great majority
voted in favour of keeping it. Tell me another country that would have had
such a vote and where the people would have voted yes. I am persuaded that
we can win these referendums.
We have a well trained and well equipped army. Under our new policy - Army
95 - we are going to make it smaller, but it will be better. We have
responsible and well brought up young people. Only a very few do not want to
enter the armed services. Do not worry. You will be able to count on
Switzerland in the future to look after security at this crossroads of
Europe.
The EEA vote and the tensions in January and February over the election of a
new member to the Cabinet revealed some strong divisions in internal Swiss
politics. Do you think that the governing coalition will continue to
withstand these strains?
The European issue did not lead to extraordinary strains inside the
government coalition, but the tensions it produced are much deeper than
those during the Cabinet election.
We have differences between the French-speaking part and the German-speaking
part, between old and young, between those who live in towns and those in
the countryside. As president, I have to help get our peoples together
again.
Differing opinions among the four coalition partners are frequent. We have a
very free coalition - there is no written agreement among them - and so we
have no precise government programme. Also, we always have changing
alliances within the governing coalition. Sometimes, where you come from is
more important than your party.
The battle over the Cabinet post arose largely because a woman was proposed
for the vacancy. Are Swiss women going to remain militant?
Yes. We need more women in politics, but I am against quotas. I think it has
to develop normally. You have seen this in cantonal elections in recent
weeks. In Neuchatel, twice as many women candidates were elected.
The Swiss government has been running large deficits in recent years. Are
the Swiss becoming like citizens in other countries, wanting more government
services but not wanting to pay the taxes to finance them?
In my view, the deficit is one of our most important problems, but compared
with our European neighbours, we're still doing fairly well. I think we are
overcoming the situation. It isn't that we are better than others, but we
are still in control of the problem. The deficits are mainly due to the
economic slowdown, but a mentality has developed because we were a bit
spoiled. Now we are taking off our jackets, rolling up our sleeves and going
back to work. But it will take some time before we have a result.

<TEXT>
THE strength of the Swiss stock market and the Swiss franc in the wake of
the negative outcome last December 6 of a referendum on joining the European
Economic Area (EEA) has surprised many analysts.
It was widely predicted in the run-up to the vote that unless Switzerland
joined the EEA, thereby gaining free access to European Community markets,
the country's industries would be hurt badly and its economy would weaken.
That view may yet turn out to be right, but it will take several months, if
not more than a year, for the potential negative impacts of the decision to
become apparent.
In the meantime, however, Switzerland has recovered a role that a year or so
ago it seemed to be irrevocably losing, that of financial safe haven.
Until last summer, the leading European currencies were calm within the
exchange rate mechanism and the path to monetary union looked clear and
relatively smooth.
Now not only the monetary but also the political future of the EC is looking
uncertain, whereas Switzerland's course is, at least for the medium term,
clear. It may not be a brilliant one economically, but it is safe, and it is
a truism that investors prefer safety to uncertainty.
Thus, money has poured into the country in recent months, helping the banks
to improve their recession-damaged profit and loss accounts, and enabling
the central bank to drive down interest rates without having to worry about
a serious weakening of the franc.
Another factor adding to the buoyancy of Finanzplatz Schweiz is the speed
with which the financial industry has sorted out some difficult structural
problems.
In particular, the takeover of the troubled Swiss Volksbank by CS Holding,
the group built around Credit Suisse, has resolved a nagging uncertainty
about the future of structure of retail banking in the country.
Long before the acquisition, it was clear that big changes were necessary in
this overcrowded sector. In addition to four universal banks, Switzerland
has 28 public sector cantonal banks, nearly 200 regional banks and over
1,100 outlets of the Raiffeisen network of co-operative banks all competing
for the small customer's business.
In the boom of the late 1980s, banks of all kinds and sizes lent too much
money to small businesses and property speculators. When the economy slumped
they were hit hard by bad debts and higher costs of refinancing loans. In
late 1991, to the shock of the Swiss themselves, one regional bank, Spar und
Leihkasse Thun, went bust leaving depositors in the lurch.
Since then, safety nets have been strengthened and, to the banking
community's relief, 21 regional banks and 27 Raiffeisen closed last year
without any depositor losses.
But these were relatively minor events compared with the uncertainty over
what was happening on the commanding heights of the sector. Was Credit
Suisse big enough to compete in retail banking with the other two big banks,
Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation? And what would become
of Volksbank, its capital draining away rapidly to cover bad debts?
The takeover of Volksbank by CS solved both issues at once, putting the CS
group on a roughly equal footing with the other big banks with a more than
adequate national branch network and customer base. As Mr Silvio de
Capitani, chairman of the Federal Banking Commission, said last month, 'The
important positions are now taken up in the retail banking sector. It is
very unlikely, at least in the medium term, that any financial groups not
already active in this sector or any foreign competitors will play an
important role in this market.'
Mr de Capitani did not mean that the sector would become soft and
inefficient again. On the contrary - 'we must expect a new intensification
of competition among all the banks concerned,' he predicted. 'Structural
change will certainly continue, and not only in the regional bank sector.
There will be mergers, takeovers and co-operation agreements.'
Indeed, but from here on, the pattern is clearer. The mergers and takeovers
will be largely among the regional banks, as they grope for a formula that
will enable them to counter the economies of scale that the big banks can
offer.
The cantonal banks are trying to achieve the same end mainly through
co-operation agreements. Mergers are largely excluded because each enjoys at
least some measure of guarantee from its cantonal government, although a big
merger of two Geneva based cantonal banks is due to take place later this
year.
The cantonal banks have already pooled their efforts in a number of areas,
including data processing, pension fund management and credit cards, and
other plans are in the works. While many big strategic decisions have been
made, it has to be said that the mostly painful implementation process still
lies ahead. CS alone is looking to close at least 100 of its combined 400
branches and shed 2,000 jobs.
And while the industry welcomed the reduction or elimination of stamp duties
and turnover taxes on some securities transactions that came into effect on
April 1, leading bankers know they must continue to fight for further
legislative and regulatory reform to make the financial centre fully
competitive.
Stamp duties still apply on more than three quarters of securities
transactions. In one category - the purchase by a foreign investor of Swiss
shares on a Swiss stock exchange - the duties apply where they did not exist
before.
The other area where reform is urgent is in investment trust law. Much of
this business in recent years has gone to Luxembourg because of excessive
restrictions and unfavourable tax treatment in Switzerland. A draft reform
has been agreed by interested parties and is expected to be presented to
parliament in either September or December.
The industry's other priority is rationalising its securities markets. The
aim to create a single national stock exchange to replace the three
remaining ones in Zurich, Geneva and Basle has been tied to a plan to build
an infrastructure for electronic trading and settlement. An initial design
for an electronic trading system was abandoned last year after much
bickering by member banks about its cost. A more modest one is now being
developed with a view to beginning operations in 1995.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (5): Foreigners find
favour - Japan / Wayne Aponte sees the industry look abroad
</HEADLINE>

THE Japanese pension fund industry remains only partly open to international
fund managers, who have struggled to compete with Japanese managers and
their networks of corporate and public sector relationships
Even after three years of financial reform and in spite of the huge sums
that must be managed in Japan, few foreigners have made money in the pension
fund business.
But there are shifts in the market. Japan Securities Dealers Employees
Pension Fund, which manages Y330bn, hired recently Frank Russell Japan, a
subsidiary of the US performance evaluation company, to select foreign money
managers.
The fund then selected Invesco MIM Asset management, Baring International
Investment Management and JP Morgan Trust Bank to administer 9 per cent, or
Y2.5bn each, of its new fund starting this fiscal year.
All Japan Surveying Enterprises Combined Employers Pension Fund, which
manages Y52bn, hired Wyatt, a US consulting firm. After extensive meetings,
the fund subsequently decided to turn over Y1bn to Capital International KK,
a subsidiary of Capital Group in the US, from this month.
These accounts are thin when compared to the nation's more than 1,500 funds
totalling about Y25,000bn of employee pension assets in the last financial
year. They represent, however, the first time Japanese pension funds have
used money-management consultants to choose companies. Foreign advisers are
confident that these will hardly be the last cases.
Japan's corporate pension fund market has always been dominated by trust
banks and life insurance companies. Investment advisory companies gained
remarkably limited access to the management of corporate pension funds
during April 1990, when the law was eased. The reforms allowed foreign
advisers to manage employee pension funds, but only new money at least eight
years old.
About 143 officially-approved advisory companies were allowed into the
business, 38 of which were foreign. According to the Japan Securities
Investment Association, these advisory management companies administered
only about 1.1 per cent of all funds at the fiscal year-end in March.
The vast majority of accounts won by foreign advisers have been mostly from
the government. The more lucrative pension fund accounts at private Japanese
corporations generally have gone to domestic fund managers at banks linked
to the company.
Potentially enormous opportunities await the foreign manager, but access to
funds will remain limited by government regulations and the strategic ties
between companies and financial institutions.
By 2010 about 18 per cent of the Japanese workforce is projected to be 65 or
older, compared to only 11 per cent in 1990. Coupled with this increase in
the nation's ageing society, is a substantial growth in the sum total of the
nation's pension fund assets, expected to climb to Y250,000bn by the year
2000, from Y150,000bn in 1990, according to the Pension Fund Association.
But the freedom of investment choice is limited. Japanese companies must
place at least 50 per cent of their assets in fixed income instruments, up
to 30 per cent in foreign-currency assets, 30 per cent in stocks and 20 per
cent in real estate.
Pension funds are accounted on book value, the amount paid for them, rather
then their market value. Also, domestic fund managers are expected to reach
a set realised rate of return each year at 5.5 per cent.
Mr Tak Wakasugi, professor of finance at the University of Tokyo and
co-director of the University of Michigan's Mitsui Life Financial Research
Center, said Japan's pension fund system rewards the fund manager who takes
the least amount of risk. He added that changes in these regulations are
necessary for the investment behaviour of fund managers to change.
'Under the present regulations, fund managers cannot move,' said Mr
Wakasugi, who chaired a recent committee sponsored by the ministry of
finance on investment performance evaluation. The committee conducted an
18-month study that ended last year.
The drive to measure the nation's pension funds by their performance is
currently in a deadlock, said Mr Wakasugi, because the participants in the
industry fail to agree on how to implement the tool. Even an immediate
adoption of performance evaluation will hardly liberalise the pension fund
industry. 'The change of one factor will not be enough,' Mr Wakasugi added.
The decline of Tokyo's stock market from its peak of 38,915 in 1989 to its
six-year low of about 14,309 last August pressurised the pension fund
managers, and resulted in capital losses on the portfolios of institutional
investors. However, in recent weeks, equity trading on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange has rallied about 20 per cent from the beginning of this calendar
year. Government fund buying through public funds fuelled the advance in
March. Stock market analysts expect the advance to continue into the summer,
when early signs of an economic recovery are expected. This direction will
be followed by profit-taking before the end of the calendar year.
The fund of Y1,900bn run by the Japan Pension Fund Association (PFA), the
nation's largest corporate pension fund holder chaired by Mr Noboru Terada,
had net unrealised losses of 11 per cent at the end of the last financial
year. The unrealised losses on stocks were more than 30 per cent, according
to the organisation.
The yield on PFA funds was 3.84 per cent in the fiscal 1991, down from 6 per
cent the year earlier. This decline represented the first time the
association failed to achieve its annual target of 5.5 per cent since 1967,
when it was established.
Mr Tsuyoshi Igarashi, assistant manager of general planning section in the
Pension Trust Department at Sumitomo Trust and Banking, said declining stock
prices prompted the use of some foreign managers to help administer billions
of yen in pension fund assets. Foreign managers are seen to have more
experience in their own markets and the ability to generate higher
performance and lower risk on assets. Japanese institutions, in contrast,
have lacked competition, which resulted in lower returns, particularly when
the stock market declined.
Mr Tadaharu Goto, director of the corporate pension plans division at the
ministry of health and welfare agreed. He said he expects extended use of
foreign managers in the futures due to the need by domestic institutions to
obtain better returns.
Mr Yugi Kudo, the president of Schroder Investment Management Japan,
speculates that the ministry of finance took a step in that direction when
it allowed foreign asset managers to place up to 70 per cent of their
pension fund assets in foreign currency assets - a much higher percentage
than domestic managers. But Mr Kudo added that general conditions for
foreign investors are restrictive at best.
Foreign managers who entered the market early may ultimately benefit from a
further opening of Japan's pension fund market. But it is unlikely that the
cozy relationships between the nation's life insurance companies, trust
banks and government will change in the short-term.
In the end, the ageing society has created a pressure of its own. Because
Japan has the highest life expectancy in the world, higher yields on assets
are desperately needed to offset future liabilities as the average age of
the workforce increases.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (4): Eyes are switching to
overseas markets - US / Patrick Harverson discovers that horizons have
widened considerably
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<TEXT>
THE US can seem an extraordinarily parochial place at times. Despite the
dominant role the country plays in global politics, economics and business,
Americans' understanding of the world outside their borders can appear
shallow.
For many years there has been a similarly narrow approach to investing. A
deep-seated reluctance among investors to consider putting their money
anywhere other than the domestic equity and debt markets has ensured that
billions of dollars in investment capital has never left US shores.
Well, not any more. In the past decade, US investors have gradually awakened
to the potential for gains in foreign markets.
Even the pension funds, among the most conservative elements of the US
investing community, have embraced the idea of opening their eyes to the
world.
According to various estimates, just over Dollars 150bn in US pension fund
assets was invested outside the country at the end of 1992, say Connecticut
consultant firms Greenwich Associates and InterSec Research.
About three quarters of the total was in stocks and the rest in fixed-income
securities. In comparison, in 1987 roughly Dollars 50bn of fund assets was
invested overseas.
While growth in non-US investments over the past five years has been
impressive, industry observers expect it to accelerate during the rest of
the 1990s. In its latest study of pension funds, published last month,
Greenwich Associates forecasts that total US pension assets invested
overseas will reach Dollars 280bn by 1995. InterSec is even more optimistic.
It forecasts that by 1997 non-domestic pension fund investments will have
almost tripled to Dollars 430bn.
(It should be noted that this growth will not just come from new money
flows, but potentially also from increased investment returns, which will
inflate the value of funds' existing and new overseas assets.)
While these numbers seem large, they still only represent a fraction of
total assets held by US pension funds, which according to InterSec stood at
Dollars 3,315bn last year. In other words, less than 5 per cent of assets
are currently invested abroad.
In contrast, pension funds in other countries are more global in their
outlook. About 8 per cent of Japanese pension fund assets are invested
outside Japan, while 26 per cent of UK assets are invested in non-UK
markets.
Analysts, however, anticipate that interest in non-domestic investments will
grow fastest in the US. InterSec sees 10 per cent of fund assets invested
abroad by 1997, while it expects overseas assets held by Japanese funds to
grow to 10 per cent, and assets held by UK funds to grow to 28 per cent, in
the same period.
If there is an overriding reason why US funds are becoming more interested
in international investing it is a desire for diversification - to find a
new asset class that offers some kind of insurance against declining
domestic markets and asset values.
Before funds started investing overseas, the domestic markets fully
satisfied their investment needs. Until the rise of the German, Japanese and
other Far Eastern economies, US assets accounted for more than half of the
world's capital markets. Today, that share has dropped to about a third.
As Mr Arthur McCain, vice-president of InterSec, says: 'Pension funds have
to ask themselves: Why should I turn my back on two-thirds of the world
market?'
The answer, he says, used to be: 'I'm too scared to invest abroad.'
Not any more. Along with the realisation that they need to go overseas to
diversify their portfolios and spread their risk, fund managers have become
more sophisticated, and have learned to understand, not mistrust, foreign
markets. 'The driving force (of overseas investing) is diversification, and
an equal force is the reduction of fear,' explains Mr McCain.
Diversification must be the key to the internationalisation of US funds
because they are certainly not investing abroad because they have been
impressed by the returns available outside the US.
Over the past five years (1988-1992), on an annualised basis, the Standard &amp;
Poors' 500 index has returned just under 16 per cent. In stark contrast,
over the same period the dollar return on Morgan Stanley's Europe
Australasia Far East (EAFE) index of 20 foreign stock markets was a meagre
1.6 per cent. Returns from overseas investments were no better in
fixed-income markets. Merrill Lynch's US bond index returned 11.6 per cent
between 1988-1992 on an annualised basis, while its non-North American bond
index returned only 6.2 per cent.
While past performance has been poor, some of the recent overseas investing
by funds undoubtedly has been based on the assumption that foreign markets
will do better than domestic markets in future years. In particular, there
is a feeling that while US bonds yields have probably reached bottom and
have only one way to go, overseas bond yields, which have been much higher
than US yields in recent years, are heading down. Similarly, some investors
see little room for growth in US equities, but plenty overseas if
undervalued foreign stocks and fast-growth economies can be quickly
identified.
Although they are embracing globalisation, pension funds remain relatively
conservative in where they put their money. The European and Japanese
markets remain the biggest recipients of US money. The much-talked about
'emerging markets' of Latin America and Asia have been targeted more closely
in the last year or so, but essentially they still remain more talked-about
than targeted.
Inevitably, the internationalisation of US pension funds assets has spawned
interest among fund managers in currency hedging.
The use of hedging techniques to manage foreign exchange risk can be a
double-edged sword for funds - it can reduce currency risk, but it can also
limit the returns on overseas assets. After all, the dollar's poor
performance against foreign currencies since the mid-1970s has militated
against the need for hedging.
As one fund analyst, pointing out the recent record-breaking performance of
the Japanese yen against the US dollar, explains: 'If you were in yen assets
over the last couple of months, you would have done pretty well. But if
you'd hedged those assets back into the dollar, you would have lost a lot of
the benefits.'
While the majority of the hedging by pension funds remains of the passive
variety - where it is used as a tool of currency risk management - a growing
number of players are viewing hedging as a potential profit-centre in its
own right.
A recent survey by Callan Associates and the magazine Pensions &amp; Investments
found that while 24 per cent of fund executives said they were using or were
interested in passive currency hedging, 45 per cent said the same about
active currency hedging.
The big Wall Street investment banks and securities houses are,
understandably, extremely eager to win funds over to hedging as a means of
exploiting currency volatility. For example, a number of US funds are
participating in pools of managed derivatives that essentially speculate on
currency movements.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Switzerland (2): Signs of strain more evident -
Political scene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER

<TEXT>
POLITICAL life in Switzerland is normally active, but tranquil.
With their cherished system of direct democracy, the Swiss are almost always
about to vote on something at either local, cantonal or national level. But
the issues involved are usually quite homely - on zoning bylaws or the need
for a new school.
Meanwhile, debates on issues of national importance tend to be muted by the
existence of a broad and loose coalition government composed of all four
main political parties. The role of the opposition is left largely to the
people themselves in the plebiscites. The Swiss believe that this system
ensures that the country's minorities, both linguistic and religious, are
all included in the process and therefore do not become alienated.
And, as many Swiss will tell you, everyone in the country belongs to a
minority. Even the massive majority of German Swiss think of themselves as a
minority within the German culture. Indeed, their fears of being swamped by
other Germans was probably the main reason a majority of them voted last
December against joining the European Economic Area (EEA).
However, in the past few years, this subtle political system has come under
increasing stress. The country has come up against issues, such as the
environment and the need for an army, that have divided political parties
and groups of citizens in unexpected ways, leaving the government uncertain
about how to act.
In the past few months, these strains have become more pronounced. The
results of the EEA referendum showed splits not only between French and
German speaking Swiss, as was expected, but also between the young and the
old and between town and country. Moreover, the Italian Swiss, who side with
the Romands on most issues, went with the Germans on this one, apparently
reflecting their nervousness about getting too close to Italy.
The government remains committed to European integration but cannot push too
hard for fear of aggravating these divisions. Then in January when Mr Rene
Felber, the social democratic foreign minister, decided to resign for health
reasons, the system was suddenly rocked by a surge of feminist power.
The Social Democratic Party, which had the right to name a replacement for
Mr Felber in the seven-seat cabinet, sensed the mood and selected a woman,
Ms Christiane Brunner, from among their ranks.
The stolid men of the centre and right wing parties did not, however,
appreciate the idea of having a woman in the cabinet, and they attempted
rather crudely to discredit her, partly because of her unorthodox dress and
life-style, but mainly because she was on record as supporting the idea of
abolishing the Swiss army. Their tactics provoked thousands of women of all
political stripes and linguistic backgrounds to take to the streets, and
eventually they agreed to the election of another woman, Ms Ruth Dreifuss,
to the cabinet.
The strength of the woman-power phenomenon has been shown in recent cantonal
elections, too. In Neuchatel a few weeks ago, the number of women holding
seats in the 115 seat assembly doubled from 15 to 31. Similar increases were
seen in elections in Aargau and Solothurn.
No one expects the feminist power phenomenon to go away, but it remains to
be seen what, if any, impact it and other new issues will have on the
political structure. One thing though is clear. Nothing will happen
impulsively - 'I think we're clever enough not to change our system unless
we can find a better way,' says Mr Adolf Ogi, the transport minister and
this year's president.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Switzerland (5): Cartels under attack -
Competition policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DENUNCIATION of Switzerland last autumn by the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) for condoning cartels came as little
surprise to those familiar with the country.
Prices for many goods and services are outrageously high compared with those
in neighbouring countries, and for no apparent reason.
According to the OECD's study, the average prices of goods and services for
private consumption in Switzerland are 40 per cent higher than in the
average in the 24 OECD countries on a purchasing power parity basis. Prices
of goods and services for capital investment are 30 per cent higher.
The main reason for these disparities is that Swiss markets are riddled with
anti-competitive practices. The OECD found that price fixing or market
sharing agreements existed in no less than 90 per cent of 72 industrial
activities in the country.
If this state of affairs seems difficult to square with the fact that
Switzerland is a very open trading nation (except in agriculture), the
answer seems to be that many importers are only too happy to join Swiss
cartels, either directly or through their local distributors.
Swiss leaders have long recognised that their tolerance of cartels will have
to come to an end. The problem is mobilising political support to revise
laws and regulations affecting competition.
Swiss law does not expressly prohibit cartels. Rather, a plaintiff must
prove that the effects of a cartel are, on balance, economically harmful, in
order to win a legal case. In most cases, especially in prosperous
Switzerland, that is difficult to do.
There have been several cases in recent years - notably in the banking,
insurance and cement sectors - where long and costly investigations have led
to indecisive results.
The latest drive for reform began in 1991 when the federal cabinet, in
anticipation of the country moving towards integration with the European
Community, adopted a new competition policy. Its thrust was that Switzerland
could not hope to compete in world markets in the future without having
competitive markets at home.
The government's hope then was that the country would join the European
Economic Area (EEA), the expanded free trade area linking the seven
countries of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) with the EC. Then it
would have to take on EC competition law, and the problem would solve
itself.
In the event, a majority of Swiss voted against joining the EEA last
December 6, and so the government had to take matters into its own hands.
A commission of experts was set up in December, and it has already submitted
a draft reform for comments from various interested parties. A final draft
is expected by the end of June and then it will enter the complex Swiss
legislative process.
The OECD called for a fundamentally revised competition law in which 'the
protection of the competition process per se should be established as as an
overriding objective.'
But that is not going to happen. According to officials in Bern, the thrust
of the reform will be to outlaw specific anti-competitive practices, such as
output quotas, territorial divisions, boycotts, price maintenance schemes
and price fixing.
A further amendment would subject all competition cases to administrative
law. At the moment, some are handled under civil law, which results in long
drawn-out cases.
The reason for taking this more specific route is that a change of general
principle would involve a change in the Swiss constitution, and thus require
a referendum. This would take a long time and might end up being vetoed by
voters.
In any event, the result of the planned reform will be largely the same. One
of its main positive effects, according to Mr Andreas Limburg, who has just
completed his doctorate on the subject, would be to simplify the
investigation and enforcement processes.
Thus, it would answer another OECD criticism that the Cartel Commission does
not have adequate resources to do its job. In the future, the commission
will not have to determine whether or not a particular practice is socially
harmful. If there is proof of price fixing, for example, that will be
sufficient for it to take action.
The official objective is to pass legislation by year-end, but that looks
ambitious. Opposition, which was muted during the run-up to the EEA vote,
has now surfaced within the business establishment, and officials recall
that the last attempt to reform cartel law began in the early 1970s and
finally resulted in a new law only in 1985.
The most controversial area is probably merger control. At the moment,
companies are not obliged to notify anyone of their intention to merge. The
Cartel Commission has the right to investigate mergers and can make
recommendations on the merged company's future behaviour but cannot
recommend or order divestiture.
The argument against establishing a domestic merger control system is that
the country's market is too small to be significant. Also, in the cases of
very large company mergers, the companies involved will almost certainly
have a sufficiently large presence in the EC that they will have to go
through EC clearance procedures.
This was the case, for example, for Credit Suisse's recent SFr1.6bn takeover
of Swiss Volksbank and last year's takeover by Swiss Reinsurance of Elvia.
Apart from revisions to the cartel law, several other actions to promote
freer competition are in the works, such as liberalising the labour market,
providing for mutual recognition of qualifications and eliminating various
non-tariff barriers.
Switzerland has an extraordinary array of NTBs, from special dimensions for
refrigerators to unique anti-pollution specifications for cars. Yoghurt
cannot be called yoghurt unless it is packaged in 180 gram, 250 gram, 500
gram or one kilogram containers.
'Any single item is not that important, but if we change a lot of things
with a view to facilitating market access, we can have an effect,' says Mr
Peter Saurer, head of the government's general economic policy office.
Recently, the association of cantonal governments agreed in principle to
opening up their SFr30bn annual public procurement market. Most cantons now
have regulations stipulating that only local companies need tender, but they
now realise they could save a lot of money by opening up to bidders from
other cantons and even from abroad.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Switzerland (3): Recession proves hard to
shake-off - Recovery expected by end of the year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MCKAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE unexpectedly persistent recession that has gripped Switzerland since
mid-1991 is proving difficult to escape from as businesses come to terms
with a future outside the European Economic Area, and consumers adapt to two
more years of decline in real disposable income - under the shadow of the
country's highest unemployment in 50 years.
If unemployment figures were a barometer of real economic performance, then
the present jobless rate of 4.9 per cent and rising would indicate the most
serious economic conditions since the 1930s. However, while even official
sources no longer rule out the possibility of the number of unemployed
increasing from the present 150,000 to 200,000 within the next year, the
turning point in the economic cycle is no longer far away.
In the two previous recessions, in 1974 and 1982, the Swiss government was
able to 'export' its unemployment problem, but improved residence rights for
foreign workers preclude this course of action. The job market has also
contracted because of structural re-adjustments in the domestic economy and
the hangover effects of four years of strict monetary policy.
The Swiss National Bank's strong medicine has worked, but at some cost.
Inflation, which reached a high of 6.6 per cent in the summer of 1991, is
hovering at just over 3 per cent, although the reserve bank's year-end
target of 2.5 per cent is unlikely to be met.
ONE of the most serious concerns on the domestic front is the construction
industry. Some estimates suggest that in order to use the over-capacity in
commercial and industrial property, another 70,000-90,000 jobs would have to
be created between now and the end of the decade. Office rents in the
commercial capital, Zurich, are now less than half those of the mid-1980s
for new tenants.
According to Mr Hans Kaufmann, chief economist of Bank Julius Baer, in
Zurich, orders in the construction industry are down 26 per cent in nominal
terms. The situation has reached the critical point where capacity might
have to be sharply reduced - 'if orders do not pick up this year, the
construction sector will have to shed another 15,000-20,000 jobs,' he says.
A government attempt to stimulate construction by offering 15 per cent
subsidies for public works projects in the 23 cantons, or mini-states -
similar to a programme which largely succeeded in the 1980s - is expected to
have negligible effect this time. In theory, it could have led to additional
spending of SFr1.6bn (Pounds 710m), or 3 per cent of the total outlays in a
sector which accounts for 17 per cent of GDP.
However, the cantons and municipalities have been slow to make use of this
money, the main reason being the soaring overall public deficit of between
SFr10bn-Sfr11bn. Some SFr3bn is being carried by the federal government and
the further SFr7bn-SFr8bn by the cantons and local councils combined. In the
early 1980s they were in surplus.
The construction sector is one of the worst examples of Switzerland's
cartel-riven and unbalanced internal market. A recent study estimates that
the public sector pays SFr7bn-SFr8bn a year more for construction projects
than if a free market were in operation. If the federal government or the
cantonal authorities wanted to construct a building in Zurich, only
Zurich-based companies could legally submit tenders.
Analysts at the country's leading banks forecast a further decline in GDP in
1993 of between 0.3 per cent and 0.7 per cent, after a fall of 0.6 per cent
last year. But they are unanimous that recovery will be well under way by
the turn of the year. Growth forecasts for 1994 are between 1-1.5 per cent.
Meanwhile, 1995 is seen as the year of the return of Switzerland's
traditional annual growth levels of 2 per cent or more. Optimism is geared
to the go-ahead then of large public works; a SFr30bn-SFr40bn alpine tunnels
project is to be completed over 10 years, four gaps in the motorway network
are to be filled, and work will restart on the SFr8bn Railway 2000 project,
only 10 per cent of which has been completed.
In the short-term, weak consumer spending will continue to be a drag on the
recovery. Private consumption is expected to decline by 0.5 per cent after
last year's fall of 0.3 per cent, in the face of job uncertainty, another
fall in real wages, and increases in petrol tax and unemployment insurance
contributions.
Mr Manfred Gutmann, chief economist of the Union Bank of Switzerland, said
the banking and insurance sectors would expect to shed more jobs this year.
Some analysts expect the job-cuts to be as high as 2,500 to 3,000 - 'banks
and insurance companies are no longer able to absorb as before people laid
off from the industrial sector as job creation in services has peaked.'
He expects unemployment to average about 4 per cent for the next three or
four years - a new situation for a country accustomed for decades to near
full employment.
There appears still to be scope for a further loosening of monetary policy.
Mr Georg Rich, the reserve bank's chief economist said he could see interest
rates declining further this year, but was cautious on the recovery - 'I
think things will improve in the second half, but any improvement will be
modest. In my view it has to come from the domestic side because I think the
external side still looks relatively grim.'
While Swiss exports were the main support of the economy in 1992, growing
5.5 per cent in real terms, they are expected to be flat this year.
Exporters are suffering from the slowdown in the EC, particularly in
Germany. Given weaker EC investment demand, a fall-off in exports will be
felt most in the industrial machinery sector.
The negative effects of Switzerland's no-vote in the EEA referendum will
take some time to gauge. However, there is a feeling in Bern that the
government's traditional perception of itself as a Sonderfall (special case)
in the international arena will guide it through any difficulties with the
Brussels hierarchy, to whom it has always had privileged access.
Mr Pierre-Louis Girard, the country's senior negotiator in the Uruguay Round
of the Gatt world trade talks, said both the EC and Switzerland could recoup
what they aimed to do in the EEA - 'a successful Uruguay Round would in fact
solve the problems we would be faced with in the absence of a bilateral
agreement in the sense of the EEA, or in the field of public procurement.'
Mr Girard said non-membership of the EEA was as likely to cost Switzerland
in growth terms no more than would an appreciation of the Swiss franc at any
given time.
Throughout the EC big Swiss companies are in entrenched positions which may
not be easily dismantled.
'We have 8 per cent of our overall trade with Baden-Wurttemberg, one German
state. There is cross-border co-operation, the same mentality, the same
structures, the same economic conditions,' says Mr Girard.
In the meantime, Swiss corporate earnings growth is expected to pursue its
upward trend. Falling interest rates are also likely to stimulate the Swiss
stock market, as more attractive instruments are sought in which to reinvest
some of the estimated SFr700bn in short-term investments. The Swiss franc,
which weakened in the first quarter, is expected to strengthen later in the
year.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (2): Past success brings
rewards - Barry Riley analyses the performance of the top managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MAY be tough at the top, where the number one pension fund management
house Mercury Asset Management had to cope with a boardroom reshuffle last
year, but it can be even worse down below.
The remarkable process of concentration of external managers in the UK's
pension fund sector continued unabated last year. Although MAM suffered a
tiny erosion of market share, the next three - Phillips &amp; Drew Fund
Management, Schroder Investment Management and Barclays de Zoete Wedd
Investment Management - all showed gains.
Amazingly, however, there are something like 180 management firms actively
seeking business from UK pension funds, a total which has been steadily
rising. For most the pickings are very thin. But the bulk of them are
seeking specialist rather than balanced mandates.
And many of the more recent entrants are managers from the US, Japan and
Continental Europe seeking to pick up geographical briefs.
A few years ago some of the pension consultants, who are influential in
manager selection, attempted to shift the arguably excessive focus on past
performance. They wanted to emphasise other factors, such as efficiency and
levels of client service. However, this has not worked.
According to Mr Roger Urwin, who heads the investment section at consultants
R. Watson, the 'wish list' presented by trustees has become quite
standardised. They want top performance, consistency and also the comfort
given by large size.
US-style boutiques are generally shunned. A handful of top managers
therefore gets nearly all the new business, at least for balanced
management.
'Concentration in balanced funds will continue,' he says. 'But one does
expect some changes at the top.'
One crude way of assessing concentration is to look at the market share of
the top four in the FT's annual table, as a proportion of the funds
controlled by the leading 20 houses. In 1984 the leading quartet (not then
quite the same as the present top four) had a share of 39 per cent. By 1988,
this proportion had climbed to 44 per cent, and now it is 51 per cent.
The fruits of consistently good performance have been substantial. This
year, for the first time, we are printing a table of investment results,
following the introduction of a standard code of performance measurement for
fund management groups, backed by the National Association of Pension Funds
and other industry bodies.
Not all the individual management houses have supplied figures. Mercury is
the most notable absentee, for reasons which it is reluctant to spell out,
but are probably related to the fairly wide dispersion of the results of the
hundreds of funds which it manages. Other managers give greater priority to
holding individual client returns close to the house median.
At any rate, over five years it is clear that PDFM, Gartmore and Schroder
among the big houses have achieved outstanding returns. They have therefore
been the leading winners of new business. The small independent firm Newton
has the best figures of all, and in consequence has been expanding rapidly
too, although from a relatively tiny base.
BZWIM, another big success story, has a radically different approach. It is
the market leader in index-tracking funds, and has picked up a lot of
business from rival houses that have performed badly as active managers.
Altogether a group of six managers is tending to pull away from the rest,
including Prudential Portfolio Managers - although PPM (along with MAM) was
unfortunate enough to lose a Pounds 500m slice of the Marks &amp; Spencer fund
last year.
This happened not because of bad performance but because M&amp;S wished to adopt
a low risk indexed approach. Some of the money, incidentally, went to BZWIM.
Just outside the top six, managers such as Robert Fleming and County NatWest
Investment Management have been finding the going tough, being unable to
produce consistently good results.
The results of individual years may not mean all that much in such a
long-term business as pension fund management, but 1992 turned out to be a
brilliant one for Gartmore, which in a few years has moved from nowhere to
sixth place in volume terms. It returned an amazing 26.3 per cent in 1992
against a Caps median of 20.6 per cent and a WM weighted average of 18.6.
PDFM was not far behind in performance terms. According to the newsletter
Global Money Management the top new business winners of 1992 included not
only Gartmore, PDFM, Schroder and BZWIM but also Baillie Gifford, the
current star of the Scottish firmament. BG is coy about its investment
performance, but it has plainly had a very good run. For the time being,
however, it is closed for new business as it concentrates on consolidation
after its recent rapid expansion.
Outside the select few, it is a tough task for firms even to get on to the
short list for new mandates. 'There is overcapacity in the balanced fund
business,' says Roger Urwin. 'Organisations caught in the middle with
relatively poor performance have a difficult task to keep going in the
pension fund field.'
Robert Fleming, for instance, spoilt its performance numbers last year by
moving prematurely back into the Japanese equity market.
Mr Iain Saunders, Fleming's investment chief, explains that he is working
hard to get the discretionary balanced performance up to scratch, but in the
meantime the company is focusing quite successfully on winning specialist
accounts.
His aim is for steady rather than dramatic performance. 'We aim to achieve a
lower risk approach with our mainstream balanced product,' he says.
Certainly there are different styles, even among the big balanced managers.
Probably Schroder is currently the leading exponent of the consistent,
just-above-median style which can be attractive to trustees who want to
sleep at nights. But as it happened, Schroder was below the median in 1992.
Gartmore's more aggressive style was the one that paid off in a big way last
year. Mr David Watts, the company's head of pension funds, says that
Gartmore is unusual in deriving about half of its outperformance from
strategy, whereas other managers depend mostly on stock selection.
Can Gartmore continue to perform as it gets bigger? Mr Watts is determined
to persist with a similar approach. 'Other big firms stop taking decisions,
but we are backing our judgment,' he says.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (3): Cash flow squeeze
tightens - Schemes may become more expensive for sponsors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR A few years in the late 1980s it seemed to many companies that their
pension schemes magically paid for themselves. But now it looks - especially
after the March Budget moves on dividend taxation - as though schemes will
become a lot more expensive for their corporate sponsors. This will be
painful for the companies but just might bring benefits to fund managers who
have often been starved of incoming money.
The cash flow squeeze on the occupational pension fund sector intensified
last year. According to the performance measurement specialists The WM
Company, new money received last year amounted to only 1 per cent of initial
market value, having steadily dropped from 12 per cent 10 years earlier,
when schemes were often trying to make up accumulated deficits.
Given that the average income return on pension funds in 1992 will have been
of the order of 4 per cent, it is evident that the bulk of income is now
being used to pay benefits. According to the latest annual survey by the
National Association of Pension Funds of its member schemes, more than half
the schemes reported that the employer was enjoying either a complete
contribution holiday or a reduction from what would be regarded as normal
contribution levels. In nearly all cases, however, the employees are
continuing to contribute as usual.
In a few extreme cases companies have actually negotiated a repayment of
surpluses from their pension schemes. For instance, Courtaulds announced at
the end of March that its scheme was 27 per cent overfunded, with a surplus
of Pounds 189m. In a package deal with the trustees, benefits will be
upgraded and Courtaulds will receive Pounds 50m in cash, after tax. Similar
moves have been announced by Courtaulds' former subsidiary, the
now-independent Courtaulds Textiles, and by Hoover.
Government statistics show that new investments of occupational pension
schemes amounted to Pounds 16bn in 1990, Pounds 8bn in 1991 and only about
Pounds 4bn last year. Fortunately for the investment managers the existing
funds have been rising in value quite fast so the total value of pension
funds has been rising (reaching Pounds 370bn by the end of 1992, according
to WM) even though new money has tailed off.
Although investment managers have achieved high returns, this is not the
main reason for the surpluses. Rather, the crucial factor has been the
extraordinary buoyancy of British company dividends in the late 1980s
(peaking at 18 per cent annual growth in 1989). Also, the substantial
reductions in the workforces of many industrial companies earlier in the
1980s had the effect of reducing scheme liabilities.
Actuarial valuations are usually based upon projected income streams rather
than on market prices, and rising dividends transformed the calculations
during the late 1980s. But dividend growth slowed in 1991 and came to a
grinding halt in 1992. Because scheme liabilities, measured in terms
ofearnings growth, will have continued to rise by 5 per cent or so, the
surpluses will have been eroded slightly last year, quite apart from the
impact of contribution holidays and repayments from the funds.
What will happen to dividends this year? Well, most analysts believe that
there will be a significant rise in company profits in 1993, perhaps of the
order of 15-20 per cent, but on the other hand dividend cover is much less
than it used to be. So dividends will rise only very slowly.
The immediate topic of great interest, however, is the change in the advance
corporation tax rules announced by the chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, in
March. In helping companies with a problem of surplus ACT that they cannot
reclaim out of tax on their profits, he at the same time hit out at
tax-exempt shareholders, notably pension funds.
Instead of being able to claim back tax at the rate of 25 per cent on
dividends, funds are now only entitled to a 20 per cent rebate. This means
that whereas last year a Pounds 75 dividend could be grossed up to Pounds
100, this year it is worth only Pounds 93.75 to a pension fund. At a stroke,
Mr Lamont therefore cut pension funds' gross dividend income by a proportion
which works out at 6 1/4 per cent.
The overall impact of this is still unclear. A very few companies have
raised their dividends to compensate. Income from fixed interest securities
such as the government's own gilt-edged bonds is unaffected. So although a
simple calculation would suggest that the actuarial value of a pension
fund's UK equity portfolio should be reduced by 6 1/4 per cent, the
actuaries may make slightly more generous assumptions about dividend growth.
Moreover, the 40 per cent of portfolios invested, on average, in other kinds
of assets will not be affected.
Realistically the overall effect could be to reduce valuations by about 3 to
4 per cent, and although in itself this is scarcely disastrous, it will
bring forward the time at which full contributions must be resumed.
This will bring a little more cash into portfolios, but fund managers may
need to be wary of negative factors too. Might the tax breaks on pension
schemes be further reduced as the government grapples with its huge fiscal
deficits? If this goes too far companies might wonder whether they really
need to support such large and expensive schemes.
The recommendations of the Goode Committee on pension scheme law might also
prove important. If it appears likely that surpluses will become the
property of beneficiaries, companies will be extremely reluctant to fund
their schemes generously.
Underfunding could become the rule. That would, naturally, not be in the
interests of the investment managers who are remunerated in proportion to
the size of the portfolios. But the completion of the Goode Report has been
put off until the end of September, and legislation is unlikely to follow at
all quickly. For the time being the likelihood is that the cash flow into
pension funds will slowly begin to recover in strength.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Switzerland (1): On the move once more - Rejection
of European Economic Area membership has provided the government with an
opportunity to shake the Swiss out of their complacency. A range of
liberalisation measures is now being introduced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR ago, the European Community was forging ahead confidently to a united
future, while the doggedly neutral Swiss were agonising over whether or not
to participate in the process of European integration.
Today, it is the EC that is in a dither over its future, while Switzerland,
having made its fateful decision not to board the Eurotrain, at least for
the time being, is moving ahead purposefully to create a more liberal,
competitive society on its own.
'We have to be economically at least as liberal as the EC,' says Mr Adolf
Ogi, transport minister and this year's president of the confederation, (see
page three of this survey: interview with Mr Ogi).
The president and the government as a whole regret that a majority of the
Swiss people voted in an historic referendum last December against joining
the European Economic Area (EEA), the enlarged free trade area being created
between the EC and the member-countries of the European Free Trade
Association (EFTA).
And they are at pains to point out that Switzerland does not seek to isolate
itself from Europe or the world. After all, the Swiss voted last year at
long last in favour of joining the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank. They also endorsed a treaty with the EC that commits Switzerland to
drilling two new rail tunnels through the Alps at a prodigious cost of more
than SFr30bn.
Moreover, as the recent row over exports of Pilatus trainer aircraft to
South Africa showed, there is a new sensitivity to international opinion in
this formerly aloof country. The government is even reviewing its long
cherished neutrality policy, conscious that it must do its share in
multilateral efforts to build and protect the post cold war order.
The government is now trying to turn the EEA rejection into an opportunity.
Mr Ogi hopes the vote was the shock that was needed to shake the Swiss out
of their arrogance and complacency - 'we were a bit spoiled,' he says.
Bern is pressing ahead with economic liberalisation measures that would have
been impossible to implement even a year ago.
From last week, for example, the immigration door, hitherto nearly closed,
is wide open to highly qualified citizens of other European countries, the
idea being to help Swiss-based companies compete everywhere for the best
talent.
Further measures to bust the country's notorious cartels, open public
procurement and remove a number of sly non-tariff barriers are due to be
implemented later this year. And another attempt will be made to introduce a
value added tax.
Regeneration and liberalisation are also the themes of the day in Swiss
industry, which has had its own struggles with complacency in recent years.
The important watch industry is the most famous case, fully recovered from
the competitive challenge from Japan in the late 1970s and once again
leading its field with innovative products and processes.
In the heavy engineering sector, several venerable and world famous
companies, such as Brown Boveri, Sulzer Brothers, Oerlikon-Buhrle and
Alusuisse, have shaken off rigid old habits and become vigorous again.
The country's financial sector, which grew so fat and rich during the
international financial turmoil of the late 1960s and 1970s that it largely
missed the competitive challenges of the 1980s, is undergoing a long overdue
shake-up.
In the past two years, some 60 banks have been taken over or closed,
including two of the largest, Bank Leu and Swiss Volksbank. Outmoded laws
and regulations are being revised to make Swiss financial markets
competitive with those elsewhere.
All this does not mean that Switzerland is about to experience a great
economic boom. In or outside the EEA, its economy is still heavily dependent
on trade with neighbouring European countries, especially lacklustre
Germany.
THE latest forecasts indicate that the economy will suffer a third year of
modest decline in GDP this year with only very gradual recovery in 1994.
Unemployment, hitherto unknown to the Swiss, has become a serious problem as
companies have shed their inhibitions about redundancies and immigrant
workers no longer return to their countries when they lose their jobs.
Government deficits, bloated by the recession-driven rise in welfare
payments, are expected to reach a combined SFr10bn or about 3 per cent of
GDP this year, still modest by international standards, but shocking to the
thrifty Swiss.
It is still too early to tell what will be the economic impact of the
country's decision not to join the EEA. For one thing, the EEA treaty has
not yet come into effect, and probably will not do so until next year
because of wrangles over writing Switzerland out of it.
There have been sporadic reports of Swiss exporters facing increased red
tape at EC borders and of local companies shifting new investments outside
Switzerland. But in the current slump, no one expected investment to be
buoyant.
In the immediate aftermath of the vote, Swiss researchers were struck-off EC
project committees, but the government is confident that these decisions
will gradually be rolled back as the committees contemplate the size of
Swiss financial contributions to their budgets.
The government's biggest anxiety is over civil aviation and, in particular,
access for Swissair to the about to be opened EC skies. This, of course, is
as much a political as an economic issue.
Swiss negotiators were careful to include aviation in the treaty agreed last
year with the EC settling the painful problem of lorry transit through the
Alps.
The idea was that Switzerland would finance and build two new high speed
rail tunnels through the Alps and the EC, in return, would agree to
negotiate a bilateral air traffic agreement with Switzerland in the event
that the country did not join the EEA.
Bern has lost no time in calling on the EC to honour its commitment, but the
EC seems in no hurry. There have been suggestions that the negotiation could
proceed more quickly if the Swiss were to give ground on other matters.
Spain, for example, is unhappy about Swiss restrictions on imports of garden
vegetables, especially tomatoes. It is also angry that the financial aid
coming from the EFTA countries as their EEA joining fee will now be
significantly smaller because Switzerland is not among them. It probably
matters that the EC commissioner for transport is Mr Abel Matutes, a
Spaniard.
The Swiss fear that other EC countries will notice that this is perhaps an
opportune time to raise any old scores they have to settle with the country.
The EEA vote has had a psychological impact on the Swiss.
Hitherto aloof and confident, they are showing signs of isolation.
In the past, the many Europeans who married with Swiss were always eager to
get a Swiss passport. Now the reverse is happening. One hears several
reports of the Swiss in these partnerships hastily filing for EC passports.
Switzerland's multicultural society continues to show other strains.
The recent angry demonstrations by women all over the country at the
mistreatment of a woman candidate for a vacant Cabinet position incidates a
new impatience with male domination in their society.
Next month's plebiscites on the future of the army could also unveil deep
divisions over an institution that has been one of the few unifying forces
in this diverse country. And the country's leaders remain unable to resolve
their outsize drug problem.
People were horrified to learn the other day of a 12-year-old girl in Zurich
who had turned to prostitution to pay for her heroin addiction.
But even this harrowing problem should be kept in context. Switzerland
remains surprisingly civilised, as I discovered anew one afternoon a few
weeks ago when my bicycle was stolen from a downtown Zurich pavement.
A few minutes after discovering the theft, I spotted a scruffy young man
walking the bicycle along the street and confronted him. He was immediately
defensive and claimed to have just bought it in 'Heroin-gasse,' the drug
addicts' black market, for SFr40.
He asked me to reimburse him, but when I threatened to call for police help,
he immediately returned it and walked quickly away. If this had happened in
New York or London, I would have been lucky to have escaped uninjured - let
alone with my bicycle.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (1): Escape from ERM
squeeze - The top few fund management companies are strengthening their grip
on the Pounds 370bn occupational pension fund sector. They are satisfying
the demands of trustees by delivering high performance and consistency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
NEVER IN the history of pension fund investment has so much been invested on
behalf of so many by so few.
By the end of last year the top six external investment management companies
controlled UK pension fund portfolios worth Pounds 110bn. If you add in the
top few in-house managers, led by PosTel with Pounds 20bn, it is likely that
only about 10 or a dozen managers control half the Pounds 370bn total value
of UK pension funds.
Yet, at one level, the gravitation of assets towards the most successful
managers is no more than a normal process in a competitive market place.
Last year this was underlined by the way that many managers beat index
returns, both in terms of the UK and global stock markets. More than
two-thirds of all the funds measured by WM outperformed the All-Share return
in 1992, half of them by a full percentage point. International
outperformance was even more clearcut, with the average overseas equity
portfolio returning 19.7 per cent compared with just 16.4 per cent on the
World ex UK Index.
However, this may have represented an unusual combination of favourable
factors. In 1992, for instance, most UK managers were helped by their low
weightings of plunging pharmaceutical stocks, and they were also light in
Japan, the worst major international market.
But, as fewer and fewer managers come to dominate, their big bets can have a
disproportionate impact, sometimes for good but with worrying longer-term
implications. Excessive concentration could increase the risks of investment
and create distortions.
The focus of the problem changes from time to time, however. A few years ago
institutional investors were being roundly attacked for too readily
supporting aggressive takeovers, and for helping to generate undue
short-termism. But at present there are scarcely any contested takeover bids
so the criticism has shifted, concentrating, for instance, on the pressures
exerted on British companies for excessive dividend payments.
Last year's investment returns were much more fragile than they looked,
depending as they did on a final quarter which delivered, on average, some
14 percentage points of the 20.3 per cent annual return (excluding
property).
For much of last summer pension fund managers had a nail-biting time as
their traditional strategy of investing primarily in inflation-proof assets,
notably equities, threatened to clash violently with the UK's
anti-inflationary commitment to the European exchange rate mechanism.
September 17, Black or White Wednesday, depending on your point of view,
played into the hands of most pension fund managers by substantially
enhancing the value of the UK equities which typically make up almost 60 per
cent of the average portfolio. The sterling value of overseas equities and
bonds was also greatly increased.
So, it all worked out well in the end, but, nevertheless, the fundamentals
of UK equity market valuation are stretched. Company profits were flat, and
although they may well bounce back in most cases in 1993, dividend cover
will remain historically poor.
Dividends are especially important to pension funds, and not just because
they can claim back the tax on them. In the UK, actuaries value the assets
of pension schemes primarily on the basis of the income they generate,
rather than market values. Pension fund managers therefore take a dim view
when companies cut dividends - the impact on scheme surpluses could be
serious.
There have been many cases of companies raising new capital through rights
issues primarily to finance the flow of dividends. A large part of the
forthcoming Pounds 1.2bn rights issue by ICI/Zeneca, for example, will go
straight out again in dividends not covered by short-term profits.
Government statistics show dividends from the company sector as a whole
continuing to rise quite strongly throughout the recession, from Pounds 19bn
in 1989 to Pounds 25bn in 1992. However, new privatisations may have had
something to do with this, and the growth in dividends paid out by
constituent companies of the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index finally ground to
a halt in 1992.
While pension funds continue eagerly to lap up company dividends, they
equally continue to shun conventional British government securities.
According to WM, pension fund holdings of fixed interest gilts continued to
fall last year, and at 4 per cent of portfolios on average are no bigger
than the investments in foreign currency bonds. Another 3 per cent slice of
portfolios is in index-linked gilts.
Do the pension funds risk retaliation if they continue to be unresponsive to
the government's financial difficulties? After all, the government has a
Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement for the 1993-94 financial year and is now
running monthly Pounds 3bn gilt-edged auctions.
That is one explanation of the unexpected company tax changes in the March
Budget. By cutting the rate of tax on dividends which could be reclaimed by
pension funds and other exempt investors from 25 to 20 per cent the treasury
effectively imposed on pension funds a dividend tax worth perhaps Pounds
450m a year. More subtly, the relative appeal of gilt-edged interest, and
other non-dividend income, has been enhanced.
The gross UK dividend income received by pension funds has effectively been
reduced by 6 1/4 per cent. Little explanation of this has been offered by
the government, which has justified the ACT changes primarily in terms of
the transitional cash flow benefit to companies rather than the permanent
diminution of income of exempt shareholders.
But it is certainly possible to argue, theoretically, that a primary
original 1970s objective of the UK imputation system of corporation tax  -
to remove the previous tax bias against dividends as opposed to retentions -
has been overwhelmed in recent years by the rapid growth of tax-exempt
investors, notably pension funds. Indeed, a bias has developed towards
overdistribution.
One other cloud on the horizon is being anxiously watched. It is the
possibility that the present overwhelming predominance of final salary-based
pension schemes in the UK might be disturbed by a swing towards
money-purchase schemes which sidestep the controversy over surpluses.
There is no evidence that such a shift is happening yet, except among quite
small companies, but there is nervousness about what recommendations the
Goode Committee on pension law reform will make next September. Possibly,
new burdens and costs might be imposed upon companies operating final salary
schemes. There is in any case concern about the response of companies when
widespread pension contribution holidays come to an end and the full cost of
final salary-linked schemes must once again be borne.
Do we have Rolls-Royce pension schemes in the Ford Mondeo era? With
unemployment high it is no longer necessary for companies to offer generous
pension schemes to attract and retain employees. There is little sign that
companies will actually dismantle existing arrangements. But a recent survey
by the Alexander Consulting Group suggested that if companies were starting
again with a clean sheet only 29 per cent would launch a final salary scheme
(although 78 per cent have one now).
A widespread switch to money-purchase schemes would pose big challenges to
fund managers. Instead of having a single very long-term client in each
scheme they would have thousands of individual, shorter-term investors. They
would need to invest in lower risk assets, to address the needs of scheme
members approaching retirement.
Moreover, the greater participation of individual scheme members and,
probably, trade unions, would require investment managers to act much more
like retail institutions, offering simple, but flexible, products and
seeking to build customer-friendly images. It would be a major change of
approach for institutions, such as Mercury Asset Management and Phillips &amp;
Drew Fund Management, which are highly successful at dealing with
professional pension consultants and trustees but scarcely have high
profiles as far as the public at large is concerned.
If a shift towards money purchase were ever to become pronounced, it would
be likely to reverse the gravitation of money towards the top managers and
to lead to the kind of institutional proliferation more typical of the
retail investment market.
But for the time being the harsh process of natural selection continues in
the highly competitive world of pension fund management, and success still
belongs to the few.

FT  06 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Redland upgraded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The best performance in the FT-SE 100 came from Redland, the building
materials group, after the top-rated Kleinwort Benson building sector
research team lifted its earnings estimates for the company and upgraded its
recommendation on the stock from 'hold' to 'buy'.
At the close, Redland shares were 18p, or 3.85 per cent, higher at 468p,
after relatively high turnover of 2.7m shares. Kleinwort was said to have
lifted its 1993 pre-tax profits figures to Pounds 256m from a previous
Pounds 225m, and its 1994 estimate to Pounds 310m from Pounds 270m.
Shell Transport attracted a fresh burst of strong domestic buying interest
yesterday, with two of the leading London-based securities houses said to
have been aggressive supporters of the shares. They closed a further 6
higher at 562p, after good turnover of 5.6m shares.
BP was not left behind, and settled 2 higher at 296p, stimulated by renewed
demand prompted by NatWest Securities and also by sustained US buying
interest. BP reports first-quarter figures this morning. NatWest is
forecasting historic cost net income, including stock gains or losses of
Pounds 230m, against last time's Pounds 61m loss. On a replacement cost
basis, the broker is looking for net income of Pounds 220m against Pounds
95m. SGST, the French-owned broker, forecasts, pre-exceptional items,
historic net income of Pounds 190m, or on a replacement cost basis, net
income of Pounds 172m.
The call by the electricity industry regulator - Offer - for the generators
to account for their involvement in recent electricity pool price rises,
unsettled the generators and also affected sentiment in British Gas. The
latter eased 1 1/2 to 304p, while National Power dipped 2 to 321p and
PowerGen 4 to 324p.
Wellcome shares lost 11 to 728p on reports of a new rival to its AIDS drug
AZT. Verex Laboratories of the US said preliminary tests showed its version
of AZT could be more potent, longer-lasting and less toxic than Retrovir.
Wellcome later announced that it was looking into the legality of the Verex
claim.
SmithKline Beecham fell 12 to 469p in the 'A's, in spite of an announcement
that it is to co-promote a drug for US group Adria Laboratories. US
investors appeared to be selling pharmaceuticals stocks and also continued
unenthusiastic on ICI, which slipped 8 1/2 to 1264 1/2 p.
The world's biggest mining group RTZ fell 14 to 631p as it held its annual
meeting yesterday. The group said it expected no decisive improvement in
operating results until 1994 and chart analysts were predicting little
support for the stock before 550p. The shares have suffered recently from a
weak copper price.
A two-way pull in MFI saw the shares see-saw in heavy trade before finally
settling 2 adrift at 137p. Turnover was a hefty 13m. BZW, the latest broker
to return from visiting the discount furniture group, downgraded profit
forecasts and reiterated its negative stance. Hoare Govett and UBS were said
to be more positive.
Shares in Burton Group came off a penny to 78 1/2 p following the placing of
a line of 7m at 78p by Lehman Brothers.
In a quiet food retail sector, Asda had its short-term debt upgraded by US
credit agency Moody's. The shares closed a half-penny down at 69p. Tesco
added the same to 218p, with some talk that one leading securities house had
turned positive.
Banana importer Geest collapsed following a profits warning, the shares off
68 at 366p after touching 328p.
Coats Viyella shed 6 to 231p ahead of its annual meeting today.
Sports clothing group Campari rebounded 12 to 145p following the slide
prompted by Tuesday's profits warning.
Lucas Industries rose 4 to 140p on unusually heavy trade of 6.3m shares amid
renewed talk of a possible bid for the company.
One analyst argued that the company's poor profit performance made it a
viable bid candidate. The speculation has surrounded the company for some
time with BTR being seen as a likely predator. BTR shares fell 5 to 592p.
Trafalgar House, which reported a loss of Pounds 97.6m for the first-half
compared to a profit of Pounds 54m previously, lifted 3 to 95p as the
company signalled an upturn in property and increased investment in the Far
East. Also board changes and general recovery prospects helped sentiment.
More details of the BT III flotation, plus news that the company has
terminated discussions with Electronic Data Systems, the US computing
services group, failed to trigger any substantial flurry of interest in BT
although the shares rallied from an early 401p to close only a fraction
easier on balance at 404 1/2 p. Turnover was a good 6.3m.

FT  06 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAT doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tobacco and insurance group BAT Industries fell sharply yesterday in spite
of first-quarter figures well above the consensus forecast. Turnover of 4.8m
shares was unusually heavy and the stock was the most actively traded in the
options market.
The group's shares dropped 23 to 850p, after it announced a profit of Pounds
360m, up by 40 per cent and some Pounds 10m above the average expectation.
However, tobacco trading profits of Pounds 220m were slightly below last
year's first quarter, yet represented the period before US rival Philip
Morris launched a cigarette price war. Also, Pounds 46m of the gains were
purely currency-related and it transpired that the latest IRA bomb in
central London will cost BAT around Pounds 25m. SG Warburg, which has taken
a dim view of the stock recently, maintains its full-year forecast of Pounds
1,828m, but believes dividend growth might hit 8 per cent and short-term
underperformance will be countered by a rally later in the year.

FT  06 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Royal rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market was surprised at the timing, but not the substance, of the Pounds
404m rights issue which accompanied Royal Insurance's first quarter figures.
Royal has long been seen by the market as one of the prime candidates to
raise money via a rights issue, but analysts had expected the group to wait
until it had achieved profits for at least two quarters before asking its
shareholders for cash.
The deeply-discounted terms of the rights issue was generally well received
in the market, where Royal shares closed a net 9 weaker at 307p, having
fallen to 301p at one point. Turnover totalled 5.5m, the highest since
mid-March. But across the wider range of the market, the cash call unsettled
sentiment.
One leading analyst described Royal's first quarter figures as 'surprisingly
good', and said they would have been even better but for the country-wide
floods in January. He said the rights capital would enable the company to
take advantage of the opportunities caused by the shrinkage of the UK
market's underwriting capacity.
There were worries in the sector that Royal's move might be followed by a
similar fund-raising from General Accident, whose shares fell 6 to 554p.

NEWS that last month saw the highest number of net new connections to
Vodafone's cellular radio network for three years triggered a strong rise in
Vodafone shares. They closed at the end of a busy session, during which
turnover expanded rapidly to 6.3m shares, 6 higher at 380p, easily outpacing
the telecoms sub-sector and the wider market indices.
Vodafone said it was the first time since the LowCall tariff was launched
last October that new connections had exceeded net new LowCall connections.
LowCall offered subscribers cheaper monthly subscriptions charges but higher
call rates.
Analysts were impressed with the subscriber figures. Mr Marshall Whiting,
telecoms specialist at Swiss Bank Corporation, described the numbers as
'very good; but so were last month's and those of the previous month. ' He
added that Vodafone's progress had 'merely been interrupted by the
recession; the shares are a long term buy.'

FT  06 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rights issue helps to unsettle
equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES for a near term rally in UK equities were punctured yesterday when a
Pounds 404m rights issue by Royal Insurance exposed both the institutions'
lack of cash and their sensitivity to corporate news. Selling of the Footsie
futures contract quickly drove the stock market below the FT-SE 2,800 mark
so recently regained and a late rally still left the Index down by 16.1 at
2,796.5.
Concern over how long it will take before the economic recovery shows itself
in company results and dividends returned following disappointing trading
reports from, among others, BAT Industries, Trafalgar House, and Philips,
the Dutch electronics and consumer group. Although Wall Street held up well
overnight and was only 2.35 Dow points off as London closed yesterday,
worries over the apparent check in the US economic recovery continued to
plague the UK market.
However, the significant factor was again the relative lack of volume in
equity trading. The day's Seaq total improved to 539m shares from 422.8m on
the previous day. But Tuesday's retail, or customer-originated, business in
equities only just topped the Pounds 1bn mark now seen by the London
securities community as the minimum acceptable daily figure.
Equities opened lower and an attempt to rally was quickly swept aside when
the June future contract on the FT-SE Index opened. The Footsie 2,800 mark
was lost at mid-morning and further selling drove the Index down to the
day's low of 2,786.4, down 26.2.
Selling pressure fell mostly on the insurance sector as investors weighed
the implications of Royal's rights move and trading statement, which
included an estimate of Pounds 5m losses on last week's terrorist bombing in
the City of London.
But shares drifted lower across the wider range of the stock market.
Textiles and electronics were among the weaker sectors.
While some strategists took comfort from the market's success in holding in
the 2,790 area, others warned that yesterday's session showed how vulnerable
share prices are at the moment. With institutional funds heavily committed
to the sale of the remaining Government holding in BT, to the demerger of
Zeneca from ICI, and also to the monthly funding programme in UK gilt-edged
stock, there is little cash to spare.
This would leave the stock market vulnerable to any renewal of the rights
issue flow; some sector analysts fear that Royal's move could spur other
composite insurers to follow.
A slight weakening in the pound failed to help the overseas earning stocks,
whose export pricing has been threatened by sterling's firmness. Strategists
now fear that UK interest rates may not be reduced again unless the
Bundesbank opens the way by cutting German rates sharply, or unless
sterling's strength forces the UK authorities to reduce rates.
The downward pressures on the Footsie stocks imposed by selling of the
Footsie futures was matched by a setback in second line issues. The FT-SE
Mid 250 Index, which is compiled of a wide range of non-Footsie as well as
Footsie shares, fell 14.4 points to 3119.1. Trading volume in the
non-Footsie issues made up around 61 per cent of the day's total, in line
with average levels for the past few months.

FT  06 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in the derivatives markets continued flat yesterday with the futures
ominously breaching new resistance levels, writes Christopher Price.
The June contract opened at what was to be its highest level of the session
 -2,815 - before buyers moved in and the contract was quickly sold down.
Although June found some support at the 2,800-mark - a renowned technical
support level - it then proceeded to breach that to head further southwards.
Dealers said that sentiment in the futures continued largely negative, not
helped by the Royal Insurance rights issue and the feeling that the market
is short of liquidity.
June struck 2,784, its low of the day, at around lunchtime, before some
buyers began to be seen, and the contract began a slow recovery.
Even so, it never gained parity with its fair value level of around 7,
instead trading at a 3-5 point discount for most of the day.
June closed at 2,796, 23 down on the previous close and 6 points off its
fair value. Turnover was 8,195 contracts, some 250 down on the previous
session.
In the traded options market, the total turnover of 27,744 was well up on
Monday's closing figure. BAT Industries topped the stock list with 2,831
traded, followed by bid favourite United Biscuits on 2,037, Boots on 1,811
and Glaxo on 1,359.

FT  06 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Market depressed by state of
the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK prices traded in a narrow range yesterday as concern about the
state of the economy depressed market sentiment and kept many investors on
the sidelines, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.91 at 3,449.10,
having spent all day no more than a few points either side of Tuesday's
closing values. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended up 0.47 at
444.52, while the Amex composite finished 1.13 firmer at 425.89, and the
Nasdaq composite up 5.10 at 680.26. Trading volume on the NYSE was 272m
shares, and rises out numbered declines by 1096 to 769.
Economic concerns continued to overhang the markets. In spite of Tuesday's
stronger car sales, the bulk of the recent data has painted a picture of an
economy slowing down from the high rates of growth achieved at the end of
1992.
Yesterday's economic news came from the Federal Reserve, which released its
"Beige Book' report on the economy. It stated that there had been a modest
improvement in economic conditions recently, and that retail prices had
remained stable. There was little reaction to the report, primarily because
attention was focused on tomorrow's April employment figures, which will
give the most recent reading on condi tions in the all-important labour
market.
Dealers and investors were also keeping a close eye on developments in the
bond market, where prices traded erratically after the Treasury, as
expected, announced plans to change the mix of the government debt. In
future, the Treasury will sell 30-year bonds only twice, instead of four
times, a year. The difference will be made up with bigger sales of
shorter-dated govenment securities.
Cable television stocks, which jumped sharply on Tues day in the hope that
new federal regulations on the industry would not be as tough as originally
feared, fell yesterday amid profit-taking and after a leading brokerage
house, Gold man Sachs, made negative comments about the sector.
Time Warner fell Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 34 1/8 in volume of 1.9m shares,
Cablevision dropped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 30 3/4 and on the Nasdaq
market, Tele-Communications fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 19 3/4 and Comcast
slipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 19 3/8 .
ITT rose Dollars 3 to Dollars 83 3/4 on the news that it has entered an
agreement to sell its Dollars 2bn port folio of consumer loans to an
investment group led by Gold man Sachs. The purchase price of the deal was
not revealed.
Airline groups AMR fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 67 3/8 and UAL dropped
Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 133 1/2 after an analyst at Salomon Brothers
downgraded his ratings on the two stocks.
On the Nasdaq market, MCI Communications rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 48 1/8
after the company won an Dollars 80m global services con tract from banking
group JP Morgan.
Canada
TORONTO shrugged off early losses and a sell-off in New York to post
moderate gains in heavy trade. The TSE-300 closed up 7.64 points to 3,786.81
on turnover of 58.54m valued at CDollars 595.84m. Advances led declines 373
to 328.
The Consumer products and communications sectors gained favour as investors
move to expand portfolios. Consumer products were up 67.36 or 1.04 per cent,
to 6,521.47.

FT  06 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Manila's fifth
consecutive gain achieves record high
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE region's major markets were firmer yesterday. Tokyo, Bangkok and Seoul
were closed for holidays.
MANILA advanced for the fifth consecutive trading day, closing at an
all-time high on active buying. The composite index gained 17.87 to 1,654.39
in spite of profit-taking by some institutions. Traders said that the rally
was driven by lower interest rates, with local institutions moving funds to
the equity market from the treasury bill market, which is yielding 10.8 per
cent down from 14 per cent at the start of the year.
Mr Anton Periquet of Asia Equity said that the bottom for the treasury bill
yield would be the peak of the stock market. 'The rally could last another
two weeks at the most,' he said.
KUALA LUMPUR advanced marginally after a rise in some blue chip issues, amid
low volumes ahead of today's national holiday. The composite index rose 0.38
to 706.46 in volume of 359.4m shares against 430.5m. Traders said that
investors had already discounted rumours over the health of Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, which depressed share prices on Tuesday. However, aside
from short-term buying in smaller stocks by local investors, an analyst at
Kim Eng Securities in London said that he doubted whether there would be a
further rally in the market, since leading blue chip stocks look reasonably
valued.
AUSTRALIA saw a strong rise led by advances in the banking and gold sectors.
The All Ordinaries index jumped 10.4 to 1,664.3, rising for the first time
since April 26. Some traders, however, said that the gains were technical
after the declines. The gold sub-index rose 4.6 per cent to 1,492, with
Plutonic Resources up 30 cents to ADollars 4.60, while North Flinders Mines
advanced ADollars 1.30 to ADollars 8.80. Westpac advanced 11 cents to
ADollars 3.50, while Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group, which announces
its earnings on May 14, advanced 9 cents to ADollars 3.50 on speculation
that its bad debt charges would fall sharply.
NEW ZEALAND shrugged off Tuesday's 1.9 per cent fall and moved firmly ahead,
taking the NZSE-40 index 13.43 higher to 1,577.54.
Forestry shares, which bore the brunt of Tuesday's selling, recouped some of
their losses. Fletcher Challenge and Carter Holt Harvey both added 5 cents
to NZDollars 2.65 and NZDollars 2.95 respectively.
Lion Nathan, the brewer, rose 10 cents to NZDollars 3.55 after announcing
that interim profit before extraordinaries rose to NZDollars 87.4m from
NZDollars 46.0m.
TAIWAN closed mixed after late buying cut early losses, but trade remained
very sluggish. The weighted index, which was down more than 30 points at
mid-morning, ended 1.14 ahead at 4,449.32 in turnover of TDollars 22bn.
The mood was unsettled by poor April trade figures announced late on
Tuesday. But the market found support near the 4,400 level on hopes that the
central bank might ease monetary policy in the medium term, after parliament
passed a non-binding resolution requesting the central bank to cut reserve
requirements.
HONG KONG held on to small gains at the close after an afternoon rebound
from morning losses. The Hang Seng index finished 2.04 higher at 6,829.33,
after a day's high of 6,856.46. Turnover rose to HKDollars 4.54bn from
HKDollars 3.71bn.
Rumours, confirmed after the market closed, that the Sino-British Land
Commission, which regulates Hong Kong government land sales, would meet soon
brought out bargain-hunters.
Retail investors continued to switch to second and third liners, while fund
managers remained buyers of blue chips. Cheung Kong topped the most active
list, putting on 30 cents to HKDollars 26.80. HSBC Holdings was down 50
cents to HKDollars 70.50.
SINGAPORE bounced off lows to end firmer ahead of today's holiday. The
Straits Times Industrial index closed up 3.56 at 1,780.20 in volume of 162m
shares compared with Tuesday's 238m.
Sembawang Shipyard, which saw a block trade of 5m shares at SDollars 11.30,
closed 20 cents higher at SDollars 11.40 in total volume of 5.6m shares.
JAKARTA, also on holiday today, was steady in moderate trade and the
official index closed 0.30 lower at 313.61.
Astra International dropped Rp300 to Rp11,500 in spite of its rise in first
quarter profit.
BOMBAY picked up late in the session after languishing for much of the day
as speculators bought on expectations that carry forward costs after
Friday's account closure would be low. The BSE index closed 40.33 higher at
2,168.70.

FT  06 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Investors ponder a message set in gold
 -Peter Martin examines some investment themes raised by global equity
strategists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TOUR of equity markets on both sides of the Atlantic, in the company of
people paid to have opinions about them, throws up two interesting themes.
First, what is the message that the gold market is sending to investors? The
FT Gold Mines index of shares in companies that mine the metal, is up 147
per cent since its mid-January low. Gold itself has risen from Dollars 326
an ounce in mid-March to Dollars 355 an ounce, a rise of 9 per cent.
One message is that Mr George Soros, who moved into gold in a big way, has a
lot of followers in the international investment community. There are,
however, other possible reasons for taking the message from the gold market
seriously. Perhaps, says Mr David Shulman, US equity strategist at Salomon
Brothers in New York, gold is warning us of inflationary pressures ahead.
Next year, he believes, North America, Europe and Japan will all turn in
strong economic performances. This would be the first time that the three
main economic centres have been growing together since 1989.
'The risk is that there may be more pressure on the system,' he says,
'rather than less'. That makes him worried that US interest rates, at least,
may start to move higher - in spite of recent weak performance by US
economic indicators. Offsetting those, he says, may be a surprisingly strong
growth in tomorrow's US employment numbers.
Optimistic views of economic growth do not necessarily translate into
favourable assessments of the current levels of share prices, of course. In
the US, for example, Mr Shulman believes that the market is likely to drift
lower. In Europe - where the consensus view of economic growth is certainly
not an optimistic one - the valuation calculations are even more fraught.
That leads to the second big theme among strategists: the divide between
Europe's devaluers and the continent's hard-currency bloc. In general, the
economic outlook for the devaluing countries is seen as far more favourable
than for their more determined neighbours. There is room for controversy,
however, about whether share prices in devaluers such as Britain, Italy and
Scandinavia now fully reflect the likely benefits of a lower currency - or
whether, indeed, the upwards move in prices has not gone too far.
The debate is most pointed in the case of Italy, where the stock market has
outperformed the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 by 41 per cent since since last
autumn's lows, compared with 9 per cent for the UK and 30 per cent in
Sweden. This strong performance comes in spite of Italy's interlinked
political and fiscal crises.
With a government headed by a central banker, and revolutionary political
changes apparently under way, some international investors are finding Italy
still the most attractive of the devaluers.
The argument is enhanced by some more mundane arguments. Mr Nick Stevenson,
European equity strategist at Warburg Securities in London, says that
Italian companies have recently been reporting margins back at the levels of
1986-87, the period before the ERM became a semi-fixed-rate system, and
currencies like the lira started becoming heavily over-valued.
It is true, he says, that in time the competitive advantages of a devalued
currency will always be frittered away but wage restraint, of the sort now
visible in Italy and the UK, will delay that moment for years.
As a result, he says, Italian shares are very cheap by historical standards.
'We think Italian earnings are 60 per cent below trend earnings,' he says.
Though the market is selling at around 25 times earnings at the trough of
the economic cycle, the restoration of margins to trend levels would bring
down the ratio to something closer to 10.
If strategists are still bullish on some, at least, of the devaluers, they
have become increasingly gloomy about prospects for the two main
hard-currency countries, France and Germany. Mr Stevenson, for example,
points to the vulnerability of 'commodity' industrial producers in both
countries, which may take years to return to the 'normal' earnings levels of
1986-88.
Mr Michael Young, based in London as Merrill Lynch's director of European
investment strategy, says that for cyclical stocks in the D-Mark bloc, 'the
real window of vulnerability is basically the second quarter,' as companies
give up on their hopes of a second-half recovery this year. 'By the fourth
quarter at the latest, I would fully expect the market will be back to
anticipating recovery in 1994. But we've got to get from here to there.'

FT  06 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): S-E Banken rises on hopes for
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A slight easing in Germany's repo rate had no significant impact on activity
yesterday, although there were suggestions that France would soon make a
further cut in its interest rates, writes Our Markets Staff.
STOCKHOLM took the recovery theme to heart encouraged it seemed by first
quarter results from S-E Banken which showed a decline in non-performing
loans. The C shares surged to a day's high of SKr28.50 before slipping back
to close up SKr6.50 at SKr22.00 in exceptionally strong turnover. The
Affarsvarlden index rose 10.70 or 1 per cent to 1,052.10, a new year's high,
in turnover of some SKr1.5bn.
Mr David Longmuir of James Capel in London noted that a question mark
remained over the bank's recovery prospects since it still required a fresh
cash injection. Another analyst remarked that while the bank remained a high
risk play the market was of the opinion that it had turned the corner.
Mr Longmuir added that after a few weeks of drift in the market a new mood
of optimism appeared to have taken hold, encouraged also by other corporate
news. Ericsson was a case in point, gaining SKr7 in the B shares to SKr291,
after winning a contract to supply mobile telecommunications equipment to
Germany.
Stora, the forestry products group, was another to benefit, adding SKr8 or
2.6 per cent to SKr317 in the B's, on first quarter results.
AMSTERDAM was encouraged by first quarter results from Philips which came in
above expectations. The group's shares gained Fl 2.00 or 8 per cent to Fl
27.30 for a new year's high. Analysts commented that there had been a
positive meeting with the group and, while trading in Europe remained
difficult with the consumer electronics division still under pressure, the
overall picture was good.
The CBS Tendency index improved 1.00 to 108.3.
PARIS gained on light buying but overall trading remained subdued on worries
over economic prospects. The CAC-40 index rose 2.71 to 1,926.34 in turnover
of FFr1.8bn.
Peugeot, which lost ground on Tuesday on poor car sales figure for April,
rebounded FFr13 to FFr557, while Canal Plus gained FFr27 to FFr1,317 after a
rise in first quarter turnover.
FRANKFURT, however, eased in light selling, but the index recovered from its
day's lows on better than expected corporate earnings results. The DAX lost
4.21 to 1,623.16 in turnover of DM6.2bn.
An analyst at Smith New Court said that investors were starting to realise
that previous expectations for weak company profits were over-pessimistic.
A 33.7 per cent rise in 1992 group net earnings, and reports that Schering's
first quarter profit fall was less than expected, lifted sentiment. Kaufhof
rose DM15 to DM475, while Schering closed up DM15 at DM759.
MILAN turned lower, with investors hesitant ahead of today's confidence
debate on the newly-appointed government of Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi.
Miss Marie-Christine Keith of NatWest Securities in London said that the
market was, to an extent, already discounting the vote of confidence.
However, in the absence of any surprises, a 'yes' vote was likely to give
prices a modest boost.
The Comit index shed 4.48 to 541.1, taking its lead from a lower trend by
Fiat after it forecast lower net profit for 1992 and declined to give
details of dividends. The shares lost L124 to L6,726 before easing to L6,670
after-hours.
ZURICH extended early gains and the SMI index rose 6.7 to 2,166.7.
The advance was supported by a strong financial sector, benefiting from the
firm Swiss franc which was at a year's high against the D-mark. UBS bearers,
trading ex the SFr29 dividend, finished SFr18 lower at SFr919. SBC added
SFr8 to SFr345.
COPENHAGEN advanced as hopes of a positive outcome from the May 18
referendum over the Maastricht treaty spurred active buying. The KFX index
gained 0.94 or 1.1 per cent, to 87.73 in turnover of DKr754m.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Money Markets: French rates tumble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
French cash rates declined sharply again yesterday on strong speculation
that there might be another cut in France's official interest rates today or
next week, writes James Blitz.
The French franc's performance on the currency markets has been sufficiently
strong in recent days to make possible another easing in the Bank of
France's monetary policy.
At the same time, more bad news on the French economy in recent days,
including the fact that the unemployment figures have risen above 3 million,
have put pressure on the authorities to cut rates again.
Three month French francs declined sharply on this speculation yesterday,
falling from about 7.90 per cent at the start of the day to about 7.45 per
cent.
This brought 3 month French franc interest rates more-or-less in line with 3
month D-Marks.
There was a similarly bullish performance in the French franc futures
market. The June contract rose 19 basis points on the day to close at 92.62.
The September contract also closed 15 basis points higher at 93.28.
The spread between June futures in France and Germany also contracted
yesterday to about 21 basis points. In part this was due to a slightly less
bullish rise in the June Euromark contract which closed at 92.83, 4 basis
pounds up on the day.
The rise in Euromarks was partly due to a larger than expected cut in the
Bundesbank's repo rate, which came down 4 basis points to 7.71 per cent.
There had been some speculation that the rate might rise, due to the high
level of call money.
However, the Bundesbank unexpectedly drained DM2.4bn from the market in its
weekly operation.
This took dealers by surprise because the payment of a new Bund issue later
this week is expected to sap market liquidity. German call money closed
higher on the day at around 7.80 per cent.
Sterling cash markets were quiet, with 3-month money closing about 1/16 per
cent softer at 6 per cent. The Pounds 1.35bn shortage was easily removed,
helping the short-dated rates lower.
The June and September futures contracts both closed at 93.95, suggesting
that dealers may be starting to wonder about base rate cuts again.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Funds flow out of the D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK softened against most European currencies yesterday as dealers
continued to show concern about the speed with which the Bundesbank is now
easing monetary policy, writes James Blitz.
In recent days, dealers have claimed to see funds flowing out of the D-Mark
into countries whose interest rates are not dissimilar to those in Germany,
but whose fundamental economic conditions are a good deal better.
The recent fall in German bond prices was a particularly strong indication
that dealers think that the weekly cuts in German rates threaten higher
inflation.
Yesterday, the Swiss franc performed well against the German currency,
testing the SFr0.90 level against the D-Mark before closing at SFr0.897 from
a previous SFr0.902.
With 3-month D-Marks now at around 7.63 per cent, the short term rates for
the Swiss Franc, at around 5 per cent, look more attractive than they have
in the past.
The French franc also performed strongly against the D-Mark, amid
speculation that the French authorities might be able to cut their official
interest rates again.
The franc closed at FFr3.372 to the D-Mark from a previous FFr3.373.
Three-month French franc interest rates also came more-or-less in line with
3 month D-Marks, one of the clearest signs yet of the market's new-found
confidence in the French currency. Investors in the French currency had
demanded a 5 percentage point premium above D-Marks earlier this year.
Both the Belgian and Dutch currencies have also strengthened in recent days,
widening their differential above the D-Mark in the exchange rate mechanism
grid.
Last night, the Dutch guilder was some 32 basis points above the D-Mark in
the grid, compared to the Dutch government's informal band of 50 basis
points. Mr Nigel Rendell, international economist at James Capel in London,
believes the Dutch will be forced to cut rates if this trend continues.
Two currencies that profited a little less from this trend were sterling and
the Italian lira. The pound was only slightly stronger the D-Mark amid
continuing fears that the UK government may face a humiliating defeat in the
House of Commons on the Maastricht bill. The pound closed at DM2.4750 from a
previous DM2.4675.
The lira momentarily weakened after news that Moody's rating agency had
downgraded Italy's long term currency debt. However, so much bad news has
been discounted over the lira that the move down was contained. The lira
closed stronger on the day at L928.9 from a previous L933.5
The dollar was slightly stronger against the D-Mark following an unexpected
4 basis point cut in the Bundesbank's repo rate to 7.71 per cent. The dollar
closed at DM1.5780 from a previous DM1.5710.

</HEADLINE>

Last week's government package of measures helpful to Australian wool
producers facing uneconomically low prices was welcomed in the trade as a
whole but seems to have done little to improve demand. Only small-scale
orders are indicated and prices remain extremely competitive. The Australian
Wool Corporation's market indicator was 6 cents higher at 395 cents a kg. on
May 5, with finer margins gaining relatively well. The main wool market
problem of over-supply remains.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mexican silver close to
melt-down - Low prices are threatening many mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S SILVER industry is facing crisis. 'Everything you see out there is
due to silver' says Mr Raul Rodriguez Marquez, planning minister in the once
fabulously rich Mexican state of Zacatecas. 'Now, what's certain, and it's
no secret, mines are going to close.'
Mexico is the world's largest silver producer, accounting for about one
seventh of total output. But the silver industry, once the backbone of the
country's economy, with production sustaining both New and Old Spain for
more than two centuries, is now in trouble.
World silver prices tumbled from more than USDollars 50 a troy ounce in 1980
when the Hunt brothers tried to corner the market, to an average of Dollars
7 an ounce in 1987 and about Dollars 3.90 in the first quarter of this year,
though a recent recovery has since lifted it above the Dollars 4.20 mark.
Hundreds of smaller mines have already been closed or restructured, forcing
thousands out of work. Mr Jaime Lomelin of the Penoles group, the largest
silver producer in the world, reckons that no more than 20 low-cost Mexican
mines will survive the current shake-out. Given current prices, his group
has stopped exploring for more silver.
Earlier this month, the governor of the state of Zacatecas announced closure
of the mine at Real de Angeles - the largest open pit silver mine in the
world, with annual production of about 250 tonnes. With it would go some 400
to 500 jobs directly and another 800 indirectly.
Mexican mines are particularly sensitive to low silver prices because they
tend to produce silver as a primary or co-product with currently loss-making
metals such as lead or zinc, whereas, say in the US, the second largest
silver producer, mines generally extract silver as a by-product of copper,
which is still just about profitable.
Mr Jose I. Villanueva, director-general in Mexico's ministry of energy,
mines, and state industries, says: 'I think we are at the limit. A price of
around Dollars 3.60 would make any company in the world worry'. He warns
that production could crash if prices do not rise.
Until recently, the worst affected in Mexico had been the hundreds of small
mines and the individual miners who scour the landscape looking for silver
and other metallic ores. Mr Rodriguez Marquez, the head of planning, mines
and tourism in the state of Zacatecas, says in his state alone about 80 to
90 out of some 270 small mines have closed in recent years. The Penoles
group has closed down seven of its smaller mines in the past five years
while increasing production in the 11 larger, minerally richer ones.
The small mines have the highest costs, often little access to capital and
no liquidity - a bad year would put them out of business. The new satellite
technology that allows large mining companies to detect silver deposits
under the ground is rendering much of their explorative work redundant.
Up to now overall Mexican silver production has held up, thanks to greater
efficiency in the larger mines - which account for about 85 per cent of
production. Mr Lomelin says his remaining mines produce at some of the
lowest costs in the world and could survive at a silver price of Dollars
3.50 an ounce. However, with the imminent closure of Real de Angeles, the
mining ministry expects non-refined output this year to fall to 1,805
tonnes, from 2,098 last year, and 2,290 in 1991.
The mine at Real de Angeles, owned 51 per cent by Empresa Frisco of Grupo
Carso, and 49 per cent by the Canadian company Placer Dome, is closing
principally because of lower silver prices, and recent falls in prices of
the mine's by-products, zinc and lead. But after more than 10 years of
intensive exploitation, the quality of the ore has deteriorated, while the
cost of refining has increased three times, and reserves were falling.
Mr Carlos Slim, the president of Grupo Carso, says the closure is temporary,
while prices of silver and metallic bi-products remain low. The company will
continue to look for silver in the area, and Real de Angeles will be kept in
operating condition in case silver prices rise again. 'What is irrational,'
says Mr Slim, 'is to carry on taking out silver when losing money on
operations while also reducing your reserves.'
The closure will leave two neighbouring towns of Noria de Angeles and Real
de Angeles without any source of employment. 'It is going to hit us very
hard. Almost the entire population of the area worked there,' says Mr
Marquez. 'The region is not fertile, the rain is not generous and the people
are accustomed to working in just one industry.'
Among the villagers of Real de Angeles there is bitter resentment at the
treatment they have received at the hands of the government and mining
company. The village itself was moved from the old site to make way for the
mine in 1981 - but the promised riches residents felt they were going to
receive never materialised. The mine has already cut the labour force from
2,500 in 1987 to 500.
'They were supposed to compensate us,' says Mr Marco Antonio Mora, a
24-year-old who once worked at the mine. 'But what they gave us was not that
much.' The village's new houses have been built with aluminium roofs, making
them like ovens in the summer, and in place of the promised gardens and
patios is a large dusty gravel square. Many worry that the town will die
when the mine closes and, they fear, the water is cut off.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Big rise seen in European gas
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN gas market is likely to enjoy a period of sustained growth over
the next 20 years, according to a report soon to be released by Wood
MacKenzie, the Edinburgh-based energy analyst.
But while it sees annual demand growth averaging 3.1 per cent for the
present decade, it warns of a significant supply gap developing from the
mid-1990s.
WoodMac forecasts that European gas demand will rise to about 485bn cubic
metres a year in the year 2000 from 353bn cu m in 1992, fuelled by strong
demand for natural gas in the power generation sector. The proportion of gas
in use in the power generation sector is expected to rise from about 16 per
cent in 1992 to 34 per cent by 2010.
The analyst says that Germany, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands and
France will continue to dominate overall European gas demand until 2000, but
their combined share of total demand is forecast to slip to 64 per cent in
2010 from 70 per cent in 1992 as new markets like Spain and Sweden emerge.
However, WoodMac warns of a 'significant supply gap' from the mid-1990s,
which will hit 96bn cu m a year by the year 2000 and widen to 360bn cu m by
2010.
'Whilst part of this gap in the longer term can be closed by the extension
of existing supply contracts, significant new volumes of gas are required,'
it says.
'Although we consider that significant, additional indigenous production
above currently contracted levels is possible from the North Sea, the
remaining gap in supply during the late-1990s is a major concern.'
Norway, which supplied Europe with 9 per cent of its overall demand in 1992,
has considerable potential to increase gas supply but the substantial extra
investments required to upgrade gas deliverability must be justified by an
adequate return on investment.
'In this regard, the current Troll price negotiations could be crucial given
the status of the Troll contract as a benchmark for future gas supplies,'
Woodmac says.
Norway's remaining recoverable gas reserves are estimated at 2,800bn cu m,
of which some 56 per cent remains to be contracted. The pipeline capacity of
Norway's transmission system to the continent will reach 46bn cu m a year in
the mid-1990s with potential for expansion to 67bn cu m.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold demand 'up 24%' in first
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD DEMAND in markets monitored by the World Gold Council rose by 24 per
cent to 632 tonnes in the first quarter of this year compared with the same
months of 1992. The council is a promotional organisation financed by gold
producers and the markets monitored cover about 75 per cent of world demand.
This jump in demand coincided with very weak gold prices and the price
dropped to Dollars 326.15 a troy ounce on March 10, the lowest for seven
years. Prices ranged between Dollars 326 and Dollars 331 an ounce in the
quarter.
According to the council, the developing markets continued to drive gold
demand growth. In Asia first-quarter demand was up 22 per cent at 243 tonnes
and in the Middle East and India it was up 56 per cent to 203.1 tonnes.
Following liberalisation of the gold market in 1992, demand in India soared
by 93 per cent in the first quarter to 114 tonnes.
However, gold jewellery demand in the developed markets fell by 2 per cent
to 131 tonnes with a 4 per cent increase in US consumption being offset by
an 8 per cent fall in Europe while Japanese demand remained flat.

LOW ZINC prices are forcing additional production cuts to be made by
Noranda, the Canadian natural resources group, and its 50 per cent-owned
associate, Falconbridge.
In February the two companies said that output of zinc in concentrate (an
intermediate product) from their five mines in Canada would be reduced this
year from the 573,000 tonnes produced last year to 530,000 tonnes. Yesterday
they said that output would be only 500,000 tonnes.
Noranda predicted that its action, to be achieved through longer summer
shutdowns and revised mining plans, would 'make a substantial contribution
towards restoring balance in the zinc market'. The market's first reaction
was favourable and zinc for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange rose to Dollars 1,040 a tonne, traders said. But this stimulated
selling and the price closed at Dollars 1,024.25 a tonne, down Dollars 2.
'Once the market realised it was an additional cut of only 30,000 tonnes the
panic short-covering subsided,' said Mr William Adams, analyst at Rudolf
Wolff, the commodities broker. 'To put that in perspective, the last rise in
LME stocks was of 15,000 tonnes and the stocks stand at 636,800 tonnes.'
Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group,
said: 'This helps sentiment a little but, given the stocks and the outlook
for zinc, this won't turn things round'.
Zinc production cuts have been announced by several other companies. But the
recent spring meeting of the International Lead and Zinc Study Group, an
intergovernmental organisation, produced a gloomy review of prospects,
saying that output cuts in Canada and Japan this year would not fully
compensate for increases in Latin America and Korea. Also exports to the
west from the former eastern bloc countries were likely to remain
'substantial.'

ALUMINIUM closed near five-week highs on the LME in active trading,
three-month metal touching Dollars 1,169 a tonne at one stage. The market
was underpinned by speculative buying, investment fund purchases and
short-covering. Caution ahead of US labour contract expiries at the end of
this month also encouraged the market to break resistance around Dollars
1,150. COPPER moved away from its lows helped by news that El Teniente in
Chile might be closed for five days because of recent rains. Copper's
movements were largely dictated by technical factors, with May option
expiries passing without surprises. GOLD fixed at Dollars 354.25 a troy
ounce in the afternoon against Dollars 352.75 in the morning after physical
demand pushed Comex higher shortly after its opening. But they were slightly
concerned about the choppy nature of the market despite its moving to a
couple of dollars above its key Dollars 352 support level, which was tested
twice. Below this the next buffer was at Dollars 348; on the upside, Dollars
357-Dollars 358 was seen attainable this week with Dollars 360 a more
formidable task, dealers said.

LABOUR UNREST in Kerala, Southern India, has plunged rubber, tea, and coffee
plantations in the area into a crisis, with frequent strikes causing heavy
production losses.
Talks between Mr N. Ramakrishna, the state labour minister, and trade union
leaders of the Plantation Labour Committee have failed, with the committee
putting forward further demands and the government unwilling to revise
wages, saying that losses had already been suffered as a result of wage
increases worth Rs1m (Pounds 350,000) a year acceded to in February.
A single day's token strike by plantation workers agitating for increased
wages and cost of living allowances last week, resulted in production losses
of 300,000 kg of tea, and 150,000 kg of rubber, besides a loss of 450,000
working days and Rs17.8m of revenue. The Kerala state government lost Rs1.1m
by way of sales tax in a single day.
The plantation industry, Kerala's largest, employs 450,000 workers.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium depression forecast
to continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM PRICES are expected to remain depressed this year, with higher
demand offset by increased production capacity, according to the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
Unctad, which last week hosted a meeting of bauxite consumer and producing
countries, reckons that at current prices more than half the world's
aluminium capacity (excluding eastern Europe and the socialist countries of
Asia) is operating at a loss.
Unctad foresees a rise in primary aluminium production capacity of about
570,000 tonnes in 1993, broadly in line with 3 to 4 per cent growth in
demand. This, it says, implies little or no reduction in record stocks of
about 1.7m tonnes accumulated in London Metal Exchange registered
warehouses, equivalent to more than a month's global consumption of primary
aluminium.
Further cuts in capacity utilisation and closures of high-cost smelters may
be needed to avoid a complete collapse of the price this year, Unctad warns.
Aluminium prices fell from a high of about Dollars 2,100 a tonne in
September 1990 to below Dollars 1,100 a tonne late last month. That
reflected recent increases in production capacity, the steep climb in
exports from the former Soviet Union and the maintenance of output despite
low prices.
The prices of upstream products, alumina (aluminium oxide) and bauxite
(aluminium ore), have also been affected, Unctad notes. Prevailing prices
for alumina are insufficient to justify investment in new capacity, which
could restrict supply in future years, it says.
Guinea is by far the biggest bauxite exporter, followed by Brazil and
Australia. Australia is the leading exporter of alumina, while Canada, the
US and Norway head the export rankings for unwrought aluminium.
The former Soviet republics have boosted annual exports from between 200,000
and 300,000 tonnes a year to between 800,000 and 900,000 tonnes in 1991 and
1992, according to Unctad.
The increase is equivalent to about a quarter of previously estimated Soviet
consumption. Though the flood of ex-Soviet aluminium exports may abate,
Unctad believes they will still top 500,000 tonnes this year and next.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: NY coffee futures fall still
further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW YORK'S arabica coffee market was again in steep decline in late trading
yesterday as the roller-coaster ride of recent weeks continued.
The July contract was off more than 2 cents at one stage at 56.25 cents a lb
after an overnight fall of more than 5 cents. London's July robusta market
followed cautiously, trading only 300 lots in the first one and a half
hours, and closed down Dollars 29 at Dollars 860 a tonne.
Last week nearby New York prices rose by more than 9 cents after US
certified stocks fell by 100,000 bags (60 kg each). Analysts in London
yesterday suggested that the fall in the high level of stocks had been taken
as the first evidence that a widely-expected drawdown in stocks for the
1992-93 year had begun. Funds, commission houses chartists and speculators
plunged into the market.
A further fall was expected this week, but in the event US stocks rose by
15,000 bags to 5.58m bags - and last week's buyers bailed out.
'The market has been flying in the face of fundamentals,' said Mr Lawrence
Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures broker. 'People are going to
have to revise their production and consumption estimates for 1992-93.'
He believes the figures will show the market to be in balance for the season
just ended, and is expecting production to exceed consumption by 5m bags in
1993-94.
One London trader said he had been surprised at the speed of New York's
retracement on Tuesday, but the close below 60 cents a lb made it inevitable
the market would fall further. He suggested strong support between 54 and 56
cents a lb.

A RETURN to work by 16,000 Danish slaughterhouse workers is expected on
Monday following a strike over wages and working conditions that began on
April 26.
A compromise agreement was reached yesterday between the Food Workers' Union
and the employers. But before it comes into force it must be approved by a
ballot of union members over the next few days.
The stoppage, which halted meat and bacon exports, was the first in the
Danish abattoir industry for ten years. It began after collective wage
negotiations broke down and the union rejected an arbitration proposal.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: Yield gap narrows between French and
German paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE YIELD gap between the French and German government bonds broke through
the 40 basis points barrier yesterday, with the market believing that a
further cut in French interest rates was imminent.
The spread between the 8.50 per cent OAT due 2003 and the 7.125 per cent
bund due 2002 at one stage narrowed to 38 basis points and was still at 39
basis points late in the afternoon. This compares with 71 basis points just
before the French general election on March 21.
Explanations include the view that France, against the background of a
strong currency, has further scope to cut interest rates independently of
Germany. Another  1/4 point fall in the intervention rate would bring it to
8 per cent, still a little above German levels.
With France described as 'flavour of the month', some economists say the
spread could narrow to 20 basis points.
THE Bundesbank's auction of DM4.53bn of 6 3/4 per cent 10-year government
bonds was more easily absorbed than expected. The average price was 99.9,
giving a 6.76 per cent yield.
This helped the 10-year bund to gain about  1/4 point and the market was
generally stronger across the yield curve, with some backing from the strong
overnight performance of US Treasury stock.
A 4 basis point cut in the repo rate to 7.71 per cent was in line with the
re-established view that the Bundesbank will carry on with small cuts for
some time. Hope has faded that the recent larger reductions in the Lombard,
discount and repo rates heralded a run of faster, deeper cuts.
The Bundesbank Council meets today, but nothing startling was expected by
way of either comment or action.
The June futures contract opened at 94.87 and closed just over 20 basis
points higher.
MOODY'S decision to downgrade Italy's foreign currency debt sent the Italian
government bond market into a one point fall. This was contrary to the trend
in other continental markets.
The downgrade takes the rating to less than the level required by some
investors. The currency also weakened a little.
Some of the lost ground in bond prices was recovered later in the day. The
BTP contract closed less than  1/2 point lower at 96.75, still above its
level before the appointment of Mr Carlo Ciampi as prime minister - and
above the 95.50 prevailing when Moody's launched the review in mid-February.
THE UK government bond market had a quiet day, with little to give it
direction after last week's fall. A lack of economic indicators and some
caution ahead of the next gilt auction announcement were two of the factors
behind the vacuum. Caution showed through in the buying of longer-dated
index-linked gilts, pushing them up a quarter.
US TREASURY prices were mixed late yesterday after the Treasury unveiled its
long-awaited plans to cut the frequency of future long bond issues.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/8 at 104
5/16 , yielding 6.782 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was down  1/8 at 100 1/8 , to yield 3.792 per cent.
Prices fluctuated in thin trading throughout the morning as dealers and
investors speculated about the Treasury's plans to alter the composition of
its quarterly refunding round. Tuesday's news of bigger-than-expected May
bill auctions had raised expectations that the size of the May bond issue
would be cut.
The Treasury said it would reduce the May bond issue and issue 30-year bonds
only twice a year, instead of every quarter. To make up the difference, more
shorter-dated coupons and bills would be sold.

FT  06 MAY 93 / International Bonds: Council of Europe raises FFr1.6bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BORROWERS continued to flock to the French franc sector of the Eurobond
market, with yesterday's new issue activity concentrated in the seven-year
maturity sector, where there is reported to be quite healthy investor
demand.
The Council of Europe tapped the market with a FFr1.6bn, 7.25 per cent bond
due September 2000, marking its first Eurofranc issue since 1986.
Banque S. G. Warburg, the French subsidiary of S. G. Warburg, was lead
manager - an appointment which provoked some comments in the market, given
that the lead manager mandate for French franc Eurobonds is seldom award-ed
outside the main-stream French banking sector.
Market sources pointed out that the deal was swapped into yen, although S.
G. Warburg refused to confirm this, saying only that the Council of Europe
has a tendency to borrow in currencies which it on-lends or where good swap
opportunities might be available.
The bonds were priced to yield 35 basis points over the 8 1/2 per cent OAT
due 2000, and narrowed slightly to 33-34 basis points over, as market
participants pointed out that investors were keen to buy a new borrower in
the sector especially given its AA1/AA+ credit rating.
Saint-Gobain Nederland, the Dutch subsidiary of the French glass and
building materials group, also tapped the French franc sector with a FFr1bn,
seven-year deal.
The Eurobond had a coupon of 7.5 per cent and was priced to yield 60 basis
points over the relevant OAT. BNP, the lead manager, said the spread widened
out to 64 basis points.
The Eurofranc sector has proved a popular area of the Eurobond market for
borrowers since the start of the year. The Kingdom of Spain launched a
FFr6bn, 15-year issue late on Tuesday which dealers said was quite well
received - the spread over the relevant OAT widened from 44 basis points at
launch to 45-46 basis points yesterday.
Both the Eurosterling and Eurolira sectors saw new issuance yesterday. GECC
launched a Pounds 100m five-year deal with a coupon of 7.5 per cent which
was swapped into floating-rate French francs.
Deutsche Bank Finance and KfW International Finance both tapped the Eurolira
sector with L200bn and L75bn five-year deals respectively. Deutsche Bank
claimed the Eurolira sector held up 'reasonably well' despite Moody's
downgrading of Italy's credit rating.
Market participants said that they expect to see the launch of a IPounds 75m
deal for the European Investment Bank shortly.
News America Holdings, part of News Corp, has filed to register Dollars
1.5bn of liquid yield option notes for possible future sales by holders who
bought them from the company in March.

investor profile

<TEXT>
BANESTO, the Spanish commercial bank, wrongly identified one the main
investors in the planned Dollars 457m rights issue it announced on Tuesday.
Banesto's press release said 'General Electric, which has a Triple A rating,
has undertaken to invest Dollars 25m' in the issue. It later confirmed that
the US financial institution was, in fact, GE Capital.
A statement issued yesterday by JP Morgan, the US bank co-ordinating
Banesto's bid to raise a total of Dollars 1.2bn in fresh capital, said the
actual investor was GE Pension Trust, GEPT, which manages as a fiduciary the
pension funds of GE employees.
GEPT, which has its own independent investment activity, is a passive
participant in the so-called Corsair Fund, a portfolio managed by JP Morgan
which is investing Dollars 200m in Banesto's rights issue.

FT  06 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Italian downgrade squeezes
foreign investor base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE REPUBLIC of Italy's foreign currency debt rating has been lowered from
Aa3 to A1 by Moody's, following a review by the US rating agency, but the
decision is not expected to halt the Republic's plans to tap the global bond
market.
Italian officials have been considering a dollar-denominated global bond for
some months, but were waiting for the result of the Moody's review,
announced in March.
However, the reduction means that the potential investor base for Italian
debt will shrink, as some fund managers cannot buy debt rated below AA.
Italy's foreign debt is still rated AA by Standard &amp; Poor's, which is widely
viewed as less aggressive in its policy than Moody's.
Dealers do not expect Italy's funding costs in the global bond market to
rise further as a result of the downgrade, but the potential size of the
issue may have to be reduced.
Italy is expected to raise roughly Dollars 10bn-Dollars 15bn in the
international capital markets this year, of which it has already issued
about Dollars 3.5bn.
Dealers said the downgrade had been largely discounted. In the dollar
market, Italy's 8 3/4 per cent Eurobonds due 2001 widened from 100 to 107
basis points over the comparable US Treasury yield following the
announcement.
After the poor performance of Italy's debt at the end of last year, yield
spreads widened dramatically and only steadied when the debt started to be
asset-swapped.
This means that, unlike most high-quality debt, gauged in terms of its yield
spread above the relevant government bond, it is treated as a high-yielding
floating-rate asset, viewed in terms of the margin over Libor produced by
asset-swapping. In these terms, Italy's Eurobonds are trading at 50 basis
points above Libor.
The downgrade came a day before Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, former governor of
the Bank of Italy, was due to present as prime minister his government's
political and economic programme. Mr Ciampi is likely to use Moody's
decision to underline the need for parliament to back continued austerity.
Moody's said that the new government is committed to controlling the bloated
public sector deficit, but 'the continuing uncertainty regarding the ability
of future governments to maintain the required austerity over an extended
period of time is higher than appropriate for a AA rating'.
The out-going Amato government has already laid the basis for a L13,000bn
mini-budget to correct a projected overshoot in spending in the 1993 budget
and made plans for the 1994 budget to be drawn up by July. Mr Ciampi is
expected to repeat these pledges and outline details on privatisation in
order to recoup international credibility.
Mr Ciampi was chosen as a non-parliamentarian to head Italy's 52nd post-war
government, in part because of his clear identification to a commitment to
fiscal austerity and improving Italy's public finances.
Moody's also lowered the foreign currency debt ratings of Istituto Bancario
San Paolo di Torino, Crediop, Banca Nationale del Lavoro, Banca Commerciale
Italiana, Credito Italiano, Cassa di Risparmio di Torino, Cariplo and IMI to
A1.
Mercato Italiano Futures, the Italian screen-based futures exchange, plans
to introduce new mechanisms for trading the spreads between different
contracts.
A calendar spread page, allowing investors to roll over from one contract
month to the next, will be introduced on May 20. This will reduce the cost
of rolling over contracts, which was previously more expensive than on the
London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange.
A second spread page, allowing investors to trade the spread between the
five and 10-year Italian government bond contracts, will be introduced at a
later date.

ELF-SANOFI, the French pharmaceuticals company, plans to sell the

Tessile Miroglio, the Italian textile group, for an undisclosed sum, writes
Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
The disposal is the latest in a number of deals conducted by Elf-Sanofi,
which is controlled by the Elf-Aquitaine oil company, notably its
controversial acquisition earlier this year of the Yves Saint-Laurent
fashion and cosmetics house.
The Yves Rocher clothing business, which includes the Claverie and Sym
labels, will be merged under Miroglio's ownership to create a company with
combined sales of about FFr300m (Dollars 55.5m).
Miroglio has significant clothing interests in France, including the
Caroline Rohmer business which it acquired six years ago, as well as
operations in Spain and Germany.

FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: Fiat chief sees profit of L500bn
for year
</HEADLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIAT, Italy's biggest private company, will report net profits of about
L500bn (Dollars 340m) for 1992, according to Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman,
The news came against figures which showed sales of new cars in Italy had
plunged by 28.1 per cent in April, one of the steepest declines on record.
The sales fall, which follows a drop of almost 21 per cent in March, is
likely to prompt a lowering in expectations for Fiat earnings for this year
and will fuel tensions between the group and Japanese importers, notably
Nissan, which have been raising their market shares.
Earlier this year, Mr Agnelli described the year ahead as being 'critical'
for the Fiat group.
Mr Agnelli gave no indication of Fiat's dividend, to be revealed, along with
official earnings figures, after a board meeting on May 31.
In 1991, net profits after minority interests dropped by more than 30 per
cent to L1,114bn while the dividend was slashed by 37 per cent to L230 for
each ordinary share.
In spite of the poor outlook, Fiat's share price has been rising strongly on
speculative buying based on rumours of an alliance with Renault of France.
Both companies have consistently denied the rumours.

HEWLETT-Packard has introduced a pocket-sized personal computer that can
send and receive electronic messages as well as run standard PC programs.
It is one of the first products to reach the market in what is expected to
become a fast-expanding market for 'personal communicators'.
The 100LX is H-P's second palmtop computer.
It has already sold 'well over 200,000' of the earlier version, which was
introduced two years ago, and which does not have the built-in
communications capabilities of the new model.
H-P has taken an early lead in a field that is expected to expand rapidly
with the entrance of competitors such as Apple Computer, with its much
heralded Newton, as well as AT&amp;T, IBM and Compaq Computer.

<TEXT>
PLACER DOME, the international gold producer based in Vancouver, has
reported unchanged first-quarter earnings, with lower costs and taxes
offsetting a 2 per cent fall in output and a 7 per cent drop in the bullion
price.
Earnings both this year and last were USDollars 11m, or 5 cents a share,
while revenues fell to Dollars 228m from Dollars 267m. Tax provisions
dropped to Dollars 6m from Dollars 19m.
Placer's share of gold output from its 14 mines dipped to 450,000 oz from
460,000 oz, due mainly to lower ore grades at the Porgera and Misima mines
in Papua New Guinea.
But production at the Campbell mine in Ontario rose to 70,500 oz from 59,500
oz.
Average cash production costs fell to Dollars 192 an ounce. Improvements at
nine mines were due to higher grades, tighter cost controls and favourable
exchange rate movements.
Placer expects output from its Australian and Papua New Guinea operations
this year to be about 20 per cent below 1992. Lower grades will continue to
hit production at Porgera and Misima. Furthermore, Placer has reduced its
stake in Porgera, and last year sold the Big Bell mine in Australia.
The company said it had completed a feasibility study for a 4,600
tons-per-day open pit mine and processing plant to exploit its 60 per
cent-owned Pipeline deposit in Nevada.
Recoverable ore reserves are estimated at 35.3m tons with a grade of 0.12 oz
of gold per ton. Construction costs are estimated at Dollars 250m.

FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: KeyCorp laughs all the way to
the bank - The 'bar-bell' expansion which defied conventional wisdom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRAZY. That was the verdict Wall Street delivered in the mid-1980s on Mr
Victor Riley, chief executive of KeyCorp, then a modest-sized bank in
up-state New York, when he began snapping up banks in Alaska, Oregon and
Washington.
The deals defied conventional wisdom that US banks should acquire others in
their own or neighbouring regions.
The pundits said KeyCorp would find it very hard to manage a business with
two entirely separate clusters of operation in the extreme north-east of the
US and the extreme north-west.
Eight years on, however, it is Mr Riley who is laughing. So, too, may be
KeyCorp's long-time British institutional investors who, he says, supported
his bold move into the Pacific north-west 'when Wall Street was calling us
lunatic.
'Many of the Scottish folks told us: 'Right on, you're doing the right
thing,' ' he recalls with a chuckle.
For a rapid succession of well-priced, strategically bold takeovers has
given KeyCorp operations in eight northern states and a reputation as one of
the more adept US 'super-regional' banks at profiting from the wave of
consolidation sweeping through the American industry.
From its base in Albany, New York, it has lifted assets from just Dollars
3bn in 1982 to around Dollars 32bn - a figure which includes the completion
in January of one of its most important acquisitions yet  - Washington
state's Dollars 4.8bn-asset Puget Sound Bancorp.
It recently unveiled plans to build up assets to around Dollars 50bn by
1995-1997, while increasing earnings per share 13 per cent a year and
improving its return on equity from 16.48 per cent to 17 per cent.
Details will be spelt out for European investors next week when Mr Riley
embarks on an annual tour of the region's financial centres.
A big, broad-shouldered man of 61, with an infectious laugh, he took over as
chief executive in 1973, which makes him the longest-serving leader of a
leading US bank.
He spends some 50 per cent of his time on the road, visiting branches of
KeyCorp's far-flung empire or giving presentations issues in small, rural
towns.
His unusual working schedule reflects what makes KeyCorp distinct from its
rivals:
It is the only regional bank with branches on both sides of the US, with
roughly 50 per cent of assets in the Pacific north-west and Rocky Mountain
states and the remainder in the north-east. This has been dubbed a
'bar-bells' strategy, since the bank has no presence in the middle of the
country.
It concentrates on predominantly small town and rural markets, with branches
in such obscure corners of the US as Eagle River, Alaska, Big Piney,
Wyoming, and Caribou, Maine.
And it has remained very much a community bank, with lending decisions taken
by local officers.
All this helped keep KeyCorp growing strongly in the early 1990s, when many
US banks stumbled because of regional recession or serious exposure to a
collapsing commercial property market.
Its geographical diversity has been a source of strength, for while the
north-eastern economy has been through a severe downturn, the Pacific
north-west was - at least until recently - one of the fastest-growing
regions of the US.
Banking margins in rural America are high, while KeyCorp's conservative
lending practices mean its ratio of non-performing assets to loans and
repossessed real estate is a very low 1.80 per cent.
But what can KeyCorp do for an encore - particularly when the interest rate
cycle seems to be turning against the banking industry, trimming the easy
profits earned by the sector over the past year, and when growth in loan
volume is likely to be sluggish?
Its five-year plan has three elements. First, to broaden and improve its
banking services, and make their delivery more efficient.
In the past KeyCorp had a relatively high ratio of overheads to revenue  -
in part because of its geographical spread - but it has driven this down
from around 72 per cent five years ago to around 62 per cent, just below its
peer group average, and the aim is to cut it to 57 per cent.
Technology will be an important factor here. KeyCorp has recently completed
the installation of a sophisticated computer network linking every
bank-teller. 'We can tell you at the end of every day the loans that have
been put out on our system,' says Mr Riley.
The bank is now moving into electronic imaging for cheque processing and
hopes to sell this service to other businesses which involve a lot of
paperwork.
Technology is meant to play an important role in the bank's second objective
 -to boost its fee-based income from services such as mortgage banking
(where it is already a substantial player, with a portfolio of over Dollars
20bn), insurance and trust services.
Bank-tellers will be encouraged to cross-sell these other products - and
earn commission doing so - by using their computer terminals.
The third objective is to keep up KeyCorp's acquisitions, which Mr Riley
thinks could account for about one third of its earnings growth over the
next few years.
The emphasis, says Mr Bill Dougherty, the chief financial officer, will be
on filling in gaps in the states it serves, together with moves into
contiguous ones 'provided we can get a major market share.'
There are risks, perhaps reflected in the fact that Wall Street has kept
KeyCorp's P/E ratio below the best in its peer group.
The economy of the Pacific north-west is slowing as aerospace recession hits
Seattle-based Boeing. But KeyCorp argues that Boeing is not the crucial
factor in the regional economy it once was, and it points out that states
like Utah and Idaho are booming.
Second, the bank could make a poor acquisition - although its shrewd record
to date suggests the contrary.
Third, the leadership could change: Mr Dougherty will probably retire in
1994 and Mr Riley could quit the following year, although he will only say:
'The day that I'm just not excited getting up and coming in to work is the
day I'm going to tell the board I'm ready to retire.'
Judging by his busy European schedule, that is still a long way off.

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
METRA, the Finnish industrial conglomerate, returned to the black in the
year to February, helped by a strong performance from the diesel engine
division, restructuring and a weaker markka.
Profit after financial items amounted to FM43m (Dollars 7.94m), compared
with a FM203m deficit previously. The dividend is being held at FM2 per
share.
Sales rose 7 per cent to FM10.5bn, with the biggest improvement coming from
Wartsila Diesel, where sales grew to FM5.1bn from FM3.3bn.
The group has benefited from a strong increase in power plant sales, and in
particular from the popularity of plants with a multi-fuel burning
capability. It is the world's leading supplier of diesel power plants of
more than 1Mw, with a 20 per cent market share, but it has also maintained a
strong presence in the marine engine market despite a lower level of world
shipbuilding orders.
Wartsila Diesel lifted operating profits to FM285m from FM177m, as the
unit's order intake climbed to FM3.5bn from FM1.7bn.
Metra said it had benefited from its reduced exposure to the depressed
Finnish construction market following last year's disposal of its building
materials activities. It retains a small involvement in this sector via
associate companies.
A further improvement is expected in the group's performance this year, with
sales predicted to reach FM10bn in the months from March to December 1993.

RELIANCE Industries, the Indian chemicals and textiles conglomerate,
reported a 96 per cent increase in net profits to Rs32.1bn (Dollars 1.03bn)
for the year to March 1993.
The company, which last year became the first Indian group to tap the
international markets for fresh equity, says sales jumped 39 per cent to
Rs41.05bn. Operating profits increased by 53 per cent to Rs88.2bn. Exports
increased to Rs16.8bn, up 62 per cent.
Mr Anil Ambani, joint managing director, said Reliance, the fifth-biggest
industrial group in India, had achieved the result in a 'difficult
environment further aggravated by dumping' from foreign chemicals producers
who were off-loading their products in India.

<TEXT>
LION Nathan, Australia and New Zealand's biggest brewer, expects
satisfactory profits this year but says tougher competition and difficult
trading conditions in the Australian beer market will be a challenge.
For the six months to February, group profits rose by 72.8 per cent to
NZDollars 79.5m (USDollars 42.9m) from NZDollars 46m a year earlier.
However, the 1992 result included a six-month contribution from the then 50
per cent owned National Brewing, now fully-owned and known as Lion Nathan
Australia.
The company is stepping up its interim dividend by 1 cent a share to 6.5
cents.
Mr Douglas Myers, chief executive, said yesterday the company had lost 3.6
per cent of its key market share in New South Wales on the same period of
last year, but increased it in Queensland, South Australia and Vic-toria.
Over the past 12 months, Lion Nathan's share of the Australian beer market
was up 1.7 per cent to 40.7 per cent. 'We are ahead of last year but the
rate of increase has fallen away,' Mr Myers said. Beer market share in New
Zealand was 58.2 per cent.
Turnover for the six months rose 136 per cent to NZDollars 1.3bn. The
half-year results include extraordinary losses of NZDollars 9.4m and a
NZDollars 20m provision for property investment losses. There was a tax
credit of NZDollars 6m, against tax paid last time of NZDollars 1m.
Mr Myers said the newly-launched Toohey's Blue Label low-alcohol beer had
become the top-selling beer in Australia. Lion Nathan International
increased exports by 25 per cent with US sales up 37 per cent.
Losses from the soft drinks division were reduced to NZDollars 6.7m from
NZDollars 7.9m on sales up at NZDollars 112.6m from NZDollars 85.3m.
Mr Myers saw the formation of the joint venture with PepsiCo of the US
covering both Australia and New Zealand as a 'great growth opportunity'.
Group trading profit before interest and tax was NZDollars 197.4m, against
NZDollars 97.6m. Interest costs were NZDollars 115.6m, up from Dollars 50.8m
for the first half of last year.

<TEXT>
CANADIAN Pacific, the transport, resource and property group, returned to
profitability in the first quarter with the help of special gains.
But Mr William Stinson, chairman, told the annual meeting the results were
'disappointing,' despite two years of radical restructuring of the company.
'However, the improvement in our share price to around CDollars 21 from a
52-week low of CDollars 13 1/2 reflects the group's future potential. I am
very optimistic as we come out of the long recession,' he said
He added that CP was improving its competitive position in all subsidiaries.
The company had a good cash position, although consolid-ated debt was still
too high.
Improving operating results through the year, increasing cash-flow and the
impact of the sale of non-core assets would strengthen the balance sheet
significantly.
Final first-quarter profit was CDollars 21.7m (USDollars 17.1m), or 7 cents
a share, against a loss of CDollars 39.7m, or 12 cents, a year earlier.
Total revenues were CDollars 1.9bn, down from CDollars 2.4bn, reflecting
de-consolidation of interests in Unitel, the telecommunications group, and
in United Dominion, its industrial products associate. Transportation,
including the railway, contributed lower income, but 87 per cent owned
PanCanadian, the oil and gas arm, reported operating income double that of
the 1992 period. Property and hotels gained slightly and forest products
narrowed losses.
On an operating basis, Canadian Pacific reported overall income of CDollars
94.1m, against CDollars 61.4m.
Mr Stinson said lower coal, wheat, sulphur and car traffic more than offset
gains in potash, wood products and steel as well as inter-modal traffic.
Ships made a positive contribution while the truck side reduced losses.
'We expect overall operating performance to improve gradually throughout
1993,' Mr Stinson said.

BSN, the French food group, is expanding its North American interests by
buying Aliments Delisle, a privately-owned Canadian dairy products company.
The deal, for an undisclosed sum, turns BSN into the largest player in the
Canadian yoghurt market. Aliments Delisle, which made sales of FFr300m
(Dollars 56.6m) last year, makes cheese, cream and yoghurt under the
Silhouette and Delisle brand names.
BSN, a force in the European food industry which last year played a pivotal
part in the bitter takeover battle for Perrier mineral water, is already
present in the North American yoghurt market through the Danone brand in the
US and the Danone label in Mexico.
Fresh food, including dairy products, was one of BSN's strongest areas of
activity last year. The group saw overall net profits before exceptional
items rise by 5.6 per cent from FFr3.44bn in 1991 to FFr3.64bn in 1992 on
sales of FFr70.84bn.
Generale des Eaux, the French utilities group, may expand in Portugal by
investing in the water, telecommunications and transport industries after
privatisation, Mr Paul-Louis Girardot, chief executive, said in Lisbon

FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: BT talks on share stake in EDS
are called off
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecom and Electronic Data Systems, America's largest computing
services company, are understood to have called off discussions which could
have meant BT buying a large stake in EDS, a subsidiary of General Motors.
The two companies declined to comment but they are believed to have been
unable to agree on the financial terms of a deal, and particularly on the
degree of control to be wielded by BT.
The British company does not want to take stakes in businesses where it does
not have control, while neither GM nor EDS appear to have been happy to
yield much power to BT.
The discussions are said to have included the possibility of BT purchasing a
25 per cent stake in GM's class E shares, which are linked to the
profitability of EDS. This would have cost BT around Dollars 4bn at current
market prices.
However, the class E shares do not give the holder a stake in EDS's assets,
which remain 100 per cent owned by GM, and this appears to have been a
significant stumbling block to any deal.
The termination of talks poses a substantial strategic challenge for BT,
which is anxious to expand its presence in the North American telecoms
market, the world's largest, to support its drive to be a leading global
business.
It has a fledgling network management business, called Syncordia, based in
Atlanta, Georgia, but a tie-up with EDS would have given it much more clout
in the US market and potential access to customers.
EDS, for its part, could have bolstered its European presence through a link
with BT.
The Dallas-based company, which operates in more than 30 countries, sees
Europe as a key area of growth over the coming decade. Some 25 per cent of
its revenues currently come from international markets.
It is keen to strike up alliances with one or more international
telecommunications groups to exploit the convergence of the computing and
telecommunications sectors in a much larger information technology industry.

FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: SEC seeks comment on capital
rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Securities and Exchange Commission has voted to ask for public
comment on whether it should broaden the capital requirements for securities
firms to include their exposure to derivative securities.
The move is the latest expression of concern by US and international
regulators about the fast-growing, extremely profitable and largely
unregulated market for derivative instruments such as forwards and swaps.
Only last week, the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision proposed new
minimum capital levels for banks which trade equities, debt, foreign
exchange and derivatives.
The SEC is at this stage only seeking comment on ways in which it could
change its capital rules to encompass derivatives, but any eventual action
could have serious repercussions for the market.
The SEC only gained the power to oversee the derivates business last year
when, following the 1990 collapse of securities house Drexel Burnham
Lambert, it won the right examine the affiliates of securities houses
dealing in the instruments.

HORSHAM Corp said yesterday a strengthening US economy would improve margins
at its wholly-owned Clark Oil &amp; Refining subsidiary this year. In addition,
retail volumes were showing gains monthly.
Horsham, a holding company controlled by Canadian entrepreneur Mr Peter
Munk, owns 20 per cent of American Barrick Resources.
First-quarter net profit was USDollars 6.8m, including special items, or 8
cents a share, against Dollars 8.2m, or 9 cents, a year earlier. Revenues
were Dollars 591m, against Dollars 502m last time.
Clark Oil, a US refiner and marketer, suffered a small loss, while the
contribution from American Barrick doubled to Dollars 9m.

new share class

   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SMH, the leading Swiss watchmaking group, said it would split its registered
shares and convert its participation certificates into a new class of bearer
share.
However, it would maintain restrictions on foreign ownership to ensure that
the Swiss identity of the group and its products - which include such famous
brands as Swatch, Omega, Longines, Tissot and Rado - would be preserved.
The group plans to split each SFr100 registered share into five SFr10
registered shares plus one new SFr50 bearer share.
Each SFr20 registered share will be split into two SFr10 registered shares.
Each SFr100 participation certificate will be converted into two SFr50
bearer shares.
The new bearer and registered shares would each have one vote per share. The
pool of Swiss shareholders led by Mr Nicolas Hayek, which has 52 per cent of
the votes, will probably see their voting power decline fractionally.
Mr Hayek said the proportion of foreign ownership of the group was probably
over 40 per cent. But the by-laws provide that foreigners as a group can
vote only 30 per cent of the registered shares and, as individuals, can only
vote 3 per cent.
Motor-Columbus, the electrical technology group controlled by Union Bank of
Switzerland, plunged into a loss of SFr182m last year, compared with a
profit of SFr65m in 1991, and the directors proposed passing the dividend.

FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: Canadian Pacific returns to
profit in first quarter
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL, TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN Pacific, the transport, resource and property group, returned to
profitability in the first quarter with the help of special gains.
But Mr William Stinson, chairman, told the annual meeting the results were
'disappointing', despite two years of radical restructuring of the company.
'However, the improvement in our share price to around CDollars 21 from a
52-week low of CDollars 13 1/2 reflects the group's future potential. I am
very optimistic as we come out of the long recession,' he said
He added that CP was improving its competitive position in all subsidiaries.
The company had a good cash position, although consolid-ated debt was still
too high.
Improving operating results through the year, increasing cash-flow and the
impact of the sale of non-core assets would strengthen the balance sheet
significantly.
Final first-quarter profit was CDollars 21.7m (USDollars 17.1m), or 7 cents
a share, against a loss of CDollars 39.7m, or 12 cents, a year earlier.
Total revenues were CDollars 1.9bn, down from CDollars 2.4bn, reflecting
de-consolidation of interests in Unitel, the telecommunications group, and
in United Dominion, its industrial products associate.
Transportation, including the railway, contributed lower income, but 87 per
cent owned PanCanadian, the oil and gas arm, reported operating income
double that of the 1992 period.
Property and hotels gained slightly and forest products narrowed losses.
On an operating basis, Canadian Pacific reported overall income of CDollars
94.1m, against CDollars 61.4m.
Mr Stinson said lower coal, wheat, sulphur and car traffic more than offset
gains in potash, wood products and steel as well as inter-modal traffic.
George Weston, the Canadian foods group, said that while earnings from the
last few quarters had been disappointing, it saw a substantial improvement
in sales and earnings for the remainder of 1993, Reuter reports from
Toronto.
George Weston reported net earnings of CDollars 11.1m, orCDollars 0.24 per
share, in the first quarter of 1993, compared with CDollars 6.1m, or
CDollars 0.09.

FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: Intel shares rise sharply on IBM
link-up reports
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTEL shares have risen sharply this week amid reports that the
semiconductor manufacturer was in talks with International Business Machines
about a possible manufacturing alliance.
Intel, the leading manufacturer of microprocessor chips used in personal
computers, is unable to fulfil strong demand for its latest products. IBM,
in contrast, has excess production capacity.
Wall Street analysts speculated that the companies might come to an
arrangement that would solve both of their problems. IBM is Intel's largest
customer, and a long-time ally.
IBM already manufacturers, under licence, Intel-designed microprocessors.
However, the current terms of that licensing arrangement limit IBM's
production to chips for use in its own products, or for sale in
'sub-systems', such as computer circuit boards.
One possibility is that the licensing arrangement could be modified to
enable IBM to manufacture microprocessors for sale to third parties.
Analysts also suggested, however, that Intel might acquire a share of IBM's
semiconductor production facility in East Fishkill, New York.
A spokesman for Intel said the company had frequent discussions with IBM,
but would not disclose the nature of those talks. IBM also declined comment.
Intel's stock gained Dollars 4 3/8 on Tuesday and a further Dollars 1/8
yesterday, closing at Dollars 101 1/2 having earlier touched Dollars 102
1/8.

FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: ITT to sell consumer loan
portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITT, the US conglomerate, yesterday speeded up the re-orientation of its
troubled Consumer Financial Corporation subsidiary by announcing plans to
sell a poorly-performing loan portfolio. It intends selling its domestic
unsecured consumer small loan portfolio to an investment group.
The investment group is led by an affiliate of Goldman, Sachs, the New York
investment bank, and includes ITT, with a 15 per cent equity holding, and
Household International, the credit servicing company, with a 25 per cent
stake. Household will service the loan portfolio.
The portfolio had an end-February face value of Dollars 2.18bn. ITT, which
expects to report a small gain on the sale in the second quarter, will
receive around Dollars 1.7bn in cash, including Dollars 400m of loan payment
collections between the end of February and the June 1 completion of the
deal.
The deal follows ITT's announcement last January that it was changing the
focus of the consumer finance business, away from the domestic unsecured
area, which has been hit by the growing popularity of credit cards and the
increasing willingness of Americans to file for personal bankruptcy.
The unit plans to focus on secured lending, particularly in the mortgage
field.
At the time of the January announcement, ITT established reserves of Dollars
796m to cover losses from the run-off of the unsecured portfolio and office
closures.
The portfolio was written down to 65 cents on the dollar, but yesterday's
agreement puts a price on it of just over 79 cents.
Mr Rand Araskog, ITT's chairman, said the transaction 'maximises the
shareholder value of the loan portfolio through sale rather than
liquidation.' Shares in ITT rose on the New York Stock Exchange following
the announcement, closing Dollars 3 higher on the day at Dollars 83 3/4.

MARION Merrell Dow, the US pharmaceuticals company 70 per cent owned by Dow
Chemical, plans to cut US staffing levels and reduce costs, writes Our New
York Staff.
The company, which last month reported sharply lower sales and earnings for
the first quarter of 1993, also plans to accelerate projects it believes
will help sales in the near term.
Mr Fred Lyons, president and chief executive officer, said the company was
facing very tough business conditions.
'While our vision remains focused on long-term growth, we clearly need to
realign our organisation to reflect current business conditions, he said.
'With sales and earnings for 1993 running well below 1992 levels, we cannot
take a 'business-as-usual' approach.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SAFEWAY, one of the largest US food retailers with more than 1,100 stores in
the US and Canada, yesterday reported a Dollars 1.7m loss after tax in the
three months to March 27, compared with a Dollars 22.9m surplus, before
extraordinary items, in the same period of 1992.
Sales during the period edged ahead from Dollars 3.39bn to Dollars 3.4bn.
Operating profits fell from Dollars 102.4m to Dollars 42.3m, while interest
expenses decreased from Dollars 70.3m to Dollars 63.2m. Safeway was subject
to a Dollars 4.2bn leveraged buy-out in 1986, and remains fairly heavily
indebted.
The California-based company blamed the loss on its problems in Alberta.
Low-cost competitors have undermined Safeway's position there, and the US
company has negotiated a new contract with local employees which rolls back
wages and provides a voluntary buy-out programme.
Safeway said yesterday that the number of employees accepting the buy-out by
April 30 'far exceeded expectations'.
However, the first quarter figures included a Dollars 27.5m charge, after
tax, to cover the buy-out programme. The company also cut prices sharply in
Alberta - a move which boosted first-quarter sales but hit operating
margins.

FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: Mannesmann knocked by telephone
network costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MANNESMANN, the German engineering group, yesterday said that profits on
continuing operations dropped by almost a half to DM339m (Dollars 212m) from
DM625m last year. This was about a third of the DM1bn net profits which the
group made in 1990. At the parent company, net profits dropped to DM244m
from DM389m.
Mannesmann blamed the drop in profits on the costs of setting up its mobile
telephone network. It said it would cut its dividend from the DM9 per share
paid in 1991 to DM6. As already announced, turnover rose to DM28bn last year
from DM24.3bn in 1991.
Mannesmann said that the costs of developing the telephone network were
DM340m last year, up from DM235m in the previous year. Further details were
not disclosed, but the group has said that its steel tubes, trading and
vehicles components divisions were all loss-making last year.
The engineering and plant business made profits, while earnings from
electrical and electronic engineering were unchanged.
The figures benefited from a return to profitability at the group's
Brazilian operations which had been in deficit for two years. The group's
total order intake rose to DM27.8bn from DM25.3bn.
The steep fall in profits reflects the worldwide fall in demand for capital
goods as well as the German recession. Analysts criticised the company's
aggressive move into the troubled car components sector. VDO Adolf
Schindling, the components company bought in October 1991, this week
announced it would be shedding 1,300 out of 8,300 jobs this year and would
make substantial losses.
Mannesmann's shares fell DM2.30 to close at DM249.20.
Kaufhof Holding, one of Germany's biggest retailing groups, reported that
profits rose by more than a third last year to DM222.4m. Turnover rose by
14.7 per cent to DM20.5bn.
The group is proposing to pay an unchanged dividend of DM12 for each
ordinary share and DM13 on its preference shares. Kaufhof gave no reasons
for the profits expansion but in February attributed it to a strategy of
expanding into high-growth niche markets, reducing its dependence on
department stores.

Klockner-Werke

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KLOCKNER-WERKE, the German steel and engineering group, yesterday won a
reprieve from outright bankruptcy when the European Commission decided not
to demand immediate full repayment of its DM175m (Dollars 111.4m) loan to
the group.
But the company must still satisfy the commission that planned capacity cuts
and restructuring will not distort overall EC plans to support the European
steel industry.
Klockner said yesterday the way was now open for its debt relief scheme to
go through. It said all main creditors had endorsed its debt rescheduling
deal under which DM1.4bn of the groups's DM2.7bn net debt would be written
off. 'The last hurdle is removed,' a spokesman added.
But a senior commission official said: 'That is wrong. Today we said 'Yes,
but' and we are waiting for the answer to our 'but'.'
In Duisburg, the local court yesterday gave a green light to the company's
plan by formally opening the 'composition' procedure. The procedure, a legal
step which falls short of bankruptcy proceedings, allows Klockner to write
off over 50 per cent of its debt once all creditors have accepted it.
Creditors are due to meet on June 7 to review the plan, the company said.
Klockner's largest creditors are Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank and
Westdeutsche Landesbank, the state bank for North-Rhine Westphalia.
Brussels, which does not want to encourage debt write-offs at other ailing
European steel manufacturers, is seeking rapid clarification of the cuts
involved in Klockner's restructuring. Klockner itself believes the
commission will be satisfied with its plans to reduce crude steel production
by 20 per cent this year with a blast furnace in Bremen set for closure.
Further cuts are also planned for the lossmaking Edelstahl, Klockner's
special steels division. The company is to be sold for a symbolic DM2 to Mr
Jurgen Grossmann, chairman of the subsidiary until February 15. Druker, a
Frankfurt-based consultancy company, will acquire 25 per cent of the shares.

PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, said net profit fell by 36 per cent to
Fl 103m (Dollars 57.9m) in the first quarter, largely as the result of a
sharp decline in its communications systems business.
In spite of the fall in overall profit, yesterday's figures showed that
operating losses in Philips' consumer electronics, its biggest and most
important business, had stabilised, while two other businesses - lighting
and semi-conductors - had posted operating profit rises of 10 per cent and
67 per cent, respectively.
However, the group's fourth business, professional products, was hit hard by
the sharp reversal in the fortunes of communication systems. A drop in
orders from Germany's telecommunications authorities helped push the sector
into an operating loss of Fl 9m from a profit of Fl 128m the year before.
Group sales fell by 2 per cent to Fl 13.75bn, reflecting poor economic
conditions in Europe.
On the Amsterdam stock market, which had been braced for a loss, Philips'
shares soared by nearly 8 per cent to close up Fl 2 at Fl 27.30.
The operating loss in consumer electronics was barely changed at Fl 55m
compared with Fl 59m. Price erosion for consumer electronic equipment
totalled 2 per cent in the quarter, but Philips also managed to get its
costs down, producing a roughly similar loss.
In 1992, when restructuring provisions pushed Philips into a net loss of Fl
900m, consumer electronics ran up total operating losses of Fl 553m.
Mr Dudley Eustace, Philips' finance director, said: 'The consumer
electronics business in Europe remains extremely difficult, particularly in
Latin countries,' where last autumn's currency devaluations meant that
higher costs in guilder terms could not be passed on to consumers.
The US, however, has continued to grow, with the number of colour
televisions sold up 13 per cent compared with early 1992.
Philips refused to comment on the book profit which it will make on the Fl
3bn sale of its 35 per cent stake in a Japanese-based semi-conductor joint
venture, Matsushita Electronics Corp, to its partner Matsushita.
Mr Eustace would say only that the deal, announced last week, would be
completed in the second quarter and that the proceeds would be used to
reduce debt.
Mr Eustace, who joined Philips from British Aerospace in mid-1992, said
renewed efforts at better asset and cash management had paid off, producing
a Fl 547m decrease in working capital. Philips ended the quarter with a net
cash surplus of Fl 772m against a deficit of Fl 576m the year before.
This, in turn, enabled Philips to bolster its debt-to-equity ratio to 59:41
from 61:39 at the end of 1992. Mr Eustace said his five-year goal is to
achieve a ratio of 40:60.

STORA, Europe's leading pulp and paper group, yesterday reported a SKr78m
(Dollars 10.5m) loss after financial items for the first quarter as it
warned that market conditions were unlikely to improve significantly before
1994.
The result compared with a SKr49m profit in the same 1992 period, but
represented a sharp improvement on the SKr926m deficit which the group
recorded in the final quarter of last year.
The group expected average prices in local currencies to be lower in 1993
than in 1992, with volume growth held to below 1 per cent by the economic
downturn in Europe.
It noted that prices for many of its main products appeared to have stopped
falling, and said cost-cutting measures and the weakening of the krona would
have a positive impact on its result.
Group sales rose to SKr12.95bn from SKr12.45bn. The group's biggest unit,
Stora Feldmuhle, returned a SKr47m operating profit, after a SKr65m loss in
the first quarter of 1992, as sales rose to SKr3.86bn from SKr3.28bn.

stake

<TEXT>
RHONE-POULENC, the French chemicals company, is considering a public sale of
its 35 per cent stake in Roussel-UCLAF, the pharmaceuticals group, on the
stock market.
The sale of the Roussel stake, which would be worth FFr1.02bn (Dollars 188m)
on yesterday's share price of FFr548, is one of a number of options being
considered by Rhone in conjunction with Hoechst, the German chemicals group
that controls Roussel with a 54.5 per cent holding.
Rhone yesterday confirmed a French newspaper report that it was discussing
the possibility of a share sale with Hoechst. However, it was also
considering other forms of divestment, which were believed to include the
transfer of assets and products.
Meanwhile, Roussel announced that it planned to extend the mandate of its
managing board chaired by Mr Edouard Sakiz until the end of the year to
stabilise the company during the discussions over the future of the Rhone
stake. Mr Sakiz, 67, had been due to retire at the end of next month.
Roussel is a specialised pharmaceuticals company best known for its
controversial abortion pill. It saw net profits rise by 72 per cent to
FFr1.03bn last year from FFr598m in 1991 on consolidated sales of FFr14.8bn.
The fate of the Rhone stake should be decided by the end of this year. Rhone
which is 43 per cent owned by the French government, was given the shares by
the state in 1990 as part of a general reshuffling of public sector chemical
and pharmaceutical interests.
Under the terms of the government's agreement signed in June 1987, the
Roussel stake was to be held for six years until June 1993 when its
ownership would be subject to renegotiation.
Rhone is subject to the same terms, but it has secured Hoechst's consent to
extend the current agreement until the end of the year.

reason for loss

<TEXT>
ASCOM, the Swiss tele-communications equipment group, blamed inadequate
internal controls for the belated discovery last month of SFr61m (Dollars
41m) in extraordinary losses at its German subsidiaries.
The discovery forced the group to announce last week that it would suffer a
1992 net loss of SFr46m and pass its dividend rather than achieve the
roughly SFr25m net profit forecast a few days earlier in a letter to
shareholders.
Mr Leonardo Vannotti, president, accepted the full blame for the debacle,
which has caused Ascom shares to lose about 14 per cent of their value.
However, he said at the group's annual press conference yesterday that no
member of group management would be resigning.
The losses arose in the group's cable television and mobile radio
subsidiaries in Germany. Its cable franchises, purchased only three years
ago, have required heavy investment in infrastructure, but so far have
attracted few subscribers. The mobile radio business was left with large
stocks of technologically out-dated products.
In both cases, internal reporting procedures were inadequate and it was only
after line managers were replaced in March that the need for large
write-offs was discovered by external auditors.
Mr Vannotti said group management had been working hard on improving
internal controls at Ascom but it was difficult to find the right people for
these positions.
The group, the product of a 1987 merger of three traditional protected
suppliers to the Swiss PTT, had not needed strong controls in the past.
Both Mr Vannotti and the board believed that the group's new strategy to
expand in specialised global niches was still the right one and they were
confident that the recent reporting failure would not recur. It was also
clear that group managers had not deliberately misled investors.
Therefore, there was no point in any of them resign-ing.
Mr Vannotti said he expected the group to return to profit this year.

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCANDINAVISKA Enskilda Banken, Sweden's leading commercial bank, said
yesterday sharply improved interest and other earnings had enabled it to cut
its operating loss in the first quarter by 55 per cent to SKr608m (Dollars
83m), compared with an SKr1.36bn loss in the same period last year.
The news triggered a renewed surge in SE Banken's share price, which ended
the day at three times its value of eight days ago. The bank brought forward
its results by a week in response to feverish market activity in recent days
based on speculation that it and other Swedish banks had passed the worst of
a credit loss crisis which saw them report large losses last year.
SE Banken's most-traded A shares soared to SKr28.50 from SKr15 before
closing on profit-taking at SKr23. On April 27, they stood at SKr7.60.
State-owned Nordbanken, reported it had returned to the black in the first
quarter, showing an operating profit of SKr304m compared with a loss of
SKr1.4bn in the same period last year. Its operating profit before credit
losses was up 66 per cent at SKr1.65bn compared with SKr994m.
The bank's credit losses showed a fall to SKr1.3bn from SKr2.4bn. This was
distorted by the removal of SKr50bn in problem loans previously held by
Nordbanken to Securum, a so-called 'bad bank' set up by the government to
take the worst of Nordbanken's credit risks off its hands.
Handelsbanken has reported a return to profit and Gotabank a reduction in
its losses.
SE Banken said its loan losses in the first quarter rose 4 per cent to
SKr2.9bn from SKr2.8bn last year. Negotiated interest deferments were up to
SKr380m from SKr209m, and non-paid interest on non-performing loans almost
trebled to SKr732m from SKr247m.

Profits at James Beattie, the West Midlands-based stores group, declined
from Pounds 7.73m to Pounds 6.83m pre-tax over the year ended January 31.
Sales, excluding VAT, improved 10 per cent to Pounds 74.6m.
Investment income and interest fell 24 per cent to Pounds 1.89m. Earnings
per share slipped to 9.8p (11.3p) but an increased final dividend of 4.6p
lifts the total from 5.75p to 6p.
The directors said the results were achieved in a retail climate 'dominated
by unremitting trading pressures throughout the year.' The company is due to
open its ninth store, at Aylesbury, in September.

FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Cheltenham to take over Heart of England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester Building Society yesterday disclosed that it will
take over the marginally profitable Heart of England Building Society
following the collapse in March of an attempt to do so by the Bank of
Edinburgh.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, C&amp;G chief executive, said the proposed merger was 'not
a rescue'. It had assessed Heart of England's mortgage book and assets
closely following a problematical merger with the Portsmouth Building
Society in 1991.
'We have said before that we're not in the rescue business, and this is not
a rescue,' he said. Heart of England was a 'middle England society with a
middle of the road mortgage book quite unlike the Portsmouth', he added.
C&amp;G's pre-tax profit for 1992 fell 29 per cent after making Pounds 211m
provisions against bad and doubtful debts, which included Pounds 90m against
loans inherited from the Portsmouth, a society with a poor mortgage book.
C&amp;G, the sixth largest society with assets of Pounds 16bn, indicated that it
may close 12 of Heart of England's 50 branches which overlap with its own.
Heart of England members will vote on the proposal on June 8.
The society said that because its reserve to assets ratio of 4.54 per cent
was higher than Heart of England's 4.22 per cent, it would not pay a bonus.
Heart of England members would earn extra interest, and get a discount on
new mortgages.
Heart of England, based in Warwick, had assets at February 28 of Pounds 1bn,
and pre-tax profits for the year were Pounds 1.6m.

FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: 20% expansion for Tate &amp; Lyle - Benefit of
sterling devaluation and fall in green pound offset one-off charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TATE &amp; LYLE, the sugar and sweeteners group, lifted half year pre-tax
profits by 20 per cent to Pounds 107.6m, and is increasing its interim
dividend by 7.5 per cent to 4.3p.
Mr Neil Shaw, executive chairman, said the group was confident of making
'good progress for the year as a whole'. In the last financial year it
suffered its first profit fall for 14 years.
He said the group was looking at more investment projects than ever before.
These included markets such as China, Russia and south-east Asia.
The current year should see profits from the Hungarian sugar and starch
operations, he said, although the potato starch plant in eastern Germany,
opened last autumn, was suffering from oversupply in the market. Progress on
sucralose, a low calorie sweetener, and Stellar, a low-calorie fat
substitute, had been slower than Tate had hoped, however.
The shares fell 8p to 397p.
Devaluation of sterling and the fall in the green pound aided profits for
the 26 weeks to March 27. Translation gains added Pounds 7.4m, and another
Pounds 4m came from better sugar margins because of higher prices caused by
the green pound fall, and a Pounds 3m stock profit also came from the green
pound's move.
However, Mr Paul Lewis, deputy chairman and group finance director, said
there were also one-off costs in the half year, such as Pounds 4m relating
to the five month strike at Domino Sugar's Brooklyn refinery in the US, and
another Pounds 4m to bring the overseas pension funds up to UK accounting
standards.
The figures also included an amount, believed to be approaching Pounds 1m,
of compensation to Mr Stephen Brown, the former chief executive whose
departure was announced in March. Mr Shaw said there was no intention to
replace Mr Brown from outside the company.
There were four contenders for the post within the group, running the four
main divisions, and one of these could become chief executive in the next
two to three years, Mr Shaw said.
Profits for the comparable half year were restated at Pounds 89.7m, down
Pounds 2.3m, because of a change in accounting for employees post-retirement
health benefits.
Turnover rose 13 per cent to Pounds 1.85bn, and operating profits were up 12
per cent to Pounds 127.2m.
Operating profits from sugar in North America fell 20 per cent to Pounds
17.3m, affected by the Domino strike and by weak prices and oversupply in
the market. That was more than offset in the UK, European and Australian
sugar operations where profits rose 30 per cent to Pounds 51m. UK profits
were boosted by the green pound and by improved productivity, while in
Australia there was a record tonnage produced.
The geographical mix was reversed in sweeteners and starches, with North
American profits up 24 per cent to Pounds 34.9m, on the recovery at Staley,
but European profits fell 18 per cent to Pounds 21.5m.
Profits from sugar by-products rose 47 per cent to Pounds 16.6m. Associates
profits were up from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 4.8m.
The net interest charge fell from Pounds 26.7m to Pounds 24.4m. Strong cash
flow reduced the bill but translation of overseas debt pushed gearing up
slightly to 92 per cent, which is a seasonal peak.
Fully diluted earnings per share were up from 12.9p to 15.9p.

<TEXT>
Losses at Serif, the USM-quoted specialist printer and packaging group, were
cut from Pounds 2.21m to Pounds 943,000 pre-tax for the year to the end of
December.
The period was one of rationalisation and reorganisation. Sales of
continuing activities amounted to Pounds 21.4m (Pounds 26.5m). Operating
costs were reduced to Pounds 21.8m (Pounds 38.5m) and exceptional provisions
were Pounds 649,000 (Pounds 1.04m).
Tax took Pounds 80,000 (Pounds 294,000) and after extraordinary charges of
Pounds 795,000 (Pounds 5m) the retained loss emerged at Pounds 1.82m (Pounds
7.52m).
Losses per share were lower at 4.1p, compared with 10.1p.
The company is proposing a capital reduction in order to resume ordinary
dividend payments.
Mr Alan Brooker is to retire as chairman. He will be succeeded by Mr John
Pryke, the chief executive.

FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: RPC flotation to raise Pounds 30m and give
Pounds 75m value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RPC GROUP, the rigid plastic packaging company, has issued the pathfinder
prospectus for its flotation later this month. The float is expected to
value the group at about Pounds 75m and raise over Pounds 30m.
Of the shares sold, 65 per cent will be placed with institutions and 35 per
cent will be available through a financial intermediaries offer.
The price of the shares will be announced on May 18.
The prospectus showed that operating profits for the year to March 31 rose
from Pounds 4.96m to Pounds 6.95m, on sales ahead 10.2 per cent at Pounds
63.7m.
It said that the new financial year had started well with 'encouraging'
order levels and production activity across all its product ranges.
Since the group completed a Pounds 33.4m management buy out two years ago
profits have risen 2 1/2 times.
CINVen, which backed the MBO, is to retain about 25 per cent of RPC's shares
after the float. Management and employees will have about 20 per cent.
Unusually, RPC will increase its debt through the flotation. It will use
more than the money raised to redeem preference shares and buy back shares
from existing investors including staff.
As a result the group will add about Pounds 4.3m of debt, with gearing
rising from virtually nil, prior to the float, to nearly 20 per cent
afterwards.
RPC's directors said they were confident that the company's strong cash
generation, which has allowed it to repay Pounds 12m of debt and invest
another Pounds 12m since its MBO, meant taking on debt would not be a
problem.
RPC has about 10 per cent of the rigid plastic packaging market in the UK,
making it the second largest participant.
No one customer accounts for more than 5 per cent of sales, and 44 per cent
of its turnover is in food containers. Packaging for surface coatings,
mainly paints, represents the largest single part of turnover at 21 per
cent.
Mr Ron Marsh, chief executive, said RPC had an excellent opportunity to
become the dominant manufacturer of rigid plastic packaging in the UK
market.
This type of packaging has been growing faster than others, for example, as
it was substituted for other materials such as metal and glass.
Paints used to be packed in cans, but now more than half the market for
emulsion paints was in plastic pots.
About 35 per cent of tomato ketchup was now sold in squeezy bottles instead
of glass.
RPC is keen to expand into packaging for toiletries and is also looking at
making European acquisitions.
The prospectus said that prices of polymers, the main raw material
accounting for 29 per cent of group costs, were beginning to rise after
falling significantly since 1991.
Mr Marsh said that 30 per cent of group turnover was on contracts where
prices were linked to polymer prices.
He said there had not been a significant benefit from falling prices over
recent years.
Baring Brothers is the merchant bank and Cazenove the broker to the issue.

FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: RTZ says no decisive rise likely this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, would have to wait at least until
1994 for a really decisive improvement in operating results, said Sir Derek
Birkin, chairman, at the annual meeting yesterday.
Nevertheless, in spite of a high level of capital investment, RTZ's cash
flow would remain strong and the balance sheet robust.
Sir Derek suggested that, although most metals prices would probably go no
lower, 'recovery to higher price levels will be a slow process.'
RTZ had not not been surprised by the recent steep fall in copper prices but
this was the most important metal for the group and every 10 cent per lb
movement in the price affected net earnings by Pounds 60m.
Economic recovery in North America, 'and I hope just commencing in the UK,'
would benefit RTZ's industrial operations and the probable changes in the US
dollar-sterling exchange rate this year would also have a beneficial impact
on earnings reported in sterling.
As usual the meeting was enlivened by questions and protests from action and
interest groups about RTZ activities worldwide - this time specifically
about mining in Richards Bay, South Africa, in Honduras and Nevada. There
were also questions about directors' bonuses and whether the auditors should
be changed to revent them and RTZ becoming, 'too chummy.'
Sir Denys Henderson, the non-executive director who heads RTZ's remuneration
committee, defended the decision to increase directors' bonuses last year by
48 per cent to Pounds 160,386 on the grounds that the company needed to
attract, motivate and retain the best talent available.
He pointed out that total directors' payments were up by 2 per cent last
year which was 'not unreasonable.'

FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: National Express makes purchase and
disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL EXPRESS, the coach service operator which was floated on the Stock
Exchange in December, is acquiring Scottish Citylink Coaches, the main
subsidiary of Saltire Holdings, for Pounds 5.11m in shares, loan notes and
cash.
At the same time the group announced that it has agreed to sell Express
Travel, its coach operating subsidiary, and Bruce's Coaches, a coach
operating subsidiary acquired with Scottish Citylink, for Pounds 1.2m in
cash to British Bus.
The sale of Express Travel represents a further step in reducing NEL's
involvement in the actual operation of coaches. Express Travel, which will
continue to provide coaches under contract to NEL, made profits of Pounds
537,000 and had net tangible assets of Pounds 942,000 at the end of
December.
Scottish Citylink organises and markets 16 long distance scheduled coach
services in Scotland, together with a number of commuter services including
the Glasgow/Edinburgh link, and 10 cross-border routes between Scotland and
London. It also offers services to Ireland and markets services between
Scotland and mainland Europe.
National said the acquisition would help it compete more effectively on
cross-border routes with British Rail, significantly broaden its customer
base and geographic spread and enhance profitability through the addition of
Scottish Citylink's higher margin services within Scotland.
Under the terms of the deal, Saltire's shareholders will receive 1.8m new
National Express shares with the balance of Pounds 1.8m to be satisfied in
loan notes, up to a maximum of Pounds 1.5m, and cash.
National's shares closed 1p up at 187p yesterday.

FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Olivetti UK back in black with Pounds 1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Good housekeeping and a tight rein on expenses helped Olivetti's UK
subsidiary return to profit last year despite deteriorating trading
conditions and falling prices.
The improvement seems to justify the decision taken at the beginning of 1992
to merge Olivetti Systems and Networks and Olivetti Office into a single
company.
Profit before tax was Pounds 1.04m, compared with a loss of Pounds 545,000.
Turnover was flat at Pounds 202.2m (Pounds 203.5m).
Operating expenses were cut from Pounds 40.1m to Pounds 32.6m and interest
payments were reduced from Pounds 5m to Pounds 1.6m. Mr Paolo Tosi, Olivetti
UK managing director, said the improvement had been the result of a review
which reduced operating expenses by 20 per cent. Tight control over working
capital and inventory helped to reduce interest costs.

FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Harmony announces Pounds 2m rights and
property move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW board at Harmony Leisure, the loss-making pubs and restaurant group,
yesterday announced a 'radical change in strategy' and a refinancing
involving a Pounds 1.8m rights issue and acquisition of two property
companies.
The acquisitions create a property investment and dealing division, which
Harmony intends to expand through further acquisitions.
Meanwhile, it will act to bring the leisure division back into profit.
Harmony is buying Hoe Properties from Mr Lewis Davis, a Harmony director,
for Pounds 439,000, and Kewbrook Investments from Mr John Main, the current
chairman, for Pounds 204,000. The deals involve the issue of 12.9m shares.
Yesterday Harmony said it was likely to incur significant pre-tax losses for
the full year to March 31. Last time Harmony lost Pounds 3.68m before tax.
The 3-for-2 rights issue at 5p is fully underwritten by Guiness Mahon.

FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: N Brown improves 22% to Pounds 19m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
N BROWN, the Manchester-based direct mail order group which specialises in
clothing for older women, yesterday reported a 21.5 per cent increase in
full year pre-tax profits.
For the 52 weeks to February 27 profits rose from Pounds 15.7m to Pounds
19m, on turnover ahead 12 per cent to Pounds 170.8m (Pounds 152.6m).
Earnings per share were 17.5 per cent higher at 17.74p (15.10p), and a final
dividend of 5.06p makes a total of 7p (6p).
Sir David Alliance, chairman, was pleased with the record results in a
difficult year for the retail sector as a whole. 'Concentration on one of
our long held beliefs, of improving service and value to customers, is
paying off with strong evidence of established customers ordering more
frequently,' he said.
The core home shopping business increased sales by 13 per cent to Pounds
164.2m (Pounds 145.6m) including turnover of Pounds 8.2m (Pounds 1.2m) from
Odhams, the mail order video, compact disc and children's learning packs
company, acquired from the receiver in November 1991.
Home shopping operating profits increased 13 per cent to Pounds 22.6m
(Pounds 20m). The previous figure was restated to include Pounds 939,000 of
exceptional costs related to a warehouse reorganisation
The operating margin was maintained at 13.8 (13.7) per cent despite only a
small contribution to profits from Odhams.
Pre-tax profits also benefited from a Pounds 522,000 exceptional profit on
the sale of a stake acquired in a potential acquisition target, where a rise
in the share price ultimately eliminated the opportunity.
In addition, interest charges fell by 18.5 per cent to Pounds 3.3m (Pounds
4.05m) mainly reflecting the lower cost of funds. Gearing at the end of
February stood at 37 per cent (44 per cent).
COMMENT
Brown has built a solid reputation for recession busting on the back of its
carefully targetted niche direct mail-order business focused primarily on
selling clothes to older women. It claims 24 per cent of the Pounds 726m UK
direct home shopping market which, unlike the larger agency business, has
been growing quickly over the past decade. Demographics are working in the
group's favour. However, it has also been actively reducing costs and
improving customer service, for example, by consolidating five warehouses
into a single unit and investing in computer technology - measures which are
only just beginning their pay back. Aside from the Odhams acquisition it is
also expanding its existing business. Of the turnover 15 per cent came from
the three new catalogues launched in the past three years. The share price
has risen in recent months, but with pre-tax profits of about Pounds 21m
this year puting the shares on 18 times prospective earnings, the stock
could still go higher.

FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Micro Focus shares jump on alliance
agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Micro Focus climbed sharply yesterday on news that the
Berkshire-based computer software company has agreed a newstrategic alliance
with Microsoft, the world's largest personal computer software house.
The shares rose 65p to close at Pounds 20.68, halting a slide which has seen
Micro Focus stock lose a third of its value over the past few months. The
shares had previously risen dramatically since the shares became available
to US investors through ADRs.
The slide was apparently caused by concern that Microsoft might seek some
variation in its licensing arrangements with Micro Focus, through which it
has access to the UK company's software technology.
Micro Focus is the world leader in software development tools, which enable
programmers to design and develop programs in Cobol, the world's most
popular business computer language, on personal computers.
Microsoft has in fact agreed to stop selling its own Cobol development
system, which incorporated Micro Focus technology, and will instead market
the Micro Focus product.
Micro Focus becomes a partner in Microsoft's Solution Providers program,
which will give the company direct access to Microsoft information,
training, tools and products, as well as the opportunity to resell the
Microsoft product line.

FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: ERF launches vehicle for recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ERF, the last independent publicly-quoted UK heavy truck maker, launches
today its new EC range of heavy trucks following a four-year, Pounds 14m
investment programme.
The EC truck range will play a crucial role in the company's effort to
recover from recession and end three successive years of losses. In parallel
with the new product development programme ERF has:
carried out a reorganisation of its assembly operations in Sandbach and
Middlewich, Cheshire;
reached agreement with its hourly-paid employees to allow team-working and
flexibility in working practices with the removal of demarcation lines;
entered the continental European market with the establishment of 13
distributors in France and five in Spain.
The EC range, which will replace ERF's existing E-series heavy-duty trucks,
has been developed during the harshest recession endured by the UK truck
industry in the post-war period.
ERF has suffered losses for the last three years, as the UK heavy truck
market (above 16 tonnes gross vehicle weight) has more than halved with
overall UK heavy truck registrations plunging to only 16,427 last year from
38,935 in 1989.
ERF's production in 1992 fell to 1,904 from 2,102 in 1991 and 4,319 in 1989.
Its UK registrations improved modestly by 2.6 per cent last year to 1,636
giving it an unchanged 10 per cent share of the UK heavy truck market.
Mr Peter Foden, chairman, said yesterday that new orders had started to
recover during the early months of 1993, and the company had returned to
full time working.
Output had been raised to 10 trucks a day, five days a week. During the
depth of the recession output fell as low as six trucks a day with only a
three-day week compared with a peak output of 21 a day in the first half of
1989 before the onset of recession.
Mr Foden said that capacity at the Sandbach assembly plant had been
increased from 21 a day to 30 a day on a single shift as part of the
preparation for the launch of the EC truck range. Cab assembly and painting
has been transferred to the nearby Middlewich plant.
ERF is aiming to increase productivity by about 20 per cent as a result of
its new labour agreement, which has:
replaced the separate trades of body-builder, fitter, electrician, welder
and sprayer with a single category of 'assembler';
established team working with each member in the 12-15 strong teams trained
to carry out all of the jobs covered by the team;
abolished clocking in for a six-month trial period.
ERF has agreed a 4 per cent increase in basic pay rates from July 1 (or the
rate of inflation if higher) following a pay freeze since July 1992.
The company suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.7m, including exceptional
costs of Pounds 945,000, in the six months to the end of September 1992. The
second half results have been burdened by similar exceptional charges of
some Pounds 1m arising from the new EC truck range launch costs and the
costs of setting up the distributor networks in France and Spain.

FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: IAWS shows 35% advance to IPounds 1.19m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A 35 per cent increase in pre-tax profits was achieved from lower turnover
by IAWS Group in the half year to January 31.
This Irish-based food and agricultural company produced IPounds 1.19m
(Pounds 1.17m) compared with IPounds 880,000. Turnover came to IPounds
176.2m (IPounds 182.8m) reflecting slightly lower unit prices which resulted
from the strength of the punt.
Directors said the results were good against the background of currency
difficulties and high interest rates.
The food companies performed particularly well following the buy-out of the
minority in Shamrock Foods.
Purchase of the Hull fish meal and fish oil business enabled the group to
expand that activity into the UK for the first time.
Earnings were 0.93p (0.7p) and the interim dividend is again 1p.

FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: A Fisher sells herbs and spices to Burns
Philp for Pounds 25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group, has agreed to
sell for Pounds 25m the herbs and spice businesses acquired as part of its
recent acquisition of Hunter Saphir.
Burns Philp, an Australian group which is already the second largest
supplier of herbs and spices in North America, will pay cash for the
businesses, which comprise two plants in the Netherlands and a recently
rebuilt factory in Northampton.
Albert Fisher paid Pounds 29.3m for Hunter Saphir in January, and assumed
debt amounting to Pounds 9.8m. The group has therefore ended up buying the
fresh produce part of Hunter Saphir, which is what it wanted to keep, for
Pounds 14m.
Mr Stephen Walls, who in July takes over as chairman of Albert Fisher from
Mr Tony Millar, said he was pleased with the outcome. The merger of the two
fresh produce operations had started well.
Mr Andrew Turnbull, Burns Philp's managing director, said: 'The acquisition
gives us a strong base to enter the European industrial food service and
consumer spice markets, using the knowhow and experience we have developed
in North America.'

FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Trafalgar Pounds 98m in loss following
write-downs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR HOUSE reported a loss of Pounds 97.6m before tax in the half year
to March 31 after Pounds 120m of provisions, largely relating to a
write-down in the value of its property portfolio. Last time there was a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 54m.
Mr Allan Gormly, chief executive, said: 'It is not a question of kitchen
sinking it; the provisions are realistic given the group's Pounds 1bn
investment in property.' While he said there would be no need for future
provisions, he could not guarantee that there would be no further property
write-downs.
Ordinary shares in the construction, engineering and property group rose 3p
to 95p with the A shares up 2 1/2 p to 94p.
The group confirmed that Hongkong Land, which has a 25.1 per cent stake,
will provide the new chairman and finance director. The two posts will be
filled by Mr Simon Keswick, who will continue to be chairman of Hongkong
Land, and Mr David Gawler, finance director of Hongkong Land.
Touche Ross, which was replaced by KPMG Peat Marwick as auditor, sent a
letter to Trafalgar's shareholders rejecting criticism from investors over
the 1991 accounts.
These had to be restated after the Financial Reporting Review Panel said
that property write-downs should be taken through the profit and loss
account and not through reserves.
Mr Gormly said the group would pursue its disposal programme in an orderly
manner. 'I am not going to rush it.'
There have been two serious indications of offers for the hotels, which
include the Ritz and the Stafford, but Trafalgar did not find them
satisfactory.
The big property development projects have been put on the 'backburner',
while property for letting will be slowly sold off.
Since September 1992 the workforce has been reduced by 2,600 people and
another 500 jobs are to go by the end of this year.
Trafalgar made Pounds 22.4m before tax and exceptional provisions, on sales
of Pounds 1.14bn (Pounds 1.21bn). The core businesses, engineering and
construction, reported profits of Pounds 34.7m (Pounds 44.2m) and Pounds
7.8m (Pounds 9.1m) respectively. Construction projects were also responsible
for the Pounds 2.8m of profits from associates.
Property incurred a loss of Pounds 300,000 (Pounds 6.6m profit), while
profits from shipping and hotels fell to Pounds 200,000 (Pounds 8m).
The group is hoping that its two worst performing divisions will benefit
from the economic upturn.
Net borrowings were Pounds 329m compared with Pounds 353m at September 30.
After allowing for the rights issue proceeds of Pounds 205m, this represents
an increase of Pounds 181m, some Pounds 68m of which was due to the
weakening of sterling against the dollar.
Losses per share were 18p (earnings of 6p). The interim dividend is cut to
1.25p (4.4p).

FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: US effect puts LIT Pounds 1m in red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LIT Holdings, the marketing services, investment and fund management group,
swung from profits of Pounds 1.29m to losses of Pounds 1.21m pre-tax for the
year to end-December.
Operating profits of Johnson Fry, the UK financial services activity, rose
from Pounds 2.4m to a record Pounds 2.81m.
However, LIT America, the provider of market services to the US futures and
options markets, ran up a loss of Pounds 50,000. This compared with profits
of Pounds 2.39m previously.
A provision of Pounds 1.8m against doubtful receivables at LIT America was
taken above the line.
Last month it was announced that agreement in principle had been reached for
the sale of LIT America to Spear Leeds &amp; Kellogg, a New York-based
securities firm.
Consideration will be in cash and loan notes.
Proceeds of the cash element will be used to reduce indebtedness, which at
the year-end stood at Pounds 11.3m.
Group turnover for 1992 totalled Pounds 76.9m (Pounds 81.5m). Central
charges were cut from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 2.1m.
Losses per share emerged at 6.8p (1.4p).
The directors said the preliminary results had been prepared without regard
to the possible financial effects of the proposed sale of LIT America or the
proposed capital reconstruction.

FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Flotations ahead in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE first quarter of this year the number of companies floating on the
Stock Exchange rose from 12 to 16.
KPMG Corporate Finance estimated that 1993 as a whole should see more than
90 new issues.
That would be a return to the 1991 level after a total of 70 last year.
Mr Neil Austin, head of new issues at KPMG, said there were a great deal
more companies currently interested in flotation than at the same time last
year.
For some companies flotation was, however, an inappropriate method of
funding growth as recovery takes root.
'There is a gap between development capital, which has an important part to
play, and a full flot-ation.'
'It must be hoped that the continuing discussions on a second market can
produce a viable middle option, ' he said.

FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Olivetti UK back in the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOOD HOUSEKEEPING and a tight rein on expenses helped Olivetti's UK
subsidiary return to profit last year despite deteriorating trading
conditions and falling prices.
The improvement seems to justify the decision taken at the beginning of 1992
to merge Olivetti Systems and Networks and Olivetti Office into a single
company.
Profit before tax was Pounds 1.04m, compared with a loss of Pounds 545,000.
Turnover was flat at Pounds 202.2m (Pounds 203.5m).
Operating expenses were cut from Pounds 40.1m to Pounds 32.6m and interest
payments were reduced from Pounds 5m to Pounds 1.6m. Mr Paolo Tosi, Olivetti
UK managing director, said the improvement had been the result of a review
which reduced operating expenses by 20 per cent. Tight control over working
capital and inventory helped to reduce interest costs.
Mr Tosi said that the price of hardware had fallen during 1992 by an average
40 per cent, putting heavy pressure on profit margins.
Olivetti's new range of low cost personal computers was doing well, Mr Tosi
said, with revenues up more than 20 per cent in the first quarter of 1993
compared with the same period in 1992.
By comparison, Olivetti as a whole lost L649.9bn (Pounds 276.3m) on revenues
of L8,025bn.

FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Former Burton chief joins Ratners board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR LAURENCE Cooklin, who was sacked at Burton Group after 14 months as chief
executive of the UK fashion company, has been appointed to the board of
Ratners, the jewellery chain.
Mr Cooklin will become chief executive UK Jewellery and will report to Mr
James McAdam, chairman and group chief executive.
Mr McAdam said yesterday that Mr Cooklin had a considerable reputation as a
hands-on manager. 'We have not taken him on as chief executive,' he said.
'It is very much a hands-on job. (At Burton) he was managing director of
buying and the merchandising side.'
He will be responsible for operational management at Ratners, H Samuel and
Ernest Jones, the group's three jewellery chains.
Mr Cooklin stepped into the chief executive slot at Burton when Sir Ralph
Halpern, chairman and chief executive, was forced out by shareholder
pressure following the collapse in profits in 1990.
While at Burton, Mr Cooklin enjoyed a generous remuneration package, if not
equal to that of his boss, the first earner of a Pounds 1m salary in the UK,
then certainly in line with the extravagance with which the Halpern era
became associated.
Mr McAdam stressed yesterday that Mr Cooklin had been given a 'perfectly
standard' two-year contract and would be receiving a salary in line with
other board members.

FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Royal Bank advances 91% to Pounds 92m
despite bad debt provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RETURN to profit in its core branch banking business and trebled profits
in its Direct Line telephone insurance operation helped Royal Bank of
Scotland raise interim pre-tax profits by 91 per cent, from Pounds 48m to
Pounds 91.6m.
The bank, which increased loans to customers in the six months to March 31
helped by a Pounds 650m rise in personal mortgages, said it was confident
that full-year provisions for bad and doubtful debts would be below last
year.
Lord Younger, chairman, said he was confident of further progress in the
second half, helped by renewed economic growth.
'The upturn in performance at the full year is not only being sustained, but
is gathering momentum,' he said.
Although profit before provisions rose 32 per cent to Pounds 285m (Pounds
216m), the rise at the pre-tax level was contained by bad debt provisions.
These stood at Pounds 183m (Pounds 163m), but were substantially lower than
the figure of Pounds 238m for last year's second half.
These latest accounts were prepared under the FRS 3 accounting standard, and
the comparatives have been restated accordingly.
The interim dividend is been raised to 3p (2.8p) on earnings per share of 5p
(2.9p).
The core ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets rose to 7 per cent
(6.6 per cent) after the bank retained Pounds 15.7m (Pounds 1m).
Branch banking returned to profit with Pounds 6m (Pounds 8.4m profit), after
a poor second half pushed it into a Pounds 16.1m loss in 1991-92. The
Columbus restructuring project was estimated to have raised profits by
Pounds 5m.
The corporate and institutional banking division raised profits by 39 per
cent to Pounds 57.1m. 'Very considerable progress' had been made in selling
treasury and capital markets services to existing corporate customers.
Citizens Financial Group, the US retail banking subsidiary which is to boost
its assets by nearly 50 per cent by acquiring Boston Five Bancorp, lifted
profits by Pounds 12m to Pounds 20.9m.
Mr George Mathewson, chief executive, said Royal Bank had been approached by
a large US bank which hoped to link with its Ibos service offering
cross-border banking services to companies in Britain, Spain, Portugal and
France.
The proposed disposal of 90.1 per cent of Charterhouse, Royal Bank's
merchant bank, is expected to lead to a book loss of Pounds 35m. The net
reduction to reserves will be Pounds 12m, after writing back Pounds 23m of
goodwill on disposal.
Net interest income rose to Pounds 421m (Pounds 384m) as the spread between
the interest earned on assets and paid on liabilities rose to 2.2 percentage
points (1.9 percentage points) and interest bearing assets rose 12 per cent.
Other operating income rose to Pounds 313m (Pounds 240m) and now constitutes
42 per cent of total income (38 per cent). Expenses rose by 10 per cent, but
the cost to income ratio fell to 61.4 per cent (65.6 per cent).
The shares closed unchanged at 267p.

FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Geest shares dive on banana price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Geest yesterday fell almost a third and analysts said interim
profits could drop as low as break-even after the company said a banana
price war had slashed prices in northern Europe.
In the first half of 1992 the fresh produce and prepared foods company
reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 15.4m.
The shares fell 106p to 328p but later rallied to 366p.
However, Mr Leonard van Geest, chairman, told the annual meeting yesterday
that the board intended to at least maintain the interim dividend at 3.7p.
He said the combination of the drop in prices and 'start-up difficulties' at
its new banana plantation in Costa Rica would affect first half profits.
Mr van Geest declined to quantify the impact but one analyst said: 'We were
expecting profits to be between Pounds 15m and Pounds 16m, but now we are
expecting between nought and Pounds 2m.'
The chairman told shareholders that 'while the first quarter of the year
began satisfactorily, during April it became apparent that the supply of
dollar bananas into the European Community, ahead of the new import regime
scheduled for July 1, exceeded demand.'
Geest had cut its own prices by 39 per cent owing to the unexpected and
rapid fall in banana prices throughout the EC. Prices were significantly
below those achieved in the equivalent periods over the previous two years,
he said.
Analysts confirmed the roots of the decline in prices lay in the EC's new
import regime, from which Geest is set to gain market share. Some banana
traders, who are likely to lose market share, had reduced their orders from
farmers.
Some banana growers, mainly from Ecuador, had responded by shipping excess
fruit to the European continent at discounted prices.
Geest's sensitivity to price fluctuations had been heightened because it is
now both a banana grower and trader. The company's new Costa Rican
plantation began exporting in January .
The UK market had been relatively stable until France last week announced
that it would be limiting imports from certain Afro-Carribean-Pacific
states, including the Ivory Coast and Cameroon.
Mr van Geest said: 'This fruit has already started to come on to the UK
market and is having an adverse affect on prices.'

FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Berisford presses bid on Clark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERISFORD INTERNATIONAL yesterday pressed its Pounds 184m bid on
shareholders of C&amp;J Clark warning of 'potentially disastrous consequences'
for the company if the offer is turned down.
It said that if its offer failed, Clark, which is a private company, would
sink back into the 'dissension and acrimony which have damaged their
(shareholders') interest for years'.
The proposal of selling the business to Berisford will be voted on at a
special meeting of Clark's shareholders tomorrow. Members of the Clark
family hold 70 per cent of the shares.
Clark's board has said that the offer from the property and agribusiness
company, of 213p a share in cash or securities plus approximately 26p of
deferred cash, is 'fair and reasonable'. Seven of the 11 directors have
urged shareholders to accept, but a group of dissident shareholders,
supported by three directors who did not recommend the bid, has argued
against it.
This group, which has adopted the acronym Shoes, has put forward a plan for
a shareholder council and a flotation of the company within five years.
Mr Brian Smith, a non-executive director of Berisford, told shareholders and
employees of Clark at a meeting last week that 'the Shoes proposals for a
shareholder council with board representation is likely to mean that the
present internal anarchy will be translated into a more formalised open
warfare'. Berisford is offering two seats on its board to Clark directors if
the offer succeeds.
Mr Alan Bowkett, chief executive of Berisford, said yesterday, 'Clark's
cannot float in five years or even ten years unless and until the family
disagreements which have split the company for the last decade can be
solved, and the Shoes campaign starkly demonstrates that this is unlikely'.
Clark has been plagued by arguments between shareholders, which culminated
in an acrimonious extraordinary meeting last October when shareholders
agreed to look for a bidder. Schroders, Clark's merchant bank, contacted
over 40 companies seeking offers and a committee of the board chose
Berisford's as the best.

down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ERIC Kohn, the investor who led the dissident shareholder group which
seized control of Holmes Protection Group 18 months ago, has resigned as
chief executive and vice chairman of the US-based, but London-listed
security concern.
Mr Kohn will remain on the board. He felt the restructuring of the group had
been 'substantially completed,' and said he was resigning for personal
reasons to devote time to his other business interests, which include being
chairman of Barons Financial Services (UK).
He had always intended to step down once the company had achieved a
turnround and was 'moving forward' again. He emphasised that there was
'nothing sinister' in his decision.
Earlier this year, Holmes announced that, following the successful
completion of a debt restructuring programme, pre-tax profits for 1992
totalled Dollars 4.17m (Pounds 2.7m), compared with losses of Dollars 35.5m,
on turnover down from Dollars 59m to Dollars 56.2m.
The board, headed by Sir Ian MacGregor, once chairman of British Steel and
British Coal, has appointed Mr Richard Hickson, formerly chief operating
officer, as chief executive and president.
Separately, Holmes announced that it had terminated the lease on its offices
at Lake Success, New York.
The company had previously provided Dollars 1.65m for the lease, and will
record a gain of Dollars 920,000 after agreeing a termination payment of
Dollars 730,000.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir Flees to Cyprus: Labour calls for review of the
case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR leaders yesterday seized on Mr Asil Nadir's flight from Britain as
another example of the need for more effective procedures for countering
fraud.
Ministers ignored demands for an immediate Commons statement as criticism
was led by Mr Alistair Darling, opposition spokesman on Treasury affairs.
He said Mr Nadir's departure from the jurisdiction of UK courts was a matter
of 'great importance - damaging the ability of this country to prosecute
serious City fraud'.
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, told Mr Darling: 'You are referring to
the man in question as if he had already been found guilty. That you must
not do.'
She said no minister had submitted a request to make a statement on the
matter.
Mr Richard Caborn, the Labour MP who is chairman of the Commons trade and
industry select committee, said later yesterday that the fact that bail for
Mr Nadir was set at Pounds 3.5m should have ensured that he was subject to
the most stringent surveillance.
'Clearly there needs to be a review of the arrangements made in this case,'
he said.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir Flees to Cyprus: SFO stuck with no trial and only
token gestures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE TRIAL of Mr Asil Nadir
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
one of the most high-profile prosecutions brought by the Serious Fraud
Office - was due to start on September 13. He faced 13 charges alleging he
stole Pounds 34m from Polly Peck. There is now no chance that the trial will
take place.
With Mr Nadir beyond reach in northern Cyprus, the SFO can do little except
make token gestures. In a short statement yesterday, it said it was
considering further action, including issuing a fresh warrant for his
arrest. Police were also investigating how he was able to slip out of the
country in a private jet. Both courses of action, however, remain academic.
Unless Mr Nadir returns voluntarily, the papers for his prosecution will
gather dust.
The SFO is left to decide whether to go ahead with the prosecution of Mr
Nadir's co-defendant, Mr John Turner, Polly Peck's chief accountant. He
faces two charges of false accounting which he denies. He could stand trial
on his own. Yesterday, the SFO said only that it was too early to consider
its position on Mr Turner's case.
Mr Nadir was first arrested at Heathrow Airport in December 1990 on his
return from a trip to Turkey. He was initially charged with 18 counts of
theft and false accounting involving Pounds 25m. As the investigation
proceeded, the charges mounted until he faced 66 charges involving almost
Pounds 120m.
However, in June 1992, Mr Justice Tucker, the trial judge, ordered the
dismissal of 46 of the charges, These referred to money transfers from Polly
Peck to Unipac, a subsidiary.
The charges were later trimmed again to the current 13 which formed the
final indictment on which he would be tried. Mr Nadir always protested his
innocence and maintained that proof of this could be found in northern
Cyprus. The fact the SFO had never considered it necessary to visit there
angered him deeply.
As the case continued, Mr Nadir's health broke. He suffered from a severe
depression which left him unable to instruct his solicitor for several weeks
and having to seek psychiatric help.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir Flees to Cyprus: The island where inquiries reach
a dead end - All roads in the Polly Peck scandal lead to Cyprus. Asil Nadir
brought much investment to the eastern Mediterranean island but millions
from his international empire also drained away there
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTERED remains of Mr Asil Nadir's once high-flying business empire lie
in a dusty corner of the Mediterranean, tucked close to the Turkish
mainland.
An unseemly squabble has been under way in northern Cyprus for more than two
years over the last scraps of the carcass of Polly Peck International, a
group whose activities at its height ranged from fresh fruit to hotels and
electronics.
So far the wrangle has produced no cash, just frustration for the army of
lawyers and accountants trying to recover the Pounds 1bn that Polly Peck
owed to its creditors.
For serious students of Polly Peck, all roads have always led to northern
Cyprus, Nadir's birthplace. The self-proclaimed Turkish Cypriot republic
remained his home throughout the period that he built Polly Peck from an
East End clothing company to a disparate group with operations around the
world.
Thanks to the investment he brought to the island - much of it financed by
Polly Peck's creditors - Mr Nadir has enjoyed the status of a local hero.
Northern Cyprus was also the drain down which Polly Peck's wealth eventually
disappeared. Some Pounds 500m of the group's cash was sucked into the
republic. Investigators trying to find out where it went next have found the
trail difficult to follow.
Much of that money is alleged to have been routed back from Cyprus into
banks in London, to buy shares in Polly Peck as part of an illegal operation
to support the company's share price in the late 1980s.
Mr Nadir personally borrowed millions of pounds more from banks to finance
further share purchases in a move which was to push him deep into debt and
eventually, when Polly Peck collapsed, into bankruptcy.
Much of the money routed to Cyprus has not been traced at all. More than
Pounds 200m was supposedly used to buy development land in the republic.
However, Mr Michael Jordan of Cork Gully, in charge of the Polly Peck
administration, said yesterday no leases on the land were ever granted, and
the property remains in the possession of the government of the republic.
Where the cash went is not known.
The breakaway republic has presented countless other problems for Polly
Peck's bankers and other creditors. Lawyers have fought to establish their
claims over Polly Peck assets on the island, a process which has been
hampered by the fact that the republic is not recognised by the UK (or any
other country except Turkey).
Attempts to sue the Central Bank of Turkish Cyprus, and against Mr Mentes
Aziz, the lawyer against whom charges were brought and later dropped by the
Serious Fraud Office, have all come to nothing.
A settlement was agreed last week with the central bank, and a settlement to
the claim against Mr Aziz has also been negotiated, Mr Jordan said
yesterday.
He added said that he had received assurances from Mr Aziz yesterday that Mr
Nadir's departure for northern Cyprus would not interfere with the sale of
Polly Peck's businesses on the island, which include hotels and fruit
processing and packaging plants. The pressure being put on the Turkish
Cypriot government for Mr Nadir to return for trial, though, suggests that
relations could take another turn for the worse.
It is all a long way from the late 1980s, when Mr Nadir's Polly Peck had
appeared to secure itself a special position among the many wonder-stocks
produced during that decade.
The company's share price had jumped more than a thousand-fold in ten years
as it climbed into the list of the top 100 UK-based groups, making it the
best-performing stock of the decade. Its operations included the Del Monte
fresh fruit business, since sold by the administrators, and Sansui, the
Japanese electronics company.
The trappings of wealth assembled by Mr Nadir during the rise of Polly Peck
 -the racehorse, the paintings, the country estate - were all to be stripped
away later by bankruptcy.
Mr Neil Cooper, a partner with accountants Robson Rhodes, who is trustee in
bankruptcy to Mr Nadir, said: 'I am still hopeful that Mr Nadir might find
he is able to put together an offer to his creditors that might be
acceptable. Otherwise he will be an undischarged bankrupt all his life. I
believe he would prefer to return to London where he has chosen to live.'
However, Mr David Pollock of accountants Touche Ross, who is working on the
recovery of assets for the administration, said that if the Serious Fraud
Office decided to drop criminal action against Mr Nadir, that could speed up
civil action under which the administrators are trying to recover Pounds
370m from Mr Nadir. 'We will continue our investigations. I assume it won't
get any easier,' he said.

'NO WORDS can express the happiness I feel coming back to my people,' Mr
Asil Nadir cheerfully told Turkish journalists yesterday as he emerged from
his hideaway in northern Cyprus. But although his flight has now put him
outside the reach of British law, it is a homecoming that could turn
bittersweet.
His first day on his native island for two years was spent in the bosom of
his family. His mother, Mrs Safiye Nadir, and sister, Mrs Bilge Nevzat,
arrived early in the afternoon at Mr Nadir's luxuriously furnished home in
the mountains beyond the coastal resort of Kyrenia.
Well-wishers arrived in a constant stream. They were vetted by a chauffeur
before being led inside through the heavy wooden front doors.
Journalists from two Turkish mainland dailies and Turkey's broadcasting
corporation were ushered into the house for a brief meeting but afterwards
said only that they had promised Mr Nadir their conversation was 'off the
record'. Later, Mrs Nevzat peered, broadly smiling, around the half-open
door and said her brother would be willing to speak to the press only 'in a
few day's time'. Mr Nadir's return was the talk of north Cyprus and the
focus of enormous interest among his neighbours.
One shop-owner said one of Mr Nadir's workers had been airing the empty
house for a few days and had called that morning to fetch shopping. 'It
looks as if they were going to have a celebration', he commented. Cans of
soft drinks, red and white wine, vodka and whisky were among the goodies
stowed in the boot of a black Mercedes parked outside the house.
Villagers said they were shocked, surprised and happy to see Mr Nadir. 'Asil
is a fox . . . he has used his brain', said one elderly man.
Unlike some other fugitives from criminal charges in Britain, Mr Nadir
enjoys the advantage is that he is now on home soil - reportedly with three
houses on the island and the apparent tacit support of the local government.
If he intends to stay there permanently, as his Turkish Cypriot neighbours
believed yesterday, Mr Nadir's life seems likely to be luxurious, albeit
somewhat downbeat. It will be nevertheless something of a comedown from the
opulence he had been used to in London. Mr Nadir's home was in Belgravia,
owned by the Grosvenor Estate, which had been seeking to evict him for some
months.
Mr Neil Cooper, his trustee in bankruptcy, said yesterday: 'Mr Nadir lived
in a certain opulent lifestyle as befits the chairman of a major public
company.'
Even after his bankruptcy, Mr Cooper said Mr Nadir had often been able to
find money, explaining that his expenses were being paid by 'various friends
and associates prepared to support him'.
Mr Cooper's efforts to trace personal assets - with which Mr Nadir did not
always fully co-operate - give some insight into this lifestyle. He has
tracked down one of three expensive oil paintings owned by Mr Nadir, called
Sybil and estimated to be worth Pounds 250,000.
Two others - Sisters, also worth Pounds 250,000, and La Nuit a Bruges, worth
about Pounds 400,000 - are still unaccounted for. 'We speculate that they
may have gone abroad,' he said.
Mr Cooper said there were also numerous antiques, valuable artefacts,
properties and investments overseas held by Mr Nadir which he had been
unable to recover.
He said there were about 20 trusts and companies in offshore centres
including the Isle of Man and Liechtenstein in which Mr Nadir had interests.
'He more or less ignored the bankruptcy,' Mr Cooper said. Letters sometimes
went unanswered and information which had been requested was not provided.
'His memory was obviously not what it used to be.'
So far Mr Cooper has managed to realise less than Pounds 100,000 in assets.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir Flees to Cyprus: Slap in the face for bail rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM THE moment of Mr Asil Nadir's arrest, the Serious Fraud Office always
feared he would flee the UK to escape the prospect of a criminal trial and
possible imprisonment.
These concerns prompted the SFO to oppose bail being given to him - a highly
unusual move in important cases of alleged fraud.
The request for Mr Nadir to be held in custody while awaiting trial was
turned down by the courts. But despite some of the most severe bail
conditions ever imposed by a magistrates' court, the SFO's concerns have now
proved to be well-founded.
Mr Nadir's flight to northern Cyprus has exposed two large holes in the
ability of the criminal justice system to bring fraud suspects to justice -
the ease with which bail can be jumped and the problems of extradition back
to the UK.
With SFO cases usually taking two years between arrests being made and
trials starting, courts have refused to countenance someone being imprisoned
that long before trial.
Instead, Bow Street magistrates' court set severe bail conditions. Sureties
and securities totalling a record Pounds 3.5m were demanded, Mr Nadir's UK
and Turkish passports were confiscated and he was ordered to report to the
police weekly.
The sureties were provided by Mrs Ayesha Nadir, Mr Nadir's ex-wife, who put
up Pounds 500,000, and Mr Ramadan Guney, a Turkish businessman and distant
relation of the Polly Peck chairman, who provided Pounds 1m. Mr Nadir
himself had to provide a security - money lodged 'up front' with the courts
 -of Pounds 2m.
Mrs Nadir and Mr Guney are now both due to pay their sureties or risk jail
sentences themselves. Mr Nadir has clearly written off his Pounds 2m as the
price of escaping the British courts.
With no extradition treaty between the UK and northern Cyprus, whose
government is recognised only by Turkey, Mr Nadir is now at no risk of
prosecution. He can also travel extensively in the developing world where
many countries - notably Moslem nations - do not have extradition treaties
with the UK.
Mr Nadir is not the only fraud suspect to use the gaps in extradition
arrangements to avoid prosecution. The investigation into the collapsed Bank
of Credit and Commerce International was hindered from the outset by the
fact that the two most prominent protagonists, Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, the
bank's founder, and Mr Swaleh Naqvi, his right-hand man, were living, safe
from prosecution, in countries where no extradition treaties exist with the
UK or the US.
Mr Nadir's flight has left lawyers and police wondering how a similar
situation can be avoided in future. All agree, however, that there are no
simple and ready answers.
Mr Nadir has demonstrated that the most severe of bail conditions can be no
disincentive. The only alternative is to hold defendants in prison for up to
two years. Until now, this has been regarded as unthinkable. But many
lawyers have observed that the Maxwell affair has led to the courts making
decisions that increasingly support the SFO. After Mr Nadir, the possibility
that fraud suspects may spend considerable time behind bars before trial may
not be so remote - if the SFO can bring cases to court more quickly.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir Flees to Cyprus: Private jet made to order for a
quick getaway to freedom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS not the luxury to which Mr Asil Nadir was accustomed.
The flight from the UK to sanctuary in northern Cyprus was aboard a small
private jet. Its short range forced at least one stop en route. There was
not even a hostess on board to serve the drinks and snacks from the
mini-bar.
Mr Nadir had spent the previous evening at his home in one of London's best
addresses, Eaton Square, Belgravia, after his weekly visit to West End
Central police station in Savile Row. The one-mile trip was one of the
conditions of his bail.
But by lunchtime on Tuesday, he was almost certainly at one of London's many
smaller airports, boarding a white executive jet with few markings.
Within an hour he was outside UK airspace, by early evening in Turkey and at
10.30pm local time, at Ercan airport in northern Cyprus.
His escape plans need not have been laid far in advance.
The secretive world of private jet charter and ownership thrives on the
desire by business executives and politicians to travel at short notice and
conceal their movements.
Nor is there a legal obligation for anyone leaving the country to produce a
passport. The requirement is only to have the right papers when entering the
country.
The British pilot's flight plan would not necessarily have been a guide to
where an aircraft is going: flight plans can be, and are, changed during
flights, most usually to avoid bad weather.
'There is nothing stopping anyone hiring an aircraft and flying anywhere,'
said the Civil Aviation Authority.
Once away from the main flight paths, an aircraft can travel unnoticed by
air traffic controllers. By choosing the right route, it is possible to fly
all the way from London to Cyprus without entering controlled airspace.
There were reports yesterday that Mr Nadir's aircraft had followed a more
direct route via France and Turkey.
A quick first stop would have helped cover the escape trail: the aircraft's
charterer need only have bought a small amount of fuel in the UK to avoid
arousing suspicions that a long journey was planned.
Nor was it clear last night from which airport he had left.
There were conflicting reports that Mr Nadir travelled from Scotland, that
he flew from the London area and finally that his aircraft had taken off
from British Aerospace's private airport at Hatfield.
BAe said yesterday that it believed the passengers on the six private jets
that left during the day were regular travellers, well-known to the company.
Only one aircraft was going to France, a Cessna Citation, and all three
passengers on board were known to BAe.
Hatfield has no permanent customs and immigration post. BAe checks that
passenger lists and passports match.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir Flees to Cyprus: Local hero in a pariah state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WARM welcome accorded Mr Asil Nadir on arrival in his native Cyprus
should cause no surprise.
He was, until his arrest two years ago, the most successful Turkish Cypriot
outside the island and the main private backer of the ruling party in the
Turkish-controlled north.
This fact might be thought embarrassing now that he is a fugitive, but most
Turks, and especially most Turkish Cypriots, are more than willing to give
him the benefit of the doubt, assuming him to be the victim of British
prejudice and Greek machinations.
To Mr Rauf Denktash, president of the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus, Mr Nadir's arrival may even seem like a diplomatic
windfall. He may feel inclined to tell the British authorities that, while
he would love to help, the fact that Britain does not recognise his republic
makes matters extraordinarily difficult.
Britain recognises Mr Denktash as leader of the Turkish Cypriot community,
and indeed as vice-president of the Cyprus Republic (a title he no longer
uses). But, along with the rest of the international community - with the
important exception of Turkey - it recognises only one state and one
government in Cyprus, the one elected by the Greek Cypriot majority and now
headed by President Glafkos Clerides.
The Turks have argued ever since 1963, when the late President Makarios
unilaterally amended the constitution in order to override their veto, that
the government is no longer legitimate and represents the Greek population
only. In 1974 Turkey intervened in response to a coup against Archbishop
Makarios by mainland Greek officers, seizing the northern two fifths of the
island and regrouping the Turkish Cypriot population there, while the Greek
inhabitants fled to the south. The de facto partition has remained ever
since, with a UN force policing the line between the two zones.
Mr Denktash, always heavily dependent on mainland Turkish support,
proclaimed the TRNC at a moment of flux in Turkish politics in November
1983, when President Turgut Ozal had just won his first general election and
was about to become prime minister. Mr Nadir later became a close ally of Mr
Ozal, backing him through the newspapers he owned (when other Turkish papers
were almost unanimously hostile) and lending money to his son.
It was widely assumed that Mr Ozal returned the favour by pledging continued
support for Mr Denktash. But the Turkish foreign ministry regarded Mr Ozal
as dangerously soft on the Cyprus issue, especially in 1988 when he appeared
close to doing a deal with Mr Andreas Papandreou, the then Greek prime
minister. More recently, since Mr Nadir's fall, Mr Ozal broke a taboo by
referring publicly to the cost of supporting northern Cyprus for the Turkish
exchequer.
For his part, Mr Suleyman Demirel, the present Turkish prime minister and
now the leading candidate to replace the late Mr Ozal, has rebuked Mr
Denktash for claiming that a quarrel with his prime minister, Mr Dervish
Eroglu, prevented him from negotiating a solution with the Greek Cypriots.
Mr Demirel even pointed out that the total population of northern Cyprus is
less than that of a small provincial town in mainland Turkey.
Only this week, however, Mr Denktash, who had threatened to resign as
negotiator unless the Turkish-Cypriot parliament reaffirmed its faith in
him, obtained a parliamentary resolution in support of the UN-sponsored
peace talks and himself as negotiator.

FT  06 MAY 93 / IRA bomb to cost BAT Pounds 25m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE latest IRA bomb in the City will cost BAT an estimated Pounds 25m in
insurance claims, much more than its Pounds 8m exposure to the 1992 bomb.
The total includes Pounds 10m from commitments to pay the first Pounds
100,000 of claims made under Pool-Re, the scheme established between the
government and insurance industry to cover terrorism. About Pounds 15m
relates to the group's 7 per share of the exposure to the damaged NatWest
Tower.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Swiss Bank tops BZW's cash offer for scrip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWISS Bank Corporation has made a late intervention in BAT's enhanced scrip
dividend scheme, by offering shareholders a higher cash alternative than
BZW.
Under the scheme, formulated by BZW, BAT shareholders were offered a scrip
dividend of 33.9p per share, a 50 per cent premium to the cash dividend of
22.6p announced on March 10.
BZW said that shareholders who wanted cash could take a cash alternative to
the enhanced scrip of 32.2p, free of dealing costs - a 5 per cent discount
to cover the joint broker's risk in underwriting the deal.
Now SBC has said it will offer shareholders a cash alternative of 33.22p per
scrip share, free of dealing costs - a discount of only 2 per cent.
BAT said its attitude to the SBC offer was 'strictly neutral', adding: 'If
they want to make an offer, that is their affair. Our only concern would be
if any confusion arose so late in the timetable.'
BAT shareholders must communicate their decision on the scrip by Tuesday,
and last night nearly 38 per cent of the group's 150,000 shareholders had
already made irrevocable elections.
BZW claimed that SBC's late entry into the process and targeted method of
advertising it - through an advertisement in today's Financial Times -
suggested that SBC was more interested in 'creaming off' institutional
investors, rather than small shareholders.
SBC denied that, and said it had started looking at the scheme because a
large number of its own clients were BAT shareholders. Depending on market
reaction, to this offer, it would consider making similar offers for scrip
of other companies which followed BAT's example.
SBC discussed aspects of the scheme with the Stock Exchange, but its offer
is conditional on approval being granted by the council of the exchange.
The enhanced scrip offered by RTZ Corporation, the mining group which became
the second company to follow BAT's example, was accepted by holders of 89
per cent of the group's shares - more than expected. Only 19 per cent of
those took BZW's cash alternative.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Royal Insurance makes Pounds 404m cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Insurance yesterday surprised the markets with a deeply discounted
one-for-three Pounds 404m rights issue which should enable it to take
advantage of recent rises in insurance rates in the UK and overseas,
News that the group returned to the black in the first quarter, however,
helped calm unease among investors with the shares falling only 9p yesterday
to close at 307p, compared with the rights issue price of 255p.
Pre-tax profits in the first quarter of 1993 amounted to Pounds 2m compared
with a Pounds 48m loss during the same period last year. Royal lost Pounds
679m between 1990 and 1992
'We felt the time was right to take advantage of the market upturn,' said Mr
Richard Gamble, chief executive, who said: 'We have trimmed back
sufficiently and want to maintain the market share that we have. We are not
looking to make any rapid expansion but the capital will support the whole
base of our business.'
The issue has been underwritten by Lazard Brothers and Barings. Brokers to
the issue are SG Warburg Securities and Hoare Govett Corporate Finance. And
the proceeds will be invested directly in Royal's general insurance
business, increasing its solvency by 11 per cent to approximately 54 per
cent.
Although several insurers have raised cash through subordinated bond and
debt issues, Royal is only the second composite insurer to ask its
shareholders for fresh capital. Commercial Union raised Pounds 428m in
February.
'We understand the reasons why they have done it but we are disappointed,'
said Mr David Hudson, analyst with Credit Lyonnais Laing. 'It dilutes the
potential earnings recovery. Without the rights issue the balance sheet
would look a little bit wobbly.'
Royal's first-quarter figures indicate continuing improvement in
underwriting results, especially in the UK where underwriting losses fell to
Pounds 21m compared with Pounds 91m at the same stage last year. Rises in
premium rates, milder weather and a fall in mortgage indemnity losses were
responsible. Underwriting losses in the United States rose to Pounds 65m
(from Pounds 41m).
The new cash could help Royal expand in some markets. Mr Roy Elms,
underwriting director, said opportunities in the commercial risks market
were particularly attractive.
The withdrawal of reinsurance capacity in recent months had lead to a
reduction in competition in this sector.
Royal Global, the subsidiary which specialises in insuring the risks of
multinational companies, has been hampered by its poor security ratings in
the past and should benefit from the injection.
'It will enhance their position when they can say they are part of a company
with a 50 per cent solvency rating,' added Mr Gamble.
Further expansion is also on the cards at The Insurance Service (TIS), the
Gloucester-based 'direct' motor insurer. By contrast sales through brokers,
which generate two-thirds of Royal's motor business, remained static.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Sale of BT shares poised for mid-July
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE sale of the government's shares in BT is to take place in the middle of
July.
Ministers believe the regulatory issues posed by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission investigation into British Gas should not affect the BT sale. The
MMC's report is due in July.
A number of companies planning to go public have already brought forward
their flotations in anticipation of the timing of the BT sale and others
looking at a flotation may now consider going early.
The government yesterday expanded its share shop scheme, established as part
of the second tranche of BT shares sold in 1991.
SG Warburg, the government's global co-ordinator, announced that more than
150 companies with around 10,000 outlets will act as share shops in the
third sale of BT shares. Last time the government selected eight preferred
retailers.
The gap between the close of the retail offer and the book-building exercise
and the start of dealing is to be less than one week.
The marketing campaign will be launched on May 24 after publication of BT's
full year results on May 13. The government is expected to sell most, if not
all, of its 22 per cent BT stake - worth more than Pounds 5bn.
Share shops, including the four big clearing banks, will be entitled to
market their services under the branding of the share shops symbol, a bull
and a bear, and to display the offer logo from the launch of the sale.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said: 'We believe
the share shop scheme will be a major step forward in helping share dealing
services become more accessible to the public.'
Small investors will be able to choose between registering with the
government's share information office or registering with a share shop.
Those registering with and applying through a share shop will receive
greater preference in allocation if there is heavy demand for the shares.
Warburg will be responsible for running the book-building exercise in every
region of the world. Companies with impending floats include RJB Mining, the
Nottinghamshire-based coal mining group, RPC Group, the rigid plastic
packaging company, and Carpetright of London.

FT  06 MAY 93 / BAT ahead 40% but warns of cigarette wars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries, the UK-based tobacco and financial services group, increased
pre-tax profits by 40 per cent in the first quarter, but gave warning that
the US cigarette price war would have an impact on its business.
BAT's pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 258m to Pounds 360m in the three
months to March 31, the period just before the US tobacco group Philip
Morris slashed its prices. Strong insurance premium growth and financial
services profits more than compensated for a slight downturn in tobacco.
The weaker pound boosted the pre-tax profits figure by Pounds 46m. Group
sales grew by 18 per cent to Pounds 6.03bn during the quarter, and earnings
per share were 56 per cent higher at 13.7p.
Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, said: 'The price war is clearly set for a
period of significant aggravation but it remains to be seen how intensive
and how persistent our competitors' activity will be.'
He added: 'Shareholders should keep a sense of perspective: US domestic
tobacco profit accounted for about 20 per cent of the the group's total
trading profit in 1992, down from about 30 per cent in 1991. This trend
illustrates the reduced importance of the US domestic market to the group as
a whole.'
BAT's shares yesterday closed 24p lower at 850p. They have fallen 15 per
cent since Philip Morris's price cut announcement in April.
The group said tobacco trading profit of Pounds 220m was slightly below last
year's strong first quarter, influenced by a number of short-term factors,
which also cut volumes. It blamed a reduced level of anticipatory buying in
the US, a relocation provision at Brown &amp; Williamson, the US cigarette
subsidiary, and a sharp downturn in Germany.
Financial services increased trading profits from continuing operations by
48 per cent, to Pounds 169m. In the general business Farmers, the US
insurance subsidiary, continued to progress and the ongoing recovery at
Eagle Star contributed to a profit of Pounds 93m (up from Pounds 43m). In
the life business, Allied Dunbar, Eagle Star and Farmers all recorded growth
and profits were 7 per cent up at Pounds 76m.
Sir Patrick said: 'The most dramatic part of the improvement came, as
expected, from Eagle Star's general business, where the core business
operations moved back into profit.'
There was a loss of Pounds 29m on domestic mortgage indemnity policies. BAT
said it was encouraged by the recent fall in the number of people in serious
arrears and higher levels of activity in the housing market.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Question mark hangs over Matsushita's largesse: Costly
Philips venture buy-out will strain company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, RONALD VAN DE KROL and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, AMSTERDAM, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was an echo of the good old days about Matsushita's announcement last
week that it was finding billions of yen to buy out Philips of the
Netherlands from their ailing semiconductor joint venture.
Matsushita will pay Y185bn (Pounds 1.08bn) - in cash by the end of the month
 -for Philips' 35 per cent stake in the venture which ranks 10th in the
world league of semiconductor producers, well behind the industry's US
leaders.
Only two and a half years ago Matsushita, the world's largest consumer
electronics group, paid Dollars 6.1bn (Pounds 3.96bn) for MCA, the Hollywood
film company, in a bold move to marry entertainment to its core televisions,
video recorders and audio equipment business.
The scale of the transactions is their only similarity. The MCA acquisition
seemed to symbolise Matsushita's determination to internationalise and buy
growth.
The purchase of Philips' stake in their joint-venture, the Matsushita
Electronics Corporation, heavily involved in commodity chip production,
seems to have been largely forced on a reluctant Matsushita by Philips'
desire to get out.
Philips' motivation was financial; the only surprise is that the Dutch
company is getting such a hefty sum for its shares.
But the more intriguing question is why Matsushita, facing a 60 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits, was prepared to pay so much for what appears so
little? The company faces a sharp downturn in Japanese consumer spending,
compounded by loss of export competitiveness after the yen's rise against
the US dollar.
This downturn has amplified structural changes in its main consumer markets.
About a fifth of Matsushita's sales come from television and video
recorders. Markets for these products in developed countries are saturated.
New products such as high-definition television have not taken off.
The disappointing record of HDTV is one reason why Matsushita's purchase of
MCA has been less successful than hoped.
The scale and complexity of Matsushita's operations - it has 315
subsidiaries - combined with its conservative management mean it is unlikely
to cut costs or restructure aggressively, in spite of a management
reshuffle.
Indeed, the deal with Philips may add to the impression of Matsushita being
driven by events.
Mr Dudley Eustace, Philips' finance director, declined to say yesterday how
large a book profit the Dutch company could expect on the deal. Analysts,
who estimate Philips stands to show a gain of between Fl 500m (Pounds 180m)
and Fl 1bn, are confident the group will now be able to report a substantial
profit for 1993.
The partnership, established in 1952, has not brought Philips the access to
Asian markets it once hoped for. By contrast, benefits for Matsushita are
harder to fathom.
Matsushita says the venture, with plants in Europe, the US, south east Asia
and China, was suffering from cumbersome decision making. It thought Philips
may have been wary of sanctioning heavy investment.
By severing the partnership Matsushita will now be able to compete for
semiconductor business in Europe against Philips.
Matsushita is in a much stronger financial position than Philips. But the
deal will add to growing strain on its balance sheet. Its gearing for last
year is likely to be above 40 per cent.
In addition, Matsushita will now have to carry all the burden of investment
in MEC, when other semiconductor makers are increasingly relying on
alliances to cut costs and risks.
Several factors could explain why Matsushita decided to pay such a high
price for the stake.
Matsushita may see something in MEC no one else can spot. Matsushita may
have feared Philips would obstruct the venture's development or worse try to
sell its stake to a competitor. Far more important for both companies are
collaborations in new products such as compact disc interactive.
But some fear Matsushita has not learned from the experience of paying so
much for MCA. As one western analyst in Tokyo put it: 'They still think they
are rich enough to pay too much for assets they want. It could have been
strategic but it could be that old habits die hard.'

FT  06 MAY 93 / Rise of 1.6% in house prices is highest for four years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES in the UK rose by 1.6 per cent in April, the largest monthly
increase for more than four years, Halifax Building Society said yesterday.
The country's biggest mortgage lender said the seasonally adjusted figures
'could be a sign that house prices may well start to increase earlier than
most analysts have anticipated'.
Further evidence of a revival in house sales also emerged yesterday from the
Council of Mortgage Lenders, which said there had been an upswing in home
loans since the beginning of the year.
More than 216,000 loans worth a total of Pounds 11.8bn were approved by
building societies and banks during January, February and March, the council
said. This represented an increase in both the number and value of loans of
more than 25 per cent over the final three months of last year, and was only
marginally lower than during the first three months of last year. It said
that lending figures traditionally lagged increases in sales which have
recently been reported by builders and estate agents.
Mr Mark Boleat, the council's director-general said: 'The sharp pick-up in
the number and value of approvals is particularly encouraging, corroborating
signs elsewhere of a return of household confidence. With evidence of a
recovery in the wider economy becoming increasingly apparent, the likelihood
is for a further solid improvement in housing market activity over the
coming months.'
The seasonally adjusted increase in house prices in April was the biggest
recorded by Halifax since November 1988 and followed a 1.4 per cent rise
reported by the society in March.
Actual increases in house prices during April were even higher with the
average cost of a home rising by 2.6 per cent from Pounds 61,510 to Pounds
63,144.
The price of an average home was still 2.3 per cent lower than during April
last year.
The society said: 'We continue to believe the recovery will not be strong -
certainly no boom is in prospect - and will only be maintained if house
sellers continue to set realistic prices for their properties. It is
probable now that house prices will show a small increase in 1993 as a whole
and could rise in line with average earnings in the economy next year.'

FT  06 MAY 93 / CBI chief calls for changes in financing of small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
yesterday outlined a six-point plan to change the way small businesses are
financed in Britain.
He said urgent action was needed to reduce the casualty rate from cash-flow
problems as the economy recovered from recession.
Mr Davies said clearing banks, which in the 1980s overlent to small
businesses, were now in danger of making as big a mistake by overtightening
their lending rules.
'We ought to be trying to move faster towards a more flexible form of small
business finance,' he told northern members of the British Venture Capital
Association in Manchester.
His proposals are to form the basis for developing a more formal CBI policy
in the next few weeks.
The points were:
Speed up payment of money owing to small businesses by big companies and the
public sector, often the worst offender. Mr Davies said all companies and
public bodies should follow the CBI's code of conduct, which encouraged
prompt payment.
Wider use of factoring, where companies sell their invoices to finance
houses, often subsidiaries of banks, which then collect the money. 'The
attraction is that it would force banks to take a more direct interest in
small businesses and to understand the strength of their customer base,' Mr
Davies added.
Banks should be more willing to swap debt for equity.
The venture capital industry should look at its investment pattern, in which
64 per cent of funds go into management buy-outs, only 4 per cent into
start-ups, 3 per cent into early stage funding and 4 per cent into
refinancing bank debt. These last three categories needed a bigger share of
money available, he said.
A replacement for the Business Expansion Scheme which, Mr Davies said, had
acted as a middle-class tax-shelter and had been abused, with funds going to
ventures such as wine cellars. It should apply only to investment in a new
type of local investment company, through which small business 'angels'
could take stakes in targeted ventures. A successor to the Unlisted
Securities Market, which the stock exchange wants to abolish but has
temporarily reprieved while alternatives are considered.
Mr Davies said there had to be an easier way of going public than the
costlier route of obtaining a full listing. Something like the USM was
needed to assist quick and easy exits for equity stakeholders in successful
small businesses.
He also called for wider tax relief on investments in growing businesses
where realised profits were reinvested in other new unquoted businesses - a
Budget proposal watered down in the Finance Bill.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Government's school tests hit by second resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT plans for school tests for 14-year-olds suffered another setback
yesterday when a second adviser resigned from the council drawing up the
tests.
Dr John Marenbon decided to leave the Schools Examinations and Assessment
Council after a disagreement over assessing schoolchildren's understanding
of English.
His departure follows the resignation of Lord Skidelsky on Tuesday in
protest at the government's handling of its review of the national
curriculum.
In his resignation letter, Dr Marenbon, who chaired the council's English
committee, described the tests, which two teachers' unions are boycotting,
as 'inadequate and unfair'.
He said: 'I have made repeated requests that this paper be postponed and
carefully rewritten.' Dr Marenbon is fellow of English at Trinity College,
Cambridge, and a leading supporter of the national curriculum's proposed new
emphasis on traditional 'classic' works.
He described the timetable for the tests as 'impossible', and told Mr Patten
that many of his advisers were 'too keen to tell you what they believe you
want to hear'.
Mr Patten said he was 'extremely surprised and sorry' to receive Dr
Marenbon's resignation. However, he said the tests should go ahead as it
would be the last chance for 14-year-olds to be assessed before sitting
their GCSE examinations.
The SEAC also reacted with anger, saying it had not disregarded Dr
Marenbon's advice. It said the tests had been drawn up to Mr Patten's
specification and that 'leading Shakespearean scholars' had been consulted.
It said: 'Dr Marenbon's views on these tests, though valuable, have to be
set against those of other experts.'
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of
Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, which is boycotting the tests, said:
'The whole exercise is in complete disarray.'
Ms Ann Taylor, Labour's education spokesman, said: 'This second resignation
in two days shows how isolated the secretary of state has become. Now we
learn that he does not even listen to his own hand-picked advisers.'

GOVERNMENT proposals on insider dealing will 'seriously undermine the flow
of communication between companies and brokers and analysts and
journalists', Mr Davies said yesterday, writes Ian Hamilton Fazey.
The government is expected to publish the final wording of the insider
dealing clauses in the Criminal Justice Bill this week, but Mr Davies urged
more time to think again.
'Nothing could be worse for the improved understanding of companies'
strategy by investors than a fear that practices now considered legitimate
might be a matter for prosecution,' he told members of the British Venture
Capital Association.

FT  06 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar House
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hongkong Land's coup looks pretty well complete now that it has secured four
places on the Trafalgar House board, including those of chairman and finance
director. It has done so, moreover, with a stake of just 25 per cent that
conveniently allows it to equity-account the holding but does not it oblige
it to consolidate. In other circumstances, a rise to such dominance without
a full bid might have provoked howls of protest. Trafalgar's intractable
troubles presumably prompted the institutions to acquiesce in this case.
Besides, they have the consolation of a share price more than double last
year's low.
The precedent is disturbing just the same. This could be a new beginning for
Trafalgar House, but it will not become another Bechtel overnight. Cash flow
is under pressure and disposals are as remote as ever. Hongkong Land will
not automatically repeat the miracle it has wrought at Kwik Save. One has to
hope it succeeds. If not, other shareholders will lack the power to obtain
redress.

<TEXT>
BAT's shares have fallen by nearly 9 per cent since Philip Morris put a
torch to the cigarette price war. As the battle is unlikely to spread beyond
the US, and only 20 per cent of BAT's operating profits come from its
domestic US tobacco operations, that looks excessive. Yet until Philip
Morris's strategy becomes clearer and the impact on discount as well as
premium brands better understood, tobacco companies may remain under
pressure. The turn in the insurance market may thus not be reflected in
BAT's share price for some time. But with a 50 per cent yield premium to the
market and dividend cover climbing back towards two, further falls must
surely be limited.

FT  06 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Tate &amp; Lyle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market has never been sure how to value Tate &amp; Lyle. A string of canny
deals and a spell of rigorous management in the 1980s almost convinced it
that Tate's commodity sweetener businesses deserved a premium rating. But
Tate's misfortunes in the US last year dispelled that delusion. The shares
have bounced since but now seem merely to be tracking the dull food sector.
Tate's 20 per cent interim profits increase hints that a reassessment of its
rating may be due. But once currency translation gains and the benefits of
the green pound's devaluation are stripped out, the underlying earnings
progress is lacklustre. The trouble is that it may not get much easier from
here. Despite steadily improving cash flow, gearing will still be about 80
per cent at the year end, inhibiting debt-funded expansion. Paper may be
issued. But since food assets in developed countries generally command
higher multiples than Tate, that would threaten earnings dilution. Tate may
therefore focus on developing countries, where assets are cheaper. That,
however, will only raise questions about the quality of earnings, further
impeding a rerating. Tate is not alone among UK food manufacturers in
confronting this growth conundrum; it is, though, experiencing the pressure
more acutely than most.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With its shares trading at a premium of 54 per cent to net assets, Royal
Bank of Scotland has little need to worry about a bid from Lloyds or any
other bank for that matter. The question is whether its performance will
continue to justify a yield of only 4.2 per cent. On the plus side is Direct
Line, whose first-half contribution more than trebled compared with the same
period of 1992. RBS is adamant that it has no plans to float off Direct
Line. Presumably, it could change its mind if flotation became necessary to
support its own share price.
Less clear is the message from its traditional banking business. A 32 per
cent increase in operating profit before provisions is impressive and the
bank expects provisions to fall in the second half. But there is also the
prospect of a Pounds 35m charge from the sale of Charterhouse in the
full-year figures as well as a possible hit from property revaluation. RBS
managed a striking Pounds 650m increase in its mortgage portfolio, which
helps employ its surplus capital. But costs have also grown sharply, while
the quadrupling of spreads on mortgage lending is unlikely to be repeated.
The trouble with having too much capital is that management has to work all
the harder to produce a decent return. At less than 12 per cent, RBS has not
reached that point yet.

FT  06 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Putting Royal to rights
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is at least arguable that George Soros has done more than the Royal
Insurance management to pull the company's fat out of the fire. Were
sterling still in the ERM and interest rates around 10 per cent, Royal would
scarcely be back in the FT-SE 100 or asking shareholders for Pounds 404m at
255p a share. To be fair, the new team has imposed some useful discipline.
But it is unclear to what extent the recovery in underwriting is a function
of the improving market rather than management action. Bruised shareholders
are meanwhile left to reflect on the Pounds 679m of pre-tax losses in the
last three years and the Pounds 1.2bn of shareholders' funds which have
evaporated from the balance sheet. Some may even think that a management
asking for over Pounds 400m on the strength of scraping a quarterly profit
of Pounds 2m is being a trifle opportunistic.
Patching balance sheet holes and raising the company's solvency margin are
clearly strong motives for the issue. Last year, Royal made strenuous
efforts to persuade the City to include the value of its life business in
calculating solvency margins, to limited effect. Royal has still lost
international commercial business to competitors as a result of its weaker
capital base.
That will be less of a problem now. Direct line personal operations and the
Royal Global's commercial business can make some use of the cash. It is that
happy moment early in the roller-coaster insurance cycle after the excess
capital has been lost and when money can be made from rising premiums before
the market gets crowded. But crowded it will get. After 'one-off' issues
from CU and Royal, it may only be a matter of time before another composite
insurer jumps out of the window of opportunity.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Maastricht skirmishes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS hard for any normal British citizen to understand the Byzantine
legalistic wrangles between the government and its opponents during the
House of Commons' interminable debates over the Maastricht treaty. But it is
becoming increasingly difficult to resist the feeling that the parliamentary
procedures which have been on display are unbecoming to parliament and
profoundly ill-adapted to the ratification of this kind of international
agreement.
The first reason for unease is that these procedures are in fact demeaning
to the working of British democracy. The House of Commons prides itself on
its reputation as the mother of parliaments, sovereign in all things. But it
should be a cardinal rule of a model parliament that the legal significance
of its debates should be clearly comprehensible, at least to the
participants, and certainly to the government.
This is not the case here. In February, the government produced two
contradictory legal judgments on the consequences of a defeat on the social
chapter: first (from the Foreign Office) that it would wreck the whole
treaty, and second (from the attorney-general) that it would have no effect
on the treaty at all.
In principle the attorney-general's advice should carry the greatest weight;
yet it has entirely failed to silence continued legal argument, or to
introduce any real clarity into the consequences of the continued
parliamentary skirmishing.
Some opponents of the treaty seem to believe they could yet challenge
Maastricht in the courts of law; other experts deny that such a judicial
challenge would be feasible. On grounds of democratic principle, it would
seem most undesirable that a judge, however eminent, should decide a
political question which ought to have been settled by the elected
representatives of the people.
The dismay of the ordinary voter does not end here, however. By common
consent, both of its supporters and of its opponents, Maastricht is an
ambitious treaty which could have far-reaching consequences for Britain and
Europe. But many British voters will have been surprised and even shocked to
observe that the ratification process in the House of Commons does not seem
to grapple with these large European policy issues at all.
On the contrary, most of parliament's attention, and most of its legislative
power, seems to be focused narrowly on those bits of the treaty which would
have direct legislative consequences in Britain itself. The Conservative
Euro-sceptics and the opposition parties have tried to derail the treaty by
overthrowing the social protocol. But the government is astonishingly
entitled to maintain, by some extraordinary anachronism, that ratification
proper is merely a matter of the royal prerogative.
This procedure has had the effect of avoiding the main issues, while
fuelling a phony trench war between parliamentary factions on endless
technicalities. The fact that the government, even when defeated on a
substantial issue like the social chapter, can claim to ignore it reveals
the dishonesty of the entire exercise. The mother of parliaments is going to
have to work out a more effective relationship with the EC if it is to have
any hope of representing its citizens' concerns effectively.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YEAR AFTER weary year leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries
agree to complete the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations and
fail to do so. The contrast between their protestations and their
achievements is ridiculous. Can anything be done to bring their actions in
line with their words?
Only last week, for example, the G7's finance ministers and central bank
governors stated that 'the further opening of the international trading
system is indispensable for maximising world growth. A successful growth
strategy requires prompt and appropriate conclusion of the Uruguay Round.
Protectionism retards growth and must be resisted.' Meanwhile, President
Clinton himself pledged 'exceptional actions' to bring about such an
agreement.
So why has the round already taken six and a half years with no end in
sight? The answer is that the leaders do not mean what they say. More
precisely, they mean only half of what they say. They think it would be
wonderful for the Uruguay Round to be crowned by the liberalisation of the
trade policies of every country except their own. No wonder they find it so
difficult to agree.
Leaders need to be reminded about the chief purpose of trade, which is to
widen opportunities for consumption. The report published this morning by
the UK's publicly funded National Consumer Council provides such a reminder.
It argues, for example, that EC consumers will pay an average of Pounds 740
extra for each Japanese car as a result of the export restraint agreed by
Japan; that anti-dumping duties on electronics goods cost EC consumers some
Pounds 1.3bn a year; and that the common agricultural policy raises the food
bill of the average family of four by over Pounds 17 a week.
Protection saves jobs, say its protagonists. This is a myth, counters the
NCC. Jobs may be saved in one industry, but at the expense of jobs
elsewhere. Just as mythical is the rather newer idea that free trade
threatens the environment. Anyone who knows anything about the former
communist countries will recognise this as nonsense. Poverty is an important
cause of environmental degradation, while opportunities to trade are among
the most important routes from poverty.
Most of the NCC's recommendations fall into two categories. In the first are
those for liberalisation - of the common agricultural policy, for example.
In the second are those for transparency and accountability.
How, for example, has it been possible for EC governments to make the
Japanese form export cartels against EC consumers? How has it been possible
to impose high anti-dumping duties without public fuss? The answer is that
neither policy has been open to public debate and assessment. The most
important NCC recommendation may, therefore, be its call for an independent
body to undertake the evaluation of trade policy measures. Its proposed
right of access to non-confidential information for consumer representatives
could prove equally important.
So long as even well-intentioned policy-makers are locked in a struggle with
narrow producer groups, they will grant protection, while calling for
liberalisation. The NCC suggests governments should empower consumer bodies
to participate in the debate. This would help consumers. But it would also
help governments themselves to do what they know they ought to do.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Jumping bail
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ASIL Nadir's escape to Northern Cyprus will not only anger thousands of
Polly Peck shareholders. It will also further undermine confidence in the
capacity of the UK criminal justice system to bring serious fraud cases to
successful conclusions.
Confidence has already been damaged by fiascos such as the Blue Arrow and
Guinness trials. While the precise anatomy of failure varies in all three
situations, common elements have been the complexity of the charge sheets
and the inordinate delay in bringing cases to trial. In Mr Nadir's case,
there has been a delay of two and a half years since he was charged.
One can only speculate whether an earlier trial would have deterred Mr Nadir
from jumping bail. But it does seem certain that, so long as it takes
several years to bring serious fraud cases to trial, little can be done to
prevent defendants from escaping unless society is willing to ride roughshod
over their human rights.
Mr Nadir's bail of Pounds 3.5m was already the largest imposed in the UK.
Putting him - and others in a similar position - behind bars for six months
while awaiting trial might be acceptable. Locking them up for three years
would not be, especially since they could eventually be found not guilty.
Mr Nadir's escape was facilitated by the willingness of Northern Cyprus, a
state which Britain and almost all other countries refuse to recognise, to
provide him with a safe haven. There is therefore little chance of bringing
Mr Nadir back to face justice, although the government of Northern Cyprus
should not think that welcoming him with open arms is a cost-free decision.
It is precisely such behaviour which will prevent it receiving the
recognition it craves.
The lesson for future fraud cases is clear. The Serious Fraud Office must
streamline charge sheets and bring cases to court much more quickly. Only
then will the prosecuting authorities be able to justify denying future
Nadirs bail.

Forget 30 per cent inflation a month, competitive decline and mounting home
debt, the president of Brazil, Itamar Franco, is pre-occupied with a more
pressing worry. It's that Rio de Janeiro's 20,000 taxis have taken to
displaying his photograph on the price tables carried in their windows.
The idea was the response of Rio's mayor to a survey showing that a lot of
Brazilians didn't know who their president was. So out went the beach scenes
and so on normally fronting the price lists issued monthly to account for
inflation, and up went Franco's photo.
Whereas most politicians would welcome the citywide parade of their image,
he was livid. Seeing it as a sneaky way of blaming him for price increases,
he demanded that the pictures be removed . . . only to have the mayor
decline, saying they were tokens of Rio's homage to the president.
But Franco was not to be mollified. He has now issued a government decree
ordering taxi-drivers to white out the photos on pain of a fine.
Some are saying he'd be better trying to wipe out the inflation instead.

The Beijing restaurateurs who have pooled together to compete with invading
fast-food chains have surely missed a trick. They should have called their
new joint venture Donald's.
After all, it is duck they're relying on to win back market share from the
hamburgers and such of chief interloper McDonald's, along with Kentucky
Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut and numerous others.
The city now has about 300 junk-food sellers whose mostly foreign-style
wares go down increasingly well with the 1.5m floating population.
In their counterattack, the plucky Beijingers are planning three quick-roast
outlets in the capital and eventually 50 elsewhere.
In addition to the backing of municipal authorities, they have keen support
from nearby farmers looking to feather their nests on extra demand for the
ducks which take around two months to fatten to a standard weight of 3.4kg.
Moreover, while the new venture's promoters may have missed the ideal name,
there's still a touch of western marketing hype in the one they have chosen.
Even though they have apparently not yet cracked the problem of making the
duck not just fast but flavoursome, they have called the company Quanjude
which means 'all virtuous'.

The sudden exit of yet another senior figure from Invesco MIM - Peter
Knapton, in charge of the UK wholesale business - leaves the fund management
group with an even greater gaping hole on the UK side of the now mainly
American business.
Since the middle of last year almost half of the staff at director level on
the UK side have gone. By all accounts, the Devonshire Square office has
been an even more unhappy shop since the departure the other week of finance
director Ratan Engineer and half a dozen other colleagues.
It is felt that Norman Riddell, the new boss of the European operations, has
been keeping rather too low a profile amid all the unpleasantness.
Now Invesco is holding its breath to see what sort of fine Imro will impose
at the end of the self-regulatory body's long-running investigation.
But when Invesco next has some cash to spare, the only sensible way to
restore the tattered UK business - if that is what the Georgia-based
executive chairman Charles Brady decides he wants to do - is by acquisition.
Observer does not know how well Riddell gets on with his former stablemates
at Capital House, the Royal Bank of Scotland subsidiary which he set up and
subsequently left to join Invesco, but it would be an obvious port of call
if and when RBS shows any inclination to sell.
Trouble is, there is little point in an acquisition until the Invesco name
becomes somewhat less of a liability.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Norman Lamont should be mopping his brow over the fate of City economist
Paul Temperton. Unlike the chancellor, who kept his job after September's
hiccup on the foreign exchanges, Temperton has succumbed to a row at least
partly linked to questions of turbulent currencies.
A strong supporter of the European exchange rate mechanism, the 34-year-old
has just left his job as head of international economics at the London
office of Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank.
Right up to Black Wednesday, he was confident Britain would stay in the ERM.
Then when events proved him as wrong as the UK government, he had trouble
persuading Merrill Lynch colleagues to accept his line that the French franc
would resist further devaluation pressures within the mechanism.
True, on the franc at least, Temperton has so far been right. But the former
Bank of England economist's chagrin increased when a change of house view on
the currency was forced through by Merrill's New York office.
The upshot is that he and his employer have agreed to end their seven years
together. He is setting up on his own as an economic researcher, in
collaboration with consultancy Oxford Economic Forecasting which hopes his
move will increase its reputation in the City.
The effect on his earnings, alas, is in the other direction.

FT  06 MAY 93 / A trolley full of troubles: Private-label products are
threatening established brands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since Philip Morris, the world's largest tobacco manufacturer, slashed the
US price of Marlboro cigarettes last month in the face of falling sales,
jitters have spread to many other branded consumer goods producers. If this
could happen to a company as formidable as Philip Morris, observers have
asked, is anybody safe?
Pessimists have not lacked evidence for their case. The growing competition
from retailers' cheap private-label products which humbled Marlboro has
recently prompted other US brand leaders, including Procter &amp; Gamble, Kraft
and Quaker Oats, to cut prices or shelve planned increases.
The private-label challenge has also gained further impetus from Wal-Mart,
the largest US discount retailer. Wal-Mart, which has in the past sold few
non-branded goods, recently launched its own 'Great Value' range of 350 food
and drink products aimed at under-cutting popular brands.
Optimists argue that private-label has long prospered in US recessions, as
shoppers tightened their belts. Once the economy improved, consumers have
invariably returned to buying favourite household names at premium prices.
But will they do so as readily again? Though most industry experts dismiss
suggestions that brands are doomed, several developments suggest that their
manufacturers face a longer and tougher struggle than in the past.
Some of the developments are peculiar to the US. But others appear linked to
much broader trends which are reshaping consumer goods competition
worldwide. Indeed, European experience may hold some lessons for the US.
Private-label's share of total US grocery sales is hard to measure, partly
because it varies between products. In breakfast cereals, it has only 5 per
cent of the market, but in cheese slices it accounts for 26 per cent,
according to Nielsen, the market research company.
None the less, it appears to have made deeper inroads than in previous
downturns. Kroger, the largest US grocery chain, says it is between 18 per
cent and 20 per cent of group sales, compared with 16 per cent in the 1981
recession. Furthermore, it has continued to flourish even though US economic
recovery got under way last autumn.
Recent market research surveys suggest private-label is also increasingly
popular with prosperous shoppers. This finding supports the popular view
that consumers of all kinds are increasingly concerned with value - a trend
which many experts expect to persist through the decade. 'Value has become
the smart choice,' says Kroger. 'The only question is how far the
private-label trend will go.'
Yet some manufacturers, such as Philip Morris, have been slow to draw the
consequences. Indeed, they have encouraged cut-price competition by
regularly raising prices ahead of inflation in the belief that their brands
were strong enough to keep consumers loyal.
But that loyalty has often been strained by marketing tactics intended to
boost short-term sales rather than strengthen brands. Since 1980, US food
manufacturers' spending on promotional schemes, such as money-off offers and
coupons, has risen from half to three-quarters of total marketing budgets,
while advertising's share has fallen from 44 per cent to 25 per cent.
In practice, as much as a third of promotional spending consists of
inducements to supermarkets to stock goods. The proliferation of special
offers which the money has also funded is widely blamed for weakening brands
by producing frequent sharp price fluctuations and wide disparities between
price levels across the country.
Last year, P&amp;G sought to impose discipline by reducing promotional spending
and cutting prices by as much as 25 per cent to a uniform national level.
But the results have been mixed. This month, P&amp;G again cut sharply prices of
disposable nappies, of which it is the leading producer, in an effort to
beat back mounting private-label competition.
Many other large branded US manufacturers are also counting on more
aggressive pricing to regain market share. However, the tactic involves
risks. In the short term it can depress margins, unless off-setting cost
cuts can be found. An even bigger challenge is how to re-establish a premium
market position for brands which have been forced to compete heavily on
price.
Some leading manufacturers, including H J Heinz and Campbell's Soup, are
hedging their bets by also producing for private-label. Most say they refuse
to do so in categories where they are market leaders, so as to limit
competition with their own brands. However, some industry experts argue
that, unless a manufacturer completely dominates a product category, it can
be hard to straddle both businesses successfully for long.
Challenges of this kind have long faced suppliers on the other side of the
Atlantic, whose experience may offer pointers to future trends in the US.
Private-label groceries are well established in Europe and have gained
ground in recent years. In many northern countries they account for between
a fifth and a third of the market.
In reality, private-label covers a wide spectrum of goods and marketing
practices. In Germany, it is still largely confined - as it has
traditionally been in the US - to discount generic products such as toilet
paper, often of inferior quality.
But in Britain, chains such as Marks and Spencer, J Sainsbury and Tesco have
developed sophisticated private-label ranges, which earn high margins and
sometimes sell at a premium over branded lines. Many Continental retailers,
particularly in France, are now trying to emulate their example.
Private-label products are still dismissed by some brand leaders as cheap
imitations. 'When they flourish, it usually means branded marketeers are
dozing,' says Mr Michael Perry, chairman of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch
consumer products group. His solution is to 'keep moving the goalposts'
through faster product innovation.
However, UK supermarkets have been innovators in some fast-growing areas,
such as chilled convenience meals. They also increasingly control the
development, quality standards and marketing of the products they sell,
turning many private-label suppliers into little more than contract
processors. Above all, they have transformed their own names into powerful
brands.
Will the US follow the same pattern? Sceptics point out that supermarkets
there wield less clout than in most of Europe, partly because regulatory
restrictions have kept the industry fragmented and prevented national chains
emerging. The industry has also to recover from the turbulence created in
the 1980s by a wave of leveraged buy-outs which has saddled many groups with
heavy debt.
None the less, there is evidence that US private-label ranges are shedding
their traditionally dowdy image. Safeway, for instance, recently
reformulated its soft drinks line and says it is now faring much better
against Coca-Cola and Pepsi, which lost share to private-label rivals last
year. One recent survey found that many consumers ranked the quality of many
private-label goods equal to branded lines.
In part this trend may be due to the influence of European retailers such as
Ahold of the Netherlands, Delhaize of Belgium and Sainsbury, which have
acquired US supermarket groups in the past few years.
Since Sainsbury bought Shaws, a New England chain, it has concentrated on
up-market private-label products carrying the Shaws name. The supermarket
sells about 1,200 such items and added 300 lines last year. However, the
formula has yet to improve profitability. Last year, Shaws' margins of 2 per
cent were only a quarter of its UK parent's.
Whether or not the private-label challenge continues to grow, many branded
US manufacturers expect leaner times on their home market. A recent survey
of more than 100 big American consumer goods companies by McKinsey, the
management consultancy, found they expected sales abroad to grow twice as
fast as in the US in the first half of this decade.
Four-fifths of companies also said their overall success in the next five
years depended heavily on international growth - up from half in the past
five years. The clear message is that, whatever the fate of brands in the
US, producers elsewhere can expect tougher competition.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Personal View: Fossil fuel levy fails efficiency test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID NEWBERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-awaited Department of Trade and Industry white paper on coal
reaffirms 'the government's aim of a market-based policy for energy', with a
preference for taxes and subsidies rather than directives and prohibitions.
Given that national security has already been achieved by the current
diversity of fuel supply, generators should be free to buy in the cheapest
market. British coal must compete with imports, and will need a transitional
subsidy until the industry is privatised.
The government's stated objective of bringing efficiency in energy policy
makes sense, but there is one area in which it has failed by its own
standard. Efficiency requires sensible taxes as well as competitive markets,
and the fossil fuel levy (FFL) fails that test.
A report by the Trade and Industry select committee calculated that the FFL
would eventually collect Pounds 9.1bn, primarily to meet the inherited
liabilities of Nuclear Electric (including reprocessing, radioactive waste
management and decommissioning), estimated at Pounds 9.3bn. It recommended
that both the liabilities and the FFL income be transferred from Nuclear
Electric's accounts. Both the coal review and the select committee agreed
that existing nuclear power stations should continue to operate, so the FFL
will in effect pay for past mistakes, not current operations.
If the FFL is needed only to pay for past mistakes, how should the revenue
be collected? A good tax would fall on final consumers, as taxes on
producers involve additional costs, because consumer prices are not only
raised (as with any tax), but the tax also distorts production decisions,
which further raises costs. If ICI was forced to close its chlorine plant
because the FFL increases electricity prices, that would be an additional
cost that could have been avoided if the tax had fallen only on final
consumers, as value-added tax would.
The obvious solution is to replace the FFL with VAT on electricity. The FFL
currently raises about Pounds 1.3bn a year, while the value of domestic
electricity consumption is roughly Pounds 7.6bn. VAT on electricity would
raise Pounds 1.33bn, almost the same as the FFL. Replacing the FFL (10 per
cent) by VAT (17 1/2 per cent) would raise the domestic electricity price by
about 6 per cent, but this would be returned in the form of lower prices or
higher profits from goods produced with electricity. VAT could be extended
to other domestic fuels to avoid a bias against electricity, giving the
government about Pounds 1bn extra revenue.
In the Budget, the Treasury accepted the logic of VAT on electricity, but
made it additional to the FFL, rather than replacing it. Holly Sutherland of
Cambridge University's Department of Applied Economics has shown that
increases in domestic electricity prices have very adverse effects on the
poor. Double taxation of VAT and FFL is particularly harmful.
There would be two immediate benefits from changing to VAT, correcting two
shortcomings of the white paper. First, Electricite de France (EdF) exports
'non-leviable' electricity to Britain through the cross-Channel link,
meaning that the levy collected is paid to EdF. These payments were Pounds
95m in 1991-92. The select committee wished to stop them, but the government
believes that may be illegal. It makes no sense to pay France Pounds 95m a
year just to finance past British mistakes. If it is illegal to remove the
non-leviable status, the problem can be avoided by abolishing the FFL, and
moving Nuclear Electric's liabilities to the Treasury.
Second, the select committee suggested that larger users pay a lower and
decreasing percentage of the FFL. The government accepts that certain large
UK electricity users may be at a competitive disadvantage compared with
their foreign counterparts, but responded with the fallacious argument that
it would not be right to oblige smaller consumers to subsidise large users.
The FFL is not a cost, only a device to recover revenue. It is good practice
to exempt all producers, not just large producers, from such taxes. VAT
automatically does that, and goes some way to removing an avoidable
distortion in the electricity market.
Doubtless other distortions remain, of which the most important is that
created by the market power of the two large generators. The high costs of
the pool and the misallocation of the costs of security of grid supply to
large users make matters worse. These at least are subject to review, while
the design of the tax system is completely under government control, and
should be addressed urgently.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Letter: Ozal had few options in his relationship with EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MR J P VAN RIJ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Mortimer's article about Turgut Ozal's funeral ('Friend when in
need', April 28) deserves some comment, in particular on the small but
significant incident in EC-Turkish relations to which he refers.
President Jacques Delors of the EC Commission was accused in 1989 by many
Turkish personalities of wanting to reserve EC membership to the Christian
countries of Europe. What happened in reality was that Delors, speaking
before the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe on September 26
1989, referred to Fernand Braudel's remark that Europe's common destination
is determined by its Christian religion as one element among several which
he named.
In the immediately following press conference a Turkish journalist lifted
the Christian religion out of the context of the speech and asked if this
was meant as a message for Muslim Turkey. Delors categorically denied such
intention and explained that he had simply referred to factors that had
contributed to Europe's cultural identity, such as Christianity, Roman law,
Greek humanism and Arab civilisation.
Ozal could never have 'courted this reaction when he slammed in Turkey's EC
application in 1987', as Mortimer says, because it took place more than two
years later. Neither do I agree that Demirel is 'more sincerely . . .
European' in going for a customs union. Turkey has not many political
options and the Europeans know that. It is, in a manner of speaking, in
Europe but not of Europe. Turkey's customs union with the EC (not invented
by Demirel but offered to Turkey by the EC in 1990) is the only realistic
basis for a stable and long-lasting relationship in which the EC is not
demandeur. Politics are often hard and merciless; Ozal would have been the
first one to admit that. Symbolic gestures at the occasion of a state
funeral of an important president seldom go beyond the perceived balance of
interests of countries concerned. That explains the level of European
presence at Turgut Ozal's funeral.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Green shoots that sprout problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few will deny that green shoots are at last springing up everywhere in the
UK economy. This is hardly a matter on which the British government should
congratulate itself.
As the EC economics commissioner Henning Christophersen remarked: 'There is
nothing astonishing' about the recovery. 'It would be much more catastrophic
if there was no sign of recovery in the UK after a long period of negative
growth.'
The present recovery presents one big puzzle and may present one big policy
problem. The puzzle is why unemployment has fallen in the past two months, a
movement confirmed by the vacancy statistics. This is much earlier than
normal. In the typical cycle unemployment continues to increase well into
the upward phase of the business cycle until slack is absorbed and labour
shortages develop.
Changed practices at government employment offices by officials anxious to
establish a good end-year record in reducing the register may have made a
contribution. Demographic forces may also explain some of the difference
between the present behaviour of the labour market and that of the early
1980s. Yet the demographic change has been known for a very long time and
did not prevent most forecasters from expecting rising unemployment for the
greater part of 1993.
The best way to treat individual monthly figures is neither to ignore them,
nor to take them at face value, but to see what differences they make to a
longer trend. If you take the past three months together, unemployment has
been falling by a monthly average of 11,000. If you take the past six months
it has been rising at a monthly rate of 17,000. The probability is that the
trend is now flat, if not slightly better.
A similar impression is given by the April Confederation of British Industry
survey. This shows a remarkable drop in the percentage of respondents saying
they are working below capacity, from 73 per cent to 63 per cent; too large
a change to be explained by spring seasonal factors. Indeed capacity
utilisation is now nearly back to the average of a normal non-recession
year.
Whether the early change in the unemployment trend is good news depends on
the reasons for it. The worst reason would be that productivity gains have
started to falter and that more workers were required to sustain a modest
increase in output.
A more optimistic explanation is that the recovery is faster than
preliminary statistics suggest. The Central Statistical Office has made a
brave experiment in publishing an estimate of first-quarter gross domestic
product, suggesting that output (excluding oil) has been rising at an annual
rate of just over 2 1/2 per cent; but the estimate may well be raised.
Is the recovery too rapid for comfort? No one can say. We do not know the
trend rate of growth - most estimates are in the 2 per cent to 3 per cent a
year range. Above all we do not know how large is the 'output gap' due to
recession. If it is large, output could grow for some time at above trend
rate without disaster.
For such reasons the wisest economists have embraced a financial framework
designed to encourage non-inflationary growth without attempting to
fine-tune the real economy.
It is in this financial framework that policy problems are liable to arise.
The dip in sterling at the beginning of this week was a reflex to reaction
on the foreign exchange market in the face of the Byzantine intrigues of the
anti-Maastricht factions. The trend of sterling for much of 1993 could well
be upwards.
The severity of the recession in Germany and the alarmist reaction of the
establishment there is likely to accelerate the pace of interest rate cuts.
More and more analyses are appearing which suggest that the D-Mark is
overvalued. This view could come to affect foreign exchange market sentiment
 -both directly and by its effect on German economic policy.
One can easily imagine a repeat of the 1987-88 dilemma. This was whether to
cut interest rates or to allow sterling to rise to levels which could be
both unsustainable and damp the recovery.
Already the finance director of an engineering company has told the
Financial Times that if the government allows the pound to strengthen any
further 'then it must be out of its tiny mind'. If sterling were indeed to
strengthen later in the year there would be enormous pressure to cut base
rates to cheapen the pound.
Unfortunately, the self-interested business pressure for a low pound is
given added respectability by the concern of mainstream economic analysts
about the current payments deficit. For instance, Gavyn Davies of Goldman
Sachs (and a member of the chancellor's forecasting panel) believes that a
10 per cent fall in sterling's real exchange rate may be required if output
is to grow at anything like its trend rate.
Yet Davies is also sympathetic to the Treasury's desire for a strong pound
to prevent the official 4 per cent inflation ceiling (excluding mortgage
interest payments) from being breached. He tries to reconcile objectives by
outlining an optimal path under which sterling would be kept at about its
present level for the time being - to avoid an inflation blip to 5-6 per
cent - and then further depreciation encouraged later.
I would label this policy anti-Augustinian. The famous saint prayed to be
made virtuous but not yet: the strategy followed by Norman Lamont with his
deferred tax increases. The Goldman Sachs exchange rate advice is just the
opposite: make me profligate but not yet. Mention of saints is highly
appropriate, as Davies admits that it would take a miracle to produce the
right timing.
The strategy would, in any case, be wrong-headed. It is an example of the
incurable habit of mainstream economists to suppose that the Treasury can
fix real magnitudes such as competitiveness or the current trade balance for
more than a transitory period.
Davies's own diagram is revealing. It shows that competitiveness since 1979
has been 18 per cent less favourable than in the 1960s and 1970s (UK Weekly
Comment, April 23). But even in the later period sterling has more often
than not been below the level indicated by estimates of its purchasing power
in terms of traded products.
The degree of undervaluation required in the 1970s when the UK was a large
net oil importer and beset by quality and delivery problems has limited
bearing on what is required today. Competitiveness is mainly influenced by
structural forces such as oil and capital movements which determine the
needed manufacturing balance. Attempted changes for policy purposes end up
with unwanted inflation or deflation.
My own advice would be to encourage sterling to edge upwards, even if this
means putting off the prospect of further base rate cuts. But that does not
mean that the sky should be the limit. There would be no point in having
endured the agonies of sterling's departure from the exchange rate mechanism
last September only to let the pound approach the old DM2.778 lower limit.
(Any ERM re-entry will have to be freshly negotiated).
As the Bundesbank realised in its earlier campaign for D-Mark revaluation,
the movement and level of the exchange rate are indicators of policy
tightness just as much as domestic interest rates. But because of the
traumas endured when the government shadowed the D-Mark in 1987-88, I fear
that the Treasury could act in caricature of what the engineering company's
finance director fears and allow sterling to rise too high, only to follow
the anti-Augustinian depreciation advice later on. Even outside the ERM an
explicit policy for sterling is needed - which does not mean precise floors
or ceilings at which speculators can aim.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Letter: Africa needs new economic medicine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEWART WALLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your comment on our Africa: Make or Break report ('Diagnosing Africa's
ills', April 29), is right to point to the past and present policy failures
of some African governments. Misguided economic policies, autocracy, endemic
corruption and armed conflict have been part of the lethal cocktail which
threatens to consign the region's citizens to deepening poverty.
This is why northern governments should encourage the moves towards
democratisation, peace and economic policy realism now taking place in many
African countries with a 'Marshall plan' for recovery.
Seven years after the Group of Seven industrial countries grudgingly
accepted the need for debt relief, the world's poorest region is being
drained of Dollars 10bn annually.
There can be no moral or economic justification for this, especially in the
wake of the massive debt relief measures agreed for Russia. This is why
Oxfam is calling on Britain to press for a new initiative on African debt at
the G7 summit in July.
Structural adjustment programmes (SAPs), implemented by African governments
under the tutelage of the World Bank and the IMF, have failed to create a
platform for economic recovery and even more conspicuously to address the
challenge of poverty alleviation. The World Bank's own most recent review
confirmed that SAPs have a particularly bad record in terms of restoring
investment, the yardstick against which recovery prospects must be measured.
In part, this can be traced to the impact of deflationary monetary policies
and sweeping trade liberalisation measures under SAPs. These have exposed
fragile, but potentially competitive, manufacturing industries to increased
competition in the face of spiralling interest rates and rising import
costs. The predictable result has been disinvestment, de-industrialisation
and mounting unemployment.
Rather than apportion blame between doctor and patient, surely it is time to
recognise that both are hooked on the wrong medicine. It is time for the
World Bank and IMF to surrender their dogmatic attachment to an outmoded set
of economic prescriptions. What is needed is a new approach to adjustment,
based on redistribution policies, selective import liberalisation, more
carefully phased market reforms and above all a commitment to increased
investment in human capital.

<TEXT>
REINVENTING GOVERNMENT By David Osborne and Ted Gaebler Addison-Wesley
Pounds 19.95/Dollars 22.95, 405 pages
The publishing world has long recognised that books by business management
gurus such as Tom Peters and Peter Drucker can be big money-spinners. The
same has not been true about books on public-sector management, until the
arrival of Reinventing Government.
When the book was first published in the US last year, it shot into The New
York Times non-fiction best-seller list for eight weeks. In its ninth
reprinting, it is now being promoted to receptive audiences around the
world.
The authors were barely known in the US until the book's publication. Ted
Gaebler is a management consultant who was formerly city manager of Visalia,
California, and Vandalia, Ohio. David Osborne is a writer, journalist and
political consultant.
The success of the book means that they now command superstar fees for
speaking at conferences and advising politicians. This week, top British
civil servants and local government managers will hear Mr Osborne in a
programme of seminars organised by the Civil Service College.
The book's message is simple - there is a revolution under way in
government, as people demand more from public services while being prepared
to pay less in taxes. Getting more for less is creating an entrepreneurial
spirit, the authors say, which is transforming the public sector 'from
schoolhouse to state-house, city hall to the Pentagon'.
The traditional model for delivering public services is the top-down
bureaucracy designed to ensure equity of treatment for the taxpayer by
delivering identical services to all. But consumers are no longer happy with
standardised public services. Quality, choice, responsiveness and
competition are what the punters have become accustomed to in the private
sector. They now want the same in the public sector - and want it for less.
That requires public-sector managers to behave more like entrepreneurs,
defined by the French economist Jean-Baptiste Say as shifting 'economic
resources out of an area of lower and into an area of higher productivity
and greater yield'.
The authors set out 10 principles around which entrepreneurial government
can be established. These include old favourites from mainstream business
management literature, such as decentralisation, meeting the needs of
customers and becoming mission-driven.
But there are also more fundamental points which justify the title of the
book. For example, public funds should be used to encourage the private
sector to provide services, rather than to create new public agencies and
organisations. Success should be measured in terms of outcomes, whether it
be educational qualifications or successful operations, rather than budget
size or staff numbers. Public services should invest in prevention rather
than cure.
Above all, the role of government is to steer, not to row. This is the core
of the 'reinventing government' approach, a new vision of public services in
which the state sees its job as enabler rather than doer, purchaser rather
than provider.
Along with most 'how to manage' books, this volume is stuffed with success
stories which illustrate the new entrepreneurialism, almost entirely drawn
from US experience. It also has its heroes such as General Bill Creech, who
reorganised the Defence Department's Tactical Air Command along
decentralised lines and revolutionised its performance.
Only passing references are made to public-sector reforms in other countries
such as the UK, New Zealand and Australia. This is a pity, since New
Zealand, in particular, best embodies the spirit of reinventing government,
with all public services now provided under contracts which clearly specify
outcomes. Such omissions irritate UK admirers of the book, including Mr
William Waldegrave, the public services minister. He points out that the
government published its Citizen's Charter, commended by Osborne and
Gaebler, on the very day that the two authors submitted their manuscript to
the publishers.
However, it is the theoretical underpinning of the public service reforms
now under way across many of the advanced economies which accounts for the
book's deserved success. It provides a rationale for the practices which
public-sector managers in a variety of countries have adopted in the search
to get more for less from public funds.
The success of the book also marks what is described as a paradigm shift in
thinking. In the 1980s, it was the Reagan-Thatcher agenda which dominated
problem-solving in government. This sought to force back the boundaries of
the state, privatising some public services and withdrawing altogether from
others.
A new agenda has emerged in the 1990s, which is more concerned with making
public services efficient and effective than in cutting them down to size.
It is also an agenda which finds support across the ideological spectrum.
In the US, it is the Democrats who have taken up the cause, in contrast to
the Bush administration which, with honourable exceptions, neglected such
domestic issues. It is natural territory for Bill Clinton, who spent time
reinventing the Arkansas state government during his governorship. In
Australia and New Zealand, it was Labor administrations which launched
public-sector reforms. In the UK it has been the Conservatives under John
Major who have seized the 'reinventing government' agenda, a clear break
with the Thatcherism which preceded it.
Whatever the political stripe of the politicians, they are all responding to
the same demand for better-quality public services at less cost. For the
ambitious public-sector manager, Osborne and Gaebler are now required
reading.

Sir, Unfortunately it is necessary to correct your report on the legal issue
of the collective bargaining contract in the metal and electronics industry
and the steel industry of the new federal lands of Germany ('Morale suffers
in the old east', April 30).
Part of the contract is a revision clause and in addition to this is an
arbitration clause. In both industries the two possibilities of revision and
arbitration had been put into action, but without any success for the
employers' case.
The independent chairpersons of the arbitration committee (ie not
arbitration tribunals) decided, in each case, in favour of the trade union
IG Metall. The employers' association was not able to prove facts and
figures in order to claim that the agreed pay rise - starting on April 1
1993 - would ruin companies.
It is a completely different issue to rescind unilaterally a collective
bargaining contract by the employers. There is no clause in this contract
allowing one side to do so.
This way of dealing with an agreed contract a year before the first
possibility to withdraw must be considered as a danger to the German law of
contract according to our civil law code.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Letter: UK must retaliate on California tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir MICHAEL GRYLLS, MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, George Graham in his article 'UK defiant over California tax' (April
29) said that 'Britain and the US are heading towards confrontation' over
California's use of worldwide unitary tax. The US administration should be
under no illusion over the strength of feeling on this issue in the UK.
Some 214 members of parliament, from all parties, have signed a Commons
motion calling for the government to retaliate. At the Unitary Tax
Campaign's co-ordinating committee meeting on April 27, the members voted
unanimously to retaliate.
At the meeting of the CBI's 'American Club' on April 29, there was an
overwhelming vote to retaliate immediately (25-30 in favour, four against
with a few abstentions).
Too many Americans have given too many assurances over too many years. Our
patience has run out. America understands only one language, that of tough
negotiation as demonstrated again in their dealings with the Japanese. The
British government should no longer be prepared to be fobbed off with
promises for future action which, from past experience, come to nothing. The
government should now retaliate immediately to get this issue resolved once
and for all.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Arts: Brecht crossed with party-line China - Cinema
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE STORY OF QIU JU (12) Zhang Yimou
GROUNDHOG DAY (PG) Harold Ramis
TRESPASS (18) Walter Hill
AN ACTOR'S REVENGE (PG) Kon Ichikawa
The shadow of Tiananmen Square spreads across the remote village in Zhang
Yimou's The Story Of Qiu Ju. A year or more ago China's greatest film-maker,
having won friends abroad and foes at home with his no-mercy masterpieces
Red Sorghum and Raise The Red Lantern (both banned in China), found himself
backed into a political cul-de-sac. In the wake of the Beijing massacre and
the country's return to hard-line Maoism he was given, effectively, a simple
choice. Either make a film the authorities like or . . .
'Or' in China can mean many things: 'Goodbye, movie career,' 'Here is your
ticket to another canton', 'Please fall under this tank.' So Zhang Yimou
made a film that obeyed the rules. Qiu Ju unfolds at times like a Brecht
morality drama crossed with a party-line Chinese film from the bad old days:
the kind that waved titles like 'Suki Loo Beats the Black Marketeers' or
'Red Women Raise The Flag Over The New Sewage System'.
But a great film-maker is incapable of turning out a worthless movie. The
Story Of Qiu Ju has a vigour and crackpot humanity even amid its
prescriptive Peking populism. The heroine is a pregnant peasant woman (Gong
Li) whose husband has been kicked where it hurts during a row with the
village headman. She must - she will - have justice. So off she troops to
the local policeman, then to the local town, then to the local capital . . .
Not for this chilli-growing Mother Courage the partial victory of a pay-off
to her spouse or reprimand to the headman. She wants justice plus an
apology. Each time that justice falls short, she throws her well-earned
money from the pepper market at the next legal mountain to be climbed.
When she reaches the provincial capital she is as bruised and dazed by her
own fortitude as by the unfamiliar city life around them. Zhang Yimou's
hidden camera captures the alien madness. Bicycle-taxis clattering; sea of
voices nattering; cartfuls of furniture going surreally by (note the woman
sitting on a sofa astride a rickshaw) as if Chinese life en masse were
rebelling against its political embalment with a daft, fervent parody of the
nomadic.
Directed by anyone else, this fable of uplift and upward legal mobility
might have been unbearable. Some details, like the heroine's pregnancy, are
unbearable. In addition to her other symbolic burdens Qiu Ju must waddle
across China carrying the country's future inside her? And the baby's birth
sets off the final series of resistible plot detonations: cross-country dash
to hospital, husband's crisis of marital faith, the swing into a smiling
coda with the headman forgiven, albeit too late for the snapping of
justice's Damoclean sword.
But before this Zhang Yimou salvages what he can - and it is more than
enough - by the simple device of changing his style. No soaring Jacobean
grandeur here, no savage poetry of colour and camerawork. Instead Qiu Ju
bundles as many faces as it can into the frame - using depth as in a 3D
movie - and deploys its multiplicity of human detail like chaff to baffle an
Exocet. The deadly Maoist Messages keep swerving off course, confused by the
sparkling flakes of comedy, character detail and wittily, winningly observed
social flux.
Bills sent to the wrong address are the subject of the week's two Hollywood
films. The first Bill (funnyman Murray) is a Philadelphia TV weatherman
posted to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. For the citified cynic-hero of
Groundhog Day the supposed one-day outside-broadcast mission becomes,
literally, a small eternity. The second Bill (Paxton in the thriller
Trespass) does the town mouse/country mouse routine in reverse. An Arkansas
fireman, he is lured to St Louis by one of the few things that could lure
anyone to St Louis: a priceless trove of gold. It is stashed, he and
flame-fighting friend William Sadler learn from an improbably obtained
treasure-map, in a derelict factory.
Now: think hard for a moment. What always happens when bills go astray?
Exactly. Someone else pays for your mistakes or you for theirs; or else
justice is done after long litigation. Groundhog Day is a mixture, but a
delicious one, of all three. In this bubbling comedy co-written and directed
by Harold Ramis (Ghostbusters, Caddyshack), Bill Murray wakes up on a dozen
identical mornings in a town he has only checked into for one night - his
italics - to report on the annual ceremony of the groundhog. (Toothy
creature emerges from hibernation; sights shadow; heralds spring.)
Each dawn the same radio-alarm assaults his ears with country music. The
same boarding-house lady supervises breakfast. (Murray: 'Do you have deja
vu?' She: 'I'll check with the kitchen'). And the same pretty TV producer
Andie McDowell tells him he is late after he has sloshed through melted snow
and has almost sloshed, en route, the town's overfriendly insurance
salesman.
But days in a bucolic time-warp have an advantage. Like reincarnation, they
allow a Buddhist self-perfecting process. First our hero becomes nasty: note
the crumpled-sheets face, frazzled eyes and cracked-voice wisecracks.
(Murray on this form is the most voluptuous misanthropist since WC Fields.)
Then he becomes crafty, using each new day as homework for the next. The
fancied McDowell once studied 19th century French poetry? 'What a waste of
time' croaks Murray on day one; next day he comes in right on cue with
complete stanzas of Baudelaire. He can also, of course, survive death,
injury and overeating.
Finally, though - enter the ghost of Frank Capra - our hero becomes plain
nice. In last reel the movie spirals up into an implausible, inevitable
Hollywood ether of true love, rescued groundhogs, uplifted townspeople,
spring weather. But even here happiness comes too late to spoil the fun. The
bills have all been paid or reclaimed: Murray's to society, misanthropy's
from its proper targets (insurance-men, C-and-W music), the Hollywood humour
department to us the paying customer. And we feel we have earned the right
to keep chuckling through the sanctimonious finale.
City people being thrown into the sticks, where they learn a homely
humanity, is a well-established movie trope. (See a dozen recent movies from
Witness to Doc Hollywood.) In Trespass the trope is mirror-written. Two
gold-seeking rural firemen are thrown from Nowhere, Arkansas, into a
designer urban slumland. Art director Jon Hutman makes the broken-down St
Louis factory a merry hell of rusting girders, dangling cables, splintered
windows. Ridley Scott's Blade Runner meets Walter Hill's Streets Of Fire;
and since Mr Hill is the director of Trespass we are soon into one of those
apocalyptic closed-space guerrilla wars he makes his own.
The two white heroes, panning for the Greek art treasures rumouredly hidden
under a floorboard after a theft 15 years before, are cornered by a band of
black thugs led by dandyish Ice T. Since Ice T is conducting his own civil
war with would-be leader Ice Cube - put an ice-pack to your brain and bear
with the mantric cast list - guns and knives and screams and torchings are
soon the order of the day. Or the week, or the year: depending on how long
the 100-minute running time seems to you.
To me it seemed as long as Bill Murray's awayday in Punxsutawney seemed to
him. The far-fetched buried treasure plot - original script by Robert
Zemeckis and Bob Gale of Back To The Future - is a made-in-hell match with
Walter Hill's reductive stichomythia of gunfire, explosions, F-words and
drug-culture melodrama. (When in doubt, stab someone with a hypodermic or
crucify a gibbering heroin victim against a door). And the more artful the
images become in this Sensationalist's Guide to America after the LA riots -
its original US title was Looters - the more ridiculous seems their
harnessing to a plot that would have earned C minus in a beginners'
screenwriting class.
Make up for time wasted in St Louis by two hours in another, better inferno.
Kon Ichikawa's An Actor's Revenge, revived at the ICA, has all Hill's blaze
of imagery but a blazingly believable plot - revenge and murder among Kabuki
theatre people - to go with it.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Arts: Balanchine's 'Ballet Imperial'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The history of Balanchine's Ballet Imperial at Covent Garden has been
curious, lamentable. The ballet was made in 1941 for a show-the-flag tour of
South America by Balanchine's erstwhile company; the choreographer's
realisation of Tchaikovsky's second piano concerto was an abstraction of the
emotional and technical world of the Petipa repertory, and also of the
courtly society that sustained it.
When New York City Ballet was preparing to make its first London visit in
1950, Balanchine was invited to mount a piece for the Royal Ballet, and
Ballet Imperial was staged with designs by Eugene Berman. The design, like
the ballet, was a marvel, and our dancers soon took the measure of the
choreography and its bravura style. Fonteyn, the first cast ballerina, was
not happy in the role; her successor, Moira Shearer, gave a glittering,
splendid interpretation. Among later ballerinas, Nadia Nerina and Antoinette
Sibley were especially fine, rejoicing in the classic exactness of the part
and in its evocative richness. Ballet Imperial was a jewel in the repertory.
It was, inexplicably, given new - and very blue - design in 1963 by Carl
Toms. A decade later, as Balanchine revised the piece for his own company,
it was further democratised here by Terence Emery's design, which set the
piece in an urban underpass with dismal outfits for the performers, who did
not look their best. Ballet Imperial was now Piano Concerto Number 2, and
much of its identity was eroded. Worse was to come in 1985 with a wholly
inapt re-designing by Christopher Lebrun (the piece now located in a
wasteland), compounded by ferociously inadequate performance. Balanchine was
betrayed.
With this season's revival we have something like an amende honorable. The
Berman designs have been restored - albeit 'realised' by Anthony Dowell -
and the piece has been re-staged by Patricia Neary. There must be at least
two and a half cheers for the return of Berman's concept. The stage looks
magnificent, and Berman's fantasy of pillars and flambeaux and crowned
eagle, between great swags of gold drapery, is a triumph of stage
decoration. Dowell has lightened the image through use of gauzes - the
pillars are more vaporous than heretofore - but he respects the emotional
world that Berman established in such harmony with the choreography. The
costumes are in the main well realised, though some colours and details are,
I think, slightly 'off'. The leading ballerina should wear a brighter,
clearer yellow; the decoration on the second ballerina's bodice is missing
and must be restored, since it reflects Berman's visual theme.
A more serious matter is the text proposed by Miss Neary. She has given the
Royal Ballet the version now current in New York. The choreography as
mounted in London in 1950 was, if memory serves, more varied in detail, and
more suited to the idea of dancers wearing tutus. Shearer, Nerina, Sibley,
were pur-sang classical artists who cut Balanchine's steps like diamonds,
and showed these gems with imperious dignity and grace. The later text
(Balanchine's revision for his own troupe) implied speed and a more
democratic image - the women wore chiffon dresses - and it runs counter to
the courtly world of Berman's decoration. Vastly welcome as this Ballet
Imperial is, it is not quite at ease with itself.
Matters may be helped with more idiomatic performances than those from the
first cast. Viviana Durante skims through every difficulty with enviable
ease, but the scale of her dancing is too small: grandeur is lacking. The
ballerina's consort was first taken by Michael Somes. Nobility, romantic
presence, were his, and he made the ravishing middle movement seem like a
vision scene from some long-lost Petipa work. No-one since has given the
part such poetry. In this revival Bruce Sansom is extinguished both by the
role and by his costume. Darcey Bussell is happy as the second ballerina -
if not always as bright in step as she might be - and her two cavaliers are
pleasing. The ensemble is clear, well-mannered: if I have a wish for this
important restoration, it is that experience will enable the cast to show
these superlative dances with bolder attack, greater feeling for their grand
shape. Like St Petersburg itself, the choreography is ideal in proportion,
gleaming with light.
This latest Covent Garden triple bill brings a powerful revival of
MacMillan's Gloria, done with tangible dedication by its cast - Leanne
Benjamin, Christopher Saunders, Adam Cooper, Nicola Roberts. The images of
grief and despair - and compassionate love - which inspire these revenants
touch the heart. It is a beautiful ballet, given with absolute integrity.
The programme also includes David Bintley's 'Still Life' at the Penguin
Cafe, which I do not understand at all. The audience reacts with delight to
dancers impersonating animals (yet again]). I think we should encourage
poachers.
This programme repeats on May 6, May 20, May 26

Not all Japanese eat whalemeat. In Whale Wars (BBC 2, 9.35), Japanese
conservationists express their opposition ahead of next week's meeting of
the International Whaling Commission. It also emerges that the waters have
been muddied by the whaling industry's effort to convince the Japanese that
the western campaign against whaling is an assault on their cultural
identity.
A thousand brains must have considered the idea of a TV pastiche of Radio
4's eternal Desert Island Discs, only to reject it. Now someone has come up
with Memento (C4, 8.00), a misconceived, feeble series. However, anyone who
cannot have enough of the creamy timbre of Dame Kiri Te Kanawa's voice can
enjoy her performance tonight, enthusing about her eight most prized
possessions. There is a lot wrong with the British legal system, yet it is
still all to the good that TV cameras are held at bay while cases are
decided. They do it differently in Luxembourg, which made possible tonight's
episode of True Stories: Lovers on Trial (C4, 9.35), a gory murder story
worthy of Zola.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Arts: Berio's 'Epiphanies' - Music in New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several out-of-town orchestras have brought new pieces to Carnegie Hall this
spring: the San Francisco Symphony were here with John Harbison's Oboe
Concerto just before their European tour, and the Baltimore Symphony brought
George Perle's Adagio, a Carnegie commission. The Philadelphia Orchestra's
contribution last week to this parade was a work both old and new, Luciano
Berio's Epiphanies, which he promises is the final version of his Epifanie,
begun in the 1950s.
Epifanie always was a mutable score: a set of a dozen orchestral songs and
interludes that could, in the fashion of the time, be put together in
different ways to create different trajectories through the wide sky of
musical voicing, from song to speech or vice versa, with visits to rhapsodic
lyricism and stringent declamation. Epiphanies freezes the action. Now there
is only one permitted ordering, which is, with one minor switch, the
arrangement Berio had always preferred, taking the soloist from Proust's
hesitant reverie to Brecht's bitter disillusionment, with Joyce's vision of
a girl on the Liffey strand as the ecstatic centrepiece.
Berio's elimination of the work's mobility seems to have had an essentially
practical intent, like his reduction of its orchestral extravagance (there
are now four trombones, not seven). But he has taken the opportunity of the
single course to introduce links between what were previously isolated
movements - most conspicuously a discreet reference to the 'Miserere' from
Il Trovatore shortly before the Joyce day-dream, giving the impression of a
distant orchestral murmuring that something important is about to arrive.
Other differences between the 1991 and 1965 versions will no doubt emerge
more clearly when the two scores are available for study. The impression
from a first hearing of Epiphanies is that the orchestra now, besides being
more compact, is more effective in conveying the impression of speaker-less
speech, of vowels and consonants, coughs and grunts and shrieks rolling
round the platform, right from the beginning, where the ensemble begins to
find its voice in soft drum rolls and tremolos on flute and violins.
However, this strikingly positive sensation may have been produced simply by
the expert beauty and address of the playing.
As for the singing, one big problem is that the work was written for the
voice and the personality of Cathy Berberian, and it still sounds that way
even in this posthumous revision. Charlotte Hellekant sang her part from
memory, and with a fetching richness of tone in the contralto register, but
Berberian's exhilaration was missing. It was also a mistake of theatre, in
what is incipiently a theatrical piece, for her to sit down between items:
the soloist ought to be poised and waiting to take her next opportunity to
fly or swim or march with the orchestra, or to be drowned in the clamour.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Arts: Kafka's 'The Trial' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This version of Kafka's classic novel is like a limp handshake. It doesn't
grasp the novel, and it doesn't grip us. It whooshes its protagonist, K,
through all the bewildering, bizarre and frustrating preliminaries of a
trial whose purpose and nature neither he nor we ever understand, it speeds
him along a gallery of unsettling characters  - but it is all just a grey
precis.
A pity, since it has much going for it. This adaptation was first made by
Jan Grossman, the celebrated Czech director who died this February, in 1966.
Its director here, Lida Engelova (also Czech), staged his version of The
Trial in St Petersburg in (of all times) spring 1989. The present staging -
which marks her British directorial debut - is fluent, imaginative,
succinct; and it contains plenty of good acting. So why does it not enthral?
Part of the problem is James Wilby as K. This actor has developed an
interesting line in characters who are weak but intense, but his way of
communicating intensity, with over-emphatic facial expressions and
over-calculated gestures, fails to convince. And everything about him - the
lazily clear vowels, the lordly and relaxed use of his hands, even the
frequently puzzled look about the eyes - carries so hefty a whiff of the
English class system that he cannot penetrate to the heart of Kafka's
Mittel-Europa totalitarian state.
But another part of the problem is that Engelova and Grossman do not catch
the dark irony of Kafka's prose. Not at the Young Vic, at any rate. Oh, they
are certainly aware of all the metaphysical, political, judicial and sexual
aspects of K's story. But the deadly appearance of impassive detachment with
which Kafka makes his every stroke all the more meaningful is missing. The
mystery of the unseen 'They' never has terror for us here, and the anonymity
of reducing the protagonist's name to a mere initial is lost.
Kafka is most alive amid the roster of supporting roles, several of them
halfway into Dickensian caricature. Peter Eyre is wonderfully lugubrious as
the Advocate in Part Two, droning dolorously about the capriciousness of
clerks, and the crucial importance of 'the highest grade of the lower
orders'. Even in the small role of the Examining Magistrate in Part One, he
has a deadpan solemnity that is utterly Kafkaesque. Estelle Kohler, as
Lenka, is a slyly lascivious cat; Simon Dutton's painter Titorelli is an
entirely plausible con-artist of the wheels of bureaucracy; and Jake
Nightingale and David Barber make the two warders into bitterly funny and
horrid portraits of petty crookedness. Guy Manning's priest, however, does
not bring off his long tale.
At the Young Vic, until May 22; sponsored by Lovell White Durant, an award
winner under the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme

FT  06 MAY 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A blunder on a
corporate scale - Hoover has joined the infamous group of companies which
have made large public relations errors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It looks as though Hoover's free flights offer will join that select, but
infamous list of blunders which brought leading brand names low. Firestone
Tire and Rubber, AH Robins (maker of the Dalkon Shield contraceptive) and
Perrier are among companies which suffered similar blows. But judging by its
performance so far, Hoover appears to have learnt little from other
companies on how to mend its reputation.
In the memorable words of Leonard Hadley, chairman of Maytag (Hoover's US
parent), the UK company's 'free flights' promotion was like a 'bad accident
and you can't determine what was in the driver's mind'. In 1992 Hoover
offered any UK customer who spent a minimum of Pounds 100 on its products,
the chance of two free flights to either Europe or the US.
The response was like a tidal wave. The media have since been full of
stories of irate customers who paid their money, filled in the application
form and have still heard nothing from Hoover or its contracted travel
agencies, in many cases months after making their initial purchase.
At the end of April Maytag announced a net loss of Dollars 10.5m (Pounds 7m)
in the first quarter of 1993, after taking a Dollars 30m special charge to
cover the unexpected cost of the promotion. Hoover's European president and
two senior executives were also dismissed over the controversial offer.
The saga, which still has some way to run since those hoping to fly to the
US will be able to take up their flights until April next year, is
reminiscent of other damage limitation exercises. Take Firestone's decision
to recall 10m of its 500 series radial tyres in October 1978. This came
after pressure from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
which acted only after receiving 14,000 consumer complaints, including at
least 29 fatal traffic accidents and hundreds of property damage accidents
involving cars using the Firestone 500.
Throughout the messy episode the company continued to deny, against public
anxiety, that there was anything wrong with the product. The US government
did not order the recall, but Firestone was perceived to drag its feet.
Analysts estimated then that bad publicity cost Firestone 3 per cent of its
25 per cent share of the multi-billion US tyre market.
AH Robins also made mistakes. By 1973 independent researchers were linking
its Dalkon Shield with a variety of medical problems, including fatalities.
Consumer complaints were gathering force, but Robins criticised complainants
rather than asking itself if the product was at fault. The US Food and Drug
Administration asked Robins to stop marketing it until tests were completed.
By the time it was cleared in December 1974 Robins was facing a welter of
individual legal actions. By September 1980 the company sent a letter to
200,000 doctors saying the IUD should be removed. By then, the damage to the
company's image was irreparable. On February 29 1984 three top executives
from Robins were rebuked by a federal judge in Minneapolis. Instead of
accepting the judge's remarks, the Robins executives took legal action
against the judge; and lost.
That same year Robins took an extraordinary charge of Dollars 615m against
outstanding claims and later filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Eventually the
company was bought by American Home Products in 1988. In his book Marketing
Mistakes, Robert Hartley pinpoints one of Robins' basic problems. 'It was
entering a market in which it had no previous experience whatsoever. . .
(it) had not a single obstetrician or gynaecologist on its staff. . .it
rushed the product to market.'
Colin Gilligan, professor of marketing at Sheffield business school, is just
one critic of Hoover's recent reaction to crisis. 'One gets the impression
in the Hoover example that it has gone for immediate damage limitation
rather than taking a more strategic approach to it,' he says. 'When Perrier
recognised it faced a significant problem (traces of benzene found in its
bottled water in February 1990, resulting in a worldwide product recall) it
understood that you can't try to hide things from the public or the media,
because the key issues are going to emerge sooner or later.
'Hoover has not looked at the broader picture but has responded in almost
knee-jerk fashion.'
Most consultants agree there is one fundamental requirement to avoid a
corporate blunder affecting consumer perceptions turning into a public
relations disaster. According to Peter Cunard, partner of Tolman Cunard,
strategic communications advisers: 'The first rule in any crisis management
is be completely open, because if you are not it is going to come back and
hit you between the eyes.'
Hoover has taken some steps towards opening up by admitting there has been a
problem. And it has issued a rash of press releases promising that all those
who took up its free flights offer will eventually get on to an aircraft.
But Hoover refuses, on grounds of 'commercial sensitivity', to disclose the
precise number of people who applied for the offer.
Consumers participating in the offer - and shareholders for that matter -
surely want to know the number. If only 5,000 have applied, Dollars 30m
should easily cover the bill. But if 300,000 have applied, then is Dollars
100 per person really sufficient even now to get them all on board an
aircraft? From its responses to inquiries, Hoover still appears to believe
that withholding important information will not be damaging to consumer
confidence.
'It's a casebook which I am sure will be taught in communication skills
classes in years to come,' says Cunard. 'Hoover's first failing seems to me
that it did not appear to have a checklist which had on it 'what if
something goes wrong?' It's a standard formula for anybody linked to
marketing. Let's say there is another disaster and an aeroplane went down
loaded with Hoover passengers. What about that scenario? Is the onus then on
Hoover to do something for the relatives? The evidence so far is that that
checklist was not there. What they cannot calculate and I do not suppose
they ever will, is the damage to the Hoover name hereafter.'
What characterises successful companies in these circumstances, suggests
Gilligan, is management recognition that they have an image problem, that
they have to take decisive action and that secrecy is not going to pay off.
'Taking those points together, they then work out how they are going to
respond strategically, which in the case of Perrier was to take the brand
off the shelf completely, and keep the public informed via the media. Hoover
can't take the product off the shelf but the parallel is that its response
appears to have been characterised by a degree of indecision and a denial of
the magnitude of the problem it was facing.
'That has not been helped by comments from one or two people within Hoover,
that the consumer was being rather foolish in expecting to get something for
nothing,' Gilligan says.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Japan enters the
world of fantasy - Robert Thomson samples the delights of Tokyo Disneyland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Japanese cowboy politely cleared the way for Mickey Mouse and Scottish
dancers in their clan tartan practised steps for a 10th anniversary parade
around the meticulously clean, yen-paved streets of Tokyo Disneyland.
Euro Disneyland may be struggling to establish its identity, but Tokyo
Disneyland's success has prompted the Japanese managing company, Oriental
Land, to plan a marine-theme Disney park adjacent to the original.
The marketing of Disney in Japan was aimed at what Toshio Kagami, Oriental
Land's senior managing director, describes as a 'deep feeling for fantasy'
among Japanese, who were not culturally intimidated by the US-manufactured
icons and wanted undiluted Disney.
'Japanese have a good feeling for fantasy. When they come to Disneyland it
is like the Japanese tea ceremony. There are rules, roles and symbolism.
Japanese know that when they come here, they are in the US and they play
that role, that fantasy,' Kagami said.
Video game makers have tapped a similar desire for role-playing leisure.
Hayao Nakayama, the president of Sega, said that US and European software
buyers prefer quick-thrill competition scenarios, while games allowing
players to take on a new role are more popular in Japan.
'These games require more thought, more attention to detail. There are some
game maniacs in the US who like the role-playing type, but it's the common
thing in Japan,' Nakayama said.
For a culture stressing awareness of duties and in which the company name
comes before the family one, the desire to 'escape' from these roles into a
new identity or fantasy setting is understandable. But it is often important
that the fantasy role be as carefully signposted as that of the job
description.
Another theme park, the Huis Ten Bosch, is a recreation of what, in the
popular imagination, is a Dutch village, not far from Nagasaki. Instead of
Adventureland and Tomorrowland, the Dutch park has Utrecht, a restaurant
district, Kinderdijk, a pastoral setting with mandatory windmills, and
Spakenburg, a port town.
Holland Dutch Village Corporation, which runs the park, eventually hopes
10,000 people will submerge themselves in a new personality by living
permanently in the village. In the first year of operation to March, it
attracted 3.86m visitors and expects to profit from the government's aim to
increase leisure time and make Japan a 'lifestyle superpower'.
The Dutch village in Nagasaki will struggle to match the success of Tokyo
Disneyland. Expected to attract 10m visitors a year, the park had just over
16m in 1991, about 90 per cent of them repeat visitors. Oriental Land says
attendance was slightly lower last year for the first time since its
opening, a decline blamed on the souring of the economy.
'If you look at the falling profitability in other sectors, our 2 per cent
decline was pretty good. In some ways, it is a good thing, as we were over
our capacity and that affects the quality of people's fantasy experience,'
Kagami said.
There's a two-hour wait at the weekends for the most popular roller-coaster,
Splash Mountain, and queues of 40 minutes or more for the other
'white-knuckle' rides. And there's still a crush at the souvenir counters
for the Mickey ears and for plates embossed with the 'Sharing Disney Dreams
since 1983' slogan.
In the mid-1970s, when negotiations began between the Walt Disney Company
and Oriental Land, run by Mitsui Real Estate and Keisei Electric Railway,
both sides debated whether the park should be somehow made more Japanese
than the American original.
But Oriental Land says the Tokyo version is profitable precisely because it
did not attempt to link Goofy or Donald Duck to traditional Japanese
culture. One employee who experienced Euro Disney found it 'too European'
and another suggested the Japanese would be uneasy seeing traditional
screens on Cinderella's castle.
Disneyland's continuing success has encouraged non-entertainment companies
to diversify into theme parks. Nippon Steel has built Space World on the
southern island of Kyushu and there's a year-round indoor beach on another
old steel company site near Tokyo.
Sanrio, a gift and greeting card company, which built Puroland, about 40
minutes from Tokyo, is striving to create an instant, Disney-like tradition
and ethos around a cloyingly cute cat called Hello Kitty.
Sanrio claims that, at Puroland, customers 'learn to love' , 'exchange their
hearts' and are 'spiritually uplifted', none of which offers a Disney-like
escape. Perhaps that is why attendance fell 16 per cent to 1.5m last year.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Technology: Opportunities for teleworking
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Technology can bring little comfort to most of the 900 or more miners at
Grimethorpe colliery in South Yorkshire, which has ceased production of
coal.
But for a few, the local Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council's plans to
set up a remote office in the redundant National Coal Board offices in
Grimethorpe could provide a ray of hope. 'We're hoping to set up a workshop
community where local people are employed doing work which is outsourced
from other organisations,' says David Bramall, manager of the microsystems
centre, part of the council's economic development department. 'They will
work remotely for the parent organisation.'
Bramall hopes the centre will provide 20 jobs to begin with and will be in
full swing within a year. He believes many jobs - technical helplines, for
example - could provide worthwhile employment for local men. They could
handle calls from around the country while accessing data held on a database
sited remotely.
The problem the council faces is ensuring they can provide a service for
potential customers at a competitive market rate. The project has already
secured some EC funds under Mitre - market implementation of teleworking in
rural environments. 'Barnsley is semi-industrialised and quite remote,'
explains Bramall. 'The coalfields never needed good communications. All they
needed was a railway to get the coal away.'
But Bramall is still concerned that the cost of the equipment for remote
working could make services economically unviable. The cost of each
workstation, says Bramall, is about Pounds 2,000. There is the additional
cost of the phone lines needed to transmit voice and data calls
simultaneously using ISDN (integrated service digital network). Each line
costs Pounds 400 to install, plus the price of the calls.
Bramall is investigating ways of cutting costs. One potentially useful
communications technology is where users only pay for phone lines in use -
not for the 24 hours every day when they are available.
At the end of the day, says Bramall, 'what we want to do is try and lift
people's spirits a bit.'

FT  06 MAY 93 / People: Richard Ramsay to run Ivory and Sime's City office
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ivory and Sime, the Edinburgh-based fund management company, has appointed
Richard Ramsay, 41, as an executive director to run its newly expanded City
office and its private client business.
Ramsay has had a long association with Ivory and Sime in his former capacity
handling corporate finance clients at Hill Samuel and Co and, since 1988, at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
He was responsible for most of the company's investment trust flotations and
reconstructions and is a director of one of Ivory and Sime's investment
trusts. He also played a part in the privatisation of Scottish Power.
The former head of the company's private client business, David Nichol, 45,
who retired at the end of December to run a family farm in Scotland, was the
last of Ivory and Sime's 'old guard' following a well-publicised defection
of directors in 1990.
Alan Munro, managing director, says Ramsay's appointment is intended to help
raise the company's profile in the City of London: 'It's the first point of
contact for new private client and institutional client business'.

FT  06 MAY 93 / People: Lazard snaps up Knapton
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Knapton, the most recent in a long line of senior defections from
Invesco MIM, has joined Lazard Investors in the newly created position of
chief investment officer.
Knapton, 43, who had been managing director of Invesco's wholesale business
in the UK, has known Jimmy West, chief executive of the London-based fund
management group, since the late 1970s when West was running Globe
Investment Trust and Knapton Temple Bar Investment Trust. Both trusts were
part of the Electra group of funds.
Having joined Invesco two and a half years ago as head of UK equities 'to
sort out a particular problem the group had in that area', Knapton is
reluctant to talk about the reasons for his departure.
David Verey, chairman of Lazard Brothers, says the decision to create the
position at Lazard Investors, which manages around Pounds 4.5bn of
institutional and private client monies, was 'opportunity-driven'.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Technology: Banking on flexibility - Working from home has
several advantages, especially when disaster strikes the office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When a dumper truck of explosives shattered the 52 floors of London's
NatWest tower less than two weeks ago, 1,300 employees at the bank lost
their workplace. The impact was thought-provoking, to say the least, says
Duncan Peel, senior executive in the UK branch banking human resources
department. 'It makes you realise what you can actually do when you haven't
got a desk to sit at.'
For National Westminster, flexible working practices put in place throughout
the 1980s meant the bank was better able to deal with the problem, believes
Peel. These included staff working shorter hours and others working from
home.
Although the main thrust of NatWest's policy was to retain
expensively-trained and high-calibre staff, many big organisations are now
looking at working from home as a means of cutting overheads and even of
keeping the business going in the event of a headquarters' disaster, such as
a fire or a bomb.
As a result, working from home, which has traditionally been seen as
'slightly cranky, eccentric and craft-based,' according to Chris Moller,
managing director of the Cambridge-based consultancy Home Office
Partnership, has been added to the corporate agenda. Even the terminology
has shifted, from 'teleworking' to 'flexible working'.
He believes that in many cases the moves are a formalisation of the 'taking
work home in a briefcase scenario', which people have been doing informally
for years. Most people who work outside the traditional office environment
are skilled professionals who are used to working independently. And most
are men.
Peel believes flexible working can be introduced with as little technology
as the telephone. Others believe recent developments have made home-working
a much more appealing proposition.
'The confluence of technology has really made it viable,' says Richard
Nissen, managing director of Business Space, which provides business
services in central London. He points to three specific developments.
The first is laptop computers, especially notebooks which can be taken from
home to the office and plugged into 'docking stations'. Software which
enables remote users to phone the corporate database and download files, or
even alter data held at corporate headquarters, is widely available.
Second, fax modems are now available so that facsimile messages can be sent
from a notebook PC.
Third, advanced phone services - mobile phones, radio pagers, voice
mailboxes and call diversion facilities - have eased communications.
High-speed data lines - particularly the now near-ubiquitous ISDN
(integrated services digital network) services - mean that diverting a call
from one city to another can be as swift as diverting one across the office.
'The thing that has made most difference for us is computer-integrated
telephony,' says Neil Harris, of the Digital Equipment Corporation's
flexible working group. At Digital each employee has a single phone number
wherever he or she works. Once the employee logs on to the computer system -
at home or in the office - they send the number of the local phone to which
all calls are to be sent.
To a customer calling in to the company it is impossible to tell where the
recipient of the call is seated. 'It makes an enormous difference if people
calling don't know if you're in your office, in a satellite office or at
home,' points out Moller.
Business Space bundles a similar service with secretarial back-up for small
businesses from its London headquarters.
Companies quick to introduce flexible working practices have been those with
a knowledge of the technologies needed - such as Digital. It has become an
exemplary case of how a company can substantially cut its fixed overheads by
introducing teleworking.
Five per cent of Digital's UK workforce - 250 people - now work outside the
traditional office environment and the company hopes to extend this to 25
per cent over the next few years.
So far the company has reduced its property costs by about 30 per cent, says
Harris. Eventually Digital hopes to cut its building stock to just 10 per
cent of what it had a few years ago.
Harris believes that only by proper planning at the highest level within a
company will an organisation achieve higher productivity and reduce costs.
'If it's done properly you'll get a 'win-win' situation. Both the company
and individuals will benefit.'
At Mercury Communications the cost of accommodation, particularly in London,
has been the driving force behind new working practices. 'Over the last 18
months various disparate actions have happened. Now we're trying to tie them
all together,' says Chris Ridgewell, manager of the flexible working group.
In common with Harris, Ridgewell says that unless the programme has the
support of management at the highest level within the company 'it doesn't
happen properly, or goes off at half cock'.
Mercury is set to launch a three-year programme, initially targeting sales,
sales support and network support staff. Ridgewell believes that between 800
and 1,000 of Mercury's 9,000 staff, about one third of whom work in London,
will have some form of flexible working by September this year.
Flexible working patterns range from job-sharing to career breaks with work
carried out at home, in the company's satellite offices, or in local
business centres. These can be in hotels or business parks and companies can
rent facilities for employees on a full-time basis or as needs require.
From later this month, for example, the Deer Park Hotel in Honiton will be
opening a telecentre where individuals or company employees can rent office
space and equipment on an hourly or daily basis. The centre will be the
headquarters for the National Association of Teleworkers.
The procedure at Mercury will be for individuals to propose an arrangement
to their line manager who then looks at the costs. A cost case is then made
for the individual depending on the equipment they will need; the line
manager then decides on the basis of this whether the proposal should go
ahead.
Ridgewell says there will be 'several flavours' of the programme, because of
the different types of work done. But Mercury is hoping to formalise a list
of 'job types', to which costs for equipment needed will be attached.
In its introduction of flexible working Mercury is taking its own medicine.
Since October 1991 it has been advising its customers on introducing
flexible working through the use of telecommunications. Seventy large
companies are already converts, with some 27,000 full-time employees
involved in some kind of flexible working.
A typical scenario, says Ridgewell, would be where some 250 in a company -
one department, say - would be approached about flexible working and at the
end of the trial period about 80 people would be involved. After the first
year about half the staff are on the programme.
'The major problem is not the procedures, it's the managers' attitudes. They
think they're losing control,' says Ridgewell. 'It's very much a British
thing.'
In spite of that, Moller thinks changes in management attitude are the
biggest driver behind the new-found flexibility. He also argues that as
managements believe the recession is coming to an end they are now
re-considering how to retain their trained staff, an issue subsumed by
recession.
The management challenges are numerous: what sort of contracts people need,
how to make jobs task-orientated rather than time-orientated and ensuring
insurance and health and safety regulations are extended to the home.
'The key thing is to get the right balance between team dynamics and the
social content and the facilities for people to work independently,' adds
Harris. 'Most important is to get people involved in the way they work. It
all depends on good working practice and discipline and that sort of thing
doesn't happen by accident.'

FT  06 MAY 93 / Technology: Boost for epilepsy market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellcome, the UK drugs group, this week stressed the importance of its
epilepsy treatment, Lamictal, the first new medicine for the disease in 10
years.
The company believes it could significantly expand the Pounds 750m-a-year
epilepsy market, which, according to Lehman Brothers, the US brokers, is
growing at about 20 per cent a year.
Trevor Jones, research and development director, said the drug was a truly
outstanding advance in the treatment of epilepsy.
Trials suggested that more than half of patients adding Lamictal to their
existing medication experienced a 50 per cent reduction in seizures.
In 56 per cent of these patients, they were able to stop taking their
original anti-epileptic.
Jones said those suffering from an 'absence' effect associated with certain
types of epilepsy experienced a fall in momentary losses of concentration
when using Lamictal.
From a base-line of 140 incidents a month, events fell to less than 20. In
addition, the duration of events dropped from about 450 seconds to less than
50 seconds. The clinical trials also suggested the drug improved quality of
life and overall well-being.
Lamictal had a low incidence of central nervous systems side effects,
claimed Jones. The existing therapies such as Ciba-Geigy's Tegretol, Abbott
and Sanofi's Depakote and Epilim, and Warner-Lambert's Dilantin, have
problems with gastrointestinal side-effects.
Jones hoped the drug, presently licensed in 10 countries, would be approved
imminently in Germany, Italy, Spain and the US. In the UK, where it was
launched, it already has 13.5 per cent of the market.
Wellcome hopes to submit a new drug application for Lamictal to be used on
its own either next year or in 1995. A dossier for paediatric use should be
deposited over the next two years.
The company is also looking at using Lamictal and a more potent successor
compound called 524C79 for the treatment of acute and chronic pain.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Accountancy Column: Still too many variations for global
harmonisation / A look at at the continuing diversity of international
accounting and auditing practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NUMBERS MAY not have quite the same visual power as drawings, but a recently
published reference work is probably the nearest thing yet to the
accountants' equivalent of an atlas of the world.
The third edition of international accounting and auditing trends from the
US-based Centre for International Financial Analysis and Research (Cifar)
runs to 1,200 pages over two volumes in its portrayal of a widely varying
global pattern.
Perhaps the most impressive effort of the study is an exercise in re-stating
companies' accounts according to different standards to highlight this
variation.
German and Japanese figures, it says, tend to under-report earnings and book
values because of accelerated depreciation policies and unrestricted
provisions.
Recalculating the figures of several companies from each country according
to standards recommended by Cifar, German businesses' net income rises on
average by 44 per cent, book value by 41 per cent and the price/earnings
ratio falls 35 per cent.
For Japanese businesses, the corresponding figures are increases of 12 per
cent and 14 per cent, and a decline of 42 per cent respectively.
That pattern is borne out by the stated comparatives provided in a
relatively small number of accounts - most notably those publishing under US
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) alongside those of their own
country.
For example, SmithKline Beecham reports net income of Pounds 638m under UK
and Pounds 474m under US GAAP for 1991. The figures for shareholders' equity
are Pounds 743m and Pounds 4,113m respectively. Volvo reports net income of
(Kronor) SKr682m under Swedish and Skr816m under US GAAP, with shareholders'
equity of Skr33,864m and Skr29,494m respectively.
For an average of eight Japanese electronics companies which reported purely
under Japanese accounting standards, operating margins were 6.31 per cent
and price/earnings 41.42. For another comparable group which also provided
figures under US GAAP, the recast numbers were 9.03 per cent and 26.33.
But these analyses are not easy, partly because of questions over the
'neutral' standards by which the numbers are normalised, and partly because
the level of disclosure and treatment of figures in companies' accounts
varies tremendously between different countries.
Based on its databases and a collection of some 25,000 annual reports, Cifar
puts the spotlight on those which have seen the benefit of glasnost, and
those still with a rusting iron curtain firmly wrapped around them,
reluctant to let any treacherous numbers sneak into the public domain.
The form and content of annual reports varies widely around the world. The
most comprehensive and relevant data of industrial companies comes from
Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, New Zealand, Scandinavia (except
Denmark), South Africa, the UK and the US.
There was below-average disclosure in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany,
Italy, Japan, the Netherlands and Spain.
Cifar concludes that the main influence on disclosure is the pattern of
ownership and the scope of companies' operations - shareholders or
activities across borders.
In reviewing accounting standards, Cifar identifies wide variations. One of
the most inconsistently applied is depreciation, with the definition of the
'economic life' of an asset varying between five and 20 years. Variations in
the treatment of goodwill vary from reducing shareholders' equity, through
to amortisation over any period from 5 to 40 years.
Different standards make it difficult to examine other items in accounts
across borders, such as the cost of goods sold, expenses, fixed assets,
deferred income taxes and retained earnings. Failure to consolidate and the
use of multiple classes of shares also hinder comparisons.
Cifar also attempts to summarise the principal accounting and auditing
issues being considered by standards-setters. The Nigerians are looking at
accounting in the petroleum industry; the French at financial reporting for
political parties and groups; and the Germans at issues concerning the
integration of the former East Germany, considering the audit of opening
balance sheets of companies managed by the Treuhand, and accounting for
deferred taxes in former socialist housing corporations.
Yet again, there are few consistent patterns, suggesting little prospect of
harmonisation among accounting standards-setters and international
accounting standards. 'Every group is looking inwards and seems not ready
for any serious attempts at global harmonisation,' the report says.
One thing does remain almost constant around the world: the dominance of the
'Big 6' accounting firms. Their rankings may vary, but the shifts are among
the mega-firms rather than between them and others in the next tier. The
profession is also still highly concentrated. Partners in the UK, US and
Canada make up more than half of all partners and 34 per cent of all offices
around the world.
None the less, the survey suggests that three clusters are emerging among
these firms, with KPMG Peat Marwick and Ernst &amp; Young leading; Deloitte
Touche Tohmatsu and Coopers &amp; Lybrand in the next tier; and Arthur Andersen
and Price Waterhouse in the third.
Contrary to any suggestions that the dominance of the Big 6 has created an
oligopoly, the Cifar analysis argues that the audit market remains highly
competitive. Audit fees as a proportion of sales or assets have remained
virtually constant during the period 1987-91, stable at 0.022 per cent in
the UK and 0.026 per cent in Australia, for example. They do vary between
countries, going as low as 0.001 per cent in 1991 in Pakistan and as high as
0.045 in South Africa.
But Cifar is not complimentary about the standard of audit reports around
the world. The report reproduces a series of statements, which are often
unclear, make vague references to auditing standards and give little
indication of the work undertaken.
'There has been no improvement in auditors' reports,' says Mr Vinod Bavishi,
Cifar's editor in chief. 'I cannot figure out the bad from the good reports.
The accounting profession needs to get this under control.'

FT  06 MAY 93 / Drivers oppose road fee scheme

<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT faces severe public hostility to its plans to impose an extra
charge on motorists for the use of motorways, the results of an opinion poll
published today show.
The poll suggests that 86 per cent of motorists are opposed to the idea of
paying an extra charge.
Later this month the government is due to publish a green paper on its plans
for using motorway and trunk road charges as a means of funding its
road-building programme. The government seems likely to suggest that drivers
wishing to use motorways should be required to pay an annual supplementary
licence fee.
The poll of 1,079 motorists was carried out for the Royal Automobile Club by
Research Surveys of Great Britain in March.
It shows that 37 per cent of motorists say they will use motorways less
often if charges are introduced.

FT  06 MAY 93 / ECGD gave Matrix cover for Iraq deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXPORT Credit Guarantee Department agreed to provide cover for about
Pounds 6.5m of equipment destined for Baghdad which it suspected of being
used for military uses, the arms-for-Iraq inquiry heard yesterday.
The cover was provided in 1989 after the department thought it had been
given approval by other government departments.
Mr David Bryars, chief underwriter for the department's short-term credit
operations at the time, said concern about the equipment being exported by
Matrix Churchill, the Midlands-based machine-tool manufacturer, through
Industrias Cardoen of Chile, led him to contact the Foreign Office for
advice.
According to confidential Whitehall documents released during the trial of
three former Matrix Churchill directors last year, the exchange took place
in January 1989.
The department, which underwrites loans for export contracts, was then
government-owned. It has since been partly privatised.
Yesterday Mr Bryars, questioned by Miss Presiley Baxendale QC, counsel for
the investigation, said a Foreign Office official told him that Matrix
Churchill's goods were the subject of an investigation by the Foreign Office
and the Department of Trade and Industry, and that the matter of whether or
not the equipment should be licensed was with ministers.
'He said that his feeling was the decision would be that an export licence
would not be required . . . I was given a strong impression that it would be
OK,' Mr Bryars said. A similar impression, he added, was given by Customs
and Excise.
He was giving evidence on the second day of the public hearings conducted by
Lord Justice Scott into the extent to which the government may have colluded
in the export of defence sales to Iraq in breach of guidelines and
export-licensing arrangements. The inquiry continues on Monday.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Directors want company law changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANY LAW should be amended to reflect modern trends in corporate
governance, according to a Mori survey of senior directors published
yesterday.
More than four fifths would approve of amendments to require listed
companies to establish a remuneration committee to approve executives' pay,
wholly or mainly comprised of non-executives.
Three quarters would support a change in the law to oblige listed companies
to establish audit committees of non-executive directors responsible for
liaising with auditors.
The findings come in a poll of 200 chief executives and non-executive
directors commissioned by executive search companies Executive Interim
Management and Egon Zehnder International.
More than 90 per cent of non-executives and 87 per cent of chief executives
agreed that the law should be changed to require companies to disclose the
salary and performance-related emoluments of the chairman and highest-paid
director.
Nearly a third said no such remuneration committee existed in their own
company. Half did not have a non-executive audit committee with the proposed
powers.
Two thirds approved of the Cadbury report, which includes a code of best
practice to which companies will have to refer in annual reports from this
summer under Stock Exchange rules.
But two thirds disagreed with nominations committees with a majority of
non-executive directors to select future appointments.
Two thirds of non-executives said they were approached personally by the
chairman and a quarter already knew the chairman or chief executive.

FT  06 MAY 93 / IBM in health cash fiasco: Conflicts of interest blamed for
waste of Pounds 20m in computer project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MEMBER of Wessex Regional Health Authority, who was also a director of
International Business Machines, promoted his company's bid for an
information technology contract with the authority, the Commons public
accounts committee was told yesterday.
Mr John Bourn, comptroller and auditor-general, identified serious failings
in financial and management controls and conflicts of interest in fresh
reports on the mishandling of computerisation in Wessex region during the
1980s.
Mr Robert Sheldon, the committee's chairman, described the events set out in
the reports as a 'truly horrifying story'.
At least Pounds 43m was spent on computer projects and Mr Ken Jarrold, who
became general manager in 1990, yesterday told the committee that Pounds 20m
or more of this had been wasted. Mr Jarrold said it was 'very difficult
indeed to justify the events' and said a series of conflicts of interest had
been at the heart of them.
An Andersen Consulting/IBM consortium was a successful bidder for one of the
Wessex contracts. A member of the health authority who was a director of
corporate services at IBM had promoted the bid, says the report.
The report says the Andersen/IBM contract was approved at an inquorate
meeting of Wessex's information group.
Authority members were not formally informed that the contract had been
awarded until after it had been signed.
Wessex, says the report, employed Andersen Consulting as adviser to a
selection panel while the company was bidding for the main contract.
Andersen representatives attended several meetings at which the merits of
competitors' systems were discussed and, although officers of the authority
took exception to the apparent conflict of interest, no remedial action was
taken.
Mr Bourn's report says four people, including two former senior employees of
the region, face charges of conspiracy to defraud as a result of other
Wessex computer contracts.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Council patrol aims to cut crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NORTH-EAST local authority is setting up a street patrol to try to reduce
crime on housing estates. It is believed to be the first such patrol in
Britain to be run by a council.
The 'community force', approved this week by Sedgefield District Council's
policy and resources committee, will comprise 11 uniformed officials on
patrol.
Under the scheme, they will report by radio to a control depot which will
alert police to crime. The force will also consult residents on social
problems, liaise with police and other groups, call on vulnerable
householders and advise on crime prevention.
The service, expected to cost Pounds 220,000 in its first year and Pounds
180,000 a year thereafter, will be funded by the council. It has been
favourably received by Durham police.
But the Police Federation said the community force was a sad comment on
government underfunding of the police.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Job-creation ideas flow in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNDREDS of ways to reduce unemployment, including re-skilling up to 400
workers to decommission Soviet nuclear submarines, have been submitted to
the government by Training and Enterprise Councils.
Tecs, which administer state-funded training schemes for the jobless, were
invited by the government to compete for an extra Pounds 21m to run projects
to cut unemployment in the present financial year.
The deadline for appli-cations was yesterday. Tecs have taken a variety of
approaches. Birmingham Tec has looked for a closer working relationship
between itself and the Employment Service, which runs non-training options
such as Jobclubs. It wants to offer employers a single 'gateway' for
recruitment.
Aztec in south-west London proposes an allowance of up to Pounds 75 a week
to help jobless people with the transition from benefits to a work pattern
involving a number of part-time jobs. It also suggests training grants for
employers to support recruitment of thelong-term unemployed.
Cumbria Tec is submitting a project whereby former VSEL shipyard workers,
employed by a newly created marine technology transfer company, would be
trained to decommission Soviet submarines.
Ideas had to be new, they had to be capable of being set up by September and
of making a significant contribution to reducing unemployment. The
government expects to fund between 12 and 24 projects.
Many Tecs, while applying for the extra funding, have been critical of the
scheme, known as Tec Challenge. One critic said worthwhile schemes take more
than a few months to set up and 'Tecs are not interested in short-term
wheezes that are intended to massage the government's unemployment
register'.
The government yesterday placed more small companies outside the scope of
the industry training levy.
In future companies with combined payroll and payments to labour-only
sub-contractors of less than Pounds 61,000 a year will not be subject to the
levy. The previous ceiling was Pounds 45,000.

<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is considering a sale of
his department's five laboratories, which generate business worth more than
Pounds 100m a year.
In a Commons written reply he said the government was reviewing the future
of the National Physical Laboratory, the National Weights and Measures
Laboratory and the Laboratory of the Government Chemist, all at Teddington,
Middlesex; the National Engineering Laboratory in East Kilbride,
Strathclyde; and the Warren Spring Laboratory in Stevenage, Hertfordshire.
Mr Heseltine said that since becoming executive agencies three years ago,
the laboratories, which employ more than 2,000 staff, had 'made much
progress towards becoming more commercial and customer-focused and more
cost-conscious organisations'.
The review, involving independent consultants, will consider options
including privatisation or franchising.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: US denies visa application by Sinn
Fein chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US State Department has once again refused to grant a visa to Mr Gerry
Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, reversing a
campaign commitment made by President Bill Clinton before his election last
year.
A State Department spokesman confirmed yesterday that Mr Adams's visa
request had been refused under rules that exclude people who have been
involved in terrorist activity.
Mr Frank McCloskey, a Democratic congressman from Indiana, said he was very
disappointed by the decision. 'Generally speaking freedom of access and
people is the best route to go,' he said.
The refusal coincides with a visit to Washington by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the
Northern Ireland Secretary. In a radio interview in the US capital
yesterday, Sir Patrick refused to rule out re-starting talks on the
political future of Northern Ireland without the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of
the Democratic Unionist party.
'I would not want to anticipate any particular format,' Sir Patrick said.
Mr Paisley says he will not enter talks until the Irish government makes
further concessions on its constitutional claim on the six counties.
He also wants Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and
Labour Party, to stop talks with Sinn Fein.
Sir Patrick was due to meet attorney-general Janet Reno yesterday, as well
as with a number of members of Congress interested in Northern Ireland,
including Mr Thomas Foley, Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Mr Adams, who has had visa requests refused several times under previous US
administrations, had hoped to visit the US for a book promotion tour.
Last April, during a hard-fought primary election in New York state,
candidate Clinton told a gathering of Irish-Americans that he thought it
would be 'totally harmless to our national security and would widen the
political debate in this country' to grant a visa to Mr Adams.
He added, however, that he would support a visa for Mr Adams 'or any other
properly elected government official recognised by the US.' Two days later,
Mr Adams lost his seat in the British parliament.
Mr Clinton's initial promise to appoint a peace envoy to Ulster has been
scaled down since his election to a fact-finding mission, then becoming a
'willingness to send some kind of representative . . if both parties believe
it would help move talks forward.'

MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, yesterday welcomed 'unreservedly' new

He told the Newspaper Society, which represents regional and local

would take the debate forward. Mr Major also emphasised that he would be
reluctant to introduce a statutory press complaints tribunal.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Disability benefit service
criticised
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE delivery of the new Disability Living Allowance has been a 'nightmare'
for many claimants, the Commons social security committee said in a report
yesterday.
Disability Living Allowance and Disability Working Allowance replaced
previous benefits for disabled people in April 1992. There was, says the
committee, a 'tremendous surge of claims' for which the government's
Benefits Agency was not prepared.
By April last year the agency was already swamped with work and it soon
became apparent that it was in 'complete administrative disarray'.
The committee says it is evident that, a year after introduction of the new
benefit, many people were still waiting for too long for decisions on claims
for Disability Living Allowance. 'We believe that in certain very serious
cases the delays in paying Disability Living Allowance are tantamount to
maladministration.'

FT  06 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs set to attack unified Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs will this month criticise details of the move to a unified Budget,
saying the government has wasted an opportunity to ensure that the annual
Finance Bill is more accurately drafted, David Owen writes.
The Treasury and Civil Service select committee will also express concern
that the new arrangements will reduce parliamentary time devoted to Treasury
matters.
But it is expected to welcome the principle of switching to a unified tax
and spending format commencing this November. The committee is expected to
publish a report before the end of this month.
The committee will argue that by moving the deadline for parliament's
discussion of the Finance Bill forward from August 5 to May 5, the
government has spurned a chance to extend the period when it can take
outside advice.
By allowing longer gaps between the different stages of parliamentary
debate, the government could have helped to ensure the measure better
reflected its intentions.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour ready for union offensive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPORT within the Labour party for the proposals loosening the party's
links with the unions is to be mobilised shortly in a counter-attack to the
campaign against the reforms mounted by some of the largest unions.
Since February, when Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, threw his weight
behind the plans to end the unions' ability to vote in the selection of
parliamentary candidates and in the election of leader and deputy leader,
some of the biggest unions have been vigorously opposing the move.
At least some of the biggest unions will need to be won over, as the unions
will still account for 70 per cent of the total vote when the issue is
discussed at the party's annual conference in October.
The basis of the decision will be a recommendation from the ruling National
Executive Committee, which will be drawn up in July, after the present
consultation period is over.
The counter-attack is intended to shame the unions into not using their
block votes to kill the reforms. It will highlight the extent of support for
the changes within the constituency parties as well as among Labour MPs, and
underline the weapon that would be handed to the Tories if the reforms were
defeated.
Most prominent in the campaign against the loosening of the links have been
the Transport and General Workers Union, the GMB general union, and the
National Union of Public Employees. But late last month Usdaw, the
shopworkers' union, voted narrowly to retain a union vote in the selection
of Labour parliamentary candidates, against the recommendation of the
union's executive.
Mr Bryan Gould, a former shadow minister and candidate for the Labour
leadership, last night accused the party of failing to land a blow on the
Tories 'through the worst recession for two generations' in the influential
left-of-centre paper Tribune.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Political Notebook: View from the terraces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETREAT on Wednesday. Defeat on Thursday. Thus his opponents were
celebrating last night Mr John Major's climbdown on the Maastricht treaty
and the forecast Conservative defeat in today's Newbury by-election.
Only 10 days ago Mr Major was leading his ministers from their Whitehall
bunkers in a rival set of celebrations. The economic green shoots were
firmly established, the political tide had turned. The prime minister was
back in charge.
But yesterday he was forced to acknowledge that the courts rather than his
government would have the final say on Maastricht. The cheers this time came
from the curious, not-to-say unholy, alliance of Labour, Liberal Democrat
and Tory Euro-sceptic MPs on the social chapter.
No one should be surprised by the change. Britain's politicians are more
susceptible than most to manic swings in mood. The flavour of the football
terrace is nurtured daily by their ritualised clashes in the Commons
chamber.
But the odds are that just as the euphoria which greeted the 'official' end
to the recession was overdone so too will be the gloom which will follow the
Maastricht retreat and the expected loss of Newbury.
That loss, of course, must not be taken for granted. The lesson from last
year's general election is that the consensus can be wrong. No one trusts
opinion polls any longer.
But holding Newbury after the cataclysms of the past year would be an
extraordinary achievement for the prime minister. The 9.2 per cent swing
required by the Liberal Democrats is well within the range of their
by-election victories during the last parliament. The government is as
unpopular as it has ever been. Newbury is a prosperous constituency but it
has been as badly hit as any by the recession.
Against that background a decision by the voters that it was too risky even
in a by-election to turn out the Conservatives would carry a chilling
message for the opposition parties. If the government can escape even a
serious protest now it can do what it likes before the next general
election.
The temptation for political commentators would be to pack up and go home in
the certain knowledge that permanent Conservative government had indeed
arrived.
So the assumption at Westminster is that by Friday Mr Major's already
fragile parliamentary majority will be reduced to 19 and that the
Conservatives will lose control of perhaps half-a-dozen or more counties in
the local elections.
Nor could the natural eloquence of Mr Douglas Hurd's speech in the Commons
hide the fact that the government had been forced into an damaging retreat
on the social chapter. Few at Westminster doubt that Maastricht will in the
end be ratified. But the courts will now decide when and how.
So the fragile confidence of the Tory backbenches has taken another knock.
There will be the usual demands at the weekend for inquests, for the
government to get a grip. The Liberal Democrats, likely to be the biggest
gainers in the local elections, will celebrate their return to the political
limelight after a year in the shadows.
But what of Mr John Smith's Labour party? It can revel for a day or two in
the government's discomfort over Maastricht. Lady Thatcher's planned
appearance today to renew her call for a referendum should add to its cheer.
Labour, consigned to oblivion in Newbury, might do better than expected in
the county elections.
But a year after its fourth election defeat it is displaying neither the
energy nor the innovation needed to transform its longer-term political
fortunes. Lest that judgment is deemed partisan, it was offered by a
prominent member of the shadow cabinet.
This weekend the party's newly-created policy forum will consider three
documents designed to shape their policies on the economy, Europe and the
constitution.
If there is a single theme it is that the opposition must frame its
instinctive trust in the state in terms of its role in liberating the
individual.
The idea is developed most convincingly by Mr Tony Blair in his introduction
to the paper on the constitution. Mr Gordon Brown meanwhile has discarded
more of the economic baggage which the party carried during the 1980s.
But overall, the documents leave little sense that the opposition is making
a decisive break with the past. Nor do they dispel the impression that each
attempt by Mr Blair to define its future as a modern social democratic party
is being confounded by back-room plotting among trades union barons to
preserve their empires.
Mr Smith's supporters may have less to cheer than Mr Major's.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Campaigning Newbury Tory candidate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tory candidate Julian Davidson and his party chairman Sir Norman Fowler
taking a break during campaigning in Newbury yesterday.
Mr David Rendel, the Liberal Democrat candidate, appears to have gained
support in some traditionally staunch Tory areas. Both the Conservatives and
the Liberal Democrats are predicting a close result in today's by-election.
Labour meanwhile is confining itself to expressing an expectation that the
Tories will lose, insisting that such an outcome would not herald the end of
the two-party system

FT  06 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Upturn 'pre-dates ERM exit'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN's economic recovery pre-dates its exit from the European exchange
rate mechanism - and sterling's devaluation is not the only reason for
growth returning, Mr John Major said yesterday.
'Anyone who argues that leaving the ERM was the sole cause of recovery
should inform themselves by looking at the facts,' the prime minister told
the Newspaper Society in London.
As well as underlining the government's increasing conviction that recovery
is underway, his remarks revealed a determination to take on Euro-sceptics'
opposition to a fixed exchange rate regime.
'Interest rates had been cut from 15 to 10 per cent before last September.
Gross domestic product had stabilised before September and started growing
again in the second half of last year.
'It's now clear that retail sales, industrial production and manufacturing
investment all started to recover from around the middle of last year,' Mr
Major said.
Recovery was still 'in its infancy but it's growing daily,' Mr Major said.
He warned that the continuing recession in Europe would affect Britain's
growth performance.
The prime minister used his speech to set out the two themes for the
Commons' legislative programme starting in the autumn: tackling crime and
de-regulation. He said much of the progress that the government has made
over the last year had been obscured by debate over the economy and
Maastricht.
'We have already fulfilled rather more than a third of the commitments we
made in the (1992 election) manifesto. In fact, more manifesto pledges have
been honoured in the parliamentary year since the 1992 election than was
achieved after the elections of 1979, 1983 and 1987.'

FT  06 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Doubts over legal challenge to
Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S claim that it could press ahead with ratification of the
Maastricht treaty despite its embarrassing climbdown over the social chapter
won the backing of legal experts last night.
The retreat marks the start of a legal wrangle that could overshadow the
rest of the bill's parliamentary passage.
Legal experts said there were no obvious constitutional objections to use of
the royal prerogative to ratify the treaty's social protocol. Lawyers also
indicated that anti-treaty campaigners appeared to have no grounds for
seeking a judicial review at this stage and that the courts would be very
reluctant to interfere.
The acceptance yesterday by the government of an amendment to the bill
ratifying the Maastricht treaty that calls for the deletion of the protocol
on the social chapter has led Conservative Euro-sceptics to claim the
government cannot legally ratify the treaty.
The Euro-sceptics argue the amendment means legislation approved by
parliament could prove insufficient for the government to sign the
Maastricht treaty. They will seek a judicial review of ministers' use of the
royal prerogative.
Specifically, Tory Euro-sceptics believe that the government will not have
the power to contribute to the administrative costs of the social chapter.
The government argues that, even though the protocol will be excluded from
domestic law, it still stands in the treaty. Britain can ratify the treaty
because the protocol imposed no burdens on the country that required
domestic legislation. The social chapter opt-out remains.
Labour agrees broadly with the government that ratification has not been
stopped. But Mr George Robertson, Europe spokesman, says a 'series of
minefields' have been created that can only be solved by accepting the
social chapter.
As Britain has opted out of the social chapter, the protocol does not
require changes to be made to UK employment legislation.
Mr David Vaughan QC, a European law expert, said great play was made by
those who believed parliamentary ratification was required for the social
protocol of the terms of the 1978 European Assembly Elections Act.
Section 6(2) of that act provides that no effect can be given to any
protocol or treaty which results in any increase in the powers of the
European parliament without the approval of the UK parliament.
But Mr Vaughan said that it was clear from Hansard that at the time the 1978
act was passed, parliament was not so much concerned with preventing extra
powers being given to the European parliament as with preventing any
decrease in the powers of Westminster.
Parliamentary approval would therefore have been required for opting-in to
the social chapter but not for opting out, because opting out has no effect
on Westminster's social or employment powers.
Lawyers also believe Euro-sceptics may face insurmountable problems in
trying to persuade the courts to hear a legal challenge.
Sir William Goodhart QC said it was difficult to see who would have the
necessary standing to bring an application for judicial review.
Mr Vaughan agreed. 'There are limits to judicial review,' he said, adding
that a legal challenge could only happen once the Maastricht bill was in
force, but even then, he said, it was difficult to see how the courts could
intervene.
A challenge by a taxpayer on the grounds that the government has no
parliamentary authority to spend taxpayers' money on contributions towards
the expenses incurred by EC institutions might get off the ground. But the
Crown clearly had power to spend money on treaty obligations, and the courts
would be very reluctant to say the government could not, he said.
None of this could happen until the Maastricht bill was in force and even
then it was not clear that one taxpayer would have sufficient standing to
mount a legal challenge nor what his remedy would be.

<TEXT>
Page 1, line 18 (clause 1), after 'Community', insert 'with the exception of
the Protocol on Social Policy on page 117 of Cm 1934'.
Amendment 2 to the
European Communities
(Amendment) Bill.
DEPENDING on who is asked, Labour's briefly worded 'amendment two' - as
accepted by the government yesterday - could throw a legislative spanner
into the Maastricht bill, halting British ratification. Or it will force the
government to sign up for the social chapter. Or it can simply be flung
aside as ratification moves ever closer.
The immediate consequence is that the protocol on the social chapter agreed
at Maastricht, which included an opt-out for Britain, will not be part of
the legislation approved by the Commons. But the effect that this will then
have is far from clear.
EURO-SCEPTICS argue the amendment means legislation approved by parliament
could prove insufficient for the government to sign the Maastricht treaty.
Confusion has thus been created. They will seek a 'judicial review' of
ministers' use of the royal prerogative - the formal mechanism used to sign
treaties.
Specifically, Tory Euro-sceptics believe the government will not have the
power to contribute to the administrative costs of the social chapter, which
the government will probably help pay in spite of supposedly having opted
out.
THE GOVERNMENT argues that, even though the protocol will be excluded from
domestic law, it still stands in the treaty. Britain can ratify the treaty
because the protocol imposed no burdens on the country that required
domestic legislation. The social chapter opt-out remains.
Incorporation of the protocol into UK law was 'desirable' for the sake of
neatness but not 'essential,' Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, told
MPs yesterday.
Financial costs to Britain of administering the social chapter are
insignificant and can probably be charged to the Treasury's 'consolidated
fund' under the European Communities Act 1972, ministers believe.
LABOUR agrees broadly with the government that ratification has not been
stopped. But Mr George Robertson, Europe spokesman, says a 'series of
minefields' have been created that can only be solved by accepting the
social chapter.
There could be a case for judicial review on ratification; certainly there
is now moral pressure on the government to accept the social chapter. There
might also be challenges in the European Court of Justice by British workers
who - now the opt-out is removed from UK law - demand that the social
chapter's provisions should apply to them.
Separately, Liberal Democrats, who also back the social chapter, argue that
extra powers for the European Parliament have to be agreed by the Commons.
The effect of the amendment is to override that principle - offering a fresh
avenue for a legal challenge.

MR PADDY Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday predicted up to 80
council-seat gains for Liberal Democrats in the local elections. 'Liberal
Democrats do better in the ballot box than in opinion polls, especially in
local council elections,' he said.
Decisions on the future structure of local government in Scotland will be
announced in a white paper before the summer recess, it was announced last
night. Mr Allan Stewart, Scottish local government minister, said the new
authorities were expected to assume 'full control' in April 1996.

leader of the Democratic Unionist Party.
'I would not want to anticipate any particular format,' Sir Patrick said in
an radio interview in Washington DC.
Mr Paisley says he will not enter talks until the Irish government makes
further concessions on its constitutional claim on Northern Ireland. He also
wants Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour
party, to stop talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing.
Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, has been refused a visa to visit the

BRITAIN's economic recovery pre-dates its exit from the European exchange

FT  06 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories face rebuff in
mini-referendum - David Butler scans the political landscape ahead of
today's local authority elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY two-thirds of the British electorate have a chance to vote in county
council elections but most won't be voting on local issues or politicians.
They will be taking part in a mini-referendum on the government's
performance.
Although a majority are not expected to bother to cast their votes, the
elections still matter because of their verdict on the Major administration.
On the whole the votes will mirror what the opinion polls have been telling
us. Even where they run frugal, well-managed councils, the Conservatives
will fare badly - their current poll ratings are worse than in 1985 or 1989,
the last times the counties voted.
Tomorrow's headlines will be bad news for a government that had hoped to be
basking in the spring of economic recovery. The gloom is likely to be
heightened by the loss of Newbury. After the longest gap (10 months) between
parliamentary by-elections since 1689, a safe Conservative seat seems set to
go to the Liberal Democrats. The Conservative spin doctors may find a stray
council victory against the tide but they will be lucky if they can match
their 1990 achievement; then they masked disastrous local results by adroit
highlighting of the isolated triumphs in Westminster and Wandsworth.
What happens today will be little remembered a few months hence let alone at
the end of the four years that remain of this parliament. More and more
power has been taken from local government as Westminster and Whitehall
intervene ever more directly in education, policing and housing (or pass
control over to unelected quangos). Few citizens will in fact notice the
consequences if on Friday control of their county hall moves from
Conservative to Labour or, more likely, from Conservative to no overall
control.
Local services and even council taxes will not change much under any party
regime. Yet the atmosphere of politics will be significantly affected. A
swing away from Conservative control in some counties could give new impetus
to Labour-Liberal Democrat co-operation.
Such party co-operation gathered pace in 1985 when more than half the shire
counties in England and Wales suddenly fell into the category 'no clear
control'.
A new era of cohabitation began with local Lib-Lab, Lib-Con, or even Lab-Con
coalitions or understandings.
Some worked well, some worked badly but, in a time when local elections have
become more and more party-dominated, partisanship of-ten came to be
diminished by sensible collaboration. The number of hung counties diminished
to 15 but it is bound to jump up again this week. Surrey, Buckinghamshire
and West Sussex seem to be the only places where the Conservatives can feel
completely assured of a clear majority. The government's dealings with the
Association of County Councils will become more abrasive.
Spin doctors for Labour and the Liberal Democrats are already trying to
build up the possibility that the Conservatives will lose control of a
series of southern, traditionally Tory counties. They would claim this as a
victory.
In this centralised country the government will still govern strongly. But
with a recovery-driven surge in the opinion polls, it may soon feel able to
dismiss this month's manifestation of popular discontent. A cut in its
parliamentary majority from 21 to 19 may not, however, be altogether
unimportant to the government's hard-pressed and hard-pressing Whips.
Labour is likely to gain control of a few councils - Avon, Lancashire and
Northamptonshire seem the best bets. But the shire counties are, for the
most part, not good Labour territory.
The winners on Friday should be the Liberal Democrats. In 1989 they were in
a bad way. This time it is the government that is in a bad way. Mr Paddy
Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday predicted up to 80 gains for
his party in the local elections. 'Liberal Democrats do better in the ballot
box than in opinion polls, especially in local council elections,' he said.
If Mr Ashdown's troops fail to elect their man in the Newbury by-election,
together with a host of county councillors, they should feel very
disheartened. If they do well, they can count on a boost in the opinion
polls as well as in money and membership. But, much more important, the
green shoots of party co-operation will be given a hormone implant. We shall
hear a lot more of Lib-Labbery and electoral reform.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Bank stresses ERM unease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER distancing of Britain from early re-entry into the European
exchange rate mechanism was signalled yesterday by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton,
the governor of the Bank of England.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton, speaking in New York two months ahead of his retirement,
said: 'Exchange-rate stability is the result of convergence in underlying
economic policies and performance. It cannot be achieved by actions in the
exchange markets alone.'
The speech was interpreted as an effort by Mr Leigh-Pemberton, Bank governor
for 10 years, to downplay the significance of the ERM as a future plank of
UK economic policy.
It is likely to irritate many of the UK's European partners, who see
sterling's early re-entry into the ERM as vital to economic and monetary
union.
Although global co-ordination of economic policies was important, Mr
Leigh-Pemberton told the Institute of International Bankers that the
'primary international responsibility of each country is to set its own
house in order'.
Underlining the unease about the ERM shared by many in the UK government
since Britain's forced exit last September, he said: 'Attempts to move
exchange markets in directions that are not consistent with underlying
policies nearly always end in disappointment.'
The speech underlines the scepticism shared by some Bank officials that the
ERM discipline could ever have been construed as a replacement for tough
domestic policies aimed at price stability.
Avoiding reference to moves to create a single currency for Europe, the
governor said the efforts to establish an economic and monetary union should
primarily be to 'remove unnecessary regulations, open markets to
competition, and eliminate barriers to trade'.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Advice on mortgage choices attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORTGAGE ADVICE from banks, building societies and mortgage brokers is
usually misleading or inaccurate, according to the latest findings of
Which?, the Consumers' Association monthly publication.
The magazine says advisers overwhelmingly recommend endowment mortgages  -
where the loan is linked to a life insurance savings policy - which pay
commission to the mortgage institution selling them.
The research was carried out at 100 lenders in Cardiff, Edinburgh, London
and Manchester.
Which? found that in 78 per cent of cases involving a mortgage
recommendation an endowment was said to be the best type even though a
repayment mortgage - where interest and capital is repayed over the term of
the loan - was at least as suitable.
'Mortgage advice is too often biased with an eye to lucrative commissions,'
said Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the Consumers' Association.
She added: 'Advisers frequently twisted the facts in their eagerness to sell
endowment policies, often downplaying the merits of suitable repayment
mortgages.'

<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT last night warned of an upsurge in illegal motor insurance
operations and published a list of six companies believed to have issued
insurance without authorisation in the past three months.
Mr Neil Hamilton, a trade and industry minister, said a further four cases
were being investigated to establish whether insurance issuers were acting
legally.
He said: 'Many of these cases have involved targeting particular groups of
motorists who have been affected by rises in insurance premiums.' Young
drivers and those with convictions were among those groups.
The companies believed to have issued motor insurance without proper
underwriting by an authorised insurer are: Westbridge Corporation Ltd -
trading through Red Rose Insurance Consultants in Bolton;
Royal Lytham Insurance/Royal Lytham Holdings of Lytham St Annes;
Sunrise Insurance Co (UK) Ltd/L&amp;G Security Ltd of Neath;
Crest Motor Securities (UK) of Ipswich - trading as Springwood Insurance
Services;
Sterling Motor Securities UK Ltd/Sterling Union Assurance - trading through
Nationwide Insurance Bureau Ltd;
Westbridge Corporation Ltd - trading through Paul Rogers Insurance and

FT  06 MAY 93 / Tecs offer ways to cut jobless tally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNDREDS of ways to reduce unemployment, including re-skilling up to 400
workers to decommission Soviet nuclear submarines, have been submitted to
the government by Training and Enterprise Councils.
Tecs, which administer state-funded training schemes for the jobless, were
invited by the government to compete for an extra Pounds 21m to run projects
to cut unemployment in the present financial year.
The deadline for appli-cations was yesterday. Tecs have taken a variety of
approaches. Birmingham Tec has looked for a closer working relationship
between itself and the Employment Service, which runs non-training options
such as Jobclubs. It wants to offer employers a single 'gateway' for
recruitment.
Aztec in south-west London has submitted two proposals. The first proposes
an allowance of up to Pounds 75 a week to help jobless people with the
transition from benefits to a work pattern involving a number of part-time
jobs. It also suggests training grants for employers to support recruitment
of the long-term unemployed.
Cumbria Tec is submitting a project whereby former VSEL shipyard workers,
employed by a newly created marine technology transfer company, would be
trained to decommission Soviet submarines. An initial 10 people would be
retrained, with possibilities for up to 400 being involved in the long term.
Ideas had to be new, they had to be capable of being set up by September and
of making a significant contribution to reducing unemployment. The
government expects to fund between 12 and 24 projects.
Many Tecs, while applying for the extra funding, have been critical of the
scheme known as Tec Challenge. One critic said worthwhile schemes take more
than a few months to set up and 'Tecs are not interested in short-term
wheezes that are intended to massage the government's unemployment
register'.
The government yesterday placed more small companies outside the scope of
the industry training levy.
In future companies with combined payroll and payments to labour-only
sub-contractors of less than Pounds 61,000 a year will not be subject to the
levy. The previous ceiling was Pounds 45,000.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Consumer interest points to recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
CONSUMER INTEREST in buying goods and services has shown a big increase
since the beginning of the year, although it stabilised between February and
March, a business information company said yesterday.
The levelling off in enthusiasm for purchases shown by an index compiled by
NTC Research adds to fears that the recovery may be weak.
The index, taking in TV advertising, job vacancies, share prices, interest
rates and retail sales, leapt from 114.23 in January to 127.76 in February.
In March it moved up only fractionally to 127.89.
Vodafone, the Newbury-based mobile telephone company, yesterday added to
evidence that the recovery is under way by reporting that April was its best
month for three years.
The company added a net 18,766 subscribers to its network in April - the
largest number of new subscribers since May 1990 - bringing total
subscribers to 856,000.
A year ago the monthly tally for new subscribers was running at about 5,000
net.
Figures for new connections by cable TV companies offering phone services
also show strong growth.
According to the Independent Television Commission, the first three months
of the year saw an increase of a third in the number of residential and
business lines, taking the total number of exchange lines installed to
143,660.
Meanwhile the UK's electronics industry is seeing signs of recovery after
two years of stagnant sales. Mr Cyril Teed, president of the EEA electronics
industry trade association, said last night at its annual dinner that new
orders rose by 7 per cent last year and were back at 1989 levels.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Aid signalled for private landlords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT may have to provide further assistance to encourage private
landlords to increase their presence in the housing market, the prime
minister said yesterday.
Speaking at the Harry Simpson Memorial lecture in London, Mr Major said:
'There is clearly a need for a larger private-rented sector in Britain. We
have released some of the old shackles on landlords. But we may need to go
further if the sector is to show any significant growth.'
Ministers have been contemplating incentives to revive the private-rented
sector but this is the first time, according to officials, that the prime
minister has signalled the possibility of providing further assistance to
landlords.
Sir George Young, the housing minister, in particular is thought to be keen
to reinvigorate private renting which at the turn of the century provided
about 90 per cent of housing compared with less than 7.5 per cent by 1990.
He yesterday welcomed the prime minister's comments, which he said
underlined the government's commitment to private renting.
The Treasury is also thought to be receptive to moves to encourage private
renting which could improve the supply of housing without restarting an
inflationary rise in house prices.
Private renting previously has been encouraged by the 1988 Housing Act which
restricted tenants' rights and gave landlords greater freedom to set rents.
An extension of the Business Expansion Scheme also provided tax breaks for
investors in housing for rent. The scheme finishes at the end of this year.
Mr Major said, however, that the great majority of people still wanted to
own their own home. He was pleased by recent signs that stability was
returning to the housing market but he did not want to see a return to a
'frenetic market with prices rising dramatically'. This would be
inappropriate for the housing market and the economy, he added.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Early ERM return ruled out by Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER distancing of Britain from early re-entry into the European
exchange rate mechanism was signalled yesterday by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton,
the governor of the Bank of England.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton, in what amounted to a swan-song speech in New York two
months ahead of his retirement, said: 'Exchange-rate stability is the result
of convergence in underlying economic policies and performance. It cannot be
achieved by actions in the exchange markets alone.'
The speech was interpreted as an effort by Mr Leigh-Pemberton, Bank governor
for 10 years, to downplay the significance of the ERM as a future plank of
UK economic policy.
It is likely to irritate many of the UK's European partners, who see
sterling's early re-entry into the ERM as vital to economic and monetary
union.
Although global co-ordination of economic policies was important, Mr
Leigh-Pemberton told the Institute of International Bankers the 'primary
international responsibility of each country is to set its own house in
order'.
In a passage underlining the unease about the ERM shared by many in the UK
government since Britain's forced exit last September, Mr Leigh-Pemberton
said: 'Attempts to move exchange markets in directions that are not
consistent with underlying policies nearly always end in disappointment.'
The speech underlines the scepticism shared by some Bank officials that the
ERM discipline could ever have been construed as a complete replacement for
tough domestic policies aimed at price stability.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton said Britain should focus clearly on 'medium-term goals
of price stability and budgetry consolidation'.
Avoiding reference to moves to create a single currency for Europe, which
some Bank officials think may be premature, the governor said the efforts to
establish an economic and monetary union should primarily be to 'remove
unnecessary regulations, open markets to competition, and eliminate barriers
to trade'.
He said the leading nations should step up efforts to improve bank
supervision and create more efficient banking payments systems.

<TEXT>
VODAFONE, the Newbury-based mobile telephone company, yesterday reported
April as its best month for three years, further evidence from business that
the recovery is under way.
Vodafone added a net 18,766 subscribers to its network in April, its best
month for new subscribers since May 1990. The total number of subscribers is
now 856,000.
A year ago the monthly tally for new subscribers was running at about 5,000
net.
The number of customers cancelling their subscriptions has also continued to
decline and is down to about one for every five new customers.
For the first time since Vodafone introduced its low-user tariff - called
LowCall - last October, the number of new subscribers opting for the full
business tariff exceeded the number of new LowCall connections.
Mr Gerry Whent, chief executive, attributed the growth to 'the combination
of support from the independent service providers, our marketing initiatives
and the undisputed quality of the Vodafone network'.
Figures for new connections by cable TV companies offering phone services
also show strong growth in recent months.
According to the Independent Television Commission, the first three months
of the year saw an increase of a third in the number of residential and
business lines, taking the total number of exchange lines installed to
143,660. The UK's electronics industry is seeing signs of recovery after two

FT  06 MAY 93 / Hoover 'misled union' on plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOOVER, the domestic appliances manufacturer, was accused yesterday by the
AEEU union of contradicting itself over the future of its UK operations,
Robert Taylor writes.
Mr Jimmy Airlie, the engineering and electrical union's Scottish chief
executive officer, said he had written to Mr Leonard Hadley, president and
chief executive of Maytag, the US parent company, asking him who was running
Hoover.
Earlier this year Mr Airlie negotiated an efficiency deal with Hoover that
resulted in its decision to transfer vacuum cleaner production from Dijon in
France to Scotland.
Last week doubt was cast over that when it became clear that the company was
reviewing all its European operations.
Mr Airlie said yesterday that Mr Hadley and the company's new European
president, Mr Gerald Kamman, appeared to have contradicted each other over
Hoover's Scottish plant at Cambuslang.
In his annual statement to shareholders on April 27 Mr Hadley said the move
was proceeding as planned.
Only a day earlier Mr Kamman wrote to every Hoover employee in Europe to say
that 'nothing will escape review'.

FT  06 MAY 93 / National Grid workers 'win 7.5%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL GRID, the privatised operator of the electricity transmission
system in England and Wales, has awarded its 5,400 workers pay rises
averaging 7.55 per cent, union officials said yesterday.
As part of the deal, involving sweeping changes in working practices,
employees will receive a 2.95 per cent wage increase backdated to February
1.
The company has also allocated Pounds 5.7m as an investment to fund lump-sum
payments averaging 1 per cent of salaries as well as transition payments
averaging Pounds 760 per person in return for staff co-operation in
accepting changes in their contracts of employment.
The company says the deal is worth 3.95 per cent plus an average Pounds 760.
But the Engineers and Managers Association, which represents 40 per cent of
the staff, says the deal will boost pay packets for workers, who on average
earn Pounds 21,000 a year, by just over 7.5 per cent.
The unions have accepted there will be a common salary structure for all,
and the introduction of 'single-table' bargaining through the creation of a
company council.
The deal also involves paying all staff monthly directly into their bank
accounts. The first steps are also being taken to end all overtime pay
within two years.
Increments are being abolished and replaced by individual
performance-related pay bonuses. A wide range of cash allowances are also
being scrapped or cut in value.
The unions have also agreed to a system of voluntary binding arbitration
over pay and conditions. This falls short of being a no-strike guarantee,
but the company says there is 'a clear understanding' that staff cannot
withdraw their labour in certain key areas.
The Engineers and Managers Association's members voted by 66 per cent to 34
per cent, on an 80 per cent turn-out, to back the deal.
Mr Nigel Petrie, the company's general manager, said the extra money
invested in the deal would be recovered through efficiencies and improved
profits within four years.
'We have to ensure we remain competitive and reduce our pay bill', he said.
He envisages a cut of a further 1,000 in staff numbers over the next two
years.
Mr Petrie added that the company and unions had signed 'a modern agreement ,
appropriate to the employment of staff in a major company in the 1990s.' He
claimed it would provide for 'greater unity of purpose and team working'.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Sunday trading 'endangers 19,000 jobs'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNRESTRICTED Sunday shopping would lower retail prices and raise
shopworkers' average wages but lead to the loss of 19,000 jobs in the retail
sector, according to an independent study commissioned by the Home Office.
It says tighter restrictions, favoured by unions, small shops and religious
groups, would create some jobs. But industry efficiency would suffer, retail
prices would rise and average wages would fall.
The study says about 40 per cent of shops currently open on Sunday in
England and Wales, when about 6 per cent of weekly shopping is done. But it
finds the trend has not perceptibly increased total retail sales and doubts
they would rise even if Sunday trading were wholly deregulated.
However, the study, which uses an economic model based on data supplied by
retailers, finds that the various options for changing the law now being
considered in Westminster would have widely differing effects on retailing
costs, employment levels and patterns of shopping.
The study was published as 245 MPs from all the main parties signed a
parliamentary early-day motion yesterday urging the government to support a
private member's bill which calls for stricter curbs on Sunday trading.
The motion noted that the bill - introduced by Mr Ray Powell, the Labour MP
for Ogmore, and backed by the Keep Sunday Special campaign - had been
amended in committee to allow Sunday opening by DIY outlets, garden centres
and convenience stores of up to 3,000 sq ft.
The study says that total deregulation - one of the options favoured by the
government - would cut retail prices by 0.3 per cent, saving the average
household Pounds 18.40 on its annual shopping bill.
But because the overall volume of trade would remain about the same, shops
would have to be more competitive to cover opening for an extra day. That
would would lead to some retailers going out of business and about 19,000
jobs disappearing, the report said.
The study, by the London Economics consultancy, forecasts that almost
two-thirds of shops in England and Wales would trade on Sunday if it were
made legal. It does not cost the amended version of Mr Powell's bill, but it
says that in its original, more restrictive, form, the bill would have added
0.4 per cent to retail prices, costing the average household Pounds 25.80 a
year.
The original bill would have created 22,500 retailing jobs, but cut the
average wage by Pounds 172 a year. It would also have led to expanded
retailing capacity.
The Shopping Hours Reform Council welcomed the study as a victory for
consumers, and said it supported its own proposals for partial deregulation.
But John Lewis Partnership, which does not open on Sundays, called it
'highly slanted'.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, commissioned the study last year
after offering parliament three options for Sunday trading reform. These
range from the present curbs to total deregulation.
The government's bill is expected to be included in the legislative
timetable for the next parliamentary session. Mr Powell's bill reaches the
Commons report stage later this month, but is thought unlikely to survive.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Dorrell claims rising support for oil tax reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT proposals to reform North Sea oil taxation are winning increasing
support from the oil industry and its supply companies, Mr Stephen Dorrell,
financial secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday.
He was speaking as Shell, the largest North Sea operator, indicated a shift
from a neutral to a mildly positive view of the tax changes, which have
provoked widespread criticism.
The Treasury minister said he had received many representations from the oil
industry but none contained any points that the government had not already
considered.
He had no plans to alter the changes proposed in the Budget. He said there
was growing acceptance that the new tax regime would result 'in a more
rational use of resources'.
Mr Dorrell also saw no need to amend the Budget's transitional arrangements.
Although oil companies have complained that these will radically alter the
tax treatment of legally binding commitments, Mr Dorrell said the companies
should look at their obligations on a pre-tax basis.
Backbenchers have tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill to try and cushion
the effect of the tax changes. The bill is being debated next week.
Shell UK, however, said that the life of large North Sea oilfields could be
extended by up to 10 years because of the changes. The company had
previously suggested the tax changes would lead to a reduction in
exploration activity. Mr Chris Fay, managing director of exploration and
production, said yesterday this would be more than offset by increased
development work.
The changes encourage companies to continue producing oil from the largest
North Sea fields since they reduce the tax rate from 75 per cent to 50 per
cent and abolish tax for new fields. But exploration companies have argued
that the changes will affect exploration by abolishing tax relief.
Mr Fay said the estimate of 10,000 job losses from the proposals was 'wholly
overstated'. Jobs will also be created by the additional development work,
he said.
Esso launched a new generation of cleaner diesel fuel yesterday that aims to
cut smoke emissions, improve operating efficiency and even smell better than
existing diesels. The fuel contains an anti-foaming agent and a deodorant.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Watchdog queries power prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSOR Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, yesterday
told generators to account for significant rises in power prices since April
following complaints from intensive energy users.
He also asked the National Grid, which runs the electricity distribution
system in England and Wales, to explain price 'spikes' - sharp rises over
short periods of time - and an increase in the 'uplift' charges levied to
cover administrative costs of running the wholesale electricity market.
The regulator's intervention comes as the market, known as the pool, moves
into the final stage of a review of its operations. This was prompted by
concern about the complexities of its operations but has been given added
impetus by the price rises.
In April the average pool purchase price was about 10 per cent higher than
in March and 20 per cent higher than during April the previous year.
Volatility has also increased. PowerGen, the smaller of the two main
generators, said the prices that it bids into the pool reflected the cost of
production.
It pointed out that Prof Littlechild had recently concluded that pool prices
were artificially low in the first two years of its operation following
privatisation.
Mr Ed Wallis, PowerGen chief executive, said price spikes may have occurred
in part because of inadequacies in pool software.
National Power, the other main generator, said that even at the higher pool
prices 38 per cent of plant was not recovering its cash costs.
Pool prices were also below those agreed with regional companies in recent
contracts for coal-fired electricity, it said.
The pool price rises will have only a marginal effect on domestic and
smaller commercial customers. They buy electricity directly from their
regional electricity company at price levels outside the pool.
Larger companies that pay pool prices are suffering. For some of them price
increases since privatisation have been sharp.
April's price rises followed the end of contracts concluded at electricity
privatisation between the two main generators and regional power companies.
Far fewer of the new contracts are covered by hedging agreements, and the
generators say this means they are bidding in nearer to the true costs of
generation.
Prof Littlechild, speaking at a conference on the reform of the pool,
indicated support for the idea of demand-side bidding under which large
users could be paid for shedding load.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Fall in pound rebounds on holiday costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEVALUATION of sterling yesterday hit the package holiday industry with
Thomson, Britain's largest travel company, blaming the weaker pound for
price increases of up to 10 per cent on holidays to some European ski
resorts.
Prices for all 1993-94 winter holidays sold by Thomson will, however,
increase by only 2 per cent after the company warned resorts they risked
losing UK business.
Thomson's winter programme, which goes on sale on Friday, provides the first
indication of how sterling's fall will affect big tour operators' prices.
This summer's holidays are unaffected by last September's devaluation
because tour operators had bought forward their foreign currency until next
October.
Ms Rosemary Astles, Thomson's marketing director, said price rises for
skiing holidays in France, Austria and Switzerland had been unavoidable.
Thomson has, however, increased its ski programmes in Spain and Italy, where
weaker local currencies have enabled the company to lower prices on some
programmes. Ms Astles said the price of skiing holidays in Italy had fallen
by 5 per cent overall. France, Austria and Switzerland account for 75 per
cent to 80 per cent of Thomson's ski programme for 1993-94 compared with 85
per cent last winter.
The prices of winter holidays in Florida have gone up by only 3 per cent, in
spite of sterling's weakness against the dollar. Ms Astles said Thomson had
been able to keep prices low because the US recession and the reluctance of
Americans to travel had caused an oversupply of Florida holiday
accommodation.
Thomson had warned all resorts they would not attract UK tourists unless
they took the weaker pound into account when setting prices. Ms Astles said:
'Our negotiating stance was to say: 'If you don't help us you will lose
business.' Not everybody helped us, but quite a lot of people realised that
it's no use having a price rise of 14 per cent.'
Thomson said sales of winter 1993-94 holidays through travel agents were
likely to be slightly up on last winter's 2.7m. UK and US government
negotiators yesterday began a new round of talks in London to attempt to
negotiate a new 'open skies' aviation agreement between the two countries.
The talks are expected to take several months.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Birt joins staff with Pounds 200,000 package
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Birt, director-general of the BBC, this week joined the staff of the
Corporation more than six years after coming to the organisation from London
Weekend Television, Raymond Snoddy writes.
Mr Birt signed a staff contract including a Pounds 200,000 pay package. His
predecessor Sir Michael Checkland, who retired just before Christmas, was
paid more than Pounds 140,000 until three months before his retirement but
he then received an increase to around Pounds 160,000.
It is believed that Mr Birt's deal was agreed in January and that
negotiations were effectively complete before a row broke about his
employment status in March. Mr Birt had been a freelance consultant while
deputy director-general. Independent Television News has called for an
independent audit of BBC World Service Television in its response to the
government's green paper on the future of the corporation.
It says although WSTV is meant to support itself financially its present
funding arrangements are too opaque to judge whether this happens.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Fishermen change focus of disruption campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH fishermen have launched a campaign of administrative disruption
aimed at frustrating the European Community's fisheries regime and UK
government policy on preserving stocks.
It emerged yesterday that fishermen's leaders secretly agreed last month on
a tactical switch away from blockades to non-compliance with EC quota
restrictions and new licensing that limits the number of days spent at sea.
Further blockades similar to those that have disrupted a number of UK ports
since the beginning of the year have not been ruled out however.
The new tactics emerged yesterday with leaders of the National Federation of
Fishermen's Organisations (England and Wales) and the Scottish Fishermen's
Federation urging their members to appeal against the new licensing
arrangements of the Sea Fish (Conservation) Act.
Mr Robert Allan, chief executive of the Scottish federation, said last
night: 'The name of the game is that we do not like it and we are resolved
to use all the instruments at our disposal to frustrate it.'
In the past week fishermen throughout the country have been refusing to hand
in their EC quota log sheets and landing declarations to local port offices
as required. Instead they have been sending them to different departments of
the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in London and elsewhere,
forcing delays and extra work for the government.
Yesterday's move follows the announcement on Tuesday by fisheries minister
Mr David Curry of the new rules under which fishermen's days-at-sea
allocations will be based.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Hoover accused of confusing workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOOVER, the domestic appliances manufacturer, was accused yesterday by the
AEEU union of contradicting itself over the future of its British
operations.
Mr Jimmy Airlie, the engineering and electrical union's Scottish chief
executive officer, said he had written to Mr Leonard Hadley, president and
chief executive of Maytag, the US parent company, asking him who was running
Hoover.
Earlier this year Mr Airlie negotiated an efficiency deal with Hoover that
resulted in its decision to transfer vacuum cleaner production from Dijon in
France to Scotland.
Last week doubt was cast over that agreement when it became clear that the
company is reviewing all its European operations.
Mr Airlie said yesterday that Mr Hadley and the company's new European
president, Mr Gerald Kamman, appeared to have contradicted each other over
the future of Hoover's Scottish plant at Cambuslang.
In his annual statement to shareholders in Iowa on April 27 Mr Hadley said
the move from Dijon to Cambuslang was proceeding as planned.
'We took a 1992 charge of Dollars 53m to cover the expenses of this European
reorganisation, but we expect to recover those charges in the future as we
will eliminate duplicate overheads, reduce labour costs and realise
economies of scale', he added.
Only a day earlier Mr Kamman wrote to every Hoover employee in Europe to say
that owing to financial losses 'nothing will escape review', including the
transfer of production from Dijon to Scotland.
Hoover was unavailable for comment yesterday.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Trade policies 'ignore consumers'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMERS' interests are ignored when protectionist trade policies affecting
them are agreed, according to the National Consumer Council.
In a report published today the council cites examples where trade
agreements had proved costly to consumers:
A deal between the European Community and Japan will raise the average price
of each Japanese car sold by Pounds 740 and cost EC consumers Pounds 23bn
over seven years.
EC anti-dumping measures on electronic goods, such as CD players, video
recorders and photocopiers, cost EC consumers and businesses some Pounds
1.3bn a year and UK consumers Pounds 270m.
The price of clothes in the UK would on average be 5 per cent lower if it
were not for the Multi-fibre Arrangement, which restricts imports from
poorer textile-exporting countries.
The argument that such protection saves jobs is denounced by Lady Wilcox,
who chairs the council, as a 'big myth'. Jobs may be saved in one sector at
the expense of others.
The report recommends speedy completion of the Uruguay round of multilateral
trade negotiations. It also calls for trade policies to be 'formed in
public, justified in public and evaluated in public, with the costs and
benefits of any measures proposed spelt out and widely debated.'
An independent body should be set up in the EC to evaluate costs and
benefits of trade policy actions. Consumers' representatives should also be
allowed access to non-confidential information on the basis of which EC
decisions are made, notably in anti-dumping.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S powerful civil service trade unions are gearing up for a fight over
demands by provincial and local governments for concessions aimed at curbing
budget shortfalls.
Tensions are most apparent in Ontario, where a social-democratic government,
elected in 1991 with the backing of organised labour, has called for
CDollars 2bn (Pounds 1bn) in wage cuts. The government has warned that
40,000 jobs could be at risk if unions failed to agree a belt-tightening
'social contract' ahead of the provincial budget later this month.
Ontario, which has been one of the heaviest borrowers on international
capital markets this year, risks having its credit rating cut if it fails to
bring its 1993/94 budget deficit down from a projected CDollars
16bn-CDollars 17bn to CDollars 10bn-CDollars 12bn.
Three of Canada's four biggest unions represent public sector workers. Led
by the 407,000-member Canadian Union of Public Employees, they are generally
more militant than their private-sector counterparts.
The governments appear to be banking on limited public support for the
unions. In a provincial election in Newfoundland earlier this week the
ruling Liberal party won a big victory on a platform of public-sector
austerity.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD BANK shareholder countries have sent management back to the drawing
board to produce a new set of measures for improving the implementation and
supervision of loans.
Executive directors representing the member countries rejected a first-draft
action plan called 'Next Steps' as an inadequate response to a commission's
report which documented an alarming deterioration in the performance of the
World Bank's loan port-folio. The commission was chaired by Mr Willi
Wapenhans.
The report said that more than 75 per cent of World Bank projects showed
acceptable performance, but noted a steady deterioration in portfolio
performance.
The proportion of projects with significant problems rose from 11 per cent
in 1981 to 20 per cent in 1991.
The World Bank has been caught in the unfavourable spotlight cast in recent
weeks on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, its sister
multilateral bank.
Some members of Congress are treating the Clinton administration's request
for funds for the International Development Association, the concessional
loan arm of the World Bank, with as little enthusiasm as they are showing
for EBRD funding.
But the administration, although at first hesitant about the size of the IDA
contribution negotiated by its predecessor, is throwing its weight behind
the request, involving a Dollars 1.25bn (Pounds 796m) US contribution this
year.

FT  06 MAY 93 / US reviews drug sentencing policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MS Janet Reno, US attorney-general, has ordered a review of federal
prosecution and sentencing policy for drug offences in a move which may head
off a revolt by federal judges.
Many senior judges are refusing to hear drug cases because of their
objections to the sentencing rules. Judge Harold Greene, a prominent federal
judge in Washington, last week rejected the minimum sentencing rules as
unconstitutional.
Both Ms Reno, who as state prosecutor in Miami introduced an innovative
rehabilitation programme for first-time drug offenders, and Mr Lee Brown,
the former New York City police chief appointed last week to head President
Bill Clinton's drug control office, are expected to shift the focus of drug
policy away from enforcement towards treatment and prevention.
Tougher prison sentences have been the linchpin of US policy for drug
offences over the last 10 years. Sentencing rules effective from 1987
require a sentence of at least five years for possession with intent to
distribute 5 grams of crack cocaine.
Anyone convicted of selling drugs within 1,000ft of a school must serve at
least one year in prison without parole.
Critics of the rules say they can lead to excessive sentences for the small
fry in drug deals, and compel judges to order inappropriate prison sentences
for non-violent drug users who deal to support a drug dependency and who
might respond better to treatment.
But others argue that tougher sentences are needed to clamp down on drugs,
and that the mandatory rules make it harder for criminals to escape prison
by plea bargaining.
'Mandatory minimums are based not on an unthinking reflex but on sound
philosophy; effective deterrence depends both on severity and on certainty
of punishment,' said Mr Bob Martinez, head of the Office of National Drug
Control Policy under former President George Bush.
Some of the harshest critics of the mandatory sentencing rules, however, are
the judges who have to administer them, and who complain that they simply do
not work.
'It results in some tremendous inequities in the sentencing process, and
judges are uncomfortable with that,' said a spokesman for the Judicial
Conference, the governing body of the federal judicial system.
The prison system, too, is coming under increasing pressure. Over the last
10 years the federal prison population has nearly tripled. This results
almost entirely from drug offenders, who accounted for 58 per cent of
federal prisoners at the end of 1991 against 26 per cent a decade earlier.
Over the same period the average sentence for drug offenders convicted in
federal courts rose from four to seven years, while the average sentence for
violent crime fell from 10 1/2 years to 7 1/2 years.
In the state system, the percentage of drug offenders in the prison
population has tripled to 22 per cent.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Warhol works disappoint - New York Art Auctions

   THE biggest art sales of the year

<TEXT>
of impressionist, modern, and contemporary paintings and sculpture -
produced mixed fortunes for Sotheby's and Christie's in the opening two
sessions in New York this week, writes Antony Thorncroft.
Sotheby's sold only 53 per cent of the 78 lots on offer by value, for a
total of Dollars 8.8m (Pounds 5.7m). There was negligible bidding. The great
disappointment was Andy Warhol - with only two of 12 paintings by him
finding buyers. 'Old Telephone', painted in 1961, made Dollars 552,500,
below estimate.
It was a bad evening for Mr Charles Saatchi, who was trying to sell his
version of Carl Andre's bricks, 'Equivalent VI'. The Tate Gallery has never
been forgiven for paying Pounds 6,000 for Equivalent VIII, another group of
firebricks by Andre, but the price now looks cheap. Mr Saatchi was hoping
for Dollars 300,000 for his version; in the event they failed to sell.
Paintings by Franz Kline and Clyfford Still, both of which were expected to
top Dollars 1m, were also not sold. The more experimental sculpted works did
best, with auction records for Mark di Suvero's creation of weathered
timber, rope and nails (which fetched Dollars 470,000), and for Donald
Judd's construction of 10 stainless steel units fitted to a wall at six-inch
intervals (Dollars 233,500).
In contrast, Christie's was encouraged by its Tuesday auction, selling all
the top lots. The most important contemporary painting on offer this week,
'Number 19, 1948' by the leading abstract expressionist artist Jackson
Pollock, in which he dripped and poured paint on to the canvas, sold for
Dollars 2.42m, slightly above its top estimate, to a private European
collector.
A 1967 painting by Francis Bacon, 'Study for a portrait in a revolving
chair', was on target at Dollars 1.2m, while 'White Brushstroke I' by Roy
Lichtenstein, in which he parodied the spontaneous brush stroke which
characterised abstract expressionism, made Dollars 728,500.
There was keen bidding by European and American private collectors at the
Christie's auction. Other names to sell were Robert Rauschenberg, whose
'Nettle' fetched Dollars 717,500, and Jasper Johns, whose 1980 'Untitled'
realised Dollars 607,500.
The prices are well below levels of four years ago but they suggest that
more modest estimates attract buyers back to the market.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Beige Book eases fears on economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RECENT reports may have led to unnecessary anxiety about economic prospects,
the Federal Reserve's latest Beige Book survey of regional economic
conditions implied yesterday.
The generally upbeat report cites a 'modest improvement in economic
conditions across much of the nation' last month, following a dip in
activity in March caused mainly by severe winter weather. Manufacturing
output, retail sales and home sales were all said to be improving.
The survey was conducted in the weeks up to April 23.
Manufacturers in most districts reported increases in sales and orders, with
near-capacity production at some car and steel plants. Strong demand for car
parts and electronic equipment was reported in Boston and Chicago.
The outlook for jobs was mixed, with hiring in most regions expected to be
restricted; higher output mainly reflected productivity gains and increased
overtime.
The Fed survey was also upbeat about consumer spending, reporting a modest
rebound in retail sales in most areas after widespread declines in March.
The revival was led by durable items such as furniture and home appliances.
Retailers in San Francisco, however, blamed concern about job security for
lower than expected sales.
Most districts reported 'strong or improving' residential housing markets,
although commercial real estate remained in the doldrums.
Where bank lending increased it was mainly for consumer loans or mortgage
refinancing. A few districts, including Atlanta, Kansas City and St Louis,
reported a pick up in commercial loans, especially to small businesses.
The Fed survey is regarded as a reliable guide to regional trends. Its
relative optimism contrasts with a series of gloomy national statistics,
including sharply reduced growth in the first quarter and recent steep falls
in the purchasing managers' index and leading economic indicators.
Employment figures for April, due out tomorrow, will be scrutinised for
evidence of a pick up in activity after the subdued first quarter.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Ontario pay threat enrages unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S powerful civil service trade unions are gearing up for a fight over
demands by provincial and local governments for concessions aimed at curbing
budget shortfalls.
Tensions are most apparent in Ontario, where a social-democratic government,
elected in 1991 with the backing of organised labour, has called for
CDollars 2bn (Pounds 1bn) in wage cuts. The government has warned that
40,000 jobs could be at risk if unions failed to agree a belt-tightening
'social contract' ahead of the provincial budget later this month.
Ontario, which has been one of the heaviest borrowers on international
capital markets this year, risks having its credit rating cut if it fails to
bring its 1993/94 budget deficit down from a projected CDollars
16bn-CDollars 17bn to CDollars 10bn-CDollars 12bn.
Three of Canada's four biggest unions represent public sector workers. Led
by the 407,000-member Canadian Union of Public Employees, they are generally
more militant than their private-sector counterparts.
Mr Andrew Jackson, economist at the Canadian Labour Congress, said
traditional ties between the labour movement and the New Democratic party -
which governs in Ontario, British Columbia and Saskatchewan - were unlikely
to deter unions from acting in their members' interests.
The governments appear to be banking on limited public support for the
unions. In a provincial election in Newfoundland earlier this week the
ruling Liberal party won a big victory on a platform of public-sector
austerity.
Under legislation passed last year, federal civil servants' pay scales are
frozen for two years in return for almost total job security. But Mr Donald
Mazankowski, finance minister, said in last week's budget that Ottawa wanted
to reopen the job-security deal.

FT  06 MAY 93 / World Bank loan check plan rejected
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD BANK shareholder countries have sent management back to the drawing
board to produce a new set of measures for improving the implementation and
supervision of loans.
Executive directors representing the member countries rejected a first-draft
action plan called 'Next Steps' as an inadequate response to a commission's
report which documented an alarming deterioration in the performance of the
World Bank's loan portfolio. The commission was chaired by Mr Willi
Wapenhans.
'We worked closely with other member countries in determining that the first
response was not satisfactory, and we joined with the others in sending
management back to the drawing board for further work,' Mr Lawrence Summers,
the US Treasury under-secretary in charge of international affairs, told a
House of Representatives committee yesterday.
'We made clear that the initial response went insufficiently far to respond
to concerns about the need for more adequate supervision of bank projects,
and much more emphasis on implementation rather than on approval of loans,'
he said.
The Wapenhans report said that more than 75 per cent of World Bank projects
showed acceptable performance, but noted a steady deterioration in portfolio
performance. The proportion of projects with significant problems rose from
11 per cent in 1981 to 20 per cent in 1991.
The World Bank has been caught in the unfavourable spotlight cast in recent
weeks on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, its sister
multilateral bank. Some members of Congress are treating the
administration's request for funds for the International Development
Association, the concessional loan arm of the World Bank, with as little
enthusiasm as they are showing for EBRD funding.
But the Clinton administration, although at first hesitant about the size of
the IDA contribution negotiated by its predecessor, is throwing its weight
behind the request, involving a Dollars 1.25bn (Pounds 796m) US contribution
this year.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Democrats hold Aspin seat by tiny margin

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE White House breathed a small sigh of relief yesterday when the
Democratic Party narrowly held on to the House of Representatives seat from
Wisconsin occupied for 22 years by Mr Les Aspin, now defence secretary.
Mr Peter Barca's margin - 50-49 per cent, or about 700 votes - compares with
Mr Aspin's 58-42 per cent victory last time. Mr Barca's Republican opponent,
Mr Mark Neumann, was threatening to demand a recount.
In another special election in a very conservative district of Ohio, the
Republicans won easily.
Although by-elections often favour the political opposition, a combination
of a defeat in Wisconsin together with the likelihood of the loss next month
of the Democratic Senate seat from Texas will not have helped President Bill
Clinton's political authority at a time when he needs it most.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARAB delegations yesterday agreed to continue talks with Israel until the
end of next week, encouraged by the prospect of a meeting with US President
Bill Clinton. Syria had earlier warned it would consider breaking off the
current ninth round of talks on Friday, unless there were better prospects
of progress.
The White House has not yet confirmed that Mr Clinton will receive the
delegations, but a senior Arab diplomat said yesterday that the symbolic
significance of the US president becoming directly involved for the first
time since the process opened in October 1991 was enough to ensure the
delegations remained in Washington.
Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation, warned
however that continued Israeli violence against Palestinians in the occupied
territories was damaging the atmosphere at the negotiations. She said that
the killing of eight Palestinians during the previous 48 hours had caused a
visible deterioration in relations.
Mrs Ashrawi added she was also disappointed Israel had not yet announced the
names of further Palestinian deportees who would be allowed to return to
their homes. 'Israeli intentions must be judged by what they do on the
ground, as much as by what happens in the negotiations,' she said.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Panic in Amman over Iraq's border closure with Jordan
</HEADLINE>

   AMMAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The closure of Iraq's border with Jordan and an announcement that the
pre-Gulf war 25 Iraqi dinar banknote was to be withdrawn from circulation
caused panic in Amman yesterday, James Whittington reports from Amman.
Thousands of Jordanians gathered around the city's official foreign
exchanges for information on what to do with the millions of banknotes held
in the beleaguered Iraqi currency.
Many Jordanians hoarded Iraqi dinars on the assumption that when UN
sanctions were lifted the dinar would regain its former strength and huge
profits would be made.
The Iraqi authorities have issued a deadline of one week during which the
banknotes can be exchanged for valid currency within Iraq, but the offer
does not apply inside Jordan.
'There has been mayhem. So many people have lost all their savings. They
can't believe what Saddam has done,' says a money changer who had to call in
the police to control crowds around his office.
Around ID120m was exchanged each day on the Jordanian market, according to
foreign exchange dealers. One finance ministry official estimates that at
least JD60m (Pounds 56m) was lost overnight.
Traders said the local branch of Iraq's state-owned Rafidein Bank refused to
take the notes from them and transfer them to their accounts in Iraqi banks.
Calls from anguished dealers poured into Jordan's central bank asking if
Amman had any plans to intervene to help them change the Iraqi money.
The Iraqi dinar has been popular with currency speculators and private
investors in Jordan since the Gulf crisis. Its rate against the dollar has
fluctuated from between 45 to 104 over the past four months. The official
fixed rate is ID0.31 to the dollar. The original Swiss-printed 25 dinar
note, as opposed to photocopied versions printed after the Gulf War was the
most popular denomination with private investors. Its withdrawal has caused
bitterness from many in a nation which was Iraq's closest ally during and
after the Gulf crisis.

DR Hiroshi Nakajima, controversial director-general of the World Health

of the 185-nation UN agency.
But the vote, 93 to 58, displayed unexpectedly strong disapproval of his
handling of WHO affairs, making it likely that his second term will be as
turbulent as the first.
The vote at WHO's annual meeting followed a heated debate on a report by
external auditors which revealed 'shortcomings' in financial controls
relating to contracts for executive board members. Dr Nakajima, a Japanese,
was nominated for re-election by the 31-member executive board by 18 votes
to 13, amid accusations by the US and other donor nations that Japan had
used threats and inducements to win developing country votes.
Western countries opposed to Dr Nakajima have made clear that they will
insist on sweeping reforms in management and financial accountability at
WHO, which has a two-year budget of Dollars 1.8bn. Mr Walter Broadnax,
deputy secretary-designate at the US Health Department, warned in a speech
that 'only managerial and leadership changes can prevent further erosion in
programme effectiveness'.

THE ECONOMIC rebuilding of a post-apartheid South Africa would be hampered
unless multilateral organisations acknowledge wealth disparities and
reclassify it as a developing country, Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC president,
warned last night, Our Foreign Staff writes.
In a speech for delivery at Westminster to MPs and peers, he said the
classification as a middle-income country was a 'false perception', ignoring
the fact that 'the majority of our population, which happens to be black,
lives in conditions of dire poverty'. Mr Mandela, who will be in Geneva
today, said eligibility for aid from such bodies as the UN Development
Programme was being put at risk because 'so rich are the few that are rich
that it becomes impossible to see that the poor exist at all'.
Earlier he met Mr John Major, UK prime minister, to outline difficulties in
the transition to democracy.

In Beijing the foreign ministry, without naming the Khmer Rouge, rebuked its

Mr Falt said about 200 Khmer Rouge fired an estimated 200-300 rounds of

A SENIOR delegation from Bahrain's central bank and finance ministry will
next week make an official visit to their counterparts in South Africa,
taking what officials in Manama call a 'major step' towards developing trade
and investment ties between the two countries.
The visit will mark the most substantial economic and diplomatic overture
towards South Africa from the Gulf since Pretoria began dismantling
apartheid and crowns a series of initiatives, led by Bahrain, to attract
South African investment into the region.
A trade and investment accord was signed in Bahrain on Tuesday between
Kanoo, one of the Gulf's biggest trade groups, and Omega Investments, a Cape
Town-based business consultancy. Bahrain officials say the May 10 visit by
representatives from the Bahrain Monetary Agency promises to develop such
ties. 'We're flying the flag, and putting up markers for the future,' said
one.
Bahrain has no diplomatic relations with Pretoria, though ministers from
both countries have engaged in a flurry of exchange visits in the past year.
And while Gulf countries still technically maintain the internationally
applied sanctions against South Africa, reforms in the republic have
encouraged Bahrain, in particular, to ignore them. 'There is acquiescence to
consider them no longer there,' said Mr Tareq Almoayed, Bahrain's
information minister.
The Bahrain delegation intends to examine South Africa's exchange controls
and trade policy with particular attention to the banking sector, in the
hope of tempting big South African banks to establish branches in Bahrain.
The arrival of a batch of South African banks would be a considerable fillip
to the island, which has seen its pre-eminence as the Middle East's banking
sector eroded in recent years.

Britain called for 'a different management culture' to ensure funds were
used 'with probity and provide good value for money'. Canada, France,
Denmark and the Nordic countries were also highly critical.
On Tuesday Dr Nakajima promised reforms 'to tighten up management and
administration and to revitalise WHO's structure to achieve greater
efficiency, transparency and accountability'.
A reorganisation already in train will curb the powers and influence of
three key members of staff implicitly criticised by the audit report. But Dr
Nakajima is also criticised by western donors for lack of leadership and
vision and by many of his staff for autocratic management. Critics say these
concerns will not be assuaged by administrative changes, however desirable
these are.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Sanctions bite hard on hungry Iraqis: Border closure is an
attempt to halt economic collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRESSED in black robes, Shia women from Iraq sit on the pavement in the
Jordanian capital, Amman, selling illegally imported cigarettes. Twenty, 30,
sometimes 40 women line up in groups on al-Hashimi Street, in front of the
main taxi rank and in view of King Hussein's palace, to earn a few extra
pennies for their hungry families in Baghdad.
Squeezed by nearly three years of sanctions against Iraq, the women say they
have had no choice but to make the 14-hour drive by taxi from Baghdad to
Amman every fortnight or so for their families to survive.
Yesterday the taxis were halted. The Baghdad authorities closed the border
in what was described as a temporary measure so they could withdraw the 25
Iraqi dinar banknote. With inflation rampant in Iraq, the notes, printed in
Switzerland before the Gulf war, circulate widely outside the country and
are valued more highly than the locally printed currency issued since.
Iraqi holders of the ID25 notes were given a week to exchange them. The
border closure, to be kept in place until Monday, is a sign of Baghdad's
desperation to regain control over its collapsed economy.
'There is no work in Iraq, the rationing system is not enough to live on and
prices are too high,' says one of the women, who did not wish to give her
name. An estimated 1,000-2,000 Iraqis travel between Jordan and Iraq each
day.
Already this week the Baghdad government has announced stiff duties on
foreign travel. A fee of ID15,000 (around JD180, or Pounds 163, on the Amman
black market) is to be charged to Iraqi citizens, with the exception of
diplomats and students, on leaving the country.
The measures indicate that the Iraqi authorities may be losing their
economic battle. Living conditions of the population, in particular the
people in the northern governates and the Shias, continue to deteriorate.
United Nations officials and foreign diplomats privately predict instability
in the country unless the economy recovers soon.
Market prices of basic necessities have increased by more than half in the
past three months and prices for all foodstuffs remain many times higher
than before the UN sanctions were enforced in August 1990 after the invasion
of Kuwait.
The price of wheat is 72 times higher than in July 1989, rice 45 times,
cooking oil 32, lentils 88, milk 68, sugar 59 and tea 60 times.
In addition to this hyperinflation, the purchasing power of the population
has been drastically reduced. The average minimum monthly wage is ID150,
rising to an average ID400 for civil servants, but Iraqis claim that at
least ID1,000 a month is required to feed a small family.
Mass starvation is avoided by the Iraqi government's monthly rationing
system, which was increased by 20 per cent this spring. UN officials in
Baghdad point out that this is not enough to prevent severe malnutrition
among the poorest. According to a UN report on the humanitarian needs of
Iraq, the monthly ration quotas of flour (9kg), rice and oil (1.75kg each)
and sugar (1.5kg) provide only 68 per cent of minimum energy requirements.
Although the distribution of subsidies is effective in most areas, northern
governates such as Mosul and Kirkuk are reported to receive only 6 to 10 per
cent of their ration entitlements. In view of this, the report estimates
that nearly 1.7m Iraqis, from a population of around 18m, need food aid for
an extended period.
Iraqi travellers to Amman say that those in the former middle class now have
two or more daily jobs and are forced to sell personal assets and family
treasures to survive.
But many are unable to cope. There has been an unprecedented rise in the
number of destitutes and unemployed. According to the UN report, Iraq's
ministry of labour and social affairs has registered 450,000 destitute
persons whose monthly income is less than ID50. A further 263,000 have
applied to be included.

FT  06 MAY 93 / No firm US promise for Patten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Chris Patten, the governor of Hong Kong, said yesterday he had received
guarded assurances from the Clinton administration that it hoped its
policies towards China would no longer be subject to an annual confrontation
with Congress.
Reporting on three days of talks with administration officials, including
President Bill Clinton, and members of Congress, he conceded it was
politically inevitable that renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trading
status with the US would this year be hedged around with conditions
concerning external and internal Chinese policies.
Given the change of government in Washington, he repeatedly said, US policy
'is unlikely to be what it was last year.' He had put Hong Kong's case for
an unconditional renewal of MFN and added that it was possible to 'devise
conditions that do less damage' to the colony. The US, he emphasised, was
'still making up its mind' on China.
But Mr Patten said that he had been told - though not by Mr Clinton himself
 -that the US would prefer 'that the annual MFN debate did not become the
centrepiece of US policies towards China.'
His discussions have included sessions with the congressional sponsors of
the Mitchell-Pelosi bill attaching conditions to MFN renewal, ranging from
human rights and missile sale policies, on which the administration must
take a position by June 2.
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat, said she was impressed
by Mr Patten's arguments but doubted they would much affect the immediate
legislation. The governor said he never expected to change the
congresswoman's view.
Mr Patten said he had argued that there were US means other than MFN renewal
to press for acceptable Chinese policies on weapons proliferation. He noted
that the UK, France and Australia were among those nations pursuing
'bilateral dialogues' with China over human rights. Trade issues could also
be dealt with on their specific merits.
Mr Patten also distanced himself from a recent delegation to Washington from
the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, increasingly influenced by
Beijing, which had warned of severe consequences for the US economy.

FT  06 MAY 93 / US calls for Asian Bank loan review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday called for an independent review of the Asian Development
Bank's loan portfolio in a policy statement which underlined US reservations
about a proposed doubling of the ADB's capital and reaffirmed sharp
differences between Washington and Tokyo over the bank's future.
Mr Jeffrey Shafer, designated by President Bill Clinton as US assistant
treasury-secretary for international affairs, argued at the ADB's annual
meeting in Manila that Asian countries owed their economic success more to
the investments arising from their own thriftiness than to money from
abroad.
The ADB, he said, should be thrifty too. 'It need not - and it cannot - go
on rapidly increasing its lending year by year,' he said. 'More
consideration of the scale of lending and the adequacy of current resources
is needed before a decision on a capital increase can be taken. There is
time for this.'
Mr Shafer said the bank should put more stress on reversing the declining
quality of its projects than on expanding its portfolio.
Although the Clinton administration's policy and staff dealing with
multilateral financial institutions have yet to be finalised - Mr Shafer
left soon after his speech to attend his Senate confirmation hearing in
Washington - the US delegation in Manila did emphasise the Clinton themes of
helping the poor and protecting the environment.
'Growth as measured by the GDP accounts can become an obsession, the
environment can become degraded in its pursuit, leaving future generations
worse off, not better off,' Mr Shafer said. 'This is unsustainable
development.'
Other western shareholders in the ADB - with their own national budget
problems - - gave qualified support to the US call for thrift. Germany, for
example, backed the idea of an independent examination of the ADB's
performance but said the bank needed more capital to expand its activities
in poorer countries.
Mr Kimimasa Tarumizu, the Japanese ADB president, has called for a doubling
of the bank's present capital of Dollars 23bn. He has been strongly
supported by the Japanese government and developing Asian countries such as
Indonesia which receive ADB loans.
Yesterday Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the Japanese finance minister, gave
unequivocal support to the proposed capital increase in his speech to the
ADB governors. 'The bank's . . . own calculations indicate that its ordinary
capital operation may reach the lending limit some time in the second half
of the next year at the latest,' he said.
Asked what he thought of the US proposal for an outside inquiry into ADB
loans, Mr Hayashi said an internal task force, as proposed by Mr Tarumizu,
was the 'sound and orthodox way'.
China and India, which each borrow about Dollars 1bn a year from the ADB in
ordinary loans, yesterday reiterated their appeals for credit from the ADB's
soft-loan window, the Asian Development Fund.
Although China and India are poor enough to qualify for ADF assistance,
donors have so far refused to allow them access to funds because they fear
the demands from the two largest populations in the world would be too
heavy.

<TEXT>
MR LI PENG, China's 65-year-old premier, has not been sighted in public for
two weeks, prompting speculation that he may be suffering from a more
serious illness than first indicated.
Chinese officials explained his failure to keep an appointment with visiting
Philippine President Fidel Ramos late last month by saying that he was
suffering from a cold, and that he had been taken to hospital.
The Chinese language Hong Kong newspaper Ming Pao reported on Monday that Mr
Li had been suffering from heart problems. Mr Wu Jianmin, foreign ministry
spokesman, has been endeavouring to dampen speculation about Mr Li's health,
telling reporters: 'There's no point speculating about. . . He's just got a
cold. That's very common.'
Western officials discount a 'political illness'. Mr Li was recently
re-confirmed at a session of China's parliament, or National People's
Congress, to a second five-year term. No hint has appeared that he might be
in political difficulties. Health details of China's leadership are normally
closely guarded secrets.
China's premier was photographed playing tennis on April 20 with Mr Goh Chok
Tong, the visiting Singapore prime minister. There was no indication then of
any infirmity, although photographers noted that Mr Li remained on court
only for about 15 minutes.
His disappearance has inevitably revived discussion about the health of Mr
Deng Xiaoping, China's 88-year-old senior leader, who was last sighted in
Shanghai in January during the spring festival.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Ecuador shows lead in international anti-corruption drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ECUADOR is expected to become the first government to sign a new
international anti-corruption code of conduct and restrict the award of
official contracts to local and foreign companies which have made the same
pledge.
The move has been initiated by Transparency International, the
anti-corruption organisation launched in Berlin yesterday. Transparency
International officials hope that three or four other countries will also
soon form what are termed ''islands of integrity' as part of the campaign
against corruption.
Mr Alberto Dahik, vice president of Ecuador, told a conference attended by
more than 60 government officials, businessmen and development experts that
corruption was as great a threat to economic growth in developing countries
as Aids. A substantial proportion of Ecuador's Dollars 13bn debt had been
wasted on unnecessary contracts and projects and accompanying kickbacks.
Examples from Ecuador's own experience, he said, included the purchase of
nine locomotives and two aircraft worth Dollars 120m.
Mr Peter Eigen, chairman of Transparency International, said the
organisation would help 'erode the taboo' that surrounds public discussion
of corruption, and lead a coalition spanning governments, development
agencies, the business community and citizens in the fight against it.
'The creation of Transparency International reflects the intense frustration
and anger among government and business leaders in many countries about the
impact of corruption,' said Mr Eigen, a former World Bank official. 'The
concern is global in origin and nature. The crisis of corruption is not the
exclusive domain of international development, but has reached critical
proportions in the so-called developing world as well.'
The business community has generally been cautious over Transparency
International's request for moral and practical support, partly from concern
that committing themselves to the code of conduct would leave them at a
commercial disadvantage over rivals which dismiss the code.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S commitment to play a wider role in United Nations operations is
facing its stiffest test as the nation reacted with shock to the killing of
a Japanese policeman on peacekeeping duty in Cambodia.
Mr Haruyuki Takata, a 33-year-old civilian policeman, was killed on Tuesday
in an ambush on a six-vehicle convoy of peacekeepers. Nine other personnel
with the UN transitional authority in Cambodia (Untac) were wounded in the
ambush, four of them Japanese. The ambush is being blamed on the Khmer
Rouge, which is boycotting elections to be held on May 23-27.
Japan's involvement in Cambodia followed a painful political debate over the
conditions in which it would join UN peacekeeping operations. The killing
threatens to reopen that debate.
Leaders of the governing Liberal Democratic party tried to calm alarm about
the risks to unarmed peacekeepers. Tele-vision news programmes were
specially extended to discuss the killing, which dominated coverage in most
newspapers.
Mr Yohei Kono, chief cabinet secretary, tried to head off calls for the
government to consider withdrawing Japan's personnel, a move which the
leadership recognises could cause political embarrassment with Japan's
international partners.
Mr Kono said the 1991 Paris peace accord for Cambodia was still in force
even although it had been violated by the incident. The peace accord is the
basis for Japan's involvement in peacekeeping operations in Cambodia.
Mr Kono, speaking after the first meeting of a government task force set up
to decide Japan's response to the killing, said the government was calling
on Untac to strengthen security for Japanese personnel, relocate civilian
police officers to safer areas and gather all Japanese volunteers in Phom
Penh, the capital, to discuss security.
However, the government announced that more than 50 Japanese monitors for
the election would be sent as planned next week.
Japan is also sending an 11-strong team to investigate the killing. It is
likely to press the UN to review the character of the peacekeeping operation
in Cambodia in the light of increasing Khmer Rouge violence in rural areas.
Japan has 600 military personnel in southern Cambodia, mainly building
roads, and 70 civilian police volunteers.

A PLANNED visit by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Japan this month has
been put off until later in the year, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Mr Sergei Svistunov, a presidential spokesman, said yesterday: 'The visit
has been postponed by mutual agreement.' Mr Yeltsin caused a political storm
in Japan last year by postponing a visit just four days before it was due to
start.
The president had been expected to visit Japan at the end of May. Interfax
news agency said the trip could be rescheduled for September or October.
Japanese newspapers on Tuesday said Mr Yeltsin might call off the trip
because of a territorial row between the two countries and political
tensions at home.

JORDANIAN businessmen and currency dealers counted their losses yesterday
after Iraq withdrew from circulation old, premium-priced banknotes in an
attempt to shore up the Iraqi dinar at home, Reuter reports from Amman.
The ID25 notes have been hoarded in Jordan and the Gulf by speculators
waiting for the fall of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein or the lifting of
United Nations trade sanctions to boost the sharply devalued currency.
'I have been wiped out overnight with all my small savings,' said Mr Zein
Ayyad, 40, who had put most of his JD8,000 (Dollars 11,700) savings into the
now-withdrawn Iraqi currency. 'I do not believe there is a house in Jordan
that has not been hurt by this move.'
Baghdad closed its border with Jordan at midnight and gave Iraqis a week to
exchange the ID25 notes, known as the 'Swiss version' or 'originals', for
those printed in Iraq since it invaded Kuwait in 1990.
Jordanians had no place to turn for compensation. 'Outside speculators in
possession of 'Swiss dinars' have been caught with their pants down. . . the
move clearly was to stop them gaining,' said Mr Mifleh Aqel, a senior
Jordanian banker.
'It will boost the purchasing power of the dinar held inside Iraq by
reducing the money supply and prevent the holders of outside notes from
using them to increase inflation on goods.'
Traders said the local branch of Iraq's state-owned Rafidein Bank refused to
take the 'Swiss' notes from them and transfer them to their accounts in
Iraqi banks. Calls from anguished dealers poured into Jordan's central bank
asking if Amman had any plans to intervene to help them change the Iraqi
money.
'Originals' have also been amassed by traders who delivered goods to Iraq.
'We have official papers proving we took it out in return for goods we gave
them,' said Mr Ibrahim Salem, a food merchant, showing Iraqi certificates.
Baghdad's move angered many Jordanians who backed Iraq during the Gulf war.
'All this support for Iraq has come to nothing,' said Mr Ali Odeh, a
disgruntled investor.

AUSTRALIA is trying to organise a meeting of the Cairns Group of
agricultural exporting nations to put pressure on the Group of Seven
industrialised countries to complete the stalled Uruguay Round of world
trade talks.
Mr Peter Cook, trade minister, has called for a meeting of trade ministers
from the 14-country group on the eve of the next G7 summit, expected to take
place in Tokyo in July.
Officials said the government believes that a formal meeting of the group
would step up international pressure on the G7 nations to resolve the
remaining areas of disagreement, which include liberalisation of farm trade.
The group, chaired by Australia, was formed to press for the extension of
Gatt rules to agricultural trade, which had been excluded in previous
rounds. It has said it will not accept a Uruguay Round deal which fails to
achieve reductions in farm support, border controls and tariff protection.
The group, includes New Zealand, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia,
Uruguay, Fiji, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and Hungary.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Russians ready to play the capitalist game: Privatisation is
steadily shifting economic control away from Moscow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin's referendum victory appears not to have
resolved the power struggle between supporters and opponents of economic
reform which rages at the political centre - but in the regions, away from
Moscow, reforms are steadily being entrenched by the government's mass
privatisation programme.
Ministers and advisers at the headquarters of GKI (GosKomImushchestvo), the
state property committee which is managing the privatisation programme under
the direction of Mr Anatoli Chubais, the deputy prime minister, can barely
contain their excitement.
In December, when voucher auctions for medium- and large-scale companies
began, 18 companies were sold. In April, 558 enterprises in 54 regions were
up for tender, making the reformers' target of 5,000 sales by the end of the
year more realistic.
In total, 1,547 of the 26,000 companies which employ more than 200 workers
or have assets valued over Rbs1m, will have been sold this month. Of these,
372 enterprises employ more than 1,000 employees and account for 86 per cent
of total employment in privatised enterprises.
Add to this the 33,400 small enterprises that were privatised last year and
the reason for the reformers' satisfaction becomes apparent.
'Medium-scale privatisation is going like a train,' says Mr Maxim Boiko, a
senior adviser to Mr Chubais.
It is not surprising that parliamentary opposition to Mr Chubais has grown
in recent months, accompanied by repeated calls for his resignation.
'The Chubais programme is really undermining the power of the state
authorities,' says Mr Sergei Vassiliev, director of the government's Centre
for Economic Reform. 'They thrived on ill defined property rights. That is
why they oppose him.'
Yet in the regions, governments - and, to a less extent local parliaments -
are increasingly supporting the Chubais programme, with 71 regions, out of
about 90, organising auctions this month.
In Volgograd, 600 miles south of Moscow, Mr Konstantin Ogloblin, director of
the state property fund which sells property on behalf of GKI, is
unequivocal: 'I support the policy of Mr Chubais and his programme of
voucher privatisation,' he says.
The Volgograd state property fund has privatised 37 companies since January,
ranging in size from about 100 employees to 26,000 at a giant tractor plant,
and is privatising at the rate of 13 companies a week. Most privatised
enterprises are now largely owned by the workers and managers, who generally
choose to exercise their right to purchase 51 per cent of the available
shares in the enterprises.
Critics doubt that privatisation will produce either new investment or
restructuring, especially if worker-shareholders prevent managers from
laying off surplus workers.
'I like Chubais,' says Grigory Yavlinsky, an economist and critic of the
government. 'But what he is doing is not clear. You have to cut the roots
from the bottom up - to separate housing from the enterprise and then
de-monopolise. Only after that can you privatise.'
But in Volgograd the process of restructuring is slowly beginning. At Red
Dawn, a washing machine factory producing 190,000 washing machines a year,
the managing director plans to lay off 150 of his 700 workers after
privatisation.
Shop-floor workers at Red Dawn appear to accept the management's right to
manage. 'People are expecting lay-offs,' says Uri, a 30-year-old engineer.
'The staff used to be against privatisation but now they are in favour. The
first people to be fired will be the drunks, the ill-disciplined and the
lazy-bones.'
As an exercise in popular education, the Volgograd privatisation effort is
impressive. With western help from the International Finance Corporation,
the private sector investment arm of the World Bank, and Soviet-style hype
in form of dozens of smart, new posters that bravely declare:
'Privatisation] Hundreds of businesses await your choice]', the citizens of
the city are being encouraged to use their vouchers to invest.
In spite of the sheer complexity of the privatisation system, the signs are
that much of the population of the Volgograd region is prepared to give this
new capitalist 'game' a go.
Under the rules, each Russian has been issued with a rouble privatisation
'voucher' which has a nominal face value of Rbs10,000 - a sum they can top
up with money of their own. The vouchers can be sold on for cash, used to
purchase shares in their place of work, 'invest' in one of the five new
investment trusts, or purchase a limited quantity of shares in the companies
up for auction at Volgograd's new share auction house, a former trade union
building.
There, business is brisk as a stream of local Russians arrive to invest
their vouchers in shares for local enterprises.
Mr Georgy Tseplalov, a 58-year-old farmer and shop owner, had travelled 200
miles to invest his vouchers in Konfil, a sweet factory. With a flash of
entrepreneurial pleasure he admits that he has collected 10 vouchers by
purchasing them at reduced rates from his fellow villagers. 'I know the
factory and I think it has a good future,' he says.
Lena Tereshinko, 35, arrived with a neighbour to buy shares in four local
chemical factories: 'We want to invest our vouchers to get the best returns
for them,' she says, adding with a laugh: 'There's not much else we can do
with them - Rbs10,000 these days won't even buy a proper pair of boots.'

<TEXT>
IG METALL, Germany's powerful engineering union, will today step up strikes
throughout eastern Germany following the breakdown of negotiations in
Saxony.
A further 24 enterprises, including four steel plants, will be targeted, and
a strike ballot will be held next week in the metal and engineering sectors
of the three remaining states of Saxony-Anhalt, Berlin-Brandenburg, and
Thuringia.
More than 30,000 workers in 24 enterprises are on strike. If it continues,
IG Metall could bring what remains of eastern German industry to a
standstill by calling out all its 400,000 members.
Yesterday's negotiations in Dresden broke down after failure to agree which
enterprises might be excluded from paying wage increases of more than 20 per
cent, or a postponement of the income parity timetable. The union wants
Gesamtmetall, the metal and engineering employers' association, to reinstate
a contract signed in 1991 which would have brought wages in eastern Germany
to western levels by next year. The employers cancelled the contract because
of the recession.
The strike has hit factories throughout the former Communist state.
Volkswagen, which has a greenfield plant in Mosel, Saxony, said production
for the Golf car was at a standstill. The plant employs 2,600, and produces
380 vehicles a day. But production at Mosel accounts for only 8 per cent of
Volkswagen's Golf output.
Production at a subsidiary of electronics group AEG has also been halted,
with a third of the 900 workers on strike. The company said loss of
component supplies from the Dresden plant was costing it about DM400,000 a
day. The plant accounts for 1.7 per cent of AEG's turnover.
Siemens, which employs 17,000 people in eastern Germany, said yesterday that
2,600 were on strike. It expected turnover of DM5bn (Pounds 2bn) in the
region this year, a small percentage of its total turnover of DM78bn. All
its plants had offered 9 per cent rises, as recommended by the employers.
But BICC, the British-based international cable company, committed to
investing DM80m in its KWO Kabel plant in eastern Berlin, said it was
determined to make the company competitive, and link wages to high
productivity levels. 'We have offered our 2,200 employees a pay rise of 18
per cent. We have already paid for April,' it said. IG Metall has not
responded to the offer.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Commission opens doors for E Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission has recovered its nerve. A new package of measures
to accelerate the political and economic integration of six eastern European
countries into the EC is bolder than expected, a rebuff to criticism of the
Community's response to the collapse of communism.
The proposals support improved, across-the-board market access for east
European products; faster dismantling of EC tariffs; more Commission-led
lending to finance infrastructure; and a commitment to eventual membership.
None of these offers goes as far as the Poles, Czechs, Hungarians, Slovaks,
Bulgarians, and Romanians would like, and they fall far short of the
privileges of full membership. But the initial response is positive.
A Polish official described the measures as 'ambitious', and argued that it
was unrealistic to expect bigger moves by the EC. A Hungarian diplomat
agreed: 'We have a very positive reaction. The acceptance of future
membership as a shared objective is a very important political signal.'
The Commission's proposals reflect a new alliance between Sir Leon Brittan
and Mr Hans van den Broek, the EC commissioners responsible for external
economic and political relations respectively. The two have apparently set
aside earlier rivalry and championed the cause of freer trade.
'Improved market access is the most effective way of encouraging economic
growth and the transition to market economies,' proclaims the document,
which attacks the notion that increased imports from eastern Europe will
cause lasting damage to EC members caught in recession.
It points out that the EC moved from an Ecu1bn (Pounds 790m) trade deficit
in 1991 to an Ecu1.7bn (Pounds 1.34bn) surplus in the first 11 months of
1992. Furthermore, eastern Europe accounted for just over 3 per cent of
total EC imports (less than Norway), yet the EC accounted for more than half
the total trade of eastern Europe.
The chief trade liberalisation elements are:
Lifting customs duties on industrial goods such as cars and chemicals by the
end of 1994 - a two-year advance. Scrapping tariffs on 'sensitive'
industrial goods at the end of the second year after the agreement comes
into force.
Moving from a quota-based system which sets rigid targets for imports into
less restrictive ceilings. This means east Europeans will not automatically
face higher tariffs if they breach import targets.
Advancing by six months plans to reduce levies by 60 per cent on meat, dairy
produce and vegetables from eastern Europe. Quotas are to be raised by 10
per cent, too.
Scrapping duties on steel imports at the end of the fourth year - ahead of
schedule but subject to new agreements with eastern Europe.
Brussels officials predict a battle with member states over market access if
the document is to win approval at next month's EC summit in Copenhagen.
France, Spain and Portugal are all nervous about greater market access;
Germany and Britain want a generous approach, if possible with more
'front-loading' so there is an immediate pay-off for east European
exporters.
The political proposals are also proving controversial. Mr van den Broek
lost his fight to insert 1995 as the date for a review conference to assess
the east European's progress toward EC membership.
Another suggestion is to invite a committee of eminent personalities from
western and eastern Europe to report to a future EC summit on how to foster
closer ties.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Italian deputies end vote secrecy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S chamber of deputies yesterday decided to abolish secrecy when voting
on whether to waive the immunity of members involved in cases of corruption
and the illicit financing of political parties.
This represented a hurried attempt to mollify public opinion, outraged by
the way parliament last Thursday blocked four of six requests by Milan
magistrates for Mr Bettino Craxi, former Socialist leader, to face
corruption charges.
In demonstrations in Italy's main cities, protesters claimed immunity was
being abused to protect parliamentarians like Mr Craxi. The outcome of the
vote led the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), and the
Greens to withdraw their four ministers from the Ciampi government within
ten hours of it being formed. Only yesterday were four new ministers sworn
in.
The chamber was also willing to act quickly because a majority of the
deputies were convinced that in the Craxi vote secrecy was itself abused.
Members of the opposition like the populist Lombard League, the hardline
communist group, Reconstructed Communism, and the Network (La Rete) are
believed to have voted to preserve Mr Craxi's immunity - with the aim of
embarrassing the government.
The decision coincided with the late night agreement on Tuesday by the
Socialist Party not to contest magistrates' requests for its deputies to be
investigated.
In an attempt to improve its image, the party also agreed that members under
investigation, especially the 54 in parliament and the main party apparatus,
should be suspended. The party, which has a new leader, Mr Giorgio
Benvenuto, is also planning a new name and symbol.

FT  06 MAY 93 / EC states risk action on passport checks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ACTION will be taken against member states which resist the abolition of
passport checks on people travelling within the EC, the European Commission
warned yesterday.
Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the EC internal market commissioner, said the
Commission had not changed its tough line on border controls, in spite of
recent comments by the new French government suggesting that the conditions
for lifting internal controls on people will not be met before the end of
this year.
The Community missed the January 1, 1993 deadline for lifting controls. Mr
Vanni d'Archirafi has set a new deadline of December 1 for the nine
continental European countries which have signed the Schengen free-travel
agreement, and has indicated that other countries - Britain, Denmark and
Ireland - will have to follow suit by the end of the year.
Yesterday, celebrating 100 days of the new internal market, the commissioner
said if member states could not demonstrate they were making 'constant
progress' towards that objective, then they might have to be encouraged by
Commission legislation, or even legal action, in the second half of the
year.
Mr Vanni d'Archirafi said he thought the balance-sheet for the rest of the
single market - aimed at ensuring the free movement of goods, services,
capital and people across the 12 member states - was 'fairly positive,'
although he said there still appeared to be some resistance to
liberalisation of the EC's lucrative public procurement market.
The commissioner, who also demonstrated the EC's computerised database on
the single market, said one key to making the market work was distributing
more information about the opportunities available.
The European Commission has yet to act on promises to speed up the most
difficult EC competition inquiries, officials admitted yesterday.
A new accelerated procedure, modelled on the strict deadlines for EC merger
investigations, has been put into effect for joint ventures, and a backlog
of ageing competition dossiers is being cleared.
But the EC competition directorate has taken advantage of a change of
commissioner to delay the imposition of new deadlines in all other cases.
Sir Leon Brittan, who gave up the competition portfolio in January, promised
faster decisions for all complaints from April 1. Sir Leon made the
commitment in a valedictory speech on the future of EC competition policy
last December.
The Commission's reluctance to speed up procedure will disappoint many
competition lawyers, who are frustrated by the sluggishness of some
inquiries into alleged cartels and illegal dominance of the EC market.

HUNGARY has reached a 'gentleman's agreement' with the International
Monetary Fund which clears the way for a new credit facility and the
country's return to financial respectability, writes Nicholas Denton in
Budapest.
Under the accord, agreed in Washington this week, Hungary promised to bring
the country's wayward public-sector deficit down from more than 7 per cent
of gross domestic product in 1992 to 5.5 per cent next year.
The Hungarian authorities plan a package of tax increases and spending cuts.
Some will come into effect this year but most will bite only in 1994.
Government officials were confident the measures would pass through
parliament this month, allowing the formal signing of the accord with the
Fund afterwards.
In return the IMF will disburse a credit of SDR560m (Pounds 251m) over this
year and next.

FT  06 MAY 93 / US and western allies fail to resolve their differences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and its western allies yesterday were still at odds over what action
to take if the Bosnian Serb assembly failed to give clear endorsement to the
Vance-Owen peace plan, Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, admitted.
While not ruling out some kind of military action such as air strikes
against Bosnian Serb supply lines, Mr Hurd said that talks last weekend with
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, had not resolved which
particular option should be chosen.
Mr Hurd, who was answering questions by members of the Commons Foreign
Affairs Committee, referred in particular to reservations by Britain and
other countries about the preferred US option to lift the UN embargo on arms
deliveries to Bosnia. Such a step 'runs the risk of inflaming the fighting
and spreading the war,' he said.
Britain and France, main contributors of troops to the UN peacekeeping
operation in the former Yugoslavia, have almost identical positions on the
subject, as became clear in talks in London on Tuesday between their two
prime ministers, Mr John Major and Mr Edouard Balladur.
Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, said yesterday that, while military
force might have to be used against the Bosnian Serbs if their parliament
failed to give unequivocal approval to the peace plan, a decision to do so
could only be taken by the UN Security Council after further consultations
between the main powers concerned.
Mr Juppe also told the weekly meeting of the French cabinet that US-French
differences over the command of future peacekeeping forces and the possible
lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia had surfaced during talks in Paris on
Tuesday with Mr Christopher.
The US had 'clearly indicated' it would ask for the lifting of the arms
embargo if the peace agreement was not ratified by the Bosnian Serb
assembly, a government spokesman quoted Mr Juppe as telling the cabinet. 'As
far as this solution goes, France has its reservations.'
Mr Hurd strongly denied reports that international forces might be sent into
Bosnia to impose the peace plan as long as the fighting continued and the
plan had not been endorsed by the Bosnian Serbs. 'We certainly would not be
putting in troops to push Serb troops out of areas which they have to vacate
under the Vance-Owen plan,' Mr Hurd said.
This categorically contradicted a statement in Brussels yesterday by Lord
Owen, one of the international mediators, that a peacekeeping force must be
prepared to fight, if necessary, to make the warring parties withdraw their
troops.
Mr Hurd, however, said the UN - including British - troops would do no more
than monitor the withdrawal of the warring parties' forces to their
designated areas, but would not be deployed until it was clear that the
withdrawal was under way.
He emphasised the government had not yet made a decision on Britain's
contribution and reports that a 60,000-strong UN peacekeeping force would
include 10,000 British troops were no more than 'speculative.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THROUGHOUT the long build-up to a still imponderable denouement in Bosnia
President Bill Clinton has always promised maximum consultation with
Congress and a full justification of whatever actions the US undertook to
the American public.
Yesterday he provided the barest glimmer of the latter. Welcoming home US
troops from their humanitarian mission in Somalia, he spoke of 'other
missions that lie ahead,' and of a world that 'has not seen the end of
evil."
He went on: 'Some will ask why we must so often be the one to lead. Well, of
course, we cannot be the world's policeman, but we are, and must continue to
be, the world's leader. That is the job of the United States of America.'
But the word Bosnia never passed his lips. It may have been understandable
that it did not do so, for no decision had been taken by the Bosnian Serb
'parliament' as he spoke.
But of all the options still open to him two are particularly fraught. There
remains the very good chance that within days President Clinton will either
be authorising the dispatch of a substantial 20,000 plus US military
contingent to keep the new peace in Bosnia or air strikes against Serb
installations. His country will want to know why the US deems its vital
interests are so much at stake for a president schooled by opposition to the
Vietnam War.
As Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia put it yesterday: the president has 'to
identify our strategic interests. He has to identify our humanitarian
interests. And he has to express clear goals that may be tied to military
action."
Mr Clinton knows the case can be more easily made if US action is part of a
UN operation and with the participation of its allies and Russia. In spite
of reports from the current mission to Europe by Mr Warren Christopher, the
secretary of state, of disagreements between the US and its allies, it is
assumed that, in the crunch, this can be obtained. Yesterday's commitment by
Russia to contribute to peacekeeping is seen as very helpful.
Indeed, if Europe, already heavily criticised in the US for ducking the
Bosnian problem, were to sit on its hands, or to continue to resist the
alternative option of lifting the arms embargo, then Mr Clinton would
probably face an impossible domestic selling job.
He may even conclude it is not worth attempting because the constituency in
favour of unilateral US action is undoubtedly in the minority.
Further uncertainty surrounds the speed at which either a UN peacekeeping
force or offensive action could be put into effect. This delay may buy Mr
Clinton some time to persuade his domestic audiences he is doing the right
thing but not much, but the appearance of indecision might be harmful.
The most likely course for the president would be more than one national
televised address from the Oval Office together with excursions outside
Washington, plus mass deployment of senior officials to make the case to
various audiences.
But this process, in turn, will invite criticism on a very grand scale, with
the almost certain consequence that Mr Clinton will be accused of forgetting
why he was elected in the first place - to put the domestic economy back on
the rails.

AN INTERNATIONAL tribunal to judge war crimes committed since 1991 in former
Yugoslavia should be set up under the mandatory enforcement procedures of
the UN Security Council, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary general,
proposed yesterday.
In a written report to the Council, which agreed in February to establish
the court, he said a resolution under Chapter VII of the UN Charter would
become 'immediately effective' and all states then would be obliged to take
necessary action.
The court would comprise 11 judges and sit at The Hague in the Netherlands,
where the International Court of Justice is located.
The US has already prepared a list of suspected Yugoslav war criminals. This
includes Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader who last Sunday
initialled the Vance-Owen peace plan. The release of Mr Boutros Ghali's
recommendations on the day that the Bosnian Serb 'parliament' was
considering whether to ratify acceptance apparently was only a coincidence.
Responding to reservations voiced by some UN members about the propriety of
creating a tribunal, the secretary general said the court was 'legally
justified.' The Security Council had already determined that widespread
violations of humanitarian law in former Yugoslavia threatened international
peace and security.
Mr Boutros Ghali, himself an international legal authority, offered the
draft of a 34-article statute for the court, one article of which would
presume the innocence of the accused, promised speedy trial and no
compulsion to self-incrimination.
The court should not be empowered to impose the death penalty and terms of
imprisonment should be based on the general practice of sentencing by
Yugoslav courts.
Among the offences that should be tried are genocide and complicity in
genocide - a clear reference to the ethnic cleansing campaign in Bosnia
which has shocked the world and helped to fuel demands for UN military
measures. Charges of murder, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment,
torture, rape, political, racial and religious persecution as well as 'other
inhumane acts' should be dealt with by the court, the Secretary General
proposed.

THE European Commission yesterday took steps to overturn its secretive
policy on access to information, suggesting that most EC documents should be
available to the public on demand.
The move is part of the 'openness policy' through which the Community is
trying to rebuild its credibility with European citizens.
Foreign ministers of the Twelve will consider the proposals on Monday. They
are likely to be refined before endorsement by EC heads of government at the
Copenhagen summit on June 21-22.
The proposals would turn EC policy on access to documents on its head.
Although the Commission itself is a relatively permeable institution, the
formal position until now, as one Dutch official put it, is that 'it's all
secret unless we decide it isn't'
Under the new dispensation, all documents would be public unless their
diffusion prejudiced privacy, commercial confidentiality, national security
or monetary stability.
Between now and the Copenhagen summit there is likely to be considerable
scrapping over grey areas of confidentiality.
Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the commissioner behind the plan, for instance,
wants the working documents of the EC institutions - which reveal thinking
on policy as it germinates - made public. Some member states and
commissioners are bound to resist this.
The proposal would bring EC institutions into line with the law in the
Netherlands, France, Greece and, Denmark.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Italian deputies end secret voting in scandal cases
</HEADLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S chamber of deputies yesterday decided to abolish secrecy when voting
on whether to waive the immunity of members involved in cases of corruption
and the illicit financing of political parties.
This represented a hurried attempt to mollify public opinion, outraged by
the way parliament last Thursday blocked four of six requests by Milan
magistrates for Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, to face
charges of corruption.
In demonstrations in Italy's main cities, protesters claimed immunity was
being abused to protect parliamentarians like Mr Craxi. The outcome of the
vote led the former communist, Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), and the
Greens to withdraw their four ministers from the Ciampi government within
ten hours of it being formed. Only yesterday were four new ministers, all
technicians, sworn in.
Many deputies were convinced that in the Craxi vote secrecy was itself
abused. Members of the opposition like the populist Lombard League, the
hardline communist group, Reconstructed Communism, and the Network (La Rete)
are believed to have voted to preserve Mr Craxi's immunity - with the aim of
embarrassing the government.
The decision coincided with the late night agreement on Tuesday by the
Socialist Party not to contest magistrates' requests for its deputies to be
investigated.
In an attempt to improve its image, the party also agreed that members under
investigation, especially the 54 in parliament and the main party apparatus,
should be suspended. The party, which has a new leader, Mr Giorgio
Benvenuto, is also planning a new name and symbol.
The corruption issue yesterday looked like implicating more deeply the
former Italian Communist Party (PCI). Milan magistrates leaked evidence that
Mr Giulio Caporali, a former board member on the state railways,
representing the Communists, had ensured funds went to the party via
railways contracts handed out to 10 groups belonging to the PCI's
co-operative movement.
The funds were used, he alleged, to plug the debts of L'Unita, the PCI daily
and cover conference expenses. Mr Caporali was expelled from the PCI in 1988
after a scandal over the purchase of linen for sleeper coaches.
Railway contracts are emerging as a major new line of enquiry by Milan
magistrates.
Another is contracts in the state telephone system. In the past four days
one senior former executive in Asst, the telephone service, and an official
in the tele-communications ministry have been arrested.
Mr Giuseppe Parrella, former managing director of Asst, is being questioned
about alleged kickbacks on L2,500bn (Pounds 1.06bn) of telecom orders
involving major domestic and multinational companies between 1987 and 1991.

director-general

<TEXT>
MR Peter Sutherland, chairman of Allied Irish Banks, yesterday confirmed
that he was a candidate to succeed Mr Arthur Dunkel who retires as
director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade at the end of
June.
Trade officials in Geneva believe that Mr Sutherland, sponsored by the
European Community and with American support, is likely to secure the
acceptance of Gatt's 114 members to take over as head of the world trade
body. However, at least two other candidates are in the ring.
Mr Sutherland told Irish state radio he was now 'willing, in the event of
being acceptable, to take the job'.
The 47-year-old Irishman, who was EC competition commissioner between 1985
and 1989, was initially reluctant to be considered for the post, citing
family reasons.
He said yesterday he had changed his mind after being telephoned by Mr
Jacques Delors, European Commission president.
Mr Sutherland's name has been formally proposed by the European Community in
a letter to Mr Balkrishan Zutshi, India's Gatt ambassador, who is in charge
of consulting Gatt members on Mr Dunkel's replacement.
Mr Julio Lacarte Muro, formerly Uruguay's ambassador to Gatt, and Mr Luis
Fernando Jaramillo, former foreign minister of Colombia, are also declared
candidates.
Geneva diplomats said yesterday that Mr Zutshi was hoping for a consensus by
the next meeting of Gatt's governing council on May 12. However, an
extraordinary meeting of Gatt members will be needed, probably in June, to
formally appoint the next director general.
Mr Sutherland said yesterday that the Gatt job was 'an opportunity to do
something very worthwhile,' in particular in bringing about a Uruguay Round
agreement.
The global trade talks, more than two years overdue, are supposed to finish
by the end of this year, when the US administration's proposed negotiating
authority expires.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Milosevic turns necessity into a virtue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PALE, BOSNIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEPUTIES assembled at the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament yesterday to
debate the international peace plan for the country appeared more annoyed
than awed by the arrival of their patrons Serbia's President Slobodan
Milosevic and his Yugoslav counterparts at their mountain stronghold of
Pale.
The Bosnian Serb leadership stood on the terrace of the Heavenly Valley
Hotel waiting for the long motorcade of sleek black Mercedes limousines to
snake up Mount Jahorina. The soldiers chanted a song of resistance against
the Turks set to an American square-bashing tune.
Just a few miles away, Serb artillery trained on Sarajevo over the past year
has all but destroyed the Bosnian capital.
A crowd watched as Mr Milosevic, who has newly donned the mantle of
international mediator, and his closest international ally, Mr Constantine
Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, reviewed the Bosnian Serb guard of
honour.
Mr Radoslav Brdjanin, a hardline deputy from Banja Luka, north west Bosnia,
remarked: 'They do not understand we are fighting their battle for them. We
are defending Belgrade, when our soldiers die on the frontlines in
Grbavica,' he said in reference to a Serb-held suburb of Sarajevo, the
Bosnian capital.
Mr Milosevic called on the assembly to back the international plan to divide
Bosnia into 10 provinces along ethnic lines. 'The decision for peace has no
alternative because it is in the interests of Bosnian Serbs and Serbs in
general,' he said.
Mr Dobrica Cosic, the Yugoslav president, warned Bosnian Serb deputies that
they faced a stark choice between a military defeat or achieving their
political aims in peacetime.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, echoed his patrons from
Belgrade and sheepishly toned down his message of defiance.
Early in the day deputies admitted the presence of their influential guests
might sway the decision on the peace plan. Even Mr Karadzic, who recommended
the plan, described it as a catastrophe. But rather than show deference to
their weighty guests, they mainly complained about the plan which requires
Serb forces to give back nearly half the territory they currently control.
'It is easy for Milosevic to call on us to return our land. Bosnian Serbs
have died defending it,' said a member of the government speaking on
condition of anonymity.
He described how Mr Milosevic had 'used the Bosnian Serbs to unite Serb
territories and under international pressure had abandoned his plans'.
One way or the other Mr Milosevic will try to turn the outcome into a
personal victory. In less than a month he has been transformed into a
peacemaker. In a Byzantine twist, the west, which accuses him of being the
one person most responsible for the war in Bosnia, has come to rely on him
as the emissary of peace in Bosnia. He appeared to be the only one who could
bring the deputies to heel.
Since the Bosnian Serbs rejected the plan last Monday despite Mr Milosevic's
last minute intervention, he reportedly cajoled them and threatened to cut
off their supply lines if they refused to back the peace plan.
Arriving with Mr Mitsotakis, he gave the appearance of a statesman dwarfing
the worn and weary Bosnian Serb leaders. He has once again shown his
chameleon-like ability to manipulate a crisis to his advantage. But Mr
Milosevic appeared ready to risk widening the rift between Serbs on one side
of the frontier and the other.
Mr Milosevic, since he came to power in 1987, riding a wave of Serb
nationalism, has billed himself as the defender of all Serbs. But he has
never tolerated dissent from his proteges, even from Serbs outside of
Serbia, the very people he has claimed to protect.
'I thought he was a great fighter for Serbia. Now, I see he does not care
and is willing to have us bombed,' said the official of Srpska Republika,
the self-styled Serb state which covers some 70 per cent of Bosnia.
In 1992 Mr Milosevic orchestrated the ousting of Mr Milan Babic, a rebel
leader from Croatia who opposed the despatch of UN peacekeepers to Krajina,
Serb-held territory in Croatia. This time, it has not been so easy. Too much
blood has been spilt to effect a simple change of leadership to get approval
for the plan.
Mr Cosic yesterday put it simply: Yugoslavia could no longer afford to fight
the war. If need be, Mr Milosevic will not hesitate to jettison the Bosnian
Serbs if they prove too heavy a burden for Serbia and Montenegro, already
under tight sanctions and under threat of military intervention.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Direct Line may apply for its own full banking licence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECT LINE, the rapidly growing telephone insurance company owned by the
Royal Bank of Scotland, may apply for a full banking licence so that it can
provide a broad range of financial services, including savings accounts.
The plan was disclosed yesterday as Direct Line reported a trebling of
pre-tax profits to Pounds 15m in the six months to March 31. It helped raise
Royal Bank's pre-tax profits to Pounds 91.6m in the first half of its
financial year.
Direct Line, which is poised to become the UK's biggest motor insurer, is
also preparing an assault on the home insurance market in the autumn and
hopes to launch a telephone-based loans operation in September.
The group is also planning subsequently to sell mortgages, life insurance
and deposit accounts. In order for Direct Line to offer savings accounts,
the Bank of England would have to grant the subsidiary its own banking
licence.
Although Royal Bank insists there is no conflict between Direct Line and
other operations, such as branch and telephone banking, an application for a
separate banking licence may raise further questions about the relationship.
Mr Peter Wood, Direct Line's chief executive, said the company was in the
process of developing financial products 'that offer the Direct Line brand
values'.
He said that in the longer term, it could even diversify into the travel
agency business.
Mr Wood is expected to earn at least Pounds 10m this year after being paid
Pounds 6m last year. His remuneration package, negotiated when he sold 25
per cent of the company to the RBS in 1988, is linked to the rate of Direct
Line's asset growth.
Mr Wood said Royal Bank of Scotland could float Direct Line on the stock
market if the bank's share price failed to reflect the value of its rapidly
growing insurance subsidiary.
Mr George Mathewson, Royal Bank's chief executive said that a flotation was
'not currently part of our plan'. He expected Direct Line and Royal Bank's
other insurance subsidiary eventually to contribute over 20 per cent of
earnings.
Direct Line's interim figures, released yesterday, show strong growth.
Premium income over the six months doubled to Pounds 160.6m (Pounds 82.7m),
and the number of motor policyholders rose from 500,000 at the end of March
last year to 903,500 this year.
The company expects to insure at least 1.2m of the 18m motorists holding
insurance by the end of the year.
At the moment, 229,000 households buy insurance from Direct Line, following
26 per cent growth in the last six months.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Nadir's flight wrecks fraud case: Britain unlikely to secure
fugitive businessman's return from northern Cyprus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KYRENIA, NORTHERN CYPRUS,, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER high-profile British fraud prosecution appeared in ruins yesterday
as attempts to secure the return of the fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir
from the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus seemed set to
fail.
Mr Nadir's flight to Cyprus on Tuesday night prompted instant recriminations
in the UK.
The Serious Fraud Office, which had led the fraud investigation after the
collapse of Polly Peck International, Mr Nadir's fruit and electronics
group, took the unusual step of issuing a formal statement, saying it had
argued strongly for Mr Nadir to be kept in custody because it had feared he
would abscond.
Bankers, owed more than Pounds 1bn following the collapse of Polly Peck,
also reacted with dismay. One banker on the Polly Peck creditors committee
said: 'We always thought he would leave, but what can you do about it? You
can't keep him in prison for years (awaiting trial).'
One reason Mr Nadir may have decided to leave Britain is because he could
have faced imprisonment for failing to comply with court orders. Mr Neil
Cooper of accountants Robson Rhodes, who is trustee in bankruptcy to Mr
Nadir, said there were only a few days left for Mr Nadir to comply with a
series of orders requiring him to give details of transactions and the
location of assets.
Last night, Lord Mackay, the UK attorney-general, was expected to meet Mr
Rauf Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader, in Northern Cyprus to discuss Mr
Nadir's case.
Mr David Dain, UK high commissioner in Cyprus, earlier crossed the green
line dividing the Turkish north from the rest of the island to appeal to the
authorities to send the businessman back. The request was turned down. The
UK has no extradition agreement with Northern Cyprus.
Mr Nadir, who faced 13 charges of theft and false accounting at Polly Peck
involving about Pounds 34m, was due to stand trial in September.
He had surrendered his British and Turkish passports to police and had
personally put up Pounds 2m of his record Pounds 3.5m bail.
Mr Nadir's solicitors in London said last night he had been unwell and 'very
concerned about various aspects of the judicial process' and whether he
would have time to prepare his defence.
Mr Ramadan Guney, the Turkish businessman who put up a Pounds 1m surety for
Mr Nadir, yesterday said he met Mr Nadir on Monday. He had given no
indication that he intended to flee.
Mr Guney, speaking at his Turkish music shop in north London, denied any
involvement in the flight.
His lawyer, Mr Rick Sherman, said his client had a very great shock. Mr
Guney was now 'not in good health'.
Mr Sherman said that Mr Guney had held regular meetings with Mr Nadir and at
all times had been assured by Mr Nadir that he would attend his trial.
Asked if he expected his money to be recovered, Mr Guney said that was a
matter for the court. However, he denied that he would be left bankrupt or
ruined by the affair, and refused to comment on Mr Nadir's behaviour.
Mr Nadir spent his first day in more than two years on Turkish Cypriot soil
behind closed doors, together with his family.
After meeting Mr Nadir yesterday morning, Mr Mentes Aziz, his lawyer, said:
'He is here to stay.' Mr Aziz added that Mr Nadir was in 'good spirits'.
However, he expressed some surprise at Mr Nadir's sudden arrival on the
island: 'I saw him only 10 days ago in the UK and he seemed so determined to
fight his case in the courts.'
Mr Mehmet Ali Akpinar, managing editor of Mr Nadir's Turkish language daily
newspaper, Kibris, said: 'He is back in his country and he is very happy to
come back to his people. He may make a very substantial statement next
week.'
Mr Akpinar was among a wel-coming party which raced to greet Mr Nadir at the
VIP lounge at Ercan airport with members of his family and local
politicians.
The private twin-engine jet touched down at 10.25pm. The aircraft was
understood to have been piloted by two Britons.
Mr Denktash later explained his reasons for turning down the British request
for extradition: 'Legally we cannot do it because he is protected under our
constitution. We cannot apprehend him because he has committed no crime in
Cyprus.'
Mr Denktash said there was no problem between the state and Mr Nadir. The
issue, he said, had to be decided by the government. 'Any decision must come
from the government. They have to make clear what they will do . . . Asil
Nadir is our citizen and there is no country in the world where it is not a
government's duty to protect its citizens.'
Police chief Ali Cetin Karahan said that Mr Nadir was 'not a criminal before
our law and there is no case against him here'.
Mr Nadir's departure to Cyprus and his breach of bail will be discussed in
front of a judge at the Old Bailey tomorrow.
A warrant for his arrest will amost certainly be issued, though serving it
will be impossible while he remains in Northern Cyprus.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Serbs seek to impose conditions on Bosnian peace plan: You
cannot oppose and fight the entire world, warns Greek premier

THE BOSNIAN Serb assembly was last night moving towards the adoption of a
document listing nine conditions for the acceptance of the international
peace plan on Bosnia.
A vote for such a document would almost certainly be viewed by the US and
its western allies as a rejection of the plan, brokered by Mr Cyrus Vance
and Lord Owen, the UN and European Community mediators.
As the 82 deputies of the self-styled parliament continued their debate into
the early hours of the morning, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and
President Dobrica Cosic of the rump Yugoslavia made a dramatic appeal to the
deputies to adopt the plan without qualifications. 'We can't help you any
more,' they said, warning that the assembly's intended action would provoke
military intervention.
Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, prime minister of Greece, a traditional ally of
Orthodox Serbia, warned the delegates: 'You cannot oppose and fight the
entire world.'
Mr Dragan Kalinic, health minister of the self-proclaimed Serb Republic in
Bosnia, said the parliament meeting in the mountain stronghold of Pale near
Sarajevo, 'would vote 'yes' to the plan but with conditions'.
These were contained in a draft document to be voted on by the assembly and
included the abolition of international sanctions against Yugoslavia within
three weeks as well as changes in the Vance-Owen map which would link Serb
provinces of Bosnia.
At the vital session of the Bosnian Serb parliament, bitter divisions
emerged over whether to accept the plan or reject it and face possible
punitive air strikes from the US and its allies.
Diplomatic observers believed that most of the Bosnian Serb conditions, if
confirmed, would be rejected by the international community. The US, Britain
and France have all stressed that sanctions must remain in place until it
was absolutely clear that the Bosnian Serbs were implementing the peace plan
as agreed.
Moreover, the international mediators, who have proposed dividing Bosnia
into 10 semi-autonomous provinces, have always been careful to avoid drawing
a map which would enable the Bosnian Serbs to consolidate their territory
and declare a separate state. The Bosnian Serbs, on the other hand, have
never concealed their long-term aim of subsuming such a state in a Greater
Serbia.
Other conditions contained in the document included a land swap with the
Croats, the right of Serb minorities in Croat and Moslem provinces to vote
on whether they should join neighbouring Serb provinces, and the provision
that 50 per cent of UN troops deployed along confrontation lines come from
Orthodox countries.
Meanwhile, the US and Russia yesterday glossed over their differences on
Bosnia to present a united front after talks in Moscow between Mr Warren
Christopher, the US secretary of state, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, his Russian
opposite number.
The two sides issued a bullish joint statement, in which they said they were
both prepared to commit 'appropriate' military forces to a peacekeeping
operation.

FT  06 MAY 93 / Threat of defeat forces government retreat on treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ignominious climbdown by the government over the Maastricht treaty's
social chapter last night set the stage for a tortuous legal battle over
British ratification of the treaty.
Facing certain defeat in the Commons at the hands of an alliance of
opposition parties and Tory Euro-sceptics, the government accepted an
amendment which will delete from British law any reference to the treaty's
social provisions.
That left Mr John Major, who underlined again his determination to press
ahead with ratification, facing two potential legal challenges.
One is promised by the Tory Euro-sceptics, who hope to persuade the courts
that the amendment has undercut the legal basis for ratification of the
treaty. Another is expected from trade unions which want to force the
government to abandon its opt-out from the social chapter.
The embarrassing retreat came on the eve of today's Newbury by-election,
where the Conservative majority of 12,357 is under serious threat from the
Liberal Democrats. The government is braced for large losses in simultaneous
county council elections.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, sought to play down the implication of
the Maastricht decision by insisting the retreat would affect neither
ratification of the treaty nor the status of Britain's social chapter
opt-out.
In a skilful and confident Commons performance which helped to minimise the
government's public humiliation, Mr Hurd told MPs that the amendment was
'tiresome and undesirable but in practice irrelevant'. The fact that the
social chapter and the accompanying British opt-out would not now be
incorporated into domestic law would not remove them from the treaty.
The attorney-general has advised the government that it can press ahead with
the ratification process. But Mr Hurd conceded that a legal challenge, which
could be mounted by the Eurosceptics within weeks, might delay ratification
of the treaty. Ministers were admitting privately that the amendment will
prolong the government's political agony over Maastricht.
Mr Major, who had hoped to draw a line under the battle before the summer
parliamentary recess, was said to have been intensely annoyed by the
decision of Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, to agree a debate on the
amendment.
Later today Lady Thatcher is expected to add to his embarrassment by
renewing publicly her call for a referendum on the treaty. She is committed
to step up up that campaign when the Maastricht bill moves to the House of
Lords early next month.
For Labour, Mr Jack Cunningham, the shadow foreign secretary, insisted that
the opposition's aim was to 'secure the benefits of the social chapter for
the people of Britain'.
But the opposition's allies among the Tory Eurosceptics took an entirely
different tack. They claimed that they now had a powerful legal lever with
which to undermine the basis of parliament's ratification.

THE US and Russia yesterday glossed over their differences on Bosnia to
present a show of unity, as the Bosnian Serb parliament met behind closed
doors in its mountain headquarters of Pale to decide whether to endorse the
international peace plan.
The debate continued into the night, following an impassioned plea for the
plan's endorsement from Belgrade leaders, President Slobodan Milosevic of
Serbia and Mr Dobrica Cosic, president of the rump Yugoslavia.
'We cannot wage war until we commit suicide,' Mr Cosic said.
Even Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, who signed the agreement
in Athens last weekend under great international pressure, warned deputies
that 'enormous dangers hover over us' if they should reject the plan.
He added that the Bosnian Serbs could still attain their goals through
peaceful neg-otiation if they endorsed the plan.
After talks in Moscow between Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of
state, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, his Russian counterpart, the two sides issued
a bullish statement clearly designed to encourage a 'yes' vote in the
Bosnian Serb assembly.
The statement said both sides were prepared to commit 'appropriate' military
forces to a peacekeeping operation, if the Bosnian Serbs accepted the peace
plan, brokered by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen.
However, like Britain and France during previous stops made by Mr
Christopher on his current tour, Russia did not commit itself to specific
military measures if the Bosnian Serb assembly rejected the peace plan for
the third time.
'If it is not accepted and implemented, Russia and the US will immediately
resume discussion of new, tougher measures. No measures are prejudged or
excluded from consideration,' the statement said.
Although the western allies and Russia are clearly keen to maintain the
pressure on the Bosnian Serbs, their reservations about lifting sanctions on
arms supplies to Bosnia or making selective air strikes would make it
difficult to reach a consensus taking on military action.
The US, has said it will not act unilaterally, even if the Pale assembly
rejects the peace plan. The differences over possible responses should the
plan be rejected are compounded by disagreements about the terms of
engagement for the 60,000 to 70,000-strong peacekeeping force destined for
Bosnia to oversee the implementation of the Vance-Owen plan and its command
structure.
Lord Owen, who visited Nato headquarters in Brussels yesterday, emphasised
that the Nato-led force had to be prepared to fight if necessary to enforce
the plan and that it should be deployed even if the Bosnian Serb assembly
does reject the plan.
That view has been categorically contested by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, who told the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee that 'we are not
envisaging the deployment of troops into a war.
'It is not their job to move in to enforce a plan. It is their job to
monitor its implementation,' he said.

KANOO, one of the Gulf's leading trade and shipping groups, yesterday signed
a groundbreaking agreement in Bahrain with Omega Investment, a South African
business consultancy, to encourage direct trade and investment between the
republic and the Gulf - signalling a shift away from the Gulf states'
enforcement of trade sanctions against Pretoria.
Both sides said they hoped the agreement would marry the Gulf states' hunger
for investment in high-technology manufacturing to South Africa's desire to
formalise overt trade ties with Middle Eastern countries. Trade has
previously been handled essentially through third parties.
Kanoo will act as Omega's sponsor in Bahrain but, according to Mr Michael
Parsons, general manager, will try to promote links between a range of Gulf
and South African companies. The agreement's first fruit will be mutual
trade and investment missions between Bahrain and the republic.
The deal is the first formal attempt to improve trade links between the two
regions, but caps growing interest from Bahrain in cultivating links with
South Africa. Gulf Air, the Bahrain-based Gulf airline, has in the past year
begun flights to Johannesburg, while Flight Star, a South African charter
airline, has won reciprocal rights to fly into Manama.
Mr Denis Worrall, director general of Omega and former South African
ambassador to Britain, said businessmen travelling with him on a 12-day
visit to Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Bahrain were encouraged by opportunities in
retailing, air conditioning manufacture and food processing. Petrochemical
exports are sure to dominate any expanded trade.

FT  05 MAY 93 / World Trade News: UK-India trade drive under way
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN Anglo-Indian initiative to step up trade, following the January visit to
India of Britain's Prime Minister John Major, will be launched in London
today.
During his Indian tour Mr Major and Mr P V Narasimha Rao, his Indian
counterpart, announced moves aimed at greater economic co-operation between
the two states.
Mr Major called on business communities in both countries to consider
measures, with the help of government, to improve two-way trade. He asked Mr
Robert Evans, chairman of British Gas, who was with the prime minister's
tour party, to head the new initiative.
Dr J J Irani, managing director of Tata Steel and president of the
Confederation of Indian Industry, is leading the Indian effort.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, whose department is
leading a drive to increase UK exports by promoting partnership between
government and industry, will attend today's launch of the Indo-British
Partnership Initiative.
Britain sells nearly Pounds 1bn (Dollars 1.54bn) worth of goods to India,
which has a small trade imbalance with the UK. New Delhi has committed
itself to a new era of trade liberalisation.
Since the visit, British Gas has acted as the UK catalyst - with the help of
the south-east Asia desk at the Department of Trade and Industry - to bring
together a number of 'patron' companies to spearhead the initiative.
Companies already signed up include British Aerospace, Cadbury Schweppes,
GEC Alsthom, Inchcape, National Power, Rolls-Royce and Unilever.
Representation will be at chief executive or senior level and member
companies will each contribute to running costs.
Members will be organised along industry sector lines and will form working
groups to analyse potential markets and ways to exploit them. The effort
will be regionally based, with local Department of Trade offices, chambers
of commerce and the Confederation of British Industry providing back-up.
Important sectors identified for examination include power generation,
telecommunications, food processing, banking and financial services, oil and
gas, engineering, textiles and healthcare.
The results of the work will be brought together and the prime ministers
will be given proposals for enhancing trade between the two countries early
next year.
A UK spokesman emphasised the initiative was intended primarily to assist
medium-sized and small companies without the necessary resources to tackle
the Indian market. 'The really big companies can look after themselves. The
intention is that other businesses should be able to use the muscle of big
companies to get into a market with huge potential.'

THE US requires better market access for its agricultural exports to the EC
in order to conclude a Uruguay Round deal, Mr Mike Espy, US agriculture
secretary, said yesterday.
Following meetings in Brussels with Mr Rene Steichen, EC farm commissioner,
and Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, Mr Espy said the issue of
market access was left 'largely unresolved' by last November's EC-US
breakthrough in Washington on farm trade.
The US agriculture secretary said the administration had no wish to reopen
the Washington agreement, which staved off a transatlantic trade war. But in
order to conclude an agreement under the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (Gatt) 'we need better market access,' he said. He would not be drawn
on whether the US was seeking a managed trade solution, guaranteeing it
market share, and merely said officials from both sides would be looking at
the issue of access.
He also said it was 'time-urgent' for the EC to implement the Washington
agreement on oilseeds, hinting that otherwise the powerful US soya industry
would press for the Dollars 1bn sanctions withdrawn last November to be
reinstated.
Mr Steichen emphasised that 'their interpretation is different from ours' on
market access. 'The US wants fixed markets now,' he added, pointing out that
the Uruguay Round final act mentioned only market 'opportunities'.
Senior Commission officials said it would be almost impossible to get EC
member states to agree on any guarantees for market access, beyond the
commitments already entered into under the Washington agreement and last
May's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy - already facing opposition
from France, the EC's main food producer and exporter.
Mr Steichen said the EC should adopt the oilseeds part of the Washington
agreement - separate from the Uruguay Round proper - by next month. He
emphasised that if France continued with its opposition, it could be
outvoted.
'This is not a question of unanimity. It will be settled by a qualified
majority' of member states, he said.
Mr Espy nevertheless said he would be reporting to President Bill Clinton
that a conclusion to the round was possible.

South Africa yesterday said it planned to reopen its diplomatic mission in

war, Reuter reports from Cape Town.
South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said the decision to send officials
back to the Luanda office was made following a meeting yesterday with the
former Angolan military commander, Gen Antonio dos Santos Franca.
The diplomats were withdrawn in November when fighting restarted after a
disputed election and the Angolan government accused Pretoria of resuming
support for Unita rebels.

THE United Nations yesterday launched an appeal to send 1.3m refugees back
to Mozambique in Africa's largest ever voluntary repatriation programme,
Reuter reports from Geneva.
The Dollars 203m sought from donor states will finance a three-year
programme, which officials hope to begin by late June.
The funds will be used by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) to buy food and seeds for planting, hire trucks to transfer the
refugees, and rebuild roads, bridges and schools. Up to Dollars 6m of the
funds will be used to remove landmines from the country.
A total of 1.8m refugees are believed to have fled civil war in Mozambique,
which caused Dollars 15bn in damage and left 3m dead before it ended last
year.
A peace accord and the easing of a severe drought have already encouraged
150,000 refugees to return, according to the UNHCR. The Geneva-based UN
agency expects to repatriate another 500,000 this year at a cost of Dollars
55m.
'The refugees are very eager to come home,' said Mr David Lambo, UNHCR
co-ordinator for southern Africa. 'They are waiting to see if the peace
situation is really going to stick. Mozambique is a key to bringing peace
and prosperity to the whole region,' he said.
Malawi is sheltering 1.1m of the 1.3m Mozambican refugees registered with
the UNHCR. Zimbabwe is home to 138,000, followed by Zambia, Swaziland and
Tanzania with 20,000-25,000 each.
In addition, South Africa is believed to have 250,000 unregistered
Mozambicans, Zimbabwe a further 100,000 and Tanzania another 50,000, the
agency said.
'The slow implementation of the peace process, the fragile economic
situation, the presence of millions of displaced and hungry people, and the
estimated 2m mines are among the major obstacles UNHCR faces,' it said.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Ukraine says Russia is violating CIS accord on nuclear
weapons: The struggle over control of parts of the former Soviet nuclear
arsenal and ownership of the Black Sea Fleet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE's defence minister has accused Russia of violating an agreement
among former Soviet republics on the control of nuclear weapons and of using
its forces stationed in his country to subvert Ukrainian independence.
In a rare interview, Gen Konstantyn Morozov said the nuclear weapons in
Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus were now under the direct control of
Russia's defence ministry rather than under the joint command of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, the ill-defined successor body to the
Soviet Union.
This, he said, was contrary to an agreement signed by members of the CIS in
Alma Ata, the Kazakh capital, when the USSR collapsed in December 1991.
Gen Morozov's comments mark a significant worsening in Ukrainian-Russian
relations. They raise the prospect of an intensifying struggle between Kiev
and Moscow both over control of parts of the former Soviet nuclear arsenal
and over the ownership and location of the Black Sea Fleet, which have been
in dispute for nearly two years.
The tenor of his comments also confirms that Ukraine is becoming
increasingly unwilling to give up the 176 inter-continental ballistic
missiles and nuclear-armed strategic bombers on its territory while its
conflict with Russia is unresolved.
Ukraine's delay in ratifying the Start 1 strategic arms limitation treaty
and in acceding to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has soured its
relations with the west and threatens to upset the entire international
disarmament process.
'Currently the Russian ministry of defence controls all the nuclear weapons
in all the former Soviet republics,' said Gen Morozov.
'We are the only republic that is sticking by the CIS agreement.'
The defence minister said this arrangement was plainly unsatisfactory and
that western security would be better served if Ukraine had the practical
capacity to block the use of nuclear weapons on its soil, rather than the
purely political veto it is permitted under its accord with Russia.
'For a long time these weapons have been aimed at the US. In my view it
would thus be convenient for the world if Ukraine had technical control over
the non-use of these weapons,' he said. It would be 'technically possible,'
he added, for Ukraine to acquire such capacity unilaterally, although it had
no current intention of doing so.
President Leonid Kravchuk has consistently vowed that Ukraine will ratify
Start 1 and accede to the NPT as a non-nuclear state. But parliament has yet
to hold a formal debate on these issues, and pro-nuclear sentiment is
growing as Ukraine comes under increasing pressure from the west and Russia.
The Russian parliament insists it will not ratify the Start 2 arms control
accord signed by Presidents George Bush and Boris Yeltsin in January until
Ukraine fulfils its commitments.
On the Black Sea Fleet, Gen Morozov said negotiations were going 'very
badly'.
He accused Russia of using the fleet, stationed in Sebastopol in Crimea, to
siphon off Ukrainian assets and politically to destabilise the region, to
which Russia has asserted territorial claims.
'By politicising the Black Sea Fleet issue, it (Russia) is making the
situation in the entire Crimean peninsula more acute,' he said. 'It is my
view that Russia is trying to use its presence in Crimea to exert pressure
on the government in Kiev over Ukrainian independence.'
Gen Morozov said if Russia would not agree rapidly to a division of the
fleet, then he would demand that Moscow remove it in its entirety from
Ukraine.
'If Russia insists on maintaining a presence in Sebastopol, Ukraine cannot
accept this position,' he said. 'I will demand the withdrawal of all ships
of the Black Sea Fleet as a foreign army, and we will build our own fleet,
although this would be a great loss. We cannot give part of our territory to
another power under any circumstances.'

TURKISH prime minister Suleyman Demirel yesterday formally announced that he
would stand as a presidential candidate in the first parliamentary ballot
due on May 8, writes John Murray Brown from Istanbul.
The main opposition Motherland party (Anap) said it would announce its
presidential candidate today.
If Mr Demirel is elected, his True Path party, DYP, which is the largest
party in parliament, would have to choose a new leader within 45 days.
In the interim period, Mr Erdal Inonu, the leader of the SHP, the
coalition's junior partner, would be likely to take over.

<TEXT>
THE CZECH government should do more to help foster companies'
competitiveness, rather than focus primarily on macro-economic stability,
the Czech Employers Confederation says.
Mr Rudolf Baranek, the confederation's chairman, says companies face growing
problems because of a decline in exports, poor production structures and
marketing.
The end of the currency union with Slovakia, together with import
restrictions into the EC, have also exacerbated their difficulties.
Employers are worried, too, by the rapid growth of wages, which they say
outstrips improvements in productivity.
The National Bank of Slovakia revalued the Slovak crown by 3 per cent
against the clearing Ecu set up to regulate trade with the Czech Republic.

Markus Wolf, former head of the East German spy apparatus, is surrounded by
journalists yesterday as he arrives at a Dusseldorf court building to stand
trial for alleged treason, espionage and bribery.
Mr Wolf later rejected the charges as the potentially-explosive trial opened
in a small basement room of the North Rhine Westphalia court, writes Ariane
Genillard in Dusseldorf.
The man who for three decades masterminded one of the most successful spy
networks of the cold war era, is accused of treason against West Germany and
of corrupting West German officials.
But in a well-crafted speech, Mr Wolf argued that the courts in West Germany
could not judge actions committed under the laws of a then East Germany,
which was a sovereign state.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Press will benefit from privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH state companies due for sale will have to place 'at least half' their
privatisation publicity budgets with the press, to boost newspapers' falling
advertising revenues.
This commitment was made to press proprietors yesterday by Mr Alain
Carignon, the new communications minister, who also promised a FFr200m
(Dollars 37m) 'support fund' to prevent certain ailing publications from
disappearing. These include the Quotidien de Paris, which braved a national
strike last week only to warn its readers it was about to go bankrupt, and
l'Humanite, the Communist party newspaper.
Asked about the irony of a conservative government saving a Communist paper,
Mr Carignon's spokeswoman said yesterday: 'We need to find out what's going
in that section of opinion.'
The conservatives' last sell-off of companies in 1987 proved a boon for the
press, which received 63 per cent of the privatisation advertisements. But
the share of ordinary publicity going to newspapers fell to 51 per cent last
year. Economic recession and competition from television have caused press
advertising revenue to fall by a third in the past two years.
Last year the Socialist government also stopped newspapers from carrying
tobacco and alcohol advertisements. Mr Carignon said he would honour this
law.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE city government of Naples, blighted by a widening corruption scandal,
has declared itself bankrupt with an estimated Dollars 1.4bn in debts,
Reuter reports from Naples.
Following a proposal by Mr Nicola Mancino, interior minister, Italian
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro is to appoint a commission to run the city's
finances, after the southern port city's council voted to declare itself
bankrupt.
Investigators have claimed that city councillors from several parties,
including the Christian Democrats and Socialists, financed their electoral
campaigns with kickbacks on public works contracts for the World Cup soccer
finals in 1990.
A dozen members of the city council are under investigation in the scandal.
Police yesterday said they had arrested Mr Ferdinando Clemente, a former
president of the local regional council, who is accused of extortion.
Nearly half the city's debt is expected to be covered by the central
government. The council hopes to recover the rest by various means,
including an appeal to the Napoli soccer club to pay an estimated Dollars
13.6m in rent arrears for its stadium.

FT  05 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: US statistics upset London trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A UK equity sector slow to return to work after the May Day holiday closed
on a sour note yesterday following disappointing economic news from across
the Atlantic. The sharp drop in the US index of leading economic indicators
in March - prompting an admission of 'cause for concern' from the White
House press secretary - halted London's earlier advance, which had reflected
firmness in bonds both in New York and London.
The fall in economic indicators, which checked an early gain on Wall Street
where the Dow Average was unchanged when London closed, heightened worries
that the recovery in the US economy might be losing momentum.
It was these worries, mirrored by signs that US investors might have been
switching into gold, that upset the UK stock market last week. Some London
strategists believe that Wall Street may be taking too sanguine a view of
the economic recovery and could soon face a significant correction.
UK equities opened firmly, still responding to indications that the domestic
economy has now turned the corner from recession towards recovery. Mr John
Major, the UK prime minister, told parliament yesterday that statistics
showing lower home repossessions added to the evidence that Britain is
heading towards recovery.
In early trading, the FT-SE 100 Index added 9.8 points, but trading volume
was woefully thin. This is the last week of a UK equity trading account
extended over three weeks to cover the May Day break. With the City of
London still taking a somewhat restrained view of the UK economic recovery
and of Wall Street, traders were inclined to stay out of the market until
the new trading account opens on Friday night.
The stock market soon lost its early peak of 2,822.9 on the Footsie but was
content to mark time in positive territory until Wall Street opened.
Firmness in New York bonds took the pressure off UK government stocks, and
gains in gilts in turn helped equities.
London quickly dipped below overnight levels when Wall Street lost its
initial gain, and although both markets steadied later, the FT-SE 100 ended
the day 0.5 off at 2,812.6.
Most of the day's features focused around company news, either actual or
expected. BAT Industries found buyers ahead of today's trading statement,
and similar factors brought some support among the UK clearing banks.
The stock market's evident unwillingness to renew its advance at present is
seen by some analysts as confirmation that it has settled into a trading
range of FT-SE 2,750 to 2,850 for the near term. Retail, or genuine
customer, interest in equities has remained satisfactory in spite of last
week's shakeout in shares. Stock Exchange statistics show that retail
business on Friday was worth Pounds 1.14bn, at the lower end of the range of
the past six months.
Second line issues were slower than the Footsie-listed stocks to react
yesterday to developments in New York. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, although off
the top, retained a net gain of 1.4 at 3,133.5.
Trading volume in non-Footsie stocks made up around 63 per cent of the day's
Seaq total of 422.8m shares, indicating a return to a more typical daily
market profile after a week which had seen the Footsie blue chips dominating
trading.

FT  05 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Campari upset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sports clothing company Campari plunged after the group astonished analysts
by announcing its second profits warning in less than two months.
Specialists had already scaled back estimates following the first warning in
mid-March, which preceded figures just over a fortnight ago.
Broker BZW was said to be predicting Pounds 1.6m but Campari said yesterday
that it would be lucky to break even in the coming year. The shares tumbled
to 120p before ending 45 down on balance at 133p.
An easier trend in sterling against the dollar helped the oil sector gain
ground. Shell, still stimulated by last week's excellent figures from its US
arm, Shell Oil, edged up 2 to 556p on good turnover of 4.6m shares, with at
least two of the big London-based investment houses, Smith New Court and
SGST, pushing the shares.
However, BP was not left behind and rose 1 1/2 to 294p; turnover was an
unspectacular 3.3m shares. Oppenheimer and Co, one of the most influential
US brokers, upgraded BP to its buy list. Enterprise Oil improved 7 to 488p
after relatively high turnover of 1.1m shares. Lasmo failed to make headway,
however, holding steady at 152p.
Aran Energy, on the other hand, appreciated 3 to 30 1/2 p, the highest level
since May 1991, after what was described as a very positive presentation in
London to UK oil analysts. Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, is
believed to have included the stock in its Capital International Index as
part of its Irish Portfolio.
Banks remained under pressure after a couple of recent bearish circulars
from brokers. These focused on the weakness of the UK banking sector's Tier
One capital ratios compared with those of the US banks, with the notable
exceptions of TSB and Abbey National. The latter moved up 6 to 391p.
Royal Bank of Scotland, due to announce interims today, edged up 3 to 267p.
The market is looking for the bank to top most analysts' forecasts, which
range from around Pounds 50m to Pounds 80m, compared with last time's Pounds
48m.
Drug issues were stronger following US buying on Monday. However, Glaxo
suffered from worries, emanating from a research presentation by Wellcome,
of a rival to its anti-migraine treatment. Analysts said the possibility of
a competing product from Wellcome would be countered by new developments
from Glaxo, but the latter lost 4 1/2 to 590p and the former rose 4 to 739p.
Pearson advanced 10 to 447p on reports that it is interested in taking a
stake in Hong Kong satellite television station STAR TV.
Reuters Holdings was 14 lower at 1245p as one securities house published a
bearish piece of research.
Negative comment was again undermining food retail issues. Weekend press
reports suggested that prices had been reduced because of competition from
discount supermarket chains, confirming the bearish view on the sector held
by several brokers. Tesco slipped 4 1/2 to 217 1/2 p, J. Sainsbury 6 to 461p
and Kwik Save 5 to 778p.
United Biscuits ebbed on profit-taking as the heralded bid failed to
materialise. The shares dipped 5 to 421p.
A positive annual statement from Unilever helped the shares climb 4 1/2 to
1087p. Tate &amp; Lyle added 4 at 405p ahead of today's results. A disposal of
some of its poultry interests lifted Hillsdown Holdings by 7 to 164p.
Interest in Kingfisher on optimism that its DIY business had experienced a
good Bank Holiday was dampened on the back of a dull stores sector. The
shares closed a penny adrift at 599p. Storehouse, which announced the
buy-back of some property interests, rose a penny to 209p.
Negative press comment and rumours of less than praiseworthy views from one
of the company's brokers weakened Ladbroke Group. The shares slipped a penny
to 162p.
The Premier League championship lifted Manchester United. The shares leapt
23 at one stage before settling 11 ahead at 463p. Euro Disney advanced 15 to
880p on hopes of a funding deal with Walt Disney.
Holiday group Owners Abroad declined 7 to 100p as criticism continued over
recent broker downgrades. Some analysts were said to be unhappy at the new
figures following Owners' previously bullish tone during its successful
defence against the Airtours bid. A big seller of Bass undermined the
shares, which retreated 9 to 534p. However, Grand Metropolitan attracted
support after its recent poor run and improved 5 to 415p.
Volex fell sharply to close 23 off at 389p after the chief executive left
the company and joined Farnell Electronics. Aerospace Engineering raced up 4
1/2 to 19p after selling Forward Industries to OMI International.
Confirmation that British Aerospace is setting up a joint venture in guided
weapons with Matra helped BAe shares move forward 6 to 328p.

Buying ahead of first-quarter results pushed tobacco and insurance group BAT
Industries higher yesterday. The shares, which have languished on fears of a
US tobacco price war, moved ahead 17 to 873p with 3.2m traded.
The market is looking for profits of around Pounds 350m, against Pounds 262m
for the same period last year. Nevertheless, yesterday's rise represents a
relatively small bounce. Although the move by US group Philip Morris to cut
the price of its Marlboro brand is not expected to impact on BAT's figures
to the end of March, BAT shares have fallen from Pounds 10 since the start
of April.
The quarterly results will include a currency gain of about Pounds 30m and
reflect stronger performance by BAT's insurance subsidiaries.

FT  05 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Waters sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Utilities attracted further selling across the board. Water shares were
notably weak after Kleinwort Benson, the stockbroker, reaffirmed its bearish
stance on the sector, in spite of steep falls over the past month.
Kleinwort said it remained concerned about the sector's performance,
primarily because of the economic recovery but also because of the
regulatory review due to be published in 1994 and diminishing hopes of
further UK interest rate cuts.
The water companies' preliminary results season starts on May 26, with
figures from North West Water. Over the sector Kleinwort expects profits to
rise by 5 per cent, earnings by 7.8 per cent and dividends by 8.8 per cent.
Of the water stocks in the FT-SE 100 Index, Thames was the worst performer,
losing 7 at 500p, after 499p, following the death of the chairman, Sir Roy
Watts. Anglian shed 6 to 488p, while Severn Trent dipped 5 to 480p and North
West the same amount to 481p. Kleinwort told its clients to continue to
switch into companies with strong financial ratios, such as Welsh Water and
Southern.

CHEMICALS group Courtaulds stood out in a listless London market as traders
suggested that investors were switching funds from ICI, which was further
weakened by a withdrawal of US interest. Courtaulds rose 5 to 562p while ICI
shed 16 to 1273p.
Initial speculation that Charterhouse Tilney, the stockbroker, was the
driving force was denied by the house and it appeared that existing
recommendations from Smith New Court might have held sway. Smith is a
renowned bear of ICI but is a buyer of Courtaulds on the basis that the
company's export market, which represents Pounds 400m of sales, is
benefiting from currency factors and US economic recovery.
Finally, dealers said that US brokers PaineWebber and CJ Lawrence, both
aggressive buyers, finally came off the bid yesterday. The two houses have
been primarily responsible for driving ICI's price higher and there was a
feeling that now the shares have hit Dollars 80, US investors may be happy
to take profits.

FT  05 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

IT WAS a return to more familiar territory in the futures market yesterday
as the excitement of last week's trading subsided and volumes were dictated
by a lack of direction, writes Christopher Price.
Following Friday's strong close, the June Footsie contract opened slightly
firmer at 2,824, reinforced by stronger gilts and a positive overnight Wall
Street. However, it was not long before June ran into sellers and slipped
back, hitting a morning low of 2,820. It then recovered, reaching 2,830 by
lunchtime on some good two-way business.
A day's high of 2,834 was attained just prior to Wall Street opening,
although the lack of direction here, too, contributed to June's slow drift
downwards. It hit a low of 2,816 late in the session before finishing at
2,819, ahead by 7 points from the cash market. Volume amounted to 8,364
lots.
Dealers said firmer after-hours' trading pointed to a higher opening this
morning.
Traded options were also a quiet market. Total volume came to 17,113
contracts, compared with 26,640 previously.
Lonrho topped the stock options with 2,833 lots transacted. This included a
buyer of 500 of the December 100 calls at 13p. Lucas Industries was second,
with turnover reaching 1,068. There was a seller of 1,000 of the August 140
puts at 12p. Volume in Thames Water totalled 604 contracts.

FT  05 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): OTC issues up on demand for
cable TV
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US EQUITY markets were mixed yesterday, with blue chip stocks little changed
but over-the-counter issues rising sharply amid heavy demand for cable
television and technology shares, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended a slight 0.27 off at 3,446.19. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.59 firmer at 444.05, while the Nasdaq composite
strengthened 11.45 to 678.16. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to
265m shares, and rises led declines by about two-to-one.
The latest set of economic data failed to move the markets, although once
again the news was not good, with the leading economic indicators down 1.0
per cent in March. The decline was bigger than forecast, and was the largest
monthly drop in almost 2 1/2 years.
On Monday the equity markets drew strength from a rally in the bond market
that was triggered by bad economic news. Yesterday, however, another bond
rally - the benchmark 30-year bond firmed almost   3/4 , lowering the yield
to 6.785 per cent - failed to lift stocks.
Investors remain worried that lower bond yields are the only thing
supporting share prices. If yields were to reverse course, the equity
markets could face a substantial sell-off.
Among individual stocks, cable television companies were in demand on hopes
that new regulations due to be imposed on the industry by the government
will turn out to be less onerous than originally feared.
On the NYSE, the biggest beneficiary was Time Warner, which rose Dollars 3
1/2 to Dollars 36 3/8 in volume of 3.3m shares, and was additionally buoyed
by rumours that Mr Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor, had bought a 5
per cent stake in the company. On the American Stock Exchange, Cablevision
jumped Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 33 1/4 .
OTC cable television stocks, traded on the Nasdaq market, were also up
sharply. Comcast advanced Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 20 5/8 , TCI Dollars 2
1/2 to Dollars 21 1/2 and TCA Cable Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 23 1/4 .
The 'E' class stock of General Motors, which represents the car group's
Electronic Data Systems subsidiary, fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 30 3/8 in
volume of 2.2m shares on news that the company's talks with UK
telecommunications group BT about a possible business alliance had broken
down.
Readers' Digest plunged Dollars 6, or 13 per cent, to Dollars 40 1/2 in
heavy trading on reporting disappointing first-quarter earnings. Morgan
Stanley, the securities house, followed the news by downgrading its rating
on the stock from a 'buy' to a 'hold'.
On the Nasdaq, Intel forged ahead Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 101 3/8 and
Microsoft climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 88 after the two companies
unveiled a new phone standard for personal computers.
Canada
TORONTO closed little changed after active trading. The TSE 300 index firmed
5.7 to 3,779.2 but declines outscored advances by 347 to 340 after volume of
56.4m shares.
Nine of the 14 stock groups closed higher, led by consumer products, up 0.8
per cent. The real estate group had the day's biggest decline, 1.1 per cent.
The financial services and golds sectors also finished easier.

FT  05 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Bangkok, Manila feature
in Pacific Rim region
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPPINE shares remained at all-time highs, although many markets were
lower elsewhere. Tokyo remained closed for the Golden Week holiday.
MANILA continued in record territory, with the market taking its lead from
PLDT's overnight gain on Wall Street. The composite index touched an
all-time intraday peak of 1,645.76 in late dealing before easing to end
21.06 up at a record 1,636.52.
A surge in foreign buying and falling interest rates have sparked the boom,
with investors convinced that strong economic growth will fuel a fresh bull
run.
The index has climbed 299 points, or 18.27 per cent, since February 1.
BANGKOK plunged across the board, led by losses in finance and bank shares
as investors were unnerved by a deputy minister's comment over the weekend
that a minister, identified only as 'Mr T', might be involved in share price
manipulation.
The SET index fell 17.19, or 2 per cent, to 828.10 in thin turnover of
Bt2.76bn.
HONG KONG saw waves of selected bargain hunting emerge in the afternoon,
reversing an early easier trend. The Hang Seng index closed 37.18 higher at
6,827.29 in turnover of HKDollars 3.5bn, after Monday's HKDollars 3.2bn.
The rebound was mainly due to active bargain hunting in Cheung Kong and
Hutchison Whampoa on rumours that Chinese companies were active buyers. The
shares rose 40 cents each to HKDollars 26.50 and HKDollars 19.60
respectively.
NEW ZEALAND lost a hefty 1.9 per cent in large volume amid rumoured changes
to the Morgan Stanley Capital International index and some suspected
overseas programme-linked selling. The NZSE-40 index shed 30.23 to 1,564.12.
Falls were seen across a wide front. Among the recently favoured forestry
stocks, Carter Holt Harvey relinquished 12 cents to NZDollars 2.90 and
Fletcher Challenge weakened 14 cents to NZDollars 2.60.
TAIWAN came in for late profit-taking which left the market lower after
sluggish trade. The weighted index, which opened slightly ahead, finished a
net 25.62 down at 4,448.18 in thin turnover of TDollars 25.5bn.
Financials were strong in early trade after some banks reported good April
profit figures, but investors soon sold to take quick profits.
AUSTRALIA edged slightly lower after the release of worse than expected data
showing a March current account deficit of ADollars 2.1bn, seasonally
adjusted, after ADollars 861m in February.
The All Ordinaries index ended 0.2 off at 1,664.3 in light turnover of
ADollars 240.9m.
COLOMBO continued its downward trend, although analysts noted that the
market had been declining even before the assassination of President
Ranasinghe Premadasa on Saturday. The all-share index finished 3.16 easier
at 532.60 in turnover that rose to Rp13.9m from Monday's Rp12.4m.
KUALA LUMPUR saw big losses in several blue chip stocks help to drag the
composite index down 11.29, or 1.6 per cent, to 706.08. A rumour about the
health of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad depressed sentiment.
Telekom fell 70 cents to MDollars 14.70, Genting shed 30 cents to MDollars
15.90 and Leader lost 40 cents to MDollars 18.60.
SINGAPORE fell broadly on continuous profit-taking in blue chips, but
brokers welcomed the correction, saying it was much needed. The Straits
Times Industrial index slipped 14.26 to 1,776.64. Foreign shares of national
carrier SIA closed 30 cents cheaper at SDollars 9.20.
Acma Industries, under profit-taking pressure after the highs seen following
a major Russian supply deal, has recovered in the last two days. It rose 20
cents to SDollars 6.35.
SEOUL closed slightly firmer in mixed trade after profit-taking jostled with
a mild rebound in blue chip manufacturers and some financial shares. The
composite index put on 1.24 at 719.83 .
News that South Korea's trade deficit in April eased to Dollars 94m from a
Dollars 470m shortfall a year earlier boosted steel and semiconductor
exporters.
JAKARTA was little changed after selective profit-taking in slow trade. The
official index firmed 0.22 to 313.91 after Monday's slight decline.
Jakarta International Hotel moved forward Rp150 to Rp8,200 on news of a
Dollars 250m hotel project in a joint venture with Conrad Hotels, a
subsidiary of Hilton Hotels.

FT  05 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Germany drifts lower ahead of strike
call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among European markets last week there was little reaction to a further
easing in interest rates. In fact, Germany drifted lower, with the prospect
of a strike by members of IG Metall, the engineering union, which began this
Monday, undermining sentiment.
However, another strong performance from Finland, counterbalancing an
equally poor showing from Mexico, and a year's high in Tokyo, helped to lift
the FT-Actuaries World index nearly 2 per cent.
Signs of an economic downturn in continental Europe, and particularly
Germany, have been evident for some time, with analysts becoming
increasingly bearish.
Goldman Sachs, in its latest strategy document, commenting on Germany,
expects the economy to deteriorate further in the second quarter. 'We feel
that the bulk of the market's anticipated strength for 1993 has been seen in
the first quarter and that the second and third quarters will be indifferent
at best.'
At Barclays de Zoete Wedd the view is echoed, while noting that 1994 may
show a revival, 'as provisions drop out, the lagged effect of easing shows
through and the stronger dollar helps overseas earners . . . but this does
not make 1994 immune from further downgrades, due to either cyclical
problems or structural overcapacity effects'.
The situation in France is scarcely better, with Nikko Europe commenting:
'There is every sign that GDP growth in the first quarter will be negative
which, given a 0.6 per cent fall in the fourth quarter of 1992, indicates
that the country is entering recession.'
Mexico tumbled as doubts persisted over whether or not the Nafta agreement,
which would phase out most trade barriers between the US, Canada and Mexico
from January 1994, would be approved by the US. This was followed by
disappointing results from Telmex, the largest private company in Mexico,
which prompted selling in New York.

FT  05 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Mixed performances from
Continental bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE were some mixed performances among bourses yesterday, writes Our
Markets Staff.
PARIS weakened in low turnover, the CAC-40 index losing 13.34 to 1,923.63,
off the day's high of 1,943 and a low of 1,914. Turnover was just FFr1.7bn.
Hoare Govett, in its latest strategy document, comments that after a strong
first quarter the market has now entered a period of consolidation.
'Economic fundamentals and corporate results still have the capacity to
disappoint, while the prospect of privatisations worth FFr30bn to FFr40bn by
the end of the year, as well as a number of cash calls, is likely to weigh
heavily on the market,' the brokers comment. 'In the short term we expect
trading to remain volatile, but the immediate risks suggest that it is
unlikely to be able to convincingly regain its levels of the end of the
first quarter.'
Peugeot slipped FFr6 to FFr544 as it reported a 17 per cent decline in new
car sales for April, while Euro Disney eradicated all of Monday's gains,
down FFr2.75 at FFr73.10.
FRANKFURT fell back from a day's high of 1,636 with the DAX index closing
down 1.79 at 1,627.37 in turnover of DM5.3bn.
During the session a Bundesbank council member said that he favoured more
rapid cuts in short-term interest rates to help economic recovery. However,
a contrary view came from the Federation of German Banks which said that
faster, deeper rate cuts would not automatically lead to recovery.
Car stocks were mixed with Volkswagen gaining DM2.50 to DM325.50 and Daimler
losing DM3.00 to DM574.50. Volkswagen has been one of the best performing
DAX stocks in the first four months of 1993, according to data supplied by
Merck Finck, showing a 33 per cent gain, while Daimler recorded a less
impressive 7 per cent rise.
In a recent report on the car sector Bank Julius Bar, notes that Daimler
will face a drastic decline in results in 1993; but with cost reduction
measures and the introduction of the new compact class from this summer, a
turnaround can be expected in 1994-1995.
AMSTERDAM was slightly easier ahead of today's results from Philips, off 30
cents at Fl 25.30. The CBS Tendency index closed down 0.4 at 107.2.
Goldman Sachs has a positive view of Philips given its reduction in net
debt, management changes, and significant job cuts, primarily in consumer
electronics. The brokers estimate an eps of Fl 1.00 for 1993 and Fl 3.00 for
1994. They forecast a first quarter loss of 30 cents per share relative to
year-ago earnings of 53 cents.
MILAN maintained its firmer trend amid optimism that the political situation
was stabilising although trading was restrained ahead of tomorrow's
parliamentary confidence vote on the government's programme. The Comit index
added 7.41 or 1.38 per cent to 546.03.
Blue chips and telecommunications stocks that are widely held outside Italy
were at the centre of buying attention.
Stet, the state telecommunications holding company, rose L25 to L2,660 in
the wake of Monday's announcement that 1992 consolidated net profit rose 0.8
per cent. Sip rose L7 to L1,948 in heavy volume of more than 11m shares on
the telematic trading system.
Among industrial blue chips, Fiat rose L75 to L6,850 and Montedison added
L26 to L1,229.
In the financial sector, Ras added L211 to L26,053 as the insurer said net
profit fell 53 per cent in 1992 as a result of extraordinary charges.
ZURICH was higher, helped by a firmer chemicals sector and renewed interest
in Nestle. The SMI index rose 7.2 to 1,260.
Nestle returned to favour, having been neglected for some time. The bearer
and registered stocks each rose SFr15 to SFr1,100 and SFr1,090 respectively,
ahead of next week's annual news conference.
Ciba-Geigy, continuing to gain support from brokers' recommendations, rose
SFr6 to SFr610. Holderbank bearers dipped SFr2 to SFr628 after it left the
1992 dividend unchanged.
BRUSSELS fell back, the Bel-20 index finishing down 7.93 at 1,181.59 in
turnover of some BFr1.2bn. Petrofina fell for the fourth consecutive day,
down BFr160 at BFr8,220.
COPENHAGEN gained 2.4 per cent in fairly sizeable trading due to foreign
buying and a dearth of sellers. The KFX index rose 2.02 to 86.79.
The KFX June future, indicating the market view of medium-term prospects,
rose 1.85 to 90.35 with interest centred on the shipping and banking
sectors.
STOCKHOLM advanced in heavy trading led by gains in Ericsson and Astra. The
Affarsvarlden index rose 9.2 to 1041.4 in turnover of SKr1.13m from Monday's
SKr635m.
An SKr11 advance to SKr687 by Astra's B shares was attributed to rising
prices for pharmaceuticals issues in New York. LM Ericsson's B shares rose
SKr13 to an all-time high of SKr284, boosted by news and rumors of major
orders. Expectations of a strong first-quarter earnings report next week
also played a part.
OSLO fell sharply on disappointing results. The All-share index dropped 7.07
or 1.5 per cent to 475.65 in turnover of NKr490m.
ISTANBUL fell nearly 3 per cent as investors took profits after recent
strong gains. The index closed down 224.57 at 7,580.74.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar softer on US indicators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR remained soft against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday
following another set of weak indicators on the US economy, writes James
Blitz.
In Monday's US trading, the dollar weakened against the German currency
after the National Association of Purchasing Managers reported that its
index, which measures manufacturing activity, had slipped below 50 per cent
in April for the first time since September 1992.
The gloom on the US economy was compounded yesterday by news that the
leading indicators had fallen by 1.0 per cent, the sharpest decline since
1990. The dollar bottomed out at DM1.5690 before recovering a little to end
at DM1.5710, more than 1 1/2 pfennigs down on the day. In New York it ended
steadier at DM1.5745.
In Europe, most currencies remained relatively strong against the D-Mark
amid continuing signs that the German economic situation was worsening.
Western Germany's industrial production figures for March fell 0.6 per cent,
while February's decline was revised down to 1.3 per cent from 1.0 per cent.
Manufacturing output dropped 1.0 per cent in March, adding to speculation
that the Bundesbank will have to cut interest rates aggressively to
stimulate the economy.
This data helped the French franc peak at FFr3.3670, its highest level since
the autumn of last year. It later fell back to close at FFr3.373 from a
previous FFr3.370.
At the same time, the spread between three-month French francs and
three-month D-Marks continued to narrow, and was yesterday at only 9 basis
points. This is a strong sign of the market's confidence in the franc and
its belief that the French currency needs to carry no premium against
devaluation.
At the same time, both the Belgian franc and Dutch guilder performed
strongly relative to the D-Mark, indicating that investors prefer to invest
in these currencies instead of the D-Mark. Both currencies were some 33
basis points above the D-Mark inside the exchange rate mechanism grid,
having been some 29 basis points higher before the weekend.
One strong exception to this trend was sterling, which drifted down against
the D-Mark throughout the day.
In part, this may have been due to new uncertainty about whether the UK
would ratify the Maastricht treaty on European Monetary Union. Yesterday,
the speaker of the House of Commons created a possibility for a vote to be
held on the Maastricht ratification bill which, if it goes ahead, will
almost certainly result in defeat for the UK government.
There was some speculation in money markets that the UK might cut base rates
again later this month. UK newspapers speculated at the weekend that the
next unemployment figures in the UK could show a strong rise. The pound
finished at DM2.4675, down 2 1/2 pfennigs on the day.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Money Markets: Bullishness on sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING futures were slightly higher yesterday amid fledgling expectations
of another cut in UK interest rates at some point later this year, writes
James Blitz.
In the last few weeks, nobody in the sterling market has been betting too
strongly one way or the other on UK base rate moves.
However, there was some newspaper speculation at the weekend that the next
figures for UK unemployment might show a net rise, in contrast to the drops
seen in the last two months, forcing the UK auth-orities to look for new
ways to stimulate the economy.
Several other factors have also made dealers wonder whether the UK
authorities might lower rates again.
First, sterling has been testing the DM2.50 level against the D-Mark in
recent days. The UK authorities might take the view that too strong a pound
would damage UK export prospects in what are already difficult markets.
Secondly, the Bundesbank indicated last week that it may be set for more
aggressive easing of German interest rates than has been seen thus far,
enhancing the possibility of another UK rate reduction.
Yesterday, the Bundesbank announced that it would hold a two-tranche tender
for securities repurchase funds this week.
Few dealers expect the repo rate to come far below last week's level of 7.75
per cent this week and, with call money yesterday trading higher than this,
at 7.82 per cent, there is even speculation that the repo rate may rise.
However, as one dealer suggested yesterday, the dollar is performing so
weakly against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges that the Bundesbank may
take the opportunity to cut rates now, knowing that this will have no
consequences for imported inflation.
The bears' case on UK rates is still relatively strong, of course. In
particular, there are worries that another rate cut would push Britain's
inflation rate outside the limits set by the UK government.
The June short sterling contract was up 4 basis points at one stage
yesterday, at 93.94, before finishing at 93.93. The September contract ended
4 basis points higher at 93.98.
In the cash market, three-month money closed at 6 1/16 per cent, down 1/16
percentage point. A small shortage of Pounds 450m helped to ease short-dated
rates.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Survey of Bulgaria (12): Casualties of the state farms - The
shake-up in agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLLECTIVISATION of Bulgarian farming 45 years ago was a catastrophe.
The first stages of de-collectivisation carry the risk of a similar
dislocation - albeit without the coercion and violence which accompanied the
communists' destruction of private and peasant system of farming.
The slaughter of thousands of animals is perhaps the most tangible sign of
the confusion which has followed the dismantling of state co-operatives by
government-appointed liquidation committees.
'Animals were given to peasants who did not have land to keep them on,' says
Mr Georgy Tanev, who became minister of agriculture earlier this year. 'In
addition, the committees were run by people with no experience of
agriculture who sold off co-operatives' fodder before returning the
animals.'
The result was the slaughter of 1.9m sheep, 460,000 pigs and 235,000 heads
of cattle in 1992 alone, he says. The drop in the number of animals has had
a knock-on effect on the food processing industries.
'We're running well below capacity because our supply of milk is about one
third of what it was two years ago,' says Mr Peycho Zagorski, manager of the
Topalitza dairy in Karlovo, a small town in the Valley of the Roses in
central Bulgaria.
Production can begin only at midday, he says. Before that the dairy's trucks
travel up to 100km to pick up milk from around 50 collection points. 'Around
90 per cent of the milk now comes from private farmers but they cannot meet
the demand. Hardly any of them have more than 15 cows.'
Between the Balkan and Sredna Gora mountain ranges, the break-up of state
co-operatives has led to subsistence farming on small plots of land, divided
by stakes and rows of stones. Unlike the previous 50 years, the fields are
hives of activity. People work their newly returned land at weekends and
late into the evening.
But the level of technology - horse-drawn carts, spades and wooden ploughs -
is a throwback to the pre-industrial age. Meanwhile, the oversize machines
of the communist era lie unused in abandoned collective farms.
'Farmers don't have the machines they can work with. Russian tractors can't
even turn around on the size of the plots which are being given back to
people,' says Mr Stewart Campbell, head of an EC-financed Phare project
which has pledged Ecu 50m to help agricultural reform since 1990.
Nevertheless, Mr Campbell believes the best way forward is to press ahead
with land restitution as provided for in the 1991 land law. This gives
former owners and their heirs the right to reclaim up to 30 hectares of
farmland.
'Once people receive their land with the full titles, a land market will
emerge. Consolidation into more economically viable units should then take
place,' he says.
However, land restitution has been slower than anticipated. By mid-April
only 13.3 per cent of arable land had been returned to owners within its
final borders, admits the Ministry of Agriculture.
'Part of the problem is that we don't have good records. The communists
destroyed land registers and any reference to private property,' says Mr
Evgeniy Matinchev, the deputy prime minister.
But restitution has also become a sensitive political issue. The government,
which relies on the support of the socialist party to stay in power, is
under pressure to stem the decline in production caused by the break-up of
collective farms.
'We need to find other ways of managing the land before it is handed over.
We do not want to divide up all the large farms, especially those with
long-maturity crops such as vineyards and orchards. Redistributing the land
in its original borders would destroy these,' says Mr Matinchev.
While adamant that restitution remains a priority, Mr Tanev believes one
solution is the encouragement of private co-operatives. 'We need people to
work together to plant, produce and look after the animals,' the agriculture
minister says. 'Private co-operatives bear little resemblance to those we
had under the communist system. Members are free to make their own
decisions, like shareholders in a company.'
But Bulgaria's main opposition party, the Union of Democratic Forces, an
anti-communist alliance, disagrees. 'These co-operatives will slow down and
even stop real restitution,' says Mr Vlado Stoentchev, the UDF mayor of
Velingrad, a small town 130km from Sofia.
'People are being manipulated into forming a copy of the former structures
without being given the chance to explore the alternatives,' he says. 'It's
vital for land to be privatised, then the owners can decide for themselves.
That is why this municipality is leading a war against moves to re-form
co-operatives.'

FT  05 MAY 93 / Survey of Bulgaria (11): A new image for tourism -
Privatisation may spur more upmarket visitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By THEODOR TROEV
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BULGARIA'S privatisation agency has just been presented with a plan to
upgrade the country's tourist industry through privatisation and foreign
investment. 'We are targeting some 500 potential western investors, and over
50 of them are already showing interest in the privatisation of our tourism
industry,' says Mr Yaroslav Karaboikov, senior expert at the privatisation
agency's tourism division.
The plan calls for the privatisation of 30 companies, including Black Sea
resorts, hotels, tour operators and other travel-related firms, by the end
of the year. Committee of Tourism officials say that most of the currently
existing 150 state companies in the sector should be privatised by 1998.
The hope is that privatisation will help Bulgaria's tourist industry improve
its quality of service and target more upmarket visitors. Under communism,
the country was forced into the lower end of the mass tourism market: cheap
package holidays in block-like hotels along the sandy Black Sea coast. Most
of the 2m tourists a year came from the former eastern bloc countries.
In 1989, tourists from eastern Europe accounted for 63 per cent of all
holiday makers in Bulgaria. Last year their numbers dropped to 18 per cent.
They have been partially replaced by an influx of western tourists, a trend
which should encourage foreign investment.
A list of potential western buyers is appended to a programme developed by a
team of international consultants Arthur Andersen. Last July the consultants
won an EC Phare programme tender to advise the government on privatisation.
They used as a starting point a study of Bulgaria's tourism sector funded by
the British Know How Fund and completed by the UK group Horwath Consulting
last August.
According to Horwath, the future of Bulgarian tourism lies in the
development of specialised package tours, catering for those interested in
history, religion, arts, archit - ecture, rural tourism and hunting. The
country has much more to offer than cheap summer seaside or winter skiing
packages. It boasts a wealth of Thracian, Roman and Byzantine remains,
monasteries and mosques as well as extensive woodlands and mountains.
The report also recommended developing religious heritage trails, converting
former monasteries to hotels, and restoring a royal train. It identified
other opportunities in conference travel, spa treatment and ecological
tourism. Casinos, roadside tourism and holiday villages emerged as other
attractive targets.
Horwath emphasised the need for speedy privatisation. Though some 3,000 of
the country's 3,150 tourism-related companies are private, they account for
only 10 per cent of the total turnover. Obstacles to foreign investment
include unclear ownership due to the restitution of property to its former
owners, and ambiguous legislation. The Committee of Tourism is expected to
submit a Tourism Bill to the government later this month.
Arthur Andersen's privatisation strategy mainly targets big western
investors. But the Committee of Tourism and the Privatisation Agency have
also considered proposals put forward by Bulgarian consultants such as
Intertourist-consult, Deni and Triada Consulting.
Meanwhile Balkan Holidays and Balkantourist, the country's main tour
operators, report steady demand from Germany, Britain, Austria, the
Netherlands, and the Scandinavian countries. Bulgaria's tranquil Black Sea
coast offers an alternative to Croatian coast resorts that have been closed
because of the fighting in former Yugoslavia.
'We had a successful winter season, and most of the summer vacations that we
offer have also been booked,' says Mr Ognian Avgarski, president of Balkan
Holidays International. 'This year we expect to bring over 150,000 western
tourists through our companies in 17 countries.'
Balkan Holidays is also working on a privatisation plan, but is taking a
cautious approach. Mr Avgarski believes a management buyout might be a
better option than allowing western tour operators to obtain a majority
stake.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Survey of Bulgaria (13): Nuclear power needed - The Energy
Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By THEODOR TROEV
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BULGARIA has got through the winter without the power cuts which used to
make life a misery and disrupt the economy, writes Theodor Troev.
The improvement is partly due to three years of sharply falling energy
demand from the hard-hit heavy industrial sector. But lower demand has been
coupled with diversification away from near-total dependence on Soviet oil
and Ukrainian coal and safety improvements to the Kozloduy nuclear energy
complex.
Higher energy prices are also creating a more efficient and rational energy
market. Recently the government announced it would raise electricity prices
by 50 per cent for households and 10 per cent for industry from this month.
Coal and central heating prices are also to go up. In February, petrol
prices rose 50 per cent.
These were hard decisions, but there was little alternative after decades
when domestic consumers paid far below energy costs. 'With the price hikes,
subsidies will be kept to a minimum,' says Mr Nikita Shervashidze, deputy
chairman of the Committee of Energy.
Cuts in energy subsidies are part of the price for obtaining the help of the
international financial institutions such as the World Bank, which is
providing a Dollars 93m credit to complete the Chaira project.
Chaira, the biggest water pump storage dam in the Balkans, has been under
construction for more than a decade. It will use off-peak electricity to
pump water uphill and generate hydroelectric power during peak periods. Its
first 210MW generator starts operating this month and three similar units
are scheduled to come into operation by 1995.
Hydroelectricity, however, remains relatively unimportant, generating some 6
per cent of the country's energy, compared to 54 per cent generated by
thermo-electric power stations, and 40 per cent by the nuclear complex at
Kozloduy.
Bulgaria is now working on an 'energy charter' which focuses on two main
areas: the better use of indigenous lignite and nuclear power, according to
Mr Shervashidze. To reduce pollution and raise efficiency, locally mined
coal of low calorific value is being mixed with imported coal from Indonesia
and South Africa.
Under the charter plans several coalmines will be closed. Of 14 mines in
Bulgaria that employ 65,000, only four are now profitable. A holding company
will be set up to manage the mines and decide which should close.
Meanwhile, a continuing role is projected for nuclear power, which has
contributed an increasing proportion of Bulgaria's energy since the first
Soviet-made reactor started operating at Kozloduy on the Danube in the late
1960s.
After a damaging report by the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy
Agency in 1991, two of the plant's four 440MW pressurised water reactors
were shut down. One of these units has since been repaired with
international support, a long list of safety improvements have been made and
staff have been retrained. Last month a new, 1,000MW reactor, which
incorporates many western safety features, began operation.
On safety standards Mr Shervashidze says Kozloduy is no worse than some
western plants. Its two oldest reactors are due to be phased out within five
years. They are likely to be replaced, however, by a new nuclear plant,
either at Kozloduy itself or at another site.
Many western critics still regard Kozloduy as a nuclear time bomb. Mr
Jacques Attali, the EBRD president, recently called it 'especially
dangerous' and said that Kozloduy would be the first among eastern Europe's
outdated reactors to get financial aid from a nuclear safety fund, newly
established by the G-7 and managed by the bank.
But Mr Shervashidze argues that for Bulgaria, which imports some 70 per cent
of its primary energy, nuclear power provides the only independent energy
source. The unreliability of supplies from the former Soviet Union has
underlined the need for alternative sources, he adds.
Some relief may be at hand if western companies such as British Gas,
Enterprise Oil, Texaco, and OMV of Austria find oil and gas for which they
are prospecting. But these new sources of energy would be earmarked for
export to earn hard currency and the government is now considering building
a new plant on the Danube.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Survey of Bulgaria (14): Tobacco industry seeks greater
incentives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By THEODOR TROEV
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BULGARIAN tobacco industry executives want the government to offer better
incentives to newly privatised producers and potential foreign investors to
revive what is traditionally one of the country's best earners, writes
Theodor Troev.
International tobacco companies Rothmans and Reynolds have indicated their
readiness to invest heavily in Bulgaria.
However, Bulgarian tobacco growers face short-term difficulties if agrarian
reform does not stimulate production from fields that have newly been
returned to private owners. Last year, production was only half what it was
in the early 1980s when Bulgaria was thebiggest tobacco producer in Europe
with a 19 per cent market share and was the world's seventh largest
producer. Now the country produces only 10 per cent of Europe's tobacco, and
ranks 14th in the world.
Bulgartabac, the state-owned tobacco monopoly, was once the world's biggest
exporter of cigarettes and the second largest tobacco exporter. Tobacco and
cigarettes accounted for half of Bulgaria's exported processed agricultural
products.
But the US overtook Bulgaria in the 1980s and now exports more than twice as
much tobacco. The loss of former Soviet and Comecon markets in recent years
has crippled export sales. Bulgar- tabac's exports to the CIS last year were
only 76 per cent of those to the Soviet Union in 1991. Exports to Poland,
Hungary and Czechoslovakia also fell after customs duties went up to protect
their industries.
Bulgartabac officials complain that the Bulgarian government did just the
opposite last year when it cut customs duties from 80 to 40 per cent. As a
result cigarette imports rose to 6.5m kg in 1992, equal to the annual
production of 10,000 Bulgarian farmers, according to the Union of Tobacco
Producers.
Meanwhile, farmers complain that the prices paid for their tobacco by the
state monopoly cover under 70 per cent of production costs. The UTP claims
that, given the incentive of higher prices, tobacco production could leap to
100m kg. As it is, Bulgaria's 12 tobacco-processing plants and nine
cigarette-producing factories operated at only 60 per cent of capacity last
year.

foreign trade picture has changed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE changing face of Plovdiv Fair, Bulgaria's largest annual trade event,
epitomises the transformation taking place in Bulgaria's foreign trade.
Four years ago, it was the classic Comecon trade exhibition where member
states exchanged machines and capital goods according to pre-arranged
quotas. These days, the fair offers Bulgarian companies the latest in
western technology and consumer goods and acts as a showcase for Bulgarian
companies, both state and private, which are looking for partnerships with
foreign concerns.
'The fair reflects the change in the country's trade and commercial
structure,' says Ms Maria Todorova, head of public affairs. 'Already, more
than half of the Bulgarian exhibitors are from the private sector while the
growth in trade with western countries has boosted foreign participation.
This year we have participants from more than 35 countries.'
The collapse of Comecon and the liberalisation of trade has opened up
opportunities, especially in the Black Sea region. 'We want to promote
Bulgaria as a bridge for trade with the Black Sea zone and the former Soviet
Union. Western companies can market themselves in the region from here,'
says Ms Todorova. Bulgaria's traditionally strong relations with the FSU may
give it an advantage over neighbouring countries Greece and Turkey which are
also trying to build up their trade relations.
'In a confused period like this, contacts and trust between business
partners become vital. Official relations between Bulgaria and the former
Soviet Union may have changed but the personal contacts are very much
alive,' says Mr Konstantinos Livadas, a Greek investment consultant based in
Sofia. 'Greek firms realise this. Many are using Bulgarians as middlemen for
trade with the FSU.'
According to the Ministry of Trade, the FSU accounted for only 28 per cent
of Bulgaria's foreign trade last year compared to 75 per cent in 1989. In
contrast, trade with western countries continued to grow. The European
Community, with which Bulgaria has just signed an association agreement,
accounted for 31 per cent of the country's trade in 1992.
But most doubt the accuracy of the official figures, due to incomplete
information on the private sector and the thriving black economy. 'It's very
hard to keep track of what private companies are up to but we believe
Bulgarian firms are very active in the former east bloc, and especially in
Russia,' says Mr Ivan Kolev, head of the eastern European department at the
Ministry of Trade.
He believes there are already some signs of a revival in trade with the
former Comecon countries, especially those exporting products made in
partnership with foreign investors. With goods such as washing powder from
Procter and Gamble's Rakona plant and Skoda/Volkswagen cars popular with
Bulgarian consumers, imports from the Czech and Slovak republics and Hungary
grew last year.
While underlining that the country remains committed to developing closer
trading links with the west, Mr Kolev says Russia remains a vital trading
partner for Bulgaria. 'Above all, we need spare parts - many of our
industries run solely on Russian-made equipment,' he explains.
He is also looking to the future: 'Russia is a vast country with many
resources. Links with western markets give us new possibilities but they
cannot substitute for the opportunities in the east.' He welcomes
initiatives to revive economic co-operation between the former Comecon
countries which were discussed at the April meeting in Copenhagen between
the EC and its eastern European associate members.
Bulgaria hopes to join the trade pact agreed between Hungary, Poland and the
Czech and Slovak republics last year.' A regional free trade area will help
us in the short term. It can also foster eventual integration into the EC -
unlike in the past, we will work to international practices and standards,'
Mr Kolev says.
But there are other reasons for pursuing rapprochement with the former east
bloc. 'We need time to adapt our production and raise standards to be
competitive in the west,' says Mr Valentin Karabashev, minister of trade.
He deplores the EC's decision last month to ban the import of livestock and
dairy products from eastern Europe. 'It is a worrying precedent. Bulgarians
think that behind the formal reasons were purely economic motives. The
restrictions came exactly at Easter time when the price of lamb on the Greek
and Italian markets is at its highest.'

FT  05 MAY 93 / Survey of Bulgaria (7): Why progress has been slow -
Privatisation prospects

BULGARIA is the laggard in east European privatisation. Not even one large
or medium state enterprise has yet passed into private hands. But this does
not mean that nothing has happened. Wide-scale restitution has returned
thousands of shops and other forms of property to former owners in towns and
villages accompanied by a partial and controversial restitution of land in
the countryside.
The most controversial aspect of the process is widespread hidden or
nomenklatura privatisation, which really means illegal asset stripping and
theft of state or municipal property, often in ingenious ways.
The slow progress of formal privatisation is part of the price being paid
for the difficult and confused political transition from an ossified
communist regime in a country where neither parliamentary democracy nor
capitalism ever had strong roots.
The slow pace has led to disillusion with the reform process which reflects
a widespread belief that the 'reform communists' who took over power from
the Zhivkov clique in 1989 and transformed themselves into the Bulgarian
Socialist party (BSP) spent their first year in power salting away state
property in private accounts or making sure that former party members
remained in key positions.
A typical mechanism for 'privatising profit' while leaving the loss-making
enterprises in formal state ownerships entails the formation of private
companies linked to the family and friends of nomenklatura managers. The
private companies are able to 'buy' products or assets at artificially low
prices, ensuring losses for the enterprise but big profits for the new
private owners or traders.
Throughout the former Soviet empire, the mechanism is well-known but it is
particularly well entrenched in Bulgaria, where much of the legislation
needed to back up the transformation to a market economy has yet to obtain
parliamentary approval.
Mr Valentin Karabashev, the young deputy prime minister who has the
difficult task of trying to co-ordinate government economic policy, says:
'Such so-called 'hidden privatisation' discredits the formal privatisation
process and slows it down.' The only way to struggle against hidden
privatisation, he adds, is to speed up open privatisation.
But a succession of five governments in three years, slowness in approving
enabling legislation and differing views on how to proceed between the
various ministries and the Privatisation Agency, have combined to stultify
progress.
Mr Alexander Bozhkov, executive director of the Privatisation Agency, for
example, opposes the sort of mass privatisation through vouchers pioneered
by the Czech republic and under way in differing versions in Poland,
Hungary, Russia and elsewhere. He argues that a mere redistribution of
ownership is not enough. 'We have not yet succeeded in finding the best way
for Bulgaria. We are experimenting with MBOs, ESOPs, virtually everything
except complicated voucher programmes. But if they don't work, we'll
probably opt for some form of voucher system too,' he concedes.
Meanwhile legislation remains incomplete. The restitution law, returning
physical property to those with valid claims, was passed by parliament in
January last year followed by the privatisation law last April. But the law
which provides compensation for those unable to reclaim physical assets,
which might have been knocked down or transformed into blocks of flats or
factories, has already gone through three drafts and has not yet been
finalised. Neither has the bankruptcy law, without which it is virtually
impossible to close down chronic loss makers.
At present 12 companies are being privatised while 84 companies have been
selected for the first round of the process. Up to 20 per cent of shares in
privatised companies will be offered to employees at a 50 per cent discount,
but only up to the equivalent of one year's salary. A further 20 per cent of
shares have to be set aside for purchase by yet to be established mutual
funds. In practice, however, foreign investors will be able to buy up to 95
per cent of target enterprises, Mr Bozhkov says.
To facilitate privatisation, many of the large industrial combines employing
tens of thousands of workers have been split up into several smaller units
and 'commercialised' by being transformed into joint stock companies whose
shares at present remain owned by the treasury.
Up to now, however, there is little foreign interest in such plants while
few Bulgarians have the resources or the desire to take them over. Some will
survive, others face bankruptcy. In Bulgaria the shift to a private economy
may take considerable time, and it may be largely through greenfield
investments in new industries and technologies than through the more complex
task of privatising and then converting Soviet-style factories into modern,
competitive units.
