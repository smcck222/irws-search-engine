FT  05 MAY 93 / Survey of Bulgaria (9): Software medallist seeks IBM deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL now, the Bulgarian computer industry has been known in the west for
its export of sophisticated computer viruses like the Dark Avenger. But now
the Cold War is over, some of the country's talented computer hacks, trained
in the years when Bulgaria was the main computer software and electronics
producer within Comecon and the Warsaw Pact, are putting their skills to
more profitable use, writes Virginia Marsh.
Mr Todor Todorov is one such specialist turned entrepreneur. In March,
SynthesisSoft, the company he set up with a friend in 1990, won a silver
medal at CeBit, Europe's largest software exhibition, for its AlphaWin
program which adds Cyrillic and other eastern European languages to Windows,
the word processing and desk-top publishing program.
'The exhibition opened up many contacts for a small firm from a small
country. We are now discussing joint development with a number of western
companies.' says Mr Todorov, a modest 40-year-old who worked until 1990 in
the computer department of the Bulgarian Sports Union.
In particular, he is hoping the company will become an IBM developer. 'This
would give us quick access to IBM databases and software tools, increasing
our chances of coming up with good programs. Money isn't as much as a
problem as lack of information - Bulgarian firms need access to the latest
developments.'
SynthesisSoft has already shown that much can be achieved on a shoestring
budget. For the first two years, the company, working out of a small flat in
Sofia's suburbs, raised capital by assembling computers for the home market
from Taiwanese components. 'We always wanted to develop software but we had
no money. A loan was too expensive - the lending rate is more than 60 per
cent - and too risky in an industry like this where two years of research
might have produced nothing.'
Using profit gleaned from turnover of about Dollars 35,000 in 1990 and 1991,
the company last year turned to developing and selling software. With the
success of AlphaWin and of English-Russian and Bulgarian computer
dictionaries, turnover jumped to Dollars 100,000 last year. Mr Todorov
expects to double sales in 1993.
In spite of the success at CeBit, Mr Todorov is looking for partnership only
with western firms. 'We don't want to be bought out by one of the large
computer companies - yet. We have many more ideas which we would prefer to
work on first as a small unit.'
Unlike many new entrepreneurs, he takes a long-term view. 'Many private
firms are making money in trade and spending it on fast cars. We're trying
to increase our scope by reinvesting our profits in more powerful
computers.'

FT  05 MAY 93 / Survey of Bulgaria (8): Pilot project gets ready for
lift-off

BULGARIA is hoping the sale of Balkan Bulgarian Airlines, the national
carrier, will put its privatisation programme on the map, writes Virginia
Marsh.
'Balkan is the first large company to be put forward for privatisation. We
are effectively a pilot project for the whole process,' says Mr Kostadin
Botev, managing director. He hopes the airline, which is being advised by SG
Warburg, the UK merchant bank, will be sold off by the autumn, after two
years of restructuring. 'We've reduced our staff from 4,100 to 3,700 but
still managed to increase our route network to 64 destinations.'
Balkan begins its second marketing phase with a short list of potential
foreign partners this month. On offer to foreign investors is up to 49 per
cent of the airline, the second largest in the former east bloc after
Aeroflot.
The state is expected to retain a minority shareholding of around 40 per
cent with the remainder going to Balkan employees and other domestic
investors. Mr Botev believes Balkan, with its strategic position on Europe's
south eastern flank, has two major options - to link up with either a
European or an Asian carrier.
To make the airline more attractive, the Bulgarian government has made
Balkan the single carrier on its network for 15 years and agreed to
modernise Sofia airport.
Mr Botev says Balkan's low labour costs should be attractive to investors:
'Only 7 per cent of our costs go on salaries compared to an average of 30
per cent at western airlines.' But the airline's future owners will have to
foot the bill for the replacement of Balkan's Soviet-made fleet whose high
energy consumption and noise levels do not meet western standards.
With foreign debt negotiations deadlocked, the airline has been unable to
secure credits to buy western aircraft. Instead, it has leased four Airbus
A-320s, three Boeing 737s and the two Boeing 767s but this has proved
expensive. Leasing costs gobbled up 91 per cent of operating profits of
Dollars 12.4m in the first half of 1992.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Survey of Bulgaria (6): Loan goes adrift - Banking reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKING reform has become critical for Bulgaria. The Berov administration is
under mounting pressure to take steps to clean up and strengthen the banking
system if Bulgaria is to rally the outside support it needs to continue with
its transition to a market economy.
Both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Bulgaria's largest
sources of external financing in the past three years, have tied further
loans to progress in implementing banking reform.
Already the second half of a Dollars 250m structural adjustment loan from
the World Bank has been held up by delays in tackling this issue. Western
institutions are concerned by the lack of financial sector regulations and
by the growing level of enterprise debt on the books of state commercial
banks.
The debts, accumulated by insolvent state firms and estimated at Lv35-60bn
(Dollars 1.35-2.31bn), are even pushing some banks into bankruptcy. Others
cannot be considered for privatisation or as partners for western banks
until the debt issue is resolved.
The government has said it will take action but to date has made no firm
decisions. 'After 2 1/2 years of discussion there is still no consensus on
the Bulgarian side as to how to tackle state enterprise debt,' says one
western consultant. 'There is an awareness that something must be done but
that's it. They are drifting while all the time the situation gets worse.'
One problem is that the country's financial institutions have conflicting
interests, he says. 'The central bank is concerned about the effect of a
settlement on the banking system, the ministry of industry about state firms
and the finance ministry about the cost to the budget.'
The responsibility for financial sector regulation, on the other hand, lies
primarily with the National Bank of Bulgaria, an independent body
accountable to parliament alone. The Central Bank Act of 1991 gave the
national bank a supervisory role as well as control over exchange rate,
credit and interest rate policies.
The bank, too, has delayed action, issuing some prudential regulations only
last month. These follow standard international practices and include rules
on capital adequacy ratios, liquidity and licensing.
Even now, Mr Todor Vulchev, the bank's governor, acknowledges banking
regulation is far from being a reality. 'The difficulty will come in
implementation. First, most of the state commercial banks don't understand
the new regulations. Second, we are not in the best position to supervise
them.
'Like other public institutions, we have lost many of our best staff to the
private sector. We are now training new people with the help of the US
Treasury and Federal Reserve Bank but, inevitably, this takes time.'
The central bank is also likely to face resistance to the new regulations
from the private financial sector. 'There are powerful groups out there who
have been following their own rules for the past three years,' says one
western banker. 'Some of them have set up 'banks' as fronts for their own
business activities.
'It will be hard to unravel exactly what is going on, not least because many
of these private bankers have contacts inside the government and the central
bank who will try to shelter them.'
One area, however, where progress has been made is in 'bank consolidation'.
This involves the merging of 80 state commercial banks, created by the
communists in the mid-1980s, into eight to 10 new banking groups, considered
sufficient for a country of 8.5m
The first merger, the United Bulgarian Bank, which brought together 22
banks, began operations in January. 'We hope to form four more groups by
July, leaving only three banks unresolved,' says Mr Plamen Petrov, executive
director of the Bank Consolidation Company which was set up in November 1991
to oversee the process.
But he, too, stresses the need for wide-reaching banking reform. 'The EBRD
is interested in a stake in the UBB. Through this it could open credit lines
to the private sector. But it is unlikely to go ahead without more banking
supervision and a solution to the internal debt problem,' he says.
The central bank would like to see more foreign banks enter the Bulgarian
market but this, too, hangs largely on the outcome of foreign debt
negotiations.
Meanwhile Austria's Raffeissen bank has taken a 35 per cent stake in the
Bank for Agricultural Credit and several Arab and other European banks have
set up representative offices. A few new banks with grand names and
influential backers, such as the International Bank for Investment and
Development, in which the former finance minister of the Shah is a major
shareholder, are also setting up to offer services in competition to the
First Private Bank and other fledgling local banks which have emerged in the
past two years.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Survey of Bulgaria (5): Persistence may pay off - Foreign
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH its cocktail bars, shops full of expensive goods and luxury cars, Sofia
has acquired some of the gloss of a western city. But looks are deceptive.
While western companies have been quick to set up shop in Bulgaria, far
fewer have ventured beyond trade or committed themselves to large
investments, writes Virginia Marsh.
Official figures put direct foreign investment in 1991 and 1992 at Dollars
100m, a fraction of the over Dollars 7bn in equity capital which has poured
into central Europe since 1990.
Foreign investors have been deterred by Bulgaria's comparatively slow and
faltering steps towards a market economy. These have led to many political
and legislative upheavals in the past three years and been accompanied by a
moratorium on debt payment since mid-1990 which has cut the country off from
normal bank credit.
'We've had to deal with five governments and many changes in the legal
framework, including significant amendments to the first (post-communist)
foreign investment and privatisation laws,' says Mr Philip Burley of Rover,
the British car manufacturer, which has been negotiating to set up an
assembly plant in Bulgaria for three years.
With much confusion over responsibility for reform and delays in privatising
state firms, often the biggest challenge for a foreign investor is finding a
Bulgarian party prepared to take business decisions, says Mr Andrew
Kenningham, director of the Bulgarian International Business Association,
which represents western investors including British Gas, Rank Xerox and the
Bulgarian-American Enterprise Fund.
'Foreign companies are frequently passed like a ball between the
privatisation agency, the ministries and the enterprise they are interested
in, with no one prepared to execute a deal,' he says.
The recession in western Europe and the business climate in central European
ex-communist countries have kept investors away, says Mr Konstantinos
Livadas, a consultant who represents Delta, a Greek food manufacturer which
has invested Dollars 3.5m in a distribution network and ice cream factory at
Varna.
In spite of his disappointment at Bulgaria's slow pace of change, Mr Livadas
remains optimistic. 'The market is empty. Companies persistent enough to do
business here will find many opportunities.'
Infrastructure projects have encouraged western companies to form local
partnerships so as to carry out some of the work. Siemens, one of four
western firms which recently won a Dollars 230m contract to upgrade the
country's telecommunications network, has invested DM2m in a joint venture
with Incoms, the Bulgarian state communications company. 'It will produce
some of the digital switchboards for the modernisation project,' says Mr
Vladimir Bogdanov, head of Siemens' Sofia office.
But many believe foreign investment will pick up only if Bulgaria can reach
agreement over its Dollars 8.5bn debt to 300 London Club commercial banks.
'There are few large investments because foreign firms have difficulty in
raising capital for deals in Bulgaria. A resolution of the debt problem is
vital if banks are to open new credit lines,' says Mr Kenningham.
The government also needs to do more to attract investors, says Mr Livadas.
'Restrictions on land ownership by foreigners should be lifted. Tax holidays
for those involved in production would also help.'
Mr Kenningham agrees: 'Bulgaria can be very frustrating. There are many
opportunities here especially in agro-industries, electronics and light
industries. But many in positions of authority seem more interested in their
own business deals than in facilitating foreign investment.'

FT  05 MAY 93 / Survey of Bulgaria (4): Struggle to cut debt - Anthony
Robinson meets a key negotiator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEBT reduction is crucial to Bulgaria's future economic growth and political
stability. So the government has put the responsibility for carrying out
debt negotiations with both the Paris and London creditor clubs in the hands
of Ms Mariana Todorova. She has joined Ms Hanna Suchocka, Poland's prime
minister, and Ms Hanna Gronkiewicz-Walz, the governor of Poland's central
bank, in that small group of high-powered women decision makers who have
emerged in former communist Europe.
Her combination of charm, intelligence and toughness will soon be focused on
foreign commercial bankers, who hold the bulk of Bulgaria's total Dollars
10.96bn foreign debt, when the negotiators and their London Club bank
creditors, led by Deutsche Bank, meet in Frankfurt later this month.
At issue is the Dollars 8.5bn owed to a group of more than 300 foreign
banks, most of it accumulated over the last five years of the Zhivkov
regime. During this period the communist government borrowed heavily both to
service its existing debt and to pay for the import of components and
equipment. Much of the imported components were then incorporated in goods
which were exported to the former Soviet Union for soft roubles or sent to
slow-paying countries such as Iraq, which still owes Bulgaria Dollars 2bn.
Large-scale borrowing, amounting to Dollars 1,200 a head, helped to prop up
the Zhivkov regime and disguise the declining competitiveness of the economy
since the mid-1970s. The loans were provided mainly by European and Japanese
banks on the assumption that the former Soviet Union stood in the background
as lender of last resort to its former satellites.
That illusion was smashed in 1990 when the Socialist party (communist)
government, faced with the need to repay over Dollars 3bn in capital and
interest, first stopped interest payment and then capital repayment. By that
time the Soviet Union was in no position to bail out anybody.
'There was no alternative to declaring a debt moratorium,' says Ms Todorova
who, as a senior research fellow at the Institute for International
Relations in Sofia, had been compiling facts on the debt situation and knew
that the refusal of western banks to roll over credits made default
inevitable.
Since then, however, Bulgaria has been cut off from access to international
capital markets and has had to rely on financing from the International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank and aid sources such as the European Community
Phare Fund.
The first step towards normalising financial relations came with last year's
rescheduling agreement for the Dollars 1.8bn Paris Club debt. This provided
for no debt reduction but a seven-year capital repayment grace period
followed by repayment over four years. In return, Bulgaria started repaying
interest totalling Dollars 74m since March 1992. But previous meetings with
the London Club left both sides far apart. The Bulgarian side proposed 75
per cent debt reduction while the banks counter-offered with a proposal for
a 38 per cent cut.
In this month's London Club negotiations in Frankfurt Ms Todorova will be
seeking a Brady-type debt relief with big reductions in both capital and
interest obligations. Technically, Bulgaria will offer a full menu of
possibilities - including discount bonds, par bonds, front-loaded interest
reduction bonds, debt-equity swaps and buy-backs.
'All the countries of eastern Europe are different and their treatment
should reflect this as in Latin America where the case-by-case approach has
been applied,' Ms Todorova argues.
Given the parlous state of an economy whose GDP has virtually halved over
the last three years and whose hard currency earning potential is severely
limited, Ms Todorova appears most interested in reaching agreement on debt
buy-back. She quotes the example of Costa Rica which, with help from the
Inter American Bank, was allowed to extinguish its debt by buying back at a
discount of 78 per cent.
Bulgarian debt is currently priced on the secondary market at 16 to 20 per
cent of face value. Many smaller creditor banks have already offloaded their
Bulgarian debt in this way. But it is far from clear that other banks, which
also face demands for a 50 per cent reduction in Poland's commercial bank
debt, will be ready to write off so much of their Bulgarian book as the
price of their previous imprudence.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Survey of Bulgaria (1): Re-emerging - if slowly - The
private sector is re-emerging from the rubble of the planned economy, but
already the government is being criticised for slow progress on reforms. The
country's importance in the Balkans has been underestimated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bulgaria's importance as a stable, reforming country in the heart of the
Balkans has tended to be undervalued. This may be about to change as it
builds the political and economic institutions needed to consolidate the
progress made to date in transforming what used to be one of the most
orthodox of the Soviet satellite states.
As in Bosnia, the legacy of Ottoman rule includes several Moslem minorities,
including Pomaks, who are ethnic Bulgars converted to Islam, and ethnic
Turks. But Bulgaria has managed to avoid the ethnic conflicts of
neighbouring Yugoslavia. Nor has its economy been engulfed by
hyper-inflation, even though, before the collapse of Comecon, Bulgaria was
the most closely linked to the former Soviet market. Its currency, the leva,
has also been stable for the past two years, and a private sector is
re-emerging from the rubble of the planned economy.
It would be a mistake, however, to take Bulgaria's contribution to
maintaining the stability of a historically fractious region for granted.
Bulgaria and Serbia have fought three wars over Macedonia in the last
century and a spill-over of the current Bosnian war into Kosovo or the newly
recognised former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia would almost inevitably
involve Bulgaria and the two historic rivals on its southern flank, Greece
and Turkey.
That could lead to a tragedy of incalculable dimensions which, Bulgarians
are convinced, would not only inflame the Balkans but have repercussions
throughout the continent. That is why President Zhelu Zhelyev, while calling
on the UN, the EC, Nato and other institutions to intervene militarily if
necessary to stop the fighting in Bosnia, insists that neither Bulgaria nor
any other Balkan state should get involved in the Yugoslav imbroglio. 'To do
so would risk claims and counter-claims of irredentism,' he says in
recognition of the conflicting historical claims to territory and peoples
which bedevil the region.
External risks aside, however, Bulgaria's strenuous efforts to rebuild on
market principles an economy gravely distorted by decades of reliance on
cheap Soviet energy and raw materials for its industry and on Comecon
markets for 80 per cent of its foreign trade, are stretching the capacity of
the country's inexperienced politicians and the patience of an electorate
confused by five governments in three years.
Since the end of last year Bulgaria has been ruled by a government of
technocrats. It is headed by Mr Lyuben Berov and supported by an odd
coalition of former communists, ethnic Turks and breakaway rebels from the
anti-communist Union of Democratic Forces.
Mr Berov, a 67-year-old former university professor, took up the reins
dropped by Mr Filip Dimitrov after the UDF government, elected with a small
majority at the October 1991 general elections, collapsed. The UDF, a
broad-ranging umbrella movement united by anti-communism but little else,
was riven by internal dissension. Its last months were accompanied by
growing differences between President Zhelyev, one of the UDF's founders,
and Mr Dimitrov, whom he accused of incompetence and insensitivity to the
pain which the government's economic and social policies were causing the
majority of the country's 8.5m people.
In practice, the margin for alleviating pain is small. Bulgaria was saddled
with an Dollars 11bn foreign debt by the previous communist regime led by
Todor Zhivkov and is required by the International Monetary Fund to keep
this year's budget deficit to 7.9 per cent of GDP to qualify for a new
standby agreement. This, in turn, is needed if Bulgaria is successfully to
renegotiate its Dollars 8.5bn debt to the London Club of commercial bank
creditors. Negotiations are due to resume in Frankfurt later this month.
Faced with unemployment expected to rise to 17 per cent by the end of the
year, an ageing population with 2.4m pensioners and a brain drain of the
economically active, the government has been able to do little more than
increase credit subsidies for newly privatised small farmers and allocate
funds for badly needed safety improvements on the railways. Later this year
it hopes to introduce VAT and other tax reforms to raise revenue and target
more effectively the emerging private sector.
Its main problems are the government's lack of a solid political base and
popular disillusionment after three very tough years in which most people
have lost the security but also the predictability of a communist regime.
Regained freedoms and wider choices are still cherished. But ordinary
Bulgarians are finding it increasingly hard to get visas from western
embassies to travel and falling incomes have kept newly available imported
goods out of reach, except for a minority of new entrepreneurs, many of them
closely connected with the former regime.
'It is not enough to be offered a form of economic Darwinism', says Mr
Georgy Pirinski, a former communist who is now a leading figure in the
social democratic wing of the Bulgarian Socialist party. 'We need an
industrial policy which will help us to restructure and save our
shipbuilding or engineering companies like Balkancar, as well as developing
the service industries and the private sector.'
As part of the coalition sustaining the government, the BSP, successor to
the communist party, is again able to influence policies from within. For
UDF politicians, such as Mr Ivan Kostov, the former finance minister, and
many ordinary Bulgarians, the continuing influence of the former communist
nomenklatura is one of the main reasons for the slow progress of structural
reforms and privatisation.
Although only in power for 100 days, the government is already being
criticised for failing to improve on the slow progress towards privatisation
and the delayed introduction of vital banking and other legislation of
previous governments. Old habits and the power of old connections
undoubtedly play a part in holding up reforms. But the delay also reflects
the difficulty of recruiting and keeping skilled and experienced personnel
in the face of competition from the private sector and the exodus of many of
Bulgaria's better educated younger people.
Bulgaria had been losing competitiveness for 15 years before the communist
regime collapsed and industrial output has dropped by 50 per cent over the
last three years alone. Without more foreign investment and freer access to
EC markets in particular, it will be virtually impossible for Bulgaria to
modernise its economy and develop a stabilising middle class by its own
efforts alone.
Whether such assistance is forthcoming depends as much on western Europe's
ability to re-assess the importance of maintaining stability in the Balkans,
as on Bulgaria's own continuing efforts to throw off the legacy of the last
four decades and establish itself as a modern, moderately prosperous
democracy.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Survey of Bulgaria (2): Next year may see recovery - The
Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY economy that manages to survive the wrenching changes suffered by
Bulgaria over the last three years must have a brighter future than meets
the eye. This is the thought which sustains the country's economic managers
and ordinary citizens as they slog through the fourth year of a painful
readjustment that, on the basis of incomplete official statistics, has
halved industrial output and reduced GDP per capita to a mere Dollars 980 a
year.
The assumption in this year's budget is of a further 3-4 per cent decline in
GDP in 1993, accompanied by at least 60 per cent inflation and a further
rise in unemployment to about 17 per cent by the end of the year.
Independent economists expect inflation to remain around last year's 80 per
cent level given the 18 per cent rise over the first quarter and the
prospect of further inflationary surges with the reduction in energy
subsidies planned for May and the introduction of VAT later this year.
If all goes well, however, and that includes no extension of the Bosnian war
to the wider Balkan arena and reasonable domestic political stability, the
economy should start a slow but accelerating recovery early in 1994.
Getting back onto a sustainable growth path depends largely on the
government's ability to push this year's budget through a fractious
parliament with its 7.9 per cent of GDP budget deficit ceiling intact. But
it also requires pressing ahead with privatisation, tax reform and
modernisation of the banking and financial sectors.
Progress on all these fronts is required if the International Monetary Fund
is to sign a new standby agreement. Such a signal of support from the IMF is
needed to reassure potential investors and help smooth the path towards a
debt reduction agreement with the London Club of commercial bank creditors
to whom Bulgaria owes Dollars 8.5bn of the total Dollars 11bn foreign debt
run up during the final years of the communist regime.
As the OECD noted in its first economic assessment of Bulgaria last year:
'External debt is the sword of Damocles hanging over the Bulgarian economy.'
Over the medium term, it added: 'Bulgaria will attract official capital
inflows, foreign investment and trade credit only if a satisfactory solution
to the problem of external debt is found.'
Since reneging on its debts in 1990 Bulgaria, the former Soviet bloc country
most dependent on trade with its Comecon partners, has been deprived of
access to normal bank finance and unable to attract more than a minuscule
amount of foreign investment.
Unofficial estimates put total foreign investment over the last three years
at around Dollars 100m, compared to the Dollars 5bn which has flowed into
Hungary over this period. But substantial involvement by the World Bank, the
IMF and other international institutions has led to the drawing up of
substantial sectoral modernisation plans for key sectors such as
telecommunications, nuclear safety and environmental protection.
At last month's European Bank for Reconstruction and Development conference
in London, improving the safety of the Kozloduy nuclear power complex was
singled out as the first project for the recently formed nuclear safety
facility.
The prospect of substantial funding for infrastructure and development
projects is starting to attract international companies. Siemens and
Alcatel, for instance, are expected to set up new production facilities in
Bulgaria. The country has a skilled electronics workforce but its domestic
industry, heavily oriented on exports to the Soviet Union, virtually
collapsed with the demise of Comecon.
Good prospects for oil and gas prospecting in the east of the country and
the Black Sea shelf have also lured British Gas, Texaco and other western
energy companies while Rover of the UK has joined Greek and Turkish
companies attracted not only by growth prospects in the 8.5m-strong domestic
market but Bulgaria's long-standing trading contacts with the former Soviet
Union and its membership of the recently-established Black Sea economic zone
which includes Turkey and several of the former Soviet states.
In March, Bulgaria signed a free trade agreement with Efta and an
association agreement with the European Community which should facilitate
the further re-orientation of Bulgarian trade to western markets. But the EC
accords leave much to be desired, with special protocols still to be
finalised covering sensitive sectors such as textiles, food and steel while
wine, one of the few export success stories, is excluded from the
arrangement.
Even so, the latest agreements are welcome in a country which until 1989
conducted nearly 80 per cent of its trade with the socialist bloc and which
is being forced to re-orientate its trade not only westward but also south
and east to Greece, its EC neighbour, and above all to Turkey and the Middle
East.
Such a shift has been accompanied by much pain. Whole swathes of Bulgarian
industry, initially built up with Soviet subsidies and equipment to serve
the Soviet market, have been decimated. Giant chemical, metallurgical,
engineering and electronics plants were deprived of their traditional
markets overnight and, in the case of the electronics sector in particular,
revealed as hopelessly obsolescent in the face of competition from
south-east Asia.
The same is true for the farming sector, which has been doubly hit both by
the disappearance of the former inexhaustible Soviet demand for cheap wine,
grain and processed foods and by a chaotic process of land restitution and
privatisation.
Longer term, the shift to market mechanisms and modernisation of its
agro-industry should make much better use of the country's fertile land and
clement climate.
Meanwhile, the 50 per cent decline in industrial output, painful though it
is, has exposed the nature of the old centrally-planned economy with its
enforced dependence on Soviet raw materials and markets. The shift to a less
energy-intensive and more productive economy based on service industries,
light engineering, tourism and a modernised agro-industrial sector has
started.
The private sector, concentrated initially in trading and services, has not
yet filled the gap left by the collapse of state industry. But its share has
risen from around 5 per cent to an estimated 20-25 per cent of an overall
lower GDP.
Times are still hard but an economic transformation is under way in Bulgaria
which mirrors, with a time lag, the reforms that have already changed the
face of central Europe.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Survey of Bulgaria (3): Getting paid is a high priority /
Profile of an entrepreneur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE MANY budding entrepreneurs in eastern Europe, Mr Ljubomir Gibinsky, the
brains behind Prime Investment Trust Holding, one of Bulgaria's fastest
growing private banking and invest- ment groups, made his first million as a
money changer, write Anthony Robinson and Virginia Marsh.
Last year the group's banks, newspapers, consulting services, tourism and
money changing activities reported a turnover of Lv25bn (about Dollars 1bn),
according to the former philosophy and political science lecturer from
Plovdiv, Bulgaria's ancient second city.
For four years the portly, pale-faced capitalist with a goatee beard and
long, manicured nails has hardly had a day off. Indeed, he has not left
Bulgaria. Last month he picked up a new passport in order to accompany Mr
Lyuben Berov, the prime minister, to Moscow on a trade mission designed to
revive trade and settle Moscow's outstanding debt.
'Business in eastern Europe is all about assuring payment,' comments Mr
Gibinsky who, like many Bulgarian intell- ectuals, spent years studying in
Russia, in his case at Moscow State university.
The high priority he attaches to getting paid also applies at home where
collecting overdue payments on behalf of indebted state companies and other
clients forms a substantial part of his business. 'Bulgarian companies are
being strangled by debt. We help to keep them afloat and advise them on
privatisation,' he says.
Among his clients is one of Bulgaria's biggest steel and engineering
companies whose management has been approached by foreign companies such as
ABB, the Swiss-Swedish power engin- eering group, Mannesmann of Germany and
Kobe of Japan, which, he believes, want to buy the company in order to close
it down.
'If we can keep this company afloat for two years it could become the best
machine building factory in the Balkans. It can make castings of up to 80
tonnes, but is only working at 20 per cent capacity. If we allow it to be
strangled by debt now, it will go under,' he believes. 'I'm not a
nationalist but we have to protect our future and the jobs of thousands of
Bulgarians are at stake,' he adds.
Mr Gibinsky sees his function as that of a home-grown merchant banker,
helping to rationalise the Bulgarian economy. To many ordinary Bulgarians,
crushed by rising prices and unemployment, he and his four partners - a
doctor, a physicist, an economist and a driver - reflect the unlikely
background of Bulgaria's budding entrepreneurial class.
With their silver Mercedes and smart suits they now look to many Bulgarians
like the capitalist sharks they were warned about in their socialist
schooldays.
Mr Gibinsky lives in a house opposite Sofia jail. 'People used to say that I
now live opposite the jail, but in a few years time I'll be living opposite
my house,' he says with a rueful shrug of his shoulders at the enduring
conservatism of his compatriots and the suspicion which accompanies new
wealth.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Espy finds emergency funding
for Dollars 700m of food aid for Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR MIKE Espy, the US agriculture secretary, juggled his budget over the
weekend and found emergency funding that will allow Dollars 700m worth of in
food aid to be shipped to Russia.
The aid, part of a Dollars 900m food package promised by US President Bill
Clinton to Russia at the Vancouver summit meeting, had been stalled by a
dispute over freight costs. Mr. Espy, after meeting with a delegation of
Russian officials in Washington last week, agreed to pay the freight
differential between foreign flag ships and much higher-cost US flag
vessels. US law requires that 75 per cent of US food aid be shipped in US
registered vessels.
The compromise will divert an estimated Dollars 385m from other areas of the
US Department of Agriculture's budget and will allow Russia to pay only the
world market rates for freight. It will also appease the US maritime unions,
which have a strong political base in Washington.
As a result, Russia has agreed to take the Dollars 700m in concessionary
loans under the Clinton package. Of the total, about Dollars 500m will be
used to purchase commodities and the remainder of about Dollars 200m will be
used pay for shipping.
Russian grain buyers have agreed to purchase Dollars 227.5m worth of US
maize, Dollars 105m worth of soyabean meal, Dollars 66.5m worth of butter,
Dollars 56m worth of wheat, Dollars 40m worth of vegetable oils, peanuts,
poultry, and rice and Dollars 5m worth of sugar.
Some Dollars 54.4m worth of the butter and Dollars 12m worth of the wheat
requirements will come from donation programmes rather than loans, the USDA
said.
US commodity traders said yesterday that the amounts of commodities involved
in the package had been anticipated in the market and that the news had
failed to rally grain prices at the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's
biggest agricultural futures market. The traders have already turned their
attention to the fields of the Midwest, where new-crop wheat is flourishing
and maize plantings, although running behind schedule, are benefitting from
a plentiful supply of moisture. Soyabean prices in Chicago were under
pressure from rumours of a larger crop in Brazil.

GOLD was fixed at a fresh nine-month high of Dollars 356.15 a troy ounce on
the London bullion market in the afternoon. After a quiet morning, the
market rebounded when US investment funds took advantage of a weaker US
dollar to buy gold on Comex. However, profit taking emerged, and London
closed at Dollars 354.70, down Dollars 1.05. At midday Comex prices were
mixed. 'The markets are overbought. We took them as high as they could go
before bumping into resistance,' said one New York analyst. COPPER trading
was erratic on the LME, with the market falling to fresh session lows in the
afternoon before recovering some of the losses. Dealers said losses in New
York were instrumental in pushing three-month metal below Dollars 1,850 a
tonne against a background of poor US economic leading indicators data.
Comex copper futures touched lifetime lows mid-morning. London's robusta
COFFEE futures finished with losses of up to Dollars 17 a tonne as prices in
New York arabica futures tumbled on widespread profit taking. The New York
trade was expecting a decrease in US certified stocks, which increased by
about 15,000 bags.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: The 'fantasy-land economics' of
Russian coal - The problems dogging the latest victim of the country's
industrial crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR VLADIMIR Iorikh, the youthful commercial director of the Kuznetsk coal
trading company, sat in his office in the grimy Siberian mining town of
Novokuznetsk and scribbled some sums on a piece of paper. 'It's impossible
to work out the real price of coal in Russia - it's fantasy-land economics,'
he said with a despairing chuckle.
For Russia's huge mining community, though, the better analogy might be a
nightmare. For decades after earning its image as an epitome of Soviet
industrial might, Russia's mining sector is now finding itself the latest
victim of the country's industrial crisis.
Earlier this month the Russian energy ministry announced that coal
production in the federation had fallen by almost 25 per cent in the last
three years, from 416m tonnes to 328m tonnes. At the same time, government
subsidies to the industry have shot up to 1.3bn roubles a year, according to
last month's calculations - or 6 per cent of the total Russian budget.
Meanwhile, with two thirds of the coal mines estimated to be in need of
urgent infrastructural investment, accidents in some areas increased by 30
per cent last year.
'It is a very serious situation indeed - it is worse than any other energy
sector,' said Mr Yuri Shafranik, Russian energy minister, as he announced
plans to close some mines by the end of the year.
To a certain extent the reasons behind this decline are rooted in the
familiar litany of Russia's industrial woes. Located on some of richest coal
seams in the world, between the 1940s and 1970s the Soviet government
developed thousands of mines - and mining towns - in regions like the
Siberian Kuzbass, to feed both local industry and far flung enterprises and
power stations across the Soviet Union.
But with the overall decline of Russia's industry, coupled with the
breakdown of the Soviet trading structure and reduced demand for coal on
world markets, the mines have been finding increasing difficulty in selling
their coal. The result has been growing stockpiles at the mines, spiralling
debts across the sector, and a dramatic fall in infrastructural investment
which, in turn, has left the mines increasingly dangerous and unproductive.
'The problem is that there is not a very great demand for our coal,'
explained Mr Iorikh, who estimated that because of falling demand up to a
fifth of the mines in the Kuzbass area would have to close, with the
potential loss of thousands of mining jobs.
But in addition to Russia's overall industrial decline, the disgruntled
Kuzbass mine leaders argue that another factor has been at force in the
mining crisis - the government's pricing policy, which fixes the price of
coal sold to state enterprises at levels that the mines call 'fantasy-land'
prices.
'The price is so low that we cannot possibly be profitable,' said Mr
Vladimir Lavrik, director of the Abashevskaya mine in the Kuzbass. According
to his calculations, the mines received between Rbs4,000 and Rbs7,000 a
tonne. Although the government was supposed to top this up with subsidies,
these were irregular and did not cover production costs. In the past year
alone the Abashevskaya mine ran up Rbs800m of bank credits and unpaid debts
to other enterprises, as well as a 100,000-tonne stockpile of coal it cannot
sell.
'We cannot buy any equipment because we use all our money for wages, and so
the situation gets worse and worse,' added Mr Lavrik. Although a recent
government decree had turned most mines in the area into nominal
shareholding companies, in which the government held a 38 per cent stake, Mr
Lavrik claimed that because of continuing government control over the
industry he was not yet able to contemplate the other potential solution - a
radical reduction in his 4000 strong workforce, and a cut in the miner's
wage, among the highest in Russia.
For the moment, most mines are attempting to survive by selling as much coal
as possible outside state structures and seeking export markets. In the
Kuzbass region, for example, the old state bureaucracy that used to decide
coal deliveries has been replaced by a new profit-making coal trading
company, which has rights to trade coal abroad.
But although some 20 per cent of the region's coal was exported last year,
attempts to expand these exports have been dogged with difficulty, not least
because of Russia's badly overloaded transport system. Moving a tonne of
coal from the Kuzbass to Moscow now costs twice as much as the official
state price of coal, while spiralling transit costs at the Baltic and Far
Eastern ports have been undermining the low production price. At the same
time, poor quality control and deteriorating processing equipment have made
Russian coal less attractive to foreign buyers.
'Russian coal is potentially the cheapest coal in the world, but because the
coal preparation equipment is so bad it is also potentially the most
expensive coal,' said Mr Igor Shelechkov, a coal trader with the
British-Russian company Promtrans trading, who estimated that between 1991
and 1992 the price of Russian coal dropped by almost a third on world
markets, while exports fell from 25m tonnes to 15m tonnes.
Local leaders in the Kuzbass hope that foreign investment will provide one
solution to the investment problems. But though some Western entrepreneurs
have attempted to buy into local mines, the results so far have not been
encouraging - a pioneering Anglo-Soviet venture which invested in a Kuzbass
coal mine two years ago, for example, was largely abandoned after it became
bogged down in bitter recriminations of financial scams.
'The problem is that investing in a Russian mine would require huge sums of
money, with very little return for many years,' added Mr Shelechkov. And
with Russia's political situation remaining so volatile, irrespective of the
'fantasy land' economics, these seem to be risks that most international
mining companies would prefer not to take.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysian group to pull out of
tin mining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYSIA'S TIN industry, already suffering its worst production slump since
the second world war, has been dealt a body blow with the announcement that
Malaysia Mining Corporation, one of the country's biggest tin producers, is
pulling out of tin mining.
For years tin mining has been the core of MMC's activities and until
recently Malaysia was the world's largest producer of the metal.
The corporation has been producing a large part of the country's tin, but a
prolonged period of low prices, rising production costs and the depletion of
high grade tin reserves has forced the company finally to hang up its mining
helmet in Malaysia.
It announced the move along with its results at the weekend. After suffering
losses in its Malaysian mining division for the third successive year MMC
said it had little alternative but to cease its mining operations. Overall
company profits had fallen by 19 per cent to MDollars 42m (USDollars 16m)
last year.
The MMC results provided for a write off of MDollars 37m to close the
company's tin mines and a further MDollars 23m in investment write offs.
Last year Malaysia's production of tin-in-concentrates was 14,339 tonnes,
the lowest since 1946 and down from 20,710 tonnes in 1991. Mr Redzwan Sumun,
executive secretary of the Association of Tin Producing Countries, says that
as a result of MMC's move, Malaysia's tin output is likely to be halved over
the next year. 'I doubt the small mines can make up the slack,' he said.
MMC is only the latest tin operator to conclude that the industry in
Malaysia has a bleak future. In 1990 there were 141 tin mines in the
country. Now there are barely 50.
The critical year for MMC and the world tin industry was 1985 when the
International Tin Council's buffer stock operations collapsed and more than
100,000 tonnes of stockpiled tin came on to the market.
Ten years ago Malaysian tin was earning between MDollars 32 and MDollars 34
a kilogram; this week the price slumped to MDollars 14.
Malaysia, with its fast industrialising economy, is facing labour shortages
in many areas. Wages are rising and even the most efficient miners say tin
production costs are now at least MDollars 16 per kg.
China, Brazil, Indonesia and Bolivia - all of whom have lower wage costs and
more accessible tin deposits - have now overtaken Malaysia in the tin
production league.
MMC has successfully diversified out of its core business in Malaysia into
engineering and gold and diamond mining in Australia. But other smaller,
less well capitalised companies, have simply closed down operations and sold
their tin mining sites to be used for aquaculture, water sports, parks or
real estate.
This month the ATPC, which groups Malaysia, Indonesian, Australia, Bolivia,
Nigeria, Thailand and Zaire, is due to meet here to discuss the future of
the tin mining industry.
The association feels that two main factors are prolonging the slump in tin
prices: the absence from the market of the former Soviet Union, which at one
time was importing more than 20,000 tonnes of tin annually, and the
continued selling of tin stockpiles by the US Defence Logistics Agency.
Most producers feel that with more mines closing and world tin stocks being
gradually depleted, prices will rise. But MMC, along with many others, has
decided it can wait no longer. Mr Muhamad Nur Muhamad of the Malaysian
Chamber of Mines says there is as yet no indication that price trends are
being reversed.
'If prices and demand do not improve, it would be difficult for Malaysia's
mining sector to continue sustaining itself. More mines will have to shut
down,' he warns.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Loss of guarantee will cut UK
farmers' wool earnings in half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK SHEEP farmers face a reduction of almost half in their income from wool
following the demise of the British Wool Marketing Board's guarantee price
after 42 years.
Last year the wool price was guaranteed at 117p a kilogram. The market price
is about 64p - a marginal level for many farmers.
The government's termination of the guarantee scheme could not have come at
a worse time, Mr Alun Evans, chairman of the board, said yesterday. The
world wool industry had been plunged into crisis by overproduction in the
southern hemisphere and the recession.
But the board had been preparing for the end of the scheme under the
Agricultural Marketing Act and had cut its costs to the level of 13 years
ago at 23p a kilogram from 35p at the peak. Staffing had been cut from 160
to fewer than 60.
The BWMB will retain its statutory obligation to collect all the wool - 50m
kg - from the UK's 100,000 producers, including those in Northern Ireland
and the Western Isles. This is necessary because 60 per cent of producers
grow about 20 per cent of the total clip in amounts of 400 kg or less. The
wool is seen principally as a by-product of lamb production. 'In times like
these nobody would be likely to collect the wool from farmers, particularly
in the remote regions,' said Mr Evans.
The world market for wool, which is totally free, is depressed by huge
overhangs of stocks in Australia and New Zealand. Last week the Australian
government announced a 12-month moratorium on sales from the country's
3.9bn-bale stockpile in an attempt to end the slide in prices, which are at
historic lows.
The BWMB has retained Pounds 10m in order to be able to make what it called
a prudent downpayment on the coming clip, with the balance to be paid at the
end of the season. It intends to maintain this system in order to ensure a
smooth supply of wool.
Mr Donald Holdsworth, chairman of the British Wool Federation, which
represents the textile industry, said the smooth flow of wool to auction via
the BWMB had greatly benefited the industry, which last year exported Pounds
550m worth of goods.
The industry did not object to the removal of the guarantee scheme, but it
did object to the timing, said Mr Holdsworth. In West Yorkshire more than
23,000 jobs depended on the wool industry.
Both the Federation and the BWMB had tried to get the government to continue
a modified guarantee scheme, or to phase it out over several years, to
soften the blow. The BWMB estimated that over its 42-year life the guarantee
price had cost the government between Pounds 8m and Pounds 11m.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: Rally in UK gilts as prices increase by up
to half a point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK GOVERNMENT bond prices bounced by as much as half a point yesterday,
prompting suggestions that the market had fallen too far in reaction to
early signs of economic recovery.
The gains came as the gilts market reopened after Monday's public holiday.
While bonds with maturities up to 10 years rose by between a quarter and a
third of a point, the biggest gains came in the longest-dated issues,
implying that the buying was driven by UK institutions rather than foreign
investors. This helped to reverse part of the steepening of the UK yield
curve apparent in recent weeks.
Ten-year bond yields had risen by around 40 basis points during April, half
of that in the last week, pushing up the yield spread over German government
bonds to nearly 150 basis points.
Yesterday's move was 'largely a technical response' to this price fall,
demonstrating that underlying demand for gilts remained firm, said Mr Simon
Briscoe, an economist at Greenwell Montagu.
The June long gilts future contract ended the day at around 104 3/16 , up
from 103 31/32 , on moderate volume of nearly 30,000 contracts traded.
GERMAN government bonds also rose after last week's losses, although traders
and economists generally remained pessimistic about the prospects for
long-dated bunds in the weeks ahead.
The positive mood in the market yesterday was due in part to the
announcement that DM3bn of 10-year federal government bonds with a new
coupon of 6.75 per cent had been sold, in line with market expectations. A
similar amount is expected to be sold at auction today.
Economic data in the next few days, including unemployment figures by the
end of the week, are expected to give further support to the market in the
short term.
The Bundesbank is also generally expected to use today's sale of repurchase
agreements to shave a further 5 to 10 basis points off the key official
money market rate, lending further support to the market.
However, yesterday's moves did not shake the widely-held belief that
longer-dated bunds could lose ground in the coming weeks, and that
shorter-dated paper offers the best opportunity for gains.
The June bund futures contract on Liffe ended the day close to where it
began, at 94.80, having lost ground to 94.56 at one stage.
MOST other European bond markets continued to outperform the bund market,
repeating last week's experience, as investors were reported to be
continuing to look to switch from Germany into higher-yielding markets.
Ten-year French bonds gained a quarter of a point, even though the June
'notionnel' futures contract ended the day down at 117.24 from 117.36 on
nearly 140,000 contracts.
Italian bonds gained a third and Spanish bonds a half, with Scandinavian
markets also benefiting from the repositioning away from the D-Mark.
US TREASURY prices rose sharply at the long end yesterday as speculation
intensified about the outcome of the Treasury's study into the debt mix,
which is due later today.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  25/32 at 104
1/4 , yielding 6.787 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was unchanged at 100 1/4 , to yield 3.727 per cent.
Trading was thin throughout the day as the market awaited news of the
Treasury's study into whether it should reduce future issues of the long
bond and increase issues of shorter-dated paper. The moves would be made to
cut the government's interest costs.
There was considerable speculation yesterday about the findings of the
debt-mix study, including suggestions that the Treasury might scrap some
issues of the 30-year bonds. Prices rose strongly yesterday afternoon after
the Treasury announced plans to issue more bills in its weekly auctions, a
move that dealers assumed meant issuance of the long bond would be cut
substantially.

FT  05 MAY 93 / International Bonds: Kingdom of Spain joins French franc
borrowers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE KINGDOM of Spain launched its long-awaited Eurobond yesterday, joining
the ranks of recent borrowers in the French franc sector with a FFr6bn,
15-year issue.
Spain tapped the international capital markets with a DM4bn 10-year Eurobond
issue earlier this year, and was keen to return to the Euromarkets with
another big - but longer-dated - issue at a low yield.
It had considered both the Eurofranc and the Eurosterling markets as
suitable for the launch of longer-dated bonds, and eventually chose the
Eurofranc sector because it does not expect long-dated yields to fall much
further over the next few months.
The proceeds of the issue will be used to fund the budget deficit. The issue
has a coupon of 7.5 per cent and was priced to yield 44 basis points over
the 8 1/2 per cent OAT due 2008.
The deal broke syndicate late in the afternoon and held its 44 basis point
yield spread, according to CCF, lead manager and book-runner for the deal.
Other syndicates pointed out that the deal was launched too late in the day
to get a clear idea of how well it had been received, and market
participants are likely to keep a close watch on the offering in trading
today.
One syndicate manager noted that Spain may have missed out on the recent
bull run in the French franc sector. Several borrowers have tapped this area
of the market in the first quarter. 'Investor interest in this area is less
than it was in the first three months, ahead of the (French) election,' said
one house involved in the deal.
The bonds are likely to be sold predominantly to European investors. The
lead manager priced the deal with recent long-dated Eurofranc issues from
EDF and SNCF in mind: these borrowers launched bonds at yield spreads of
around 33 and 34 basis points respectively.
Credit Lyonnais, one of the joint lead managers, said the Kingdom of
Sweden's recent French franc deal also provided an indication for pricing
the Spanish deal, given that it is a similar credit.
Spain has indicated that it would like to tap the Eurobond market with large
issues three or four times a year. Mr Federico Ferrer, deputy
director-general of foreign financing at the Spanish treasury, said
yesterday: 'We may do one more Eurobond issue this year.'
The Kingdom of Spain's issue provided the main talking point in the market,
although there were a handful of other deals, including two further collared
floating-rate notes - a Dollars 150m, 10-year deal from CSFB Finance and a
Dollars 100m 10-year deal from Goldman Sachs Group.
The market also saw the launch of an unusual Pibs (permanent interest
bearing shares) issue from First National Building Society.
This is the first building society to raise capital in more than one
currency, as the issue consisted of a IPounds 30m tranche and a Pounds 20m
portion.
Cementos Mexicanos, the world's fourth-largest cement company, is poised to
issue some Dollars 500m in debt in international markets, adds Damian Fraser
in Mexico City. It will use the proceeds to help repay a Dollars 600m
bridging loan it took out last year when buying Sanson and Valenciana, the
Spanish cement companies.

FT  05 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Italy tops performance tables
with 2.82% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S higher-yielding government bond markets, led by Italy, topped the
performance tables in April as the Bundesbank cut German interest rates and
paved the way for other European central banks to follow suit.
Italy (up 2.82 per cent), Denmark (up 2.24 per cent) and Sweden (up 2.18 per
cent) were the top-performing government bond markets in local currency
terms last month, according to figures compiled by JP Morgan Securities.
Pressure on the French franc has subsided since the general election. Cuts
in German, French and other European interest rates - reflecting concerns
about the recessionary environment within Europe - have helped to ease
tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism.
The worst-performing market over the month was the UK, which fell 1.36 per
cent as news of a rise in GDP confirmed recent indications of a recovery in
the UK economy.
In the past 12 months, the top-performing markets have been Australia (up
18.06 per cent), the Netherlands (up 17.58 per cent) and France (up 17.13
per cent) in local currency terms. For dollar-based investors, Italy was
still the top-performing market last month with a gain of 9.76 per cent,
followed by Sweden (up 8.08 per cent). However, over the past 12 months,
Japan has provided the highest returns in US dollar terms, with a gain of
34.38 per cent.

FT  05 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: 'Notionnel' set to give
further boost to Globex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE addition of the French government bond contract is expected to provide a
further boost to trading on Globex, the after-hours electronic trading
system, when it starts next month.
The contract, on the so-called 'notionnel' bond, is set to begin on Globex
on May 13.
The 'notionnel' is the second most widely traded bond future in the world,
after the CBOT's US Treasury bond future.
The Globex system is jointly owned by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the
Chicago Board of Trade and Reuters.
Globex volume, which had been lagging since the launch last June, more than
doubled when Matif listed two lesser contracts in March.
During April, Globex volume was 135,681 contracts, with Matif 3-month Pibor
contracts and Ecu bonds representing 81, 120 or 60 per cent of the total.
Matif's 'notionnel' bond future had been scheduled to begin trading on
Globex in March, but a series of intermittent system failures delayed its
launch.
The 'notionnel' traded a daily average of 16,628 contracts on the French
exchange's own post-market trading system last year, and exchange officials
expect all that volume to transfer to Globex. That would be much more than
the CBOT's US Treasury bond Globex trade, which hovers around 1,000
contracts a session.
Matif also plans to list its CAC-40 stock index future on Globex before the
end of May. It will be the first equity index derivative to be listed on the
trading system.
Matif's overall volume in April was 5.1m contracts, an increase of 57 per
cent over April 1992.
Last month the exchange reported net income, after tax, of FFr143m for 1992,
up from FFr91m in 1991.
That raised the exchange's reserves, after dividend payments, to FFr698m.

FT  05 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: SEC widens debate on
derivatives regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday voted to ask for public
comment on whether it should broaden the capital requirements for securities
firms to include their exposure to derivative securities.
The move is the latest expression of concern by US and international
regulators about the fast-growing, extremely profitable and largely
unregulated market for derivative instruments such as forwards and swaps.
Only last week, the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision proposed new
minimum capital levels for banks which trade equities, debt, foreign
exchange and derivatives.
The SEC is at this stage only seeking comment on ways in which it could
change its capital rules to encompass derivatives, but any eventual action
could have serious repercussions for the market.
The SEC only gained the power to oversee the derivates business last year
when, following the 1990 collapse of securities house Drexel Burnham
Lambert, it won the right examine the affiliates of securities houses
dealing in the instruments.
The Basle proposals would require banks to use models which simulate market
volatility in order to gauge their reserve capital requirements.

FT  05 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Australia changes TV rules
again

   MELBOURNE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN government has again been forced to amend its policy on
subscription television, this time to contain embarrassment over the outcome
of last week's bidding round for the initial licences.
On Friday, the government awarded the first licences to operate satellite
subscription television to little-known companies UCOM and Hi Vision, which
bid ADollars 177m (USDollars 125m) and ADollars 212m respectively.
The companies won the bidding despite intense competition from larger
international consortia, notably a combination involving Mr Rupert Murdoch's
News Corporation and Mr Kerry Packer's Channel Nine television network.
This consortium, which included Telecom Australia, the government-owned
telecommunications carrier, was reported to have offered ADollars 70m. US
Continental Cable group is said to have bid ADollars 53m. The government
said it received a total of 50 separate bids for the two licences.
The decision to award the rights to the licences on a strictly 'highest
bidder' basis has stunned the Australian media industry, which had been
confident that one licence would be awarded to the Packer-Murdoch
consortium.
Under the rapidly-revised bidding rules, if UCOM or Hi Vision fail to put up
the cash involved in their bids, the tenders will be awarded to the next
highest bidders. This time, however, the winners will have to provide a
non-refundable 5 per cent deposit within three days.
Under the original rules, tenders had to be accompanied by ADollars 500. Bid
winners are now required to raise the bid amounts 30 days after getting
clearances from the Australian Broadcasting Authority and the Trade
Practices Commission, the competition regulator.
The process was widely criticised within the media industry yesterday for
allowing highly speculative bids from groups that did not have strong
financial backing or little or no enough experience in operating television
networks.
In a statement on Monday evening, Hi Vision said Philips Australia, GEC and
Marconi were likely participants in its licence. UCOM has not issued a
statement on its plans.
The government's change of tack is the latest in an 18-month saga of policy
lurches on pay-TV that includes battles within the Labor government and
opposition parties, lobbying by fearful TV networks and a court battle.
'However, potential deficiencies in the current arrangements have been noted
in recent days and it is desirable to provide a systemic solution for the
future in the allocation of broadcasting licences generally,' Mr Bob
Collins, transport and communications minister said.
The government has changed its pay-TV policy several times since the first
draft was published in November 1991. It opted for one exclusive licence,
then two, excluded the state broadcaster, and then guaranteed it two
channels, allowing non-satellite cable at the same time.

higher returns

US INVESTORS bought a record Dollars 51.5bn in foreign stocks and bonds last
year as institutions and individuals continued to look overseas to diversify
their portfolios and find higher returns.
In 1991, US investors bought Dollars 47bn of foreign securities.
In contrast, foreign investors were net sellers of US equity securities in
1992, selling Dollars 5.2bn of stocks over the 12 months.
In the previous year, overseas investors had been net buyers of US stocks.
US investors continued to prefer foreign stocks to bonds, said the
Securities Industry Association.
However, acquisitions of fixed-income securities grew faster than
acquisitions of stocks, the SIA said.
In total, US investors bought Dollars 32.1bn of foreign equities, and
Dollars 19.4bn of bonds.
As always, European markets were the main beneficiaries of US demand,
attracting a record Dollars 17bn in direct investment, the bulk of it
(Dollars 11.3bn) going into UK stocks.
Mr David Strongin, director of international finance at the SIA, said that
the UK's withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism, and a sharp
drop in UK interest rates, made UK equities look especially attractive to US
investors.
The busiest part of the year for US buying of foreign stocks was the final
quarter, which suggests that US investors saw the turmoil in European
currency and equity markets as a buying opportunity.
Asian markets received Dollars 8.9bn, of which about half went into Japan.
US investors bought more Japanese stocks last year than in 1991, an
indication that they believed the Tokyo market was heading for a recovery.
Interest in other Asian securities was particularly focused on Hong Kong.
US investors poured Dollars 2.8bn into the colony in the hope of taking
advantage of rapidly-growing Chinese stock markets.

FT  05 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Indonesia's Astra tumbles 61%

<TEXT>
ASTRA International, Indonesia's leading automotive company, reported a 61
per cent fall in net profits last year to Rp81.49bn (Dollars 39.3m),
including one-off disposal gains of Rp33bn, writes William Keeling in
Jakarta.
The figures, at the lower end of expectations, seal a turbulent year for the
company, which saw the founding Soeryadjaya family reduce its majority stake
in order to stave off personal bankruptcy.
A reduction in Astra's holding in United Tractors accounted for half the
disposals, but the company declined to reveal the identity of other sales.
Vehicle sales for the first three months of this year have fallen by 16 per
cent year-on-year, to 20,971.
Banks are renegotiating Astra's estimated Dollars 800m foreign debt. Brokers
estimate the company also has about Rp600bn in local debt and a Dollars 150m
convertible bond. Its net debt to equity ratio, not including the
convertible bond, rose from 110 per cent in 1991 to 140 per cent last year.
However, Astra has maintained its reputation as Indonesia's foremost
blue-chip stock, with a price to earnings ratio twice the local stock market
average.

Coles Myer, Australia's largest retailer, reported a solid increase in
third-quarter turnover and appeared to be heading for a strong sales
performance for the full year, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney.
Mr Peter Bartels, chief executive, said adjusted third-quarter sales had
risen 5 per cent to ADollars 3.54bn (USDollars 2.5bn), lifting sales for the
first nine months by 4.4 per cent to ADollars 11.46bn.
Mr Bartels said sales figures, which had been adjusted for last year's
disposal of some of the company's New Zealand interests, reflected a strong
performance, against an inflation rate of about 1 per cent.
'We are particularly pleased that the rate of sales increase has been
gathering momentum during the year despite the depressed economic
conditions,' he said.
'The continuing improvement in performance by two of our major businesses,
Coles Supermarkets and K mart, gives us confidence for a good full-year
result.'
*****
Burns, Philip &amp; Company, the Australian food technology and hardware group,
reported higher earnings and sales for the nine months to March, but
remained cautious about the full-year result, writes Bruce Jacques.
Nine-month net profits rose 22 per cent to ADollars 74.8m (USDollars 52.8m)
on a 17 per cent sales rise to ADollars 1.98bn. This was despite a static
third-quarter net profit of ADollars 20.3m.
Mr Andrew Turnbull, managing director, warned that the company traditionally
earned higher profits in its first half. He said the full-year result would
depend on the level of consumer confidence.
The food and fermentation division was the biggest earnings contributor,
lifting profit from ADollars 41.2m to ADollars 63.2m. Hardware division
profits rose from ADollars 12.2m to ADollars 13.8m.
*****
Australian National Industries, the engineering group, reports near static
net earnings of ADollars 38.6m for the nine months to March on a 2 per cent
sales increase to ADollars 878.3m, writes Bruce Jacques.

FT  05 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Tenaga Nasional beats market
expectations

<TEXT>
TENAGA Nasional, Malaysia's partially-privatised electricity utility,
reported pre-tax profits of MDollars 911m (USDollars 354m) for the six
months to February 1993, a 15 per cent increase over the same period last
year. Turnover improved to MDollars 2.4bn from MDollars 2.06bn.
The results were slightly above market expectations and reflect expanding
power sales in Malaysia's fast-growing economy.
Tenaga shares were heavily oversubscribed when the government sold some 25
per cent of the company a year ago. But it fell out of favour following a
series of power failures.
Tenaga said unexpectedly high demand and maintenance work had necessitated
load shedding in several areas. The company admits that adequate power
supplies might not be available for some months.
Analysts point out that demand for electricity is likely to continue to
expand. But any future large scale power failures might lead to the
government reorganising the company.
They also say that with more than 25 per cent of Tenaga's long-term loans
yen-denominated, the company is likely to be hit by the continued rise in
the value of the Japanese currency, which has appreciated 12 per cent
against the Malaysian dollar so far this year.

FT  05 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: First-term losses down
sharply at DnB

DEN NORSKE Bank, Norway's biggest commercial bank, yesterday reported a
sharp fall in first-quarter net losses to NKr138m (Dollars 20.5m) from
NKr601m, but warned that the persistent high level of credit losses and
non-performing loans made it far too early to declare an end to Norway's
six-year banking crisis.
Group net interest income rose by NKr91m to NKr1.23bn as other operating
income - from the share portfolio, foreign exchange and other financial
dealings - increased by NKr413m to NKr958m.
DnB accumulated NKr245m in unrealised gains in the first quarter which were
not included in the accounts. The gains came from an increase in the value
of its share and bond portfolios - NKr137m for shares and NKr107m for bonds
 -resulting from declining interest rates.
'The improvement in performance is thus greater than what appears in the
accounts,' said Mr Finn Hvistendahl, chief executive. Group operating
profit, before losses on loans and guarantees and write-downs on assets,
shot up by NKr591m to NKr1.06bn.
Losses on loans and guarantees increased by NKr153m to NKr1.17bn as the
non-performing loan portfolio has risen by NKr484m to NKr12.07bn since the
end of last year.
Loan losses at the London subsidiary remain high - up from NKr66m to NKr123m
for the quarter - and significantly impacted the level of overall group
credit losses.
The shipping loan portfolio had specified loan losses of NKr53m, against
NKr84m last year, but accounted for more than 50 per cent of unspecified
group loan losses of NKr170m. Group operating expenses were cut by NKr88m to
NKr1.132bn year-on-year.
'We have achieved a steady reduction of costs each year since 1988,' Mr
Hvistendahl pointed out. He said 121 full-time jobs had been cut in the
first quarter while staff had been reduced by 37 per cent in the last five
years to 6,185 at end-March.

FT  05 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Mixed results at South
African Breweries units

THE three retail and manufacturing subsidiaries in the South African
Breweries (SAB) group reported mixed results for the year to March, with
useful performances from Edgars and Lion Match counterbalanced by a R45m
(USDollars 14.3m) loss at OK Bazaars.
All three companies suffered from weak consumer spending. Tight financial
management helped Edgars and Lion Match overcome the difficult trading
environment, but OK Bazaars was held in check by radical restructuring.
Apart from the restructuring, which forced OK Bazaars to record a R40m
extraordinary loss, over and above the R45m trading loss, the group has
appointed a new managing director, Mr Mervyn Serebro.
Management said it was in the process of repositioning the group, but
expected further losses this year. A priority will be to improve OK Bazaars'
operating margin, which dropped to under 1 per cent last year with operating
profit slipping to R49.9m on a turnover of R5.3bn.
Edgars, the clothing, footwear and textiles group lifted attributable
earnings by 18 per cent to R186m (R157.5m). Edgars is the main non-beer
contributor to SAB's profits. The results testify to aggressive marketing
during the second half. First-half sales rose 9 per cent: they were 16 per
cent higher for the 53-week reporting period - at R3.2bn.
Margins were maintained, and with interest charges dipping, pre-tax profits
increased by 20 per cent to R361m. On a divisional basis, R145m of the R185m
attributable profit came from Edgars stores and R52m from Sales House while
Jet made a R2m loss. Both Sales House and Jet improved their performance by
over 70 per cent compared with 1992.
Mr George Beeton, managing director, predicted satisfactory growth in
earnings for the year ahead. The overall dividend for 1992-93 was 140 cents
a share, against 119 cents.
Attributable earnings at Lion Match (shaving equipment and packaging as well
as matches) increased by 22 per cent to R15.4m. The improvement reflected
significantly lower financing costs.

SAMSUNG Construction, South Korea's fourth-largest construction company, has
been banned from bidding on domestic construction projects for six months
for its role in the nation's worst train accident in March.
Samsung Construction, part of the Samsung group, is being blamed for the
accident, in which 78 people died.
The unusually tough penalty is a severe blow to Samsung Construction, which
is heavily dependent on domestic orders.
Samsung officials estimate that the construction company could lose between
Won700bn and Won1,000bn (Dollars 880m to Dollars 1.25bn) in orders this
year.
The company last year received total orders of Won1.6bn, of which only 12.5
per cent came from overseas.
Samsung Electronics has acquired Harris Microwave Semiconductor, a US
specialist in chemical compound computer chips. The deal is expected to help
Samsung expand its cordless telecommunications business.

FT  05 MAY 93 / International Company News: Iveco gambles high stakes on
future - Kevin Done examines the investment plans of Fiat's truck division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE stakes that Europe's hard-pressed truckmakers must gamble in order to
survive have become daunting. The weaker players are being swept aside by
recession.
As the European truck industry slides into a fourth year of retrenchment,
Iveco, the commercial vehicle division of Fiat of Italy, is reaching the
climax of a L5,000bn (Dollars 3.35bn), five-year investment programme aimed
at transforming its products and manufacturing operations.
With capital commitments on such a huge scale, the truck industry is not for
the faint-hearted. Iveco has been in loss for the past two years, as demand
for trucks across Europe has fallen sharply, but it must maintain this level
of investment to become one of the industry's elite.
Daf, the Dutch vehicle maker which collapsed into receivership in February,
is only the latest and most notable victim of the war of attrition that has
cut the number of European truckmakers from 25 in 1975 to 10. The number
shows every sign of falling further.
Iveco has managed to establish itself among the 'big three' of the European
truck industry, along with Mercedes-Benz of Germany and the Franco-Swedish
alliance of Renault and Volvo.
But it has had a tougher road to travel than any of its rivals. From a
limited base in Italy in the 1970s it has been forced to undertake an
ambitious series of acquisitions of some of Europe's weaker players. It has
shouldered an important part of the rationalisation and restructuring of
Europe's truck industry.
Iveco fell behind its rivals in the 1980s in developing new products. It was
distracted by the task of moulding disparate operations and corporate
cultures from France, Germany, Spain and the UK into a single, integrated
group, as well as creating a pan-European sales and marketing network.
It has mounted a formidable effort in the past five years to close the gap.
Each year, from 1988 to 1992, it has spent between 4 and 4.5 per cent of its
turnover, or about L350bn a year, on research and development for new
products. R&amp;D spending has totalled L1,706bn in the past five years. In the
same period, capital expenditure has been running at between 6.3 and 8.8 per
cent of turnover, or about L598bn a year, totalling L2,989bn.
The goal has been to transform Iveco from a national company with scattered
plants into a single, transnational company, firmly established in six
countries, and with production, design and engineering linked by common
systems and computer networks.
The launch this week in Turin of two new truck series, EuroStar, for
long-distance haulage, and EuroTrakker, for heavy off-road construction
work, marks the climax of the product renewal process.
But the series are hitting the market when the industry is 'struggling under
the grip of the most hostile economic environment for over 20 years',
according to DRI Europe, the London-based automotive analyst.
Iveco has suffered two years of losses, while rivals, such as Volvo and
Renault, are awash with red ink. Daf has crashed; Renault has given up truck
assembly in the UK; AWD, the British independent truckmaker that took over
the Bedford truck operations, collapsed into receivership; Mercedes-Benz has
abandoned its plan to build a truck plant in eastern Germany.
'Truck manufacturers and dealers in Europe are scrambling to survive the
most drawn-out recession in truck sales for more than two decades, which has
settled like a blanket of gloom over the entire truck market in western
Europe,' says Automotive Industry Data, the UK analyst.
When Iveco embarked on its transformation project in the mid-1980s, truck
producers were enjoying a four-year period of growth and profits, which
peaked with record volumes in 1989. It must now make investments pay in an
era when volumes and margins are under the severest pressure, and
competition is intense.
Iveco claims it has increased its competitiveness and expanded its global
presence through the integration of design, manufacturing, logistics and
marketing functions.
It now has centrally co-ordinated R&amp;D, manufacturing and distribution
facilities and is present in all the European markets. It has completed the
reorganisation of the manufacturing assignments of all its plants in Italy,
Spain, France, Germany and the UK.
So-called modular construction, a strategy pioneered by Scania, the Swedish
heavy truckmaker, to overcome its relative lack of size, became a guiding
principle for Iveco.
In 1987, its engineers working in three countries were given the task of
standardising all the essential sub-systems of a truck - cabs, axles,
engines, chassis frames and gearboxes - into basic modules. It has invested
8.2m hours of engineering into redesigning these five main sub-systems.
Manufacture of the 'modules' is concentrated in specialised centres in
Brescia, Bourbon-Lancy, Foggia and Turin. Assembly has been focused in
Brescia, Langley in the UK, Madrid and Valladolid in Spain and in Ulm,
Germany.
Iveco claims to have cut costs significantly. It has reduced its suppliers
from 2,000 to 700 as they switch from individual components to producing
sub-systems. According to Mr Giancarlo Boschetti, Iveco chief executive,
manufacturing rationalisation has allowed the company to reduce the number
of components by 20 per cent.
Standardised modules have made it possible to utilise in truck manufacture
the sort of automated techniques associated with volume car production, he
says.
The sweeping renewal of products and manufacturing processes has spread to
sales and marketing, says Mr Boschetti. Iveco salesmen will now have lap-top
computers to give them access to the catalogue of modules that make up the
product range.
'The salesman effectively develops the vehicle to fit the customer's needs,'
he adds.
Mr Boschetti admits that one priority is to invest in training for salesmen
to 'ensure the benefits reach the customer'. He says this is where the
battle-lines will be drawn between surviving truckmakers, as they all
achieve similar levels of efficiency.
But the revolution in sales and marketing is to be the next phase of Iveco's
corporate revolution. For the moment, rocked back like all its rivals by the
ferocity of the recession in the European truck market, Iveco is having to
take more tactical measures to stem the losses.
After only breaking even in 1990, and with losses of Fl 199m in 1991 and Fl
187m (Dollars 103.8m) in 1992 (Iveco is incorporated in the Netherlands), it
was forced to cut its workforce by 4,000, or nearly 10 per cent, in 1992.
This rationalisation has been led in the UK and in Spain, where its most
recent acquisitions, Iveco Ford Truck and Iveco Pegaso, have continued to
run up losses.
It is pouncing eagerly on the opportunity offered by the collapse of Daf to
try to recruit about one-fifth of the former Anglo-Dutch truck producer's
main dealers in the UK.
While markets shrink in Europe, Iveco is pushing to develop its presence in
Asia. Exports outside west Europe accounted for 19 per cent of its sales
volumes last year, compared with 13 per cent in 1989. It is establishing a
significant presence in India and China.
The key to Iveco's future, however, lies in delivering the promise of a
corporate transformation in Europe. Mr Boschetti claims Iveco has gone
through a 'corporate metamorphosis - a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis
after being a caterpillar'. The question is, how well the butterfly can fly?

<TEXT>
DYNO Industrier, the diversified Norwegian group, yesterday reported a
NKr11m increase in first-quarter pre-tax profit to NKr75m (Dollars 11.2m),
helped by a strong performance by the chemical division.
Dyno outperformed forecasts by domestic analysts, who had predicted pre-tax
profit of about NKr55m, but its shares closed NKr4 lower at NKr95 on the
Oslo bourse.
Group sales rose slightly to NKr1.91bn from NKr1.88bn as operating profit,
before financial items, rose by NKr14m to NKr118m.
The chemical division lifted first-quarter operating profit by NKr31m to
NKr76m, but sales remained unchanged at NKr544m. The explosives division saw
operating profit nearly halved to NKr31m from NKr60m, as sales rose by
NKr33m to NKr913m.
'The explosives group held steady in North America and Australia, while
European activities show a decline following a slump in the building
industry,' Dyno explained.
The plastics division saw operating profit fall by NKr10m to NKr20 as sales
dipped by NKr4m to NKr443m.
*****
Hafslund Nycomed, the Norwegian group best-known for its radiology products,
yesterday reported a 4 per cent rise in first-quarter pre-tax profit to
NKr381m.
The improvement, however, was restrained by lower sales in several European
markets and government price restrictions on pharmaceuticals.
The result was weaker than domestic analysts' forecasts of around NKr405m.
On the Oslo bourse yesterday, Hafslund's A shares closed NKr7 lower at
NKr143, as B shares plunged by NKr8 to NKr145 and free shares fell by NKr6
to NKr147.50. Group sales, including royalties, rose by NKr126m to
NKr1.541bn, as operating expenses increased by NKr175m to NKr873m.
Mr Eric Cameron, a Hafslund executive, said the increase in operating
expenses resulted from costs associated with the introduction of new
products into new markets and from increased purchases of electricity by the
energy division to meet higher demand. The capital outlay would be recovered
by subsequent electricity sales, he said.

FT  05 MAY 93 / International Company News: Cominco's woes test management
mettle - The Canadian metals group has failed to live up to expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE list of problems facing Cominco, the Canadian metals group, is long
enough to test the ability of the most hardened corporate trouble-shooter.
The price of zinc, Cominco's biggest revenue earner, has slumped by a
quarter in the past nine months, the company's flagship Red Dog mine in
Alaska is producing well below capacity, and a new lead smelter at Trail,
British Columbia, has been idle since it was commissioned more than three
years ago.
Burdened by hefty water taxes at Trail which keep rising even when profits
are falling, Cominco has lost CDollars 108m (USDollars 85.7m) since the
start of 1991. More than one-third of the loss occurred in the first three
months of this year. The share price is now only about half its 1989 peak of
CDollars 32.13.
As if that were not enough, Mr Robert Hallbauer, the forceful chief
executive who has spearheaded efforts to ease Cominco's financial and
production troubles, is undergoing treatment for leukaemia. He will be away
from the office for at least another two months.
Mr Norman Keevil, chairman, made no attempt to hide Cominco's woes at last
week's annual meeting in Vancouver. Announcing a suspension in the interim
dividend, he said: 'We cannot let (recent losses) continue for any length of
time'.
Cominco was expected to flourish after control shifted five years ago from
dowdy Canadian Pacific to an international base metals consortium comprising
Metallgesellschaft, the diversified German metals group, Australia's MIM
Holdings, and Teck Corporation of Vancouver. MIM and Teck own 45 per cent of
Cominco.
The new shareholders installed Mr Hallbauer, a Teck veteran, as chief
executive, and sent in a German marketing team.
But relations between the company and its new shareholders - and among the
shareholders themselves - have at times been strained.
Mr Keevil made an important break with the past at the annual meeting by
announcing that, after three years of indecision, Cominco was abandoning the
German-designed QSL technology used in the troubled lead smelter. It plans
to convert the facility to a smelting process known as Kivcet, developed in
Kazakhstan.
The saga of the smelter is by no means over, however. Cominco is claiming
compensation for an alleged breach of contract from Lurgi, the German
engineering group which designed the smelter. It may also claim for loss of
earnings during the three years it has had to rely on an old, inefficient
smelter which the QSL facility was meant to replace.
Chances are that Cominco's claim will go to arbitration. Mr Erik Menges,
head of Lurgi's commercial department, expresses 'surprise and
disappointment' at Cominco's decision.
He notes that QSL smelters are working successfully in Germany and Korea. Mr
Menges says Lurgi remains willing to adapt Trail to the high lead and zinc
residues contained in feedstock for the Canadian plant.
Cominco is confident Trail, one of the world's biggest metallurgical
complexes, can prosper. Despite the high-cost lead smelter, operating losses
there dropped to CDollars 10m last year from CDollars 53m in 1991.
Trail's big advantage is cheap power, due to two nearby hydro-electric
stations which Cominco owns. But as a big water consumer, Cominco is also
one of the few private companies in British Columbia subject to the
controversial water tax.
A provincial inquiry two years ago recommended a CDollars 14m cut in
property and water taxes as part of a package of measures needed to ensure
Trail's viability.
The social-democrat government has baulked, however, at reducing the water
levy, apparently for fear it will set a precedent for BC Hydro, the
provincial power utility.
Cominco is adamant the CDollars 100m conversion of the lead smelter to the
Kivcet process will not go ahead until the burden of the water levy is
lightened.
Talks between the two sides have quickened recently. The government is
understood to have offered other forms of relief, but Cominco is concerned
this would still expose it to hikes in the water levy.
Meanwhile, the company is examining ways of using its hydro-electric
resources to help finance conversion of the smelter. One possibility could
be to involve BC Hydro in expansion of the power plants.
Cominco believes the outlook for the Red Dog mine is brightening. The mine
produced only 70 per cent of its design output last year, as a result of
unexpectedly complex geology and high lead oxide impurities.
Mr Keevil told the annual meeting Red Dog should reach capacity before the
end of this year. That would lower unit costs by almost one-third, and make
the mine profitable even at the current zinc price of 46.5 US cents per
pound. Mr Rick Cohen, mining analyst at Goepel Shields in Toronto, thinks
the worst is over for Cominco.
Besides coming to grips with the problems at Trail and Red Dog, the company
has raised CDollars 158m by spinning off its fertiliser division into a new
public company.
The 60 per cent-owned Snip gold mine in northern BC has performed well above
expectations since it started production in early 1991. Another new
property, the Quebrada Blanca mine in Chile, in which Cominco has a 39 per
cent direct stake, is due to produce its first cathode copper early next
year - on schedule and on budget.
The best news would be a turnround in the zinc market. Cominco has cut 1993
metal output by 50,000 tonnes in an effort to help bring down swollen
worldwide inventories. But Mr Keevil has indicated further cutbacks are
unlikely unless other producers show a greater willingness to restrain their
output.

SHARES in Reader's Digest, the New York-based magazine publisher, fell by 13
per cent yesterday on disappointing revenues and flat operating profits.
On Wall Street, the shares closed down Dollars 6 at Dollars 40 1/2 , their
52-week low.
Operating profits were up only 2 per cent at Dollars 137.6m in the third
quarter to March 31, on revenues 3 per cent ahead at Dollars 737.6m. Net
income was 5 per cent higher at Dollars 95.5m.
The company said revenues would have risen 8 per cent without the impact of
foreign exchange rate movements. International revenues rose 10 per cent and
would have risen about 19 per cent without foreign currency movements.
Revenues from US operations fell 6 per cent to Dollars 307.6m due to lower
sales in the domestic Books and Home Entertainment Division.
Mr George Grune, chairman and chief executive officer, said: 'This quarter's
lower results stem from an increasing number of product offerings in a
relatively short time frame. Our testing indicates that these offerings
could have been better implemented.'
Mr Alan Gottesman, an analyst with PaineWebber, said the US Books and Home
Entertainment Division had been 'pushing too hard, with products competing
with each other'. But he added that the problem was now 'as bad as it is
going to get'.
Mr Grune said there were continued strong advertising sales for Reader's
Digest magazine and the company's special interest magazine group.
Magazine revenues rose 2 per cent to Dollars 173.5m for the quarter,
reflecting higher subscription prices and increased US advertising revenues.
The company also announced a programme to repurchase up to 3m class A
non-voting common shares after a similar programme in February 1992. It has
about 97m of the shares outstanding.

MR WALT Burdick, senior vice-president in charge of personnel at IBM, is to
retire at the end of May after 38 years with the company.
IBM did not name a successor to Mr Burdick. Industry analysts believe the
personnel director will be critical to a successful transformation of IBM
because the company must boost employee morale while cutting thousands of
jobs.
Dell Computer, the US PC maker, has promoted Mr Joel Kocher, US president of
operations, to oversee worldwide sales, marketing and service operations, in
a senior management shake-up.
The company also said Mr Andrew Harris, president of Dell International, had
resigned.

FT  05 MAY 93 / International Company News: Italian insurer hit by
investment write-down
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RIUNIONE Adriatica di Sicurta, the stock market listed Italian insurance
company controlled by Allianz of Germany, reported a steep drop in net
profits to L95bn (Dollars 63m) last year from L201bn in 1991.
The reduction came in spite of a 13.9 per cent rise in group premiums to
L7,337bn and a 14.5 per cent increase to L3,720bn for parent company
premiums.
Mr Umberto Zanni, chairman, explained the earnings slide stemmed from a
L214bn write-down on the group's investment portfolio. Like other financial
institutions, RAS has had to write down heavily the value of its government
bond holdings due to last year's severe price volatility.
However, Mr Zanni stressed the recovery in government securities in the past
four months implied RAS would show sharp extraordinary earnings this year.
Mr Zanni also pointed to a marked upturn in the group's underwriting
position. Losses on the non-life side fell by L30bn to L147bn. 'But for
third party motor insurance, we would have shown a underwriting profit in
1992,' he said.
The group is looking forward to the planned liberalisation of the motor
insurance market in July 1994, which will allow tariff increases and the
introduction of more personalised policies geared to clients' claims
records.
In the meantime, RAS hopes the government will approve a reasonable increase
in tariffs for this year.
The underwriting improvement was reflected in a 22 per cent rise in
operating profits to L240bn in 1992.
Combined with the upturn in bond prices, RAS has decided to pay an unchanged
dividend of L300 a share for ordinary shares and L360 a share for savings
stock.
The payout, which leaves only L7.9bn of net earn-ings attributable to
extraordinary reserves, is 24 per cent higher than that in 1991 due to last
November's rights issue.

DECLINING telecommunications profits, a lower contribution from Northern
Telecom and special charges depressed BCE's results in the first quarter.
BCE, Canada's biggest telecommunications group and the holding company
controlling Bell Canada, Northern Telecom and many other communications
interests, reported net profit of CDollars 221m (USDollars 175.3m), or 65
cents per share, down one-third from CDollars 298m, or 88 cents, a year
earlier.
Total revenues were CDollars 5bn, up 3 per cent from CDollars 4.86bn,
including CDollars 4.7bn from telecommunications, against CDollars 4.5bn.
Mr Lynton Wilson, chairman, told the annual meeting BCE's performance
reflected relatively flat revenues from 100 per cent-owned Bell Canada and
CDollars 86m of Bell special restructuring expense.
'Bell Canada's results for the rest of 1993 should improve, although they
will be affected by a telephone rate application,' he said. Most of Bell
Canada's activities are regulated by the federal government.
Bell Canada's contribution equalled 48 cents per BCE share, against 71 cents
a year earlier. The utility's local business gained slightly with an
improving economy, but rising competition from Unitel and resellers reduced
long-distance volume.
Bell Canada is countering with new services and options that generate higher
revenues.
International telecom business was up, reflecting higher volume and last
year's acquisition of 20 per cent of Mercury Communications.
Northern Telecom's results in the first quarter were hit by slower margins
and higher research and market development costs.
It contributed 15 cents per BCE share, against 20 cents. Corporate
activities showed a CDollars 2m loss, against a CDollars 7m deficit a year
earlier. This included the financial services unit.
The first quarter also included a special gain of 10 cents a BCE share from
the sale of TransCanada Pipelines stock.
Mr Wilson said BCE's telecommunications business cannot compete effectively
if federal regulation continued to be stifling and unpredictable. 'Market
forces must play a larger role in setting prices or Bell Canada will have to
be reorganised to improve financial returns,' he said.
Mercury would benefit from BCE's research, equipment manufacturing and
network development and the link with Cable &amp; Wireless will give BCE greater
international reach.
BCE planned other alliances and investments and would spend CDollars 2bn on
international expansion, he said, while Northern Telecom would focus its
expansion on Asia, eastern Europe and Latin America.

   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BASS, the British brewer, is negotiating to buy a large stake in Prazske
Pivovary (Prague Breweries), the Czech Republic's second-largest brewer
which was privatised last year.
The companies would not comment on the negotiations, but western investment
consultants in Prague said talks between Bass and a consortium of investment
funds have continued for some months.
At the beginning of negotiations, Bass is said to have been seeking a
minority position in the Czech company, with the aim of gradually raising
its stake through capital injections.
The consortium includes some of the largest Czech investment funds which
gained control of most of the 72 per cent of the company's shares sold in
last year's voucher privatisation. The funds have yet to receive the shares
from the government, but they are acting as de-facto owners.
The share transfer, due last month, was postponed because of a dispute
between Prague and Bratislava.
Other shareholders include the National Property Fund, which oversees
privatisation, with 10 per cent; employees (10 per cent); Pragopivot (5 per
cent), and the Restitution Fund (3 per cent). Total common equity is
Kcs880.5m (Dollars 31m).
The Czech company was established in 1948 and has three large breweries. In
1991, it reported a pre-tax profit of Kcs217.7m on sales of Kcs1.03bn.

FT  05 MAY 93 / International Company News: Japanese banks step up action to
rescue Kumagai
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan will send the head of its London branch
back to Tokyo to oversee the restructuring of international operations at
Kumagai Gumi, the Japanese contractor and property developer, burdened by
about Y700bn (Dollars 6.3bn) in debt.
LTCB's move follows the transfer of an executive at Sumitomo Bank to assist
in the restructuring of Kumagai's domestic operations, hurt by the collapse
of Japanese property prices and by its own financial exposure to
unsuccessful resort developments.
The joint effort by the two leading Japanese banks highlights the
seriousness of the situation at Kumagai, which has struggled in domestic and
international markets to meet a goal, set last year, of selling Y300bn in
properties over five years to reduce its debt.
Mr Yasunori Fujii, general manager of LTCB's London branch, is expected to
return to Japan at the end of this week and be formally appointed senior
managing director of Kumagai, responsible for international business, at a
board meeting next month.
LTCB officials said the bank became involved because it backed some of
Kumagai's ventures and has a small stake in the company, which had an envied
reputation in Japan in the 1980s as a successful international contractor.
But the company has begun to retreat from the international market, and over
the past three years overseas receipts have fallen from 25 per cent to 8 per
cent of sales.
Kumagai has already been forced to sell cherished assets, including a
self-developed office complex in Reading, Berkshire, sold in late March for
a reported Y7.7bn.
It has also raised funds by reducing a stake in the increasingly independent
Kumagai Gumi (Hong Kong), which is particularly successful in the Chinese
market. Three years ago, Kumagai held 35 per cent of the Hong Kong company,
but that will be to just over 6 per cent under a deal announced last month.

FT  05 MAY 93 / International Company News: Botin family fuels Spanish
lending war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE POWERFUL Botin family delivered its second assault on Spain's domestic
financial sector within a week with the announcement yesterday that
Bankinter, its smaller retail banking unit, was offering interest of 16 per
cent on one-month deposits of Pta1m (Dollars 8,695).
The development followed a rapid counter-attack by most of Spain's leading
banks which sought to neutralise a bold initiative by Banco Santander, the
Botin family's major bank, to capture the domestic mortgage market by
offering sharp rate cuts to homebuyers.
Santander launched a 'lending war' on Friday by cutting its variable
mortgage rate by 0.75 per cent to 11.50 per cent and by offering, as a new
product, 12-year mortgages at a fixed 11.50 per cent. With the notable
exception of Banesto, all Santander's rival banks had by yesterday announced
similar rate cuts.
Although Bankinter and Santander are formally separate institutions Mr
Emilio Botin, chairman of Santander, is deputy chairman of Bankinter and his
brother Mr Jaime Botin, chairman of Bankinter, is deputy chairman of
Santander. The Botin family owns nearly 6 per cent of Santander and, both
directly and indirectly, close to 50 per cent of Bankinter.
The interest rate now being offered by Bankinter is well above anything that
is being offered by the domestic high street banks. At best, depositors
could obtain around 13 per cent for one-year deposits in excess of Pta20m.
Bankinter, which is very tightly managed bank, is able to offer 16 per cent
because it is a net lender on the interbank market where current rates are
between 15.75 and 17 per cent.
Overheads at Bankinter are minimal - a key element in the 16 per cent
interest on offer is that clients may arrange their high interest deposits
on the phone - and the bank is clearly willing to accept a very small margin
in order to widen its deposit base.
Santander, which has an extremely large deposit base largely as a result of
a pioneering venture into high interest accounts four years ago, is now
pursuing the strategy of breaking forcefully into the mortgage market.
Mortgages have up to now been dominated by the savings banks and by the
state-controlled institutions of the Argentaria banking group.

FT  05 MAY 93 / International Company News: Record capital increase at
Banesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANESTO, the large Spanish commercial bank, is to make a capital increase
worth some Pta130bn (Dollars 1.12bn), the largest in Spanish history, in a
three-stage plan co-ordinated with J. P. Morgan.
The plan, early details of which were made public in February, would be used
to strengthen the bank's capital base. Its BIS ratio would rise from 9.3 per
cent to 12 per cent. A weak capital base has long been a drag on Banesto's
profitability, analysts say.
Banesto said the three phases of the plan, which had also attracted a
promised investment from GE Capital, would involve:
A three-for-one rights issue, announced in February, designed to raise
Pta52.66bn in new capital. New shares would be priced at Pta1,500. J. P.
Morgan's Dollars 1bn Corsair bank fund will invest Dollars 200m in this
issue, offering an extra Pta400 per share for subscription rights. This
could give the fund a stake of close to 10 per cent in Banesto. Mr Mario
Conde, Banesto president, will also subscribe to the issue to raise his
personal holding of 2 per cent. If the Corsair fund is unable to spend all
Dollars 200m on the rights issue it would commit the remainder to the second
phase;
A placement, with investors, of 22.2m shares worth Pta42.25bn. Some Dollars
20m of this will be shares distributed by the bank to employees priced at
Pta1,900. Banesto said this was 27 per cent more than current shareholders
had paid but the bank's stock closed in Madrid yesterday at Pta2,350.
Banesto also said GE Capital and Northwestern Mutual would invest Dollars
25m each while an investor group led by Mr Jose Roquette, president of Banco
Totta &amp; Acores, the Portuguese bank bought by Banesto two years ago, would
spend Dollars 50m. A Dollars 400m convertible bond issue abroad. Banesto
said the five-year bonds would carry a coupon of between 6 and 7 per cent
and would help increase its second-tier capital.
Although some analysts in Madrid questioned how easily the bank would meet
its dividend obligations next year to a much wider group of shareholders,
the plans have been greeted positively. The presence of J. P. Morgan as
leader of the Corsair group has lent credibility to the operation.
Banesto's successful sale earlier this year of its Banco de Madrid affiliate
to the Deutsche Bank for Pta42bn has also greatly strengthened market
confidence in the bank.
It was, nevertheless, being vague last night about what it intended to do
with the money it was raising, saying, among other things, that it wanted to
attract first rate shareholders, to strengthen collaboration with Banco
Totta and to unite the interests of the board and the bank's workforce.

<TEXT>
BHF-BANK, the Frankfurt-based merchant bank, is set to forge a co-operation
agreement with the Dusseldorf-based IKB Deutsche Industriekreditbank, an
institution which specialises in providing long-term finance to small and
medium-sized businesses.
The agreement, announced after the stock market closed yesterday, is to
coincide with a share swap agreement under which BHF has taken a 10 per cent
stake in IKB whilst the Dusseldorf institution will acquire 3.5 per cent of
BHF's share.
No price was given for BHF's share purchase, but it is likely that it paid
about DM190m (Dollars 118m) for the IKB holding.
The move is the bank's second large expansion move within months, following
its Pounds 235m (Dollars 361.9m) agreement to buy jointly a 90 per cent
stake in Charterhouse, the UK merchant bank with Credit Commercial de
France.
The German banks said that the agreement is to focus on a number of business
areas including the provision of credit for companies, export and credit
financing, as well as mergers and acquisitions and other types of corporate
finance advisory work.
BHF increased group operating profits by 6.9 per cent last year to DM366m.
Group business volume is DM54bn compared with DM37bn at IKB. The two banks
have for the past 10 years worked together via a jointly-owned property
leasing company.
At the same time, the two banks said IKB and Credit National, its French
co-operation partner, would be taking a 5 per cent cross-holding in each
other with the aim of intensifying financing business for Franco-German
investment.

operational shake-up

ITALY'S banking sector could be set for further rationalisation with signs
that Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, the country's biggest bank in
terms of assets, may merge operations of its two big regional banking
subsidiaries into the parent.
The news comes with an admission by the bank, which floated 20 per cent of
its shares last year, that it is also considering changing its articles of
association to allow a majority of its equity to be listed.
San Paolo is one of six big Italian banks, formally owned by charitable
institutions, which are closely associated with the public sector. So far,
only two have listed their shares, and none has gone beyond floating a
minority of its equity capital.
The bank's board last week took the first step to incorporating its big
Banco Lariano and Banca Provinciale Lombarda subsidiaries by commissioning a
study to consider the effects of their merger with the parent company. The
move has been mooted before, but it is the first time the bank has taken
firm action to pursue it further.
Banco Lariano, based in Como and 85 per cent owned by San Paolo, has assets
of L18,805bn (Dollars 12.6bn). Assets of Bergamo-based Banca Provinciale
Lombarda, which is 70 per cent owned, totalled L17,397bn at end-1992. San
Paolo itself has total assets of L150,613bn.
Incorporation of the subsidiaries could provide considerable tax and cost
savings. However, the move has always been rejected on the grounds that it
would risk alienating clients.

FT  05 MAY 93 / International Company News: Bass negotiates for large
holding in Prague brewer
</HEADLINE>

   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BASS, the British brewer, is negotiating to buy a large stake in Prazske
Pivovary (Prague Breweries), the Czech Republic's second-largest brewer
which was privatised last year.
The companies would not comment on the negotiations, but western investment
consultants in Prague said talks between Bass and a consortium of investment
funds have continued for some months.
At the beginning of negotiations, Bass is said to have been seeking a
minority position in the Czech company, with the aim of gradually raising
its stake through capital injections. An analyst said yesterday: 'They
wanted something in the 35 to 40 per cent range, which was roughly the
amount of shares available through the large (investment) funds. I don't
think that's changed.'
The consortium includes some of the largest Czech investment funds which
gained control of most of the 72 per cent of the company's shares sold in
last year's voucher privatisation. The funds have yet to receive the shares
from the government, but they are acting as de-facto owners. 'They got
together and agreed on a strategy for selling the brewery,' the analyst
said.
The share transfer, due last month, was postponed because of a dispute
between Prague and Bratislava.
Other shareholders include the National Property Fund, which oversees
privatisation, with 10 per cent; employees (10 per cent); Pragopivot (5 per
cent), and the Restitution Fund (3 per cent). Total common equity is
Kcs880.5m (Dollars 31m).
The Czech company was established in 1948 and has three large breweries. In
1991, it reported a pre-tax profit of Kcs217.7m on sales of Kcs1.03bn.

FT  05 MAY 93 / International Company News: SE Banken firm in heavy trade

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Scandinaviska Enskilda Banken yesterday stood at more than twice
their value of a week ago as market sentiment that the worst of Sweden's
banking crisis may be over fuelled more heavy trading in the stock of the
country's biggest, but loss-burdened, bank.
SE Banken's most-traded A shares closed last night at SKr16.50, down
slightly from Monday's close of SKr17 on profit-taking, but still far ahead
of their level last Tuesday of SKr7.60.
Although the surge in price of the past two trading days was checked, the
number of shares traded - 10.4m - was 24 per cent ahead of Monday's volume.
The dramatic rally was touched off when Mr Bjorn Svedberg, the chief
executive, told the bank's annual meeting on April 27 that first-quarter
operating results before loan losses would show an improvement.
This hint of recovery after last year's full-year operating loss of
SKr5.37bn (Dollars 705m) was followed by an announcement from Svenska
Handelsbanken that it would show a first-quarter profit, with
lower-than-expected loan losses, and a fall in first-quarter losses at Gota
Bank.
Analysts said the combination of a brighter outlook for the banks and the
low price of SE Banken shares set off the rally. But they warned there were
still high risks attached to the banking sector, which would continue to
carry high loan losses this year and next.
SE Banken, apparently itself concerned that the market turnround may be
premature, repeated advice to investors that it considered the outlook for
its shares to be 'uncertain'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Somerset Trust, formerly known as the Children's Medical Charity
Investment Trust, were suspended yesterday morning at 178p at the request of
the company, which later announced that it was in talks which might lead to
a substantial acquisition.
The potential acquisition is a manufacturing company with turnover of about
Pounds 20m. If the acquisition proceeds it will constitute a reverse
takeover of Somerset.
The consideration of some Pounds 19m will be funded by a placing and rights
issue. The company expects to make a further announcement in the next three
to four weeks.
The trust currently holds the bulk of its funds in short-dated gilts. Last
September, it reported a rise in net asset value to 86.2p per share as at
June 30, against 82.6p six months earlier.

FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Both knights fall during the extended
battle for Trafalgar - Roland Rudd details the boardroom manoeuvrings with a
Far Eastern twist which culminated in yesterday's changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PURGE of the board of Trafalgar House was completed yesterday, at the
behest of Mr Simon Keswick, chairman of Hongkong Land. But the decision to
clear out the top posts was taken well before Hongkong Land emerged with a
25 per cent stake in the construction, engineering and property group.
In the spring of last year Sir Nigel Broackes, the former chairman and
founder, set in motion a chain of events that culminated in the
blood-letting.
At a meeting of his non-executives Sir Nigel presented a plan in favour of
what he called an orderly succession. Both he and Sir Eric Parker, chief
executive since 1983, would step down on their 60th birthdays. Sir Nigel,
however, would remain with the group in a consultancy basis as honorary
president.
Since Sir Eric was a year older than Sir Nigel and had in effect run the
group for four years, the non-executives saw the plan as an attempt by Sir
Nigel to remove Sir Eric early when he reached his 60th birthday in June
1993, one of the directors said.
Sir Nigel complained that Sir Eric was dragging his feet over implementing
the change in group strategy agreed in January 1991. There was unanimity
among the directors then that with the fall in property prices Trafalgar
should be repositioned as a construction and engineering group. It no longer
wanted the conglomerate tag.
Yet the only significant sale, of its Ellerman container shipping interests
to the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company for Pounds 42.5m,
was dwarfed by the acquisition of the ill-fated Davy Corporation, hit by a
Pounds 114m loss on an oil rig conversion.
After listening to Sir Nigel the non-executives agreed to review possible
management changes later last year.
But the three non-executives, Mr Alan Clements, former finance director of
Imperial Chemical Industries, Mr Tony Ryan, chairman and founder of GPA, the
aircraft leasing company and Mr David Howell, the Conservative MP, refused
to back Sir Nigel's call for Sir Eric's departure.
They decided Sir Eric should remain until he was 62, when they thought he
would want to retire at his own volition.
There then followed a series of leaked reports that Trafalgar had decided to
sell its hotels, including the Ritz, and the Cunard Shipping Line.
Sir Eric denied the reports when the group reported its half year results in
May, infuriating Sir Nigel. The following week Sir Eric organised a seminar
in the City aimed at convincing the market that Trafalgar was no longer a
conglomerate, but a world class construction and engineering group.
Investors and analysts were sceptical, though, about the group's
presentation.
With shareholder discontent mounting Sir Nigel went back to the
non-executives in September to force Sir Eric's departure. The chief
executive's position was further undermined when the Financial Reporting
Review Panel told Trafalgar that the property write-downs at the end of 1991
should have been taken through the profit and loss account and not through
reserves.
Although in September the board had not yet agreed to accept the panel's
finding, the questioning of its accounting methods proved too much for the
three non-executives who reversed their earlier decision.
They agreed Sir Eric would have to go early to be replaced by Mr Allan
Gormly, the current chief executive, who was then head of the successful
engineering division.
However, Sir Eric, who had a good relationship with many of his executive
directors, made it clear to some of his colleagues that he was only prepared
to go early if Sir Nigel went with him.
He received an unexpected boost when a report in The Observer on September
20 said he was being forced to depart after losing the confidence of his
board. A number of directors, believing Sir Nigel leaked the information,
rallied round Sir Eric.
Although Sir Nigel told colleagues he had nothing to do with article, it
galvanised the executive directors into taking action.
At board meeting later in September they took the lead from the
non-executives in pressing for management changes. Sir Eric and Sir Nigel
were asked to leave the meeting. The rest of the directors decided that both
the chief executive and chairman would retire in 1993.
Less than a week later, on October 1, Hongkong Land took a 14.99 per cent
stake and demanded boardroom representation. Trafalgar reacted by bringing
forward its management changes. Mr Alan Clements became non-executive
chairman as a temporary measure.
Meanwhile, Hongkong Land, which tightened its grip by gradually taking its
stake up to 25 per cent, had two of its directors, Mr Rodney Leach and Sir
Charles Powell, appointed as non-executives.
Hongkong Land considered having Sir Charles take over as chairman but
decided instead on Mr Keswick, who with his brother Henry in effect runs the
Jardine Matheson empire.
A question mark remained over Mr John Ansdell, the finance director. As one
executive put it: 'His crime was not standing up to Parker over the
accounting fiasco.' However one of the group's advisers said Mr Ansdell just
happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
If the row over the accounts was a good enough reason for the non-executives
to seek an early replacement for Sir Eric, then, according to a financier
close to Hongkong Land, it was good enough for the Keswicks to seek a new
finance director.

FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Mosaic shares poised to return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING IN the shares of Mosaic Investments, the Birmingham-based
mini-conglomerate which has been reorganising its business and finance for
the last nine months, is expected to resume on May 28.
The relisting, however, is dependent on shareholders' agreement at meetings
the day before to approve an elaborate finance package.
The shares were suspended on September 29 last year at 60p, valuing the
group at Pounds 10m.
Mosaic had failed to raise finance for the redemption of preference shares
and had to pass a dividend it had already announced.
The new-look group will have, if shareholders agree, a new equity structure,
new bank facilities and a changed board.
The package embracing these elements includes:
Revised arrangements to redeem 2.99m preference shares held by Mr Rodney
Day; he will be paid Pounds 1 a share for 515,625 shares now, the same
amount for 1.5m shares in tranches spread over 10 years and will convert the
balance of his holding into ordinary shares.
Arrangements to issue new ordinary shares at 20p apiece to the owners of
companies bought between 1988 and 1990, in order to settle the initial
purchase terms which involved not only immediate cash payments but deferred
payment in shares.
The effect of these arrangements is to lift the number of issued shares from
17.08m to 34.38m.
Mr Day will end up with 14.5 per cent of the equity, while the previous
owners of companies bought by Mosaic - T Turner, Stainless Steel Services
and IBH Advertising and Design - will respectively hold 17.2 per cent, 18.3
per cent and 5.5 per cent.
Meanwhile, Mosaic has enlisted the support of Lloyds as its new banker.
Lloyds, if the new shareholding arrangements are approved and the shares are
relisted, will provide Mosaic with an overdraft of Pounds 3m and a 5-year
loan of Pounds 1.75m.
Although the core businesses have been trading profitably, Mr Hugh Sykes,
chairman, said yesterday that 'the re-organisation we've done produces
enormous extraordinary and exceptional charges and when you deduct them you
get a hefty loss.'

FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Thomas Cook bolsters its Canadian operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOMAS COOK, the travel agency chain which is controlled by Westdeutsche
Landesbank, has acquired Marlin Travel, Canada's largest travel chain, for
CDollars 22m (Pounds 11.3m).
Thomas Cook said the deal made it the biggest retailer in the Canadian
business and leisure travel market with an 11 per cent share and 350
outlets. It is to pay an additional CDollars 3m deferred consideration,
subject to Marlin's performance over the next two years.
Marlin, which is privately-owned, has 840 employees and 251 outlets in
Canadian shopping malls. Mr Rod Marlin and Mr Gary Elliott, its two
founders, own 52 per cent of its equity.
Thomas Cook said the North American Free Trade Agreement and the integration
of the North American travel business had made the strengthening of its
Canadian operation a priority.
The company has been prevented from operating directly in the US because
federal regulations prevent banks from owning travel companies. Until last
year, Thomas Cook was owned by Midland Bank. It operates in the US through
Thomas Cook Travel US, a franchised organisation.

FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Observer board backs sale to Guardian
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of The Observer, which includes independent directors, yesterday
gave its unanimous backing to a sale of the Sunday title to The Guardian and
Manchester Evening News.
A statement issued last night said: 'The Observer board agreed unanimously
that negotiations should proceed towards early finalisation of a contractual
agreement with The Guardian.'
Neither Observer directors nor Guardian management would comment further.
The deal agreed in principle, however, is believed to value The Observer at
about Pounds 27m - a sum that would be paid to Lonrho, owner of The
Observer, over two years.
Any transfer of ownership to GMEN would require the permission of Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, under the provisions of the Fair
Trading Act relating to newspaper mergers.
A reference to the Mergers and Monopolies Commission is automatic unless Mr
Heseltine is satisfied the paper was not economic as a going concern and
that the case is urgent.
The Observer is a loss-making paper but Mr Heseltine has made it clear to
parliament that he could not reach a view until he can study the terms of
any application.

MR DENIS MULHALL is leaving Tomkins, the conglomerate which among other
things makes Smith and Wesson guns and gardening machinery, to join
Berisford International, the property and agriculture group, as finance
director. He is expected to take up the appointment in the summer.
Mr Mulhall's most recent job within Tomkins was at Ranks Hovis McDougall,
the milling, baking and grocery products company which Tomkins acquired at
the end of last year.
At Tomkins Mr Mulhall was one of the team which integrated the group's
acquisitions. Berisford is currently bidding Pounds 184m for C&amp;J Clark, the
private shoe company.
Berisford's proposals will be put to Clark's shareholders at a special
meeting on Friday, May 7. Berisford is expected today to make a final appeal
to Clark's shareholders to vote in favour of the deal.
Mr Mulhall said the move to buy Clark was very exciting.

FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Ingham makes recovery to Pounds 452,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INGHAM, the worsted spinner and retailer of new parts for British classic
sports cars, returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 452,000 for the 12 months to
end-December.
The year-end has been changed to March 31 and the outcome compared with
losses of Pounds 152,000 for the corresponding 12 months.
Last month, when Ingham gave details of the proposed acquisition of Moss
Europe and an accompanying rights issue, shareholders were told that the
figures in the second interim statement would be meaningless for purposes of
comparison.
They included the results of Transtar for three months only; the period
coincided with Transtar's traditionally quietist trading period.
Ingham's earnings emerged at 6.1p (losses 4.7p). Payment of a 1.25p final
dividend has been brought forward for a total of 7.25p (3p for the 12 months
to December 31 1991).

FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: 89% take up RTZ scrip dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ENHANCED scrip dividend offered to investors by RTZ Corporation, the
mining group, has been taken up by holders of 89 per cent, or 895m, of the
group's shares. The level of take-up was higher than many expected.
The success of the offer means that RTZ will retain about Pounds 156m of
cash that would have been paid out in dividend and advance corporation tax
due on the dividend.
Under the offer, shareholders could take a dividend in shares of 20.25p, 50
per cent more than the final cash dividend of 13.5p. Shareholders had to
register for the scrip dividend by last Friday.
The dividend has to be approved at today's annual meeting, but the vote is
expected to be overwhelmingly in favour.
Shareholders could also sell their scrip shares through BZW, the
stockbroker, at 19.25p, a 5 per cent discount to the scrip value. BZW said
it had requests for the cash offer from holders of 168m shares, or 19 per
cent of those taking the enhanced scrip.
The number of shares to be issued to satisfy the scrip dividend will be
calculated next week. BZW will have to place Pounds 32m worth of shares. At
yesterday's closing price of 645p, down 4p, that would represent about 5m
shares, or about three times the volume of RTZ shares traded yesterday.
RTZ was the second of the group of companies which introduced enhanced scrip
dividends, following BAT Industries, the tobacco and insurance group.

SIR HARRY Solomon, who last week stepped down as chairman of Hillsdown
Holdings, has sold 1m shares in the food group, cutting his stake to 4.38m
shares. He sold at 161p a share,cum-dividend.
Sir Harry, who remains a non-executive director, is understood to have
wanted to raise cash to invest in new activities and for charitable reasons.
He also has options to buy 658,000 Hillsdown shares.
Meanwhile, Mr Ray Mackie, who became finance director of the group last
week, has bought 25,000 shares at 155p ex-dividend each. Hillsdown shares
rose 7p to 164p.
Hillsdown also said yesterday that it had sold its Harvest Poultry
operations, based in Norfolk and Suffolk, to its management for Pounds 6m.
The MBO, led by Mr David Thacker, was backed by 3i, the investment capital
group.
Since Hillsdown bought the JP Wood poultry operations from Unigate last
spring it has been reorganising capacity.

FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Calculators come out after Man United
League win
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE FANS of Manchester United Football Club reached for their
handkerchiefs to wipe away tears of joy at winning the Premier League
championship, City commentators were reaching for their calculators.
The title secures a place in the European Champions Cup and that means extra
profits for Manchester United plc in 1993-94. Yesterday the shares closed at
a new high of 463p, about 180p up on the start of the football season last
August.
Not that it is easy to settle on a new profits forecast. The tournament
could add anything between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 5m or more, depending
on the team's progress and TV income. Mr David Murray, chairman of Glasgow
Rangers, says his club earned Pounds 4m net of costs from playing in the
European Cup this season.
Volatility of cup income joins the other great variable, spending on
players, in making forecasting particularly difficult. This year analysts
have pencilled in Pounds 5.3m pre-tax for United, assuming Pounds 2m net
spending on players.
Ironically, the Premier League win will slightly reduce expected 1992-93
profits. Although it brings Pounds 858,000 in prize money as part of the
League's broadcasting deal with BSkyB, players' bonuses will take a chunk of
that.
The benefits of playing in the Champions Cup flow through in the next
financial year. According to Mr Robin Launders, United's finance director,
the potential profit score sheet totals about Pounds 4.3m and reads like
this:
Each of the first and second rounds could earn Pounds 500,000 profit.
The mini-league stage guarantees six games and could bring in Pounds 900,000
profit on home gates (regarded as a conservative estimate) and an average of
Pounds 1.3m from UEFA, the sport's governing body. If United wins through to
a semi-final, he estimates that another Pounds 420,000 would come via the
points system, plus about Pounds 700,000 from gate and television fees.
The final - at a neutral venue - would add little extra because of large
bills in terms of team bonuses and travel expenses.
Apart from the large gap between top and bottom profit estimates, there is
one other caveat. United's need to buy players may be increased by UEFA's
restrictions on fielding 'foreign' players. Eight of United's regular
first-team players are Welsh, Scottish, Irish, Danish, French or Russian.

FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Auditors qualify annual report of ECH
subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENTERPRISE Computer Holdings' principal subsidiary, Enterprise Computer
Services, has had its annual report qualified on a going concern basis by
KPMG Peat Marwick, its auditors.
The accounts cover the 15 months to March 31 1992 when the group posted
pre-tax losses of Pounds 8.33m on turnover of Pounds 157.9m.
However, the supplier of second user IBM computers said the boards of both
the parent company and the subsidiary were satisfied that the group's bank
facilities would continue to be available for a period 'which will allow the
auditors to report on the accounts to March 31 1993 without a going concern
qualification.'
In a statement yesterday the group said its confidence stemmed from the
improved trading performance during the last quarter, and the pending merger
of Teltronics and SRH, a company in which Enterprise has a 25 per cent
equity stake, which is expected to be completed before June 30.
The merger is expected to result in the group receiving Pounds 5.3m in cash,
property and securities over the next 12 months.
Since June last year Enterprise has undergone a substantial reorganisation
and restructuring under a new management team led by Mr Shaun Dowling,
non-executive chairman.

FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Unilever expansion in China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products company, plans to expand its
presence in China by building a fabric detergents plant and an ice cream
factory with local partners.
The total initial cost is Dollars 60m (Pounds 40m), which is likely to
double in the near future.
The detergents plant is being built by Unilever Shanghai, in which Unilever
has 70 per cent and Shanghai Daily Chemical and Shanghai Detergents each
hold 15 per cent. Unilever began selling imported Omo concentrated detergent
in Shanghai in February and said the potential market for washing powder was
huge.
The ice cream factory will be built in Beijing by Wall's Beijing, 85 per
cent owned by Unilever the state-owned Sumstar holding the balance. The
factory will make products under the Wall's name.
Unilever already has three joint ventures in the Shanghai region making soap
and shampoo, bakery fats and skin care products.
Mr Michael Perry, Unilever chairman, told the annual meeting yesterday that
failure to settle the Uruguay Round of trade talks would damage recovery
prospects in the industrialised world and retard progress in developing
countries.
He also said that if the European Community did not ratify the Maastricht
Treaty, it would be a big setback for business. After ratification, however,
a 'more realistic' timetable should be drawn up for economic and monetary
integration.

Net has 18 duty-free shops in 10 locations including Turkey's main tourist
airports. Allders International is the second largest duty-free retailer in

FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Storehouse and LET unwind property deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOREHOUSE, the high street retail store group, and London and Edinburgh
Trust, the property company, are unwinding the joint venture they set up in
March 1989.
Storehouse also said yesterday that the search for a new chief executive
continued but was unlikely to be completed soon. Mr David Dworkin left in
February to join Carter Hawley Hale Stores in the US.
The disentanglement of the venture, called Oppidan Estates, will involve
Storehouse paying a net Pounds 37.5m to buy back 28 properties, mainly BhS
stores. LET will buy Storehouse's half share and other retail assets
including three Owen Owen department stores and some prime shop properties.
Both sides said the deal made sense in 1989 but it was now better to untie
the partnership. Storehouse said the effect would be neutral to current year
earnings but should be positive in future years.
Storehouse originally received Pounds 86m when the venture was set up near
the peak of the retail property market. But it said changes in the portfolio
since meant that the Pounds 37.5m cost of buying back the properties was not
comparable.
Storehouse has bought back the 28 shops for Pounds 67.7m and LET is paying
Pounds 26.5m for Storehouse's half share in Oppidan plus Pounds 2.1m for
three other properties. The net figure of Pounds 37.5m, is after tax. LET is
keeping 15 properties with a value of Pounds 65.7m.
A number of the BhS shops in the Oppidan portfolio were due to come up for
rent reviews, so Storehouse is avoiding that future liability. It reckons it
will save Pounds 6.5m a year in rental costs, but lose its share of Oppidan
profits which were Pounds 2.7m in 1991-92.
In 1989 Storehouse's profits were falling and its balance sheet was
stretched. It was also being stalked by Mr Asher Edelman who had built up a
7.1 per cent stake in the group. The then chief executive Mr Michael Julien,
who had joined in 1988, was looking for ways to cut debt and the Oppidan
venture allowed Storehouse to move some properties off balance sheet.

FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Nicholas Ward quits managing director role
at Brent Walker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NICHOLAS Ward has resigned as group managing director of Brent Walker,
the pubs and betting shops group which last year completed a Pounds 1.65bn
refinancing.
Mr Ward's departure follows that of Mr Ken Scobie, chief executive, who left
in January amid suggestions that the group's banks, headed by Standard
Chartered, had pushed him out. Mr Ward is expected to receive compensation,
although no amount was announced.
Brent Walker has yet to produce accounts for 1992.
Mr Ward's resignation leaves only one of the four-man executive team which
was put into Brent Walker in the early months of the 18 month-long
refinancing, when Mr George Walker, who had been chairman and chief
executive, was ousted. Mr John Leach remains as finance director.
At the time of Mr Scobie's resignation Brent Walker announced the
appointment of Sir Keith Bright as chairman, following a long search after
Lord Kindersley left after last year's annual meeting.
Brent Walker published a brief statement yesterday saying that Mr Ward had
'played a significant part in negotiating the restructuring of the company's
financial affairs and in organising its programme of disposals'. It thanked
him for his 'considerable contribution'.
However, few disposals have taken place and the banks, which are also
majority shareholders, are thought to be concerned that more have not been
completed.
Brent Walker's statement yesterday echoed that made in January when Mr
Scobie left, and like that was published after the stock market closed.
Brent Walker's shares were up  1/2 p at 10 1/4 p.

FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Goodhead warns of setback
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GOODHEAD Group, the printer and publisher, yesterday warned of a further
profit fall for the current year to end-May 1993.
The shares closed 1p lower at 25p.
In January the company reported a 58 per cent drop in first - half pre - tax
profits to Pounds 181,000, after exceptional charges of Pounds 133,000.
For the whole of 1991 - 92 the profit was Pounds 721,000, compared with
Pounds 4.02m in the previous 12 months.
In a trading statement issued yesterday the directors said that trading
conditions deteriorated in the third seasonally difficult quarter in both
the design and print divisions, due principally to uncertainty in the
economy, and high interest rates which led to cancellation of orders.
The company said that as such the group was likely to report a reduction on
the profit achieved for the first half of the current year.
However, profitability has been restored to all areas of its activities,
directors said.

FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Silentnight's Pounds 12m pleases City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUING pressure on margins because of recession reduced profits at
Silentnight Holdings, Europe's biggest manufacturer of beds, by 3 per cent
to Pounds 12m pre-tax for the year to end-January.
Sales increased 12 per cent to Pounds 153.9m (Pounds 137.6m). The
Lancashire-based group said, however, that margins had improved in the
second half and that it had increased market share in the UK.
Mr Bill Davies, executive chairman, said: 'I believe the coming year will
continue to be difficult as margins in the UK, our main market, remain under
pressure. However, there are encouraging signs within the UK and the US of
an upturn which is long overdue.'
The UK beds businesses increased sales 5 per cent to Pounds 99m, but found
margins extremely difficult to maintain. Mr Davies said: 'Bed volumes have
been less affected by the recession than many other consumer products.
However, the pressure on disposable income has meant that price is an
increasingly important factor in the achievement of sales.
'Nonetheless we believe our bed companies increased their market share, and
have been successful in improving margins during the second half despite the
impact of devaluation on raw material costs. This continues to be a soundly
profitable area of our business.'
The US beds operation incurred losses in a much more volatile market, with
sales down 11 per cent to Pounds 8.45m. Mr Davies said: 'We do now see an
upturn in its fortunes as we concentrate on higher-margin sales and we
anticipate internal improvement aided by the economic recovery which is now
starting.'
The UK cabinets businesses encountered mixed fortunes in spite of a 16 per
cent increase in sales to Pounds 37m. The group said Homeworthy, its largest
cabinet business, increased profits by more than 20 per cent. However, the
result from Silentnight Cabinets was significantly below expectations, with
disrupted production because of a factory extension leading to higher costs.
Westminster Pine also continued to find it difficult to increase turnover
profitably.
Houben, a German bed and mattress manufacturer bought last May, made an
eight-month profit contribution of Pounds 879,000.
Earnings fell 4 per cent to 17.14p (17.84p). An unchanged final dividend of
5.75p maintains the total at 8p.
COMMENT
Silentnight's shares rose 7p to 302p as these results were ahead of
expectations. The group struck a cautious note on its trading outlook, but
seems well poised to benefit from any sustained upturn in consumer
confidence. Pressure on prices has been intense, but new models and higher
orders from recent trade shows suggest some scope for rebuilding margins.
The group gives no divisional split of profits, but the problems in cabinets
seems limited to the US and one-off factory extension at Silentnight
Cabinets. Analysts believe earnings could advance 20 per cent in the current
year, putting the shares on a prospective multiple of under 15, a slight
discount to the market. Despite having risen by nearly 60 per cent since
September, the shares could have further bounce left in them.

FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Berisford recruits takeover specialist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DENIS MULHALL is leaving Tomkins, the conglomerate, to join Berisford
International, the property and agriculture group, as finance director. He
is expected to take up the appointment in the summer.
Mr Mulhall's most recent job within Tomkins was at Ranks Hovis McDougall,
the milling, baking and grocery products company which Tomkins acquired at
the end of last year.
Mr Mulhall's role at Tomkins was as one of the team which integrated the
guns-to-lawnmowers group's acquisitions. He had been working in the US
integrating Philips Industries, bought in 1990 for Dollars 550m, before
returning to the UK five months ago to work at RHM. His experience is likely
to be of benefit at Berisford which is expected to be an acquisitive
company. It is currently proposing a Pounds 184m bid for C&amp;J Clark, the
private shoe company.
Mr Mulhall said that he was leaving Tomkins with 'great sadness' but would
have a broader role at Berisford. He was not a main board director at
Tomkins. He said the performance of RHM was 'in no way a reason for
leaving'. The move to Berisford was 'a wonderful opportunity', he said. He
had not known Mr Alan Bowkett, Berisford's chief executive, before and was
originally approached by headhunters acting for Berisford.
Berisford's proposals will be put to Clark's shareholders at a special
meeting on Friday, May 7. Berisford is expected today to make a final appeal
to Clark's shareholders to vote in favour of the deal.
Mr Mulhall said the move to buy Clark was very exciting. 'Clark has a
tremendous brand name which has been under-utilised.'

FT  05 MAY 93 / BT discussions on EDS share stake called off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecom and Electronic Data Systems, America's largest computing
services company, are understood to have called off discussions which could
have meant BT buying a large stake in EDS, a subsidiary of General Motors.
The two companies yesterday declined to comment but they are believed to
have been unable to agree on the financial terms of a deal, and particularly
on the degree of control to be wielded by BT.
The British company does not want to take stakes in businesses where it does
not have control, while neither GM nor EDS appear to have been happy to
yield much power to BT.
The discussions are said to have included the possibility of BT purchasing a
25 per cent stake in GM's class E shares, which are linked to the
profitability of EDS. This would have cost BT around Dollars 4bn at current
market prices.
However, the class E shares do not give the holder a stake in EDS's assets,
which remain 100 per cent owned by GM, and this appears to have been a
significant stumbling block to any deal.
The termination of talks poses a substantial strategic challenge for BT,
which is anxious to expand its presence in the North American telecoms
market, the world's largest, to support its drive to be a leading global
business.
It has a fledgling network management business, called Syncordia, based in
Atlanta, Georgia, but a tie-up with EDS would have given it much more clout
in the US market and potential access to customers.
EDS, for its part, could have bolstered its European presence through a link
with BT. The Dallas-based company, which operates in more than 30 countries,
sees Europe as a key area of growth over the coming decade. Some 25 per cent
of its revenues currently come from international markets.
It is also keen to strike up alliances with one or more international
telecommunications groups to take advantage of the convergence of the
computing and telecommunications sectors in a much larger information
technology industry.
The sale of a large stake could have provided GM with cash for investment in
new automobile models, or to reduce its unfunded pension liabilities.
However, EDS is one of the group's fastest growing and most profitable
businesses and helps offset red ink in GM's North American vehicle
operations.
GM 'E' shares closed last night down Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 30 3/8 in
response to the termination of the BT talks.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Missiles industry locks on new course: The move to joint
ventures in Europe's arms sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE rationalisation of Europe's defence industry yesterday gathered speed
with confirmation that British Aerospace and Matra of France are in advanced
negotiations to merge their guided weapons activities into a joint company.
At last September's Farnborough Air Show, Mr Noel Forgeard, head of the
Matra conglomerate's core defence and space activities, was insisting that
'in the missiles business, something has to be done'. At the time, Matra had
started talks with BAe about a possible link of their respective guided
weapons activities. This led to the proposal to form a joint company with
annual sales of more than Pounds 1bn and employing 8,000 people. It would be
big enough to compete against larger US missiles manufacturers.
'It is impossible to avoid a restructuring of the missile industry in Europe
in the face of what has happened in the US where they are regrouping into
gigantic companies,' a Matra official said yesterday.
The Cold War spawned more companies in Europe and the US making missiles or
systems for missiles than could survive in an age of diminishing government
defence budgets.
In the US, a reshuffle of the industry has begun in earnest, with Loral's
takeover of the former LTV group's guided weapons activities and the sale of
General Dynamics' powerful missiles division to Hughes Aircraft, part of
General Motors.
Hughes and Raytheon, makers of the Patriot, the ground-to-air defence
missile used in the Gulf war, are in a class of their own by sheer size,
setting a challenge to medium-sized manufacturers on both sides of the
Atlantic.
Cross-border collaboration on a variety of weapons in Europe, designed to
pool expertise and meet the high cost of developing new systems, has proved
only a partial solution. Agreements have often proved fragile and
contentious, with too many collaborative ventures competing for a shrinking
market.
In the late 1980s, BAe and Matra became increasingly aware of the need to
forge more stable cross-border partnerships with other European
manufacturers through joint venture companies and equity links.
BAe, which launched a sweeping restructuring of its Dynamics missiles
division in 1988, first attempted to forge an Anglo-French missiles merger
in 1989 with Thomson-CSF, the French state-controlled defence group.
The merger of BAe's and Thomson-CSF's missiles activities would have created
Europe's biggest guided weapons company called Eurodynamics. But the deal
collapsed after negotiations were delayed for more than a year by monopoly
investigations.
BAe sees Matra providing a new opportunity to forge an Anglo-French missiles
merger. The original plan was to build on a takeover of BAe's space
activities by Matra Marconi Space, a joint venture between Matra and
GEC-Marconi of the UK. But the two sides could not agree on a price and the
takeover fell through. That did not prevent the two companies continuing and
intensifying discussions on the missiles front.
For Matra, BAe offered a chance to establish a joint venture company which
could be widened to embrace other French, British and German companies.
Through a joint venture company with BAe, Matra sees an opportunity to take
a leading part in a much-mooted reorganisation of the industry in France,
possibly including Germany's Deutsche Aerospace, the aerospace and defence
arm of Daimler-Benz. Matra, which otherwise risked playing a secondary role
to Aerospatiale and Thomson-CSF in the current French plans to rationalise
its missiles industry, will considerably strengthen its negotiating position
if it quickly finalises an agreement with BAe.
Both BAe and Matra said yesterday that their products were largely
complementary, with BAe strong in air-to-air missiles and Matra in
ground-to-air weapons. The main conflict of interest between Matra and BAe
is in medium-range air-to-air missiles: the French company's Mica and a new
'fire-and-forget' version of BAe's Sky Flash.
In January, Mr John Weston, managing director of BAe's defence activities,
confirmed he was looking for strategic partners: 'Quite obviously there are
some significant international movements at the moment in the consolidation
of the industry. If we can find the right joint ventures, with the right
sort of financial structure that suits everybody's shareholders, then yes,
we are open for joint ventures.'
But a BAe-Matra agreement could set the stage for even broader
rationalisation of the UK guided weapons industry. Matra has already raised
the possibility of further 'vertical integration' which might include
GEC-Marconi, the traditional supplier of guided systems for BAe missiles.
GEC-Marconi has its own whole-system missile business, a secretive venture
it bought from Ferranti International, with a lucrative contract for Abu
Dhabi. But its ambitions to evolve into a leading prime contractor for
guided weapons have so far failed to bear fruit.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Lasmo compensates former chief executive with Pounds 2.2m
pay-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHRIS Greentree, who was replaced as chief executive of Lasmo, the
lossmaking independent oil company, last January, has received a pay-off
totalling Pounds 2.2m. Under an agreement announced yesterday, the
Canadian-born executive is also to receive Pounds 44,000 to cover
repatriation and other expenses.
Lasmo said it is paying Mr Greentree Dollars 1,233,500 (Pounds 785,000) for
loss of office. He had two years of a three-year contract to run.
He will also receive the benefit of various insurance policies and pension
entitlements which are expected to provide him with a pension of Dollars
189,000 a year. The value of the insurance policies, built up over 10 years,
is about Dollars 2.2m. The existence of the policies had not previously been
disclosed, a spokeswoman for the company said yesterday.
Mr Greentree was ousted from Lasmo after the company reported a loss of
Pounds 385m and cut its dividend due to heavy borrowing costs. In his last
year at the company he was paid a total of Pounds 480,647 including a Pounds
50,000 performance bonus, an increase of 40 per cent.
After his departure, senior Lasmo executives took a 5 per cent pay cut. Mr
Greentree's successor, Mr Joe Darby, was to be paid Pounds 200,000, the
company said at the time.
Mr Greentree's payment exceeds the deal agreed between British Petroleum and
its former chief Mr Bob Horton, who left the company last summer. Mr Horton
received a Pounds 1.5m package of compensation and pension entitlements.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Japanese banks step up action to rescue Kumagai: Second top
executive is transferred to restructure ailing property group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan will send the head of its London branch
back to Tokyo to oversee the restructuring of international operations at
Kumagai Gumi, the Japanese contractor and property developer, burdened by
about Y700bn (Pounds 4.1bn) in debt.
LTCB's move follows the transfer of an executive at Sumitomo Bank to assist
in the restructuring of Kumagai's domestic operations, hurt by the collapse
of Japanese property prices and by its own financial exposure to
unsuccessful resort developments.
The joint effort by the two leading Japanese banks highlights the
seriousness of the situation at Kumagai, which has struggled in domestic and
international markets to meet a goal, set last year, of selling Y300bn in
properties over five years to reduce its debt.
Mr Yasunori Fujii, general manager of LTCB's London branch, is expected to
return to Japan at the end of this week and be formally appointed senior
managing director of Kumagai, responsible for international business, at a
board meeting next month.
LTCB officials said the bank has become involved because it backed some of
Kumagai's ventures and has a small shareholding in the company, which had an
envied reputation in the Japanese industry in the 1980s as a successful
international contractor.
But the company has begun to retreat from the international market, and over
the past three years overseas receipts have fallen from 25 per cent to 8 per
cent of sales.
Kumagai has already been forced to sell cherished assets, including a
self-developed office complex in Reading, Berkshire, sold in late March for
a reported Y7.7bn.
It has also raised funds by reducing a stake in the increasingly independent
Kumagai Gumi (Hong Kong), which is particularly successful in the Chinese
market.
Three years ago, Kumagai had a 35 per cent stake in the Hong Kong company,
but that will be reduced to just over 6 per cent under an agreement
announced last month.
The transfer of bank staff is the preferred Japanese method of restructuring
an ailing company, as it sends a clear signal to other creditors that the
banks have no intention of allowing the company in question to collapse.
However, the lead banks are expected to accept a reduction in interest
payments on their own exposure to the troubled company.
Kumagai has been more vulnerable than other Japanese contractors because of
its strategy of taking an active role in the venture financing.
The company has also suffered because of close links to the Shuwa property
and stock speculation group, which is also being restructured.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Sturge closes eight Lloyd's syndicates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STURGE HOLDINGS, the biggest group of Lloyd's agencies, yesterday surprised
the London insurance market by closing eight syndicates - including two of
the market's largest - and dismissing 40 staff.
The closures are part of a rationalisation geared to improve efficiency,
strengthen management and attract fresh capital - including corporate
investors - to Sturge's remaining 15 syndicates. They follow the
announcement last week by Lloyd's of its new business plan, which aims to
guide the market back to profitability.
'We have carried out an effective cull and tied our thinking in with the
business plan,' said Mr Terry Hayday, chief executive.
The group, which is chaired by the former Lloyd's chairman, Mr David
Coleridge, announced the resignation of its finance director, Mr Peter
Davis, earlier this year and has now sacked 170 of its 1,320 staff since
September.
The closure has caused consternation among brokers who suggested the
market's capacity to accept business could be adversely affected since both
syndicates 206 and 210 were regarded as leaders in marine and United States
non-marine business respectively, often accepting large individual risks on
their own account.
'It is terrifying that a group of that size could do something so radical,'
said one London broker. 'Capacity will be tight all round.'
Mr Hayday said that each of the eight axed syndicates had performed poorly
in 1990 and in some earlier years and were unlikely to be able to attract
support, either from Names - the individuals whose assets currently back
Lloyd's - or new corporate investors.
Syndicate 206 lost Pounds 61.53m (compared with capacity of Pounds 175.8m),
while syndicate 210 also faces a deficit of Pounds 68.06m (capacity of
Pounds 183.97m). The six other axed syndicates also incurred losses in 1990:
they are 203, 209, 428, 212, 782, and 950.
The losses reflected poor trading conditions generally although syndicate
782's losses reflected Pounds 3.4m in claims from a scheme to compensate
local authorities for employing supply teachers to cover for sick
colleagues.
Mr Hayday said he hoped to stem the decline in the agency's capacity to its
present level of Pounds 725m by attracting fresh corporate capital.

FT  05 MAY 93 / GPA to talk with holders of bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA GROUP is to negotiate with its bondholders after its board yesterday
discussed new restructuring options including a plan aimed at swapping more
than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in unsecured debt into equity.
The financially troubled aircraft leasing company is expected formally to
start talking with its bondholders at the end of the week.
The decision effectively marks the end of its current restructuring plan
which excluded the possibility of asking bondholders to make concessions.
However, GPA's failure to raise new equity at Dollars 1 a share means its
lenders will not allow it to pay the Dollars 220m of bonds that mature in
May and June.
Its banks are now expected to give it a further temporary waiver of breaches
on its banking covenants on Friday on the understanding that talks with
bondholders take place.
One lead banker said: 'GPA realises it has to do a deal with its
bondholders, which will close the door on the future possibility of raising
money from the capital markets.'
In a separate move the group is expected to promote Mr Phil Bolger, who runs
the leasing business, and Mr Patrick Blaney, chief operating officer, to its
main board.
Lenders to the group are concerned a split could occur between middle
management, which is effectively running the business, and senior directors
involved in the restructuring.
While some bankers would like to see the early departure of Mr Tony Ryan,
chairman and founder, there has been no co-ordinated pressure from lenders
for a change in GPA's top posts.
The group had hoped to make one further attempt to raise equity from new
investors after most banks agreed in principle to defer Dollars 1bn of debt
repayments until 1996.
However, the few outside shareholders who expressed interest in taking new
shares said GPA should seek concessions from bondholders.
General Electric has been in discussions with GPA about the possibility of
buying assets and taking warrants to subscribe for new shares at a later
date. But the US company has not been willing to take part in the
convertible preference share issue on GPA's terms.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Guidelines on defence sales kept from MPs for a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIAL guidelines governing the export of defence-related equipment to
Iran and Iraq were kept from parliament for almost a year, it emerged
yesterday.
The arms-for-Iraq inquiry heard that ministers decided in 1984 that details
of new guidelines should only be allowed to 'trickle out' to parliament to
minimise any disruption to trade with Iraq and relations generally with the
Arab world.
That decision was revealed on the first day of public hearings in the
inquiry which was prompted by the collapse of the Matrix-Churchill case in
which three former directors of the company were accused of illegally trying
to export arms-making equipment to Iraq. The inquiry was set up to
investigate whether official guidelines were breached with the knowledge or
complicity of the government.
In a forceful exchange, Lord Justice Scott, who is heading the inquiry,
asked a former senior Foreign Office official whether he thought it right
that official guidelines governing defence-related sales to Iraq and Iran
should have been kept from parliament for nearly a year.
Mr Stephen Day, a former head of the Foreign Office's Middle East desk,
denied that he had received any instructions that policy should be kept
secret.
But he confirmed that a decision had been taken by ministers in November
1984 that new guidelines governing exports to Iran and Iraq should be
revealed only incrementally to parliament.
The guidelines, which restricted the export of defence equipment that might
significantly enhance or exacerbate the Iran-Iraq war, were drawn up after
the foreign office expressed concern about the amount of defence-related UK
material reaching the Gulf.
The inquiry heard that a recommendation by Sir Richard Luce, then foreign
office minister of state, that the new guidelines should be announced
'robustly and positively' to the House of Commons and in briefings to the
media was never adopted.
Instead, the guidelines were announced in stages in response to
parliamentary questions between April and October 1985.
Earlier, Sir Richard said his department had found it increasingly difficult
to defend an unannounced policy in the early 1980s that only 'non-lethal
equipment' could be sold to Iran and Iraq.
His view was that the guidelines needed to be made more restrictive as they
were open to abuse. 'We found this a grey area . . . different ministers
could form different opinions about what was lethal and what was not
lethal,' he said.
Without being drawn on specific examples, Sir Richard said that if policy
differences were not resolved between departments, it was the then prime
minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, who took the final decision.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Sir Roy Watts found dead in Thames
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BODY of Sir Roy Watts, chairman of Thames Water, was recovered from the
River Thames yesterday, nearly a week after he disappeared.
As a postmortem examination began to establish the cause of death, former
colleagues paid tribute to his career in the water and civil aviation
industries.
Mr John Bellak, chairman of Severn Trent Water, said Sir Roy had been a
driving force behind the privatisation of the water industry. 'He had a
major part in sparking things off, having felt that government control
didn't do anyone any good,' said Mr Bellak.
Scotland Yard said yesterday that a Thames barge spotted the body at 8.47am
at Kings Reach, about 50 yards from Westminster Bridge. It was taken by a
police boat to Poplar Mortuary where it was identified by dental records.
Police said the body, which was partly decomposed, had been in the water for
'some days'. They added that they were not treating the cause of death as
suspicious.
Sir Roy, 67, had last been seen at 2pm on Tuesday, April 27, when his driver
took him from Thames' central London offices to his Battersea flat. Thames
said it believed Sir Roy had been diagnosed on April 13 as having
Parkinson's Disease. His wife, speaking from the family's Oxfordshire home,
said he had suspected the illness for months.
Water industry colleagues added that he had nevertheless seemed depressed at
the diagnosis, which was compounded by the death of his close friend and
former colleague in aviation, Mr Charles Stuart, on April 6. Before joining
Thames in 1983, Sir Roy was chief executive and deputy chairman of British
Airways where, with Mr Stuart, he helped launch the 'shuttle' concept.
Mr Mike Hoffman, Thames' chief executive, said yesterday that Sir Roy had
already told the board that he would 'hang up his boots' at the company's
annual general meeting in July because of his age and health worries.
Thames is expected to announce a new chairman - an internal appointment -
within days. An inquest opens tomorrow at Poplar coroners court.

FT  05 MAY 93 / US, France agree Bosnia tactics: Possible Serb rejection of
peace plan discussed by Major and Balladur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and France yesterday agreed that a large United Nations peacekeeping
force must be sent to Bosnia rapidly if the Bosnian Serb assembly approves
an international peace plan at its meeting today, but made no final decision
on what action to take if the plan was rejected.
After talks in Paris with Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state,
Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, claimed there was 'a broad
convergence of views' between Paris and Washington on tactics, even if the
assembly rejected the plan.
In that event, 'new measures will have to be taken, and nothing is
excluded', Mr Juppe said in an apparent reference to US ideas on air strikes
against Bosnian Serb supply lines and other military targets. He seemed to
concede that military threats constituted useful pressure on the Bosnian
Serb parliament's meeting, even though France would clearly be reluctant to
see its 5,500 peacekeepers in former Yugoslavia put at risk by air attacks.
After talks in Downing Street last night with Mr John Major, the prime
minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, his French counterpart, said the two
governments' views on what could be done should the Bosnian Serb assembly
reject the peace agreement were close. But, apart from stressing they had
reviewed all options, neither he nor Mr Major would disclose their
preferences.
Although Mr Major said 'we have never ruled out air strikes', a French
official said later that the two premiers had shown a 'common reticence'
about US proposals to bomb Bosnian Serb supply lines.
Reports from Pale, the seat of the Bosnian Serb assembly, suggest its
members are split over whether to endorse the peace plan signed by their
leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, on Sunday, in spite of thinly veiled warnings
by western powers that they risk bombing raids if they reject it.
There are no signs on the ground that the Bosnian Serbs are prepared to
implement a ceasefire ahead of their assembly's decision.
Bosnia's Moslems yesterday accused Serb forces of launching a fierce
artillery attack on the eastern enclave of Zepa and of burning villages on
the town's outskirts. They called for an urgent meeting of the UN Security
Council to discuss measures to save the besieged town.
Serb forces later denied they had started the fighting.
In a letter to Mr Yuli Vorontsov of Russia, the UN Security Council
president, President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia urged the council to
declare Zepa a UN protected area and to send a company of UN troops to
'defend' it and the civilian population.
Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN peace mediator, said he would ask Mr Karadzic and
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to investigate and stop the fighting in
the town.
Meanwhile, plans for a large multinational peacekeeping force of up to
75,000 men to implement a peace agreement once it has been endorsed are due
to be discussed by Nato's military committee in Brussels today.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Sharp fall in US leading index prompts warning on recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US recovery is 'not solid', the White House warned yesterday, after the
index of leading indicators posted its sharpest fall since the official end
of the recession two years ago.
The commerce department said the index, which is designed to give advance
warning of economic trends, fell 1 per cent between February and March, more
than financial markets expected.
However, early figures for car and retail sales last month painted a
brighter picture. Analysts said sales of domestically produced cars appeared
to be running at an annualised rate of 7.0m in the last 10 days of April, up
from 6.6m in the same period of March. Surveys also pointed to a rebound in
retail sales after bad weather depressed sales in March.
President Bill Clinton said the leading index figures reinforced the case
for quick enactment of his deficit-cutting bill. Keeping the deficit down
was the best investment government could make and the best route to lower
interest rates, he said.
Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, blamed slower US growth
on 'worldwide economic softness' and lack of investment during 12 years of
Republican rule.
The sharp fall in the index followed a rise of 0.5 per cent between January
and February. Nine of 11 components of the index fell, led by a drop in
permits for home construction, an increase in claims for state unemployment
insurance and a shrinkage of the average working week.
Ms Gail Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board, a New York business
analysis group, said growth would decline to an annual rate of only 1 per
cent in the second quarter, against 1.8 per cent in the first quarter and
4.7 per cent at the end of last year.
The second quarter slowdown would reflect companies' efforts to run down
excessive stocks built up in recent months as a result of falling demand,
she said. Growth, however, was likely to recover in the second half of the
year.
The fall in the leading index follows a report on Monday of a sharp fall
last month in the Purchasing Managers' Index, a barometer of conditions in
manufacturing industry.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Scott inquiry told that arms guidelines 'trickled out'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECRECY which may have governed Whitehall policy-making in the 1980s was
raised yesterday on the first day of public hearings in the arms-for-Iraq
inquiry.
The inquiry was announced by the government in November in the midst of
public controversy over an alleged secret policy.
In a forceful exchange, Lord Justice Scott, who is heading the inquiry,
asked a former senior foreign office official whether he thought it right
that official guidelines governing defence-related sales to Iraq and Iran
should have been kept from parliament for nearly a year.
Lord Justice Scott asked Mr Stephen Day, a former head of the foreign
office's Middle East desk: 'Looking at the map more broadly would you not
say that the British public and parliament were entitled to know about these
important matters . . . to know about the guidelines?'
Mr Day denied that he had personally received any instructions that policy
should be kept secret. But he confirmed that a decision had been taken by
ministers in November 1984 that new guidelines governing exports to Iran and
Iraq should only be allowed to 'trickle out' to parliament to minimise any
disruption they might have on trade with Iraq and relations generally with
the Arab world.
The guidelines, which restricted the export of defence equipment that might
significantly enhance or exacerbate the Iran-Iraq war, were drawn up after
the foreign office expressed concern about the amount of defence-related UK
material finding its way to the Gulf.
However, the inquiry heard that a recommendation by Sir Richard Luce, then
foreign office minister of state, that the new guidelines should be
announced 'robustly and positively' to the House of Commons and in briefings

Instead the guidelines were announced in stages in response to parliamentary

Without being drawn on any specific examples, Sir Richard said that if
policy differences were not resolved between departments, it was the then
prime-minister, Mrs Thatcher, who took the final decision.
Previously-classified Whitehall documents released during the the trial last
year of three former directors of Matrix-Churchill, the machine tool
company, showed that British ministers agreed in 1989 to withhold from
parliament revised rules banning the sale of defence-related equipment to
Iraq.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US index of leading indicators has occasionally proved so misleading
that one should not set too much store by March's 1 per cent fall. Storms
and blizzards had a generally depressing effect on economic indicators for
that month. More worrying is Monday's fall in the purchasing managers' index
which suggests that there was no rebound in April. If Friday's employment
figures also turn out weak, it will be hard to escape the conclusion that
the recovery has gone awry.
More surprising is that the latest data has not put the dollar under greater
pressure. Though the dollar has fallen nearly 10 pfennigs since early March,
the currency market seems reluctant to abandon the positive view with which
the year began. This had the dollar rallying sharply on the back of a strong
US recovery, offset by recession and lower interest rates in Germany.
So far, only part of this expectation has been fulfilled. Germany has moved
deeper into recession and the Bundesbank is cutting rates, albeit
cautiously. The D-Mark is no longer a haven for those disillusioned with the
US recovery. The quest for an alternative may help explain the strength of
gold. But that also means the dollar is being supported by D-Mark weakness,
a phenomenon which cannot last indefinitely, especially now the Clinton
honeymoon is fading.

FT  05 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: BT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BT seems to be cast in the role of perpetual bridesmaid in the US telecoms
business. The company was engaged to McCaw only to see the cellular operator
marry AT&amp;T. It has also walked out with IBM and the US long-distance
companies MCI and Sprint. Latterly, BT cuddled up to the computer company
EDS, but the latter's attempts to divorce General Motors to move in with BT
seem to have proved too messy.
The difficulty in finding a suitable partner raises questions about BT's
strategy. A desire to take part in the world's largest telecommunications
market is understandable. Yet, if it were to attempt a link-up with one of
the large US long distance operators such as MCI or Sprint, it would face
large regulatory problems. Ties to the regional 'Baby Bells' might be less
controversial, but being restricted to the areas around Atlanta or San
Francisco might feel a little cramped. Buying computer companies would
certainly be easier, but the telecommunications benefits are more nebulous
and Byzantine arguments are needed to justify such deals. BT may chip away
at the US market if it gets permission to lease capacity and resell it to
other customers, but that hardly provides the critical mass for a serious
North American challenge.
One engine of BT's ambition is its financial strength. Yet it appears unable
to use its balance sheet or swelling cash flow effectively in Europe or in
the US. Perhaps it should widen its gaze and consider participation in basic
telephony elsewhere, or even other areas such as credit card processing or
smart card development in the UK. If all else fails, subscribers to BT3 will
welcome the higher dividend payments that the limits of imperial ambition
would bring.

There is a traditional military logic in a merger between the missile
businesses of British Aerospace and Matra. The two companies have roughly
complementary weapons systems and sell into different geographical markets.
Where they do overlap, they can stop competing aggressively and cutting each
other's margins, where they do not, they will have a chance to cross-sell
systems. As is the way with such military deals, the rationale contains
little about saving money. Joint marketing may save some cash, but
manufacturing capacity will probably have to be maintained. If a merger
would not provide any of the financial benefits normally associated with
rationalisation, it is at least a sensible response to shrinking European
defence spending.
The combined missile business would be better able to challenge DASA, Hughes
and Raytheon for what business is going. Presumably, both parties have also
ensured that Aerospatiale would not be able to pressure the French
government into an all-French ordering policy. And the mooted deal confirms
the new BAe management's reputation for hitting the target. What remains
unclear, though, is whether either party is using the merger talks as a way
to sidle out of the missile business. That still looks unlikely, but such
joint ventures do provide the ideal cover.

FT  05 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Turbulence at GPA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA is at last having to realise that survival depends on more than cramming
a first class cabin with classy non-executive directors such as Lord Lawson
and Sir John Harvey-Jones. These failed to prevent its financial crisis. But
the looming payments on GPA's bond issues leave little time for
recriminations. After its failure to sell new equity even at Dollars 1 a
share, a deal with bond holders, if one can be agreed, is only part of the
solution. The size of GPA's bank debt means it must still find a new source
of equity. Otherwise it will be difficult to scale down its business in an
orderly way.
Lending to GPA will go down as another error of judgment by international
banks who were initially attracted by the security it offered. This was
important after the developing country debt crisis of the early 1980s. But
the banks fell into two traps akin to those that snared them in property
lending. They vastly overestimated the demand for new aircraft and their
obsession with security led them to pay too little attention to GPA's cash
flow.
GPA is now, however, so big that it needs to be kept going to prevent havoc
in the aircraft market. The pain of collapse would be felt not only by
manufacturers who have already seen their orders slashed. The forced sale of
GPA's fleet would erode still further the value of the banks' security. Then
there is the additional problem of the partnership leases which depend on
GPA continuing as a going concern. Whatever the solution, it would be
preferable to find a way of ensuring that GPA's existing managers can
continue to run the day-to-day leasing operation. They have acquitted
themselves well in this regard - which cannot be said about the board's
involvement with grander strategy.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Europe cut down to size: Alan Cane examines the likely
consequences of significant retrenchment by IBM in a leading market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The gloomiest entry in International Business Machines' catalogue last year
came under the heading of western Europe. In a collapse both sudden and
shocking, IBM's most profitable region in 1990 had become, in only two
years, a salesman's nightmare.
Purchases of mainframe computers and large memory systems declined steeply
towards the end of the year, contributing substantially to the computer
company's Dollars 5.46bn fourth-quarter operating loss and its overall loss
in 1992 of almost Dollars 5bn. This year started no better. Revenues
declined by 14 per cent in Europe in the first quarter compared with a
decline of only 3 per cent in the US and Asia.
Europe, however, is now the world's largest information technology (IT)
market with a value last year estimated at more than Dollars 150bn. For IBM,
the challenge of turning its recent poor performance into an effective
product and distribution strategy has the added bonus that the region could
serve as a model for its global recovery.
At the moment, however, IBM is chiefly concerned with trimming
('downsizing') operations worldwide to match reduced sales expectations,
cutting staff and closing plants. This will be one of the first tasks facing
Mr Jerome York, recently hired as IBM's new finance chief from Chrysler
motor company, who has a reputation as a cost-cutter.
According to Mr Jack Kuehler, IBM vice-chairman, Europe must take a fair
share of the restructuring measures: 'We are downsizing ourself in all the
countries in which we operate, not just those in Europe. We are trying to be
even-handed in downsizing across all the geographies in which we do
business, but there is no way of treating one region significantly different
to another when you are trying to downsize your company.'
The clear implication is that western Europe will not be treated as a
special case despite the size of its market and its importance to IBM's
recovery plans. So what are the likely consequences of significant
retrenchment by IBM? The US company, the world's largest computer maker, is,
after all, the dominant force in European IT, with total IBM sales of
Dollars 25bn last year. Sales of computing services were more than Dollars
2.5bn, making it the only company with more than 5 per cent of the European
market.
It employs about 100,000 and operates 11 manufacturing plants in six
countries. There are 12 research and development facilities, including
telecommunications research at La Gaude in France and applications software
development at Warwick in the UK. Four scientific centres cover topics
including scientific computing in Rome and applied mathematics in Paris.
The first signs of IBM's retrenchment in production are evident. Some 10,000
jobs are to go in western Europe this year, 2,600 of them in manufacturing.
The company has in the past three months formally abandoned its
time-honoured policy of setting up identical manufacturing operations in the
US, Europe and Asia. Mr Kuehler said: 'The trade-off from manufacturing in
three regions is that you can carry out development and manufacturing in the
countries you serve. But it leads to excess capacity which in today's world,
we cannot afford.'
Four European plants - Havant in the UK, a division of the Montpellier
installation in France, Valencia in Spain and Jarfalla in Sweden - have been
told they are only to remain open as 'independent business units' run by
their local managements. If they do not make a profit in 12 months they will
close.
IBM's cool appraisal of the viability of its European plants is a break with
its recent past. For two decades the company has tried to show that it is a
'good European' with local roots. It has lobbied, often successfully, to be
allowed to take part in research programmes aimed at improving the quality
of European technology. Its rigorous attention to detail has helped improve
the quality of the output of European components suppliers.
Will, therefore, retrenchment damage Europe's technological infrastructure?
Mr Michel Carpentier, director-general for IT industries at the European
Commission, does not think the danger should be overstated. He says there is
no sign that IBM intends to reduce its investment in Europe in a
heavy-handed fashion.
The emphasis on downsizing might be a good omen for Europe's small and
medium-sized companies which could compete in software and systems
engineering without the need for heavy investment. He is concerned, however,
that manufacturing might be transferred to developing countries with adverse
consequences for jobs in Europe.
Industry observers also play down the threat. Mr Glenn Cuthbertson,
vice-president and services director at the Gartner Group, a US consultancy,
sees IBM's downsizing as a form of creative destruction: 'It will release in
Europe a lot of poorly used assets,' he says. 'We are not witnessing the
break-up of a successful company. We are seeing the coming apart of a very
inefficient producer of IT goods and services. It should be a net plus for
the European economy.'
As for IBM's sponsorship of academic research, the view is that a dash of
realism can do nothing but good. 'Some of those guys,' one executive said,
'did not know that IBM is a commercial company.'
An important factor is that Europe seems at last to be set for growth in
computing. According to Mr Dennis Exton of Merrill Lynch, the US brokerage
house, the European IT market will grow by 6.8 per cent in 1994 compared
with a forecast of 4.3 per cent this year.
A result will be that good ex-IBM staff will have no difficulty finding
jobs. Mr Cuthbertson argues: 'IBM is already seeing a level of attrition
that it does not want. It is losing bright young salesmen with two or three
years' experience who are going off to work for competitors. In a couple of
years there will be a substantial rebalancing of resources. In this coming
decade the factor limiting growth of the IT industry will be the
availability of skilled people.'
Mr Cuthbertson is among those who believe that IBM could bounce back quickly
in Europe. IBM depends heavily on mainframe sales for its profitability and
Europe has few large mainframes.
There are perhaps only 200 very large mainframe sites in Europe compared
with at least 1,000 in the US. How, then, have IBM and other US mainframe
manufacturers found Europe so profitable? By charging more for mainframes
and disk memories in Europe than in the US. The cost of a unit of computing
power was typically 34 per cent more in Europe than in the US through the
1980s. Then as the competitive pressures grew, IBM threw away the price
book. In February, it launched 18 mainframes but did not publish a single
price. That was left to negotiations between the buyer and IBM's sales team.
The result has been a price war between IBM and companies making machines of
similar design - chiefly the Japanese companies Fujitsu and Hitachi and the
US company Amdahl in which Fujitsu has a stake.
In the past two years the European mainframe market has suffered from the
effects of both the recession and the price war. The damage has been
widespread.
Mr Rolf Brillinger, managing director of Comparex, a German computer company
which markets mainframes made by Hitachi, snapped exasperatedly: 'These
companies will have to consider whether it makes sense continually to cut
prices. It is forcing them into losses and reducing the resources available
for research and development.' Comparex, owned by chemicals giant BASF, saw
profits after tax halved last year.
The positive side of the coin is that without a substantial legacy of
mainframe systems to be maintained and supported, Europe is ready to migrate
quickly to information systems based on smaller, less expensive mid-range
computers. The move would benefit smaller companies that have so far found
mainframe computing too costly.
It could also benefit IBM; it has the products and the services staff to
help customers install and run them. Mr Cuthbertson of Gartner says: 'If IBM
focuses on a mid-range strategy and gets it right, it could rebound quickly
in Europe.'

FT  05 MAY 93 / More changes to the letter of the law: Criticism of the
Criminal Justice Act
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bill leading to the Criminal Justice Act formed the legislative
centrepiece of the UK's 1990-91 parliamentary session, although it is safe
to assume that most people were not even dimly aware of its contents.
Respectable, law-abiding citizens do not expect the act's world of criminal
courts, custodial sentences and previous convictions ever to touch their
lives. But public awareness has increased dramatically since new provisions
for linking fines to individual incomes came into force last October, and
some respectable citizens have found themselves fined thousands of pounds
for motoring offences.
Yesterday, amid growing criticism from judges, magistrates and MPs, Mr
Kenneth Clarke, who inherited the act when he become home secretary last
year, announced that a further bill would be introduced to change aspects of
it.
The two areas of reform concern the act's provision for unit fines related
to an individual's ability to pay, and restrictions on courts taking
previous convictions into account when imposing sentences. Many magistrates
believe the October provisions leave them with insufficient flexibility in
sentencing, and several have resigned in protest since they came into
effect.
It is rare for the government to seek to amend an act so soon after it has
come into force. Pressure on Mr Clarke to do so became hard to resist in
March after complaints in a speech by Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice,
that the act was forcing the judiciary into an ill-fitting straitjacket.
Lord Taylor, during a critical speech, related an anecdote about a young
lawyer at a seminar who told a senior judge that, having re-read sections of
the act, he now realised that they did make sense. 'Read it again, you have
obviously misunderstood it,' replied the judge.
Judicial demands for action have been accompanied by mounting political
pressure on Mr Clarke in the face of highly publicised examples of the
peculiarities of the unit fine system. The most celebrated of these involved
a Pounds 1,200 fine on an unemployed man for dropping a crisp packet,
reduced last week to Pounds 48 on appeal.
Bizarre as it appears, both penalties are logical under the unit fine
system. This bands an individual's weekly disposable income from Pounds 4 to
a maximum Pounds 100. Magistrates then multiple the income figure by a
selected number of units to reflect their view of the seriousness of a
particular case. The man accused of dropping the crisp packet faced 12
units. He did not declare his income, and in such cases the maximum Pounds
100 per week income is assumed. When it was established that he was
unemployed, this was reduced to the Pounds 4 minimum.
Mr Clarke believes that the act's principle of linking fines to income is
correct and intends to retain it. But the Pounds 4-Pounds 100 spread will be
narrowed to reduce extreme variations in fine for the same offence. This
will relieve many MPs, who fear respect for the law would be undermined if
better-off people guilty of relatively minor offences felt that they were
being punished for their economic circumstances.
Ministers believe some of the more breathtaking examples of high fines have
arisen because courts have failed to appreciate the discretion available to
them under the unit system. The Magistrates Association, whose
representatives met Mr Clarke yesterday, is sending out new guidelines on
the use of discretion.
Mr Clarke has less sympathy with the act's restrictions on the introduction
of previous convictions. 'I believe that a first-time offender is not the
same as someone who goes out and offends again and again,' he said
yesterday. 'I think courts should be able to take this into account.' He
says the forthcoming changes will be designed to 'make the law work the way
parliament intended when it passed the 1991 act'. Penal reformers and
probation officers fear otherwise.
The 1991 act has at its heart the liberal principle that the punishment of
less-serious offenders should shift from custody to the community.
Unfortunately for supporters of community penalties, however, the
introduction of the act coincided with one of Britain's periodic outbreaks
of anxiety over juvenile offenders. Mr Clarke's response, in spite of the
act's intention to reduce the use of custody, has been to embark on a new
generation of secure schools for 12-15-year-olds.
Penal reform organisations fear yesterday's willingness to amend the act is
further evidence that, in the face of public opinion, the government will
prove reluctant to defend the wider principles on which it is based.

Two peeps behind the scenes of the Californian wine industry recently - one
of a public nature, the other not officially so.
Last week the king of Napa Valley, 80-year-old Robert Mondavi, announced
that his family's winery was making its first share issue. A sobre matter,
however, compared with the publication of a grippingly scurrilous
unauthorised biography of the world's largest wine company built up by
Ernest and Julio Gallo.
In Blood and Wine by Ellen Hawkes, Ernest, in his mid-80s, is portrayed as
the domineering oldest brother who has bullied his way to establishing E&amp;J
Gallo as a secretive, conservatively-run, mass-market wine empire -
achieving sales of around 70m cases worth more than Dollars 1bn a year,
according to trade estimates.
Julio, who suffered a fatal road accident on one of the family's many
ranches at the weekend, was officially in charge of wine-making, but is
painted by Hawkes as a compliant softie. Meanwhile, the baby of the family,
Joseph, was marginalised; even his own small cheese-making efforts were
banned, after a bitter court case, from using the Gallo name.
But so powerful is the Gallo empire, based without so much as a nameplate in
the small California town of Modesto, that this book represents virtually
the first whiff of criticism of a winery more usually associated with its
atmospheric advertisements.

Has no-one told James Sherwood, Sea Containers' ebullient boss, that a
private helipad atop one's building is these days considered, well, a little
vulgar?
The company is seeking planning permission to park its choppers up to 10
times a week on its Blackfriars office roof.
Vulgar or no, it was, however, the practical matter of noise that was on the
minds of American-born Sherwood's neighbours as they trooped along to the
recent two-week inquiry.
Next door is the Oxo tower, where plans for a roof garden restaurant as part
of a big restoration could be dished by the proximity of whirring blades.
Bang opposite is the Inner Temple, whose delegation argued eloquently for
the listed buildings and the right to throw wide the single-glazed windows
in the summer. And 73-year-old Sam Wanamaker, one of Sherwood's fellow
countrymen, who is almost single-handedly trying to resurrect the Globe
Theatre, delivered a rousing peroration on the subject of how the first
Shakespearian words heard on the site since 1644 were well nigh drowned by a
police whirlybird.
But then James Sherwood's Discriminating Guide to London would not have
approved either. This neat little compendium detailing where to imbibe in
the capital - both victuals and culture - published in the mid-1970s was
quite stern about aural intrusion. A section entitled Not For Us included
noisy eateries among the other pariahs.

The resignation of Bjorn Engholm, debonair, pipe-smoking leader of Germany's
Social Democrats, may be a source of regret for women voters, with whom he
was always a big hit. Yet it could be a blessing in disguise for the women's
lobby.
In Schleswig-Holstein, where Engholm was premier, the way is cleared for his
deputy, Heide Simonis, to take over. Currently a no-nonsense finance
minister, she has been much in the public eye as a tough negotiator in the
annual public sector pay round. If elected in this month's polls, she would
become the first woman leader at state level.
But she may not be the only female politician on the up. One name being
mooted as a possible successor to Engholm as SPD leader is that of Renate
Schmidt, the extrovert Bavarian party boss and deputy speaker in the Bonn
parliament. She must be considered an outsider for the job - she claimed
yesterday that she was 'very probably' not in the running - but she would
certainly inject a welcome breath of fresh air into next year's federal
election.
A 49-year-old grandmother from Nuremberg who sports a shock of white curls,
she is a fiery speaker imbued with a touch of south German passion and an
ability to challenge supporters of the male-dominated establishment.

Stand up Antonio Fazio, the new governor of the Bank of Italy, who succeeds
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Italy's new prime minister, as the eighth governor in
the bank's 100-year history.
Age and experience appear to have counted in Fazio's favour over the two
other internal candidates, Lamberto Dini, currently the bank's number two,
and Tommaso Padoa Schioppa, its deputy director general.
Fazio, 57, was the most senior of the threesome, in terms of length of
service at the bank, where he has worked all his life, notably on the
research side, as chief economist. By contrast, both Dini and Padoa Schioppa
have spent periods outside its walls. Dini worked for 17 years at the
International Monetary Fund, while Padoa Schioppa has spent some time at the
European Commission in Brussels.
However, Fazio's star only started rising at a relatively late stage in the
race - especially after suggestions that Dini's powerful political
connections might count against him rather than in his favour. Given the
current pace of political change in Italy, knowing the right people in
politics is no longer such an easy game to play.
In time, the bank may appoint a successor to Fazio as deputy director
general alongside Padoa Schioppa. However, there is no lack of talented
insiders and little sign of a desire to stir the pot.

dissatisfaction with Maastricht, the war in former Yugoslavia, the recession
 -many ordinary voters at present take an unfavourable view of the European
Community. One issue with a direct impact on taxpayers' wallets exacerbates
this poor image: widespread misappropriation of EC cash.
The publicity given to EC fraud, above all connected with payments linked to
the common agricultural policy (CAP), has three effects. It weakens support
among national governments and electorates for necessary increases in the EC
budget. It highlights how the elaborate CAP mechanism for doling out farm
subsidies can provide lucrative rewards for swindlers. And it illustrates
the Community's shortcomings in its struggle against fraudsters in
particular, and cross-border crime in general.
Here, the EC is a long way from adopting a supranational approach. Verifying
that the sometimes absurdly complex system of agricultural hand-outs works
properly is a matter for national authorities, operating often without real
co-operation. Many professional criminals specialising in 'milking' CAP
funds are, on the other hand, well-organised in efficient transnational
networks.
Limit abuse
Possibilities for illegal diversion of EC money will exist as long as the
Community keeps its agricultural prices above world market levels and
compensates farmers who stockpile or export surpluses. Despite the
successful aspects of last year's plan for a partial overhaul of the CAP,
this is a state of affairs with which the EC will have to live for many
years. However, abuse can be limited.
In this regard, the Commission's annual fraud report, published last week,
makes depressing reading. By definition, most fraud is unreported. For 1992,
the Commission records that Ecu118m was purloined from CAP export refund and
price support schemes, with a further Ecu152m lost through evasion of
customs duties and farm levies. Cases cited range from the sidestepping of
levies on olive oil to the filing of dishonest claims for export of cereals,
milk products or livestock. The EC admits that these examples form the tip
of a much larger iceberg. Further, even where wrongdoing is proven, less
than 10 per cent of defrauded funds are recouped.
Financial incentive
One important problem is that national governments have no direct financial
incentive to recover money filched from the Community. Controls are often
lax. Convictions are hampered by the complexity of many of the fraud rings,
and by differing national judicial procedures. Penalties are generally
small. The Community plainly realises the seriousness of the threat. The EC
this year is spending Ecu133m on combating fraud, against Ecu77m in 1992.
Much of the increase is earmarked for improving CAP management and controls.
Greater use is being made of computers, and the EC is resorting to satellite
surveillance of fields to ensure that 'set-aside' schemes do not reap
farmers illicit profits.
Such measures can, at least, act as a powerful deterrent. But more must be
done. The EC Court of Auditors, the Community's spending watchdog, has
proposed setting up an independent EC anti-fraud unit to help tackle the
problem. Such a unit, staffed by financial experts and customs officials,
could operate at arm's length from the court and the Commission, under the
supervision of the European parliament. Drawing on better controls on
consignments on the EC's external borders, more rigorous financial checks,
and pooled intelligence, the unit would have powers to investigate suspected
fraud cases speedily.
This would be a useful innovation, but not a panacea. Judicial authorities
and member governments would still have the responsibility for following up
the unit's work and mounting prosecutions. The Community, however, badly
needs to regain the initiative. If the opportunities for pillaging funds
become as deeply entrenched as the CAP itself, the EC will be in a sorry
state.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Nuclear rift over Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NUCLEAR disarmament was perhaps the most cherished fruit of the end of the
cold war. Presidents George Bush and Boris Yeltsin acknowledged as much when
they signed the Start 2 strategic arms limitation treaty in Moscow last
January. The rest of the world applauded the prospect of a further
significant reduction in the US and ex-Soviet nuclear arsenals, and western
policymakers began turning their minds to the next big disarmament
challenge: that of renewing and strengthening the Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT).
Now it is beginning to look as if everyone relaxed too soon. The Russian
parliament has yet to ratify Start 2. More worrying, neighbouring, newly
independent Ukraine is embroiled in an increasingly acrimonious row with
Russia and the west over the 176 Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles
and 41 nuclear-armed bombers still on its soil.
Without sensitive handling on all sides, the dispute risks upsetting the
international disarmament process and becoming a serious irritant in efforts
to renew the NPT. At worst, it could encourage something the west
desperately wants to prevent: the emergence of a renegade power in the heart
of Europe, clinging to nuclear weapons for lack of what it sees as reliable
security guarantees, and perhaps seeking alliances with other would-be
nuclear states in the Middle East or Asia.
Insensitive handling
Thus far, the west's - and in particular Washington's - handling of the
issue has been anything but sensitive. The Clinton administration has issued
a series of warnings to Ukraine that it will not discuss aid for its
shattered economy or any other bilateral questions until Kiev has ratified
the earlier Start 1 strategic arms treaty and acceded to the NPT. Ukrainian
leaders have been promising to do this since 1991, but parliament has yet to
deliver. The main result of US pressure has been to fuel the growth of
pro-nuclear sentiment among legislators, making it decreasingly likely that
Ukraine will agree to go non-nuclear in the foreseeable future.
How is the impasse to be broken? In exchange for ratification, President
Leonid Kravchuk is demanding substantial western assistance towards the cost
of dismantling the weapons (the US has promised Dollars 175m); payment of
the proceeds from sale of the nuclear fuel they contain; and cast-iron
guarantees of Ukraine's security from Nato powers and from Russia. Western
governments, though some have given security assurances, instinctively jib
at what they see as a form of nuclear blackmail. But their failure to
respond merely reinforces the Ukrainians' inclination to hang on to nuclear
weapons either as a deterrent to Russian adventurism or simply as a means of
ensuring they are taken seriously.
Legitimate concerns
On both these counts Ukraine has legitimate concerns. Russia has
consistently refused to sign a comprehensive political treaty with Ukraine
recognising the inviolability of its frontiers, except in the context of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, the successor body to the USSR of which
Ukraine has said it does not want to be a full member. Moreover, influential
voices in the Russian parliament are frequently heard staking claims to
Ukrainian territory. The potential for instability in Russia is such that
Ukraine has no reason to lower its guard.
This problem is compounded by the impression in Kiev that the west is so
fixated on the need to give political and economic support to Russia that it
is turning a blind eye to Moscow's handling of conflicts with its
neighbours. In allowing that perception to take hold, western governments
have committed a blunder which they may live to regret.
Fortunately, it is not too late to correct the balance. To do so the US
should couple continuing pressure on Kiev over nuclear weapons with equally
firm efforts to persuade Russia to sign a treaty securing Ukraine's
sovereignty and its borders. In addition, other interested parties -
particularly Britain and France as Europe's other nuclear powers - could
adopt a higher profile in the effort to soothe Ukraine's security concerns.
Finally, all involved need to demonstrate convincingly that they are coming
to terms with the emergence of a new European country larger than France,
and that if Ukraine moves down the path of economic reform they are prepared
to assist it as generously as they are helping Russia. That way, Ukraine
will not feel it needs to retain nuclear weapons to hold the world's
attention.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Personal View: The year of the great opportunity - Curing
Italy's economic ills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCO MODIGLIANI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In recent months, Italy has been under the spotlight for all the wrong
reasons: Mafia killings of judges; political scandals involving senior
politicians and business leaders; growing political instability. And yet,
1993 is for Italy 'the year of the great opportunity'. Not only is the
political system finally being reformed, but there is a rare coincidence of
circumstances which makes it possible for Italy to cure the four chronic
diseases of its economy: high inflation, unemployment, horrendous government
deficits and imbalances in its external trade accounts. But this will happen
provided the incoming government sticks to two prescriptions - extending the
1992 wage agreement and remaining outside the European exchange rate
mechanism until conditions are right to re-enter.
The first exceptional circumstance is that Italy is now enjoying the
benefits of the July 1992 agreement among the government, trade unions and
employers, which abolished the country's wage indexation system. The pact
virtually froze nominal wages until the end of 1993. As long as 15 years ago
I identified indexation as the leading cause (together with excessive wage
demands) of the inescapable swing of the Italian pendulum between the high
inflation of the 1970s, and the low growth, rising unemployment, high
external deficit and disinflation of the 1980s, after Italy joined the
European Monetary System.
The second extraordinary circumstance is represented by the free floating of
the lira following the turbulence on the foreign exchange markets of
September 1992. The overvaluation of the lira, caused by the fixed exchange
rate and the persisting inflation differential, eventually led to the
abandoning of the fixed parity. What happened afterwards vindicates the view
expressed last November by Rudi Dornbusch, the MIT economist. He maintained,
in contrast with conventional wisdom, that by floating the lira, Italy had
finally freed itself from the yoke of the Bundesbank and the high interest
rates imposed by it. He said that Italy should use that freedom for a sharp
cut in interest rates and a deep devaluation of up to 30 per cent. A
devaluation of such proportions was needed to balance the current account,
restore growth and job creation, and compensate for the effect of a
reduction of the public deficit of the order of 2 to 3 per cent of GDP.
What actually took place pretty much matches Dornbusch's prescription.
Interest rates on Treasury bills have come down from more than 15 per cent
last summer to about 10 per cent; devaluation reached 30 per cent (though it
has been reduced a bit lately).
The third favourable circumstance is that the devaluation happened at a time
of extremely weak demand, which has helped to bear down on imported
inflation. The moderation of inflation, which in March fell to a six-year
low of 4.2 per cent, is also a consequence of the virtual freeze on nominal
wages.
What Italy is now undergoing is an export-led recovery, with a dramatic
turnround in the current account. The upturn reflects competitiveness gains
which have resulted from devaluation and the wage freeze. As things now
stand, I expect growth to pick up in the second quarter. Italy is likely to
experience a higher rate of growth in 1993 than most European economies.
Is Italy out of the dire straits in which it found itself last September?
Unfortunately, the answer is no. A crucial stage will arrive when the wage
agreement expires at the end of the year. At that point the choice is the
unions'. They could choose to revert to their old ways and attempt to
recover the purchasing power lost since last July, and then some. The result
would be a return to the dilemma between high inflation and a recessionary
tightening.
The other possibility is that the unions will realise the enormous
advantages of extending the agreement. These include:
continued reduction in inflation;
the creation of more secure jobs for present and future generations;
a sharp decline in interest payments.
In spite of the recent reduction, Italian short-term interest rates are
still several percentage points higher than those in the other European
countries. If the markets were reassured that the benefits of the 1992
agreement would be extended to 1994 the conditions are there to take
advantage of high Italian returns. The inflow of capital, a more credible
government (and therefore a reduction of the political risk premium) and the
downward trend of international interest rates should all contribute to a
fall in Italian rates. By year-end, short-term rates could be 5 points lower
than in recent years. Such a reduction would have a significant effect on
the budget. With a debt of L1,600 trillion (million million) I estimate that
a reduction in short-term interest rates by 5 points would bring about a net
saving of L80 trillion by the end of 1994.
Over the same period a further deficit reduction of L50 trillion should come
from:
cuts in public expenditure along the lines pursued by the Amato government;
new measures to curb tax evasion by the self-employed;
higher tax revenues as the economy continues to recover;
privatisation proceeds;
savings from the elimination of corruption on public contracts.
All this would bring the government deficit to 3.3 per cent of GDP, almost
in line with the Maastricht requirements. The fall in interest rates should
also contribute to an increase in investment and, together with the improved
current account, to an expansion in income and employment.
This is what Italy would gain from the extension of the wage agreement. But
union leaders are bound to ask themselves what their members would lose.
With fixed nominal wages, the only possible loss for workers is an increase
in prices. Figures available for the first nine months of the agreement show
a loss of purchasing power only of about 1 per cent. As for the future, even
in the pessimistic assumption that inflation jumps to 6 per cent for the
rest of the year as a consequence of devaluation, the overall loss of
purchasing power would not go beyond 2 per cent. This loss could be easily
compensated by allowing for a rise linked to productivity increases.
Moreover, in 1994, the effect of devaluation on prices will have all but
disappeared.
In exchange for wage moderation, the unions should ask the government for
institutional changes which could contribute to bearing down on price
levels. One of the most urgent is the deregulation of the distribution
sector, whose inefficiency and high profit margins have kept workers from
benefiting fully from productivity gains.
If the unions can be persuaded to make the rational choice and extend the
wage agreement to the end of 1994, I challenge them to announce it right
now. This would bring forward the benefits of the extension, providing the
government and business a stable framework on which to plan. The impact on
job creation would be significant.
What about Italy's return to fixed parities and the monetary union process?
The answer, and here I come to my second prescription, is yes, but only
under the proper conditions.
The question must be seen in a broader context. One might think that the
expansion which Italy is now enjoying is only the result of the fall in the
value of the lira - that is, simply a repetition of the old game of
competitive devaluations. But in fact Italy is now engaged in a rebellion
against the Bundesbank's suicidal policy of high interest rates - acting
like a David against a mighty Goliath. Italy would most definitely welcome
sharing the fight for lower interest rates with other countries with similar
problems, especially in terms of high unemployment, including Spain,
Ireland, Belgium and France. (The UK has already joined the fray.) They too
would have to free themselves from the shackles of the Bundesbank by
floating and pursue a policy of lower interest rates, and possibly tighter
fiscal policies.
The effect of such policies must be favourable to the world economy, because
of the resulting expansion of employment and output. The only possible
exception is Germany, at least until it joins most of the industrialised
world in a policy of lower interest rates, which the Bundesbank has recently
begun to introduce. Once it has been persuaded to correct past errors, the
EMS can quickly get back to the task of economic and monetary union, with
new and better-founded parities, and a healthier distribution of power and
duties.
Indeed, for Italy, and perhaps much of the world, this is the year of the
great opportunity. Let's not miss it.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Letter: Success of UK machine tool makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We noted with interest the article on Holroyd machine tool company
which has just won the Queen's Award for Technological Achievement,
('Cutting and Grinding', April 21).
You say Holroyd is 'One of the few surviving machine tool companies left in
Britain, which once was a world leader in this sector.' This does a
disservice to the many leading companies in our industry. There are about
175 UK makers of machine tools and ancillary equipment, some of which remain
world leaders.
Figures from the Machine Tool Technologies Association show the UK is the
world's eighth largest producer, and seventh largest exporter of machine
tools. The UK exports more machine tools per head employed than any nation
except the Swiss; several of our members have won the Queen's Award for
exports.
The industry has become smaller as its domestic customer base has shrunk.
Conversely this has accounted for the strength of the German and Japanese
industries. It will be interesting to see how they cope with the downturn in
demand that has been regarded as commonplace in the UK.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Letter: Shareholder pressure on pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CLIVE NATHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Having read the letters in the FT on directors' 'over-the-top pay' it
is my opinion that until the full cost of a director is disclosed to
shareholders it may be impossible to address the issue in a proper manner.
After a decade of excess resulting from unreal salary payments supported by
stock options and bonus rewards together with pension contributions and
benefits it seems curious that UK shareholders do not more often group
together by size to activate change from the directors of companies in which
they have invested.
European 'shareholder activists' do not enjoy the exposure and success of
their crusading US counterparts but now is the time to intensify effort.
Perhaps if these programmes gathered momentum, those concerned would suffer
less.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Where conflict is the norm: Fear, not hope, is the force
driving the Middle East peace talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peace is in the air, or at any rate on the air. Tune into the BBC World
Service and you will hear it. In Athens, the warring Bosnian parties have
accepted the Vance-Owen plan. In Washington, there is progress in the Middle
East talks. In Abuja, talks have resumed between the Sudanese government and
the southern 'rebels'. In Somalia, the US has withdrawn and handed over to
the United Nations after an allegedly successful operation.
Perhaps the BBC has been heeding the strictures of one of its employees, Mr
Martyn Lewis, who recently said the news was too uniformly demoralising, and
that more effort should be made to report the positive things that happen in
the world. My answer to such pleas has always been that bad news is in
itself encouraging. The essence of news is that it should be novel, unusual,
surprising. So if disasters make up most of the news, that implies an
assumption that they are not the normal state of affairs.
When news is good, it usually concerns an area or a subject where gloom or
disaster is the long-established norm. Examples: Sadat's visit to Jerusalem
in 1977 (conflict and mutual suspicion were the norm, straightforward human
contact a stunning exception); the non-violent collapse of communism in
eastern Europe; signs of recovery in the British economy.
It is the job of reporters to look out for what is new and report it. The
job of columnists is harder to define, but part of it seems to be to explain
that the news is wrong, or at any rate not what it seems. When the news is
of disaster, the columnist must restore calm by setting it 'in context'. But
when there is news of an exciting breakthrough he must point out all the
problems that remain unresolved.
So this week I could predict with confidence that the wars in Bosnia and
Sudan will go on, and point out that there is still acute insecurity in
Somalia, with no solution in sight. But, having spent the past two days in
and around Jerusalem, I shall concentrate on telling you that there is
little euphoria, among Israelis or Palestinians, about the prospects of
agreement in Washington.
Israelis, as is well known, have always felt insecure about the future of
their state, though less so, I think, since making peace with Egypt in the
late 1970s. Now, however, they feel personally insecure because of the
recurrent and apparently random killings of Israeli citizens by Arabs from
the occupied territories, especially the Gaza Strip.
The authorities have responded by 'sealing off' the territories - which
means that the Arab inhabitants are no longer permitted to enter Israel,
although residents of Israel, Israeli settlers in the territories, and
indeed foreign visitors such as myself, remain free to come and go at will.
The Israeli economy, it seems, has learnt to do without cheap labour from
the territories (although its replacement with cheap labour from places
further afield, such as Thailand, is beginning to cause political
controversy). But the masses cooped up in the Gaza Strip - with one of the
highest birth rates in the world - have little prospect of alternative
employment.
And they have little to lose by engaging in terrorism, since whether they do
or not they are affected by Israel's attempts to control it. Last December,
a 10-year-old girl in Khan Yunis was shot dead in the street, by 'a stray
bullet' from the Israeli army, when she went out to buy milk after the
curfew had been lifted.
For Israeli newspapers, that was not front-page news (though six weeks later
a journalist from the leading newspaper Haaretz did go and visit the girl's
family, which was more than anyone from the army had done). Nor are the
endless humiliations to which Arab families are subjected, such as being
pulled out of their houses and forced at gunpoint to erase graffiti sprayed
(by unidentified people with whom they may have no connection) on the
outside walls.
The 'sealing-off' applies to the West Bank, as well as Gaza, but not of
course to East Jerusalem which was declared an inalienable part of Israel
after its conquest in 1967, and which Israel is determined to keep outside
the scope of the proposed 'self-governing authority'. The closure is thus
highly disruptive of social, economic and cultural life on the West Bank,
for which Jerusalem is the natural centre. Besides making it impossible for
West Bank residents to work or attend meetings in Jerusalem itself, it all
but cuts off the north and south halves of the West Bank from each other: to
reach Ramallah, normally half an hour away, a resident of Bethlehem now has
to take a dirt road right down to the Dead Sea, along the Jordan valley to
Jericho, and then back up again.
Though introduced as a short-term security measure, almost a panic reaction
to the deaths of Israelis, the closure has been extended for a second month
and is now clearly intended to become the new normality. Lists of people
exempted from it are being drawn up, and there is talk of upgrading the dirt
road.
All in all, life is not too pleasant. Does that contradict the 'good news'
from Washington? Perhaps not. Insecurity, which drove Israelis to occupy the
territories in the first place, is now driving them to seek disengagement,
at least from the Arab-inhabited areas, at almost any price. And the
prospect of relief from day-to-day harassment may induce the Palestinians to
accept, as an interim solution, even an agreement that gives them only
limited autonomy on only a small part of their land.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Letter: NHS trust managers constrained from above
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms SUSANNE BRIERLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Unfortunately the National Health Service's former personnel director,
Eric Caines, is all too correct when he says the opportunities for NHS
trusts to break free from centralised pay and personnel policies are at risk
('No way to run a health service', April 27).
It is unfair, however, to lay so much blame on trust managers, most of whom
have been tightly constrained, not only by the political aspects he
describes, but also by revenue limitations and the huge agenda for
organisational and managerial change they have been implementing.
Many human resource managers have quietly progressed with incremental change
while acquiring the new skills needed for local pay bargaining and
establishing new relationships with staff unions. Most have introduced new
personnel policies and trust employment contracts, restricted in use by the
protection of staff on national conditions under the transfer arrangements.
Initial dreams of attracting staff off the Whitley council system and
simplifying pay structures proved, with few exceptions, not to be viable due
to the sheer cost on the paybill, especially in the larger multifunctional
units, and, latterly, the 1.5 per cent pay limit. Recession deferred the
demographic black hole, while emphasis on local needs logically means
differing priorities on limited resources.
As Caines points out, progress has generally been far short of expectations
 -empty promises and changeable political agenda provide sandy foundations.
Simply telling trusts to get rid of Whitley shows an abdication rather than
delegation of issues.
Failure to announce the phasing out of national negotiating machinery and
the continued central impositions have conflicted with promises of devolved
management. Most trusts want the opportunity to devise local arrangements
but lack certainty of agenda and backing by top management and politicians.
Accountability to the public is vital, but responsibility appears to have
been devolved more readily than the authority to manage.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Letter: Japanese taxation of whisky and shochu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J. BOURLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Japan's whisky and shochu taxation as discussed by your correspondent
Kojiro Shiojiri (April 20) and by Ronald Brown and Tim Jackson (April 27)
raises more questions than answers.
Why should Japan be held to account for an EC regulation. which prevents
distillers here from marketing whisky with less than 40 per cent alcohol -
when most drinkers add water to reduce their drink to around 20 per cent
anyway? And why don't European distillers produce shochu, the contents of
which are no secret, if they want to do business in Japan?
Surely the Japanese are entitled to point out that if importers produce
whisky of 20 per cent proof and shochu alongside other white spirits, both
of which the Japanese consumer clearly demands, then the tax position will
no longer be an issue.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Letter: Mature approach of EBRD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID M HOWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Recent attacks on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
have some justification and the bank's president, Jacques Attali, has been
unwise in certain internal spending policies. These criticisms should not
obscure, however, the bank's achievements and the spade-work done for the
future in terms of development and merchant banking.
While those of us who deal with the EBRD feel a degree of frustration at the
procedural requirements and delays, the bank's own systems will doubtless be
refined and many of the problems are not of its making.
They arise, rather, from the varying political and economic characteristics
of the countries of eastern and central Europe and from the need for
strategic overviews prior to investment. The bank has a responsibility to
consider not only shorter-term financial criteria but the longer-term
environmental and strategic development of the regions.
Such policies can only be developed on a step-by-step basis. I and my
colleagues recognise that the bank can have no magic wand in securing an
'open cheque book' for potential investments but we believe this mature
approach will achieve a long-term future for growth.
The EBRD should be congratulated on the manner in which it provides
information and briefings to interested parties and on providing a high
level of informative documentation to those attending the annual meeting.
Before the recent spate of criticism, M. Attali had proved to be a visionary
in having established the EBRD with a high-profile and well-developed
structure for future operations, over a short period. In due course a more
traditional banker will no doubt become the bank's president, but this
contribution should not be overlooked.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Arts: Perception is the name of the game - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GRADE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About two years ago at the Edinburgh Festival, Channel 4 was under its
annual, critical attack for abandoning its remit to provide innovative and
minority interest programmes. After a lively session in which I was called
on to defend our programming policy, I overheard two producers discussing
the issue. 'The trouble is,' said one, 'you can't argue with Grade because
all he does is quote programmes at you.'
As with politics and business, the arts and sport, perception is everything
and television is no exception. An idea, usually negative, gains currency
and there is no way to shift that perception. All you can do is ride the
waves of criticism and hope the 'perceptionists' move on to find a new
target. Not even Sir Tim Bell and the expensive spin doctors can turn the
tide of generalisation and prejudice once it starts to roll.
Evidence is irrelevant. Facts are selected to suit the general perception
and whenever television is discussed, convenient examples are easy to come
by. Each of the four terrestrial channels transmits an incredible range of
good, bad and indifferent programmes each week. By a process of careful
selection, anyone can make a case for or against any of the TV channels.
Let me demonstrate: it could be argued that BBC 2 is no longer the cultural
force that it was. It is failing to maintain its own standards of
originality and innovation. It is a channel of endless snooker, tired
American reruns (MASH and Star Trek); safe old formats (Top Gear, Dr. Who
and Gardeners' World); and a string of talent and ideas pinched from Channel
4 (Harry Enfield, Clive James, Ben Elton, Ruby Wax, Vic Reeves, archive
nights and Valentine's Day seasons, etc etc).
This judgment of BBC 2 is, of course, a travesty - just a highly distorted
perception.
A few weeks ago Christopher Dunkley used this column to write an open letter
to Michael Jackson, the new Controller of BBC 2. Dunkley made it clear that
he regards BBC 2 as the best and the most precious of all our channels. It
was an encomium about the channel and a thinly veiled warning to Jackson not
to muck it up.
Fair enough. There is nothing so scarce in the media these days as praise
(ask Martyn Lewis). Dunkley cares about BBC 2 and is not afraid to use his
regular Wednesday column to say so. He is a critic whose opinion counts for
something after all these years of box watching for the Financial Times. I,
too, value BBC 2, both as a licence payer and a competitor.
But, but, but . . . his perception of BBC 2's rival, Channel 4, was, well,
simply perception and every bit as false as my cheap characterisation of BBC
2 earlier. Dunkley wrote:
'Now, as one of the last gasps of full-blown Thatcherism, Channel 4 has been
driven into the market place and obliged to compete for its own slice of
advertising cake. As you might expect with Michael Grade in charge, it is
proving a pretty effective competitor and is regularly achieving an audience
share of around 12 per cent instead of the 9 to 10 per cent that it used to
get. Whatever the people at Channel 4 may bravely proclaim about sticking to
the famous 'remit' to 'be different' and 'cater' for 'minorities', I think
we must expect that Channel 4, at least in peak viewing time, will continue
to look more and more like any other conventional commercial channel, with
game shows (The Crystal Maze); soap opera (Brookside); and the largest
proportion of American imports in British terrestrial television (The Wonder
Years, Mork and Mindy, The Golden Girls, and soon The Golden Palace).'
Well, I have read some tosh in my time but this really is the 'tosh-est'. Mr
Dunkley has a nasty case of 'perception-itis'.
Facts first: Crystal Maze is in its fourth year and Brookside is in its
eleventh, hardly evidence of a sudden shift of policy in response to our new
competitive status. Of the American imports he cites, neither Mork and Mindy
nor Wonder Years plays in peak time, which he says is where the danger lies.
He makes no mention of Cheers and Roseanne, two of the freshest comedy shows
available anywhere, more witty and consistently funny than anything to be
found on British television. Why should we apologise for spotting them and
bringing them to Britain? The best American comedies have graced the channel
from the beginning.
And so to ratings - he cites Channel 4's current surge in popularity as
evidence of a decline in standards. But what is BBC 2's audience share? In
the last full calendar year (the only meaningful measure) Channel 4 and BBC
2 were neck and neck at just over 10 per cent. So Channel 4 has, after 10
years, caught up with BBC 2 (and we have abandoned snooker). In Mr Dunkley's
world, why is it OK for BBC 2 to have ten per cent, but not Channel 4?
Dunkley's 'law' suggests that we should not have taken on the recent season
of peak time documentaries, drama and features about the homeless because it
contributed to a record week of ratings for the Channel. I might understand
his concern if Channel 4's share had leapt past BBC 2 to, say, 20 per cent.
Another flaw in his perception, or rather lack of it, is his belief that in
peak time Channel 4 will have to become like the other main commercial
channels. But, Mr Dunkley, if our ratings are growing (which they have been
for two years) why on earth would we want to change?
It would be commercial suicide for Channel 4 to try to copy the other big
channels. We would get crushed. Our commercial success depends on offering
both the audience and advertisers something different. This is the policy of
the Board of Channel 4 and on the evidence of the first few months of
competitive selling, it is working a treat.
And so, without apology, to programmes. Here are some facts about the all
important peak time: we run 50 minutes of the nightly Channel 4 News, and
factual programmes dominate between 8.00 and 10.00pm; we run arts programmes
(Without Walls and Rear Window); we run current affairs (Dispatches, Black
Bag, A Week in Politics, The World This Week, etc); we run documentaries
(Cutting Edge, Short Stories, True Stories, Critical Eye, Secret History,
etc, etc); we run our own entertainment (Drop The Dead Donkey, Whose Line Is
It Anyway, Clive Anderson Talks Back, Paul Merton, etc, etc); we run
education (Pulse, Eat Your Greens and Grow Your Greens, Our Back Yard, etc);
we run drama (GBH, Big Battalions, Camomile Lawn, Lipstick On Your Collar -
plus short films by new writers and Film On Four, without which there would
he even less of a British film industry). Not to mention special seasons,
like the recent Gimme Shelter on the homeless - which, of course, Mr Dunkley
did not. Religion, British animation, opinions, foreign films, operas old
and new - I could go on and on. I do go on and on, but then programmes are
the only worthwhile evidence.
In the calendar year 1992, Channel 4's top 20 programmes included only three
American comedies (at numbers 13, 16 and 17). The top five programmes were
three home produced documentaries, a drama series and an ITV repeat. So,
there goes the 'Channel 4 is all quiz games and imports' theory.
Oscars and Emmies from the US, BAFTA awards and pots galore from all over
the world count for nothing. Mr Dunkley chose to ignore all the above
evidence. It just did not meet his perception and to him perceiving is
believing. He is, nevertheless, a splendid commentator on the affairs of
British television. But that is just my perception.
Christopher Dunkley is on holiday. Michael Grade is chief executive of
Channel 4

FT  05 MAY 93 / Arts: AIDS Quilt Songbook in San Francisco - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIMOTHY PFAFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the American baritone William Parker found his career, as well as his
body, ravaged by the Aids virus, he again turned to song and conceived the
idea for The AIDS Quilt Songbook. He commissioned from leading composers and
poets a still-growing collection of songs that, like the panels in the Names
Project quilt, remember individuals who have died of Aids.
Like the quilt's panels, the Songbook songs are performed in whatever
configuration best suits an occasion. The 16 songs recently performed during
the San Francisco Symphony's 'Wet Ink' new-music festival turned out to be,
among other things, a memorial for Parker himself, who died in New York on
March 29 at the age of
49.
The musically exemplary performances by the baritones Kurt Ollmann, David
Evitts, and Andrew Solomon-Glover were unified by the deeply sympathetic
piano playing of William Huckaby, an associate of the project from its
inception. The songs (soon to be published by Boosey and Hawkes) ranged from
the sweetly elegiac (Ned Rorem's 'A Dream of Nightingales') to the ragingly
defiant (Donald Wheelock's 'Fury'). While each poem and its setting captured
an aspect of grief, some inevitably left longer echoes in memory.
Solomon-Glover intoned John Harbison's 'The Flute of Interior Time' in a
rapt hush. Ollmann, who captured the specific consolation in Thom Gunn's
'The Reassurance' (set by Donald St. Pierre), carefully traced the thread of
a Chinese proverb embedded in the Ron Schreiber text of Carl Byron's 'the
birds of sorrow.' Evitts masterfully delineated the desultory undertow in
William Bolcom's bluesy 'Vaslav's Song' and kept listeners hanging on the
heartbreaking narrative of Lee Hoiby's 'Investiture at Cecconi's'
Throughout, the powerful texts told, even across difficult musical idioms.
Sad lines, like 'Paul Jacobs is playing Busoni on the radio' (from Chris De
Blasio's 'An Elegy to Paul Jacobs') were wrenching. Yet the most memorable
words were the hard ones, like the rapier word-play of poet Charles Barber's
'Death be nimble - life was quick' in St Pierre's 'Fairy Book Lines.' Even a
San Francisco concert audience was pommelled by poet Melvin Dixon's tough
talk - 'Night sweats. Dry cough/Loose stools. Weight loss.' rendered with
uncomprom-
ising force by Evitts.
The music was deeply personal. If some of it seemed less than external, it
bears remembering that no one wanted to have to write this music, and that
the participants would like nothing more than for this music to become
unnecessary and obsolete.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Arts: Magic realism in 'The House of the Spirits' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Latin America has a pace of its own. The stage premier of Isabel Allende's
The House of The Spirits runs for eight hours, about as long as it takes to
read the original book she wrote in 1982. The play, Allende's own
adaptation, is now at the Shaw Theatre. It makes an absorbing, exhausting
spectacle.
The style is magic realism, a blend of the real and the imaginary which
evolves naturally from a multi-cultural Latin America. The European
exponents are Gunter Grass and Milan Kundera. But the Colombian writer
Garcia Marquez was the first populist in the genre with Cien Anos de Solidad
(1967). What makes the style inimical to theatre, a sequential art form, is
that it conflates past, present and future. To read Allende, Marquez or the
lesser known magical realists Miguel Asturias or Alejo Carpentier for plot
would be to miss the point. In Allende, everything happens all the time, it
is a form of life.
The dynastic story of The House of The Spirits starts in Chile, 1910 and
finishes after the September 1973 coup, the assassination of President
Allende (Isabel's uncle) and the establishment of the Pinochet regime. There
are autobiographical details from Allende's time as a journalist in Chile
and then Venezuela, as well as family memoirs and folklore brought to bear
on current events.
The play charts the fortunes of Clara and Esteban, the one a luminous
clairvoyant and the other - like most of the men here - a feckless, violent
and troubled soul. They live in Santiago and on a hacienda in the Andes,
where the campesinos emerge from serfdom to political power in the 1970s. As
each aspect of family lore fashions itself, memories harden into facts,
whims into obsessions and visions into realities. 'Life is long,' says
Clara, 'and full of unexpected turns.'
But the plot is not entirely at the mercy of serendipity. The laws of
causation and prediction become the life of the family.
Out on the hacienda, advice takes root and grows into the future: 'Land is
something one should never sell, it's what is left when everything else is
gone' says Esteban, 'But land is a romantic notion' replies his mother. She
is right, he loses it.
As the story rolls down the generations, finishing with Alba, the
granddaughter of Clara and Esteban, it gathers momentum and amplitude; what
seemed a distraction in the first part of the play emerges as a significant
detail in the second: a mothy animal skin, a severed head, a caddy of
hoarded cash. For each generation, love is a visceral shudder and death a
whispered secret. Every family rite involves extensive nudity on stage. The
family's powers of imagination and intuition pass through the women, 'the
stoical practical women of our country', a sorority of tough-minded
individuals who control the men. Conrad was right, god for men and religion
for women.
There are wonderful comic moments: the whore looking to modernise her
brothel, 'we ought to bring in civil servants who have nothing to do during
the day' or the maid trying to scare the young Clara - silent for ten years
 -into speech. Director Michael Batz amalgamates the action well, with
haunting songs (by the Chilenos Violetta Parra and the murdered Victor Jara)
beautifully sung by Claudia Figueroa and Mauricio Venegas.
The cast of 18, from eleven different countries, speaks a mixture of English
and robust South American Spanish without the old-world sibilants. The
principals, Josephine Welcome (Clara), Alkis Kritikos (Esteban), Carmen
Gomez (Ferula, Esteban's sister) and Christina Clark (Alba) keep the passion
high and the life intense. Try to see both parts in one day (Saturday or
Sunday). Characters reappear like old friends.
If the second half of the first part and the middle of the second are still
slack dramatically, perhaps the answer is simply a different view of what
theatre does. 'It may be true' says one character, 'that everything happens
simultaneously.'
The Shaw Theatre until 23 May: Thursdays, part I; Fridays, part II;
Saturdays and Sundays, parts I &amp; II. (071-388-1394)

FT  05 MAY 93 / Arts: More opera at Covent Garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jeremy Isaacs, general director at Covent Garden, yesterday proclaimed the
Royal Opera House to be in 'goodish shape'. Despite making a surplus in
1992-93, tight financial constraints continue and are reflected in the
1993-94 season. For the Royal Ballet there are no new full length
productions at Covent Garden; the 'new' Sleeping Beauty is to be premiered
during the US tour. For the Royal Opera there are seven new productions but
three are co-productions with other opera houses.
The incoming opera director Nicholas Payne signposted four initiatives which
are reflected in the 1993-94 season. The Wagner repertory will be
revitalised; in October there is a new production of Der Meistersinger, and
a new Ring is planned from 1994. A Verdi Festival starts in 1995, with the
aim of performing all his operas by 2002. In the meantime a fresh Aida, not
seen at Covent Garden for a decade, opens in June 1994.
As ever there is a desire to perform more British works, with revivals of
Birtwistle's Gawaine and of Britten's Gloriana (in a guest performance by
Opera North) and to broaden the repertoire with little known works. In
1993-94 there will be new productions of Massenet's Cherubin; of Giordano's
Fedora (produced in association with La Scala, Milan); and Rossini's Mose in
Egitto (first seen in Bologna). The other new productions are Scottish
Opera's recent Die Zauberflote and Janacek's Katya Kabanova, which will be
directed by Trevor Nunn.
In its bid to pay off its deficit so that the government will be better
inclined to give Covent Garden the money needed to rebuild its theatre, the
Royal Opera House has plenty of popular classics in its programme, including
17 performances of Carmen and ten of Madama Butterfly. There will also be
much more opera (which produces a bigger box office) than dance.
Jeremy Isaacs is keen to popularise opera and is asking sponsors to help
Covent Garden by subsidising seat prices as well as sponsoring productions.
Four Saturday night performances will be subsidised in this way with over
1000 seats priced at under Pounds 12 The aim is ten such performances a
year.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Arts: Bernice Bobs her Hair
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scott Fitzgerald (1896-1940), the poet laureate of the party, knew that big
events were always more intimate than small soirees. His writing, like his
life, thrived on party scenes. Fitzgerald could never distinguish between
naivety and social climbing, so his stories had in-built innocence and
experience. Both are on show in his short story, Bernice Bobs Her Hair,
written in the spring of 1920. Now it has been made into a charming, light
musical at The Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond.
Bernice is all about coiffure. As one character says, 'This might sound
unfair but/ It's only a hair cut.' It is Fitzgerald's jazz age version of
the Berenice (c. 250 BC) who sacrificed her hair to Venus for the safe
return of her husband from the wars; Catullus wrote about it, and Ptolemy
III named a star 'Berenice's Curls'. Fitzgerald added elements of Samson and
The Rape of The Lock and saw the bobbing of Bernice as a rite of passage.
It is a story of East and West after all, of rich carelessness and poor
credulity. Country girl Bernice visits her rich society cousin Marjorie, who
first ridicules her gaucheries, then promises to make her into a society
vamp. So Bernice throws off her floral prints, climbs into slinky red, and
promises to cut off her hair. She does. Then she is doubly mocked, and
leaves town in shame, stopping to snip Marjorie's blonde tresses en route to
the station.
This makes thin matter for a musical. But composer Matthew Miller and
Lyricist John Gardyne take the Sondheim way out: a couple of good strong
numbers which resurface, modulated and intercut, throughout the show. They
succeed in making the songs constitute the action. Albeit short on jazz, the
evening amounts to a public party, with a cast of black-tied
cocktail-dressed young worrying about social niceties and growing old: 'If
you think you've troubles aplenty, Things could be worse, you could be
twenty.' The best number, apart from the opening chorus, 'Nights Like This'
is a love lament by Warren, a boy falling in love with Bernice. As he sings,
'She's not that kind of girl' he realises she is his kind of girl,
persuading himself into love while singing his way out of it.
The performances are steady, with highlights from Abigail Lee (Bernice),
Emma Parish (Marjorie) and Hugh Lee (Warren). The poor lighting diluted the
show's intimacy and energy; it should have been more focused.
The Orange Tree, Richmond (081-940-3633) until 29 May

Dispatches (C4, 9.00) presents fresh and important evidence that the
government knowingly permitted British businessmen to sell arms to Iraq, and
then sold them down the river. Paul Grecian and his fellow accused were
arrested in October 1990 and were found guilty last year of breaking the
arms embargo. Their unsuccessful defence, that the government knew of and
abetted their activities, was the same which subsequently got the Matrix
Churchill defendants off. Grecian relates how his discoveries about Saddam's
supergun led to his becoming an unpaid informer for M15 and M16. Open Space:
The Price of Fish (BBC 1, 7.40) gives a mouthpiece to the fishermen of
Brixham and Grimsby and their grievances against the EC quota system. Living

namely the position of women in Islam. Pigs are enthusiastic omnivores. So

FT  05 MAY 93 / Management: How do you rate on the common sense scale? / A
look at this elusive quality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Einstein defined common sense as the collection of prejudices people have
accrued by the age of 18, while Victor Hugo maintained common sense was
acquired in spite of, rather than because of, education.
Common sense, by definition, is supposed to be the most widely distributed
quality in the world and nearly everybody believes they have a good measure
of it. Many selectors look for, and all managers are supposed to have,
common sense. But what is common sense in the manager's world? And if
management is common sense, why bother to teach it?
The so-called 'discipline' of management science often has low status in
business schools, partly because the hard men of figures despise the soft
waffle of organisational behaviour.
Management science is thought to be a trivial, expensive and pointless
exercise in describing or proving what we already know. All findings are
intuitive, unsurprising and uninformative; worse it is packed with esoteric
jargon which obfuscates common sense in the pretence of clarifying it.
But there are serious problems with the common sense argument. First, common
sense is frequently contradictory. 'Clothes make the man' is at odds with
'You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear'. 'Out-of-sight,
out-of-mind' and 'Absence makes the heart grow fonder' also seem
contradictory. Although it is possible that both are true under different
circumstances, common sense does not tell you which.
Second, if all management is common sense, nothing can be the result of
faulty reasoning. Research in the social sciences is full of such examples
and it would not be surprising if some aspects of management science were
the same; that is, the opposite of common sense.
It could be argued that current management knowledge is absorbed from
management science as it is frequently popularised in newspapers and
magazines. Thus, ironically, common sense could be the result of the ideas
of management science being commented on in the popular press. A frequently
discussed finding from research cannot remain non-obvious to managers, any
more than a joke can remain funny to people who hear it again and again.
If all management is common sense and most people supposedly have this
curious trait, why do they disagree on issues, processes and procedures?
When managers try to specify the 'competencies' essential for high-flyers in
a company, many are tempted to include common sense, despite the fact that
it is almost impossible to define, measure and select. It may indeed be like
the search for the Holy Grail - long-standing, complicated and unsuccessful.
But why not test yourself? Are the following statements true or false? Mark
them accordingly and see how you rate on the common sense factor.
1. If you pay someone for doing something they enjoy, they will come to like
this task even more. T/F
2. Most people prefer challenging jobs with a great deal of freedom and
autonomy. T/F
3. Most people are more concerned with the size of their own salary than
with the salary of others. T/F
4. In most case, workers act in ways that are consistent with their
attitudes. T/F
5. In bargaining with others, it is usually best to start with a moderate
offer - near to the one you desire. T/F
6. In most cases leaders should stick to their decisions once they have made
them, even if it appears they are wrong. T/F
7. When people work together in groups and know their individual
contributions cannot be observed, each tend to put in less effort than when
they work on the same task alone. T/F
8. Even skilled interviewers are sometimes unable to avoid being influenced
in their judgment by factors other than an applicant's qualifications. T/F
9. Most managers are highly democratic in the way that they supervise their
people. T/F
10. Most people who work for the government are low risk takers. T/F
11. The best way to stop a malicious rumour at work is to present covering

FT  05 MAY 93 / Management: A measure of success - Companies are
enthusiastically embracing the concept of benchmarking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What did South-West Airlines of the US learn from studying pit crew
performance at the Indy 500? And why did the Granite Rock company look to
automated teller machines (ATMs) for a model to improve their gravel loading
techniques? The clue to both answers is benchmarking, a strategic management
tool which is currently one of the hottest-selling management consultancy
services in Europe and North America.
Best defined as the continuous measuring of a company's products, services,
processes and practices against those of its most successful competitors, or
against companies recognised as industry leaders, benchmarking has been
around for 15 years. But global competition and the tough markets of the
1990s have sparked a new interest in how it can help companies achieve
superior performance.
Benchmarking is increasingly found alongside total quality management and
business process re-engineering - two other 'big ideas' being promoted as
the key to greater efficiency - and is being widely applied in the public
sector as part of the UK government's market-testing programme.
A recent survey of the top 1,000 UK companies by Coopers and Lybrand and the
Confederation of British Industry found that more than two thirds of the 105
respondents from the manufacturing, service and other sectors claimed to
practise benchmarking and that 82 per cent of those who do believed it had
been successful. (Eighty per cent of Fortune 500 companies 'benchmark' in
one form or another.) Sixty eight per cent said they were planning to
increase investment in benchmarking in the next five years.
The challenge for today's benchmarking evangelists is that the idea has
sometimes promised more in the past than it could deliver: companies which
enthusiastically embraced the concept in recent years have too often been
disappointed by the results. Consultants therefore tend to stress the depth
of the commitment required and the importance of internal preparations
before benchmarking begins.
In a crude way Walter Chrysler, the US car maker, was benchmarking when he
tore apart a new Oldsmobile model to determine what went into it, how much
it cost and how it was made.
But the birth of benchmarking as understood today is generally credited to
Xerox, which by the 1980s was using it to confront and overcome the Far
Eastern challenge to its dominance in the worldwide copier market. Other big
US corporations such as Boeing and Motorola were quick to implement many of
the same techniques. Xerox was among the first to appreciate that
benchmarking need not be restricted to manufacturing - nor indeed to direct
competitors.
It is only recently, though, that the emphasis has moved away from
preoccupation with performance measures to finding out what gives leading
companies their competitive edge. 'In our opinion the subject has been
dominated by the search for benchmarks such that 90 per cent of effort has
been spent on the creation and analysis of metrics, and 10 per cent on
change,' observes Victor Luck, head of commerce and industry consulting
services at Coopers. 'It should be the other way round.'
As with all fashionable management techniques, peer pressure and the fear of
missing out may have something to do with it. Indications from the market
place, though, are that this is not a passing fad.
Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm, for example, has already invested an
estimated Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.4m) of cash and partners' time in its
proprietary and centralised Global Best Practices Knowledge Base. The
information - a resource for Andersen's people to use in helping clients
rather than a service to be shared externally - is being compiled from
external benchmarking studies, from Andersen's surveys (such as cost
management in the automotive industry and meter reading in the utilities
sector) and from partners' insights.
Between 300-400 partners and managers are involved in compiling the
database, which so far has benchmarking information on 18 detailed business
processes, ranging from customer satisfaction and processing customer orders
to obtaining materials and supplies.
Most experts agree that while companies within the same group can be a
useful starting point - and competitors are also an inevitable focus -
benchmarking should not be limited to like organisations. As Xerox
discovered, non-competitors may be more willing to share information on a
quid pro quo basis. Moreover, the most relevant information is often not the
actual numbers but the qualitative information about how things are done and
in what order.
The insights which South-West gained by studying pit crews on the Indy 500
circuit, helped the airline reduce the turnround time of its aircraft (from
arrival at the gate to 'push back' for the next flight) from 30 minutes to
15 minutes. Granite Rock decided its loading process was a similar challenge
to that faced by the banking industry - involving accurate accounting and a
need for speed and convenience for the user. Granite Rock drivers now use
ATM-like cards and the process is simpler, faster and more reliable.
Benchmarking, however, has its limitations. Used solely to emulate rather
than beat competitors, the advantages may be short lived. It can be
difficult to obtain relevant details about competitors and doing so can be
costly in time and money.
It remains to be seen how deeply benchmarking becomes ingrained into western
management thinking. After all, however much its disciples say benchmarking
is about sharing and co-operation it may smack of imitation or even
industrial espionage to others. That said, the likelihood is that
benchmarking will leave something of lasting value even after the current
enthusiasm has waned.
Examples of benchmarking practice will appear on this page shortly.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Jobs: Prime victims of the recessional axe - While companies
are certainly de-layering, there's little hard evidence of empowerment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'HOPE springs eternal in the human breast,' quoth Alexander Pope. And in the
case of Susan Mantell of Manchester at least, there is no doubt that he was
right.
Ms Mantell declares herself fed up with the Jobs column's 'undue pessimism'
in its writings on the Laws of Organisational Stupidity. Her charge is not
against the laws themselves, which denote certain patterns of lunatic events
that regularly bedevil all types of organisations everywhere.
What miffs her is my claim that, while some organisations occasionally
succeed in breaking the patterns, managements in general have failed to
counter such idiocies. Not so], she says, and cites an example she insists
is now being widely eradicated.
The point she picks on is an explanation often mooted for the workings of
the best known of the laws, Parkinson's First, stating: Work expands to fill
the time available. The explanation is that the said phenomenon is rooted in
the hunger for personal power, which psychological tests have shown to be
typically pronounced in people who become managers.
A time-honoured way to gain power in organisations is by empire-building,
acquiring more and more subordinates. When there's not enough productive
work for them to do, as is apt to be the case, they justify their position
by creating unnecessary tasks for one another.
Moreover such of them as lust for power also strive to acquire underlings
for themselves. Hence each rank of management tends to form another rank
below it, continually inserting further and successively less productive
layers of supervision between the top decision-makers and the shop-floor
where the work of serving the customer actually gets done.
Now Susan Mantell does not deny that empire-building has been rife in the
past. But she does claim that it is being reversed wholesale by the
conjunction of two trendily named processes. One is 'de-layering', throwing
out entire layers of management between the top bosses and the shop-floor.
The other is 'em-powering' in which the power formerly held by the scrapped
middle ranks is handed to the folk directly making, selling and delivering
the product.
Is the Jobs column too senile to have noticed same, she asks.
Well, I've certainly observed the de-layering element. But it would be wrong
to claim that the ranks so eliminated have in every case been those in the
middle.
A counter-example is to hand in Britain's local authorities. As revenues
have been squeezed, many have just cut the bottom layer, hiving off services
they once provided, and keeping the bureaucratic superstructure.
That would not have surprised the law's originator, Professor Northcote
Parkinson. After all, he pointed out that officials will find ways to keep
increasingly occupied even if there is no necessary work to do.
For instance, although some authorities have tried to prune the middle by
encouraging people to leave voluntarily, they have thereby probably invoked
the first of the two laws of organisational stupidity governing payroll
cuts. Called Evans's Ejector, it states: After any voluntary redundancy
exercise, the number of staff needed to achieve a given output will be
larger than before. And the reduction of direct links with the consumer has
no doubt reinforced another law, Schein's Syndrome: Internal politics
flourish at the customer's expense as exposure to the market decreases.
True, in companies which are market-dependent the de-layering has been
largely in the middle, and the reverse of voluntary. Even so, while avoiding
the effects of the Ejector, it has probably invoked the second law governing
staff cuts. But before I state it, let's look at the sort of people most
likely to have been in the scrapped middle-ranks, with the aid of the chart
below.
Borrowed from the American psychologist Albert Bernstein's book Neanderthals
at Work (Wiley, Pounds 12.95), it summarises the characteristics of three
readily recognisable types of worker.
As may be seen, it suggests that middle management is mainly the province of
Believers. And the likelihood that it is they who have mostly gone in the
de-layering is plain from the second law on staff-cuts, Carew's Axe: In any
compulsory redundancy exercise, meekness will be punished before
uselessness.
If so, the economies in head-counts will not necessarily work to the
corporate benefit. For the Rebels below and the Competitors on top will no
longer have their individual proclivities moderated by such a strong
co-ordinating force of Believers who, as Dr Bernstein says, 'do - and take
pride in doing - the hundred million tasks that have to be done every day'.
True, the Believers can't all have been thrown out, for as he also says:
'the corporate world would collapse without them.' So the cuts in their
numbers might be counteracted if companies were really accompanying the
de-layering, as Ms Mantell believes, by empowering the Believers they have
left.
Alas I do not see much chance of that happening as long as company promotion
systems go on awarding the highest posts mostly to Competitors. After all,
empowerment requires bosses from the boardroom downwards to cede
decision-making authority to their subordinate teams.
That conflicts with the very nature of Competitors who see a good
team-worker as someone who does precisely as they say. It is solely the
Believers who are given to devolving authority. So little real empowerment
would seem likely until companies start preferring them for the top jobs.
But I can see no hard evidence that such is taking place. The only
independent studies of the topic I know of - by Lynda Gratton of London
Business School - show that even groups claiming to be dedicated devolvers
still systematically promote Competitors to the commanding heights.
Accordingly, since they are also the prime empire-builders, I cannot share
Ms Mantell's faith. Far from being accompanied by empowerment, the
de-layering will most probably just be followed by re-layering once the
pressure on costs eases again.
                          *      *      *
BERNSTEIN'S THREE BASIC TYPES OF WORKER
Rebels: Technically expert and often creatively hard work is enough to bring
its just reward, intelligent, they're indispensable in crises. they are
blind to the need to play politics, so Highly motivated to do things they
like, but seldom rise beyond middle management. despise routine duties such
as paperwork. They therefore rarely rise above junior rank.
Believers: Work unstintingly and well without fuss even at tasks they
dislike, and their straight-dealing makes them highly motivating managers to
work for.  But in their faith that hard work is enough to bring its just
reward, they are blind to the need to play politics, so seldom rise beyond
middle management.
Competitors:  Dedicated to winning personally. They're quick to spot how the
company system Believers: Work unstintingly and well without really works as
distinct from how it's officially fuss even at tasks they dislike, and their
supposed to, and manipulate it to serve their straight-dealing makes them
highly motivating own ambitions regardless of the best interests managers to
work for. But in their faith that of the company.  Most likely to rise to
the top.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Business and the Environment: Designer labels for buildings
 -A voluntary standard is giving developers the chance to mark their
environmental progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trevor Silver, director of Doxford International business park in
Sunderland, northeast England, would have liked a windmill to power the
landscaped water features but a payback of 15 years or more was a
non-starter with the accountants.
The shrubs and trees, flourishing in landscaped beds around the first phase
of offices, will provide a pleasing green backdrop, but the police would
have preferred more security-conscious concreted surfaces with unimpeded
views.
The development lacks parking space for bicycles - an omission which cost
one credit on the Building Research Establishment's 'green' office rating -
but letting agents are far more interested in the number of car parking
spaces per square foot of office than in pedal power.
While frequently lauded as a good thing, environmental ideals are not always
easy to reconcile with harsher economic and social reality, especially in a
recession.
Compromise, as the first phase of the Pounds 125m business park illustrates,
is inescapable. But the Sunderland enterprise zone development, the first to
be assessed under the BRE's recently updated Environmental Assessment Method
for New Offices (Breeam), nevertheless suggests there are commercial as well
as ethical attractions in striving for improved environmental standards.
Silver says that Akeler Holdings, Doxford International's parent company,
noticed a couple of years ago that institutional investors were beginning to
ask for a 'green statement' for new developments. Nobody, however, seemed to
have much idea what that meant.
Akeler became convinced that protecting the environment was becoming
commercially, as well as morally, worthwhile. Environmental quality, it
decided, would be a valuable marketing tool in promoting its planned
Sunderland business park, both by attracting potential tenants and by
convincing them the space they leased would be ahead of, not behind, future
environmental legislation.
So the company set about finding a standard against which to measure its
aspiration that the Doxford development, sited on low-grade agricultural
land on the urban fringe, should result in net environmental gain. The
standard it used was an upgrade of the BRE's original office Breeam scheme
which, since its inception in July 1990, has attracted developers of 25 per
cent of all new office space in the UK, even though it is voluntary and
self-financing.
The updated Breeam, launched last January, has already attracted 15
applications for assessment of new schemes, mostly at design stage. BRE, an
executive agency of the Department of the Environment, is delighted at
striking a chord with developers.
'We certainly see with the update of the Breeam scheme we've moved forward
the boundaries of standards,' says Paul Bartlett, head of BRE's
Environmental Assessment and Futures section. A building's environmental
performance is not necessarily visible, he says. Breeam acts as a label.
The updated office scheme, covering global, local and indoor issues, offers
developments up to 42 credits for a standard list of features, assessed by
independent consultants licenced by BRE. An overall rating of fair, good,
very good or excellent is also awarded. Doxford business park's first phase
was rated 'very good'; two of its office blocks won 34 credits, the others
33.
Provision and use of buildings has a greater impact on the global
environment, says BRE, than almost any other human activity, excepting
population growth. For example, it estimates buildings now account for
around 15 per cent of UK CFC emissions, contributing to depletion of the
ozone layer, and half of carbon dioxide emissions, adding to the greenhouse
effect.
The Breeam scheme aims to raise awareness of buildings' impact on the
environment, to stimulate market demand for environment-friendly buildings,
to reduce the use of increasingly scarce resources and improve the quality
of buildings' indoor environment, hence the health of their occupants.
It tackles CO emissions, acid rain, ozone depletion, legionnaires' disease,
noise, water economy, hazardous materials, lighting, ventilation and thermal
comfort.
The European Network of Building Research Institutes, of which BRE is a
founder member, has decided to adopt Breeam as a basis for Enbreeam, a
Europe-wide grading, which will take into account national factors, such as
climate and construction techniques.
The Breeam assessment charge, paid by applicants, averages between Pounds
3,000-Pounds 5,000; the total cost of the environment-friendly features
which win credits ranges, says BRE, from 0 to 3 per cent of development
costs.
At Doxford's first phase, sold on to Property Enterprise Trust for Pounds
18m, Silver estimates the additional cost of environmental friendliness at
around Pounds 400,000. 'That isn't as frightening as it might sound out of
context,' he says.
Some features, such as highly efficient boilers, offer immediate savings
which will be attractive to tenants; quantifiable annual energy savings at
Doxford's first phase office blocks are estimated at Pounds 7,800.
However, striving for environmental quality may open up new areas of
responsibility for developers. Having decided he wanted a landscaped
environment - 'not Fort Knox' - in which the adjacent community would take
pride, Silver has been drawn into worthwhile, but time-consuming, school
project work. A dog-owner, he is nevertheless ambivalent about the
enthusiastic response to his landscaping from neighbourhood dog-walkers, but
sees it as a small price to pay for local goodwill.
Different versions of the Breeam scheme already cover domestic buildings and
superstores and a light industrial and warehouse category is being
developed.
More radically, environment secretary Michael Howard launched a new Breeam
for existing offices last week. 'It encourages the market to move in the
direction of improved environmental performance. It's a valuable tool in
harnessing market forces,' said Howard. In the property market of the 1990s,
'Breeamed' looks likely to become a familiar word.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Business and the Environment: A Greek tragedy in the making
 -Worldwide water / Supplies in Athens may dry up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VASSILEIOS Grivas, deputy director of the Athens water company, points to a
precipitous dip on a chart showing reservoir levels in central Greece. He
says: 'The decline in rainfall is so pronounced over the past six years that
we're outside all the statistical patterns. We have to assume the worst.'
The prospect that the city's water supply might dry up completely before the
end of 1993 is focusing Greek minds on water conservation in an unexpectedly
dramatic way.
From the early 1980s, the Mornos reservoir, 190km from Athens, covered
almost all the capital's water requirements, estimated at about 1m cu metres
daily. But a run of dry winters, together with rising consumption in
suburban districts and losses from an ageing distribution network, has
shrunk reserves to an all-time low.
Grivas says: 'It didn't help that people got wasteful, turning on the hose
to wash the terrace. Water prices stayed low and there was an illusion that
the Mornos was a boundless resource.'
At around 80 litres daily, per capita water use in Athens was still low by
comparison with northern European cities. However, since the water company
sounded the alarm in January, announcing sharp price hikes for large
domestic users, consumption has dropped by almost 30 per cent.
After another dry winter, Athens now survives on water from a drilling
programme that draws up to 400,000 cu metres daily from subterranean
aquifers. However, water quality has suffered, while there are fears that
pumping from aquifers, some underlying densely inhabited areas where
groundwater contains pollutants, could lead to contamination of drinking
water.
Contractors working on a Dr50bn (Pounds 149m) dam project to divert water
from the Evinos river, in central Greece, into the Mornos artificial lake
have been offered a bonus to complete the job ahead of time, but there is
little likelihood that it can be finished before 1996.
Tenders are already out for shipping water in tankers to Athens from
southern Greece later this year, using springs that are taxed in summer to
augment water supplies to islands overrun by tourists.
While the water crisis in Athens makes headlines, policymakers have ignored
the drain on resources from steadily increasing demand by farmers for
irrigation. Yet agriculture accounts for more than 70 per cent of water
consumption in Greece, compared with about 12 per cent for domestic use.
High EC support prices for crops needing irrigation, such as cotton and
maize, encouraged Greek growers to switch from traditional products.
Moreover, with politicians unwilling to risk losing votes by charging
farmers for water, irrigation costs were kept artificially low.
The result has been a steady drop in ground water levels, leading to
increasing salinisation in intensively cultivated areas such as the Thessaly
plain in eastern Greece.
'The situation is made worse because there's no co-ordinated policy on water
resources in the countryside. Each municipality is responsible for its own
drillings, so you may find several tapping independently into the same
aquifer, with potentially disastrous results,' says Vassilis Katsoupas of
the Worldwide Fund for Nature's Greece branch.
The official solution for Thessaly is a controversial project to divert up
to 30 per cent of the Acheloos river water flow from western to eastern
Greece.
However, opponents of the Dr83bn project, which also calls for the
construction of two dams and four hydro-electric power stations on Acheloos,
say the diversion will dry out wetlands around Messolonghi on the western
coast, a breeding ground for rare birds and a fish-farming centre.
'The issue is not to increase the water supply for agriculture, but to
encourage farmers to use less wasteful irrigation methods. With powerful
sprinklers, a high percentage of water is lost through evaporation,'
Katsoupas says.
If managing water resources is an emerging problem for mainland Greece, it
has long been recognised on the islands. Chronic water shortages are seen as
the leading constraint on raising the quality of tourist facilities.
With the population of smaller islands liable to quadruple at the height of
the tourist season, the choice for local authorities lies between investing
in a desalinisation plant, often a noisy eyesore in a small-scale
environment, or paying high prices to secure an adequate tanker supply.
Per capita water demand rises sharply from around 100 litres daily at a
moderate hotel to more than 600 litres daily at a luxury resort.
Large hotels are required to install treatment facilities for waste water,
which should create additional supplies for garden maintenance and other
uses. Yet hotels on the Greek islands often flout the regulations because it
still costs less to pay a high water bill than to keep treatment plants in
regular operation.
Beb Jeftic, chief marine scientist at the UN Environment Programme's
Mediterranean Action Plan co-ordinating unit, says: 'Even on islands, where
tourism has replaced farming, aquifers are often depleted and sea water
encroaches. The most important way of husbanding resources is to ensure that
every drop of waste water is treated by hotels and re-used.'

FT  05 MAY 93 / People: Poulson to move to Farnell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Howard Poulson, chief executive of Volex, the electrical and electronic
connection products group, has been appointed group chief executive at
Farnell Electronics, the Harrogate-based electronic components and equipment
manufacturer and distributor.
Poulson, aged 50, is expected to take up his new appointment before October.
He joined Volex in 1990 as managing director and chief executive and has
played an important role in revamping the group.
Having graduated in engineering and metallurgy from Imperial College,
London, he entered industry by joining Lucas in 1964 and was technical
director of Lucas Industrial Systems between 1981 and 1985. Before joining
Volex, he worked for Dobson Park Industries, where he was main board
director responsible for the industrial electronics division.
His appointment to Farnell is seen as a further indication that the group,
which once had a reputation for being a somewhat introverted business, is
now much more outward- looking and determined to continue its expansion.
Farnell has been looking for a group chief executive since Richard Hanwell
became chairman in June last year in succession to Ray Kidd. Hanwell's
arrival was quickly followed by the acrimonious departure of Eric Hall, the
previous chief executive of Farnell's manufacturing division.
Since then the new chairman has restructured Farnell's manufacturing
division, dividing it into three product sectors, each with its own managing
director and with Andrew Lamming as divisional chief executive.
Farnell also announced yesterday the promotion of Chris Emptage, 43, from
deputy to managing director of the UK-based Farnell Electronics Components
company, the largest and most profitable business in the group.
Allan Daniel, currently managing director of FEC, will now concentrate fully
on his role as chief executive of the coredistribution division.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Policymaking overhaul urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RADICAL overhaul of Whitehall policymaking to clarify the responsibilities
of civil servants and ministers is proposed in a paper today from the
European Policy Forum, the cross-party think tank.
Government departments should become policy agencies with titles describing
what they are supposed to achieve - a Crime Reduction Agency at the Home
Office, for example - suggests Professor Norman Lewis of the University of
Sheffield, the report's author.
Agencies should include ministers, external advisers and civil servants, he
says.
An independent body would also be created to review policy successes and
failures, to help Commons' cross-party departmental committees.
Prof Lewis adds: 'Ways would need to be found of associating civil servants
with the success or failure of the policies so their career prospects were
clearly affected.'
He also proposes a Monetary Policy Agency at the Treasury and a Family
Poverty Watch at the social security department.
The government's Next Steps programme for Whitehall agencies and the
Citizen's Charter go some way towards these goals, he argues. But he
believes a greater role has to be given to the legal system and that the
importance of policymaking - as opposed to service provision - is
underplayed.
Efforts to deliver public services centrally are misspent, he says. 'There
is neither adequate information nor expertise; responding to consumer
signals is sluggish and sometimes almost entirely absent.
'On the other hand, the need for clear-headed policies and strategies in the
new circumstances of domestic change within a global economy is becoming
increasingly obvious.'

FT  05 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: County council election issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE council tax is widely regarded as the 'dog which did not bark' in this
year's county council elections - but all parties agree that it would have
bulked much larger if it had not followed the poll tax, or community charge,
John Authers writes.
Conservatives have tried to make the tax an election issue, and claim a
degree of success. A spokesman said: 'We would argue quite strongly that the
council tax and the level of bills people have to pay is going to be
absolutely vital in the election.'
They argue that councils spend an average of Pounds 1,500 per household,
making a county council vote 'the biggest expenditure decision many people
are going to make'. The party has also tried to demonstrate that Labour
councils charge a higher level of tax.
However, the Tories still admit that it has not been the central issue on
the doorsteps, taking second place variously to education, community care,
and local issues. They are also deeply relieved that the tax is not as
controversial as its predecessor.
Labour believes the tax has not been important in most areas, but it has had
to work hard to rebut Conservative claims.
Its campaigners have relied on a survey by the Local Government Chronicle
magazine, which showed that average council tax payments in Labour councils
were Pounds 14 lower than in Conservative councils.
A Labour party spokesman said: 'The point we are making is that we are
actually a bit cheaper than the Conservatives, but we're certainly no more
expensive.'

FT  05 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government pressed over Bosnia
troops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINISTRY of Defence believes Britain's contribution to any United
Nations peacekeeping force in Bosnia could be met from existing UK troop
levels - in spite of concern from a senior army general and MPs' pleas for
defence cuts to be reviewed.
However, ministers are expected to push at the UN for a commitment to troops
from the participating countries being rotated accord-ing to a pre-agreed
timetable.
Adding to the pressure on the government, General Sir David Ramsbotham, the
Army's top personnel officer, said yesterday: 'I don't believe we can
support continuous deployment (in the former Yugoslavia) without seriously
overstretching our resources. . . We will have to cope but I frankly believe
we have to be very careful about committing that number of people.'
Mr John Major, the prime minister, last night said 'I'm sure we can cope
with any question that arises.' He was speaking after meeting Mr Edouard
Balladur, the French prime minister, in London.
Separately, Tory MPs, led by Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smith, chairman of the
party's backbench defence committee, are pushing for the role of reserve
troops to be enhanced if large numbers of British soldiers are sent to
Bosnia.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, believes a rotation scheme would
encourage other countries to take part in a UN operation, easing fears of
being sucked into an open-ended commitment.
Such a deal would also be easier for the government to sell to Tory MPs
nervous about any escalation in Britain's military involvement.
The weekend announcement by the US administration that it would contribute
troops to a UN operation enforcing an agreement to the peace plan of Mr
Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen has triggered speculation that Britain may be
asked to provide as many as 10,000 ground troops from a total army strength
of some 136,000.
The government refused yesterday to comment on numbers, saying decisions
would be not be made until Britain was asked to contribute.
However, a MoD official said a UK contribution to a ground force could be
met 'from existing resources'. About 2,500 UK soldiers are already serving
in Bosnia on humanitarian work and Downing Street expects the cost of any
additional peace-keeping to be funded by the UN.
Colleagues of Mr Rifkind pointed out that he has already responded to
changed circumstances by deciding in February to restore 3,000 army posts
and to cancel two regimental amalgamations, watering down the government's
'options for change' plan. Further reprieves are not envisaged, they said.
However, some MPs remain concerned that Options for Change's impact on
equipment and troop numbers will restrict Britain's military capability.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour highlights local authority
job losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 38,000 job losses have been announced in local government in the past
five months, Labour said yesterday as the local election campaign entered
its final stage.
Launching a Labour-commissioned study of local government job losses, Mr
Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, said local authorities in every
region of the country had been affected.
According to the report, conducted by the Centre for Local Economic
Strategies, a total of 6,000 job losses have been announced in Yorkshire and
Humberside, with 5,500 in the east Midlands and 5,400 in greater London.
More than 12,500 of the job losses are in county councils, which, the study
says, have 'borne the brunt' of council cuts along with metropolitan
authorities.
With voters in 47 county councils in England and Wales due to go to the
polls tomorrow, the Conservatives countered by saying that Tory policies
provided high-quality services in councils across the country at the lowest
price.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said voters should ask themselves
who would keep their bills down over the next four years and who would
'strive ceaselessly' for value for money.
In Northamptonshire, where Wellingborough district council recently set the
country's lowest council tax, Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary,
said the assertion that Conservative councils cost you less and serve you
better was 'not just a slogan - it's the truth'.
The remarks were targeted at the central plank of Labour's campaign: that
average council tax bills are Pounds 14 lower in Labour councils than their
Tory counterparts.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems scent victory in Newbury
contest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS confidently predicted that they would win Newbury in
tomorrow's by-election as Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, led the final
phases of their campaign in the once-safe Tory seat.
Mr Ashdown said: 'There is a lot of work to be done, a lot of votes to be
garnered. We believe that the issue is still close but we are confident that
victory is well within our grasp.'
The Liberal Democrats' upbeat mood yesterday, when nearly half the party's
20 MPs arrived in the constituency for a round of canvassing, suggests that
their private returns show them at least slightly in the lead.
Previously party officials had sounded sceptical about the weekend opinion
poll which put Mr David Rendel, their candidate, decisively ahead.
By contrast, Mr Julian Davidson, the Tory candidate, said he believed the
Conservatives had won the campaign conclusively. Yet again he recalled the
Tory victory in the general election in spite of unfavourable opinion polls.
The Conservatives' latest tactic is to distribute a leaflet with the Liberal
Democrat logo on the front, apologising for 'three major misrepresentations'
in the Liberal Democrat campaign. Mr Rendel and his campaign team dismissed
it as 'a sign of desperation'.
With just two days to go before voting, all the parties - even the fringe
candidates - have stepped up their activity. The most high-profile event was
a meeting last night for Mr Alan Sked - standing as an Anti-Federalist
candidate - attended by more than 500 people and addressed by Mr Enoch
Powell, the former Tory minister and veteran anti-Common Market campaigner.
The focus for the main parties now is to make sure their supporters vote
tomorrow. The Tories, defending a 12,357 majority in their 188th-safest
seattalk of a 60 per cent to 65 per cent turnout overall.
Both parties believe the result could depend on whether disaffected Tories
protest by staying at home or by changing their vote.
Labour's emphasis now is on maximising the anti-Tory vote.
Mr Peter Mandelson, the Labour MP who has been the party's campaign supremo,
said: 'We will be very satisfied with the defeat of the Conservatives and
that is the result we confidently expect . . . we will be very disappointed
if the Conservatives manage to hold the seat.'
Mr Ashdown used his visit to Newbury to talk-up the importance of the county
council elections in England and Wales, which also take place tomorrow. It
was, he said, 'not necessarily inconceivable' that the Tories might drop
into third place in terms of vote share in those elections.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Council tax - the dog that failed
to bark / Richard Evans finds Tory candidates surprised by voters' apathy
over the new property assessment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'PEOPLE are so fed up with recent changes in local taxation that they don't
seem to care what happens any more . . . the boredom factor has really set
in.'
This cynical comment from a senior local government official sums up a
widespread view. Predictions of a renewed political storm over the
introduction of the council tax have not been borne out during the campaign.
Leaders of the three main political parties in Cambridgeshire, for example,
have found it is way down the list of priority issues encountered on the
doorsteps of Peterborough, Cambridge and surrounding villages.
'Considering it is the first year of the new tax, and given the history that
preceded it, it is remarkable how little it has been featuring,' says Mr
John Horrell, Conservative majority leader on the county council.
Cambridgeshire has a relatively modest council tax precept of Pounds 390,
and about 65 per cent of householders are set to gain from the tax compared
with the community charge.
Cambridgeshire has what seems a comfortable Tory majority, but it was run
jointly by Labour and the Liberal Democrats between 1985-89, and would be
lost by the Tories on a 6 per cent swing.
Voters are certainly not ecstatic about the new property-based tax, but they
regard it as a substantial improvement on the poll tax, the introduction of
which led to rioting in Trafalgar Square.
Local Tories, although relieved that the new tax has generated very little
overt hostility, are worried about the impact of the tax on one important
category of voter - traditionally Conservative single pensioners, whose
fixed incomes are not related to the value of their homes.
Mr Peter Lee, the Liberal Democrat group leader, has picked up this concern
while canvassing, despite the low interest shown generally in the tax.
'The one group that is angry and upset is the single pensioner, as they only
get a reduction of 25 per cent on the full tax. In almost every case they
will be worse off compared with the poll tax, and it is definitely an issue
that is turning some of them against the Tories.'
He has also found a smaller, less cohesive group of relatively poor people
who now have to pay the full council tax compared with only 20 per cent of
the poll tax. 'The exemptions under the council tax do not seem to be as
generous and flexible.'
Mr Lee's overall impression is one of confusion over the new tax,
particularly the transitional arrangements to cushion its introduction,
together with a weariness over the whole subject of local finance. 'It is
not a big issue, partly because many people are better off under it, and
partly because people often can't remember exactly what they paid under the
old rates or the poll tax.'
Mrs Janet Jones, the Labour group leader, agrees. 'My impression is that
it's having very little effect, and many people are still more concerned
about the poll tax. I don't think many people really understand what is
going on.'

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANGES in rules for civil servants giving evidence to the Scott inquiry
into the sale of arms to Iraq indicate the need for legislation setting out
the role and responsibilities of civil servants, MPs were told yesterday.
Professor Peter Hennessey of Queen Mary College, London, told the
cross-party Treasury and Civil Service committee that the existing rules on
keeping advice to ministers confidential had been set aside for the inquiry
by Sir Robin Butler, head of the civil service.
Parliament, rather than an unelected official, should make such changes,
Prof Hennessey said. Legislation would put the rules governing civil
servants' behaviour on a statutory footing.
Prof Hennessey also backed the call by the FDA top civil servants' union for
an independent appeal body for civil servants who believed they had been
asked to behave unethically.
At present they must raise such matters with their line managers, with the
right to appeal to their permanent secretary and ultimately to the head of
the civil service.
However, he believed that civil servants would be reluctant to use this
appeal procedure, since their managers would often have been involved in
important decisions which led to disquiet. In the arms-to-Iraq affair, for
example, Sir Robin Butler had been present at some of the meetings
concerning the prosecution of the Matrix Churchill directors, he said.

ABOUT Pounds 15m of NHS funding is being poured down the drain each year
through inefficient use of water, the Audit Commission says in a report
today.
The commission says up to 30 per cent of the annual Pounds 52m spent on

THERE is now not a single National Health Service patient who has been
waiting for longer than 18 months for either a hip replacement or a cataract
operation, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, told MPs yesterday.
But Mr Win Griffiths, a Labour MP, said the waiting-list reduction stemmed
partly from a variety of 'devices'. One of these was for consultants to put
cases 'in their drawers' when they knew money was not available to fund the
required treatment.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday rejected criticism of the government's controversial
proposals for reforming the North Sea tax regime, saying they would be good
for jobs and good for Britain.
The prime minister said the reform would improve development incentives.
He was responding to criticism from Mr Robert Hughes, Labour MP for Aberdeen
North, who said the changes would 'savagely attack' small companies in the
drilling and exploration sector.
Under the Budget proposals, the rate at which petroleum revenue tax is
levied would fall from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and tax relief would be
abolished for exploratory drilling.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: House to rule on criteria for Emu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT con-firmed last night that the House of Commons would have an
opportunity to determine whether Britain was able to meet the European
Community's convergence criteria before embarking on economic and monetary
union under the Maastricht treaty, Ivor Owen writes.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, announced that
the government would provide for the necessary parliamentary proceedings by
agreeing to add a new Labour clause, subject to some technical changes, to
the Maastricht bill.
He also gave a further assurance that the treaty did not impose an
obligation on the government to return sterling to the European exchange
rate mechanism.
Mr Andrew Smith, a shadow treasury minister, hailed the announcement as a
'victory' and stressed that in reaching a judgment on the convergence
criteria MPs could take account of the effect on budget deficits and the
general co-ordination of economic policy.
Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, foreign office minister, confirmed last night that
as a result of its earlier defeat on the Maastricht bill the government
would appoint members of local councils to all 24 places allocated to
Britain on the EC's committee of the regions.

MR Tristan Garel-Jones, foreign office minister, confirmed last night that
as a results of its earlier defeat on the Maastricht bill the government
would appoint members of local councils to all 24 places allocated to
Britain on the European Community's committee of the regions, Ivor Owen
writes.
As the report stage of the measure got under way, the government's
acceptance that it could not revive its original proposal that
businesspeople should be included among the British representatives on the
committee was hailed as 'surrender' by Mr George Robertson from the Labour
front bench.
He stressed that during the committee stage the government had been defeated
on a Labour amendment requiring all the British members of the committee to
be elected concillors in spite of having entered into a 'conspiracy' with
Scottish and Welsh nationalist MPs.
Mr Robertson's claim that the nationalist parties had got nothing out of
their deal with the government was disputed by Mr Ieuan Wyn Jones (Plaid
Cymru Yns Mond) and Mrs Margaret Ewing (SNP Moray).
In a series of clashes, Mr Jones emphasised that although claiming to
support the Maastricht treaty Mr Robertson and his colleagues had voted 38
times with the Tory rebels who wanted to wreck it.
MR Garel-Jones said the government would consult all the political parties
before deciding on the composition of the British contingent on the
committee of the regions.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Investment banks 'stall' Maxwell
pension search
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO CITY investment banks are blocking efforts by liquidators of the Maxwell
pension fund management company to trace the ownership of nearly Pounds 130m
in assets that have gone missing, a select committee heard yesterday.
Mr Neil Cooper, partner at Robson Rhodes, liquidators to Bishopsgate
Investment Management, fund manager for more than Pounds 700m in Maxwell
company pension assets, told MPs he had been obliged to take the unusual
step of forcing the investment banks into court in order to obtain access to
staff or documents.
The two investment banks are Lehman Brothers International and Credit
Suisse, Mr Cooper said.
He added that it was highly unusual in insolvency for liquidators to have to
resort to the courts to obtain information. 'Most solicitors are aware of
the powers of liquidators and the vast majority of the information we
receive is obtained without court order,' he said.
Asked by Mr David Shaw, Conservative MP for Dover, to speculate on why the
investment banks were not co-operating, Mr Cooper said the banks may fear
that inquiries and subsequent actions may go beyond the question of
ownership of the contested securities.
In one case, MPs heard, Lehman Brothers, which had made an individual
available for extensive questioning, declined to produce the individual for
a second round of questions. Lehman Brothers said yesterday: 'We believe we
have been very co-operative.' It added that it felt the time had come to say
'enough is enough'. Lehman is believed to be holding Pounds 70m to Pounds
80m in assets that may belong to pensioners.
Credit Suisse, MPs heard, had refused to supply information and the
liquidators won a court order to force them to supply it. The bank then
challenged the order, forcing the liquidators back into the court, again
successfully.
Mr Cooper also said the liquidators were about to begin proceedings in
France to recover an estimated Pounds 33m of shares in Euris, an investment
bank, held by Banque Nationale de Paris.
The shares were allegedly transferred by the former directors of Bishopsgate
to Banque Nationale where they allegedly served as collateral for a loan to
Headington Holdings, a privately-owned company of the late Mr Robert
Maxwell.
Mr Cooper said the current administrators to Headington Holdings, Arthur
Andersen, confirm that they have no legal title to the shares.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Stronger pound fails to win appreciation: Manufacturers'
fears that sterling's rise might damage their export business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE finance director of an engineering company said last week that if the
government allows the pound to strengthen any further 'then it must be out
of its tiny mind'.
Mr Miles Vere-Hodge, director of corporate finance at TI, the specialist
engineering group, said:'I am concerned that if the pound goes much further
than it is now it will start to hurt exports, particularly with countries
like France and Germany in recession and the US becoming more introverted.
'The government seems to be giving up some of the benefits that we gained
from September's departure from the ERM.'
Since February the pound has risen more than 5 per cent and last month broke
through the DM2.50 level, its highest point since September. Sir David Lees,
chairman of GKN, the engineering company, warned that another 5 per cent
'would be worrying'.
Just over half a year has passed since sterling left the European exchange
rate mechanism. After its initial plunge on September 16 the currency
drifted downwards to hit a low of DM2.31 during February 24, a devaluation
of about 17 per cent from its DM2.78 floor in the mechanism.
For exporters, the pound's decline was a gift from heaven. Goods priced in
sterling were instantaneously cheaper allowing British industry to push for
an ever wider share of world export trade and raising hopes for an
export-led domestic recovery.
The benefits are already apparent. Last week the Confederation of British
Industry said exports were leading the country out of recession. It reported
that in the past four months there had been a significant increase in demand
for exports. Manufacturers expect the next four months to bring the
strongest growth in orders and output for four years.
However, with the pound creeping steadily higher against the dollar and
European currencies, Britain's exporters have become alarmed that the
recently won competitive gains of devaluation are about to be put in
jeopardy.
Industrialists can draw little comfort from the government's stance.
Chancellor Norman Lamont has said that he does not have a target for the
exchange rate but has, on other occasions, made it clear that he favours a
strong currency.
In Luxembourg two weeks ago he indicated that the government would like to
see sterling appreciate, partly to offset inflationary pressures.
'I welcome strongly the recent strength of sterling,' he said.
Prospects for another base rate cut, perhaps to offset the pound's rise, are
also weak. In his Budget speech in March, Mr Lamont said base rates of 6 per
cent were consistent with a sustainable recovery.
The Treasury pointed out that although the pound was now somewhat higher
than it was in February, there had still been a significant devaluation
compared with September.
Meanwhile, ministers are insisting that competitiveness is more to do with
controlling costs and keeping down wages than a low exchange rate.
Mr Ian Thompson, economist at the Engineering Employers' Federation, said
that manufacturers would always prefer a lower exchange rate but said recent
concern about the pound's appreciation was exaggerated.
He said: 'Our view is that the bulk of the devaluation benefit is still
there, even at the present exchange rate. The pound would have to increase a
lot before we lost that benefit.'
The worry for exporters is that, on balance, the pound is more likely to
appreciate than depreciate over the next few months. Interest rates in
Germany are on a downward path, making the D-Mark a less attractive currency
to hold. The UK economy is stirring out of recession and many analysts
believe base rates have hit bottom.
Mr James Barty, economist at Morgan Grenfell, said he believes the exchange
rate is about right.
He said: 'There are worrying signs that the government wants sterling to
strengthen significantly. This could damage the trade position and
sustainability of the recovery. Do they never learn?'

FT  05 MAY 93 / Miners hope to create 900 jobs in recycling joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Union of Democratic Mineworkers has joined forces with Vista
Partnership, a private consortium, in a venture aiming to create up to 900
jobs for former miners in environmental projects.
The two announced yesterday that they had formed a company, Vista-UDM, which
will build domestic waste recycling and disposal facilities on the sites of
abandoned pits - initially those of Cotgrave and Silverhill in
Nottinghamshire.
The schemes involve the creation of a plant to convert unsorted waste into
an absorbent aggregate used in industry, construction and land reclamation,
as well as a car recycling business in collaboration with BMW, the German
carmaker. The company estimates it will produce annual net exports worth
about Pounds 50m.
Formal negotiations on the projects are scheduled to begin with British Coal
on May 13. Informal talks have already been held with Mr Tim Eggar, the
energy minister, which the UDM said had been 'extremely positive'.
The union expects to secure grants from the government and the European
Community to establish the business.
Meanwhile, it emerged that more than 13,000 miners have left British Coal
since October, 2,600 of them in the past week. The latest voluntary
redundancies leave British Coal with less than 25,000 blue-collar employees.
British Coal has already achieved more than half the 25,000 manual job cuts
it sought through mine closures last October in spite of the scaling-back of
the mine- closure programme from 31 to 19 pits.
The redundancies are being taken on a voluntary basis and represent a
setback for unions which are still fighting closures. Disputes over British
Coal's closure consultation procedures are expected to return to the High
Court in the next few weeks.
This, however, is unlikely to save any of the pits. Miners at some
collieries, including Shirebrook, Rossington, Houghton Main, Markham Main
and Easington have already voted to accept local deals on improved
redundancies. British Coal says this signifies approval for closure.
Under the local deals, negotiated in the past few weeks, some miners will
gain up to Pounds 8,000 more than under the national deal. This is lifting
the average payment to above the previous Pounds 26,000.

FT  05 MAY 93 / 15 schools to become technology colleges
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 15 schools could become city technology colleges next year under plans
being developed by the City Technology Colleges Trust.
The trust hopes to use a change to the law, introduced in the Education Bill
now before parliament, which will allow established schools to take
technology college status if they have opted out of local education
authority control. The colleges, introduced in the Education Reform Act of
1988, were at first intended to be purpose-built new schools funded only by
business sponsorship.
Under the trust's plans commercial sponsors would provide a minimum of
Pounds 50,000 a school, while the government would provide at least Pounds
200,000.
This new route to technology college status is thought to offer similar
standards for a lower cost than that of a purpose-built college, which
requires backing of about Pounds 8m from companies.
The Department for Education said yesterday that the criteria used to vet
each application had not yet been decided by ministers.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Code for 'green' advisers launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST registration scheme and code of practice to ensure that
environmental consultants achieve a minimum quality standard was launched by
the sector's leading trade body yesterday.
The Association of Environmental Consultancies has approved a code of
practice and a system to register and monitor its members.
The scheme has been introduced partly in response to concerns over the
quality of advice provided by a growing number of consultants.
There are more than 300 companies calling themselves environmental
consultants, yet there has been no system for assessing the quality of
advice that they provide.
The registration scheme comes at a time when businesses are under growing
pressure to hire consultants to help comply with regulations and guidelines.
These include the 1990 Environmental Protection Act; BS7750, the standard on
environmental management systems; and Emas, the European Community's
ecological auditing and management scheme.
Consultants wishing to become 'AEC registered environmental audit practices'
will be subject to an initial audit, a second visit within a year and then
additional audits at least every two years.
The audits will be carried out by other registered firms and with
supervision from an independent team at Imperial College, London.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Recovery to be 'patchy' survey says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WARNING that the expected recovery will be 'patchy' has come from a survey
conducted by Trade Indemnity, a credit insurance group, Peter Marsh writes.
Out of 728 companies, 46 per cent said they expected an upturn. Ten per cent
expected activity to continue to decline.
The companies said sales were higher in the first quarter of this year than
in any of the quarters last year.
Only 5 per cent said cancelled orders had declined in the quarter compared
with the final three months of 1992.
Trade Indemnity said the survey contained some 'positive signals' but
business failures and bad debts 'will continue to plague the economy for
some time'.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Tory peer quits school tests council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Skidelsky, a Tory member of the assessment council which sets the
national curriculum tests, yesterday resigned from the body, accusing the
Department for Education of a 'bunker mentality'.
His move attacks the review of the national curriculum by Sir Ron Dearing,
which was announced last month by Mr John Patten, the education secretary.
Two teaching unions have imposed boycotts on the tests, while a third, the
National Union of Teachers, is expected to follow next week.
Lord Skidelsky, an SDP life peer who last year took the Tory whip in the
Lords, said: 'Over the last 12 months the efforts of myself and others to
get the problems of an incoherent testing system decently discussed have
been frustrated by the bunker mentality of the Department for Education. Now
the unique chance opened up by the teachers' boycott for a coherent,
independent review of the main issues is being thrown away.'
Sir Ron, chairman of the Schools Examination and Assessment Council, last
week announced a task force of six to assist him with the review. But Lord
Skidelsky, a member of the council since last August, believes Mr Patten
should have created a 'properly constituted review committee of high
calibre, controlling its own procedures and report'.
Instead, according to Lord Skidelsky, 'the main lines of inquiry have been
decided by Sir Ron and a few colleagues without any prior consultation with
his colleagues'.
Mr Patten said he regretted Lord Skidelsky's decision, but added: 'He has
very firmly held views on testing and I hope he will make them known to Sir
Ron Dearing whose independent review has been so widely welcomed.'
The department added that several members of Sir Ron's task force were 'not
necessarily politically subservient to the department'.
Mr John Major and Mr John Smith clashed over the tests for the second time
in a week, with the prime minister again rejecting the Labour leader's
demands that they should be withdrawn.
Mr Smith asked why private schools were being exempted from the tests if
they were so important.
Mr Major said it was the public sector for which the government had direct
responsibility. In the private sector results had been 'very good' and many
schools had their own tests. He accused Mr Smith of being prepared to 'join
forces with those who want industrial militancy to end the tests'.

FT  05 MAY 93 / House prices are 'poised to recover'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES showed a modest rise of 0.1 per cent last month according to
Nationwide, Britain's second-largest building society.
The figure represents the second consecutive monthly rise, but March's
increase was 1 per cent.
Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide's operations director, said: 'Overall, we have
seen little change in house prices over the last six months and this month's
figure is further evidence that stability is now returning to the housing
market.'
Mr Davis expected growing confidence over the next few months with
house-price recovery aided by first-time buyers entering the market.
The average UK house price in April was Pounds 52,339, 5.8 per cent lower
than the same month last year, said Nationwide.
Meanwhile, there were 218,867 residential property transactions in the first
quarter of this year - 4 per cent lower than the last quarter of 1992 and 8
per cent lower than last year's first quarter, according to the Adams
Residential Property Index. This is compiled by James R. Adams, a market
research consultancy, by monitoring housing completions made by solicitors.
Activity in construction remains low but the decline in quantity surveyors'
workload has begun to slow, says a survey published today by the Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Quantity surveyors' workloads fell 0.7
per cent in the first quarter of this year, compared with a 5 per cent drop
in the final quarter of 1992. Workload over the past 12 months has fallen 13
per cent.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Tough champion of water privatisation / Obituary of Sir Roy
Watts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR ROY WATTS, chairman of Thames Water since 1983, was one of the driving
forces behind the water industry's 1989 privatisation.
Much of the industry, unconvinced of his views at the time, grew to share
his belief that long-neglected modernisation would have been impossible
without privatisation.
He was adamant, too, that customers should be put first, although
modernisation meant that bills had to rise. He said Thames regarded hosepipe
bans as a failure, and was proud that it sent out the lowest bills of the
largest 10 water companies. He felt it was the industry's misfortune,
however, that improvements tended to remain 'unseen and unsung'.
Sir Roy was criticised 18 months after privatisation when his remuneration
doubled to Pounds 155,000. He responded that he was 'worth every penny'.
Although he took a pay cut last summer when bonuses were squeezed,
controversy flared again when Thames revealed that it had donated Pounds
50,000 to the Conservative party before the general election because 'the
return of a Conservative government was in the interests of the company and
its shareholders'.
Fellow water chairmen, who remember his competitiveness and fierce pursuit
of efficiency with respect, also describe him as a private and thoughtful
man. Sir Michael Straker, chairman of Northumbrian Water, said: 'He didn't
easily come out of his business shell, but although he had a very serious
face he had a twinkle in his eye. He was very tough and determined, but a
very lovable man, gentle and quietly spoken.'
He was widely regarded as the most senior of the water chairmen, both
because Thames is the largest company and because of his considerable
experience outside the industry.
Sir Roy was born on August 17 1925 in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, and
educated at Doncaster Grammar School and Edinburgh University. He served in
the 8th Royal Tank Regiment from 1943 to 1947 in Europe and Palestine, and
entered local government as an accountant before joining British European
Airways in 1955. He became British Airways' chief executive in 1979 and
joint deputy chairman in 1980.
He left BA two years after Lord King was appointed chairman. Former
colleagues say that he had hoped to be chairman, and although he had
initiated some efficiency measures he had felt squeezed out as one of the
'old guard' when the King-inspired transformation of BA took hold.
He received the CBE in 1978 and a knighthood last year.
Thames said it believed he had been diagnosed as having Parkinson's Disease,
on April 13. According to industry colleagues he had been depressed since
the disease was confirmed and had also been deeply upset by the death on
April 6 of Mr Charles Stuart, a close friend and colleague.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Code for 'green' advisers launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST registration scheme and code of practice to ensure that
environmental consultants achieve a minimum quality standard was launched by
the leading trade body yesterday.
The Association of Environmental Consultancies has approved a code of
practice and a system to register and monitor its members.
The scheme has been introduced partly in response to concerns over the
quality of advice provided by a growing number of consultants.
Mr Geoff Mills, chairman of consultants Gibb Environmental and chairman of
the working party which compiled the code, said: 'Standards do vary widely.
We aim to develop standards which give confidence to buyers of our
services.'
There are more than 300 companies calling themselves environmental
consultants, yet there has been no system for assessing the quality of
advice that they provide.
The registration scheme comes at a time when businesses are under growing
pressure to hire consultants to help comply with regulations.
These include the 1990 Environmental Protection Act; BS7750, the standard on
environmental management systems; and Emas, the European Community's
ecological auditing and management scheme.
Consultants wishing to become 'AEC registered environmental audit practices'
will be subject to an initial audit, a second visit within a year and then
additional audits at least every two years.
The audits will be carried out by other registered firms and with
supervision from an independent team at Imperial College, London.
So far 18 of the UK's largest consultants have registered for the scheme,
including Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Arthur D. Little and Environmental Resources.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Mayhew seeks US backing on N Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PATRICK Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday met senior US
politicians to try to win backing for British policy in Northern Ireland and
deflect American sympathy for republican fundraisers.
Sir Patrick, who spoke with state department officials in Washington and was
expected to see Mr Tom Foley, the speaker of the House of Representatives,
and Senator Edward Kennedy, is also understood to have reiterated UK
opposition to the sending of a US 'peace envoy' mooted by President Clinton.
The British government has, however, made it clear that it would accept a
delegation with a less specific role.
The government is also concerned about the adoption of the so-called
'MacBride principles' for company investment policies by US state and city
governments.
The principles are meant to promote employment of Roman Catholics but the
government argues that existing 'fair employment' laws are sufficiently
tough.
Speaking earlier in New York, Sir Patrick said that Noraid, the US
fundraising group that wants a united Ireland, was a declining force unable
to collect money for the IRA.
Although the IRA claimed to be freedom fighters, Sir Patrick said that all
they were fighting for was 'freedom from the common obligations of
humanity'.
One of President Clinton's top advisers Mr Ray Flynn, the US
ambassador-designate to the Vatican, said yesterday that Mr Clinton was as
committed now to helping break the political logjam as he was during the
presidential campaign.
In Londonderry Mr Flynn, the Mayor of Boston, said: 'I do feel the president
is very committed to playing a constructive, positive and meaningful role in
helping to end the violence in Northern Ireland.'
Mr Flynn, who is on a three-day fact-finding visit to Ireland, said he
supported the talks between Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, and Mr Gerry
Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, and believed Sinn Fein should be involved in
any talks process.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Daf workers accept pay freeze to 1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE workforce at the Leyland Daf truck assembly plant at Leyland,
Lancashire, has accepted a pay freeze to the end of 1994 and a package of
far-reaching reforms in working practices in support of the management bid
to rescue the plant.
The management buy-out team, led by Mr John Gilchrist, the managing
director, is the frontrunner to take over the Leyland Daf truck operations,
which went into administrative receivership in February as part of the
financial collapse of Daf, the Anglo-Dutch commercial vehicle maker.
About 700 jobs at the truck assembly plant would be saved by the proposed
management buy-out.
The buy-out bid does not include a further 350 Leyland Daf jobs at the
nearby components plant, technical centre and test track, for which a
separate management buy-out is being planned.
The truck plant management said yesterday that the workforce had voted
unanimously to back the pay and conditions deal.
Under the terms of the deal the truck plant would adopt team-working and
there would be 'totally flexible working arrangements' with no demarcation
lines.
All employees would be classed as staff, and there would be 'single-table
bargaining' with the trade unions.
'These arrangements and ways of working are at the leading edge of European
manufacturing practices,' Mr Gilchrist said last night.
The unions had made clear that 'the agreements reached are on offer only to
the MBO team and are a clear sign of their support for the buy-out team,' he
said.
The deal on working practices incorporates many of the reforms already
introduced or sought by other vehicle makers in the UK. There will be no
clocking in and out, there will be a single-status car park, and salary
payments will be made 13 times a year direct to employees' bank accounts.
The deal on flexibility over working hours is expected to set a new standard
in the UK motor industry, with agreement for hours to be varied by up to 20
per cent a week - without overtime compensation.
The working week has been set at 37 hours, but hours worked up to 45 a week
would also be paid at standard time without any overtime pay. If weekly
hours were reduced to 29 hours, workers would receive a day off at basic
pay.
Pay was last increased at the plant by 3.5 per cent in January, the first
increase since September 1990. The new pay freeze will apply to the
beginning of 1995.

FT  05 MAY 93 / American boost helps lift Jaguar output 56%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAGUAR, the UK luxury carmaker, has increased production by 56 per cent in
the first four months of the year, helped by a recovery in demand in the US,
its single biggest market.
Jaguar sales in the US rose by 22 per cent last month to 1,011. Its US sales
in the first four months of the year at 3,572 were 27 per cent higher than a
year ago.
The company said yesterday that its sales in the US had been boosted by the
offer to buyers to return cars within 30 days if they were not satisfied.
The recovery in sales in the US and in some other markets such as the UK and
Germany has allowed Jaguar to increase production to 9,953 in the first four
months from 6,391 in the same period a year ago.
The higher production has been achieved by a much smaller workforce with the
number of hourly paid manufacturing employees cut by nearly a quarter in the
last year to 3,119 by the end of last month from 4,078 a year ago.
However, Jaguar, a subsidiary of Ford of the US, is still struggling to
overcome heavy losses. In the first quarter of this year it cut its pre-tax
loss - under UK accounting rules - by 27 per cent to Pounds 28.6m from a
loss of Pounds 39.4m in the same period a year ago.
Jaguar's wholesale deliveries worldwide in the first three months rose to
6,284 from 5,164 a year earlier.
Its sales to customers in the first quarter rose by 16 per cent year-on-year
to 6,374, helped by a 29 per cent rise in the US to 2,561 and increases in
Germany, Switzerland, the UK and Belgium.

BRITISH Telecommunications yesterday announced cuts in the cost of line
connection for both business and domestic customers, Alan Cane writes. The
changes bring the cost of installing the first telephone for a business with
a single line down to Pounds 116.33, including value added tax, from Pounds
179.49.
The corresponding reduction for home lines is from Pounds 163.75 to Pounds
116.33. The cuts will be effective from June 1 this year. The new prices are
part of BT's compliance with its agreement with Oftel, the
telecommunications regulator, to keep price changes on a range of services
to 6.25 percentage points below the rate of inflation.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Nissan accused over fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR executive from Nissan Motor Corporation, the Japanese car maker,
made the business introduction for the setting up of a Swiss bank account
which the Inland Revenue claims was part of a Pounds 97m corporation tax
fraud, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday.
Mr Friedrich Pannosch, an Austrian rail consultant, was giving evidence in
the trial of Mr Michael Hunt, the Nissan UK director accused of taking part
in the fraud. The prosecution claims that directors of Nissan UK, the
British importer of Nissan cars, and others, inflated freight charges to
avoid tax and laundered money through shipping agents into Swiss bank
accounts.
Mr Pannosch is accused of involvement in the conspiracy but he has not been
charged.
Mr Pannosch, a prosecution witness, said he was introduced to Mr Tore
Thorsen, a Norwegian shipping agent, who is one of the other alleged
conspirators, by a Mr Yoshiro Saegusa, a senior executive with Nissan Japan.
Mr Pannosch told Mr Michael Sherrard QC, counsel for Mr Hunt, that Mr
Saegusa had said Mr Thorsen was helping Nissan Japan with transport
problems.
The Norwegian asked him to open an account in his own name because the
transactions could not be made directly and needed an intermediary. About
USDollars 200 passed through the account, the court heard.
The trial continues today.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Fresh competition powers welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's proposals to give the Office of Fair Trading tougher powers
to tackle monopolistic and anti-competitive behaviour have been warmly
welcomed by Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading.
In his first public statement on abuse of market power since the government
announced its preferred option for reform of the law last month, Sir Bryan
said he particularly welcomed the proposal to allow the director-general to
accept and enforce undertakings without carrying out a formal investigation.
In the magazine, In Competition, he said that in contrast to his power to
accept undertakings to allow mergers to go ahead without a reference to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, his power to accept non-statutory
assurances on anti-competitive behaviour had proved ineffective. The
extension of the 'fix it first' philosophy to anti-competitive behaviour
combined with tougher investigatory powers for the body should considerably
shorten the process of dealing with abuses of market power.
Businesses could not be pressurised into giving undertakings and the lack of
a full investigation might mean that other matters of concern were
overlooked. But that would be a price worth paying for speeding up the whole
process.
Mr Christopher Bright, a partner with City solicitors Linklaters &amp; Paines
and editor of In Competition, said Sir Bryan's statement was 'significant'
because it showed 'a new attitude to the use of the current law'. The 1980
Competition Act 1980 had not worked partly because the office had been too
cautious in enforcing it, he said.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Eddie George shuns moralising role
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR EDDIE GEORGE, governor designate of the Bank of England, yesterday told a
City congregation he had no intention of setting himself up as a moral
'soothsayer' for the British banking system, Gillian Tett writes.
Mr George was speaking to a lunchtime meeting at St Mary le Bow on Cheapside
at the invitation of the rector, Victor Stock.
He said: 'I will endeavour to do my best to avoid becoming a soothsayer . .
. it is terribly important that we should not pretend to be able to do more
than we possibly can do.'
Mr George faced tough questioning from Mr Stock on the Bank's role in the
regulation of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
He said: 'If we were to attempt to ensure that no institution failed we
would have such tight regulations on all those financial institutions that
they would find it extremely difficult to serve the community.'

FT  05 MAY 93 / Press moves to head off statutory controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEWSPAPER industry yesterday outlined steps to strengthen
self-regulation in an attempt to head off statutory controls.
The plans range from altering the membership of the Press Complaints
Commission to ensure a non-press majority, to the creation of a telephone
helpline for the public.
The helpline, to be run by the commission, will give immediate advice to
anyone fearing that the code of practice governing journalists' behaviour is
about to be breached. It will also provide the telephone and fax numbers of
the editors involved.
Mr Harry Roche, chairman of the Press Standards Board of Finance (Pressbof),
the body which co-ordinates the newspaper and magazine industry's actions on
self-regulation, said yesterday that the industry was 'totally opposed to
statutory regulation'. However, it recognised the need for a responsible
press which commanded the respect of the public.
The changes announced yesterday come in response to proposals for a
statutory press complaints commission from Sir David Calcutt, who chaired
the commission on the press and privacy. The Commons national heritage
committee has advocated a statutory press ombudsman, and the bill put before
parliament by Labour MP Mr Clive Soley proposed a press authority with
statutory powers.
In future the Press Complaints Commission, the self-regulatory body funded
by Pressbof, will be made up of eight non-press members, seven editors and
the independent chairman.
Mr Peter Preston, editor of The Guardian, said there should be talks across
the industry to see whether a common approach could be agreed on how
newsgatherers treat victims of tragedy.
The government has not yet announced its position apart from emphasising
that it plans to go ahead with measures to outlaw electronic eavesdropping
and the use of telephoto lenses on private property. Such measures are
accepted in principle by the industry as long as they apply to everyone and
not just to journalists.

FT  05 MAY 93 / ITV seeks new era for broadcasting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITV companies yesterday asked the government to look beyond the debate
on the future of the BBC and instead produce 'a new blueprint for a new
era'.
The television companies also argued for equality of treatment with cable
and satellite channels.
In their response to the government's green paper on the future of the BBC
the ITV companies call for:
Changes to ownership rules covering television.
A closing of the 'loophole' that allows News International to own 35 per
cent of the British national press and 50 per cent of British Sky
Broadcasting, the satellite venture in which Pearson, owner of the Financial
Times, has a stake.
Parity of regulation for all commercial broadcasters so that all cable and
satellite channels available in the UK would, like ITV, have to meet the EC
requirement for a minimum 51 per cent of programmes to be made in Europe.
In their submission to the National Heritage Department, the ITV companies
say that the 1990 Broadcasting Act which dealt with commercial television
was a retrospective document rather than a blueprint for a more volatile
future. ITV argues: 'The discussion leading to the next BBC charter in 1996
cannot make sense without careful consideration of the industry as a whole.'
The ITV case is backed by a study by consultants Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton on
the economic implications of the rapid changes in broadcasting. The
consultants argue that only 19 per cent of all programmes on channels
available in the UK last year were made in Europe. This could fall to 13 per
cent by the end of the decade.
Booz Allen says a 1991 trade deficit of Pounds 100m on television programmes
will rise to Pounds 640m by the end of the decade without government action.
Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of the ITV Association and LWT chief executive, said:
'If we're not careful the British television production industry could go
the same way as the British film industry.'
BBC transmitters should be privatised, ITV argues, to provide competition
for National Transcommunications, the Independent Broadcasting Authority's
privatised transmitting and engineering arm.
The ITV companies were unable to agree on whether they wanted an extension
of the moratorium on takeovers, which runs out at the end of this year.
Instead the government is asked to examine 'the existing ownership
regulations in broadcasting in the light of the major changes that are
likely to occur in the industry from the mid 1990s on'.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Murdoch staff to vote on pay plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RUPERT MURDOCH'S News International is balloting its employees, seeking
their agreement to a government-approved profit-related pay scheme.
The scheme would replace the annual salary review for the 1993-1994
financial year and might be extended for a further 12 months.
Under government regulations at least 80 per cent of all employees must
approve the proposal by May 19 for it to come into force. The maximum
tax-free PRP element of total pay can be 20 per cent or Pounds 4,000,
whichever is the lower.
News International is proposing that 15 per cent or Pounds 3,000 of an
employee's salary, whichever is the lower, will be the PRP element of their
pay.
The company says it will assume that anybody who does not vote in the ballot
approves of the scheme.
News International director Mr August Fischer, in a letter to employees,
says if the scheme is successful in the first year the company's 'present
intention would be to continue it for a second year and possibly expand the
scheme to the full tax-free PRP allowance'. He adds that the benefit of the
scheme will be that it can 'allow a greater rise in take-home pay than would
have been possible in any review, since inflation is running at such a low
rate'.
Someone earning Pounds 25,000 a year would be paid Pounds 3,000 of it in
PRP, equivalent to a Pounds 750 pay rise. More than 100 journalists working
on magazines published by Morgan Grampian will take a second consecutive day
of strike action today in protest at their employer's plan to de-recognise
the National Union of Journalists.
Morgan Grampian, which publishes magazines including The Engineer and Pulse,
said all titles would be published as planned.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Workers face cut in injury payouts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYEES who are injured at work as the result of a crime could have the
amount of compensation they can claim cut by at least half because of
government plans to reform the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme, one of
the largest firms of trade union solicitors said yesterday.
A worker who is physically hurt or suffers psychological damage following an
assault or any other crime can at present claim compensation under the
scheme for loss of earnings as well as for the injury itself. Claimants
include assaulted teachers and firefighters hurt in fires caused by arson.
The government is expected in a white paper this summer to propose a new
'tariff' system for compensation. Victims would no longer have the severity
of their injuries assessed by experts; instead there would be a standard
scale of payments administered by civil servants. Actual loss of earnings or
the individual's personal circumstances would not be taken into account.
Robin Thompson &amp; Partners, a firm of solicitors which handles injury claims
for most public-sector unions, said it estimated that at least half of
current awards to employees under the scheme consisted of loss-of-earnings
payments.
The Home Office, which oversees the scheme, said there had been complaints
about delays in payments. The white paper would put forward ways of
streamlining the system and payments would in future 'reflect the
seriousness of the injury in round terms'.
A Sikh police officer yesterday accepted Pounds 25,000 compensation after
Nottinghamshire Constabulary admitted he had suffered racial discrimination.
Mr Joginder Prem told an industrial tribunal that he had suffered abuse
since joining the force in 1983 and that he had been passed over for
promotion to sergeant.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Miners take redundancy as hopes dim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN half the 25,000 manual job cuts British Coal sought through mine
closures last October have been achieved by voluntary means in spite of the
scaling-back of the mine-closure programme from 31 to 19 pits.
The pace of departure of mineworkers is quickening as more of them accept
the inevitability of closures. More than 13,000 have left since October,
2,600 of them in the last week. The latest redundancies leave British Coal
with less than 25,000 blue-collar employees.
The redundancies are being taken on a voluntary basis and represent a
setback for unions which are still fighting closures. Disputes over British
Coal's closure consultation procedures are expected to return to the High
Court in the next few weeks.
This, however, is unlikely to save any of the pits. Miners at some
collieries, including Shirebrook, Rossington, Houghton Main, Markham Main
and Easington have already voted to accept local deals on improved
redundancies. British Coal says this signifies approval for closure.
Under the local deals, negotiated in the last few weeks, some miners will
gain up to Pounds 8,000 more than under the national deal. This is lifting
the average payment to above the previous Pounds 26,000.
The pace of redundancies has also been influenced by the cessation of mining
last week at five pits which are earmarked for closure or mothballing. These
will joined on Friday by Easington and Westoe, both in the north-east of
England, which are to be maintained in a state where mining could be
resumed. But the chances of them re-opening are remote.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Determined proponent of water privatisation / Obituary of
Sir Roy Watts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR ROY WATTS, chairman of Thames Water since 1983, was one of the driving
forces behind the water industry's controversial 1989 privatisation.
Much of the water industry, unconvinced of his views at the time, grew to
share his belief that long-neglected modernisation would have been
impossible without privatisation. In a Financial Times interview last
November he said that in government hands, Thames would have had no chance
of financing the ambitious Pounds 250m Ring Main, the watercourse encircling
London, for which tunnelling was completed early this year.
He was adamant, too, that customers should be put first, although
modernisation meant that bills had to rise. He said Thames regarded hosepipe
bans as a failure, and was proud that it sent out the lowest bills of the
largest 10 water companies. He felt it was the industry's misfortune,
however, that improvements tended to remain 'unseen and unsung'.
Sir Roy was criticised 18 months after privatisation when his remuneration
doubled to Pounds 155,000. He responded that he was 'worth every penny'.
Although he took a pay cut last summer when bonuses were squeezed,
controversy flared again when Thames revealed that it had donated Pounds
50,000 to the Conservative party before the general election because 'the
return of a Conservative government was in the interests of the company and
its shareholders'.
Fellow water chairmen, who remember his competitiveness and fierce pursuit
of efficiency with respect, also describe him as a private and thoughtful
man. Sir Michael Straker, chairman of Northumbrian Water, said: 'He didn't
easily come out of his business shell, but although he had a very serious
face he had a twinkle in his eye. He was very tough and determined, but a
very lovable man, gentle and quietly spoken.'
He was widely regarded as the most senior of the water chairmen, both
because Thames is the largest company and because of his considerable
experience outside the industry.
Sir Roy was born on August 17 1925 in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, and
educated at Doncaster Grammar School and Edinburgh University. He served in
the 8th Royal Tank Regiment from 1943 to 1947 in Europe and Palestine, and
entered local government as an accountant before joining British European
Airways in 1955. He became British Airways' chief executive in 1979 and
joint deputy chairman in 1980.
While at BA he helped launch the UK shuttle services. He said then that
airlines should fit their timetables around customers' needs, not the other
way around.
He left BA two years after Lord King was appointed chairman. Former
colleagues say that he had hoped to be chairman, and although he had
initiated some efficiency measures he had felt squeezed out as one of the
'old guard' when the King-inspired transformation of BA took hold.
After moving to Thames he held a number of other chairmanships: he led
Armstrong Equipment, the automotive company, from 1986 until it was taken
over three years later, and Lowndes Lambert Group, the insurance broker,
from 1988 to 1992.
From 1991 he was also chairman of IBC, the publishing and conference group,
and of Frank Graham Group, consulting engineers. He received the CBE in 1978
and a knighthood last year.
According to industry colleagues he had been depressed since he was
diagnosed as having Parkinson's Disease two months ago. He had also been
deeply upset, they said, by the death on April 6 of Mr Charles Stuart, who
had been a close friend as well as a long-standing colleague.
Sir Roy married Jean Rosaline in 1951; they had three children.

FT  05 MAY 93 / 15 schools may be converted into City technology colleges
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 15 schools could be converted into city technology colleges next year
under plans being developed by the City Technology Colleges Trust.
The trust hopes to use a change to the law, introduced in the Education Bill
now before parliament, which will allow established schools to take
technology college status if they have opted out of local education
authority control. The colleges, introduced in the Education Reform Act of
1988, were at first intended to be purpose-built new schools funded only by
business sponsorship.
Under the trust's plans commercial sponsors would provide a minimum of
Pounds 50,000 a school, while the government would provide at least Pounds
200,000. This new route to technology college status is thought to offer
similar standards for a lower cost than that of a purpose-built college,
which requires backing of about Pounds 8m from companies.
Sir Cyril Taylor, chairman of the trust, said 31 schools had already been
approved to become technology college affiliates after increasing the length
of the school day and introducing more science and technology courses. He
said there was a backlog of schools wanting to apply. Between 10 and 15 of
the 31 will be put forward for full college status once the Education Bill
becomes law.
The Department for Education said yesterday that the criteria used to vet
each application had not yet been decided.

FT  05 MAY 93 / World Trade News: China ready to buy 47 Boeings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA expects to buy at least 47 Boeing passenger aircraft this year at an
estimated cost of Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.03bn), among other orders for
aircraft such as the European Airbus and the Fokker-100.
Mr Ye Yigan, president of the China Aviation Supplies Corporation (CASC),
estimated this week that Chinese demand, mostly for passenger aircraft,
would average about 40 a year for the foreseeable future.
'I believe China will purchase more this year than in 1992, when domestic
passenger and freight transport volumes jumped by 28 per cent over 1991,' Mr
Ye told the English-language Business Weekly.
China's huge demand for new aircraft reflects a surge in traffic - passenger
numbers have grown by at least 20 per cent annually since 1984 - coinciding
with the country's 'open door' reforms and a boom which produced an economic
growth rate last year of nearly 13 per cent.
China's Boeing orders this year include 20 150-seater 737-300s with six
options, and one Boeing 757-200.
The Chinese are also reported to have signed for six new-generation 777s to
be delivered in 1995.
Boeing deliveries to China in 1992 will account for about 14 per cent of the
company's total. It expects China to purchase about 800 of its aircraft over
the next 15 years.
European Airbus also recently clinched a deal for 12 aircraft worth about
Dollars 1bn, with options for about a dozen more.
'The market is exploding,' said a western supplier of aircraft technology
this week. 'Nobody can believe that the airline market can grow so fast.'
Fuelling the boom is the rapid growth in new airlines. At least 42 airlines,
including six big carriers, are now operating in China, with three more
awaiting approval.
Mr Ye said that as well as buying new aircraft, CASC was importing more of
such items as navigation aids to upgrade facilities at dozens of airstrips
around the vast country. He estimated that since 1980 China had imported
aviation supplies worth Dollars 10bn.
Among other foreign aircraft makers engaged in the China business are
McDonnell Douglas of the US, which has been involved in a joint venture in
Shanghai since the mid-1980s; and Saab-Scania of Sweden, which is
negotiating with the Xian Aircraft Corporation to produce the 100-seat
Saab-2000.
The sales boom and increasing talk of co-production deals coincide with
publication of a fairly gloomy assessment of the Chinese aviation industry
in the official Outlook magazine which posed the question: 'What is wrong
with Chinese civil aviation?'
The magazine reported big increases in activity, including a surge last year
of 30 per cent in passenger traffic, and purchases of some 56 aircraft. But
the article concluded: 'Just as the old saying goes, 'we've bought the horse
but can't afford the saddle'.
'Ground facilities, including communications systems, radar navigation and
weather forecasting, cannot cope with the rapid increase in numbers of
planes,' it added. 'Maintenance is another problem, and so, too, is trained
staff. An investigation into a plane crash last year showed the pilot had
been overworking for several months.'
As an illustration of the problems of overwork and exhaustion, the magazine
quoted this exchange between a pilot and hostess. 'Why can't you smile when
you serve the passengers?' The young woman replied: 'I've no smile left. I
work extra hours every day. I'm too tired. I only want to cry.'

FT  05 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Iveco in talks on joint venture with
Nanjing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IVECO, the commercial vehicle subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, is negotiating a
joint venture in China to produce light commercial vehicles with Nanjing
Motor as part of the expansion of its operations in Asia.
Mr Giancarlo Boschetti, Iveco chief executive, said final agreement on the
Chinese venture was expected to be reached in the summer.
Around 6,000 Iveco Daily light commercial vehicles (3-6 tonnes gross vehicle
weight) were produced by Nanjing Motor last year under an existing licensing
deal established in the mid-1980s.
The planned joint venture would raise capacity to around 60,000 vehicles a
year, and local content would be increased from 50 to around 90 per cent.
Iveco would take a minority equity stake in the venture.
Mr Boschetti said Iveco wanted to increase its operations in Asia and was
aiming to use the venture in China as well as Ashok Leyland, its
minority-owned affiliate in India, to export to other parts of the region.
Separately, Iveco has signed a licensing agreement with Halla Engineering
and Heavy Industry in South Korea to produce heavy duty trucks, chiefly for
off-road use in the construction industry, and is planning to assemble a
small volume of light commercial vehicles in a joint venture in Vietnam.
Around 250 Iveco vehicles will be produced in South Korea this year, to rise
to 1,000 a year by 1997.
The group is transferring to India the assembly line for the former UK-built
Iveco Ford Cargo, which has been replaced by the new generation EuroCargo
truck range at the Langley plant west of London.
Output of the Cargo is due to begin in India in November under a four-year
plan to renew the Ashok Leyland product range. Products will be badged Ashok
Iveco.

THE US requires better market access for its agricultural exports to the EC
in order to conclude a Uruguay Round deal, Mr Mike Espy, US agriculture
secretary, said yesterday.
Following meetings in Brussels with Mr Rene Steichen, EC farm commissioner,
and Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, Mr Espy said the issue of
market access was left 'largely unresolved' by last November's EC-US
breakthrough in Washington on farm trade.
He said the administration had no wish to reopen the Washington agreement,
which staved off a transatlantic trade war. But in order to conclude an
agreement under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 'we need better
market access.' He would not be drawn on whether the US was seeking a
managed trade solution, guaranteeing it market share, and merely said
officials from both sides would be looking at the issue of access.
He also said it was 'time-urgent' for the EC to implement the Washington
agreement on oilseeds, hinting that otherwise the powerful US soya industry
would press for the Dollars 1bn sanctions withdrawn last November to be
reinstated.
Mr Steichen emphasised that 'their interpretation is different from ours' on
market access. 'The US wants fixed markets now,' he added, pointing out that
the Uruguay Round final act mentioned only market 'opportunities'.
France yesterday confirmed its desire to obtain some modifications of the EC
negotiating position in the Gatt world trade negotiations and to reopen at
least some points of the agricultural chapter.
Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, said France would shortly send a
memorandum to Britain and Germany setting out its position.

THE Ukrainian government is preparing a decree which would shift trade with
Russia to world prices on July 1, according to Ukrainian officials. If
implemented, the measure would bring a sharp shock to Ukraine's already
faltering economy, but in the long term it would be likely to assist market
reforms in the two neighbouring Slav states.
Mr Ivan Herts, Ukrainian minister for foreign economic relations, said he
had prepared a decree that would oblige Russia to pay world prices for goods
and services, including the transit costs of oil and gas, which it exports
through Ukraine. In exchange, Mr Herts expects Russia to raise the prices it
charges Ukraine for energy to international rates.
The decree will be debated by cabinet on May 10.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Brazilian government is hoping to attract foreign capital to carry out a
massive roadbuilding and repair programme - the first time the country has
allowed private sector participation in the provision of public services.
The programme, which envisages private sector investment of Dollars 1.5bn
(Pounds 974m) in the next three years, will be launched on Monday with
bidding for the maintenance and operation of the Rio-Niteroi bridge, the
14km suspension bridge which links the two sides of Rio de Janeiro, and the
Via Dutra, the 429km road between Rio and Sao Paulo, Brazil's two largest
cities.
Explaining the decision Mr Alberto Goldman, transport minister, said: 'Lack
of investment over the last decade has completely destroyed our road and
rail system, making freight very expensive and affecting our exports. . .
The government has no money so the only answer is through concession.'
Brazil depends unusually heavily on roads, which carry 70 per cent of cargo.
However, less than half of the 50,000km of federal highways are in
reasonable condition. Mr Goldman says Brazil needs to repair 2,000km-3,000km
a year just to prevent the situation worsening, but last year only 1,000km
were repaired.
In his recent economic plan, President Itamar Franco made roads a priority,
doubling investment to 0.6-0.7 per cent of GDP, to repair 6,000km this year
in a project that will create 110,000 jobs. The extra money will come from a
new tax on fuel imports, expected to raise Dollars 600m, with Dollars 300m
from the World Bank.
Mr Goldman says this is 'nowhere near sufficient' and plans to open to
concession 7,500km of roads for repair and maintenance this year.

FT  05 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Oil boom in CIS may attract Dollars 85bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE former Soviet Union is on the verge of a massive foreign investment boom
in the oil, gas and minerals sector, according to the United Nations
Economic Commission for Europe.
It estimates that up to Dollars 85bn (Pounds 55bn) of foreign capital may
flow into the Commonwealth of Independent States as a consequence of deals
signed between 1990 and early 1993.
While this huge inflow will be spread over decades, initial investment over
the next four years could reach almost Dollars 10bn, the ECE believes.
This is double total foreign investment so far in CIS countries in all
industrial sectors combined.
Of the 39 projects identified by the ECE report*, 22 are in Russia and eight
in Kazakhstan. Over half involve American or British companies. The biggest
to date is a deal between British Gas and Agip of Italy with the government
of Kazakhstan, entailing investment of Dollars 6bn during the first 10 years
and up to Dollars 20bn over 40 years.
The ECE notes that most of the projects are in the oil and gas industries.
'There is considerable scope for further large-scale investments in the
CIS's still under-exploited mineral resources sector, including in gold,
copper, coal and aluminium.'
The UN body has also recorded a steady increase in the total number of
foreign investment projects in the CIS and eastern Europe. Total foreign
investment registrations in the former Comecon area more than doubled, from
31,000 at the start of 1992 to 64,200 at the end. In the CIS alone,
registrations trebled from 4,200 to 13,250.
The ECE says foreign investors are increasingly shifting away from
establishment of joint ventures towards buying existing companies or setting
up wholly-owned subsidiaries. In several eastern European countries, over
half the value of total foreign direct investment is now accounted for by
privatisation.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Mandela urges British business to invest in South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, pictured
yesterday, urged British business to invest in South Africa 'as soon as the
date for elections is announced' and promised an early return to
Commonwealth membership, writes Michael Holman. Mr Mandela, on a two-day
visit to London, is due to hold talks today with Mr John Major, Britain's
prime minister, and address members of both houses of parliament. The ANC
expects the constitutional negotiations under way in South Africa will soon
set a date for the country's first all-race elections, paving the way to a
government of national unity. The election itself would follow within a
year. Mr Mandela told a press conference that the ANC had 'issued an
investment code which provides that there will be no expropriation of
property of investors. They will be allowed to repatriate their dividends
and profits, and we think that will go a long way to reassuring investors to
invest in our country'. The ANC leader once again appealed to whites to stay
in South Africa: 'They have the knowledge, the skills . . . without them it
is going to be difficult to address many of the socio-economic problems
facing the country.' An early foreign policy decision of a new government
would be to rejoin the Commonwealth, Mr Mandela said later at a lunch in his
honour hosted by Chief Emeka Anyaoku, Commonwealth secretary-general.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Premadasa leaves legacy of growth: Slain Sri Lankan
president's gains set to live on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of Sri Lankans yesterday stood in line on the beach of Colombo
waiting to enter the waterfront mansion of the assassinated President
Ranasinghe Premadasa to pay their last respects.
Among them were businessmen who wished to honour a man who had done much for
his country's economy. Mr Premadasa presided over rapid liberalisation,
solid economic growth, a sharp rise in share prices and an unprecedented
surge in foreign investment.
Businessmen in Colombo believe Mr Premadasa's economic achievements will
survive his bloody death at the hands of a suicide bomber last weekend. They
think that even though the assassination could bring confusion in politics,
Sri Lanka's economy will survive the shock.
As Mr A S Jaywardena, chairman of Sri Lanka's Securities and Exchange
Commission, says: 'There will be a loss of confidence but it will be
moderate.'
Sri Lankan executives have grown used to doing business amid political
turmoil. For 10 years the country has been split by a civil war in the north
and east in which the Tamil Tigers insurgents are fighting for a separate
homeland for the minority Tamil community against the wishes of the majority
Sinhalese.
However, businessmen do have one concern - that the president's death and
the assassination the previous week of Mr Lalith Athulathmudali, an
opposition leader, might trigger more general violence in the relatively
prosperous south and west of the island.
The danger yesterday seemed remote - Sri Lankans have reacted remarkably
calmly to the president's assassination. But the risk exists: the JVP, a
Singhalese anarchist group, resorted to violence in the late 1980s and was
ruthlessly suppressed at considerable cost to Sri Lanka's international
reputation.
If calm continues to prevail now, much credit will be due to the way in
which the caretaker government, led by Mr D B Wijetunga, the acting
president, and the opposition parties have refrained from inflaming
passions. As a western diplomat said yesterday: 'People are behaving very
well because they know how quickly the situation might slip out of control
if they try to exploit it.'
To businessmen's relief, Mr Wijetunga has also committed himself to carrying
on with Mr Premadasa's economic policies, including deregulation of trade,
financial services, and privatisation. Moreover, there are strong signs that
the opposition leaders would also broadly favour Mr Premadasa's economic
policies if they were to come to power.
The two assassinations have come at a time when businessmen are fairly well
placed to withstand a moderate blow to confidence. The economy has been
growing at an average annual rate of 5 per cent in the last three years,
including 1992 when the rate slipped to 4.3 per cent because of a severe
drought.
Mr Wimal Hettiarachchi, director of economic research at the central bank of
Sri Lanka, expects to see 5 per cent growth this year. 'We hope to see
further progress. Politicians have their differences, but no one wants to
sabotage the national economy.'
Foreign investment, which has grown from USDollars 50m (Pounds 32m) a year
in the mid-1980s to Dollars 200m last year, could suffer from the political
upheavals as those investors who have yet to commit themselves to Sri Lanka
may decide to hold back. Foreign investment in the country largely consists
of small investments in businesses which require little capital - such as
garment-making, shoes and toys.
Tourism, an important earner of foreign exchange for Sri Lanka, is
particularly vulnerable to the effects of violent incidents. Fortunately for
the country's hoteliers, the assassinations have occurred at the end of the
tourist season.
'If this had happened in November, we would be in trouble,' said one Colombo
hotel manager. The industry, which is mainly in the south, has only just
recovered from the effects of the JVP insurgency. The number of tourists in
1992 rose 24 per cent to 394,000 - a level last seen in 1984.
Sri Lanka cannot afford another prolonged period of economic disruption. The
country's high literacy rate of more than 90 per cent is the envy of other
developing nations. But these well-educated people are more likely than
their uneducated peers to demand good jobs. Without jobs, they are more
likely to voice their anger.
As a leading Colombo economist sys: 'Sri Lanka needs to keep growing at
least as fast as it has in the past few years.'

<TEXT>
Hong Kong's governor, Mr Chris Patten, urged the US yesterday to renew
normal trade status for China as a way of promoting further economic and
political reforms there, Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Patten, in a speech at the National Press Club, said both reform in China
and Hong Kong's economy would be hurt if the US withdrew China's
most-favoured-nation trade status or attached tough conditions to its
renewal next year.
President Bill Clinton is expected next month to link MFN renewal for China
to improvements in human rights and curbing weapons proliferation, among
other things. During last year's campaign, Mr Clinton repeatedly urged such
conditions, attacking then-president George Bush for 'coddling' China's
rulers.

In 1987 the Singapore government cut the Asian Journal's circulation to 400
copies a day after accusing it of interfering in domestic politics.
Subsequently the government has raised the permitted circulation to 3,500
copies daily.
Asian Journal correspondents have only been allowed into Singapore for brief
visits in the last two years.
'We continue to hope the government will soon allow the market, not
government permit, to determine our sales,' the Journal said.

<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S current account deficit rose sharply to ADollars 2.13bn (Pounds
960m) on a seasonally adjusted basis in March, more than double the February
deficit of ADollars 861m.
Imports surged, mainly because of an increase in machinery imports and the
payment for a natural gas tanker.
The figures have dented market expectations of another drop in interest
rates by the middle of this year. Favourable growth and inflation figures
during the December quarter had allowed the government to cut interest rates
by a half point last month.
The government is taking comfort in the import figures, saying a rise in
machinery imports in March indicates that business investment is steadily
recovering. The tanker purchase will also help raise exports of natural gas,
especially to Japan.
Nevertheless, analysts now expect an extremely weak recovery.

Mr Haruyuki Takada, 33, was confirmed dead. Three other Japanese and at
least five Dutch Marine commandos were wounded in the ambush, which a UN
official in Phnom Penh blamed on Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
The Khmer Rouge, which has refused to abide by a peace pact it and other
warring factions signed in October 1991, has vowed to disrupt elections
scheduled for May 23-28. They killed four Bulgarian peacekeepers in two
attacks last month.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN chief in Cambodia, travelled to Beijing yesterday
to meet Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodian head of state, about the
deteriorating security. The two are to attend a meeting tomorrow with
representatives of Cambodia's four factions in the hope of ending the
bloodshed. Mr Akashi, who is Japanese, is to discuss the attack with Prince
Sihanouk. The prince yesterday appealed to the warring factions to work for
peace.
In Tokyo Mr Yohei Kono, the chief cabinet secretary, said Japan had an
important international responsibility as part of the UN operation in
Cambodia, but the government was under increasing opposition pressure to
recall the personnel.
'This incident is clearly a challenge to the UN peacekeeping forces and we
cannot allow it,' Mr Kono said. He and other Japanese leaders returned home
early from their Golden Week holidays after learning of the attack.
Japan's Social Democratic party, the largest opposition party, called for
the immediate return of the personnel, arguing that the intensified Khmer
Rouge guerrilla attacks mean that Cambodia no longer fits the guidelines for
a Japanese peacekeeping operation. Under the guidelines, set after more than
a year of public debate, Japanese personnel should not be despatched if a
ceasefire agreement collapses.
Most of the 600 Japanese military personnel are engaged in transport work,
while 75 police officers assist with traffic control. The National Police
Agency requested the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia to 'take further
measures to ensure the safety of our members'.

US PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is considering calling a personal meeting with the
heads of the Arab and Israeli negotiating teams in Washington shortly in a
renewed American effort to breathe life into the Middle East peace process.
Mr Farouk al-Shara, Syrian foreign minister, said in Damascus yesterday this
indicated the importance that the US attached to the peace efforts.
Earlier Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, had damped down hopes of
quick progress in the ninth round of the talks and warned that negotiations
could 'blow up' if references to the final status of the occupied Arab
territories was put on the agenda.
His remarks were primarily directed at Mr Shimon Peres, his foreign
minister, who on Sunday said Israel faced a decisive two weeks of
negotiations and called for the pace of the talks to be accelerated.
Mr Peres, a long-time rival of Mr Rabin within Israel's Labour party, said
he favoured an eventual confederation between Jordan, the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip.
Mr Rabin, in an Israeli newspaper interview, retorted that the only way to
complete negotiations quickly would be by giving the other side everything
that they demanded. 'I do not intend to do that,' he said. The prime
minister also ruled out Mr Peres's proposals on confederation saying that
meant conceding a Palestinian state.
As the negotiations entered the second week of the present session, Israel
and Syria appeared deadlocked over the core issue of the 'full peace' which
would follow a 'full withdrawal' from the occupied Golan Heights. Israel is
insisting that Syria must specify in detail what it means by a 'full peace'
before it will indicate how much of the Golan it will return. Mr Rabin
insisted yesterday the onus was on Syria to break the impasse.
The lack of progress achieved in any of the sets of talks, which also
include Lebanon and Jordan, appear to have dashed earlier US hopes that all
the delegations might agree to remain in Washington for an extended period.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Handling of Israeli banks sale criticised
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S state comptroller yesterday published a highly critical report of
the government's handling of the sale of shares in the country's banks,
which it took over 10 years ago following a share manipulation scandal.
The comptroller's report said that rather than protect the public interest
and minimise its losses, the government was prepared to make concessions to
the former owners, thereby serving their interest in regaining control of
the banks.
The government allowed the former owners to take part in formulating policy
concerning the sale of the banks and was willing to give them preferential
terms in bidding for a controlling stake, it said.
The former owners retained majority voting rights, and the report notes that
the Treasury gave former owners who agreed to the equalisation of the banks'
shares a bonus in the form of 3 per cent of the capital.
According to the report, the government's willingness to allow the former
owners to be involved in the banks' privatisation has been a main reason
behind the prolonged delay in selling of the institutions.
'It was clear in advance that these people saw themselves as candidates to
reacquire control, when the government put the shares up for sale,' said the
report. 'This created a blatant contradiction between the aims of the
government and the effective owner interested in selling the banks under the
best possible terms, and the aims of the bank managers and former owners.'
The report was published two days after the cabinet approved a
reorganisation programme for Israel's four leading banks, presented by
Finance Minister Avraham Shohat. The programme will force the big banks,
which control more than 86 per cent of banking activity in the country, to
sell off some of their smaller banking subsidiaries and their holdings in
non-banking companies.
Since taking over the banks in 1983, the government has not yet sold off
shares in any of the big four - Leumi, Hapoalim, Israel Discount and
Mizrahi.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kimimasa Tarumizu, president of the Asian Development Bank, yesterday
defended the bank's record in the face of US reluctance to subscribe to a
proposed capital increase and said new funds were needed to alleviate
poverty, preserve the environment and finance investment in infrastructure.
Addressing the opening session of the ADB's annual meeting, Mr Tarumizu said
the bank expected to raise about Dollars 14bn (Pounds 8.9bn) on
international financial markets over the next four years to finance its
loans to developing Asian countries. The ADB's borrowings rose to Dollars
3.1bn last year from Dollars 1.3bn in 1991.
The ADB wants to double its subscribed capital from the present Dollars
23bn, both to secure its future borrowings on international markets and
because its charter limits the amount it can lend to the sum of its capital
and reserves.
US representatives have suggested a reinterpretation of the charter to allow
further lending without the capital increase, arguing that the limit should
be on loan disbursements rather than commitments.
But if the existing interpretation is accepted - and the ADB insists that it
should be - the bank will probably have to stop granting new loans some time
in 1994, unless they are covered by incoming repayments of previous credits.
Mr Tarumizu yesterday described an early consensus on the capital increase
as 'critical'.
Responding to concerns about the rising failure rate of ADB projects, he
said measures had been taken and 'task forces' established to increase the
effectiveness of the bank's assistance.
He said the ADB needed resources because it was expanding - the six former
central Asian republics of the Soviet Union are expected to join soon,
although they are also members of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development - and because further outside support for economic reform in
Asia was essential despite the success of many Asian economies.
'The overwhelming majority of the world's poor - and the extremely poor -
still live in Asia, almost entirely in the bank's member countries,' he
said.
At one point Mr Tarumizu emphasised the need to tackle Asian infrastructure
problems such as power shortages, particularly severe in the Philippines
where the ADB annual meeting is being held; as if on cue, the lights in the
convention centre went out.

FT  05 MAY 93 / New group targets the roots of corruption: Michael Holman
examines an attempt to fight the scourge of the developing world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CAMPAIGN to fight corrupt business practices around the world may seem the
contemporary equivalent of cleaning the Augean stables. An attempt to do
just that gets under way in Berlin today.
A gathering of some 70 businessmen, specialists, and senior officials from
development agencies and governments rich and poor are preparing for the
official launch of Transparency International - 'an international coalition
against corruption in international business transactions.'
This objective may seem optimistic, to say the least. But its founders are
confident that it is an idea whose time has come. The concepts of good
governance and accountability have unprecedented international support, as
relevant to exposing corruption in Brazil or Italy as in Zaire or Nigeria.
Behind the project, nearly two years in gestation, is a group of hard-headed
veterans of aid, commerce and development, eminent in their own fields, and
with experience spanning the developing world.
Among those playing an active role in the Berlin launch is Mr Robert
McNamara, the former World Bank president, while the names of a
distinguished 30-member advisory council are due to be announced this week.
They are expected to include Mr Oscar Arias, former president of Costa Rica
and Nobel prize winner, Mr Andy Young, a former US ambassador to the UN, and
Mr Haartmut Ruppel, Namibia's attorney general.
All share concern about the impact of corruption, generally agreed to have
increased dramatically over the past decade. 'Nobody in the business world
pretends any more that corruption is not one of the most important and
damaging factors in third world development,' says a businessman and adviser
to TI, who has drawn from his experience in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean.
The damage to third world economies, he points out, goes beyond the fact
that the wrong supplier or contractor might be chosen. 'When a government is
persuaded - that is bribed - that it needs aircraft or a food processing
plant which are unnecessary or unjustified, not only is there a loss of
scarce foreign exchange resources. Those resources will have been diverted
from worthwhile projects.'
Mr Peter Eigen, a former senior World Bank official and interim chairman of
TI, has no illusions about the immensity of the task, which embraces former
communist states as well as third world countries.
'We recognise the realities of international commerce and competition,' says
Mr Eigen, who in the 1980s served as the World Bank resident representative
for east Africa, based in Nairobi: 'Our approach must be evolutionary.'
At the heart of the campaign will be the drive to win support for a code of
conduct.
Governments, lending and aid-granting agencies and companies will be invited
to subscribe to the code, central to which is a pledge not to offer or
accept bribes.
What may help make the code effective is the quid pro quo tactic TI will
employ. 'Initially there may be only a few countries where business and
government abide by our code, a few 'islands of integrity',' as Mr Eigen
puts it.
The campaign will therefore focus at the start on five or six governments in
developing countries and eastern Europe who are prepared to support the
code.
These governments - some have already had discussions with TI - will
restrict tendering for state contracts to corporations who have themselves
signed the pledge.
'We expect these leading countries will create a momentum by their example,'
says Mr Eigen.
Apart from seeking support for honest business practices, TI will offer a
range of services, helping to strengthen rules and systems for international
procurement bidding to help eradicate corruption, or assisting governments
to establish anti-corruption investigative agencies, providing a clearing
house for information on corruption, and examining serious contraventions of
the code.
TI may be optimistic, but it is certainly not nave. It would be invidious to
suggest that some of TI's supporters in the business community are poachers
turned gamekeepers, but a 50-page analysis of corruption by one of the
founders displays considerable insights into the world of contracts and
kickbacks.
Top of the contract kickback list are aircraft, ships, military supplies and
telecommunications, followed by big industrial and agro-industrial projects.
Then come dams, bridges, airports and hospitals, and bulk supplies - oil,
cement, fertiliser.
As a rule of thumb, 5 per cent of Dollars 200,000 will win the help of a
senior official below top rank. The same percentage of Dollars 2m and you
are dealing with the permanent secretary.
At Dollars 20m enter the minister and senior staff, while a cut from Dollars
200m 'justifies the serious attention of the head of state.'
Suggestions that existing safeguards against corruption are effective, such
as international competitive bidding, or pre-shipment inspection are
dismissed: 'The short answer is that with complicity between buyer and
seller they are largely ineffective.'

FT  05 MAY 93 / Clinton plans to shake up White House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton admitted yesterday that he was thinking of shaking up
his White House staff 'to get our priorities straight'.
Responding to a new round of speculation, he said he expected to name new
deputies to his chief of staff, Mr Thomas 'Mack' McLarty, the president's
kindergarten friend and former Arkansas utilities executive.
'We think there needs to be a little tighter co-ordination to make sure
we've got our priorities straight and that those priorities are communicated
all the way down to the staff,' he said, noting that Mr McLarty currently
has only one deputy.
His administration has come under fire for having lost its focus, a
criticism Mr Clinton conceded when he spoke of the difficulties of 'trying
to get a lot of things going in a hurry and having people work very, very
hard but maybe getting a little out of focus'.
Of particular concern has been a series of leaks about the likely scope and
cost of the health care package expected to be unveiled this month. In
general the young White House staff, while bubbling with ideas, has rarely
presented a consistent, co-ordinated front.
Mr McLarty is new to Washington and seems to conceive his job mostly as an
adviser to the president, especially on appointments to senior positions,
rather than as a political strategist or internal disciplinarian.
Mr Clinton's implication is that he is thinking of naming an experienced
political operative to assist his White House chief.
A clear prime need is to improve relations with Congress now that the vital
budget bill has begun its legislative passage. Mr Clinton can ill afford
further setbacks such as that which befell his stimulus package last month.
Other changes in view could include Mr George Stephanopoulos, the
communications director, becoming more involved in policy and less in his
frequently confrontational daily press briefings.
Ms Dee Dee Myers, the press secretary, is generally conceded to have a
lighter touch, though she is known to have much less direct access to the
president and to other leading policy makers.
However, the first Reagan White House, widely considered effective, was
notable for its strong chief of staff (Mr James Baker, later secretary of
treasury and state) and for the doling out by the press secretaries of a
minimalist but artfully presented diet of information to the media.

MEXICO'S former minister of communications and transport, Mr Andres Caso
Lombardo, says he has turned down an offer to become his country's
ambassador to the UK, to defend himself against accusations of libel brought
by British subject and former IBM agent Mr Kaveh Moussavi.
Mr Caso Lombardo, minister until March this year, said he would not take up
a position in the foreign service, so as to 'have absolutely all the freedom
to defend myself' against Mr Moussavi's accusations.
A writ against Mr Caso Lombardo for libel and slander was issued in London
on Friday on behalf of Mr Moussavi, who has engaged the services of libel
specialists Peter Carter-Ruck and Partners.
Mr Moussavi claims that Mr Caso Lombardo defamed him in giving his response
to allegations made by Mr Moussavi earlier this year.
Mr Moussavi had said three officials from the Mexican government had
solicited a bribe of Dollars 1m (Pounds 650,000) in return for fixing a
controversial Dollars 21m air traffic control contract.

<TEXT>
THE promotion of economic reform, trade, democracy and human rights will be
the cornerstones of US policy towards both Latin America and Africa,
according to two speeches delivered this week by senior members of the
Clinton administration.
On Latin America, Mr Clifton Wharton, the deputy secretary of state, engaged
in few specifics, but said that the US had no intention of trying to
overthrow President Fidel Castro of Cuba but hoped the Cuban people would be
able to win their freedom through 'peaceful transition'.
He endorsed the controversial Cuban Democracy Act, which curbs commercial
links with Cuba, as part of a twin-track policy - refusing 'support for the
Castro dictatorship' while simultaneously opening a door to Cuba to rejoin
'the democratic community'. Soon, he predicted, the Cuban government will no
longer be able to 'defy political gravity'.
Mr Wharton argued that the North American Free Trade Area 'is in the
over-riding economic and foreign policy interest' of the US. Restoring
democracy in Haiti was also a priority.
On Africa, Mr Anthony Lake, the White House national security adviser, took
comfort in the trend towards multi-party elections on the continent. He
pledged an activist approach to 'disasters in the making', such as Somalia,
and to resolution of conflicts in Zaire, Sudan, Liberia and Togo.
Both speeches represent the first attempts by the administration to place
the respective continental policies in a conceptual framework.
The Latin America policy statement marks a departure from the attitudes of
President Ronald Reagan, consumed by the need to fight communist
insurgencies, and of President George Bush, often dominated by the need to
combat the narcotics trade.
Many of its sentiments resemble the policies of the Carter administration.
Mr Wharton also specifically praised the leadership of Presidents Salinas of
Mexico, Menem of Argentina and Aylwin of Chile for liberating economic
capabilities.
Mr Lake said the new administration not only knows 'where Africa is' but
intends to contribute to 'where it is going'.
He admitted that, with hindsight, 'we should have acted more aggressively'
in the aftermath of the elections in Angola, presumably to ensure acceptance
by Mr Jonas Savimbi's Unita movement.
He said that the US, working with France and Belgium, had made it clear to
President Mobutu of Zaire that 'we support the democratic process.'

THE United Mine Workers union is threatening strike action at the US's
largest coal mines, in a stand-off over job security, reports Laurie Morse
from Chicago.
Mr Jim Grossfeld of the union said miners worked without a contract
yesterday after a contract extension expired at midnight on Monday. Owners,
represented by the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, met union
officials on Monday, with federal mediators. No more meetings were scheduled
yesterday, Mr Grossfeld said.
'The story is, barring a settlement, every mine of every BCOA operator
becomes a strike target,' he added.
The BCOA is refusing to guarantee in a new national contract that its
members will employ union workers at their new mines. As older coal mines
shut and new ones open with non-union labour, the United Mine Workers has
been losing its support base.
The union targeted Peabody Coal, a subsidiary of Hanson of the UK, for a
strike on February 2 when the national contract first expired. The strike
ended and negotiations resumed on March 2.

AT LEAST 11 people died and more than 60 were hurt in floods and mudslides
which swept through parts of the Chilean capital, police said yesterday,
Reuter reports from Santiago.
Heavy rain in the Andes mountains swelled rivers and burst canal banks on
Monday, burying parts of poorer southern neighbourhoods of Santiago under
mud and water.
Radio reports said the death toll could be 14 or higher after more bodies
were found in the mud yesterday morning.
Police and civil defence workers with earth-moving machinery struggled to
clear away mud and debris. More than 1,700 people were temporarily given

FT  05 MAY 93 / Paraguayans have first free say in 182 years: The Election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTIONS in Paraguay used to have only one serious contender. General
Alfredo Stroessner ruled Paraguay with an iron fist for 35 years but was
ritually 're-elected' in polls that were neither free nor fair.
The Stroessner era ended in 1989 when his former right-hand man, General
Andres Rodriguez, toppled him in a military coup. To the surprise of many,
Gen Rodriguez has kept his promise of bringing democracy to Paraguay - a
country ruled by generals and dictators since independence from Spain in
1811.
Mr Rodriguez promises that the general election on Sunday will be free and
fair. He was himself confirmed in power in a reasonably clean snap election
months after the 1989 coup. Mr Rodriguez, who is constitutionally barred
from standing, has repeatedly stated in public that he will respect the
result of the election for president and for congress, even if the
opposition wins.
The likelihood of an opposition victory is less remote than once seemed
possible. The formidable electoral machine of the Colorado party - which,
together with the army, has run Paraguay for almost 50 years - is split and
demoralised.
Its lacklustre candidate for president, Mr Juan Carlos Wasmosy, is lagging
in the polls. Mr Luis Maria Argana, his opponent in a bitter primary
election, is calling on voters to back any candidate rather than Mr Wasmosy.
Furthermore, an unending stream of reports in the unshackled press about
political repression during the Stroessner years and corruption under Mr
Rodriguez has further darkened the reputation of the Colorados and the
military.
Opinion polls put two opposition candidates in the lead. Mr Domingo Laino,
veteran opponent of the Stroessner regime and candidate of the Authentic
Liberal Radical party is running neck and neck with Mr Guillermo Caballero
Vargas, an independent pro-business candidate of Encuentro Nacional, a
coalition grouping.
None of the three leading candidates would be expected to make any radical
policy shifts. Mr Wasmosy pledges continuity. Mr Caballero would take a more
pro-business line. Mr Laino wisely promises to avoid antagonising the armed
forces.
The government has not been helped by a mixed economic record. Despite its
free-market policies, last year the economy grew only 1.7 per cent. This
year things are looking up, with stronger export prices and forecasts of 4
per cent growth.
All this has not gone down well with the armed forces or the Colorado party.
Gen Lino Oviedo, commander of the 1st army corps, which is strategically
based in the capital, Asuncion, said the armed forces would 'co-govern'
Paraguay with the Colorados forever - a view publicly shared by other top
officers. But on Saturday Mr Laino attracted 200,000 people to a rally in
Asuncion, which analysts see as an eloquent public rebuke to the military.
There is also widespread belief that the Colorados could simply rig the
elections. Or they could use their majority in congress - which will have
the last word in disputes over the elections' outcome - to maintain their
hold on power. If all else fails, the army could intervene.
But it will be harder to get away with dirty tricks than before.
International observers will be vigilant. Argentina and Brazil - Paraguay's
two powerful neighbours - say they will not tolerate a return to the past.
US President Bill Clinton has told Mr Rodriguez he trusts the elections
would be free and fair and would proceed as scheduled.
The US has had a crucial role in coaxing Paraguay towards democracy, as it
had in keeping Mr Stroessner in power. That is why level heads in Asuncion
are confident that Mr Rodriguez will be as good as his word and turn over
power to a legitimately elected successor - for the first time in 182 years.
It is another question whether an opposition leader can govern without the
backing of the military, still the arbiters of power in Paraguay.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Athens joins Belgrade to put pressure on Bosnian Serbs
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SERBIAN and Greek leaders will go to Pale today to exert pressure on the
Bosnian Serb assembly to ratify the international peace plan for Bosnia.
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the
Greek prime minister, are expected to warn Bosnian Serbs of the tough
consequences of failing to back the plan.
Deputies from all Serb areas in Bosnia were yesterday heading to Pale, near
Sarajevo, for the meeting, which has been called to decide whether to back
the plan signed begrudgingly by their leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, in Athens
at the weekend.
Mr Mitsotakis, leader of a country that has been a traditional ally of
Orthodox Serbia, will stress the military punishment that awaits the Bosnian
Serbs from the international community if they reject the plan.
Mr Milosevic will add his muscle to the world's persuasive powers by making
clear he is prepared to cut their supply lines from Serbia unless they
co-operate.
Even so, hardline deputies last night threatened to overrule Mr Karadzic's
approval of the peace settlement, amid protests about 'international
dictates'.
Mr Milosevic put pressure on Mr Karadzic to change his mind and sign the
peace plan, drawn up by the international mediators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord
Owen.
Mr Karadzic, who has staked his future on today's vote, yesterday appealed
for peace and Serbian unity, calling on deputies to approve the plan, which
divides Bosnia into ten provinces broadly on ethnic lines.
Even Mr Zeljko Raznatovic, a parliamentary deputy in Belgrade, who is better
known as Arkan, commander of a fierce paramilitary group, has swung into
line behind Mr Milosevic. Mr Raznatovic called for 'peace and for the vote
to be taken seriously'.
But the show of force from Belgrade has not cowed the Bosnian Serb deputies,
described by Mr Karadzic as 'true representatives' of the Serbian people.
'These are people who are coming directly from trenches, each and every one
of them has lost somebody,' he said.
In a thinly veiled reference to Mr Milosevic, hardline deputies yesterday
warned that Bosnian Serbs were fighting for Serbia as well. Serb leaders
over the past year have repeatedly claimed they are defending their land
against a Moslem threat.
'We are fighting for Serbia more than we are for ourselves, Belgrade should
realise this,' said Mr Radoslav Brdjanin, a key hardline deputy from Banja
Luka, the Serb stronghold in north-west Bosnia.
'I think we should prepare for defence and unite,' he told Serbian radio in
Pale, the Serb mountain stronghold just 14 miles from Sarajevo, the besieged
Bosnian capital.
Many deputies appeared to believe the peace plan would be approved so as to
avert military intervention. But they did not believe that approval would
mean that the plan would be carried out.
'The signature is important for world diplomacy,' said Mr Bozidar Vucurevic,
a lorry driver who has become a key leader of eastern Hercegovina. 'It is
only a temporary solution until the state of Bosnia finally disappears.'
The plan envisages the Serbs handing over a large amount of territory which
they seized from Moslems since fighting erupted more than a year ago.
But Serb leaders seem to believe that even if the plan is approved, the
status quo will not change.
Mr Dragan Spasojevic, from Zvornik, which under the Vance-Owen plan is
designated as Moslem, said: 'Serbian territory not designated as Serbian in
the plan remains 'factually' the same for at least 18 months.'
Deputies yesterday drove to Pale in luxury cars, some bearing number plates
from cities under Moslem or Croat control.
They sped past Moslem houses still ablaze around the fallen eastern enclave
of Konjevic Polje as Bosnian Serb forces watched.
Trenches have been cut there through unploughed fields. Mosques lay in
ruins, bearing testimony to the Serb onslaught on eastern Bosnia.
A young Serb carrying a rifle in a tractor said: 'This place will never be
Moslem. My brother lies in that grave there.'

<TEXT>
Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Italy's prime minister, yesterday named four new
ministers in his cabinet, writes Robert Graham. They replace ministers
withdrawn by their parties in protest at the blocking by parliament of
attempts to have Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, answer
corruption charges.
The environment portfolio, vacated by the Greens, was given to Mr Valdo
Spini, a Socialist deputy who briefly held the same post in the outgoing
Amato government.
The posts of finance, science and relations with parliament, held by members
of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), went
respectively to Prof Franco Gallo, an economist, Prof Umberto Colombo, a
distinguished scientist and head of the research institute Enea, and Prof
Paolo Barile, who has switched from minister without portfolio. Mr Livio
Paladin, a judge and former minister of regional affairs, is to be put in
charge of relations with the European Community.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Anger at criticism of Ilva proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S new industry minister yesterday reacted angrily to a critical
European Commission analysis of the restructuring plan prepared for Ilva,
the loss-making state-controlled steel producer.
Mr Paolo Savona told fellow EC industry ministers that Brussels seemed
prejudiced against a plan which had only been submitted on Friday.
His call for more sympathetic treatment was backed by Mr Claudio Aranzadi,
the Spanish minister, whose plans for restructuring of the Spanish steel
industry have still not won Commission approval.
Yesterday's stand-off was probably only a foretaste of the fierce debate to
come in July, when ministers will have to decide unanimously on the fate of
both state subsidy plans. They will also vote then on German proposals -
rejected by Brussels - for rescuing east German producer Ekostahl.
Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, warned yesterday that Brussels
would stick to a consistent and tough line on state subsidies to national
steelmakers, to avoid undermining the overall plan for supporting the
industry.
He estimated that the new Ilva plan would involve the payment of some Ecu4bn
(Pounds 3.2bn) in state aids, mainly relating to the write-off of an
estimated L8,500bn (Pounds 3.6bn) of debt. Subsidies on such a scale would
have to be offset by capacity cuts of up to 3m tonnes.
IRI, the Italian state holding company which controls Ilva, argues that the
new plan involves no state aid, and that the 'new' steel company it plans to
create should not be subject to production cuts.

<TEXT>
BUSINESS confidence in France has deteriorated since the start of the year,
according to Insee, the state statistics institute.
The new centre-right government had hoped recent interest rate cuts might
encourage investment. But the Insee survey suggests industrialists will
lower investment by a further 9 per cent this year, following last year's 10
per cent cut.
Reductions are expected to be deepest in the motor industry, which yesterday
reported a 14.2 per cent fall in output in the first quarter, and a 16.4 per
cent drop in exports. The consumer goods sector is also expected to be badly
hit.
First-quarter growth figures, due soon, are expected to show a real decline
in GDP - the second successive quarter of negative growth.
The state-controlled Banque Nationale de Paris yesterday predicted
negligible growth for the full year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Franz Steinkuhler, head of IG Metall, Germany's powerful engineering
union, yesterday vowed to intensify strike action in east Germany if
employers do not reinstate a previously agreed contract.
'We do not want eastern German workers to remain poor, a mezzogiorno,' he
told the FT. 'We do not want the employers to break the tradition of
collective wage bargaining in east Germany, and then later in west Germany.'
Earlier this year employers cancelled the March 1991 contract with the union
which would have equalised eastern and western wages by 1994. They did so
because of recession in western Germany and low productivity in the east,
which in the metal, engineering and steel sector, is lagging behind western
Germany by about 70 per cent.
'There are some industries - take Opel, the new car plant, for example  -
which have higher productivity than in the west. But the issue is not an
economic one,' said Mr Steinkuhler. 'It is a political one. We need an
industrial policy for the region.'
Mr Steinkuhler dismissed the argument that a low wage economy might in fact
help make the eastern German economy competitive through attracting more
investment.
'And what would low wages do? The younger generation and skilled workers
would migrate westwards. Stemming migration was one of the reasons why we
signed the contract in 1991. Thousands of people were leaving each month. We
cannot allow that to happen again,' he said.
In any case, the dapper union leader explained, this year's pay rises of 26
per cent for metal and engineering, and 21 per cent for the steel,
calculated on western German wages levels for 1992, do not take into account
the fact that working hours are longer, holidays shorter, and benefits fewer
in eastern Germany.
Eastern wages, in reality, are 60 per cent of western German levels. 'Why
should they pay west German prices with east German wages,' he asked.
Mr Steinkuhler is on a 'whistle-stop' tour of the five east German states to
coincide with the first official strikes held in the region since 1933.
Yesterday he told stevedores in Rostock that they had the freedom to strike
and defend their rights. The last time they tried was in 1931. Two years
later Hitler banned all strikes, and the communists followed suit when they
assumed power.
Despite the subdued response to the strikes, Mr Steinkuhler said he was
prepared to ballot, on May 10, the metal and electrical workers in the three
remaining states of Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Berlin-Brandenburg.
But he added, if some enterprises pay wage increases as agreed in the
contract, he will ask these factories to sign individual contracts with the
union. Other officials hinted the union might be prepared to postpone the
timetable to income parity but in no way would this year's wage increases be
compromised.
Whatever the outcome, Mr Steinkuhler is convinced workers in eastern Germany
will no longer be afraid to strike.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Fazio to head Bank of Italy: Appointment breaks tradition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE governing board of the Bank of Italy yesterday broke with tradition by
naming Mr Antonio Fazio, the deputy director-general, to take over as
governor from Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who last Monday agreed to become
prime minister.
The prestigious post to head the central bank, with authority to act
independently, has been assumed throughout the post-war era by the
director-general. However, Mr Lamberto Dini, aged 62, director-general since
1979, has been passed over in favour of the 56-year-old Mr Fazio, number
three in the bank's hierarchy.
Mr Dini will continue in his present role at least until the new bank's
four-man directorate is made known, probably before the governor's annual
statement on May 31. Authorities might well seek a prestigious international
posting for Mr Dini, who in 1986 was considered as a possible successor to
Mr Jacques de Larosiere to head the IMF.
The choice of Mr Fazio, the bank's most outstanding economist, was welcomed
by most political parties. His appointment must be approved by President
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and the cabinet.
However, Mr Ciampi had a clear hand in his successor's appointment and the
former governor is understood to have co-ordinated closely with the
president on the matter. Although Mr Ciampi has long worked closely with Mr
Dini, their approach has never been in complete harmony.
By pressing to have a successor chosen so quickly, Mr Ciampi has signalled
that he has no intention of merely keeping the governor's seat warm while he
heads a brief transitional government. Instead this non-parliamentarian
called on to be prime minister has shown he intends to make a clear division
between this role and an independent Bank of Italy.
The 72-year-old former governor had held the post since 1979 and had made it
known he was anxious to retire. He even offered to resign last September
during the currency crisis.
Moves by Mr Giuliano Amato, the former prime minister, to find a replacement
were blocked by the Christian Democrats who feared Mr Dini was being passed
by.
Mr Fazio, a devout catholic, studied at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology under such illustrious figures as Modigliani and Samuelson.
Considered a moderate Keynesian, his career has been inside the bank since
1963. He was responsible for drawing up the bank's first econometric model
and is a strong intellectual force within the bank.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Socialist leader urges new left-wing party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BREAK and realignment of Italy's traditional political parties was taken
a step further yesterday by the appeal from Mr Giorgio Benvenuto, the
Socialist leader, to create a new left-wing party with a fresh symbol.
In a special meeting of the party leadership, Mr Benvenuto said he would
resign if his proposals were not accepted. Mr Benvenuto was brought in to
head the 100-year-old Socialist party as a compromise candidate when Mr
Bettino Craxi was forced to resign in February after being involved in
corruption scandals.
The proposal to reshape the party and shake off the publicly discredited
image accumulated by years of abuse of power follows similar proposals from
Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the Christian Democrat leader. The former Italian
Communist party changed its name to the Party of the Democratic Left two
years ago.
Mr Benvenuto has felt obliged to act hurriedly after the wave of protest
directed against the party following the majority decision in parliament to
block last week four requests by Milan magistrates to waive Mr Craxi's
immunity to face corruption charges.
In the wake of this decision a number of prominent party members including
Mr Giorgio Ruffolo, a former environment minister, announced they were
resigning. Indeed, since the onset of the corruption scandals last year, the
party has suffered a steady loss of members both at the top and among the
grass roots.
The latter has been of particular concern as the party draws up lists for
municipal elections in June. Officials from a number of big cities have
warned that the party, which won 14 per cent of the national vote last year,
risks being wiped out unless it changes its name and symbol.
Yesterday Mr Benvenuto called for a constituent assembly in June and
demanded all those in the party under investigation for corruption (over 60)
should step down. He also insisted the party in parliament approve immunity
to be waived in all cases where members were involved in demands by
magistrates to investigate corruption.
Of his broader aim he said: 'The object is to form as soon as possible - in
other words, before the next general elections - a new socialist grouping
within a broad realignment of the left which can present itself to run the
country.'

FT  05 MAY 93 / Bundesbank rates policy criticised: Leading institutes see
economic pick-up in last quarter of 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIX leading economic institutes in Germany yesterday sharply criticised
the Bundesbank for failing to cut its interest rates quickly and sharply
enough to ease the recession in the German economy.
In spite of a gloomy forecast of negative growth in the west German economy,
of -2 per cent this year and -1.5 per cent for the whole country, the spring
report of the institutes suggests that a pick-up in the economy will start
in the last quarter of the year. That depends on the central bank continuing
to reduce its interest rates steadily through the year.
The German government also comes in for sharp criticism in its financial
policy, for excessive increases in the tax burden planned for the coming
years, and an inadequate effort to reduce public spending in the west to
finance transfers to east Germany.
The trade union battle for rapid wage equalisation between east Germany and
the west, for which thousands of steel and engineering workers launched a
strike this week, was described as 'drastically mistaken.'
Overall, however, the economists, including in their ranks for the first
time the institute for economic research in Halle, eastern Germany,
cautioned against excessive pessimism over the state of the economy. They
agreed that the German economy is now clearly in a recession, but that it is
close to its lowest point.
Causes of the sharp downturn were delays in reducing interest rates by the
central bank, and uncertainty caused by the prolonged negotiations between
the government, opposition, the 16 states, employers and trade unions, on a
'solidarity pact' for east Germany.
An end to the fall in investment in equipment is in sight, thanks to
declining interest rates and the probability of gradually recovering demand.
There will nonetheless be a clear worsening in unemployment, with the
average level reaching 3.55m during the year, compared with 2.98m in 1992.
The prime objective of economic policy must now be a rapid end to recession
in west Germany, which would otherwise endanger the tentative recovery in
the eastern economy, they say. This inevitably means an increase in public
sector budget deficits in the near term, although last year the deficit was
reduced from 3.2 per cent of gross national product in 1991 to 2.8 per cent.
Financial transfers to east Germany by public sector bodies, including
social security, are expected to reach DM170bn (Pounds 68bn) in 1993,
compared with DM156.2bn last year.
West German industrial output declined again by 0.5 per cent in March,
compared with the previous month, the economics ministry reported yesterday.
The two-month total for February and March was down 10.7 per cent compared
with the same period in 1992.
Worst hit was the output of investment goods, down 15.9 per cent
year-on-year, and manufacturing industry as a whole, down 12 per cent.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Sanctions watch on Danube dances to old-world tempo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
'THEY HAVE no lamps, they have nothing. There is just one screwdriver which
must be 50 years old. I told them they could send it to a museum,' says Mr
Jens Bakkensen, EC observer at the Hungarian river port of Mohacs.
The customs post itself has the air of a museum piece.
Baked in the unseasonally hot sun, it looks like nothing has happened in the
four centuries since an invading Turkish army destroyed the Hungarian king
and nobility at a battle near the spot in the 16th century.
In April, 200 shipments passed through, but the flow has almost dried up. In
the first few day of May, it has been reduced to one shipment a day.
With only one uniform each, customs officers on the Danube upstream of
Serbia prefer not to root around in holds to enforce western sanctions. The
EC's sanctions assistance mission is waiting for a truck from Britain to
deliver overalls and basic equipment.
In the meantime, the Hungarians are without work-clothes, torches, long rods
with which to prod piles of grain, and even screwdrivers.
Nor do the Hungarian authorities possess armed patrol boats.
What if a ship was determined to cross into Serbia and ignored the little
'stop' sign at the river bank? It has never yet happened, the Hungarians
answer.
Even so, the Hungarian government is reluctant to accept the West European
Union's offer of patrol boats.
Budapest is also dragging its heels on implementing the latest UN resolution
tightening up transit through Serbia.
Next door, on a riverside restaurant terrace, boatmen, customs officers and
EC monitors take a break to eat the local spicy fish soup and drink a glass
of wine or something stronger.
The same laid-back spirit infects customs inspections. Hungarian officers -
after a break for lunch - began to search the Zvezdnyy, the Ukrainian boat's
six attendant barges and the cargo of steel for the Mideast and Austrian
wheat for Uzbekistan.
On one of the Zvezdnyy's barges the Hungarians test whether rolls of steel
coil are genuine by picking up iron pellets left over from a previous trip,
dropping them against the giant cylinders below in the hold and listening to
the tone of the clang.
What sanctions violations have been discovered are exports from Serbia
rather than imports into the country. The Mohacs post found two barges full
of maize whose official provenance was Bosnia-Hercegovina but in fact was
Serbia. Serbia might need food, accepts Mr Bakkensen. 'But they also need
money.'
Although there is little evidence of smuggling, there can be no guarantees
that the border is sealed. Each barge can carry as many as 50 lorries and
each ship can push or pull as many as a dozen barges. The Zvezdnyy drove a
relatively modest number. Even so, the Hungarian customs entered only one of
the barges and broke into only one out of hundreds of cases of steel sheet
within it.
The sanctions enforcers could only have the reassurance of Mr Valentin
Trishin, the big-bellied Ukrainian captain of the Zvezdnyy. He gave a
gold-toothed beam, pointed down the Danube towards the border and the ruined
town of Vukovar beyond, and gestured: 'Serbia, straight through.'

FT  05 MAY 93 / Commission to draw up strategy for jobs creation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is to draw up a Community-wide jobs plan to match
and back the modest EC growth initiative agreed at last December's Edinburgh
summit.
The main object is to create a more coherent job-creation framework for what
member states - who have virtually sole jurisdiction in this area  - now do,
as well as to solicit ideas for dealing with growing structural
unemployment.
The Commission is expected to prepare a plan for June's council of social
affairs ministers, after employment ministers promised their backing at an
informal meeting yesterday in Copenhagen.
The preliminary ideas endorsed by ministers included:
greater co-operation between employment and finance ministers, and promotion
of successful national measures across the EC;
identifying ways to promote new jobs, new types of job, and cut labour
costs;
Initiatives for bringing more women into the labour force;
strengthening training, for the employed as well as jobless;
using the unemployed to fill in for those undergoing training.
Mr Padraig Flynn, social affairs commissioner, told ministers that 'in many
people's minds, the Community is part of the unemployment problem, rather
than part of the solution'. This had to be turned around. 'We need to be
seen to be putting together national actions within some common Community
framework.'
He has already won Commission approval to reform the EC Social Fund, which
spends some Ecu6bn (Pounds 4.75bn) a year on training for the long-term and
young unemployed. Under the reform, which needs the approval of the Twelve,
part of these funds would be aimed at retraining workers still employed in
industries which are restructuring.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Anger at criticism of Ilva proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S new industry minister yesterday reacted angrily to a critical
European Commission analysis of the restructuring plan prepared for Ilva,
the loss-making state-controlled steel producer.
Mr Paolo Savona told fellow EC industry ministers that Brussels seemed
prejudiced against a plan which had only been submitted on Friday.
His call for more sympathetic treatment was backed by Mr Claudio Aranzadi,
the Spanish minister, whose plans for restructuring of the Spanish steel
industry have still not won Commission approval.
Yesterday's stand-off was probably only a foretaste of the fierce debate to
come in July, when ministers will have to decide unanimously on the fate of
both state subsidy plans. They will also vote then on German proposals for
the rescue of Ekostahl, the east German producer, which were turned down by
the Commission last week.
Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, warned member states yesterday
that Brussels would stick to a consistent and tough line on state subsidies
to national steelmakers, to avoid undermining the overall EC plan for
supporting the industry.
He estimated that the new Ilva plan would involve the payment of some Ecu4bn
(Pounds 3.2bn) in state aids, mainly relating to the write-off of an
estimated L8,500bn (Pounds 3.6bn) of debt. He said subsidies on such a scale
would have to be offset by capacity cuts of up to 3m tonnes.
IRI, the Italian state holding company which controls Ilva, argues that the
new plan involves no state aid, and that the 'new' steel company it plans to
create should not be subject to production cuts.
Ministers agreed a statement saying they were 'encouraged' by the important
steps already taken to support the EC industry, which include attempts to
stabilise the Community market and protect it from cheap non-EC imports.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Export of waste is burying neighbours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY is coming under increasing pressure from its EC partners over its
ambitious waste recycling legislation, which many of them believe is
stifling their own recycling industries.
Germany does not have the processing capacity to deal with the quantities of
waste packaging that has to be collected and recycled. As a result, German
waste material is being exported to other member states, often with a
subsidy, and occupying capacity which is inhibiting the development of
indigenous recycling efforts.
Britain, backed by France and Spain, submitted a formal complaint at
yesterday's meeting of EC industry ministers, calling on the European
Commission to act. The Netherlands, Italy, Ireland and Luxembourg echoed the
complaint.
Environment ministers decided in March to set up a working group to examine
the industry in the light of the German waste laws. But the UK is now
arguing that unilateral leaps forward in environmental policy can slow the
advance of 'green' standards in the EC as a whole, and going it alone can
create distortions in the single market.
The British document says its plastics recycling sector, still in its
infancy, is getting German material 'at zero cost and delivered free of
charge, or in some cases with an incentive payment of up to Pounds 200 per
tonne'. UK imports of plastic waste rose 450 per cent last year compared
with 1991, and the organisation set up by the British plastics industry to
collect material cannot compete, the document says.
In the more developed recycling industry for paper and board, the UK says
its recyclers cannot compete against subsidised imports from Germany. It
claims 'this was a major contribution in 10 per cent of UK paper and board
manufacturers in the packaging sector being forced out of business in 1992.'

FT  05 MAY 93 / G7 set to release billions for Russia in two to three months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Group of Seven leading industrial countries is prepared to start putting
billions of dollars into the Russian economy in the next two to three months
to shore up the economic reform movement, according to senior G7 officials.
However, the Russian government must show it is prepared to tackle the
crisis with painful decisions, including allowing unemployment to rise to
several millions as credits are stopped to state enterprises.
The G7 is assuring the Russian government that funds will be released if it
is clear that 'appropriate' policies have been adopted - not, as last year,
that they must first fulfil a series of targets on inflation and on the
budget deficit which have proved impossible to meet.
The barrier of 'conditionality' imposed by the International Monetary Fund
has thus been substantially lowered by a political decision of the G7 to
support President Boris Yeltsin.
A senior G7 official said aid could start flowing as early as the end of
this month if the momentum of reform were accelerated. 'If Mr Yeltsin is
prepared to be bold now then there is no reason why the aid should not flow
by the end of May,' he said.
But the continuing political struggle within and around the Russian
government makes it unclear if even less strict criteria can be met.
Professor Jeffrey Sachs, senior foreign adviser to the Russian government,
said: 'It is a valid question as to whether actions will follow the
referendum.
'The government does have to demonstrate that it has control, especially
since without a strong central bank it is hard to have confidence. I believe
they will but it is a legitimate worry,' he said.
Professor Stanley Fischer of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
an adviser to the World Bank said: 'It is important for the west to be seen
to be helping in a major way. It is important that it put pressure on the
IMF. But at some point, the west may have to say that there has been no
progress and stop the money,' Professor Fischer said.
The direction of economic reform continues to hang in the balance.
Reformers have been buoyed by signs that Mr Yeltsin last week committed
himself to pursue reform, to promote reformers and sack conservatives.
But they have also been disappointed by lack of movement to date and by the
appointment of Mr Oleg Soskovets, a former industrial manager and minister
without a track record for reform, as a first deputy prime minister.
Western officials listed four key conditions which should be met before
funds can be released. The conditions are:
strict credit limits;
a rise in interest rates;
significant reductions in all subsidies;
a viable budget programme that is consistent with low inflation.
The funds at issue are mainly from the International Monetary Fund, which
sends a team of senior officials to Moscow today to begin negotiations on
disbursement.
The first half of a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) 'systemic transformation
facility' to be used to support the budget is likely to be agreed soon after
the IMF officials report back to Washington.
A larger sum, the Dollars 4.1bn standby fund which has been available for
over a year, could begin to be disbursed by the summer, according to the
senior G7 official.
'If the Russians really want it, they can have a standby agreement in July,'
he said.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Books etc offers full refunds to dissatisfied readers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LAST, a solution for readers who get stuck at the second chapter of
Stephen Hawking's Brief History of Time, or find the latest over-hyped
Booker Prize nominee heavy going.
Books etc, a London bookstore chain, is offering to give a full refund on
any book it sells. Its larger shops carry more than 100,000 titles. To get a
refund, dissatisfied readers will only have to produce a valid receipt and
return the books in saleable condition within 28 days of purchase.
'It really is a no quibble deal. You just get your money back. You are not
asked why you didn't like it,' says Mr Richard Joseph, founder and managing
director of Books etc, which has 10 shops in central London.
Mr Joseph believes he is the world's first book retailer to offer and
promote straight cash refunds on all titles.
'Some people will use us as a public library but I don't think many will.
It's the chance I will have to take,' says Mr Joseph, who hopes the campaign
will encourage readers to be more adventurous and buy books they may not
have heard of or even fear they may not like.
In a year which has seen one sales promotion backfire badly, as Hoover could
testify, Mr Joseph is confident he is not setting a trap for himself. He
hopes that extra sales will more than cover the returns.
His record so far is good. A few years ago, Books etc agreed to swap Love In
A Time Of Cholera by the Colombian novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez if
purchasers didn't like it. More than 3,000 were sold and only seven came
back.
The offer is the latest development in Britain's increasingly competitive
book trade. So far much of the running has been made by Mr Terry Maher,
chairman of Dillons, who has used selective discounts in his campaign
against the net book agreement, which sets minimum prices for most books.
Mr Maher said yesterday Dillons had always allowed disgruntled customers to
swap books for a credit note. Managers also had the discretion to offer cash
if that was what customers wanted. Mr Maher said he had not exactly shouted
about the option.
Mr Joseph, however, is making as much noise as possible with 4,000
advertisement cards on underground trains, 1,000 on underground escalators,
450 on the sides of London buses and in the Evening Standard newspaper. 'If
it works, it will stay for good,' he said.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Major faces retreat on Maastricht amendment: Speaker's
ruling paves way for vote on treaty's social chapter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR was facing the prospect of a damaging climbdown over the
Maastricht treaty last night after the speaker of the House of Commons ruled
that MPs should be given another chance to vote on its social chapter.
The ruling by Miss Betty Boothroyd, reversing an earlier decision by Mr
Michael Morris, the deputy speaker, precipitated a confrontation on the eve
of tomorrow's Newbury by-election and of nationwide county council polls.
It gave Tory Euro-sceptics and opposition parties the chance they had been
seeking for months - to use the social chapter to overturn the government's
majority on the treaty.
Amid conflicting legal opinions on the significance of the proposed
amendment to the Maastricht bill, victory for the government's opponents
would set the stage for a protracted legal battle over ratification.
The signs at Westminster last night were that, left with the unpalatable
choice of defeat or retreat in the House of Commons, the prime minister will
prefer the latter.
That would mean acceptance of a Labour amendment, supported for different
reasons by the Liberal Democrats and by hard-line Tory Euro-sceptics,
designed to dilute Britain's opt-out from Maastricht's social provisions.
Liberal Democrats last night voted with the government to allow debate on
Maastricht to continue until early this morning, allowing for a clash over
the amendment later today.
Mr Major's aides insisted that the amendment would not in the end affect
British ratification. Advice given to the prime minister by the
attorney-general suggests that the amendment would be a legal irritant
rather than a substantive obstacle.
The official line from Downing Street was: 'The government does not take the
view that the amendment if passed would prevent ratification of the
Maastricht treaty.' Aides added that the opt-out from the social chapter
would also remain intact if the amendment, known as amendment 2, was passed.
That assessment was fiercely rejected by the Tory Euro-sceptics who insisted
that the amendment would effectively wreck ratification by preventing the
operation of the treaty's social dimension. If the government presses ahead
regardless, the sceptics will challenge it in the High Court through the
procedure known as judicial review.
By contrast, the Labour party insisted that if the government accepted the
amendment, or was defeated in a vote, it would have little alternative but
to join the other 11 Community states in implementing the treaty's social
provisions.
All three interpretations of the potential impact of the amendment are
plausible because of the obscure wording needed to conform with the
procedures of the House of Commons. The amendment calls for the entire
protocol on the social chapter - including the opt-out - to be deleted from
the version of the treaty which will be enshrined in British law.

FT  05 MAY 93 / Changes to new fines system announced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING concern over the effects of a new system of income-related fines
yesterday forced the government to announce changes to the Criminal Justice
Act only seven months after it came into force.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, admitted after a meeting with magistrates
that the act had led to some 'absurd decisions' and needed to be amended.
The system of linking fines to income has resulted in some people with above
average earnings facing penalties of thousands of pounds for motoring
offences. In another celebrated case, an 83-year-old woman was fined Pounds
800 for not having a television licence, while the same court fined a
younger woman with a lower income Pounds 32.
Mr Clarke intends to retain the principle of unit fines linked to income,
but will reduce the banding on which the system operates. The disposable
income scales on which courts calculate fines range from Pounds 4 per week
to Pounds 100. 'I know of no tax or means-tested benefit where the spread is
1-25 so I would like to readdress that,' said Mr Clarke.
The Home Office believes some of the problems have arisen from courts
failing to appreciate the flexibility available under the new system. As an
immediate step, the government will emphasise to magistrates that they
should use the discretion open to them, pending legislation to change the
scale of fines.
Mr Clarke also intends to change another aspect of the wide-ranging act that
has been criticised by judges - limitations on courts being able to take an
offender's previous convictions into consideration when passing sentence. A
persistent reoffender was not the same as a first offender, said Mr Clarke,
and the courts should be able to take this into account.
The new arrangements have led to some magistrates resigning since they came
into effect in October. Ms Joyce Ross, who chairs the Magistrates'
Association, said after yesterday's meeting with Mr Clarke that the morale
of magistrates would be lifted by his proposals. 'Some of the changes cannot
happen overnight but at least we know there will be changes and they will be
in accord, we hope, with what we are proposing.'
The unit fine system was tested in four parts of the country without
apparent difficulty. But under the act maximum fines in magistrates' courts
rose from Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 5,000, and this has aggravated the problem.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Levi Strauss rejects investment in China

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEVI STRAUSS, the San Francisco-based clothing manufacturer known world-wide
for its denim jeans, will not make direct investments in China and will
reduce its use of contractors there because of the country's human rights
record, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco.
The company spent six months studying the issue, a spokesman said, and
concluded that China's human rights record 'is not consistent with our
global sourcing guidelines' adopted a year ago. These cover issues such as
working conditions, contractors' employment practices, and health and safety
records.
Levi, a privately held company, has operations in about 40 countries and had
worldwide revenues last year of Dollars 5.6bn (Pounds 3.56bn). Although it
had been considering an investment in China for a few years, there were no
specific proposals, the company said.
Levi will begin to cut its use of sewing and finishing contractors in China,
with a phased reduction. The decision will be reviewed every six months.
Levi has no direct investment in China. It uses about 30 contractors there
who sew and launder jeans and other products for export, accounting for
about 2 per cent of worldwide production.

KYRGYZSTAN yesterday voted to introduce its own currency following pressure
by Russia on former Soviet republics to drop the rouble as their currency
unless they adopt common conditions for its use.
One of the poorest republics to emerge from the ruins of the Soviet Union
and led by the ultra-reformist President Askar Akayev, Kyrgyzstan has dreams
of emulating Switzerland and earning its living from services and
entrepreneurship. It is the first of the former Soviet Union's central Asian
republics, traditionally among the most dependent on Moscow, to take a step
recommended by most foreign advisers. These include the IMF, which is
offering republics balance of payments support in return for economic
reform.
Mr Akayev, who is said to have taken delivery of banknotes printed in
England, yesterday overcome parliamentary opposition to the new currency,
called the som.
The precedents are frightening. Only the three Baltic republics,
traditionally the most independent of former Soviet republics, have
successfully introduced their own currencies, accompanied by harsh economic
adjustments. Ukraine, the second most populous republic with heavy industry
to support, has seen its quasi-currency, the coupon, plunge even against the
weak rouble.
Mr Akayev said yesterday that the new currency would be backed by Dollars
90m, part of aid promised by the west.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Brussels worried over steel subsidy moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission is increasingly concerned that the EC-wide plan to
support the ailing west European steel industry could be derailed by member
states' attempts to subsidise their national producers.
EC industry ministers meet today in Brussels to discuss the progress of the
plan so far, in the wake of the Commission's rejection last week of German
proposals to restructure Ekostahl, the east German producer, and scepticism
about a new rationalisation plan from Ilva, the loss-making Italian
steelmaker.
The Commission has not yet submitted formal proposals to the ministers on
any of the most controversial state subsidy cases, but it is pressing for a
special meeting in July to consider German, Italian and Spanish steel aid
plans together.
On Friday, Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, told Mr Michele
Tedeschi, the managing director of Iri, the Italian state holding company
which controls Ilva, that the Commission needed to have a clearer view of
the subsidies involved in the new plan, and the reduction of capacity it
might involve.
Iri claims the restructuring plan involves no state aid, and is based on the
behaviour of a private sector shareholder. Moreover, as the plants it plans
to retain are already efficient and competitive, they should not be subject
to production cuts.
Commission officials fear this may herald lengthy negotiations which could
jeopardise decisions on the other state aid cases, and the EC industry's own
restructuring plan.
'It's out of the question to come to a decision on the Spanish plan, or on
Ekostahl, if at the same time we drag our feet on Ilva,' said one senior
official.
The Ilva restructuring plan involves creating a new company, Nuova
Siderurgica, specialising in flat laminates.
Nuova Siderurgica, with assets of L2,770bn (Dollars 1.9bn) and net
shareholders' funds of L1,900bn, would be profitable and have a 'balanced'
financial position, according to Iri.
Net borrowing at the group would be just a fraction of Ilva's L7,583bn net
debts at the end of last year.
Other Ilva operations and shareholdings will be sold, either directly, or
via Iri, to raise L2,700bn.
Iri would also take on some Ilva debt as part of the liquidation of the
remaining operations. A precise figure has not been revealed, but has been
estimated at about L2,500bn.
The proceeds of asset sales would be used to lower Ilva's debts.
The group, which is Europe's fourth biggest steelmaker, reported a net group
loss of L2,309bn last year on sales of L10,087bn.
Iri will be sole owner of the new company at the outset, but intends
gradually to lower its stake below 50 per cent, perhaps through joint
ventures with domestic or foreign steelmakers.
It is hard to see how the new company will raise L2,700bn through asset
sales given the present European steel crisis.
Much of the cash may come from 'selling' assets to Iri, which will then
oversee their eventual disposal.
The chances of bringing private shareholders into Nuova Siderurgica also
look slim in the short term.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Danes try to allay fears over Maastricht treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DANISH government and the European Commission yesterday moved quickly to
dampen controversy caused by a leaked note by a senior EC lawyer saying
Denmark's exemptions from the Maastricht treaty are probably unenforceable.
Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, Danish foreign minister, insisted that the treaty
opt-outs are binding in international law. A senior EC official declared
that the leaked private opinion by Mr Donald Allen, a British lawyer at the
European Commission, was a 'non-story'.
Weekend publication of the note just two weeks before the second Danish
referendum on the Maastricht treaty on May 18 is an embarrassment for the
Yes campaigners. Part of their appeal rests on their contention that Denmark
won new, legally binding treaty exemptions on monetary union, defence policy
and immigration at the EC summit in Edinburgh last December.
In practice, the issue is less clear-cut. Danish opt-outs are more a clever
piece of Brussels drafting which spells out previously agreed exemptions but
does not amend the substance of the treaty. This would have required
re-ratification of Maastricht, an unacceptable risk for member states.
Mr Allen, 63, sent a private note siding with the opinion of three British
legal experts and noted Euro-sceptics who attacked the legal status of
Denmark's opt-outs. But after the contents of the note appeared in the
British press last weekend, Mr Allen beat a hasty retreat.
In a statement issued in Brussels yesterday, Mr Allen said: 'My comments
given in an informal way as a matter of courtesy referred only to the
professional reputation of one of the authors and the technical quality of
the presentation of the legal opinion referred to in the articles, but not
to its merit and conclusions.
'On the contrary, I fully share the Commission's view which indeed I have
never doubted, that the decision agreed in Edinburgh by the heads of state
and government, in order to answer the Danish request, is binding in
international law. I regard the use of my name in such a serious matter as a
blatant act of bad faith.'
Mr Allen was said to be on holiday yesterday and unavailable. Well before
the weekend controversy, he was due to take early retirement next year after
20 years' service with the Commission, officials said.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Long convalescence predicted for sluggish economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and KEITH FRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECOVERY has started, but Britain's leading forecasters have low
expectations for the economy's performance.
The latest consensus among 40 leading forecasters is that the economy will
grow by 1.5 per cent this year, only slightly higher than the 1 per cent
predicted at the end of last year.
The latest Financial Times survey of forecasts shows that recent good news
on the economy has scarcely affected a cautious set of predictions.
Economists from the City, academia and independent think tanks, generally
believe that this will be a year of weak growth, rising unemployment, a
worsening trade deficit and weak inflationary pressures.
The forecasts were made shortly before publication of first-quarter gross
domestic product data showing that, excluding oil and gas production, the
economy grew by 0.6 per cent on the previous quarter.
The biggest revisions have occurred in predictions for the trade balance.
Although economists now expect exports to perform better than they did six
months ago, they have sharply revised their forecasts for growth in import
volumes. The consensus forecast is for a current account deficit of Pounds
16.6bn this year and Pounds 17.6bn in 1994.
Mr Bill Martin, chief economist at UBS, and one of those gloomiest about UK
trade, said the ideal strategy to close Britain's trade gap would involve
further depreciation of sterling and sizeable rises in taxation aimed at
constraining consumer demand, but he is not optimistic that the government
will follow such a course.
According to the survey another interest rate cut is likely during the
summer, particularly if the recovery starts to falter. A significant
minority, however, expect rates to rise by the end of the year as the
government takes fright over rising inflation.
Mr Richard Jeffrey, head of research at Charterhouse Tilney, said: 'The
economy has now been well primed for recovery. By the end of the year the
Treasury should be thinking of taking some of the steam out of consumer
demand by edging rates upwards.'
This contradicts a more optimistic general view on inflation. Most
economists do not expect underlying inflation to go significantly higher
than the 4 per cent upper limit of the Treasury's target range. Even the
worst-case scenario has it just 1.9 percentage points higher at the end of
next year.
Mr David Smith, chief economist at Williams de Broe, is one of few to take a
dimmer view. 'To an economic historian, present fiscal policies are
reminiscent of the build-up to hyper-inflation usually only found in
war-time situations.'
General optimism about inflation is reflected in quite low forecasts for
average earnings. One of the most bullish comes from Mr Roger Bootle of
Greenwell Montagu. 'The pay inflation problem is a thing of the past. We
have finally banished the inflationary hangovers from the 1970s and have
created a new pay culture.'
But Mr Neil Blake, research director of Business Strategies, said: 'I can
see no way in which some upturn in wage inflation can be avoided . . . I
think there has been a downwards step in the underlying medium-term rate of
wage inflation, but it has not come down as far as this year's figures would
suggest.'
Mr Gerard Lyons of DKB International said wages would be curbed for the next
18 months by rising unemployment and low headline inflation. 'But during
1994, skills shortages, boardroom pay rises, future VAT hikes and a creeping
up of retail prices will add to wage pressures,' he added.
With a few exceptions, notably Mr Chris Dillow at Nomura, economists are
still troubled by the state of public-sector finances. Mr Dillow believes
the failure of the government to balance the budget over the medium term has
no economic implications. 'The only consequence is media hot air,' he said.
But many others believe the size of the public sector borrowing requirement
 -forecast to rise to more than 8 per cent of GDP in the next financial year
 -will increase the long-term risk of high inflation and high real interest
rates and increase the burden of debt interest.
Mr Richard Freeman, senior economist at Imperial Chemical Industries, said
the government's own forecasts suggest a public sector borrowing requirement
that is too high for a sustainable recovery.
'If the PSBR is still at 3.75 per cent of GDP in 1997-98 then the UK economy
will be a slow-growth economy with high interest rates,' he said.
The March Budget measures to increase taxation are generally not considered
to have gone far enough in reducing the deficit and a third of the 40
economists surveyed said the chancellor should raise taxes again. Some,
however, believe the government should concentrate on cutting spending.
Mr Keith Wade and Mr David Gasparro of Schroders said public expenditure
should bear the brunt of deficit reduction in the November Budget. Tax
increases without firm control of spending were of little use.
Monthly falls in unemployment in February and March have not persuaded
economists that unemployment has stopped rising, although most have brought
forward their forecasts for when it will peak. A majority believes the
jobless total will start to fall towards the end of the year, after peaking
at just more than 3m.
More than half of the economists surveyed believe that base rates have not
yet reached their floor. Several factors could prompt another 1 point cut to
5 per cent, they said. These include a worsening of the German recession -
which would affect Britain's export performance - a decision by the
government to tighten fiscal policy substantially, or signs that the
recovery was faltering.
A majority of economists believe sterling is at about the right level
against the D-Mark. But a vociferous few said the size of the trade gap at
the end of a long recession reflected an over-valued currency.
Mr David Mackie of JP Morgan said: 'With a substantial trade deficit at the
end of a long and deep recession, the implication is that the real exchange
rate is too high.'
Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University is far and away the most
optimistic about the trade balance with his forecast for a current account
deficit of only Pounds 11bn this year and Pounds 5bn in the next.
He believes that 1994 will be a year of world trade recovery which, provided
Britain maintains its competitive edge through a devalued pound and slow
wage growth, will benefit UK exports. Moderate growth, meanwhile, will limit
imports.
Virtually none believes the UK should rejoin the ERM. Mr James Barty of
Morgan Grenfell asked: 'Is it possible to commit suicide twice?'
Professor Wynne Godley of Cambridge University decided not to take part in
the latest survey while he adjusts his model of the economy.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Hong Kong (12): Emphasis on productivity -
Industrial development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OF Asia's four dragons, Hong Kong is the only state whose government has not
tried to transform an efficient low-cost manufacturing base into a high
technology production line which can compete head-on with Japan and the US,
writes Simon Davies.
Fourteen year's after the door to China was opened, much of Hong Kong's
industrial heritage has been transferred into offices and shopping centres,
rather than gleaming new factories.
The laissez faire prop against which the Hong Kong government has leaned
since 1841, has prevented it from adopting the ambitious strategies that
spawned the computer components and telecommunications products of
Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan.
But as Hong Kong continues to evolve into a financial and services centre,
the pressures of some of the highest land and labour costs in Asia appear to
have give the government second thoughts about its stance.
Mr Ricky Fung, acting director general of the government's Industry
Department, stands by the philosophy of 'minimum intervention, maximum
support.' In spite of this, the government is taking serious measures to
encourage the inflow of overseas technologies, so that Hong Kong can retain
some kind of industrial base.
BY the end of December 1992, 565,100 people were employed in industry,
compared with 870,000 in 1986. Mr Fung said the government does not believe
in saving industries that are not competitive; in a territory which has to
import labour to meet the demands of a voracious economy, there is no
political pressures to save jobs.
Instead, the emphasis is on productivity rather than head count, and Hong
Kong has been faring well in this respect. Productivity increased by 18 per
cent last year, and it is now 80 per cent higher in real terms than it was a
in 1983.
This reflects the fact that the majority of industries have been relocating
production facilities, and those that cannot, have been replacing workers
with machinery. The resultant boost in productivity helped achieve a minimal
increase in domestic exports during 1992 to Dollars HK234bn.
This trend is continuing. Nomura Research Institute estimates that Hong Kong
retained imports of capital goods amounted Dollars HK73bn Kong last year,
indicating the level of new spending on machinery.
This represented an increase of more than 20 per cent from 1991 - outpacing
growth in retained imports of raw materials and consumer goods - and it
suggests that the outlook for productivity remains positive, in the
short-term at least.
In order to encourage this trend, the government has toned down its laissez
faire inclinations to permit a new applied research and development scheme.
This is a Dollars HK200m fund, which will match the investment of any
start-up company which fulfills certain criteria, in exchange for an equity
stake. This represents the first step towards direct government funding for
research and development, and by implication, the creation of a Government
industrial policy.
But it is a very tentative step, and local industrialists believe that in
the longer-term Hong Kong will not be able to compete in anything other than
niche manufacturing. Mr Patrick Wang, managing director of Johnson Electric
 -one of the world's largest manufacturers of micro-motors - says that as a
manufacturing base Hong Kong can be more meaningfully compared to
Switzerland than to other south-east Asian countries.
Johnson is one of the few Hong Kong industrial companies which has succeeded
in competing with the Japanese in high-technology production. It produces
motors for consumer electronics products and car accessories from plants in
China, Thailand and Switzerland.
The company still employs 1,000 people in Hong Kong, and this represents a
crucial base for leveraging the cheap production facilities in China, where
it employs 7,000 workers. But Mr Wang argues that 'to survive, we have to
think and act more like the Swiss.'
Johnson's plant in Switzerland has operating costs around double those of
Hong Kong, but the differential is shrinking fast. The key, according to Mr
Wang, is that Hong Kong has to focus on technical proficiency, rigid cost
control and more creative use of technology.
The government is making some effort to help this. It has provided a Dollars
HK250m grant for an Industry and Technology Centre, a new University of
Science and Technology was recently completed, and plans have been initiated
for a Dollars HK2.8bn science park (government contributions would be much
lower). In addition, its industrial estates in Tai Po and Yuen Long provide
land for high-tech industries at significantly below market rates.
But for many of Hong Kong's manufacturers becoming 'Swiss' is not an option.
Mr Jack Lau, managing director of Tomei International, one of Hong Kong's
largest consumer electronics manufacturers, argues that 'for the traditional
low-end manufacturers, there is no choice. Relocating to China is a matter
of survival'.
As industrialists gain further experience of China production, they are
finding that the workforce has more to offer than just cheap export
processing. Hong Kong companies are recruiting Chinese science graduates for
research and development projects, further replacing the role of Hong Kong's
domestic industry.
However, there have been a few successes in importing industry. The German
media giant, Bertelsmann, recently purchased a 55 per cent stake in
Sonopress Asia, a compact disc manufacturing company.
Mr Henry Chow, managing director of Sonopress, says the venture has been a
success, but its full potential is in the eventual opening up of the China
market. The company has capacity to manufacture 17m compact discs a year,
and already controls around 40 per cent of the Hong Kong market, but at
present China is effectively off-limits.
Mr Clive Weedon, head of research at Nomura, suggests that domestic
manufacturing is going into inevitable decline - 'as 1997 approaches, it is
difficult to envisage Hong Kong providing any more than support services for
the Pearl River delta, along with some specialised niche production.'

FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Hong Kong (11): US stockbrokers in determined mood
 -Financial markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the mid-1980s, the US securities houses launched an attack on the
hitherto protected Tokyo Stock market - and won; in the early 1990s they are
attempting to do the same in Hong Kong.
Within a six-month period last year, Salomon Brothers, Goldman Sachs,
Shearson Lehman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch all started the process of
expanding luxurious Hong Kong offices, and bidding up the prices of stock
exchange seats and, more expensively, experienced local stock brokers.
The invasion was far more dramatic than the US retreat in early 1990, when
Morgan Stanley and BT Brokerage both shut down offices, and Citicorp Vickers
started another round of staff cuts. But the comparison has led to a certain
degree of cynicism from existing practitioners.
This time, however, there is no doubting their determination. In a recent
survey on global stockbroking houses by Greenwich, the first two places in
Hong Kong went to Baring Securities and WI Carr.
In recent months, the respective managing directors of those houses have
been poached by Salomons and Goldman Sachs, for undisclosed (but undoubtedly
substantial) amounts. And Goldman Sachs' had to snatch Nick Harbinson from
the talons of Merril Lynch.
The costs of this adventure will not be small. The colony has the world's
second highest office prices, while the enhanced interest in the exchange
has already tripled the price of seats to Dollars 1.8m in the past year.
Brokers salaries have spiked accordingly.
There is a very limited pool of skilled labour available, and with this
level of demand, wage claims have reached the outrageous. Even over the
border in China, where Hong Kong's industrial sector relocated to reduce its
operating costs, US-educated Mainland Chinese have negotiated wages at
international rather than Chinese levels.
Some are commanding salaries of up to Dollars US150,000 with the big
corporate finance houses.
Opinions differ over whether they will ever get a pay-back. Mr Raymond Lai,
managing director of Smith Barney (Asia), argues: 'If they are prepared to
take a four or five-year view, then they will do well.'
Few believe that there won't be any fall-out before this perceived
break-even point, which will be ironically close to 1997.
There is an argument that the Hong Kong stock market has now picked up
sufficient size and turnover to make it a worthwhile venue for the big
players. Certainly, average daily turnover more than doubled in 1992 to
Dollars HK2.8bn.
Mr William Phillips, managing director of Salomon Brothers Hong Kong,
argues: 'US fund managers need big ponds to swim in. These south east Asian
stock markets were little puddles before.'
In a 'people business' like broking, it is possible for anybody to break in
if they are prepared to pay enough, and Hong Kong, unlike other south east
Asian markets, offers few barriers to entry. But with the increasing levels
of competition, agency broking profit margins have already become razor
thin, since market turnover cannot keep pace with costs.
With western economies continuing to slumber, there has been an inevitable
focus on the higher growth markets of Asia (excluding Japan), but it is
conceivable that this enthusiasm may die down with an economic up-turn.
'There is concern that however much the market expands, there is not going
to be enough business to sustain the number of people chasing it,' said a
local 'head-hunter.'
One positive sign is the fact that the UK's largest independent pension fund
manager, Mercury, has just set up a fund management office in Hong Kong,
recognising the increased demand for a focus on the high growth Asian
markets.
The managing director of Warburg Asset Management Hong Kong, Mr Han Ong,
said it had become increasingly important to maintain or improve
performance, given that Warburg now had close to Dollars US1bn invested in
Hong Kong.
But Mr Ong is not expecting any flood of new funds to follow brokerage
offices into Hong Kong, except through changes in asset allocation; and he
argued that the Hong Kong stock market was already over-broked.
Recently-arrived brokerages, such as Kleinwort Benson Securities and also
UBS Securities, have all focused their attention on traditional agency
stockbroking, but the ambitions of the US giants stretch towards higher
margin businesses. The Americans are already building up corporate finance
and derivatives teams, to make use of their large capital base and technical
expertise in other markets.
The China concept has loomed large in this respect, because this provides an
enormous new market for fund raising.
NINE sizable mainland companies are due to be floated in Hong Kong within a
year, and there numerous others state companies competing for foreign
capital, through 'B' share issues, or bonds.
In the 1980s the Americans tried a strategy of importing technically astute
representatives from within the group, expecting them to perform in these
alien markets. This was not a success in the contacts-driven Asian markets,
so they are now trying a more successful formula of buying up local talent,
and attaching that to their distribution networks in America.
Five of the nine corporate finance mandates for the Hong Kong listings have
been handed out; Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs secured roles in arguably
the two prime flotations, Shanghai Petrochemical and Qingdao Brewery.
Merrill Lynch, without ever having handled a public offer in Hong Kong
before, was awarded the global distribution mandate for what will probably
be the largest-ever public offer in Hong Kong, Shanghai Petrochemical.
This indicates the power of the big US franchises. But this still does not
equate to profit, since competition has been so tight for Chinese mandates,
that winning bidders are not expecting to make any profit from the deals
whatsoever.
On the derivatives side, Salomons has already purchased a seat on the
Futures Exchange, and is in the process of building up a team. This will be
a big focus of resources, and the other US houses are expected to follow
suit.
Salomon's Phillips argues that it was just a matter of the US houses waiting
for the right time to move in. He claims that 'within three to five years, I
believe that three out of the top ten brokerages in Hong Kong will be
American.'
It may prove more difficult to obtain those rankings in terms of
profitability.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Hong Kong (9): Rebuilding southern China in its
own image - Hong Kong's growing influence in the mainland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the 1980s, Hong Kong shifted its low-cost manufacturing businesses across
the border; but in the 1990s it is already in the advanced stages of
rebuilding southern China in its own image, and it is now turning its
attention further north.
In the flat marshland around the Pearl River delta, factories are already
giving way to residential tower blocks, shopping malls are being constructed
to sell Hong Kong brand names, and the area is scarred with motorways and
power stations; almost all of it is funded with Hong Kong capital. Guangzhou
even has a Hong Kong-funded race-course.
Only two years ago, China business concepts were spurned as unduly risky,
but as the economic ties between the two have evolved, attitudes have
changed radically.
Mr Henry Cheng, managing director of New World Development, one of Hong
Kong's property giants, argues: 'After 1997, Hong Kong will be part of
China, so if you are planning to invest in Hong Kong, you might as well
invest in China. The cost is much less and the potential profit is much
more.'
Hong Kong manufacturing companies already employ an estimated three million
people in Guangdong province, and in 1992, more than 20 million Hong Kong
people crossed the border into China - almost four trips a year for every
man, woman and child in the colony.
'In many ways, Guangdong Province is becoming like a substantially bigger
New Territories,' said Mr Tim Williams, director of Schroders Asia.
In the late-1970s, Hong Kong's New Territories was an expanse of farmland,
but now it has a population of 2.3m and its main city, Shatin, boasts one of
the busiest McDonald's restaurant in the world.
The links between Hong Kong and Guangdong Province are already economically
unbreakable. Hongkong Bank has estimated that close to 30 per cent of Hong
Kong's notes and coins in circulation are held in China (where they
represent a tradeable currency, and a hedge against the further devaluation
of the Renminbi).
The border city of Shenzhen is constructed in the Hong Kong style, and
continued growth in Guangdong (the Province) is contingent, in the
short-term, on more capital from the colony. Hong Kong accounted for more
than 60 per cent of all investment into China last year.
A survey by Credit Lyonnais, the French securities company, of Hong Kong
investment flows into China has discovered that listed companies in Hong
Kong are involved in at least 802 projects over the border, and that the
total value of projects involving local companies (in discloseable
transactions) comes to Dollars HK521bn. This represents one third of the
entire capitalisation of the Hong Kong stock market.
A number of these projects are exceptionally long-term, and some may never
materialise. But Credit Lyonnais estimates the current site area of Hong
Kong's land bank in China - at 2.37bn sq ft - is almost three times the land
mass of Hong Kong island.
Property projects accounted for 40 per cent of total investment. Another 5
per cent was channeled into manufacturing, but the largest target was
infra-structure, accounting for 47 per cent of the total amount.
The investment in infra-structure is an important indicator, since it
suggests a level of long-term commitment that has rarely been a hallmark of
Hong Kong corporate investment. Mr Gordon Wu's Hopewell Holdings, was the
trailblazer for these projects. His Guangzhou (Canton) to Shenzhen
Superhighway took a decade to negotiate and has required substantial trust
and patience, but ultimately it is likely to be highly profitable.
Numerous Hong Kong-listed companies are constructing joint venture power
stations to try to meet China's voracious appetite for power; China Light &amp;
Power, Hopewell, New World, Lippo, China Strategic, Kumagai Gumi (Hongkong)
and Citic Pacific, are all involved in such projects. Significant capital is
also going into developing feeder ports for Hong Kong's own container
terminal.
The majority of Hong Kong companies may continue to spread the philosophy of
quick-fire construction and sale, but, like Hopewell, there are a number of
companies which are looking further ahead. Mr Peter Woo, Chairman of Wharf,
has developed the compelling concept of building highly efficient
transportation links with the city of Wuhan in central China.
This will create a conduit for goods from China's most populous province of
Sichuan. Wharf is already planning a Wuhan containerisation terminal, so
that the role of Hong Kong's service economy can stretch far beyond
Guangdong.
Mr Yu Chung-po has gone further still. The chairman of Kumagai Gumi
(Hongkong) is planning to replicate the entire formula for Hong Kong's
success on the tip of Hainan Island, which lies to the South of Guangdong.
Yangpu, for which Kumagai has a 70-year lease, is the only genuine free
trade zone in China. The developer will construct power stations, an airport
and container terminal, to serve a light industrial export zone with a
population of 250,000. Investment costs in the next five years will exceed
Dollars HK10bn.
What makes it unique, however, is that there are no currency or trade
restrictions, minimal tax and no duty, while planning permission will be
controlled by Kumagai and not China.
Some analysts are doubtful that China will fully abide by Yangpu's autonomy,
but Mr Yu argues that 'China has never violated any contract, once it has
signed it'.
The project has the firm backing of Premier Li Peng, and as a hedge, Chinese
partners account for 55 per cent of the development consortium, so the state
will benefit from the success of the project.
It remains debatable whether China is ready for such projects. Per capita
income is Dollars US355, compared with Dollars US1,799 in neighbouring
Thailand. But the reality is not as clear-cut, since China's figures ignore
state housing and transport subsidies, salary bonuses, and the extreme
regional variations in wealth.
Just 14 years after it became a Special Economic Zone, Hong Kong's border
city of Shenzhen has a population of over two million, and the average
household owns more than one colour television.
China has always been highly regionalised, and it was only logical that the
Cantonese of Hong Kong should focus on business with the Cantonese of
Guangdong. Business in China is based on contacts and trust, and the racial
link enhances both.
Guangdong has a population of more than 60m of the most affluent people in
China, and as Mr Williams says: 'If all that Hong Kong is, in the future, is
the entrepot and service centre for Guangdong Province, then that is not a
bad position to be in.'
But department stores are already multiplying in the northern cities of
Beijing and Shanghai, and these are doing the statistically improbable and
selling Dollars US1,000 pairs of shoes, indicating a rapid northward
migration of capital.
Dickson Concepts, the Hong Kong luxury goods company which owns Harvey
Nicholls in London, plans to open three luxury stores in China this year;
only one of these is in the south. According to Credit Lyonnais, Guangdong
Province accounts for only 50 per cent of Hong Kong listed companies'
investment in China.
China faces the political imperative of using Guangdong's formula for
wealth-generation to rebuild the poorer northern provinces, and Hong Kong's
businessmen are already playing a front line role.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Hong Kong (8): Pressures mount over 1997 - Alain
Cass on attitudes among the Hong Kong Chinese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAIN CASS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG is schizoid about 1997. This is hardly surprising. For 150 years
it has lived life in the fast lane, conditioned to thinking short-term.
Identifying with neither Britain nor China, life for Hong Kong Chinese
revolved around the family, the clan and money which they accumulated as if
there was no tomorrow. In a sense, there wasn't. If they didn't make it,
they just moved on.
All that is changing. Hong Kong is now having to come to terms with a future
which, for the first time, promises certainty: tomorrow is life as part of
the People's Republic of China and people are having to make up their mind
where they stand.
A recent survey of attitudes to the takeover underlined the paradox of Hong
Kong's situation. Most people were deeply gloomy about the future in
general. They foresaw a loss of freedom and a fall in their living
standards.
But asked how they and their families would fare personally they were much
more cheerful. Their children would have more opportunities because the
elite were leaving in their thousands, thus creating room at the top. South
China was taking off economically which meant jobs and business
opportunities.
Prof. Wong Siulin, who teaches social sciences at Hong Kong University,
expresses a different side of this split vision - 'I have always been deeply
ambivelant about China,' he says.' On the one hand, I am very suspicious of
its leadership. I was shocked by what happened at Tienanmen Square. But it
also matters a lot to me to be Chinese. The sense of unity is deeply
ingrained, not so much because China is a great power, although that is part
of it. It's far more a sense of history, a sense of family.'
He still remembers how, during Mao's Great Leap Forward which devastated
China, he would go, with his mother, to his local post office in Hong Kong
to send food parcels and cooking oil to relatives trapped in Guandong
province after the communist take-over. One of his uncles has since built a
house - for the two daughters he left behind - for Pounds 6,000, 'out of a
sense of guilt I think, as much as anything else.' For Hong and China, read
East and West Germany.
The dilemma for Hong Kong's Chinese community now is how to reconcile
China's emotional pull with the urge to develop a distinct local identity to
preserve its cherished freedoms. The events of June 4, 1989 when the
communist leadership ruthlessly snuffed out the student revolt in Peking,
provided a horrifying glimpse of a possible future. A million people poured
on to the streets to protest.
Political parties won a big boost as people began to think seriously, many
for the first time, about what they stood for and whether they had a future
in Hong Kong after 1997. Many concluded they did not - and voted with their
feet. The haemorrhage has been running at the rate of 60,000 a year.
Mr Chris Patten's arrival has provided a new rallying point. Politics has
become more focussed and more vociferous, but the absolute numbers who are
actively involved have not grown. Students, if anything, are becoming less
political. Student unions are having trouble filling posts. At an individual
level, young people have reverted to doing what comes naturally - bettering
themselves. Faced with the choice of the ideal and the practical, Hong Kong
man will almost invariably choose the latter.
Even ardent Patten supporters are inwardly divided. Their heart applauds his
eleventh-hour poker game, but their head tells them that, in the long run,
it may not make much difference.
'If we don't stand up to them now,' said the chairman of a big local
business over dinner,' they'll get away with murder when they take take over
 -maybe literally . . . but ultimately,' he concedes, 'Hong Kong cannot
confront China. We have to work with them.'
Like many others, he and his children have a 'parachute' - a British
passport and an overseas bank account.
At a deeper level there are few signs of social dislocation, given the
uncertainty which the territory faces.
Hong Kong society appears remarkably stable. It has a low suicide rate, an
enviably low and falling crime rate and a divorce rate which, while rising,
remains lower than that in comparable societies. Drugs is not a serious
problem in schools, although the Triads, Hong Kong's 'mafia,' are
everywhere.
Whether it stays that way is largely up to China. If, post-1997, Peking is
heavy-handed, or if it tries to dilute Hong Kong's local identity by
flooding the place with northerners, as it has done elsewhere on the
mainland to secure its grip, then there could be serious social tensions.
But if it adopts a cooler approach then an infinitely flexible Hong Kong
will merely adapt and learn to work a different system.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Hong Kong (6): A surge of interest from the
mainland - China's investment in Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the least appreciated aspects of the Hong Kong's and China's economic
integration is the extent of mainland Chinese involvement in the colony's
economy. Four years away from the transfer of sovereignty, China has built
itself a position in Hong Kong's economy that is second to none.
Mainland interests have taken to doing business in Hong Kong with an
alacrity that still amazes local observers. With the crumbling of central
controls on the mainland - the result of the decentralisation of power from
Beijing to the provinces - a singular entrepreneurial spirit, and quite a
lot of greed, has been unleashed.
The totality of China's investments and claims on Hong Kong is something
which can only be guessed. A mainland study published in 1991 estimated that
China's direct investment in Hong Kong amounted to HKDollars 78bn.
A more recent mainland study estimated that China had invested HKDollars
156bn in Hong Kong and Macao during 1992 alone.
These figures are impossible to verify, but could well be accurate. But an
indication of the scale of known mainland investment in Hong Kong is
indicated by mainland investment in the Hong Kong stock market, the property
market and the level of deposits which mainland banks have in Hong Kong. For
example:
Mainland interests exercise known control over 19 listed companies on the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The aggregate market value of these companies is
about HKDollars 70bn.
Mainland figures, some of whom are officers in, or have close links to, the
People's Liberation Army and other agencies of the Chinese government, head
other nominally Hong Kong companies.
China's involvement in the Hong Kong market is set to increase significantly
when plans to list nine large state-owned Chinese companies on the exchange
come to fruition over the coming 12 months.
These nine - which embrace brewing, petrochemicals and shipping, among
others - are seen as just the first wave of mainland listings in Hong Kong,
prompting some analysts to forecast that by 2,000 China-backed companies
could account for half of the total market capitalisation of the Hong Kong
market.
But the activities of China's quoted companies are still modest compared
with the activities of the privately-held 'four heavenly sisters' - Bank of
China group, China Merchants, China Resources, and China Travel service. In
aggregate, they are responsible for at least 15 per cent of Hong Kong's
trade.
Mainland Chinese investors have also been big players in Hong Kong's
property market. According to Brooke Hillier, a property consultancy,
mainland interest are the largest external investors in the colony's
property market - with an estimated 3 per cent ownership of Hong Kong's
property stock, valued at more than HKDollars 50bn.
According to Mr Nicholas Brooke, the firm's senior partner, mainland
investors have shown themselves to be astute players of the property market.
They were large investors in Hong Kong's residential market in early 1991
and benefited from the 60 per cent rise in prices that year and the 25 to 30
per cent rise in prices in the first half of last year.
At that time they switched into office properties, benefiting since from the
30 to 40 per cent rise in capital values for prime office space, as well as
spotting the bottom of the rental cycle.
Mr Brooke says that mainland investors have also been imaginative in 'buying
wholesale and selling retail' - that is, purchasing a building and then
selling strata titles over individual floors and offices.
China also has a sizeable claim on Hong Kong's banking system. The colony's
banking system's net indebtedness to mainland Chinese banks - deposits held
by mainland banks minus Hong Kong banks' loans to China - at the end of last
year amounted to HKDollars 42.4bn.
The rise in the mainland's claims on Hong Kong's banks has risen
dramatically since the mid-1980s and is a direct consequence of the
progressive loosening of foreign exchange controls in China and the rapid
growth in foreign business involvement in the Chinese economy.
Monetary officials in Hong Kong also believe that the preference for Hong
Kong dollar financial assets reflects a widespread lack of confidence in
China with the renminbi (RMB) - China's currency. Over the past 15 months
the RMB has devalued by more than 40 per cent against the US and Hong Kong
dollars.
It would be tempting to view China's growing position in Hong Kong's economy
as part of a grand design to take over the colony before 1997.
But try as it might, it is unlikely that Beijing can, in any meaningful
sense, control the activities of mainland companies any more than it can
control what is happening in the south of the country. The Xinhua News
Agency in Hong Kong - Beijing's unofficial embassy in the colony - has been
conducting a vigorous campaign to unseat Mr Chris Patten, the colony's
governor.
It has attempted - though Cultural Revolution-style 'struggle sessions' - to
make mainland businessmen boycott the Hong Kong government.
But as one senior mainland businessman noted: 'We have nothing to do with
Xinhua. They want to control us, but they cannot. China has too many
companies in Hong Kong.'
A more plausible explanation for the presence of mainland companies in Hong
Kong is the colony's role as an open financial centre and the colony's
status as 'foreign' for business purposes on the mainland.
It is an aspect of Deng Xiaoping's 'socialism with Chinese characteristics'
that this 'foreign' status applies to Hong Kong registered subsidiaries of
mainland companies.
All regions on the mainland offer tax holidays and a much reduced tax rate
to foreign joint ventures.
Regulations governing the management of joint ventures - including that
hiring and firing of labour is easier, pay and conditions can be related to
market conditions, and there is greater freedom to keep foreign earnings
offshore - are also much more lenient than those which state-owned
enterprises have to follow.
In this sense then, Hong Kong has a crucial role to play in China's
industrial modernisation. But it is also a location for mainland interests -
the military and senior Communist Party officials - to accumulate private
wealth.
In May last year a consortium of mainland and Hong Kong interests, led by
Hong Kong Macao Holdings, agreed to pay the Jardine-controlled Hongkong Land
HKDollars 3.8bn for an office block in the Central district of Hong Kong.
Mr Hu Jinguang, Hong Kong Macao's chairman, in spite of his Panamanian
passport, is believed to be a colonel in the People's Liberation Army.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Hong Kong (7): 'Red chip' companies are aiming
high - Guandong Investment (GI), a pace-setter among mainland companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST year saw the emergence of 'red chip' as a term applied to mainland
companies listed in Hong Kong with bright prospects, writes Simon Holberton.
Of a group of about 20 or so red chips, two stand out: Citic Pacific, which
is controlled by China International Trust and Investment Corporation of
Beijing, and Guangdong Investment, GI, the provincial government of
Guangdong's listed vehicle in the colony.
Citic Pacific is by far the bigger of the two. Its market capitalisation is
around HKDollars 35bn, thanks mostly to its large minority investments in
Hongkong Telecom and Cathay Pacific.
GI's market capitalisation is just HKDollars 4.5bn, but, according to Mr Hou
Deyou, a director and deputy general manager of the company, 'our objective
is to build Guangdong Investment into a very big company like Citic
Pacific.' In this objective it has set a cracking pace.
GI is 44.6 per cent owned by Guangdong Enterprises, GE, one of the
provincial government of Guangdong's main corporations. GE acquired a
controlling interest in Union Globe, a listed Hong Kong company, in 1987 and
renamed it Guangdong Investments in 1988 and has since been selling it
assets, mainly located on the mainland.
The 'ownership' of GE is a little unclear. It is technically owned by
Guangdong Yue Hai Import and Export Corporation, except that the directors
of Yue Hai are appointed by GE. In reality, it seems, the directors of GE
are appointments made at the highest level of Guangdong's Communist Party
and governmental apparatus.
GE, and, by extension GI have only one purpose: the economic development of
Guangdong. Although GI has some hotel and property assets in Hong Kong, the
bulk of its investments and investment plans concern Guangdong.
The company has four core businesses: property development and investment,
tourism and hotels, manufacturing, and wholesale and retail distribution.
GI has extensive land holdings in Guangdong, equivalent to 34m square feet
of developable space, mainly for residential purposes. But its most
significant property investment - which overlaps with many of its core
interests - is its 33 per cent share of Teem Corporation, a joint venture
company, which will develop the Tianhe district of Guangzhou, the provincial
capital of Guangdong.
IN the eastern part of the city, Tianhe has been designated by the Guangzhou
authorities as the city's new financial and commercial centre. Mr Hou said
that Teem is the first company to be given the right to run wholesale and
retail businesses in the city; it plans two large office developments, one
of 48 stories and the other of 38 stories, which will include a hotel,
office and retail facilities.
The Teem investment also underlines the peculiar nature of 'foreign'
investment in China. GI's 30 per cent interest in Teem - Yuan500m - was
funded with Hong Kong dollars. From an official Chinese perspective it is
therefore a foreign joint venture.
According to Mr Hou, 'joint ventures are much more flexible than state-owned
companies. When a state-owned company wants to pay a bonus it is quite
difficult. With a joint venture, if a manager thinks any action is helpful
to the business, then he can do it.
'Tax is also lower: in a special economic zone, it is just 15 per cent, in
other parts of Guangdong it is 30 per cent and in an open area of Guangdong
it is 24 per cent. But for a state-owned company it is 50 per cent.'
GI also has sizeable investments in manufacturing in the Pearl River Delta
region of Guangdong. It has 51.6 per cent interest in Guangzhou Malting, the
largest producer in Asia of malt for beer. The company produces 60,000
tonnes a year and has plans to expand capacity to 150,000 tonnes by 1995.
GI took its interest in beer a stage further with its acquisition in June
last year of an effective 24.5 per cent interest in Shenzhen Brewery, whose
products Kingsway and Holsten, which it brews under license, have an 80 per
cent share of the Shenzhen market. It also has plans to develop public
houses in Shenzhen.
Its other main manufacturing investment is a 60.8 per cent stake in a
washing machine manufacturer, Weili, in Zhongshan city.
Weili is China's largest producer of washing machines - making some 1.3m
units in 1992, or twice as many as its nearest competitor - and has a market
share of 25 per cent nation-wide. As Mr Hou noted, 'we bought one of the
best production lines - and the product is good.'
As for the future, GI has its eye on infrastructure development in energy
and transportation. Its chairman, Mr He Keqin, said recently that it planned
investments in power generation and road and bridge construction.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Hong Kong (4): Cautious hopes for big economic
rewards - Alain Cass examines Hong Kong's growing integration with China's
economy. Uncertainties are many and the stakes are high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAIN CASS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA calls Hong Kong's transition to 1997 the 'through-train.' There are
few illusions in the colony about this journey into the unknown. Some
freedoms will go, if not overnight, then gradually.
The hope to which Hong Kong's workaholic business community clings is that
its no-holds-barred freedom to trade will not be among them.
This could be wishful thinking. The argument that, to sustain an open
economy in the long run you need a free flow of information, if not free
speech, is powerful and seductive, not least because of the poignancy of
Hong Kong's situation.
But things may not be as bleak as they seem on the surface - for two
reasons. The first is that a number of economies in the region have
flourished without democracy - Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea to name but
three. In the case of the last two, economic prosperity has smoothed the way
for a gradual change from martial law to a semblance of free elections.
The second reason for cautious optimism is that the Chinese are embracing
capitalism with evangelical fervour. Money is softening up the communist
party and Hong Kong is thriving on the back of this get-rich-quick culture.
It is one the great ironies of history that refugees who fled Mao Zedong's
prison camps after the communist take-over in 1949 now ebb and flow across
the border in their thousands, cutting deals with his successors. In his
inaugural address, Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's new governor, spoke of an
economic revolution, not seen since the industrialisation of Europe and
America, sweeping the region and carrying Hong Kong with it. Mr Hamish
Macleod, the colony's financial secretary, refers to growth in southern
China's ultra-liberated provinces as 'astonishing.'
Granted, these are worried men with a vested interest in talking up the
region's economic prospects. But the figures, even allowing for a healthy
margin of error, suggest the dreaded take-over may not be all bad or all
one-way:
Hong Kong-based businesses and their mainland partners now employ three
million people in over 25,000 factories in southern China. This vast
off-shore force of cheap labour is bigger than the colony's own working
population which is increasingly employed in the services sector. In a
recent survey, 70 per cent of the colony's electronics manufacturers said
they had invested in China.
An estimated 30 per cent of Hong Kong's total note and coin issue circulates
in southern China - about twice the amount of 18 months ago. Taxi drivers in
Shenzen, just across the border, accept Hong Kong dollars. Gold shops in the
colony will take Chinese currency.
China's economy grew by 12 per cent in real terms in 1992 and is forecast to
grow by at least 7 and 8 per cent this year, and possibly more. Southern
China will almost certainly vastly outpace the national average. This growth
has had a dramatic effect on Hong Kong. It is now the mainland's biggest
trading partner. China, in turn, is Hong Kong's best overseas customer,
pushing even the mighty US into second place.
Total contracted foreign investment in China by September 1992 was USDollars
78.6bn of which just over USDollars 25bn had been realised. Hong Kong
accounts for around two-thirds of that total, more in the south of the
country.
Hong Kong has become a significant market for capital flowing in and out of
mainland China. By the end of the decade, by some estimates, China-related
listings in the Hong Kong market will account for 45 per cent of its
capitalisation or as much as USDollars 900bn, up from USDollars 175bn in
1992.
For the sceptics who doubt these figures, there is the evidence of their own
eyes. The Pearl river delta is like a giagantic game of Monopoly, sprouting
factories, apartments and office towers. More than 18,000 trucks a day leave
Hong Kong's container port - the world's biggest - for China. Seven years
ago less than 12 per cent of the port's trade was with China. Last year it
reached 65 per cent and the proportion is still growing.
As one analyst put it, '1997 has already happened - it's just that the
politicians haven't noticed.'
Hong Kong's growing integration with the Chinese economy offers the prospect
of huge rewards. If the 'China Express' powers ahead, Hong Kong will
continue to ride high.
But growing dependence on China also carries some risks. Runaway inflation
and rampant corruption could drive the Chinese economy off the rails,
triggering social unrest, as happened in 1989, in which case Hong Kong would
be in for a rough ride.
CHINA is now in its third go-stop cycle since 1979, when Deng Xiaoping
abandoned the command economy. Inflation is running well into double-digit
figures - some say running away altogether. The widely-used unofficial rate
for the renminbi has fallen sharply. Rivalry between the centre and the
richer provinces could grow as these become economically more powerful and
demand greater autonomy. Inequalities of wealth could - almost certainly
will - lead to renewed social unrest sometime in the future.
There is already talk of the leadership tightening monetary policy again to
slow the rate of growth. A credit crunch in China would hit the colony hard.
Property developers hoping to cash in on China's chronic shortage of urban
housing, now that 1980's construction boom in Hong Kong is effectively over,
would suffer. So would its manufacturers of consumer goods.
Failure by the President Bill Clinton's administration to renew China's Most
Favoured Nation (MFN) status in June would slash growth in Hong Kong, which
is why Mr Patten will argue unconditionally for its renewal when he goes to
Washington. The colony's worst nightmare is a faltering US recovery, a
credit crunch in China and a suspension of Peking's MFN status.
The government hopes that at least two of these will not materialise. It
forecasts real GDP growth of 5.5 per cent this year, incidentally,
overtaking the UK in per capita terms. Despite objections from Beijing, or
perhaps because of them, the government is rushing to put in place as much
of the planned infrastructure as possible before 1997, using its substantial
reserves instead of resorting to tax increases. Domestic inflation is a
worry. This has fallen from its peak of nearly 14 per cent in 1991, but it
remains over 10 per cent which, the government concedes, is uncomfortable
high.
The Hong Kong dollar's fixed link with its US counterpart may anchor the
economy and keep it externally competitive, but it also hobbles the fight
against inflation by limiting the government's use of the interest rate
weapon.
For the past 10 years the currency's rate has been fixed at HKDollars 7.8 to
the USDollars . The territory's interest rates track US rates. These have
been low to boost America's anaemic economy. The effect on Hong Kong of low
interest rates has been to fuel stock and property market speculation,
boosting asset prices and inflation.
The expansionary budget, introduced by Mr Patten in February, has been
criticised for promoting inflation. Some economists, notably Mr John
Greenwood, chairman of GT Management, who fathered the link with the US
dollar, says high growth and the fixed exchange rate will save Hong Kong
from conventional inflation-sickness.
Nevertheless, soaring land and labour costs and the difficulty of recruiting
skilled labour to Hong Kong is driving some back-office services not just
across the border into China but elsewhere in the region. Cathay Pacific,
the colony's flagship airline, plans to set up an accountancy centre in
Guangzhou and a database in Australia to capitalise on cheap labour and
land.
The relentless migration of Hong Kong's young, middle-class professionals
ahead of 1997 chips away at its competitive edge. They are leaving at the
rate of 60,000 a year or nearly one per cent of a population which is barely
growing and getting older. Unless Hong Kong can find a way of replacing them
and developing its 'intelligent' core, it could find itself with a
manufacturing base largely in China and its high-value services dribbling
away to up-and-coming regional hubs.
In the long-run there is always the possibility of a sudden and
unpredictable lurch back to Mao's economics in China by a communist party
fearing loss of power and a Soviet-style break-up of the country. But the
risk of that happening decreases as the power of the Chinese consumer grows.
Ultimately the best - the only - guarantee of Hong Kong's economic survival
is for China's stake in the colony to become so big and the number of
officials who might wish to slam shut the open-door so outnumbered by those
who want to make money, that nothing else makes sense.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Hong Kong (5): Airport plans at crucial stage -
Wrangles continue over new Pounds 13bn airport and Pounds 1bn container
terminal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAIN CASS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPTAIN Charles Elliot, the British naval officer who claimed Hong Kong for
the British crown in 1841 might, if he still takes an interest in its
affairs, allow himself a wry smile as he watches over his progeny.
His judgement about the territory, which Lord Palmerston, then Foreign
Secretary, scornfully dismissed as 'a barren island', has been vindicated.
Scores of vessels wait at anchor in the magnificent natural harbour used as
a springboard for the opium wars 150 years ago, queueing to unload their
cargo at what is now the world's busiest container terminal. Overhead, every
four minutes, a plane banks sharply over the skyscraper city, now housing
six million people, to land at Kai Tak, the world's fourth busiest airport.
Elliot might also reflect on the irony that Hong Kong's greatest physical
asset, and the reason why he picked it in the first place, could become the
last and potentially the most damaging problem in the bruising wrangle with
China ahead of the 1997 takeover.
Short of cutting off the water supply, the Chinese could hardly have picked
more vulnerable targets than Hong Kong's new Pounds 13bn airport and the
Pounds 1bn plan to extend the territory's container terminal.
Hong Kong's importance as an entrepot for the booming trade with China's
rapidly growing economy and the urgent need to relieve the pressure on Kai
Tak airport, which will be bursting at the seams by 1994 with 24m
passengers, made them obvious targets for Peking in their war against Mr
Chris Patten, the governor. They are Hong Kong's jugular.
The attempt to build the new airport on man-made Chek Lap Kok island on the
territory's south-west extremity has already claimed a number of victims
including, arguably, Lord Wilson, its originator and Mr Patten's
predecessor.
Mr John Major, the British Prime Minister, was forced to make a humiliating
trip to Peking in 1991 to clear the way for a Memorandum of Understanding
which committed China to support the so-called Airport Core Projects (ACP)
only to find it used as a weapon against him two years later.
Whether either project goes ahead now depends on the outcome of the on-off
talks between Peking, the British government and Mr Patten.
It could be argued that the new airport, to be financed half by the Hong
Kong government and half by a mixture of banks and franchise investment, has
acquired such a momentum that it cannot be stopped.
Japanese, British, US, Dutch, Belgian and Chinese companies are blasting,
shifting dirt and and dredging to create the new platform designed to take
two parallel runways, up to 375,000 aircraft movements and nearly 90m
passengers a year by 2040. The design for the airport terminal by a mostly
British consortium is well advanced. Contracts for the terminal could be
awarded within months.
THE related parts of this monumental plan, thrown together as a confidence
booster after the Tiananmen Square massacre - a viaduct, two suspension
bridges, an undersea tunnel, a railway, a new town and a highway to the
Chinese border - will be largely funded by the government.
But unless Britain and China can agree new terms, two key parts of the core
project - the airport itself and its connecting railway - cannot go ahead:
The Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) may run out of money by the summer.
If the Legislative Council, the local law-making body, refuses to vote it
more money salaries could not be paid.
The international banking community could hardly be expected to come with
the required loans even though, in the long-run, the new airport will be a
money-spinner. If there were an agreement, however, the PAA could expect a
rush of loan offers on extremely favourable terms. Although of less
magnitude than the airport, the delay to building the four-berth Container
terminal 9(CT9) at Kwai Chung, poses a more immediate practical problem.
Gouged out of the sea on what was known as Gin Drinker's Bay, Hong Kong's
container port is the bridgehead for goods moving in and out of China. The
decision to award the contract for CT9 was arrived at after much wrangling
and provoked bitter recrimination among the losing bidders.
The winning consortium, headed by Hong Kong International Terminals and
Modern Terminals (HIT) in one group, and Jardines and Sea-Land in another,
are now faced with the choice of pressing on without agreement from Peking
or biding their time.
Both courses of action pose significant problems. If the developers decide
to try to press on, there must be a doubt over whether they can take the
banks with them. If the HIT consortium decides to bide its time, the
pressure of traffic on its existing terminals - which grew at 17 per cent in
1992 - could become unbearable.
The fact that there is a heavy mainland Chinese involvement in both
consortia could complicate matters.
There have already been hints that, unless matters are resolved, it may
shelve or even abandon its plans for CT9 and look to China for its next
development.
'With costs escalating in Hong Kong,' said one executive, 'this would make
sense.'
Like so much else in Hong Kong, this could be an astute piece of pressure
aimed at bringing Hong Kong and China to their senses. Both China and Hong
Kong stand to lose a great deal if either project falls through. Of the two,
however, there little doubt about who stands to lose most.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Flanders (7): Backlash against traditional parties
 -A variety of protest votes in 1991 sent shock waves through Flanders
politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICALLY, the last 18 months have been difficult for Flanders. When
Belgium went to the polls in November 1991, it was the northern part of the
country which suffered most from the backlash against traditional political
parties.
Vlaams Blok, a right-wing extremist party dedicated to the expulsion of
immigrants from Flanders, won 10.4 per cent of the regional vote - 25 per
cent in Antwerp - and more seats in the Flemish (and Belgian) parliaments
than the moderate Flemish nationalist party, the Volksunie.
Each of the dominant parties in Flanders, the Christian Democrats and
Socialists, saw support slip by more than 4 per cent. For good measure, an
anti-political party headed by maverick millionaire Jean-Pierre Van Rossem,
came from nowhere to capture 5.2 per cent of the vote and four seats on the
Flemish regional council. The shock result was not confined to the north,
but according to the caricature outsiders' view of Belgium (a country split
into two or more regions, Yugoslav-style, by absurd linguistic struggles and
dangerous extremism) Flanders was the real villain of the piece.
But at the same time, Flanders - with its increasing economic strength and
historic sense of identity - is well-placed to gain from constitutional
reforms edging their way through the Belgian parliament which devolve more
powers to the regions.
The question for traditional parties is how to take advantage of those
reforms without encouraging extreme Flemish nationalism which would further
tarnish the region's political reputation, particularly outside Belgium.
In opposition, the liberal PVV, headed by neo-Thatcherite Guy Verhofstadt,
has taken the most drastic step. In November last year it turned itself into
a new party, the VLD (liberal democrats), which is set to become the biggest
party in Flanders and Belgium.
The PVV was the only traditional party to gain votes in Flanders at the
election. Verhofstadt also cannily decided not to participate in the Flemish
government coalition, formed in February 1992 out of socialists and
Christian Democrats. It turned out to be shrewd move. An opinion poll
published at the end of last year in La Libre Belgique, one of Belgium's
francophone daily newspapers, indicated that the VLD was the most popular
party in Flanders, with a rating of 26.1 per cent, against 22.3 per cent for
the CVP.
Verhofstadt says he and his liberal colleagues were motivated to form the
VLD - a party for the citizen - when they realised that Belgium's
traditional ruling parties appeared to be taking little notice of the
popular 'protest vote' in the November 1991 poll. 'A million people voted
for extremist parties, and anti-political parties, and yet we've only
changed the prime minister and the (national) coalition is continuing with
the same policy,' he says.
The governing coalition in Flanders has taken a different tack. Inspired by
Luc Van den Brande, its Christian Democrat leader, the Flemish government
published in March a lengthy strategy document, Flanders-Europe 2002.
Van den Brande says the Flemish government wanted to encourage the people of
Flanders to abandon selfish short-termism and look to the future.
Concentrating on seven areas of strategy - from culture and employment
through to transport, education and housing - the document is an ambitious
attempt to lay out broad policy lines for the next decade.
On constitutional reforms, both Verhofstadt and Van den Brande agree that
they are only the most recent stage in a longer process which began over 20
years ago. 'This is an important step, and we should try to implement it
properly,' says Van den Brande, 'but it isn't the last step.'
Flanders has already achieved much autonomy through previous state reforms.
The region also has an advantage over its Walloon neighbour in that the
Flemish regional council and the Dutch-speaking community council have
merged into a single body, the Flemish council.
The Flemish government controls environment, housing, and energy policy,
industrial economic strategy, public works and transport, as well as
education, culture and welfare policy. This year's reform adds agriculture
and foreign trade to those powers.
It also provides for a directly elected Flemish parliament - in the current
system, national deputies also sit in the regional and community councils.
If there is a further round of constitutional reforms, most Flemish
politicians would like to see greater devolution of financial and fiscal
responsibility to Flanders, instead of the region having to rely on
donations from the central treasury.
Flemings also continually stress the need for a more 'balanced' approach to
welfare payments. At the moment social security is still managed by the
central state, but the wealthier residents of Flanders claim they are
underwriting social security payments to jobless Walloons.
It is probably still too soon for the angry political debate to become a
serious proposal for reform, but as one Flemish economist points out, the
devolution of education policy to the regions was an equally explosive issue
in the 1980s, but 'now it's regionalised and everyone is more or less happy
with it'.
How likely is it, then, that this gradual reform will end in a separatist
solution to Belgium's complex political problems, with Flanders, Wallonia
and Brussels - which is a region in its own right - going their own way?
Politicians from the Socialist, Christian Democrat and Liberal Democrat
parties in Flanders are in accord on this point. Most Flemings do not want
to cut themselves off from their southern neighbours, say the politicians,
but they do want a 'fair, federalist solution,' for practical as much as
sentimental reasons, based on dialogue between regions and communities.
It sounds like common sense. But in practice, all Belgian politicians like
to keep a little separatist rhetoric up their sleeves, just in case dialogue
turns into confrontation, as it often has in the past.
In addition, neither Flanders nor Wallonia is a static political entity,
waiting for reform to happen. Both are hyperactive self-promoters, pinning
their hopes on a role for the regions within Europe, rather than clinging on
to the apron-strings of Mother Belgium.
Mr Van den Brande, for example, has already published a strategy document
which lays out a Flemish 'foreign policy', ahead of the latest reforms,
which give the regions the ability to sign international treaties in their
own policy areas.
In this international public relations battle, the success of extremists in
the 1991 election was a clear setback for Flanders. Next year's municipal
elections in Antwerp and other cities may indicate the extent to which the
extremist vote was merely a symptom of wider popular disgruntlement.
In the meantime, the more moderate politicians in Flanders can only hope
that renewed Flemish pride will manifest itself in an outward-looking,
entrepreneurial spirit, rather than in unattractive, inward-looking
nationalism.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Flanders (9): Smart in every sense - Guy
Verhofstadt leads a fast-growing political party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUY Verhofstadt, leader and architect of the VLD, Belgium's newest and
fastest growing political party, is young and sharp-suited. He is, in every
sense, a smart politician.
The Flemish liberal party (PVV) he headed was one of the only established
political parties to gain parliamentary seats at Belgium's last election, in
November 1991. At that election, voters demonstrated their disgust for the
machinations of traditional party politics in Belgium by backing extremist,
green and anti-political parties.
In the chaotic aftermath, Mr Verhofstadt realised that the PVV would have to
do more than rest on its laurels. 'We analysed the political situation in
the country and decided it was necessary to build up what we call a
democratic alternative to the present government,' he says.
The result was the Flemish liberal democrat party (VLD) - 'Partij van de
Burger' the party of the citizen - which was born almost exactly a year
after the election. One of its aims is to break the stranglehold which, Mr
Verhofstadt says, pressure groups - notably the unions - have over the
Flemish and French-speaking Christian Democrat and socialist parties which
form the current coalition.
Other goals include cutting expenditure without raising taxes, encouraging
Belgians to invest some of their extensive savings to help growth, and
capping wage increases.
The similarities with the radical conservatism of Mrs Margaret Thatcher are
not coincidental. Since the late 1970s the PVV had been a zealous backer of
the free market, and Verhofstadt, who took over as leader in 1982, was a
keen follower of Thatcherite and Reaganite principles. He is still a regular
visitor to the free-market Adam Smith Institute in the UK; he says the VLD
has taken on some of those traits, adapting them to the Belgian system and
adjusting them to take into account the mistakes which both Thatcher and
Reagan made.
The VLD started with an advantage in the opinion polls over the Flemish
Christian Democrats (CVP). Mr Verhofstadt says it has been adding new
members from across the political spectrum, including many who have never
before been involved in politics.
The confidence of the new party and its leader is unquestioned. When
Belgium's centre-left government was teetering on the brink of collapse in
March, Guy Verhofstadt was not afraid to call for immediate elections,
despite the risk that a new poll would simply aggravate the electorate's
disgruntlement with traditional politics.
Whether the VLD can go on building on its strong foundations depends to a
large extent on Verhofstadt himself, who finds himself on the right of the
party he has helped to create. Just turned 40, a lawyer by training, he
already has a ministerial career on his curriculum vitae: he was a tough
budget minister and vice-premier between 1985 and 1988.
But some say Verhofstadt is too tough, and are critical of his autocratic
management style. He was one of the senior Belgian politicians asked by the
King to forge a coalition after the 1991 election. His reluctance to
compromise - a serious flaw in the Byzantine world of Belgian politics - was
one reason why he failed.
Verhofstadt himself is not a separatist, although he says there is a risk
that the country will split if Belgium's regions are not given more fiscal
and financial autonomy - a central plank of the VLD manifesto.
But he sees his own political future as a national rather than a regional
deputy. The VLD's policy is founded on a rigorous economic programme, and,
as he points out, 'the economy, fiscal policy, and European economic and
monetary union are all problems discussed at federal, not regional level'.
If he mellows enough to become a prime minister, it will probably be of
Belgium rather than Flanders.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Flanders (8): Ideas spark in smoke - The
minister-president is a soccer-loving democrat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE minister-president of the Flemish government since January 1992 is -
like Belgium's prime minister, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene - a soccer-loving
Christian Democrat.
But where Mr Dehaene has dominated the headlines since taking over at the
head of the national government in March 1992, Mr Luc Van den Brande
appeared to be making little impact at the head of the Flemish government
until early this year.
People wondered why the workaholic former minister for unemployment and
labour, who only stopped generating ideas when he was lighting another
cigarette, was still in the shadow of his Walloon counterpart, Mr Guy
Spitaels.
The answer seems to be that he was busy generating ideas, but waiting for
the right moment to unleash them
In January Mr Van den Brande turned up the heat in the debate over
constitutional reform by telling a Francophone newspaper that he saw the
reforms as a stepping stone to a 'confederal' Belgium, in which the state
would act as a mere go-between for the regions.
His comments were immediately interpreted by anxious Walloons as a thinly
veiled call for Flemish independence. When, in March, the Flemish
minister-president launched the project 'Vlaanderen-Europa 2002' - an
ambitious strategy paper for the development of 'a new Flanders in Europe' -
it was taken as further evidence of the radicalisation of Luc Van den
Brande.
The 47-year-old lawyer is no nationalist firebrand. Directly elected
regional parliaments, increased autonomy - especially the ability to sign
treaties with other countries - and more fiscal and financial responsibility
for the regions, are the key aspects of the latest reform programme as far
as he is concerned.
Like Dehaene, he welcomes the fact that constitutional reform in Belgium has
been 'a democratic evolution' rather than a revolution. But he firmly
believes that evolution has not yet stopped.
'I never said we intended to have a fully independent Flanders, according to
international law,' he protests, evidently fed up with questions about his
confederalist ambitions, but he adds: 'By the end of this century, the most
important decision-making powers will be the Flemish and Walloon
governments.'
By then, Mr Van den Brande forecasts there will be three essential
decision-making levels within the European Community: local authorities, the
regions, and Europe itself. Belgium will remain, but mainly as a
co-ordinator of European affairs, economic and monetary policy, justice and
defence responsibilities. 'I'm convinced that 80 to 85 per cent of the
Flemings want to do things together with the Walloon part of the country,'
he says, 'but based on their own powers, fiscal and financial
responsibilities.'
Since January he has not been slow to assert these points, looking beyond
the immediate political and economic situation to what the future might
hold.
The Flanders-Europe project is supposed to galvanise the rest of the Flemish
population in the same way. 'It's not always clear to Flemings that they
must have a broader view and long-term strategy.'
Mr Van den Brande has hedged his bets somewhat by making clear that
Flanders-Europe is merely a discussion document to be fleshed out through
debate across Flanders and beyond. But whether down-to-earth Flemings will
go along with this long-term vision remains to be seen. Many, it seems,
would prefer him to devote his energies to short-term economic problems.
As for the French speakers, they cannot decide whether Luc Van den Brande is
a lightweight political opportunist or a dangerous visionary.
The Walloons are well aware that 2002 is not only the 10th anniversary of
the single European market and Maastricht - the point Mr Van den Brande
tends to stress. It is also the 700th anniversary of the Battle of the
Golden Spurs, at which the ordinary townspeople of Flanders soundly defeated
the French.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Flanders (10): Petty feuding stops here - Andrew
Hill reports that beer bridges the linguistic divide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THERE is one element of Belgian culture which bridges the linguistic rift
between Flemings and Walloons, apart from the royal family, it may be beer.
In fact, some 80 per cent of Belgium's 120 or so breweries are in Flanders.
Gambrinus, the 'King of Beer', may have been a 13th century Duke of Brabant,
Louvain and Antwerp, and one of the patron saints of beer is St Arnoldus - a
Fleming.
But there is only one Belgian Brewers' Confederation and so far nobody has
tried to split it down the middle. Beer, it seems, is above such petty
feuds.
In any case, it would be very difficult to divide Belgian beers,
geographically or by nationality.
Grimbergen, for example, is an abbey north of Brussels, well inside
Flanders. But the fruity beer for which it is famous is now brewed by
Alken-Maes, one of Belgium's two big brewers, near Charleroi, in Wallonia.
Alken-Maes is responsible for the eponymous Belgian pils, Maes, and the
'European' lager Kronenbourg, and has its headquarters in Flanders, but last
year BSN, the French food group, increased its stake in the company to 75
per cent. Interbrew, meanwhile, owner of the Stella Artois and Jupiler, is
still family controlled, and has its roots in Leuven, Flanders. But its
outlook is international, and its interim managing director is a Frenchman.
In any other sector, such developments would arouse the latent fears of
Flemings - and Walloons - that a great national industry is coming under the
thumb of foreigners. But although 80 per cent of the Belgian market is
controlled by these two giants, they know better than to dilute the great
strength of Belgian beer - its local variety.
They have learned their lesson from the classic riches-to-rags-to-riches
tale is of white beer - a cloudy, refreshing brew which almost died out in
the 1950s as small specialist brews were being driven out of the market.
Family brewers in the small Flemish town of Hoegaarden revived the beer in a
fit of nostalgia in the mid-1960s, and it quickly took off. Such was its
success that the Hoegaarden brewery has since been bought out by Interbrew,
which has even begun production of white beer as far away as Texas, and
there are now a dozen white beers on the market.
In a world preoccupied with tradition, it would clearly be commercial death
to try to homogenise Belgian beer. In the late 1980s, Interbrew even had to
change the image of Stella Artois - a relatively ordinary beer by the
standards of some of Belgium's more exotic brews - to revitalise its home
market, by emphasising the beer's roots in the country's great brewing
traditions.
With demand in Belgium shrinking, export of specialist brews is now the best
way for many Belgian brewers to keep going, according to Jan De Brabanter of
the Belgian Brewers' Confederation. 'In Spain, for example, Belgian beers
aren't considered as competitors (of local beers), but as a way of
reactivating a beer culture,' he says. '(Diversity) is our main fame. That's
why specialist beers are so important to us, and why the Belgian beer
economy isn't going to shrink to just a few big brewers. There really is a
future even for the very small.'
The promotion of specialist beers is also the best way for the industry to
protect itself from the criticisms of the anti-alcohol lobby, according to
Mr De Brabanter. That is the thought behind the slogan the brewers have
devised for future advertising campaigns: 'A beer brewed with love is always
drunk in the right spirit' - one reason, at least, for glancing at the menu
next time you're in a Brussels cafe and seeking out a Hoegaarden, a De
Koninck or a Duvel, rather than a simple Stella or Maes.
As Michael Jackson advises in his seminal work The Great Beers of Belgium:
'Never simply ask for 'a beer' in Belgium.'

FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Hong Kong (2): 'LegCo' shows newfound
assertiveness - Political scene, changing role for Hong Kong's Legislative
Council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the central business district on Hong Kong island, lying diagonally
between the Hong Kong Club and Hongkong Bank - arguably two of the colony's
most powerful institutions - is a fine example of late colonial architecture
in the classical vein.
Once the colony's High Court, today it is occupied by Hong Kong's
Legislative Council (LegCo), its law-making body, and an institution which
is trying to match the power of its neighbours. For most of its near
150-year history, LegCo was a sleepy organ of British colonial power, the
epitome of rule by bureaucrat and plutocrat. It was an institution where the
government held sway both through its own 'official' members and by its
ability to appoint Hong Kong's great and good to the assembly. The advent of
elections in 1984, covering a restricted franchise known as 'functional
constituencies,' began to change that. Arguably, however, the biggest
changes to LegCo - and the ones with which the Hong Kong government, China
and Britain, are still trying coming to terms - occurred in 1990 and 1991.
In 1990, LegCo rejected and Anglo-Chinese agreement concerning the Court of
Final Appeal - the court which, post-1997, is meant to be Hong Kong's
highest appellate court. Then, in 1991, Britain and China allowed the people
of Hong Kong to elect, through universal suffrage, 18 members to the
60-strong council. 'The Court of Final Appeal was something of a watershed,'
said a British Foreign Office official. 'We found that we had a LegCo that
was not grateful for all our efforts - which we believed had been
considerable - but, on the contrary, thought that the agreement we struck
with Beijing was poor, and asked why they had not been consulted.'
The advent of democratic elections was no less significant. It brought, for
the first time, a populism to Hong Kong politics which the colony had never
seen before; it also brought social issues - housing, education, the
environment, and the like - to the forefront of debate in the colony's
community.
What both developments have underlined is that, unlike before, LegCo cannot
be taken for granted. Mr Hamish Mcleod, the colony's financial secretary,
was strongly reminded of this a year ago when he nearly had his budget
thrown back at him. This time around, Mr Mcleod consulted widely with
individual members and groups in LegCo - throwing money at members' pet
projects - and his budget was passed virtually without complaint.
Since then, LegCo has humiliated the government over its mismanagement of
the construction of a new science and technology university - its cost rose
to HKDollars 3.4bn from an estimated HKDollars 1.9bn - and its, and the
British government's, attitude to the nationality of non-Chinese Asians in
the colony. Yet for all its newfound assertiveness, LegCo remains a curious
institution. Its proceedings resemble more the decorous ways of the House of
Lords rather than the rowdiness of the House of Commons. And, like the Lords
it is essentially a chamber of review, not one which forms the government.
To some this is a cause of some regret. Mr Andrew Wong, one of the 18
democratically-elected members of LegCo and an independent democrat, says
that LegCo has been harmed by the growth of party and faction which has come
in the wake of elections.
'The old role has continued, not to govern but to criticise and seek changes
to policy,' he says. 'But with the formation of parties, when one group
criticises something, they all do. We all are critics, with no governing
power and that's the problem. What we need in LegCo is a governing party and
an opposition.'
Mr Wong readily concedes that this is not a realistic prospect. China, for
one, would not permit it. Its aim, say local politicians, is a LegCo on the
old British colonial model - one consisting of 'lackeys.' China has watched,
with growing alarm, LegCo's flexing of muscles. In spite of the anti-British
rhetoric which is published daily in the pro-communist media in Hong Kong,
Beijing has no interest in seeing LegCo, a colonial institution par
excellence, scoring victories over the executive branch of government. In
last year's debate about Mr Mcleod's budget, it instructed its supporters in
LegCo to abstain - thereby affording Mr Mcleod the majority he need to get
his budget passed.
China wants the executive branch to remain all powerful; its fear of
pluralism, even in Hong Kong's tiny community of six million, is one of the
reasons why it agreed to talk to Britain about Governor Chris Patten's
proposals for more democracy in Hong Kong. At bottom, say government
officials, what China wants is an election in 1995 the result of which is
the fewest possible dissenting voices.
China failed to get very many of its supporters into LegCo through the 1991
polls. It hopes that after talks with Britain it can so arrange the playing
field that its supporters have less difficulty being elected in 1995. But
Beijing is taking no chances.
It has put up candidates for election to six seats on the Hong Kong General
Chamber of Commerce's board. The Chamber's members return one councillor to
LegCo, and China hopes that by winning control of the board that it can
influence the outcome of the 1995 election for the Chamber's seat. Its
current sitting member, Mr Jimmy McGregor, won in 1991 in one of the few
contested elections for a 'functional constituencies.' His main supporters,
he says, were small and medium-sized Chinese businesses.
Mr McGregor believes there have been substantial positive changes to the
work of LegCo since the introduction of elections - 'the examination of
public policy is a lot more thorough than before,' he says. 'The balance
between economic and social interests is much better now and that is because
of the strong representation of Hong Kong people in LegCo.'
These changes have also had an impact on the way companies deal with
government and the legislature. With greater publicity given to councillors'
views in the press, companies are making an effort to keep LegCo abreast of
their business.
'Interest and pressure groups in Hong Kong have become easier to identify,'
says an executive with a leading utility. 'LegCo members are beginning to
specialise - and we want them to have a good understanding of our business
because they will decide how we are regulated.'
LegCo's frequent challenges to the government to provide more information
about policy, and to be open to the legislature's advice during policy
formulation, have won plaudits from the local community. Hong Kong may not
have turned out in droves to participate in the 1991 elections, but there
can be little doubt that it likes the result.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Flanders (5): Astronaut ambassador - High
technology is on a high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN MARCH 1992, when Dr Dirk Frimout became Belgium's first astronaut since
Tintin, the whole country was enthralled - and Flanders was over the moon.
Dr Frimout is a Fleming, from the small village of Poperinge. As such, he is
the ideal symbol of Flanders' desire to make a name for itself as a centre
for high technology.
The Flanders Technology International Foundation was quick to name the
Belgian astronaut as its first 'ambassador' - an accolade created for people
deemed to have advanced or promoted science and technology.
With or without Dr Frimout, the FTI Foundation is on a high. It runs the
biannual Flanders Technology International fair, which takes place in Ghent
this week, and is celebrating its 10th anniversary.
Mr Erik Jacquemyn, managing director of the foundation, says it is no
coincidence that Flanders is holding what it claims is the biggest and best
attended technology fair in Europe. 'There's a natural atmosphere of
creativity towards research and technology within Flanders, which makes it
an obvious venue.'
In fact, the focus on technological development in Flanders is relatively
recent. It is also politically motivated. When the modern government of
Flanders was set up in 1980, Mr Gaston Geens, the chief minister, framed a
regional economic policy which set out to renew the old industrial base of
the region by introducing new technologies into the production process.
Flanders Technology International was one way of encouraging the exchange of
information.
The success of that policy is relatively difficult to enumerate. But
according to a study by the Flemish Foundation of Technology Assessment,
nearly all companies in Flanders now have a totally or partially automated
production process. Some 17 per cent of large Flemish companies and 7 per
cent of small companies use robots or automatons. 'That seems to me very
solid proof that this action has been successful in the 1980s,' says Mr Luc
Van den Brande, Mr Geens' successor, when he launched this year's technology
fair in March.
Mr Jacquemyn is adamant that Flanders Technology International is not a
'trade fair' like the much larger annual exhibition in Hannover, for
example. 'These fairs say, 'Let's bring together as many visitors and
exhibitors as we can and let them buy from one another.' We're completely
different. We try to confront people who are active in technology with other
solutions in other fields.'
Faithful exhibitors agree that their main purpose in attending the FTI is
not to sell products, but to make contact with other innovators. Mr Jeff
Vanwildemeersch is marketing director of Pauwels International, a Flemish
manufacturer of electrical transformers which has had a stand at all six
fairs since 1983.
He says it is still a general showcase for Flemish technology, but he
wonders how many companies demonstrate their most innovative technologies in
such a hothouse atmosphere. 'I would personally give a press conference (on
a new technology) a fortnight after the fair, because otherwise people lose
interest amid all the background noise (from other technology launches),' he
says.
Mr Vanwildemeersch also suggests that, after 10 years, it might be worth
rethinking the aim of the fair: 'If we want to sell products we have fairs
that meet our needs, and there are specific events for our sector. This is
more of a general show, with no specific focus.'
To an extent, the FTI foundation is already working on giving the event a
sharper focus. This year, the emphasis is less on the size of an exhibitor's
stand than on the quality and depth of the research displayed.
With the same objective in mind, the number of days when the fair is open to
the general public has been cut this year from three to two. 'It's moving
further in the direction of professionalism and innovation,' says Mr
Jacquemyn. Or, as Mr Van den Brande put it in his launch address: 'The
mega-event of the 1980s has been replaced by a niche-event which
concentrates on innovations and quality products.'
At the time of writing, with some potential participants still to be
assessed by the FTI's committee of experts, it already looked as though the
number of genuine 'innovations' likely to be displayed this year had risen
from 144 in 1989 to more than 250, in spite of the fact that the number of
exhibitors has dropped.
In addition, the Foundation has given this year's FTI a new structure.
Exhibitors have been asked to choose between four colour-coded areas of
specialisation: nature (biotechnology, energy and environmental technology);
matter (advanced materials, production and transport technology); data; and
'know-how', including research, engineering and software.
Mr Jacquemyn says this year's FTI will be 'four specialised fairs in four
non-competing areas, under one roof.' He believes Flemish companies will be
demonstrating their strength particularly in the data section, with displays
of microelectronics, telecommunications and speech technology. But he is
also eager to stress the international aspect of the exhibition, at which
nearly a third of participants were non-Belgian in 1991.
For the last three fairs, Wallonia cannily opted to participate in the FTI
as a region. To the irritation of some Flemish exhibitors, that meant it was
granted a separate distinctive showcase, while Flanders technology was
dispersed through the whole event.
This year, however, the Walloon regional government is trying to organise
its own fair, in competition with the FTI. Mr Jacquemyn is clearly
flattered, but he is sceptical about Wallonia's chances of matching the
FTI's success.
'It's pretty difficult to jump on to a train which is already running at
high speed,' he says, smiling.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Flanders (3): Most companies depend on exports -
Andrew Hill reports that Flanders has moved away from dependence on
agriculture and textiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG and open economy has always formed the foundations of Flemish pride
 -in the middle ages, for example, when Bruges, Ypres and Ghent built their
prosperity on wool, and again in the 16th and 17th centuries, when the city
of Antwerp was a thriving mercantile centre.
The resurgence of the Flemish economy since the mid-1960s, when per capita
income in Flanders overtook Wallonia, has given the whole region a
psychological boost.
Flanders has moved away from dependence on agriculture and textiles; it has
developed late 20th century industrial assets in sectors such as chemicals,
car assembly, metals, food processing, machinery and high technology.
Gross regional product in Flanders in 1988 (the last time it was calculated)
represented nearly 60 per cent of Belgium's gross domestic product.
But the very openness which has characterised the Flemish economy, is now
taking its toll on a region which exports 75 per cent of its production, and
accounts for more than 70 per cent of Belgium's total exports. Sales into
Germany, Flanders' biggest trading partner, have dropped in absolute terms
by 5 per cent over the last year.
A global slump is doubly unkind to the Flemish economy, and particularly its
dominant industrial groups.
Not only are most of Flanders' companies - and, of course, its ports -
dependent on export business, many of those companies are themselves
foreign-owned.
With the outlook grim on their home territory, investment by Flanders'
biggest employers - Volvo, Ford, Volkswagen, BASF, Bayer, Monsanto, Alcatel,
IBM, to name just a few - has slowed down, and new investment by foreigners
is deterred by gloomy forecasts of Belgian wage costs.
For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) estimates that Belgian labour costs will have grown by 38 per cent
between 1988 and 1994, against 18 per cent in the US. More damagingly for
Flanders, wage costs in neighbouring France and the Netherlands are expected
to grow by only 30 per cent and 28 per cent respectively.
'There's much more investment in southern Europe and eastern Europe now,'
laments Mr Wim Van der Beken of the Flemish Employers Association (VEV).
The result is an unaccustomed surge in unemployment. In the 1980s Flemish
unemployment dropped sharply, but since the beginning of 1992 the
unemployment rate in Flanders has increased from 8.8 per cent to 10.2 per
cent.
For once, the proportion of unemployed people in Flanders is growing faster
than in Wallonia, although the rate in the southern part of Belgium (19.4
per cent) is still much higher.
The immediate outlook is not good, but Mr Erik Buyst, an economist with
Kredietbank in Brussels, says that Flanders is well-placed to take advantage
of any improvement in the economy.
He points out that capacity utilisation in Flanders is quite high: 'That
means that if there is a big increase in demand you will need additional
investment to cope with that increase, and additional investment means new
jobs.'
Meanwhile, the recession is undermining the Flemish government's traditional
bullishness about the Flanders economy because, in spite of constitutional
reform, the main levers of economic power - monetary, financial, price and
income policy, for example - remain in the hands of central government.
Many Flemish politicians and economists hope that it will not be long before
Flanders wins responsibility for social security expenditure in Flanders -
it is a constant gripe of Flemings that they have to 'subsidise' payments to
unemployed Walloons. They are also hoping for wider fiscal and financial
autonomy including, perhaps, control over some of Belgium's looming national
debt.
However, Mr Alfons Verplaetse, governor of the Belgian National Bank and
himself a Fleming, believes this would be a step too far.
Belgium's regions have much work to do before more fundamental economic
responsibilities are split up. To illustrate the point, Mr Verplaetse cites
recent speculation against the Belgian currency, based on (misguided) fears
among foreign investors that constitutional reform would give too much
budgetary control to the regions.
'In November, for the first time, Belgium got a triple-A international
credit rating,' says Mr Verplaetse. 'I'm sure that if all the regions and
communities asked for a rating, the average wouldn't come to triple-A, even
though the debt is the same.'
For the time being, then, the Flemish government can only concentrate on
areas where it has undisputed competence.
Most importantly, that means keeping its own budget within the norms laid
out by the central government.
But it also means encouraging the industrial economy in the region, by
granting support to companies to stimulate economic expansion, renewing or
restructuring particular sectors, and easing the immediate pain of the
downturn. In the short term, for example, it was the Flemish regional
goverment, and not the Belgian government, which stumped up emergency funds
when Daf, the UK-Dutch vehicle manufacturer with a large plant in Flanders,
went into receivership in February.
In the longer term, the government aims to improve the region's
infrastructure, stimulate research and development, reduce the
administrative burden on business, and encourage 'clusters' of complementary
businesses which can help each other grow.
These are the main lines of the economic package outlined in the
government's recent strategy document for the next decade, Flanders-Europe
2002, which was launched in March.
Flemish employers like the strategy, because it at least represents an
effort to provide continuity of policy in the often turbulent world of
Belgian politics.
But they realise that for the most part they will have to rely more on their
own resources than on direct management of the most important economic
indicators by a sympathetic regional government.
That means coping with the stresses and strains of an open economy, as well
as reaping the benefits.
For example, as the European slump has closed in on Flanders, there have
been increased calls from some industrialists for a stronger emphasis on
Flemish verankering (literally 'anchoring'). Every time a foreign company
cuts jobs in a Flemish subsidiary, the feeling is reinforced that Flemish
companies should be managed from Flanders and strategic decisions with an
impact on the local economy should be kept out of the hands of foreigners.
But politically speaking, there is no acceptable way of achieving such an
objective, while simultaneously staying open for foreign investment.
Companies themselves have to do the work by encouraging the loyalty of
shareholders, and attempting to improve profitability.
As Wim Van der Beken of the VEV says, the more successful an enterprise, the
more decision-making autonomy it is likely to be given by its parents.
It is a pretty good metaphor for Flanders' political and economic aims and
the way it will try to achieve them.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Flanders (6): Network short of space - Andrew Hill
looks at transport's relation to trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIANS are oddly proud of their motorway network. At night, it is said to
be the only feature of Belgium visible from outer space.
Alas, space is exactly what Belgium's transport network is short of, and the
problem is particularly acute in Flanders. The region is home to nearly 60
per cent of the population of Belgium - not including nearly a million
inhabitants of Brussels, a separate regional 'island' within Flanders - but
accounts for only 44 per cent of the territory.
Not surprisingly, Mr Johan Sauwens, the regional communications minister,
and Mr Theo Kelchtermans, in charge of public works, have put a freeze on
new road-building. For the dominant economic region in Europe's most open
economy, that is a difficult decision. 'We're a transit economy,' says an
adviser to Mr Sauwens, 'but that shouldn't be achieved to the detriment of
the scarce remaining open space.'
Instead, the stress is laid on safety - the government wants to reduce road
accidents by 40 per cent by the year 2000 - and mobility.
For the average commuter, that means upgrading public transport in the
region's nine main urban centres to provide a viable and attractive
alternative to car travel.
For business, it means emphasising the region's extensive network of
waterways - linking to the ports of Antwerp, Ghent, Zeebrugge and Ostend -
for freight which does not need to be rushed to its destination. Mr Sauwens
hopes for a 10 per cent increase in water-borne freight traffic by the end
of the decade.
The ports are the best symbol of Flanders' openness, and the success which
it can bring. The port of Antwerp, for example, generated added value of
BFr188bn in 1990, or 3.2 per cent of Belgian GNP, in spite of the growing
crisis in the world shipping industry. The smaller port of Ghent, which
handled some 2.8m tonnes of cargo 25 years ago, now handles 23m tonnes
annually - in 1990 it generated added value for the Belgian economy of
BFr82bn.
The emphasis at both ports is on specialisation, but without losing
versatility. Antwerp, for example, has built dedicated terminals for iron
and steel trade, sugar, flour and fertilisers, fruit, liquid bulk and
non-ferrous metals. Ghent has added new products to its traditional handling
strengths, including cars, fruit juice, molasses and industrial glue.
Meanwhile, Zeebrugge, which, like neighbouring Ostend, faces a challenge to
its passenger traffic from the Channel tunnel, is constructing a new
distribution park to enhance its freight reputation.
However, Flemish ports - like the region itself - are vulnerable both to
political and commercial convulsions. Antwerp's port managers rail against
over-regulation, local or European, and all ports lament the failure to
agree a world trade deal. 'World recession, high interest rates, tensions
among the Europeans, tensions among the Europeans and Americans, difficult
talks - not to say no talks at all - at the Uruguay Round, have had negative
effects on shipping,' says Mrs Eliane Achten, chairman of the Port of
Antwerp Promotion Association.
If such shadows are lifted, politicians and ports alike hope that the
Flemish transport infrastructure - road, rail and water - will be the
vehicle for a resurgence in export-based prosperity. In the wider vision of
the Flemish free-traders, all roads lead to Flanders.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Flanders (4): Hard water problem - Eco-law needs
rationalising, says Andrew Hill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Senne is a small river with its source in Wallonia. From there, it flows
into Flanders where it becomes the Zenne, passes under Brussels - which, to
its eternal shame, built over the river around the turn of the century - and
emerges again in Flanders.
By the time it joins the much larger river Schelde - and despite having
passed through three different regional environment policies - it is heavily
polluted.
That makes the Zenne an excellent symbol for Flemish ecologists of what is
wrong with Belgium's regionalised environmental policy. 'The problem is that
the greens of Belgium are the only ones who speak to each other (about the
environment),' says Luc Barbe, a member of national and Flemish parliaments
for Flanders' green party, Agalev.
Norbert de Batselier, the Flemish minister for the environment, denies the
accusation. He says Flanders wants to consult with neighbouring authorities,
and his claims are partly borne out by recent evidence.
For example, pollution of the rivers Schelde and Meuse was one of the main
items on the agenda for the recent meeting between Luc Van den Brande, head
of the Flemish government, and Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister.
De Batselier's advisers admit to Agalev's second charge, which is that
environmental legislation in Flanders and Belgium is too complicated.
In fact, the Flemish government is trying to rationalise regional eco-law,
aiming for what one official calls a 'uniform and well-regulated legislative
instrument', including harmonised treatment of company environmental
licences, and sanctions for ecological crime. An expert committee should
come up with recommendations for harmonisation by July, but the ministry
concedes it could take another two years before any of those proposals are
enacted. 'The law is being reformed, but it's going very slowly,' says
Barbe.
De Batselier's principal operational aims are waste management, control of
water pollution - in line with EC directives on water purity - and general
conservation.
The water problem is particularly tough. The cost - particularly of bringing
sewage treatment in Flanders within EC guidelines - was originally set at
about BFr60bn two or three years ago. Advisers in the environment ministry
now reckon the total could be double that over the next 10 years.
At the same time, Flemings, like their Dutch neighbours, are having to cope
with the problem of overloaded agricultural land. Fertilisers, as well as
pig and cow manure, can pollute groundwater.
The main problem for de Batselier is that he wants to pursue a policy of
sustainable development, within an administration mainly dedicated to
encouraging the economic growth of the region. It is one of Agalev's
principal criticisms, compounded by the allegation that de Batselier's team
is short of resources.
Financially, that situation may be eased somewhat by the planned
introduction of a Belgian 'eco-tax' on certain types of packaging.
The proceeds from the tax must be used by the regions to tackle one-off
environmental problems. But as one Flemish environment official points out,
somewhat ruefully, the benefits should only be temporary: 'The chief purpose
of this tax is to discourage consumers from buying harmful packaging, and to
encourage them to switch to (untaxed) environmentally friendly products. If
that succeeds, the income from the levy will obviously decrease.'

FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Hong Kong (1): A revealing tale of three cities -
The various names used by local inhabitants and mainland Chinese to describe
Hong Kong betray contradictory perceptions which are at the heart of the
current Sino-British row about the colony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO the English-speaking world, Britain's last colony of consequence is known
as Hong Kong. To the local Chinese inhabitants the place is called Heung
Gong. And to the colony's future sovereign power it is Xiang Gang.
In a very real sense these three ways of pronouncing two Chinese characters
 -which came into usage in the 13th century and mean 'fragrant harbour' -
describe different places.
There are significant areas of overlap - especially in perceptions about
Hong Kong's role in China's modernisation drive - but the three ways of
referring to the colony betray contradictory perceptions which are at the
heart of the current Sino-British row about Hong Kong.
For Britain, at the tail end of its 150-year administration of the colony,
Hong Kong has become a symbol of honourable retreat from empire. Mr Chris
Patten, Britain's 28th, and presumably last governor, invests his task with
lofty meaning described in words of high sentence.
'I'm aware of the fact that a lot people are going to see a good deal of our
colonial history through the prism of how we manage things in Hong Kong,' he
told this newspaper last October. 'I'd like in 1997 to have been thought to
have done that job honourably and honestly. (But) I don't think it's
possible, probably, to do it in a way which has everybody cheering in the
grandstands.'
With this definition of purpose has also come a different style of
leadership, and, importantly, policy. Mr Patten has sought to redefine the
relationship Britain has with China on Hong Kong matters - to forge a basis
for dialogue built on equality.
Where, in the past, the UK was content to strike a deal on China's terms, it
has decided, at the 11th hour, to change its posture from supine to
assertive.
This is most evident in Mr Patten's attitude towards the colony's HKDollars
175bn airport and related projects - the holy grail of his predecessor's
administration - and the way in which he made proposals for Hong Kong's
political development last October 7.
Before Mr Patten arrived in July last year, his predecessor Lord Wilson, and
the Hong Kong government, were driven by the need to build the airport. Mr
Patten has moved the airport from the centre of government policy-making.
Moreover, in an attempt to make it a less valuable prize for China, he has
indicated that its completion is not something by which he, or Britain,
chooses to be judged.
'If we can't complete the airport it will be sad for Hong Kong and very sad
for China - and sad, but not tragic, for me,' he has said.
In spite of China's public position that it wants the airport built before
the Union Jack is lowered for the last time at midnight 30 June 1997, the
airport remains hostage to the outcome of Hong Kong's great political
debate. This was initiated by Mr Patten last autumn and, until 12 days ago
when Anglo/Chinese talks about his blueprint finally got underway, had
brought Anglo-Chinese relations to a virtual standstill.
By any standard, Mr Patten's proposals are modest. They provide for a more
democratic way of electing the Legislative Council (LegCo), the colony's
law-making body, not for more democracy in government as such, or even a
partially elected government. But it was the form, as much as the substance,
of what Mr Patten proposed that has so angered China's leadership. His
public announcement of the proposals ran counter to the accepted way of
doing things: in secret and producing the outcome Beijing wanted and with
which Britain could reluctantly live.
By publicising the terms of future negotiations, Mr Patten sought not only
to define and limit the scope of negotiations, but to make it difficult both
for Britain and China to produce an outcome that was too far from what he
proposed. Whether he succeeds remains to be seen.
China, for its part, has little interest in Britain's 'honourable' retreat
from Xiang Gang, except if the exit can be effected on terms beneficial to
Beijing. From Beijing's perspective, Xiang Gang is a symbol of China's past
humiliation by the west in general, and Britain in particular. It is a piece
of territory to be recovered, and recovered on terms which expunge the shame
of its original loss.
For the Chinese government, nationalism and the question of Xiang Gang have
always been related, but the recovery of the colony has taken on added
nationalistic significance. As a regime struggling to justify its
legitimacy, and one moreover which has shed much of its ideological raison
d'etre in the pursuit of staying in power, appealing to Chinese nationalism
has become a refuge in an otherwise lonely world.
In the early 1980s, China might have been prepared to back its rhetoric with
action and recover Xiang Gang as a barren rock - as some of Britain's
leading Sinologists in the early 1980s believed - but the costs of
destroying Xiang Gang today are too high, and Beijing's leadership knows it.
For that reason, it would be a mistake to see China's recovery of Xiang Gang
solely in political and nationalistic terms. Leaving aside the international
repercussions of 'sending in the army,' or 'turning off the water,' and the
effect those actions may have of Beijing's aspirations to host the Olympics
in 2000 or rejoin GATT, China has a large and growing economic interest in
the colony - as does Heung Gong in China - an interest which has limited
Beijing's room for manoeuvre in dealing with Mr Patten.
More than 60 per cent of China's trade passes through the port of Xiang Gang
and it holds about half, or USDollars 20bn, of its foreign reserves in the
colony. More importantly, the relationship between Xiang Gang and
neighbouring Guangdong province is one of symbiosis. The colony's
businessmen employ 3m in Guangdong. Destroy Xiang Gang and risk
destabilising in Guangdong, China's showcase of economic reform and the
place Deng Xiaoping, the country's frail leader, said all China should
emulate.
To that should be added China's direct financial interest in the colony. It
now openly controls companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange with an
aggregate market value of nearly HKDollars 70bn; it owns at least three per
cent of the colony's property market, a portfolio with a value of more than
HKDollars 50bn.
In addition, mainland Chinese interest control thousands of private
companies in the colony, not to mention the 'four heavenly sisters' - Bank
of China group, China Travel Service, China Merchants and China Resources.
The simple fact is that Xiang Gang is a place where mainland interests -
both state but increasingly private - like to do business. Senior Communist
Party officials can send their children to Xiang Gang where they will be
supported by any number of local tycoons anxious to ingratiate themselves
with the future landlord; they can keep their wealth in a convertible
currency; and, for a price, they can arrange for the next best thing to a US
passport, a 'green card' that will admit them and their families to the US
if the need should ever arise. In short, Xiang Gang, presents the best of
both worlds: it is Chinese, but not China.
In the middle, as has so often been the case, are the people of Heung Gong.
Just over four years away from the transfer of sovereignty they are still
uneasy and concerned about the future. Many fled communism - or are the
children of those who did so - in the aftermath of Mao Zedong's victory in
the Chinese civil war which erupted in the aftermath of World War Two and
ended with the establishment of the People's Republic of China in October
1949.
If these and the rest of Heung Gong's ordinary citizens share anything it is
the ambivalence about their present and future condition. It has become
fashionable in Heung Gong to deprecate the role of the British
administration in the colony's startling economic success in favour of Heung
Gong's 'hard working and entrepreneurial spirit.' But ask a local person in
private and he will willingly aver that without the British, Heung Gong
would be not much more than Macao with a better harbour.
Probe still further and you will also find a Chinese nationalist of sorts:
someone who is proud of being Chinese and is rediscovering China, possibly
though the learning of Mandarin, but who is still distrustful and fearful of
the communists. What he wants most is to live in a Heung Gong which retains
the rule of (British) law, and all the attendant freedoms which go with
protection under the law, but who is afraid that come 1997 the 'old China'
habits of nepotism and corruption will re-assert themselves as they are
doing so daily on the mainland.
Critics of Mr Patten contend that his proposals for a fairer method of
electing politicians to LegCo have divided Heung Gong. More accurately, what
Mr Patten's proposals, and the subsequent public debate about them, have
done is simply to make plain the divisions in society that have always been
there but which were wished away by his predecessors and continue to be by
his opponents.
Democracy, for many in Heung Gong, is not Westminster or Capitol Hill writ
small in Central, but a buffer between the colony and the mainland. It is
for this reason that Mr Patten's recent comment that one of the issues in
the current Sino-British talks is the 'through-train' - that China will
accept the electoral judgement of Heung Gong in the colony's 1995 elections
and allow those who win election to sit in the post-June 1997 legislature -
found such widespread support among the people, especially the educated.
Heung Gong may be divided, and it may even like Mr Patten less now than it
did in the heady days after his October 7 policy speech, but it has
responded positively to the colony's more aggressive style of politics and
the way in which LegCo challenges the government.
The greater responsiveness of the government to public opinion and the
assertiveness of LegCo has troubled Heung Gong's powerful business lobby.
Under an earlier pre-Patten version of colonialism it held, from the
perspective of today, a disproportionate sway in government policy-making.
The businesee elite's response to Mr Patten - and one which had found little
favour on the streets of Heung Gong - has been to seek to recreate anew with
China's communist leaders its past colonial relationship with the British.
Business has responded to China's blandishments. Beijing promises the
business elite maintenance of its status, power and wealth. On China's past
and present behaviour business leaders post-1997 might be given a token
status but it is highly unlikely that they will wield any power and, as for
their wealth, they will probably have to share more of it with their future
ruler.
Yet conflicting and contradictory as Hong Kong, Heung Gong and Xiang Gang
may be, there is a point at which the British, local and mainland
perceptions intersect. This is in the commonly shared view of Hong Kong's
role in China's modernisation. At bottom, all views accept that if Hong Kong
has a future it is as the financial and services capital of southern China,
at least.
And all in their own way are working for that end. Britain, by ensuring that
Hong Kong has a legal and regulatory system that bolsters international
confidence in the colony's financial markets; Heung Gong, by investing pell
mell in the mainland; and China, by choosing Xiang Gang as the primary
location for China Inc's tapping of foreign capital.
Although 1997 still has the power to mesmerize and frighten, thanks to these
endeavours the reality on the ground is that, sovereignty and local politics
notwithstanding, the transfer has been largely completed.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Flanders (2): Europe on a Flemish stage - Antwerp,
a city which mixes brio with introversion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANTWERP 93, the arts festival nearly a year long which began at the end of
last month, marks the ancient port's turn as the European city of culture.
It is 'very much a European programme performed on a Flemish stage,' in the
words of Mr Bob Cools, the city's ebullient socialist mayor.
But 1993 could be an even more defining year for Antwerp. It is attempting
to rediscover its roots as an open city, at a time when it is under great
pressure to turn inwards, and become a narrow and xenophobic capital of
intolerant Flemish nationalism.
The two golden ages of Antwerp were the 16th and 17th century - after Bruges
silted up and Antwerp replaced it as the trading hub and great port of the
north - and the 19th century, when it began to establish itself as the
diamond centre of the world it is now.
The port and the diamond trade remain pivots of Antwerp's local economy.
Together they employ 100,000 people, with the port contributing 3.2 per cent
of Belgian GNP, and diamonds accounting for 7 per cent of Belgium's exports.
But they helped underwrite the extraordinary artistic flowerings of the
golden ages, best marked by the early 17th century trio of master painters,
Rubens, Van Dyck and Jacob Jordaens; and by the art nouveau architectural
jewels that stud the city in fin de siecle flights of fancy.
In the view of Mr Eric Antonis, the theatre director in charge of the
Antwerp 93 programme, the best periods of the city's past were 'when it was
an open, cosmopolitan entrepot; the worst were when we were a closed city.'
He, as well as Mr Cools, acknowledges that the city has always been an
uncomfortable mix of metropolitan brio and provincial introversion.
Himself a native of Turnhout near the Dutch border, who has made most of his
theatre career in Amsterdam, Mr Antonis has brought to his job a faith in
Antwerp's best traditions. 'I have never seen a people so in love with their
city,' he says.
But the most stressed recent fact about Antwerp is an ugly one. In the 1991
elections, one out of every four of its inhabitants voted for the Vlaams
Blok - a party of extreme-right Flemish nationalists who want to turn the
city into a Flemish-only enclave. Under the chilling slogan Eigen Volk Eerst
 -'Our People First' - and flying in the face of a history of wealth
generated by Italian, English, German, Jewish and Dutch merchants, the Blok
wants to deport the city's Moroccan and Turkish immigrants, who together
amount to a mere 20th of Antwerp's population of 465,000.
Optimists see the vote as a protest against the parochial squabbles of the
traditional parties, divided across Belgium into Dutch and French-speaking
clans of Christian Democrats, Socialists and Liberals, rather than the
emergence of Antwerp as a fascist citadel.
Mayor Cools says: 'I think that the people in this city who voted for the
Blok must feel a little ashamed. I hope people are opening their eyes to
what the Blok is, and how damaging it is to give Antwerp the reputation of
an extreme right-wing city. After all, we are a port, a city which is
supposed to be open to the rest of the world.'
The Antwerper, Mr Cools insists, is not like that. 'He knows that when he
puts his hand in the water, he is in contact with the entire world.'
Yet the tension spilled over minutes after Antwerp 93's opening last month -
and in a televised clash between Mr Antonis and Mr Cools; men essentially on
the same side of the argument.
Mr Antonis had brought in a Frenchman to stage Antwerp 93's opening
fireworks display, overlooking the rival claim of a local pyrotechnician.
The Frenchman opted for a difficult spectacle to emphasise the role of the
River Scheldt in the city's life, with the fireworks hanging low over the
water. Only a fraction of the 400,000 people who turned up could actually
see it.
The mayor attacked the director for not employing the local man. Mr Antonis
shot back angrily: 'That sounds a bit like Eigen Volk Eerst.'
Mr Antonis says he regrets the outburst. But he insists that there is a
contradiction to be answered between the spirit of a truly international
arts festival and the anti-foreigner animus stirred up by the Vlaams Blok.
'My answer is our history,' he says, adding that 'art is a bit like
society's research department.'
Among the exhibitions pleasing him most is a history of Antwerp as an open
metropolis in the 16th and 17th century, 'with pieces of art telling the
story.' Second, probably, comes the floating theatre constructed on the
Scheldt. Companies from 14 cities will each work in residence for a week,
showing theatre, dance and video, 'telling us what is going on in St.
Petersburg and Johannesbourg, Los Angeles and Ljubljana, Marseilles and
Stockholm.'
The big Jordaens exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts, marking the 400th
anniversary of the local master's birth - is the first real overview of his
work.
Again, Mr Antonis sees the exhibition as evidence of the strength of
openness working out of strong local roots. He is hoping that it will dispel
the 'slightly provincial image' Jordaens has, partly because of Rubens and
Van Dyck's more universal renown.
The year's programme for Antwerp 93 is studded with attractions, from newly
commissioned contemporary operas to steel bands. A permanent fashion centre
will show off a brilliant new generation of Antwerp designers.
In June, the Diamond High Council is putting on an exhibition of unique
jewellery, much of it unseen, from private collections, including Romanov
showpieces let out of the Kremlin for the first time.
All this in a city with a rich variety of good food and drink in some 2,500
restaurants and bars: the expected 3m visitors can sup and quaff in settings
ranging from the renaissance Grote Markt to the art nouveau Cogels-Osylei,
from Chinatown to the riverside.
Rather like Barcelona, with the Olympic Games, Antwerp is - on a more modest
scale - using the festival to refurbish; restoring the city's turn-of-the
century train station, the magnificent 19th century Bourla theatre, and the
cathedral.
The streets are clean, the facades and the trams are bright and gleaming,
and Mr Cools has deftly pedestrianised about a fifth of the inner city. 'I
fought for years for that,' he says, 'but thanks to 1993 I had the
possibility to push it through at last.'
Also like Barcelona, which used the Olympics to rediscover its waterfront,
the Stad aan de Stroom (City on the River) scheme - two building
developments intended to re-attach the river to the city it gave life to -
has been revived by Antwerp 93, partly supervised by a Barcelona architect.
But the most lingering effect sought by Mr Antonis is to make Antwerpers
'proud of their tradition as an open city,' which 'maybe - I say maybe -
could lead to a return of more political openness.' The Blok called a press
conference just after Antwerp 93 opened, to denounce it as propaganda
directed against the party. Aside from the fireworks - damp squibs - Antwerp
93 may be succeeding.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Flanders (1): Sensitive barometer - Belgium's
prosperous and populous Flemish region is seeking new ways to exploit its
trading advantages within the EC without aggravating separatist tensions or
far-right extremists. As Antwerp takes its turn as the cultural capital of
Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IF PEOPLE beyond Belgium's borders know anything about Flanders, it is
probably that it was once a bloody first world war battlefield.
Nowadays, however, most Flemish people want the northern half of Belgium to
be synonymous with economic and industrial progress, culture, and free
trade, washed down with a large draught of political autonomy. 'The golden
passport to Europe' is the slogan chosen by the Flemish external relations
administration to promote the region.
This should be a good year for the public and domestic image of Flanders.
Antwerp took over from Madrid at the end of March as Europe's cultural
capital. Flanders Technology International - an international science fair,
showcase for the region's high-tech industries - celebrates its 10th
birthday in Ghent this week.
Meanwhile, the national parliament is passing a series of measures which
will devolve even more power to Belgium's regions - Flanders, Wallonia and
Brussels. And the Flemish regional government has launched
'Vlaanderen-Europa 2002', an ambitious effort to lay out a strategy for
Flanders over the next decade, placing the region at the heart of a
tripartite decision-making structure: local authorities, regions and the
European Community.
But even in 1993 Flanders is a battlefield for opposing forces. On the one
side, the reasoned discourse of the majority, talking moderation and
federalism, Belgian-style; on the other, the more strident tones of minority
separatists and nationalists. The challenge for the Flemish moderates is to
neutralise their more extreme opponents without inflaming the debate still
further by raising their own voices.
If mainstream Flemish politicians and businesspeople are to be believed,
Flanders is on the brink of a new era of prosperity, built on the same basis
as the Flemish booms of the middle ages and the 16th and 17th centuries:
location and trade.
The geographical bad luck which brought German and allied armies together in
northern Belgium during the Great War, is now a boon. More than half the
population of the EC lives within 500 miles of Antwerp, Flanders' first city
and principal port. Flanders is less than half the (limited) territory of
Belgium, and well over half the population - but its borders are open and
transport infrastructure is good.
Flanders' roads, waterways and railways help export 75 per cent of what the
region's companies make. In some sectors, such as basic metals and textiles,
nearer 80 per cent of what is produced is sold beyond Belgium's borders. Per
capita, Belgium is the largest car exporter in the world: Flanders is a
production base for Ford, Volkswagen and Volvo; Ghent and Antwerp provide
distribution centres for Honda and Mazda respectively.
But because it is responsible for 70 per cent of all Belgian exports,
Flanders is a very sensitive barometer of the state of the European economy
and world trade, and the region's great ports are its needle. As Mr Jan
Devroe, president of the Antwerp Port Authority, puts it: 'Everything which
affects the free market and limits it, affects us.'
For the time being, recession is taking the shine off the golden passport.
Unemployment in Flanders is running at a lower rate than in the poorer
region of Wallonia, but it is growing faster, as the foreign companies which
are among Flanders' largest employers begin to cut back. Public investment
is at a historic low across Belgium.
To the frustration of even moderate Flemish politicians and economists, the
far-reaching reforms of the Belgian constitution which will formally change
the country into a federal state, will give little new fiscal and financial
autonomy to the regional government.
Instead, the reforms are whetting Flemings' appetite for even more
independence, part of a continuous and sometimes painful process of
emancipation which began almost as soon as Belgium was declared independent
in 1830.
This tendency is easily exaggerated. For example, Flemish politicians from
the main political parties cast doubt on the simplistic perception that the
constitutional changes will inevitably precipitate an acrimonious break-up
of Belgium, creating a west European parallel for the Czech-Slovak split.
'There is a basic conviction that the largest powers will go to the north
and the south, but there's also a major part of the Flemish population which
says we should maintain the kingdom,' explains Mr Luc Van den Brande,
minister-president of the Flemish government - a coalition of socialists and
Christian Democrats like the national administration.
If Belgium is to achieve this peaceful goal, however, there will have to be
a great deal more co-operation between the regions than has been evident to
date. Diplomatic relations within Belgium often seem to be trickier than
between regions and third countries.
In recent months, for example, Mr Van den Brande has managed to arrange
talks with the prime minister of the Netherlands in The Hague, but he and
his Walloon and Bruxellois counterparts have struggled to organise a meeting
in their own country.
If internal relations do break down, then it is clear that Flemings and
Walloons will be only too ready to blame one another for the disintegration
of the state. Mr Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the opposition Flemish liberal
democrats - now Flanders' most popular party - warns that financial
imbalances between the two regional economies could be the catalyst for a
split: 'If there is not a will to start up a new dialogue between the
regions and communities about the financial problems in this country I think
you will see a growth of separatism in this country in the next few years.'
That would play into the hands of extremists on both sides of the Belgian
linguistic divide, but particularly in Flanders, where the far-right Vlaams
Blok party gained a shocking 10.4 per cent of the regional vote at the last
national elections in 1991.
The vote was partly an expression of discontent with the political
establishment, but it also reflected many ordinary Flemings' suspicion of
the openness which has characterised Belgium and Flanders since the second
world war, a suspicion now being fuelled by recession.
That is part of the reason why the Flemish government has pinned its hopes
on an outward-looking strategy which 'appeals to the Flemish population to
work towards a new Flanders in Europe.'
Interestingly, Vlaams Blok also talks about the region's future in European
terms. But when Mr Karel Dillen, a Blok Euro-MP, says he wants to 'make
Flanders European' - as he did at last month's session of the European
Parliament - he means he wants to expel non-EC immigrants, many of whom,
ironically, were brought in as cheap labour by Flemish companies during the
booming 1960s.
Mr Van den Brande rejects such calls-to-arms. 'We're trying to mobilise our
population, instead of regressing and building a new wall around Flanders.
It's essential that we're open to other cultures,' he says.
But what is already clear is that Flemings will never be comfortable with a
strong international economic identity, if it is won at the expense of
Flanders' vibrant historical and cultural heritage.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Major's EC policy puzzle: Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After so many demoralising months of hard pounding over the notorious
Maastricht Treaty, the British government has decided it is now safe to come
up from the bunker and re-nail its tattered flag to the European mast.
The ratification war is not yet won. But the end is near enough for the
prime minister to believe he can and should re-affirm his support for the
treaty. So he has started delivering some pro-European speeches, despite the
undiluted hostility of a minority of his party, led by Lady Thatcher.
So far it is not easy to detect the policy prescriptions in Mr Major's
pro-European message. He is in favour of Britain's continued membership of
the Community, because being outside would be worse; he believes Britain
should be at the heart of Europe, whatever that may mean; but he does not
have any positive agenda for where the EC should go next or what it should
do.
Mr Major is happy to express hostility to any form of centralism in
Brussels. But for the rest, what we are getting is a message which is
pro-European in tone, but without any discernible policy content.
We should not be surprised. There was a time, in the distant past, when some
people in the original six member states believed that Britain would
eventually outgrow its innate scepticism, and come to understand, or even
share, their commitment to the Community model of European integration. The
reality of two decades of British membership has disabused them of this
touching faith.
The plain fact is that the British political establishment does not like the
treaty, and does not care much for the Community either. And the depth of
its aversion has emerged clearly in the Maastricht ratification debates.
Ostensibly there is a large majority in Westminster in favour of the treaty.
But the debate over the social chapter has exposed a deeper reality, because
it has generated conditions in which quite different alliances can conduct a
covert fight against the Community behind the cloak of opposing party
ideologies.
Objective reasons for Britain's Euro-scepticism are elusive. The UK economy
is not radically different from other Community members. Whatever Mrs
Thatcher's wishes, Britain is not like America: its social structures are
similar to those of all other European countries, with highly developed
networks of public welfare, health, education and social protection.
Whatever its irrational reasons, it is manifest that the British political
establishment is uncomfortable with the European ambitions of its opposite
numbers on the Continent. Until last September, Mr Major pretended to have a
European policy, in the formula: Pounds 1 = DM 2.95. Events showed this was
just a slogan, built on a fantasy.
Arguably, Mr Major needs a more solid European policy, and needs it
urgently. Ratification of Maastricht is not the end of the story. Unless the
exchange rate mechanism collapses completely, the other states will press
forward. What will Mr Major say then?
The negotiations to admit new members from EFTA cannot fail to re-open
debate on the full gamut of Maastricht commitments. What will Mr Major say
then?
At the very least, enlargement must include more majority voting, and most
likely a strengthening of the European Parliament. What will Mr Major say
then? If he is not to be wrong-footed on such politically loaded policies,
he needs to look for some issue where he can take a slightly more
constructive stance.
The obvious choice should be the foreign and security policy chapter in the
treaty, because Britain has real assets: its diplomatic service, its
professional army, its seat on the Security Council, its nuclear weapons.
But the British establishment's conditioned reflexes jerk it three ways: the
claims of European co-operation have tended to give way to great-power
nostalgia or to vice-regal submission to the US.
Bosnia has been a case in point. While the US stayed home, Britain and
France worked hand-in-hand. When President Clinton threatened to get
involved, Britain cranked round to get in line, regardless of the merits of
the new US policy. This US whip-saw cannot be good, either for Europe or for
Nato.
Now there is a school of thought in Whitehall that Britain is under no
urgent pressure to respond to the Community agenda. First, the programme for
Economic and Monetary Union is in disarray. Second, some other member states
are themselves in political difficulty; for example, Italy, Belgium, Spain.
Third, there are major uncertainties over the costs of our social welfare
systems.
It would be difficult to deny the reality or the gravity of these problems.
There is clearly a multi-faceted crisis of the European nation state; one
facet is political corruption, as in France, Spain and, above all, Italy;
another is the failure of the left-right political model, as in France; a
third is the tension between the illusion of national sovereignty and the
pain of regional solidarity.
There is also the crisis of European competitivity, which shows up in the
arguments over EMU, over the costs of the welfare state and the social
chapter, and contradictory pressures between protectionism and trade
liberalisation in the Uruguay Round negotiations. And then there is the
crisis of strategic disorder - witness the disintegration of Russia and
Yugoslavia.
But anyone who argues that these crises exonerate Britain from coming to
terms with the Community paradigm, and from finding a constructive European
policy, is making a mistake. Unfortunately, it is the same mistake Britain
has been making for 50 years.

FT  04 MAY 93 / A field-day for the bears: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSEI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another wave of pessimism about the US economy now seems unavoidable. Even
bearish forecasters were surprised by first quarter growth figures which
showed the economy expanding at a sluggish annual rate of 1.8 per cent,
sharply down from the 4.7 per cent rate of the fourth quarter. Final sales
actually fell and, but for a jump in corporate inventories (stocks of unsold
goods), real gross domestic product would also have contracted. Yesterday
brought more gloom: the Purchasing Managers' Index - a widely followed guide
to the health of manufacturing industry - was reported sharply down in
April, mainly because of a plunge in orders.
'Poor lemmings are still crowding into the US stock market even though it is
more overvalued than it has ever been,' says Mr Jim Davidson in a tone of
resigned disbelief. Mr Davidson, an investment adviser based in Alexandria,
Virginia, is predicting a crash in US share prices, a decline in GDP in
spite of further easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve and a rise
in the US budget deficit to Dollars 600bn-Dollars 700bn as the economy sags.
With co-author Lord Rees-Mogg (the former editor of the London Times), he
has just published a new edition of The Great Reckoning (Simon &amp; Schuster),
a survival guide for the 'final depression of the 20th century'.
I mention Mr Davidson's forecast, not because I agree with it, but to
illustrate the diversity of informed opinion on the US economy. While not
implying another recession, the GDP figures are ominous in some respects.
The weakness of some of the US's largest trading partners does appear,
finally, to be sapping the vitality of the recovery.
Last year US exports defied recessionary forces, growing at a real rate of
about 6 per cent. In the first quarter they contracted at an annual rate of
7 per cent relative to the fourth quarter. These preliminary figures, which
are often heavily revised, may well be overstating US export weakness; on
the other hand, few analysts believe the US has yet felt the full impact of
the slow-down in Japan and continental Europe. But whatever the fate of
exports, pessimists should remember that they account for less than 15 per
cent of national income; the US is thus far better placed than small, open
European economies to withstand even severe shocks to its external trade.
Other sources of first quarter weakness are less troubling. Business
equipment investment expanded less rapidly than at the end of last year, but
it still managed a creditable annual rate of increase of nearly 9 per cent
relative the fourth quarter - hardly a recessionary reading. Residential
investment stalled completely, but home building was hit by bad weather and
had anyway soared late last year.
Government purchases contracted sharply too, but this reflected a
precipitous decline in defence spending at an annual rate of 25 per cent
relative to the fourth quarter. Defence will remain weak, but not this weak:
almost certainly the collapse reflected the Bush administration's frantic
efforts to pump up the economy ahead of November's presidential election by
bringing forward spending.
This brings us to consumer spending, easily the most important component of
demand. Real consumption grew at an annual rate of just over 1 per cent
against more than 5 per cent in the fourth quarter. The slow-down was
inevitable, given the low rate of US saving and the fact that consumer
spending raced ahead of personal incomes at the end of last year.
But with employment so far growing faster than last year, and with debt
burdens and interest rates well down, real consumer spending should grow
faster this year than the 2.3 per cent registered for the whole of 1992.
While consumption growth at an annualised rate of 5 per cent was never
realistic, an underlying rate of, say, 3 per cent is not far-fetched.
Recoveries never proceed in a straight line: a couple of strong quarters
followed by a weak quarter is a perfectly normal pattern. But the eight
successive quarters of growth registered since the mild contraction in the
winter of 1990-91 are a reassuring sign of the economy's underlying
momentum.
If you average the fourth and first quarters, you get real growth at an
annual rate of 3.3 per cent, in keeping with the rate of expansion in the
third quarter of last year and close to what most economists still believe
is feasible for this year as a whole. A glance at spending in cash rather
than inflation-adjusted terms confirms the economy's continuing buoyancy:
nominal GDP grew at an annual rate of about 5 per cent in the first quarter,
down from 7 per cent in the fourth quarter, but hardly a signal of impending
doom.
Early figures for April provide tentative signs of a pick-up in spending.
But the decline in the Purchasing Managers' Index suggests production and
employment could be subdued for several months in reaction to weak demand in
the first quarter. Consumer and business confidence is fragile partly
because of growing uncertainty about the Clinton economic programme. Nobody
is any longer sure which taxes will go up or whether the promised deficit
reduction will materialise. At this stage the best guess remains that US
growth will erratically climb back towards 3 per cent later this year.

FT  04 MAY 93 / FT Interview: The art of a political warrior - Ichiro Ozawa,
Japan's leading political reformer, speaks to Robert Thomson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ichiro Ozawa carries into a room a tangible sense of certainty about his
destiny. The chosen son of past elders of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic
party, he now runs a breakaway faction and portrays himself as anointed by
history to change the unchangeable: Japanese politics.
Cultivated carefully by the US government, which also sees him as the man
most likely to lead Japan into the next century, Mr Ozawa, 51, is hampered
by scandal. He is awaiting his moment to return triumphantly to a debate
about 'political reform' which is animating the country.
Mr Ozawa was to have travelled to London this week to become more fully
acquainted with British-style democracy. Difficulty in arranging meetings
with perceived equals, including Mr John Major, the prime minister, and
rumours of a snap election in Japan prompted him to cancel the visit,
however.
For most Japanese, the recent conversion of Ozawa the Manipulator, who
controlled the LDP from a backroom, into Ozawa the Reformer, pushing for
openness and renovation, is one of the small miracles of the recent
political instability.
Apart from Mr Ozawa's recently created LDP faction, a new party has
surfaced. It is called, quite aptly, the Japan New party. There also exists
a thriving crop of reform groups and a Tokyo-style 'electronic town hall',
as patented by Ross Perot in the US. Parliament is trying to redraw
electoral boundaries and is debating tougher controls on political funding,
while rumours emerge daily of fresh scandals and unholy alliances.
Among the most tantalising of the reports is that Mr Ozawa and Mr Tsutomu
Hata, the former finance minister, are planning a new, mainstream party,
slightly left-of-centre, a party which would draw members from the Japan
Socialist party and from other opposition parties. The aim is to provide an
electable alternative to the LDP, which has held power for the past four
decades and which, according to reformers, has outlived its usefulness.
'Everybody is asking about the idea of a new party, but we can't see clearly
yet what will happen. The first thing we must do is change the system of
constituencies,' he said.
As a card-carrying LDP member, his talk of a new party must necessarily be
guarded, but the implication is that the time is coming when a new party
will emerge, one in which he might well have played a formative role.
One obstacle to launching a new party is the recession, which has slowed the
flow of corporate donations into politics, as has the recent round of
corruption scandals. Mr Ozawa's alleged but denied links to those scandals -
involving illegal payments by the construction industry to politicians in
the hope of buying influence and winning contracts - have made it difficult
for him to collect funds. It remains true that an overhaul of the electoral
system would make politics a cheaper business, less prone to corruption and
more open to new parties.
Reform has been deftly derailed in the past. The Recruit stocks-for-favours
scandal of four years ago was widely supposed to have provoked fundamental
change. At that time, there were suggestions that Ms Takako Doi, the Iron
Butterfly, could lead the socialists to power. Instead, the strongly
ideological party retreated into a self-defeating theoretical debate about
its policies and Japanese voters appeared to forgive the LDP its excesses.
This time, Mr Ozawa says, will be different: 'There is such strong feeling
now because change has been building up in the system. Each of the scandals,
Lockheed, Recruit, and so on, have added a momentum to the debate. I believe
reform has a good chance of success.'
Portents of change were broadcast on Japanese television last month,
according to Mr Ozawa, referring to images of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime
minister, in the company of US President Clinton in Washington. Mr Ozawa
argues Japan should no longer be represented by Miyazawa-like politicians.
'As I was watching these two leaders, standing side by side, my deepest
fears were realised. Everything about them - their expressions, their
stature - told you that these two men were from different eras. Mr Miyazawa
is the personification of the cold war era. It is not a matter of age; it is
a way of thinking.'
Part of Mr Ozawa's platform, and one reason for US belief that he represents
a new era in Japanese politics, is his argument that Tokyo cannot play a
full role in international affairs without domestic political reforms that
would make the government quicker to respond to outside challenges.
Mr Ozawa supports constitutional changes which would allow the military
greater freedom in international peacekeeping operations and which would
develop a foreign policy more independent of the US.
'For the first time in half a century, we can see that the Clinton
administration has a different attitude to relations with Japan. We can
debate whether there is a consciousness change among the people of Japan,
but there does need to be, at the least, a change in the consciousness of
the people's leaders.'
The unusual public criticism of Mr Miyazawa partly reflects Mr Ozawa's anger
at his faction's isolation from the five other LDP factions. Meanwhile, the
prime minister has not forgiven Mr Ozawa's alleged 'arrogance' two years
ago, when Mr Miyazawa was forced to make a humiliating visit to the office
of Mr Ozawa, then party power broker, to have his appointment confirmed.
Other LDP faction heads also thought Mr Ozawa was rising too quickly from
behind Mr Shin Kanemaru, the 'godfather' of Japanese politics, now awaiting
trial on tax evasion charges. These LDP officials were delighted that Mr
Ozawa was hauled before parliament to testify on his links to Mr Kanemaru,
among the politicians who received kickbacks from construction companies.
With the Kanemaru crisis itself an inspiration for reform and Mr Ozawa very
close to the 'godfather', the Japanese public has yet to be convinced that
he is clean. And, like Mr Miyazawa, many Japanese perceive that Mr Ozawa, an
MP since the age of 27, is a little too confident of his political prowess.
Personality reform, however, forms no part of the Ozawa agenda.
'In terms of actions and awareness, I am not typically Japanese. It is very
comfortable to be an ordinary Japanese, but I can't allow myself to become
complacent. It is my duty to keep sounding the bell and to make people more
aware. I know some people describe me as arrogant, but I have no intention
of changing to suit them.'
Mr Ozawa makes an important distinction between 'tactics' and 'strategy'.
For tactics, the day-to-day manoeuvring against political opponents, he
finds The Art of War, the Chinese classic military manual by Sun Tzu, a
useful text. The Art of War advises generals not to camp on low-lying ground
and states that the ultimate satisfaction in a battle is to win without
shots being fired.
For strategy, the longer-term political outlook, he finds inspiration in
another Chinese text called Shiji, which traces the rise and fall of
dynasties. His interest in history is reflected in his own comparison of
1990s Japan with 1860s Japan, the time of the Meiji Restoration, when
reformers were struggling against state-controlled feudalism.
Mr Ozawa is drawing on these lessons of history to make sense of a political
battleground on which only the initial skirmishes have begun. Like most
Japanese, he is uncertain about the future course of a sometimes opaque
debate about control - a debate made more complex by shifting relationships
 -but he is confident that he will recognise the moment for action and will
triumph in the end.
'In Japanese history, during the Meiji Restoration period, there were many
foot soldiers of reform who withered away without leaving any footprints,
any sign of their contribution. I don't mind sacrificing myself for reform,
as long as that sacrifice is not in vain.'

THE main focus for the foreign exchange market this week will be the US
non-farm payroll figure for April due out on Friday, writes James Blitz.
Traditionally, the payroll figure is the most important US indicator
affecting the dollar, and this week it takes on particular significance.
Recent US data have shown that the strong upturn in the US economy seen in
the fourth quarter of last year did not follow through to the first quarter
of 1993.
Last Friday's data under-lined that the US economic upturn is proving to be
sluggish. US personal consumption, for example, showed a decline of 0.2 per
cent in March against expect-ations of a 0.1 per cent dip.
After the net fall of 22,000 in the headline payroll figure in the March
month, analysts appear to be looking for a rise of 175,000 in the April
number.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, how-ever, chief currency strategist at Citibank in
London, believes the figure will only show an increase of around 70,000.
He thinks that the drop in personal consumption and the difficulty that
President Bill Clinton has had getting his budget stimulus package through
congress require a downward revision in growth forecasts for this year.
The poor news on the economy is particularly disappointing for dollar
investors because it comes amid new indications that the Bundesbank wants to
cut interest rates further, narrowing the differential between short-term
German and US rates.
There is little expectation of another reduction in official German interest
rates at this week's Bundesbank council meeting. However, last Friday's cut
in Germany's three-day Treasury Bill rate has raised new speculation that
the discount rate floor will be lowered later this month.

FT  04 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Falling bond yields spur late
buying surge
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
A BURST of late buying lifted US share prices across the board yesterday.
Earlier, the markets had struggled to make headway after news of a decline
in manufacturing activity raised fresh doubts over the strength of the
economic recovery, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 18.91 at 3,446.46. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 2.27 at 442.46, while the American SE composite
finished 1.25 firmer at 422.21 and the Nasdaq composite 5.29 stronger at
666.71. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 225m shares.
The markets opened the week in a cautious mood. The first-quarter reporting
season proved that corporate profitability is improving, but a slew of
recent evidence suggesting that economic growth is slowing down has clouded
the outlook for future earnings.
Yesterday's economic data was especially disturbing. The National
Association of Purchasing Management reported that its index of business
activity fell to 49.7 per cent in April, from the 53.4 per cent of the
previous month. A measure below 50 per cent is indicative of a contracting
manufacturing sector, and it is the first time the index has been below 50
per cent since September 1992.
Coupled with news of a small decline in March construction spending, the
NAPM added to investors' concern about the state of the economy. A rise in
bond prices triggered by the NAPM, however, helped stocks to stay in
positive territory for most of the day, and a subsequent fall in bond yields
spurred a surge of buying in the final hours of trading.
Among individual stocks, Eastman Kodak, which has suffered recently because
of the turmoil among the company's top management, rose Dollars  7/8 to
Dollars 49 5/8 in busy trading after Kodak's independent board of directors
called for a significant improvement in the company's performance, a call
that was seen as backing for Kodak's chairman, Mr Kay Whitmore.
Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing rose Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 113 1/2 after
the company unveiled first-quarter net income of Dollars 1.51 a share, up
from Dollars 1.38 a share a year earlier.
Among the main beneficiaries of the late buying were motor and drug shares.
General Motors climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 42 1/4 , Ford added Dollars
1 1/8 at Dollars 55 7/8 and Chrysler firmed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 42 1/8 .
In the drugs sector, Merck advanced Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 38 1/4 , Pfizer
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 69 3/4 and Johnson &amp; Johnson Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 44 7/8 .
Bethlehem Steel put on Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 19 7/8 in busy trading after
the company said it would increase its steel and alloy plate products prices
on July 4 to recover manufacturing costs.
On the Nasdaq market, Chiron jumped Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 58 on news that
in recent tests a herpes vaccine produced by the company in a joint venture
with Ciba-Geigy was shown to significantly reduce the frequency of
outbreaks.
Canada
TORONTO closed lower in heavy trading as gold stocks gave back a big chunk
of last week's gains.
The TSE 300 index fell 15.9 to 3,773.5 and declining issues outnumbered
advances by 371 to 327 after volume of 55.7m shares valued at CDollars
550.3m.
Nine of the 14 stock groups lost ground, led by the golds sector, off 3.5
per cent.

FT  04 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Manila at a record high
as Australia retreats
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH Tokyo remaining closed until Thursday for the Golden Week holiday,
markets in the region moved in various directions yesterday on domestic
issues. Bangkok was also shut for a holiday.
MANILA climbed to a new high in quiet trading, breaking last week's record
as demand for equities outpaced supply. Some analysts noted that the market
continues to benefit from the increasing liquidity brought about by the
reduction of banks' reserve requirement last Friday to 23 per cent from 24
per cent.
The composite index closed 11.13 up at 1,615.46. It has risen 28 per cent
since the start of the year. Gains led declines by 34 to 13, while 25 issues
were unchanged. Volume fell to 584m shares valued at 218m pesos from
Friday's 2.1bn shares worth 1.6bn pesos.
AUSTRALIA ended at its lowest level since April 7 as profit-taking took
hold. The All Ordinaries index shed 17.0 to 1,664.5 in volume of 246m shares
worth ADollars 252.3m. The All Industrials index fell 23.6 to 2,592.0 and
All Resources weakened 12.0 to 955.9.
Gold shares receded from recent highs and the sector's index dropped 23.9 to
1,432.1. Newcrest eased a cent to ADollars 3.14, Poseidon Gold fell 13 cents
to ADollars 2.67 and Placer Pacific lost 4 cents to ADollars 1.84.
Banking issues held up well on hopes of a further reduction in interest
rates. National Australia firmed a cent to ADollars 9.03, Westpac eased a
cent to ADollars 3.32, ANZ dipped 3 cents to ADollars 3.40 and Commonwealth
Bank shed 4 cents to ADollars 8.14.
Elsewhere, BHP slipped 18 cents to ADollars 14.26 and Brambles was down 22
cents at ADollars 14.50.
HONG KONG finished easier, but well off the day's lows, helped by late
bargain hunting. The Hang Seng index lost 40.40 at 6,790.11, having
initially touched 6,727.64. Turnover shrank to HKDollars 3.15bn from
Friday's HKDollars 4.56bn.
Blue chips, which bore the brunt of early profit-taking, recovered lost
ground, with Cheung Kong unchanged at HKDollars 26.10 after bouncing from a
low of HKDollars 25.60. Actively traded HSBC was down HKDollars 1 at
HKDollars 70.50, but after HKDollars 70.
Profit-taking was also outweighed by switching to market laggards,
particularly second and third liners, including Seabase International, up 30
cents at HKDollars 4.125, and Conic Investment, 62 cents stronger at
HKDollars 4.175.
BOMBAY fell back, sentiment affected by disappointing full year results from
Reliance Industries. The BSE index slipped 19 to 2,081.
Although Reliance reported 1992 profits of Rp3.2bn (Dollars 103m) against
Rp1.6bn last year, the market had been expecting a figure in excess of
Rp3.5bn. The shares finished Rp5 cheaper at Rp177.50.
KARACHI gained ground as investors brushed aside news of political
uncertainty and gave fresh buying orders. The KSE index put on 3.86 at
1,098.45 and rises led falls by 155 to 126. Volume improved to 2.1m shares
from 1.9m.
JAKARTA closed slightly softer in moderate trade. The official index eased
0.32 to 313.69. Trafindo lost Rp300 to Rp2,800 after a number of brokers
downgraded the stock.
TAIWAN saw some late buying that pulled the market up from early lows but
turnover contracted to its lowest level since February. The weighted index
was off 27.20 at 4,473.80, after earlier dropping more than 40 points.
Turnover declined to TDollars 21.28bn from Saturday's TDollars 23.2bn.
The mood was soured by falls on Saturday and news that villagers protesting
against pollution were blockading the Tashe Petrochemical Industrial Zone in
southern Taiwan.
SEOUL ended a lethargic session a shade firmer in what brokers described as
a technical improvement centred on blue chip manufacturing shares. The
market index added 0.91 at 718.59.
Late institutional bargain hunting helped the market higher, although many
remain cautious after recent steep rises.
SINGAPORE was higher, with last-hour demand for blue chips pushing the
market up. The Straits Times Industrial index ended 7.27 ahead at 1,790.90
in volume that dipped to 247.54m shares.
KUALA LUMPUR declined on profit-taking after an early sharp advance as
investors turned cautious. The composite index ended 2.24 down on balance at
717.37, mainly due to a 60-cent drop in Telekom Malaysia to MDollars 15.60.
The index initially set a new all-time peak of 724.16.
NEW ZEALAND continued to be affected by weakness in Carter Holt Harvey and
Fletcher Challenge, the former losing 5 cents to NZDollars 3.02 and the
latter 7 cents to NZDollars 2.74. The NZSE-40 index fell 17.39 to 1,594.35
in turnover of NZDollars 23m.

THE stock market reacted calmly yesterday following the assassination on
Saturday of President Ranasinghe Premadasa, Reuter reports from Colombo.
Economists and bankers said future foreign investment might be affected, but
changes in economic policy were unlikely.
The Colombo All-Share index fell 6.09 to 535.76. National Development Bank,
one of the most active stocks, finished Rp3.25 down at Rp89.25, but well
above the day's low of Rp85.
Mr Iftikar Ahamed, treasurer at Deutsche Bank, said: 'Foreign investors who
are looking to come in will probably tend to shy away and adopt a more
wait-and-see attitude, but for foreign investment already in the country, I
do not see much going out.'

FT  04 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Euro Disney regains favour
with rise of 3%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE UK and Tokyo closed yesterday, trading in continental Europe
generally lacked direction and volume.
PARIS lost a little momentum in late trading as the CAC-40 index finished
2.06 easier at 1,936.97
Euro Disney was back in favour, improving some 3 per cent to close FFr2.35
up at FFr75.85, helped by last Friday's announcement of the appointment of a
new chief financial officer. There was also speculation that the group might
reveal further restructuring proposals this week.
Michelin suffered another fall after Friday's 6 per cent loss, finishing
FFr1.80 lower at FFr141.70. Peugeot declined FFr5 to FFr550.
CGIP, up FFr20 at FFr1,090, confirmed that it had sold part of its stake in
Cap Gemini Sogeti, down FFr4.50, or 2.3 per cent, at FFr189.00.
MILAN found comfort in the growing view that Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi will be able to stitch back together a broadly based coalition
government, possibly including the ministers who resigned last week. The
Comit index rose 12.32, or 2.3 per cent, to 538.62, but trading volume was
restrained.
This takes prices back to around the levels of last Thursday before the
resignations prompted a sell-off by private domestic investors early on
Friday and institutions stepped in to recoup some of the losses.
Analysts expect the market to remain around current levels until Mr Ciampi's
government announces a programme and puts it to a parliamentary vote on
Thursday.
Mr Fabio Ferrando of Albertini in Milan said: 'Given the current political
and economic situation, the support of the PDS to the government would be a
good thing because broad support will mean a strong government able to take
tough decisions. The next step will be to see whether Mr Ciampi wins
Thursday's vote of confidence. Investors will take their cue from that.'
Stet, the state telecommunications group was a strong performer, rising
L104, or 4.1 per cent, to fix at L2,635, before slipping to L2.630 after
hours.
FRANKFURT managed a slight improvement but most traders said activity
remained unenthusiastic. The steel strikes in east Germany, which began
yesterday, are also affecting investor interest. The DAX index was finally
1.97 ahead at 1,629.16, after a day's low of 1,617.40.
Among the actives, Siemens gained a net DM1.10 at DM617.10, after falling to
DM611.30. Continental was up DM2.20 at DM194.50 ahead of reporting a group
net profit of DM133m, against a DM128m loss in 1992. Elsewhere in the
automotive sector, Volkswagen lost 70 pfg to DM323.00 as BMW and Daimler
made respective gains of DM6 and DM2 to DM470 and DM577.50.
ZURICH was higher in active trade, led by chemical and pharmaceutical
shares, and the SMI index rose 23.1 to 2.152.8.
Ciba-Geigy, SFr14 ahead at SFr604, was the most active stock. The sector is
gaining ground on a growing view that US plans for health reform may be less
damaging to the outlook for Swiss groups than originally thought. Roche
certificates rose SFr80 to SFr4,370.
Bearers in Ems Chemie, a medium-sized chemicals group, rose SFr150, or 7.5
per cent, to SFr2,150 after the company said it planned to buy back up to
250,000 of its own bearer shares for SFr2,200 per share.
Among banks, UBS bearers added SFr7 at SFr941.
Ascom bearers came under renewed pressure, falling SFr70, or 5.6 per cent,
to SFr1,180.
BRUSSELS remained weak in very thin trading. The Bel-20 index fell 8.0 to
1,189.52, registering the market's 12th fall in the last 13 sessions.
Petrofina, which breached a technical support at BFr8,500 on Friday,
recovered most of its intra-day losses just before the market closed, ending
BFr20 easier at BFr8,380, having dipped to a low of BFr8,220.
UCB, the chemicals, pharmaceuticals and packaging group, extended recent
weakness, closing a net BFr350 down at BFr21,525, after an 18-month low of
BFr21,300.
Delhaize, the retailer that was hit on Friday by union action and picketing
at its stores, was one of the few blue chip stocks bucking the lower trend.
It finished BFr6 firmer at BFr1,144.
AMSTERDAM, which was closed on Friday, was able to react to the news that
Philips was to end its partnership with Matsushita in their semiconductor
joint venture. Philips' shares gained Fl 1.00 at Fl 25.60, but after a day's
high of Fl 26.10. The CBS Tendency index ended 0.4 easier at 107.2.
STOCKHOLM was active in banking issues, with S-E Banken up SKr5 in the 'A'
shares to SKr17, on expectations that the sector is set for recovery. The
Affarsvarlden index rose 1.8 to 1,032.2 in turnover of SKr635m. Stora lost
SKr11 to SKr299 ahead of tomorrow's first-quarter results. HELSINKI fell on
profit-taking. The HEX index closed 13.6 down at 1,173.5 in turnover of
FM79.2m.
ISTANBUL made a spirited early effort to maintain the upward momentum but a
broad wave of profit-taking left shares slightly easier.
The market index ended 2.33 lower at 7,805.31, bringing two-session losses
to 91.61 since Thursday's all-time high of 7,896.92, which was the 10th
closing peak recorded during April. The index had surged 271 points, taking
it above the 8,000 level, in the first half-hour before profit-takers
stepped in.
Investors became cautious ahead of the expected formal nomination today of
Mr Suleyman Demirel as president, intensifying speculation about who will
take over as True Path Party chairman and prime minister if parliament
elects him.
The Eurotrack 100 index was unavailable owing to the closure of the London
Stock Exchange.

FT  04 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Gradual recovery from
Europe's currency crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European currency crisis last year helped fan concerns about some
sovereign credits. Three were particularly badly hit: Sweden, Finland and
Italy. Eurobond yield spreads in these sovereign credits ballooned as rating
agencies downgraded their debt, and the fight back has proved a difficult
one.
Swedish borrowers have been the quickest to recover. Last week's Dollars
200m five-year deal for Spintab, the Swedish mortgage bank, launched at 85
basis points over the comparable US Treasury, showed a marked spread
contraction. A five-year Spintab deal launched in April 1992 at 80 basis
points over the curve had widened to 135 basis points by November.
Sweden's continuing presence in the primary market, paying higher spreads
where needed, has proved successful. Its cost of funds has fallen from about
25 basis points over Libor on D-Mark and sterling deals at the end of last
year, to just above Libor on recent French franc and Canadian dollar issues.
Finland, which fared rather worse, followed the same pattern. Finnish Export
Credit's funding costs, which rose as high as 50 basis points over Libor,
are closer to Libor flat now. However, Finnish banks would still find it
difficult to come to the market.
Italy is having the roughest ride. It is still trading largely on an
asset-swap basis. This means that, unlike most high-quality debt, gauged in
terms of its yield spread above the relevant government bond, it is treated
as a high-yielding floating-rate asset, viewed in terms of the margin over
Libor produced by asset-swapping. In these terms, Italy's 10-year Eurobonds
are trading at 50 basis points above Libor.
Last month, Italian Treasury officials hosted presentations in London in the
hopes of addressing some of the concerns of international investors.
Italy is expected to return to the Eurobond market once Moody's has
completed its latest review of the country. In March, Moody's placed Italy's
AA3 rating under review for possible downgrade. If a downgrade goes ahead,
the potential investor base for Italian debt will shrink further, as many
investors cannot buy debt rated below AA.

FT  04 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Asia may offer opportunities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL investors are well-acquainted with the Asian stock markets,
but tend to be far less familiar with the region's bond markets, most of
which are small and undeveloped. However, as investors scour the globe for a
wider range of investments, some are asking whether the Asian bond markets
can provide interesting investment opportunities.
The outlook for fixed income securities markets in the Asian-Pacific rim is
brightening, according to a recent report from the OECD* which looks at the
debt securities markets in the 'Dynamic Asian Economies' (DAEs) of Hong
Kong, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.
The OECD report points out that 'the promotion of these (debt) markets has
become an almost common goal of government policy among the DAEs' for
several reasons.
These include a perceived increase in government borrowing needs (for
example, for large infrastructure projects), the desire to have a broader
range of monetary instruments and the need for a wider variety of means by
which private enterprises can raise money.
The Asian Development Bank has taken some steps towards promoting the Asian
capital markets. In 1991, it launched its so-called Dragon Bond - a bond
issued in the main Asian bond markets. The aim was to widen its investor
base in the region, diversifying its own funding sources away from the
Euromarket, Yankee bond and Japanese markets, and to encourage other bond
issuers to use the Asian capital markets.
Mr Andrew Ferguson, deputy managing director of Wardley in Hong Kong, the
local lead manager for the ADB's Dragon bond issue in 1991, says in the OECD
report that the ADB's issue has alerted other multilateral development
agencies and triple-A issuers to the possibility of tapping the Asian market
now that a useful benchmark issue has been established.
'Regulatory controls that have impeded the development of the capital
markets have been brought into sharper focus, questioned and, in some cases,
relaxed,' Mr Ferguson says.
Even so, problems remain. Mr Robert Pozen, a managing director of Fidelity
Investments in Boston, points out in the OECD report that big US investors
prize the following attributes when considering whether to buy a country's
sovereign debt: political stability; the ability to service debt; a fully
convertible currency; unrestricted capital movement; market liquidity; and
reliable pricing.
One global securities house which has made a preliminary study of the
investment opportunities available in Asia highlights poor secondary market
liquidity as the key obstacle when it comes to investing in the region's
debt markets.
On the demand side, the report notes that many investors prefer to hold debt
until maturity for tax reasons, which does little to encourage secondary
market activity.
The OECD sees the existence of controlled interest rates - particularly in
countries such as Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand - as a severe obstacle in
the creation of more liquid markets.
It points out that the effective yields of the bonds are below free-market
levels 'with the result that the securities are only held by captive
holders, that is, financial institutions which are required to do so to
fulfil reserve and liquidity requirements.'

FT  04 MAY 93 / Risk and Reward: Computer-based approach to stock-picking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARR Rosenberg probably knows as much about the use of computers in taking
investment decisions as anyone. Barr, a consultancy whose risk management
model is used widely by quantitative investment managers, was founded in his
basement in Berkeley, California. It still bears his name, though he left
eight years ago to put his money where his mouth is and set up a fund
management firm. It now has Dollars 4bn under management.
The recessionary 1990s, though, proved there is nothing infallible about
computer-based stock-pickers. They make mistakes just like their human
counterparts. And like humans, they try to learn from those mistakes.
Rosenberg's approach is close to that of an active stock-picker, rather than
that of the typical quantitative investment manager.
His computer sifts the details of individual companies in search of
undervalued stocks, using an extensive historical database. The database is
the key to such computer-based investing: Rosenberg's firm has just spent
three years building a database of 28,000 European companies to add to its
existing US and Far Eastern systems.
The 'bottom-up' technique sets Rosenberg apart from most active quantitative
managers, who start with a portfolio that matches a particular index and
then 'tilt' it towards particular characteristics to try to outperform the
index.
The Rosenberg system looks at the fundamentals which should affect a
company's performance in different circumstances, and tries to assess how
the market is likely to appraise the fundamentals.
Theory suggests, for instance, that cash on a company's balance sheet is
worth less to investors than its face value, due to the tax that would have
to be deducted if it was paid out. In practice, though, each dollar of cash
held by a company is always valued by the stock market at more than a
dollar: the sight of cash gives investors confidence. This is especially
true during a recession, when the stock market valuation of Dollars 1 of
cash typically rises to Dollars 1.45, says Rosenberg.
It is assessments like these, drawn from historic experience, and the
consistent, systematic and comprehensive approach which are meant to give
the computer its edge. Rosenberg targets a return of 4 per cent over
whatever benchmark his computer is measured against, and is paid on results.
The 1990s have not been kind to this method. The Rosenberg computer
underperformed by between 4 per cent and 5 per cent for two years running.
'Our system was not as wise as we would have liked,' says Mr Rosenberg
ruefully, though he claims to have emerged with a more robust model.
The computer proved incapable of anticipating how both companies and
investors would behave in the depths of the US recession. For a start, it
produced a weighting towards companies which exhibited balance sheet
strength.
Many of these companies, says Rosenberg, reported one-off charges or other
non-recurring items as they used the recession to reduce staff or otherwise
rationalise their businesses. Stronger companies were best able to take
these charges, and so suffered some of the biggest earnings reductions.
The computer also failed to predict how investors would flee into what they
saw as 'quality' stocks. The portfolio of stocks it selected may have
exhibited adequate risk-diversification qualities according to modern
portfolio theory, but that is of little use if the bulk of investors choose
to act 'irrationally' - that is, in a different way than the one predicted
in the text books.
Do these experiences invalidate the use of computers, at least as applied by
Rosenberg? Not necessarily. His system has achieved an average
outperformance of 2 per cent a year over the past eight years, even after
the bad years. It is also 'learning': earnings forecasts have been added to
the system, along with a model which attempts to analyse market sentiment.
'If you can think of a reason to override the system, then you should make
the system better,' says Rosenberg.

FT  04 MAY 93 / US Money and Credit: Prices marked higher as fears of
inflation subside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US bond market has been lacking direction for several weeks now. Last
week, as little categorical information emerged on either the political or
economic fronts, there was no reason for this to change.
With all sorts of political question marks hanging over the Clinton economic
package, traders attempted to focus on more tangible data about the
economy's progress. For the first four trading sessions, this was mildly
discouraging.
The gold price rally spurred fears that inflation may be creeping back into
the system, while the consumer confidence figures for April showed a fairly
significant rise, reinforcing this impression.
By Thursday night, the yield on the benchmark 30-year long bond had risen
from 6.79 per cent at the end of the previous week, back to 6.91 per cent.
But on Friday, bond prices suddenly reversed direction, taking heed of the
Commerce Department's latest report on gross domestic product. This showed
the value of goods and services produced in the US advanced at an annualised
rate of 1.8 per cent in the first quarter 1993.
This compared with the significant 4.7 per cent rate seen in the last
quarter of 1992. For bond traders, it was confirmation the steam had gone
out of the recovery, and that the trek out of recession would be slow,
uphill work.
With the embryonic inflation fears temporarily allayed, traders marked bond
prices higher, pushing down yields. The long bond ended at 103 1/32 , up by
almost half a point, where it yielded 6.88 per cent.
The coming week, however, may be more testing. Friday will bring the April
jobs data, widely expected to show a rebound for the weather-depressed slide
in the previous month. The question is, how big will the revival be?
The consensus centres on a fairly modest recovery, coming mainly in the
construction sector and with manufacturing employment growth remaining
lacklustre. Most pundits are predicting the overall unemployment rate will
be unchanged at 7 per cent. However, any significant progress in the jobs
market could reawaken the inflation fears.
On a different front, bond traders must also absorb the Treasury's plans for
this month's quarterly auction and its related report on how its borrowing
costs can be reduced.
Most traders agree the report will focus on the role which longer-dated
securities - and the 30-year long bond in particular - will play in the
government's future funding efforts. In an effort to prune borrowing costs,
the Treasury could choose to issue more shorter-dated, low-yielding
securities.
If so, smaller auctions of 30-year bonds could tighten the market for the
stock and push prices higher.
That said, treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen has pledged there will be no
radical change - although he has never specified exactly what this might
mean, and there are strong political reasons for saving the maximum number
of dollars this way. Conversely, with interest rates at a low ebb, this
could be a poor time in the interest rate cycle to start shortening the
maturity of government debt.
Analysts at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, for example, advise that the
30-year bond offering be reduced by Dollars 1bn to Dollars 8.25bn, the
10-year note by Dollars 500m to Dollars 10.25bn, and the size of the
three-year note issue be unchanged at Dollars 15.5bn - an overall package of
Dollars 34bn.
A WEAKER-than-expected purchasing managers' report boosted longer-dated US
Treasury prices yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. In late
trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  13/16 at 103 5/16
yielding 6.859 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up  3/32 at
100 7/32 , to yield 3.743 per cent.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Canadian Government Bonds: Buyers are undeterred by
uncertainties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Canadian bond market suffered its nastiest jolt for some time last week.
Long-term bond yields jumped more than one-third of a percentage point in a
single day after being hit first by unexpectedly mild spending cuts in the
federal budget, then by a domestic rating agency's downgrade of federal
government debt.
The question now is whether this setback to a market often seen as a
high-yielding surrogate for US Treasuries was a storm in a teacup, or the
precursor of a bumpy - and mostly downward - ride for the rest of the year.
Several forthcoming events could again unsettle Canadian bonds. All eyes are
on the Ontario provincial budget, due to be tabled in mid-May. The
provincial government has pledged a bracing combination of spending cuts and
higher taxes to contain a runaway budget deficit.
But the market remains unsure whether the social-democrat government will
deliver. A shortfall of more than CDollars 10bn-CDollars 12bn in the fiscal
year to March 31 1994 (last year's deficit was CDollars 11bn) could again
knock the wind out of all Canadian bonds.
Other uncertainties centre on the ruling Progressive Conservative party's
vote on June 13 for a successor to prime minister Brian Mulroney, and the
outcome of the general election which the new leader will call before the
end of autumn.
For the time being, however, evidence abounds that the market has put the
April 26 budget surprise behind it. Since the budget, 'all we've seen have
been buyers,' says one London-based securities dealer.
The gap between US and Canadian bonds, which widened sharply on the day
after the budget, is almost back to pre-budget levels. According to Royal
Bank of Canada, the five-year spread had narrowed to 182 basis points by
last Friday from a peak during the week of 226 points.
The market is rewarding those provinces which have brought down
belt-tightening budgets. The gap between 10-year provincial and government
of Canada yields has narrowed by 10-15 basis points over the past month.
Criticism of the federal budget is centred less on its contents than on the
expectations of deep spending cuts built up by finance minister Don
Mazankowski ahead of budget day.
Ms Anita Lauria, who covers Canada for Salomon Brothers in New York, says
projected annual spending increases of 1.7 per cent over the next five years
make the budget 'quite austere'. She notes that, despite this being an
election year, Mr Mazankowski neither lowered taxes nor pumped up government
outlays.
Canadian Bond Rating Service downgraded Ottawa's debt from Triple A to
Double A plus the day after the budget speech, but no other agency has so
far joined it or even put Canada on rating alert.
Mr Daniel Kelly, vice-president for fixed-income research at Wood Gundy in
Toronto, says that much will depend in coming weeks on the course of the
Canadian dollar. One positive sign was last Friday's report that Canada's
GDP grew by a seasonally-adjusted 0.4 per cent in February, equal to an
annual growth rate of about 4 per cent.
But few investors are likely to take a strong view on the direction of
either the dollar or bond prices until the Ontario budget is out of the way.

FT  04 MAY 93 / UK Gilts: Most investors continue to take bearish view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT SEEMS a neat conclusion to pin the blame for last week's dive in the UK
gilt market on a painful hangover after the Bank of England's Pounds 3bn
auction of five-year stock.
But two nagging doubts get in the way of this view. The first is the auction
was not as bad as all that. The second is there were plenty of other much
more serious reasons for the fall.
The auction of 7 1/4 per cent bonds due 1998 was covered 1.77 times, which
only looks weak in the light of some highly-optimistic estimates that it
would be at least three times covered. More sober commentators stayed in the
1.5 to 2 range.
A background of tight institutional cash-flow raises the question of where
this hypothetical Pounds 9bn of cash would have come from for three times
cover, especially as there was little reason to switch from UK equities to
gilts.
The answer was supposed to be: from overseas. But the evidence suggests
foreign investors had come into the market ahead of the auction, benefiting
from the strengthening of the pound from a low of DM2.32 in February.
By Wednesday, the attraction of UK gilts had diminished. The pound had risen
to about DM2.50 and a growing raft of upbeat economic news had doused hopes
of further interest rate cuts and reawakened fears of inflation.
This leads into the more serious concerns which increasingly undermined the
market throughout April.
At the beginning of the month, the June gilt futures contract hit a high
level of 107.16. But by Thursday it had shed four points, reflecting general
unease about the outlook for gilts.
The market is refocusing on the sheer size and duration of the debt
financing exercise. 'The age-old question is: who will buy Pounds 50bn of
gilts?' said Mr John Shepperd, an economist at SG Warburg.
He pointed out that the amount was roughly twice the estimated Pounds 25bn
to Pounds 30bn of domestic institutional cash flow this year. If overseas
investors were not active buyers of gilts, fears would be raised of a cash
crunch, he said.
To lure them in, yields - and yield spreads over the benchmark German bund -
will probably have to go up.
Mr Ifty Islam, an economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, predicted that the
yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt would continue to rise from 8.1 per cent
at the end of the week to 8.3 per cent in June.
If this provided a gilt-bund yield spread of 150 basis points, it would
attract overseas inflows.
Currency movements were a crucial factor. 'When sterling was at DM2.32, a
gilt-bund spread of 100 basis points would probably have been sufficient
given the cheapness of the currency,' Mr Islam said.
Apart from the supply headache, two other factors are bugging the market.
The first is the string of good news on the economy.
Last week, GDP figures showed non-oil growth of 0.6 per cent in the first
quarter over the last quarter of 1992. Then the Confederation of British
Industry reported a surge in business confidence to its highest level for 10
years. This came on top of previous upbeat headlines about unemployment and
retail sales.
This is seen as all but ruling out a further cut in the base rate from 6 per
cent, although some economists feel this bearish assumption for the gilt
market has been overdone.
Worse still, it has reawakened fears in the fixed income market of
inflation.
As one marketmaker said: 'Can the government control the economy so that we
can have non-inflationary, sustainable growth? The answer is no.'
Not everyone agrees with that answer. But the question 'will it be different
this time?' is a universal one. Those with a rosier view of the inflation
outlook point to such comfort factors as high unemployment, lower earnings
growth and under-used capacity.
What emerged last week is that the bears have it for the time being. After
the futures contract fell through its key support level at 104.30, a new
floor of 102.1 was being suggested.

3M, the US manufacturer of adhesives, magnetic tapes and other industrial
and consumer products, reported first-quarter earnings of Dollars 330m, or
Dollars 1.51 a share, up from Dollars 303m, or Dollars 1.30, last year.
Sales edged up to Dollars 3.52bn from Dollars 3.44bn in the quarter, while
operating earnings jumped to Dollars 530m, from last year's first-quarter
Dollars 509m.
The results were slightly higher than Wall Street's projections of Dollars
1.50 a share.
Mr LD DeSimone, chairman, said the company's largest US business sector,
industrial and consumer products, saw a 10 per cent volume gain in the first
quarter. Total US volume gained 7 per cent in the quarter, while
international sales grew by about 6 per cent.

<TEXT>
NORTHWEST Airlines, the fourth largest US carrier which is currently
integrating operations with Europe's KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, announced
yesterday that it had secured an 'agreement in principle' with two major
unions over key work-rule and pay concessions.
Details of the agreement, which is subject to ratification, were not made
public. However, two months ago, Northwest offered employees a 20 per cent
equity interest in the company if they would provide cost savings of about
Dollars 883m over a three-year period. The cost-savings were seen as
critical to the US airline's future, and there has been speculation that it
might file for bankruptcy protection if the wage concessions were not
forthcoming.
Yesterday's deal was struck with the International Association of Machinists
and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, representing the mechanics
and flight attendants respectively. The major employee group which has not
yet struck a deal is the Air Line Pilots Association. Three other unions
also remain in negotiation with the carrier.

Hafnia Holding's equity capital was turned from a positive DKr3.12bn at the
end of 1991 to a negative DKr4.13bn last year, while assets tumbled from
DKr9.48bn to DKr2.40bn.
Hafnia's collapse was caused by its investments in Baltica, its Danish

Creditors in Hafnia Holding are due to meet on May 6 to decide whether to
force the company into bankruptcy.
Among the biggest creditors are Den Dansk Bank and Germany's Commerz bank.

INDEPENDENT directors of Kodak, the US film-to-pharmaceuticals group,
yesterday issued a statement of support for Mr Kay Whitmore, the embattled
chairman, but also insisted the company's performance 'must be improved
significantly', writes Martin Dickson in New York.
The statement followed a plunge in Kodak's share price last week when Mr
Christopher Steffen, its new chief financial officer, quit after just 11
weeks because of differences with Mr Whitmore.
Kodak's outside directors said yesterday the board expected management to
submit a comprehensive plan, including expense and debt reduction and
strategic focus, between now and September.
They said they were committed to achieving 'significantly greater
shareholder value in 1993 and beyond' and fully supported the efforts of Mr
Whitmore and senior managers to accomplish this.

dividend

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL, the German tyre company, has decided it would be 'premature' to
pay its shareholders a dividend for 1992, in spite of a return to
profitability after steep losses in 1991.
The company said yesterday that in view of the difficult economic climate
shareholders would be better served if profits were transferred to reserves.
This will be the second successive year shareholders will receive no
dividend.
Continental reported net group profits for last year of DM133m (Dollars
82.6m) after a loss of DM128.2m in 1991. The parent company made a profit of
DM38m, against a loss of DM417.1m the previous year.
The profits turnround was expected, but the figures imply a sharp downturn
in the second half of last year as Continental made profits of DM118m in the
first six months of 1992 alone.
Mr Gunter Sieber is resigning his post as board member responsible for
passenger vehicles due to 'differences of business policy'. He is being
replaced by Mr Wilhelm Schafer, previously chief executive of Semperit
Reifen in Austria.

the CarnaudMetalBox packaging group, has raised FFr338.55m (Dollars 62.5m)
by selling part of its stake in Cap Gemini Sogeti, the French computer
services concern.
Proceeds of the sale, announced last month on publication of 1992 results,
will be used to finance the FFr1bn deal in which CGIP raised its holding in
CarnaudMetalBox to 32.3 per cent from 25.3 per cent by buying shares from
MB-Caradon, the UK building products group. CGIP has sold half its shares in
Cap Gemini, representing 4.41 per cent of the latter's equity. It sold 1.85m
shares, reportedly to Merrill Lynch, at FFr183 each. The Cap Gemini stake
was valued in CGIP's accounts at FFr192m.

FT  04 MAY 93 / International Company News: Matif to list on Globex

<TEXT>
THE Matif, the French futures exchange, will list its French government bond
futures and options contracts on Globex, the after-hours trading system, on
May 13, writes Tracy Corrigan.
The launch of the so-called 'notionnel' contract, the world's second-largest
interest rate contract, was postponed in March due to intermittent
disconnections of Globex screens in Paris, but this problem has now been
largely solved by Reuters, the service provider, according to the Matif.
Euroclear and Cedel, the two European clearing houses, have set a new target
date of September 17 for the implementation of the electronic bridge - the
mechanism by which settlement is exchanged between the two systems.
They will miss a June deadline due to further delays in testing.
The new bridge is expected to save the market between Dollars 30m and
Dollars 40m a year.

FT  04 MAY 93 / International Company News: Ems-Chemie offers to repurchase
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMS-CHEMIE, the speciality chemical group led by the controversial Swiss
politician Mr Christoph Blocher, is offering to buy back and cancel up to 36
per cent of its bearer shares for SFr550m (Dollars 383.5m).
The move is the latest in the group's unusual strategy of distributing
excess cash flow. Mr Blocher is sceptical of acquisitions and
diversification and believes the company should stick to its business,
rather than be a fund manager as well.
Last year, the group repaid a portion of the nominal value of the bearer
shares to shareholders in lieu of a dividend.
This year's buy-back offer, also in lieu of a dividend, takes advantage of
last year's revisions to Swiss company law permitting such purchases.
The offer, at SFr2,200 per share for up to 250,000 of the 689,646 bearer
shares, represents a SFr200 premium on the market price at Friday's close.
BZ Bank Zurich, which is advising Ems, said the offer would not be of
interest to individual shareholders because they would have to pay 35 per
cent withholding tax on the difference between the buy-back price and the
SFr100 nominal value of the shares.
Corporations pay tax only on the difference between book value and the offer
price.
Individuals could realise the offer premium without having to face a heavy
tax burden by selling in the market.
If the offer were fully subscribed, Mr Blocher's share of the capital, in
the form of registered shares, would rise from 18.45 per cent to 26.2 per
cent and his voting power from 53.1 per cent to 64 per cent.

FT  04 MAY 93 / International Company News: Gerstner lures Chrysler finance
chief to IBM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR LOU Gerstner, the new chairman of International Business Machines,
yesterday made his first top-level executive appointment by naming Mr Jerry
York, chief financial officer of Chrysler, to the same position at IBM.
Mr York, 54, has been chief financial officer of Chrysler since May 1990 and
has played an important role in the carmaker's successful efforts to cut
operating costs by Dollars 3bn, sell non-core assets, issue some Dollars 3bn
in equity and re-negotiate its credit agreements  - all in the midst of a
severe motor industry recession.
He is well respected on Wall Street, where analysts said his experience
would be extremely valuable at IBM, which is struggling to cut costs and
return to profitability after two years of heavy losses.
Mr York, who becomes a senior vice-president of IBM, is the first person
selected by Mr Gerstner for his corporate management team.
Mr Gerstner, former chairman of foods and tobacco group RJR Nabisco, took
over as as chairman and chief executive of IBM on April 1. He replaced Mr
John Akers, who retired early because of the group's financial problems.
Mr Frank Metz, IBM chief financial officer, retired in January and had been
replaced on a temporary basis by Mr Paul Rizzo, who returned to the group
from retirement.
IBM announced last week Mr Rizzo would remain at the company as
vice-chairman and would be responsible for manufacturing and development
operations on an interim basis.
Mr Gerstner said: 'Jerome York not only has extensive financial experience,
but he has a significant background in operations as well.
'He has helped lead Chrysler's cost-reduction programmes while successfully
managing the company's overall financial portfolio. He will be a valuable
member of our team.'
Mr York, who worked for Ford and General Motors early in his career, joined
Chrysler in 1980.

FT  04 MAY 93 / International Company News: Austrian banks in takeover
struggle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITANSTALT-Bankverein, Austria's second-largest bank, is in a stiff fight
for its independence following a hostile takeover bid launched last Friday
by Raiffeisen Zentralbank Oesterreich (RZB), the clearing house for a large
group of rural Austrian savings banks.
RZB said it had offered to buy at least half of the 70 per cent voting stake
in Creditanstalt (CA) held by the Austrian Ministry of Finance.
It would propose then to sell itself to CA in return for enough shares to
give the Raiffeisen a majority holding - in effect, a reverse takeover.
The proposed merger would create Austria's largest bank, with assets of
Sch703bn (Dollars 63.2bn), compared with the Sch544bn balance sheet of Bank
Austria, itself the result of a merger in September 1991 between Landerbank
and the Zentralsparkasse group of savings banks.
Both CA and the Raiffeisen have large non-banking activities, CA mainly in
industry and the Raiffeisen in insurance and retailing.
CA said in a terse statement it did not see 'any compelling need for growth
via mergers'.
The bid comes against the background of a long period of severe trading
conditions in the Austrian banking industry and the need to reduce the
excessive number of banks, branches and employees in the largely
publicly-owned sector. The country has one bank branch for every 1,340
people, more than double the ratio in the UK.
The pressure for rationalisation has been intensified by the government's
desire to sell its holdings of bank shares and to liberalise laws and
regulations affecting banks.
The Raiffeisen, with 1,700 outlets and only Sch185bn in assets, is one of
the groups most in need of rationalisation. CA, by contrast, has only 201
outlets and assets of Sch518bn in assets. However, it has been hard hit by
loan losses in recent years, initially in international lending, but
latterly in the domestic market. Its provisions last year amounted to
Sch5.7bn.
The government has been searching for strategic partners for CA, and last
year there were contacts with General Electric of the US. Mr Guido
Schmidt-Chiari, CA's executive chairman, has said he would prefer to see the
government's stake dispersed among institutional investors.

FT  04 MAY 93 / International Company News: IRI moves to ease financial
problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company, has taken a further step to
alleviate its financial difficulties with a L600bn (Dollars 402m)
cash-for-dividends and tax-credits deal with a group of banks.
The transaction involves tax credits on 1.5bn ordinary shares in IRI's Stet
telecommunications subsidiary.
In return for making over the dividends and associated tax credits until the
end of 1995, IRI will receive around L600bn.
The transaction is similar but almost twice the size of a similar deal
agreed in March involving tax credits on shares in Banca Commerciale
Italiana, the large bank controlled by IRI. In that instance, the taker for
the tax-credits was Stet.
Separately, Stet reported yesterday that group net profits rose marginally
to L1,425bn last year from L1,413bn in 1991.
Group sales climbed sharply to L27,167bn from L22,946bn. Parent company
profits rose marginally to L775bn from L761bn in 1991.
The group is paying an unchanged dividend of L100 a share for ordinary
shares and L120 a share for savings stock.
Stet said although earnings last year had been affected by the recession,
investments remained at L10,637bn. Net group debts amounted to L22,916bn
last year.
The latest tax-credits deal involves four banks, only two of which come from
within the IRI group.
The four takers are BCI and Credito Italiano (both controlled by IRI), Banco
Ambrosiano Veneto and Carimonte Banca.
As with its previous deal involving shares in its subsidiary, IRI stressed
the transaction was of limited duration, and could be cancelled by either
side prior to the agreed termination date.
IRI is planning an ambitious disposal plan to raise cash to reduce group
debts of over L70,000bn.
However, the group has been severely criticised for using 'financial
engineering', involving deals such as that on shares in its subsidiaries,
instead of pushing ahead with asset sales.

Benchmark Group, the property investor, incurred a loss of Pounds 1.39m
pre-tax for the half year ended December 31 compared with Pounds 1.75m
previously.
The deficit was struck after taking account of an exceptional provision of
Pounds 926,000 (Pounds 1.6m) against properties sold. A fall in turnover to
Pounds 1.48m (Pounds 8.07m) reflected the disposal in July of the banking
division.
Extraordinary charges of Pounds 1.69m (Pounds 3.3m) left a retained deficit
of Pounds 3.08m (Pounds 5.05m). Losses per share emerged at 0.87p (1.08p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gieves Group, the retailer and publisher, may have to make a provision in
its results for the year to January 31 because Redwood Press, a former
subsidiary, has been placed in administration.
Within the sale agreement terms of March last year, under which Gieves sold
Redwood to BPMG, Gieves continued to provide guarantees on certain
outstanding leasing and hire purchase obligations relating to printing
equipment used by Redwood.
The amounts outstanding at January 31 were Pounds 3.5m, of which BPMG
provided counter indemnities to Gieves in respect of 42 per cent of the
outstanding amount.
Gieves' directors believe there is a likelihood its contingent liabilities
under the guarantees will crystallise and a provision will have to be made.
The results will also contain a substantial provision in respect of the
write-down of assets employed after closing the Milan store.

MIDLAND Independent Newspapers, publisher of the Birmingham Post and Mail,
will today announce a multi-million pound deal to buy 10 free newspaper
titles in the East Midlands from the Thomson Free Newspapers group, writes
Raymond Snoddy.
The agreement in principle is the latest sign of expansion at MIN since the
Pounds 125m management buy-out from Ingersoll Newspapers in November 1991
and will give the group titles in all areas of the East and West Midlands.
Last year MIN, the main business of which includes the Sunday Mercury and
Coventry Evening Telegraph as well as the Post and Mail, acquired 18 titles
and launched five more.
The group will also announce today an increase in operating profit on its
newspaper activities from Pounds 5.8m to Pounds 13.2m in the year to
December.

WE'RE THE most efficient coal miners in the country,' boasts Richard Budge
as he strides, a hard-hatted burly figure, across the Northumberland
countryside.
Before him lies a gigantic hole in the ground. At the bottom, a 1,600-ton
dragline scoops up dirt in 50-ton bucketfuls. Dump trucks capable of
carrying 185 tons at a time growl their way along muddy tracks. This is
Colliersdean, one of the UK's largest open cast mines, operated on behalf of
British Coal by RJB Mining, Mr Budge's company.
Over the past month, scores of City visitors have come to peer into its grey
depths as a prelude to the flotation of RJB on the Stock Exchange. The
pathfinder prospectus is due out later this week.
Mr Budge's boast may not seem too startling in an industry where British
Coal sets the pace. And even if RJB's Pounds 100m worth of high grade
equipment enables it to compete with imported coal, what future is there in
a business seemingly in such steep decline?
The answer, according to Mr Budge, is that the government's White Paper, far
from sounding the death knell of coal, will open up big opportunities for
the efficient producer. He believes that RJB can grow even as the UK coal
industry shrinks to maybe only half of its former size.
RJB was born as a separate company only a year ago, when it emerged through
a management buy-out from AF Budge, a construction and mining company run by
Mr Budge's older brother Tony, since placed in receivership.
The Pounds 106m deal was financed by Schroder Ventures (about 50 per cent),
Charterhouse (25 per cent), Midland Montagu (5 per cent), with Mr Budge
owning 20 per cent, and the rest of management a small fraction.
The company now operates 11 open cast sites, nine of them on behalf of
British Coal, and two in its own right. It also has two underground mines,
and various ancillary activities such as coal washing.
Last year's turnover amounted to Pounds 73m. The operating profit was Pounds
16.4m, but the cost of financing the buy-out debt reduced the pre-tax profit
to Pounds 11m. The after-tax result was Pounds 7.3m.
But though these figures point to a strong financial performance, how will
the market react to a company in a waning industry, subject to political and
environmental pressures, to say nothing of foreign producers mining thick
seams at a fraction of the cost?
Mr Budge, who is 46, has a jovial disregard for these objections. His vision
of the future rests on the many advantages which he thinks the upheavals in
coal can bring to companies like RJB.
The first is that laws restricting the size of the private coal industry
will be lifted - as promised in the White Paper. These currently limit the
output of mines to 250,000 tonnes, and the number of men underground to 150.
The second is that the private sector will be allowed to bid for mines which
British Coal intends to close down. Mr Budge says he has his eye on 11 of
these, though he declines to identify them ahead of the purchase
negotiations.
The third is that RJB can be a lot more efficient than British Coal, and
thus transform British Coal's uneconomic pits into money-spinners. As an
example, he cites the Blenkinsopp colliery in Cumbria, which RJB bought in
1990. At the time, the two pits there were producing 80,000 tonnes a year
with a workforce of 76. They now produce 160,000 tonnes with 90 men.
Open cast mining also represents the low-cost end of the business. A pit
like Colliersdean produces coal at 80p a gigajoule, compared with between
Pounds 1 and Pounds 1.20 for imported coal, and Pounds 1.33 to Pounds 1.51
for coal sold to electricity generators under long-term contract.
Although environmentalists are trying to get open cast mining stopped, the
White Paper says permission should not be withheld from economic pits. Open
cast coal is also needed to blend with deep mined coal.
The fourth is that the private sector will be able to expand its sales to
the electricity generation industry. Mr Budge has his eye on a share of the
8m to 12m tonnes a year of additional coal which the generators are expected
to buy over and above the five-year contracts which have already been
negotiated.
This supplementary coal would attract the promised government subsidy. But
Mr Budge also sees prospects for expanding sales to the domestic, industrial
and smokeless fuel markets - and even forging a direct business link with a
power generator.
RJB expects to be selling between 600,000 and 700,000 tonnes of coal by
1995, up from 350,000 to 450,000 this year. The growth prospects for the
company thus depend greatly on Mr Budge's success in seizing the new
opportunities.
But the prospectus will not flesh them out in detail. Mr Budge says he wants
investors to judge the company on its current merits, and make their own
assessments about what the future might hold.
Mr Nigel Hawkins, utilities analyst at Hoare Govett, says that RJB's
expansion plans face significant hurdles, for example in obtaining planning
consent for mines, and negotiating the legal complexities of buying
redundant pits from British Coal.
The flotation is expected to value the company at between Pounds 100m and
Pounds 110m. This would pay off some of the venture capitalists and allow
the company to get its gearing down to the 30 to 40 per cent which Mr Budge
is aiming for.
The prospectus will make clear that the flotation is not intended to raise
funds for future acquisitions, so investors should expect to be approached
again if there is a big deal in the offing.

FT  04 MAY 93 / International Company News: Kleinwort looks outside for new
chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KLEINWORT Benson, the merchant banking group, is to look outside for a new
chief executive to replace Mr Jonathan Agnew.
Mr Agnew is leaving this summer by agreement with Kleinwort's new chairman,
Lord Rockley.
The company yesterday declined to comment on Mr Agnew's departure.
However, it is thought to have been agreed with Lord Rockley following his
dec-ision that the group needs a fresh strategy to take it forward.
Mr Agnew has been chief executive of Kleinwort Benson for the past five
years, and has overseen its attempt to build securities operations on top of
its traditional banking business following the Big Bang City deregulation.
Lord Rockley is thought to have decided to look outside the group for a
chief executive, although the deputy chairman, Mr Simon Robertson, is
expected to be given a strong role in establishing a long-term strategy for
the group.
No announcement of the change has yet been made to the group's staff,
although they are expected to be informed officially of Mr Agnew's departure
today.
The group is keen to dispel any suggestion of him being forced out.
Mr David Peake, its former chairman, retired at the group's annual meeting
last week, and handed responsibility to Lord Rockley. He said at the group's
preliminary results that he had been thinking about retiring 'for some
months'.
Kleinwort's pre-tax profits recovered last year, after a drop in bad debt
provisions from Pounds 39m to Pounds 7m, by 66 per cent to Pounds 46.3m.
Attributable profits rose by 10 per cent to Pounds 21.3m.
Although the group has developed under Mr Agnew, it now lags well behind SG
Warburg in market value.
Lord Rockley is thought to want to find ways of integrating the various
operations more effectively in future.
The group, which made a loss in 1990, is 6.6 per cent owned by American
International Group, the US insurance company, while Banque Nationale de
Paris holds 4.7 per cent.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Tough time making a level playing field: Richard Waters on
moves to put the world's financial centres on an even footing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL agreements between financial regulators are seldom what they
appear. Ostensibly devised to ensure the integrity of international markets
or reinforce the financial system against unexpected shocks, they are often
the result of a quite different motivation: the desire by heavily-regulated
nations to prevent companies in lightly-regulated ones from gaining an
advantage in international markets.
Last week's proposals from the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision on the
market risks run by banks fit the usual pattern. Laying down common minimum
capital levels for banks which trade equities, debt and foreign exchange, as
well as the derivatives which have grown up around these core markets, has
obvious prudential attractions.
However, the move springs at least as much from a drive to put the world's
main financial centres on an equal footing. Securities firms in London in
particular have long enjoyed a lighter capital regime than elsewhere.
The Basle Committee's last attempt at international harmonisation - the 1988
accord which established an 8 per cent minimum capital level to back credit
risks - was motivated by similar concerns. By forcing Japanese banks in
particular to back their loans with more capital, the accord helped more
heavily capitalised banks to maintain their position in international
banking markets. Establishing the same 'level playing field' in other
financial markets is proving more difficult.
The Basle Committee had hoped to reach a common agreement on market risk
with the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco), which
represents securities regulators. This would have led to a common framework
for commercial banks as well as investment banks and securities houses.
That plan foundered last year when Mr Richard Breeden, outgoing head of the
US's Securities and Exchange Commission, vetoed the proposals on the grounds
that they were too lax. Making the playing field more uneven is a European
Community directive on capital adequacy for both banks and securities firms,
agreed last year.
The result is a mess: securities firms outside the EC will not have to
adhere to any international guidelines, while banks inside it will have to
meet two different sets of rules for measuring market risk.
In at least two respects, the Basle rules have been pitched at a more
stringent level than the EC's directive. Foreign exchange risks - against
which banks previously have not had to provide any capital at all - will eat
up more capital.
Also, the 'specific risk' in equities (the risk that a particular stock will
fall in relation to the market, as distinct from the general market risk
that all prices will fall) will need 4 per cent capital backing, rather than
the 2 per cent required by the EC.
The complex rules apply different risk-measurement systems to debt, equities
and foreign exchange. They also recognise different methods of measuring
risk for the same instruments, particularly when it comes to derivatives:
banks which have invested in sophisticated risk-management systems will be
able to use these in determining the risk they report for regulatory
purposes, provided they are approved by national regulators.
However, Mr Gerald Corrigan, chairman of the New York Fed and of the Basle
Committee, concedes: 'No regime is capable of capturing all of the
activities and trading strategies that individual institutions use.'
The treatment of even relatively familiar practices could arouse opposition.
For instance, banks involved in stock index arbitrage - which involves
taking opposite positions in a stock index future and the underlying stocks
 -are allowed a concessionary 2 per cent capital weighting on each leg of
the transaction, adding up to 4 per cent overall, even though an effective
arbitrage trade can leave a bank with no market risk.
It is the treatment of strategies like these, and the many situations in
which banks use positions in different financial markets partially to offset
one another, that will determine just how hard the Basle rules bite.
Meanwhile, banking regulators are holding out the hope of renewed agreement
with securities regulators before the Basle rules come into force, which
will not be until 1997 at the earliest.
The European directive provides for a review of EC law after three years.
However, the prospect of revising the rules to conform with tougher
requirements from Basle fills securities regulators with horror. 'We
certainly don't want to have to re-open the directive,' one said.
Whatever agreement is reached, the playing field will continue to look
uneven. Banks will have to put up capital to reflect the effect that changes
in interest rates will have on their holdings of debt securities, but will
not have to take similar steps to guard against interest rate risks in their
normal banking operations. This could help to reverse the bias in regulation
in recent years that has encouraged the securitisation of bank assets.
Instead, the Basle Committee last week published a paper proposing a common
method for measuring a bank's overall interest-rate risk.
While the latest Basle proposals may have wide-ranging and as yet
unpredictable effects on banks' activities in the financial markets, they
seem unlikely to have as profound an effect as the 1988 capital accord. That
agreement helped to stem the growth of credit markets as banks sought to
strengthen their capital bases. A similar damping of activity is unlikely.
However, the proposals could change the way banks trade for their own
account. As Mr Corrigan says: 'I would hope they would work in the direction
of encouraging more conservative trading strategies and appr- oaches as they
pertain to banks' proprietary trading activities.'

FT  04 MAY 93 / Economics Notebook: Pension funds can rock the financial
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEIR role in society is invaluable. We depend on them for our security in
old age. But pension funds have also emerged as one of the great potential
destabilising forces in the world's financial markets.
Last week in Washington, finance ministers and senior officials from the
world's leading industrial countries took time out from their everyday
pre-occupations to ponder some of the lessons of last autumn's crisis on the
world's currency markets.
Their conclusions - summed up in a communique by the Group of Ten industrial
countries - amounted to little. But that should cause no surprise. Two
studies - one by staff of the International Monetary Fund* and another by
senior G10 officials chaired by Mr Lamberto Dini of the Bank of Italy -
served to highlight the powerlessness of governments and central banks in
the face of massive currency movements.
A quick statistical overview of the foreign exchange market shows what
problems governments face.
Daily foreign exchange transactions have grown rapidly over the past decade,
fuelled by the liberalisation of capital markets, technological advance in
computers and telecommunications and the rapid expansion of the amount of
funds managed by institutional investors.
As a result, daily net turnover of the nine biggest foreign exchange markets
totalled Dollars 910bn (Pounds 590bn) last year, a sum much higher than the
total non-gold reserves of all the industrial countries. According to the
IMF, these totalled Dollars 555.6bn in April 1992.
The total reserves of the industrial countries are also dwarfed by the
volume of financial assets held by foreign investors.
Total cross-border equity holdings in the US, Europe and Japan increased
from Dollars 800bn in 1986 to Dollars 1,300bn in 1991 while the IMF
estimates that the total cross-border ownership of tradeable securities has
increased to Dollars 2,500bn.
Institutional investors, of which pension funds are the most important, have
played a prominent role in this process of portfolio diversification. In
Europe, institutions invest about 20 per cent of their assets abroad while
foreign investments of US and Japanese institutions generally range between
5 and 7 per cent.
These relatively modest sounding percentages can translate into potentially
large financial flows. US pension funds, for example, had invested just 4.6
per cent of their assets abroad in 1991. But these were worth Dollars 125bn.
Similarly, the 6.6 per cent of assets invested outside the US by American
mutual funds was worth Dollars 90bn.
Moreover, the IMF and Dini reports both predict that the trend to
international portfolio diversification will keep growing. The IMF quotes
research by InterSec Research Corporation, a company that tracks pension
fund investments worldwide. This estimates that the share of foreign
currency denominated assets in the portfolios of the world's 300 largest
pension funds will increase from about 7 per cent at present to about 12 per
cent by the middle of this decade.
If true, global pension fund assets will rise to around Dollars 7,200bn by
1996, of which Dollars 880bn will be cross-border investments.
US pension funds are projected to double the share of foreign securities in
total assets to 10 per cent by the mid-1990s.
Such portfolio diversification can be a tremendous force for good in the
world. By putting resources where they are needed, the investment of savings
from mature industrialised countries in higher-yielding opportunities abroad
should bring benefits to both the investing and the host countries.
But the sheer scale of the present and prospective investment flows is also
a big headache for governments, particularly as institutions which used to
invest for the long term are taking advantage of improved liquidity in
financial markets and falling costs of financial transactions to switch in
and out of currencies and their derivative securities.
Rapid action is not just the preserve of the hedge funds, such as those run
by Mr George Soros which shot to prominence in the attack on sterling last
September. These privately subscribed funds, which are mostly based in
unregulated offshore centres, are notable for their ability to take highly
speculative, leveraged positions in currencies.
The Dini report notes that some pension funds have also started to treat
foreign exchange as an asset class in itself, separate from any debt or
equity security.
According to the IMF, 'relationship buy-and-hold finance is giving way to
transactions-driven finance, leading to the observation that it is no longer
clear what a 'long term investment' means'.
All this is bad news for governments. When private markets change their mind
about a currency, a defending central bank can be faced with a run of
Dollars 100bn to Dollars 200bn in a week and run out of reserves.
But it is a sign of the dilemma faced by monetary authorities that the Dini
report was unable to come up with any clear recommendations for dealing with
these problems.
It talks in a 'motherhood and apple pie' sort of way about the need for
close consultations among governments, sound policies at home and
co-operation among countries to ensure that interest rates changes or
intervention to protect currencies are as effective as possible. But at one
point it acknowledges that 'a country can experience downward pressure on
its currency despite the fact that its macroeconomic policy and performance
have been sound'.
A case in point was France last year which eventually fought off speculation
against the French franc and and forced losses estimated at Dollars 1bn on
speculators in the process.
But although the French franc is doing well in the honeymoon period after
the centre-right government's sweeping election victory, few foreign
exchange operators are yet willing to give it a competely clean bill of
health.

FT  04 MAY 93 / EC set to reclaim Klockner-Werke loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is poised to demand the full recovery of its DM175m
(Pounds 71m) loan to Klockner-Werke, the German steel and engineering group
which filed for protection from its creditors in December.
The move, which is up for discussion at the full meeting of the EC executive
tomorrow threatens to push the Klockner group into outright bankruptcy.
Bankers to the group believe the EC's stance will lead to the unscrambling
of a complicated debt restructuring deal under which the bulk of the group's
creditors had agreed in principle to forgive DM1.4bn of the group's DM2.7bn
debt.
The restructuring plan was designed to guarantee survival of the group and
prevent problems of the steel businesses - Klockner Stahl and Klockner
Edelstahl - from dragging down Klockner's engineering subsidiaries.
The non-steel companies employ 25,000 out of the group's 33,000 workforce
and are not formally touched by the 'composition proceedings' which Klockner
has launched under German insolvency law. But three large German banks
warned in a letter to the commission yesterday that these jobs would be at
risk if the the EC called in its loan.
The EC, which granted the loan for investment purposes under the European
coal and steel treaty, ranks among Klockner's biggest creditors.
The biggest is Deutsche Bank, the group's house bank which is believed to be
owed DM450m.
Other leading creditors include the Westdeutsche Landesbank, state bank for
North-Rhine Westphalia, believed to be owed DM255m; Dresdner Bank, with
DM175m and the Bayerische Vereinsbank with DM150m.
Hard-line EC commissioners, believed to be in a majority, are demanding that
the Duisburg-based Klockner should not be given special treatment amid the
crisis afflicting the EC steel industry.
But bankers, including Mr Ulrich Cartellieri from the Deutsche Bank, said in
their letter yesterday that the bankruptcy of the group would give the
opportunity for rival steel manufacturers to buy Klockner's steel-works at
knock-down prices, thereby contributing to the glut of steel capacity in the
EC.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Four banks withdraw from BT share sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT least four European banks excluded from the global syndicate to market
the UK government's remaining BT share stake have withdrawn their support as
regional managers to the Pounds 5.5bn issue.
The banks, which include Kleinwort Benson the UK merchant bank, Banque
Nationale de Paris and Banque Indosuez of France and Enskilda of Sweden, are
understood to be unhappy at being prohibited from marketing to the 500
global institutions most likely to be interested in the issue.
Under the rules set by the SG Warburg, adviser to BT and global co-ordinator
for the sale of the 21.9 per cent stake, 11 global syndicate banks have been
given exclusive access to these institutions.
This structure moves away from previous practice.
Advisers hope the new structure will increase competition among the
co-ordinating banks - who will now compete with each other across national
boundaries - and maximise the return to the UK treasury.
While the 11 global syndicate banks will have exclusive access to these top
institutions, they will also be allowed to market to smaller investors.
Warburg has named as co-ordinating banks: Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Cazenove,
Daiwa Securities, Deutsche Bank, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, NatWest
Securities, Paribas Capital Markets, NM Rothschild and UBS Limited.
Warburg will be co-ordinating the global book-building exercise.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Sales fall puts Iveco in further big loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IVECO, the commercial vehicle subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, suffered a second
successive heavy loss last year in the face of the continuing steep fall in
west European truck sales.
Last year's loss of Fl 187m (Pounds 67m) was only marginally lower than the
loss of Fl 199m suffered in 1991.
Iveco is incorporated in the Netherlands.
Other leading European truck makers such as Volvo and Renault also suffered
substantial losses last year, while Daf of the Netherlands was forced into
receivership in February.
Iveco's loss last year was also cushioned by the one-off gain of around Fl
90m from the sale of a 51 per cent stake in its forklift truck subsidiary,
Fiat OM Carelli Elevatori, to Linde of Germany.
The group's financial performance in the past two years has been burdened by
the heavy launch costs for several truck ranges, which have been developed
as part of the group's ambitious five-year, L5,000bn (Pounds 2.1bn)
investment programme from 1988 to 1992 in new products and manufacturing
facilities.
Iveco's commercial vehicle sales fell by 6 per cent to 115,500 last year.
Sales in Europe fell by 9 per cent to 93,000, but this was compensated by a
14 per cent increase in sales outside Europe to 22,500.
Iveco sales volumes in the past three years have fallen by 21 per cent in
west Europe from 118,400 in 1989 and by 15 per cent worldwide from 136,100.
Demand continues to weaken and Iveco estimates European truck sales fell
again in the first two months of 1993, by around 28 per cent from the same
period a year ago.
The company suffered heavy losses last year in particular in Spain, where it
took over Enasa, the loss-making state-owned producer of Pegaso trucks in
1990, and in the UK, where it took over management control of the former
Ford truck operations in 1986.
Iveco Pegaso's net loss deepened to Pta32bn (Pounds 179m) from Pta20bn in
1991, while Iveco Ford truck's loss totalled Pounds 31m following losses of
Pounds 39m in 1991 and Pounds 20m in 1990.
Iveco Magirus, the group's German subsidiary, fell to a loss of DM56m
(Pounds 22m) from a profit of DM52m a year earlier.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Fresh doubts raised about US recovery
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH SIGNS of US economic weakness emerged yesterday with an unexpected
plunge in one of the key indicators for the manufacturing industry.
The Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 49.7 per cent in April against 53.4
per cent in March, partly as a result of a sudden drop in new orders.
This was the lowest reading since last September and far below the
projections of Wall Street analysts, who had expected a modest firming of
the index. A reading below 50 per cent is generally regarded as evidence
that the manufacturing sector is contracting.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said construction spending,
hit by severe winter weather, had fallen 0.8 per cent in March, the first
decline in seven months. Spending, however, remained 5 per cent higher than
in March last year.
The fall in the purchasing managers' index is significant because it
suggests that economic weakness in the first quarter carried over into
April. Last week the Commerce Department reported a sharp decline in
economic growth - to an annual rate of 1.8 per cent in the first quarter
compared with 4.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year.
'After sustaining a high level of growth for five months, new orders
collapsed,' said Mr Robert Bretz, a spokesman for national purchasing
managers. If orders did not revive, the 'current economic malaise' would
continue, he said.
The purchasing managers' new orders index fell to 51.1 per cent last month
against 58 per cent in March. The index for production fell to 51.8 per cent
compared with 57.4 per cent. Some relief, however, was provided by an
unexpected increase in the index for new export orders, which rose to 53.2
per cent against 49.9 per cent in March, despite the slowdown in Europe and
Japan.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Fear of unemployment still high: Nearly half of men worried
over job security - MORI survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 40 per cent of workers in Britain are worried they could find
themselves out of a job within the next 12 months, according to the first of
a monthly series of MORI surveys, published in the Financial Times today.
The survey findings about people's fears of losing their jobs come despite
recent, more encouraging, economic indicators, and optimistic messages from
government ministers emphasising signs of recovery.
There is a risk that concern about jobs could yet damp hopes that a marked
increase in consumer confidence will add momentum to the UK's emergence from
recession.
Those who felt the most vulnerable were men, people between the ages of 45
and 54, and C2s - skilled workers. Job insecurity was felt most strongly in
the south, particularly in greater London, and among full-time, rather than
part-time, employees.
The survey, which was commissioned from MORI by Industrial Relations
Services, the independent pay and conditions research group, should give
some indication each month of how far confidence is returning.
Official jobless figures fell in March by 26,000 to a seasonally adjusted
total of 2.94m. This second successive monthly fall took analysts by
surprise, and the government has warned it is still too early to tell if
unemployment has peaked.
The IRS/MORI index found 41 per cent of workers said they were concerned -
21 per cent were 'very concerned' and 20 per cent were 'fairly concerned' -
about the possibility of being made redundant or becoming unemployed over
the next 12 months.
A question asking why individuals were worried about losing their jobs drew
a range of answers. Changes in the National Health Service and uncertainties
arising out of hospitals moving to trust status were mentioned by some
health service employees. Other workers feared their companies would lose
contracts or would cut jobs after takeovers.
Nearly half of men, 46 per cent, were concerned about losing their jobs,
compared with 35 per cent of women. More than a quarter, 27 per cent, of
workers who were aged 45-54 said they were 'very concerned' about becoming
unemployed, compared with 17 per cent of those aged 25-34.
Professional and managerial employees were not spared anxiety: 28 per cent
of ABs feared for their jobs. However, nearly half - 48 per cent - of
skilled workers were worried they might lose their jobs in the next year. In
greater London, 46 per cent of workers were concerned for their jobs,
compared with 37 per cent in the north of England.
MORI interviewed 1,024 adults aged 18 and over in full- or part-time work,
face-to-face in their homes, across 147 constituency sampling points
throughout Britain on April 22-26. Data were weighted to match the profile
of the population.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Brighter outlook for Italy's PM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE OUTLOOK for Italy's week-old government led by Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi,
the prime minister, brightened yesterday in spite of growing tensions within
the two main parties supporting it.
The change came amid signs that Mr Vincenzo Visco and Mr Augusto Barbera,
two of the four ministers who resigned from the government last week, might
be reconsidering their decisions.
Mr Giorgio Benvenuto, the leader of the Socialist party, appealed to the
Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), the former communists, to reconsider its
opposition to Mr Ciampi.
Mr Visco and Mr Barbera, both PDS politicians, said their decisions would be
temporarily 'frozen' pending a decision by their party. Last night, the
party decided against supporting Mr Ciampi, but left open the door to
abstaining in a vote of confidence later this week.
The resignations came after parliament decided on Thursday to turn down the
request by Milan magistrates to lift the immunity of Mr Bettino Craxi, the
former Socialist leader, on several instances of alleged corruption. The
vote unleashed demonstrations throughout Italy and calls for immediate
parliamentary elections.
Separately yesterday, Mr Giulio Andreotti, the seven times prime minister
who is facing investigations for alleged links with the Mafia, said he would
ask the senate to lift his own immunity. He said he did not want the issue
to exacerbate Italy's political tensions.
A senate committee last week agreed to the request by Palermo magistrates
that Mr Andreotti's immunity be lifted, amid strong opposition from the
former premier, now a life senator.
Mr Andreotti's move and the mere survival of the government over the weekend
helped to lift sentiment in the share and currency markets. Equities rose
sharply in Milan, while the lira made up some of the ground lost against
other currencies.
However, the repercussions of the Craxi vote were still being felt among the
Socialists and Christian Democrats, the two main parties supporting the
four-party coalition government.
A number of leading Socialists, including Mr Giorgio Ruffolo, a former
environment minister and member of the senate, left the party at the weekend
in protest at the decision over Mr Craxi.

FT  04 MAY 93 / NatWest to launch German storecard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank is to introduce the storecard to Germany as part
of a fresh expansion by British financial services companies into
continental Europe.
The bank is setting up an operation to offer retailers the credit cards
under its Comfort brand, which operates in Holland and Belgium, it said
yesterday. The establishment of NatWest's German card company is expected to
employ about 300 people by 1997.
Although banks have been hit by high provisions against bad debts in
operations such as mortgage lending in France and Spain, they are keen to
offer British products such as store credit cards in markets where they are
less known.
NatWest said yesterday that the use of store credit cards, now the dominant
means of buying consumer durables such as washing machines and freezers in
the UK, had not yet developed in Germany, or some other European countries.
Mr John Morgan, marketing director of the personal finance operation of
NatWest's Lombard North Central finance house subsidiary, said the bank had
already received expressions of interest from some 3,000 German retailers.
NatWest will not charge German retailers for providing their branded credit
cards. Although the store's name appears on cards, the bank lends money and
makes interest charges on the amount borrowed, as well as assessing risks.
German retailers have until now relied on generic credit cards such as
MasterCard and Visa as well as debit cards. The transaction charges paid by
retailers each time one of these cards is used have acted as a disincentive.
NatWest said it was forming a venture called Comfort Card GMBH, based in
Dusseldorf. A similar operation opened in Holland in 1985 is used in 6,000
retail outlets, while NatWest opened a branch office in Belgium last year.
Mr Morgan said the bank had carefully researched the risks of bad debt in
Germany, and concluded that consumers were 'cautious about the way they
spend their money, and prudent in the need to repay what is borrowed'.
He said NatWest might extend branded cards to other EC countries.

FT  04 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Owners Abroad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies normally put on their best face during a hostile bid. But it now
appears Owners Abroad applied some thick make-up while fending off Airtours.
During the bid, Owners did not issue a profits forecast but made much of its
strong trading and the savings that would stem from its link-up with Thomas
Cook. Just weeks later it has been steering profit expectations lower.
Owners' shares have dropped 28 per cent since the bid failed.
A period of underperformance is common for companies which have escaped
takeover. Besides, tour operators' trading conditions are notoriously
volatile. Nevertheless, it is surprising how quickly Owners has changed its
tune. The costs of carrying extra aircraft through the winter are higher
than the market assumed. The rationalisation costs accompanying the Thomas
Cook alliance also appear unexpectedly large.
That must grate with shareholders. Owners' management has a history of
disappointment and there is now little prospect of a bidder salvaging the
share price should the company falter. Following its tender offer, Thomas
Cook accounts for 21 per cent of Owners' shares. That makes the company all
but impregnable.

FT  04 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Continental Airlines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Continental Airlines' emergence from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy procedure
raises intriguing valuation questions about the airline industry. A
mysterious Dollars 1.8bn intangible asset has popped up on the US carrier's
reconfigured balance sheet relating to the value of its routes and slots.
The item accounts for 37 per cent of the new entity's total assets. No value
was ascribed to the routes before.
There is nothing wrong with this from a technical accounting perspective. In
the US, route allocations are tradeable commodities which can legitimately
be capitalised. Three years ago United Airlines bought Pan Am's
international routes into Heathrow for Dollars 400m. It treats such route
acquisition costs as intangible assets and steadily depreciates them. The
surprising aspect to Continental's valuation is its scale and theoretical
nature. Such accounting inventions beg a string of questions about the
methods employed. What happens to route values if a more aggressive
competitor starts operating alongside? What would be the effect of a
revision of bilateral aviation agreements? US accounting rules recognise
such assets can be subject to 'permanent impairment' and should then be
written down. At a practical level, though, the debate quickly veers into
the farcical.
For European airlines, such issues are academic because routes are not
traded and thus not treated as intangible assets. Though a carrier's slots
are arguably its most precious asset, this is probably just as well. If it
applied the logic of the Continental valuation and the market worth
suggested by the United deal, British Airways could invent a value of more
than Dollars 5bn for its Heathrow slots. Sensibly it says it has no
intention of doing so.

FT  04 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Ladbroke
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since Ladbroke announced its results two months ago the shares have fallen
by 23 per cent. Clearly the fall-out from the Queens Moat debacle has cast a
pall over the leisure sector. Gun-shy investors are less inclined to give
complex groups like Ladbroke the benefit of the doubt in such tough times.
But there is more than poor sentiment at work. Ladbroke's high debt reduces
flexibility, and the property division is something of an albatross. Despite
the upturn in the UK there are still worries about competition in the DIY
sector. The national lottery ups the ante for the betting division, and
hotels are seeing only patchy demand.
If the company wishes to counter market nerves, there are things it could
do. Sentiment improved towards Forte when Lord Forte's diminishing influence
allowed the dividend to be cut. Ladbroke could follow suit. An accelerated
property disposal programme would cut borrowings faster, while the sale of
Texas Homecare would also bring in cash.
The company may set its face against such moves, arguing that this is not
the stage of the cycle to sell. But the luxury of choice will be lost if
Hilton starts to suffer from the more rapid expansion of its rivals. If
Ladbroke cannot yet face drastic steps then it could at least strengthen its
board and improve disclosure of information to the City. As a FT-SE 100
company yielding over 8.5 per cent, Ladbroke might also consider buying in
its own shares if it is so confident of its story. Instead it has opted for
an enhanced scrip dividend which looks like a mini-rights issue.

FT  04 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Limiting security risk
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Basle-based committee of banking regulators has not been idle since its
capital adequacy rules were published in 1988. The complex standard proposed
last week is based on market risk rather than credit risk and amounts to
another turn of the screw. Banks which trade bonds, equities and currencies
will in future have to hold more capital. If that blows some froth off the
foreign exchange and derivatives markets, so much the better.
But the new rules will have less impact than the earlier Basle guidelines,
which arguably encouraged banks to buy government bonds rather than lend to
companies. Depending on the level of market risk on its books, the proposals
might lift the average international bank's capital requirement one
percentage point from the current 8 per cent of risk-weighted assets. Most
already exceed that target, so liquidity in securities markets where banks
play a leading role should not suffer. There is anyway the separate promise
that banks will be allowed to net off credit exposures to each other. Such a
relaxation of the 1988 rules would free up capital, especially for banks
active in swaps.
Bankers will doubtless still grumble that the regulations do not take into
account the sophisticated hedging strategies they put in place to guard
against market movements. More importantly, the Basle proposals are tougher
in some respects than last year's EC directive on capital adequacy. How
Basle will be reconciled with Brussels, and whether tough-minded regulators
such as the US Securities and Exchange Commission are prepared to relax
their harsher rules, remain open questions. Without harmony among
regulators, capital will simply flow to where regulation is most relaxed.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Keeping up the pressure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are no grounds for euphoria at the endorsement of the
internationally-brokered peace plan for Bosnia by Mr Radovan Karadzic, the
Bosnian Serb leader. The United Nations and European Community mediators, Mr
Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, have sweated to achieve the diplomatic
breakthrough achieved in Athens on Sunday and they deserve to be
congratulated on the outcome. But even their own spokesman acknowledged that
getting the leaders of the warring factions to sign the Vance-Owen plan was
'the easy part'.
It is only as a measure of the difficulties that lie ahead that such a
description can be applied to the many months of laborious negotiations
between the warring parties, and the frantic shuttle diplomacy of the
mediators. A week ago, the process seemed to be in ruins. Now it has been
signed, its implementation promises to be an uncertain and immensely
complicated task.
Even if the Bosnian Serb assembly endorses the peace plan, by no means a
foregone conclusion judging by the statements of some hardliners, it is
still uncertain whether the military will go along with the decision.
General Ratko Mladic, the commander of the Bosnian Serb forces, has proved
in the past that he is capable of taking the law into his own hands.
Bitter pill
The plan is a bitter pill indeed for the hardliners to swallow. It calls for
the withdrawal of Bosnian Serb forces, currently occupying 70 per cent of
the land surface of the country, to areas making up only 43 per cent of the
total. In return, Mr Karadzic appears to have won only two concessions. The
mediators offered to create a narrow demilitarised corridor across northern
Bosnia, which would link Serbia with Serb-controlled territory in Bosnia.
However, it will be not be controlled by local Serb police, as demanded by
Mr Karadzic, but by UN troops. The other modification in favour of the
Bosnian Serbs is reported to be the initial replacement of Serb by UN troops
in regions like eastern Bosnia, now occupied by the Serbs, but which have
been allocated either to the Moslems or Croats under the Vance-Owen plan.
Yet it is clear that this would be a potential source of conflict since both
the Moslems and the Croats would, sooner or later, want to provide their own
security.
For the United Nations and the western allies, in particular, the
enforcement of the peace plan presents an enormous challenge. Nato, which
has offered to assume the task on behalf of an overstretched UN, has
estimated that it will need at least another 60,000 troops for an
unspecified period to do the job properly. Such a large force will require a
substantial contribution from the US, which should be facilitated if
American troops are placed under Nato rather than UN command.
Shot in the arm
Yesterday's announcement by the White House that the US would be prepared to
provide ground forces for such a purpose was a shot in the arm for Nato
planners. But the US contribution is unlikely to meet more than one quarter
of the total number required. Britain and France, with peacekeeping forces
already in Bosnia and other parts of the former Yugoslavia, will also be
asked to make bigger contributions along with other western nations .
They will have to do so quickly, since any delay will certainly ensure the
unravelling of the peace plan, which provides for the withdrawal of all the
warring parties' forces to their designated provinces within 45 days of a
ceasefire. Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Warren Christopher, the
US secretary of state, were also right to emphasise at their weekend meeting
that the pressure on Belgrade and the Bosnian Serbs must be maintained until
a ceasefire is in place and the peace agreement implemented.
The emphasis has shifted away from military action following the outcome of
the Athens summit, though the US still insists that it should be retained as
an option in case the Bosnian Serbs do not stick to the agreement.
What is clear is that international economic sanctions must not be lifted
until the implementation of the peace plan is advanced. The evidence is that
it was the fear of reinforced sanctions and the threat of permanent economic
and political isolation that persuaded President Milosevic to make his vital
contribution to the peace process. Such pressures still have an important
role to play in the enforcement of the plan.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Bulky prices for compact discs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH and other European buyers of compact discs get a raw deal by
comparison with music lovers on the other side of the Atlantic. Prices in
Europe are about 40 per cent higher than in North America. While the precise
size of the discrepancy depends on the exchange rates used for comparison,
even the record industry admits that European consumers pay more.
The issue has come to a head in the UK, where a parliamentary select
committee last week finished public hearings on the subject. So far, the
industry has failed to give a convincing explanation of why CD prices are so
high. It is therefore welcome that Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of
fair trading, is considering referring the matter to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
The source of the price discrepancy is still something of a mystery. The
industry's argument that the costs of supplying CDs in the UK are higher
than in the US does not ring true. On the other hand, no evidence has
emerged of a cartel among either record companies or retailers.
The most convincing explanation is that the industry, which is increasingly
dominated by multinational companies, has segmented the global market into
national ones. In doing so, it has decided that it can get away with
charging more for the same music in Europe than it does in America.
A price-fixing cartel is not necessary to achieve this because one company's
music cannot normally be substituted for another's. Each title is therefore
a mini-monopoly, at least where protected by copyright.
Copyright law
Copyright law also buttresses market segmentation by allowing record
companies to ban retailers from buying CDs at cheaper wholesale prices in
other countries. This ban on parallel imports enables the industry to
maintain wide differentials in wholesale prices between the US and the UK,
which are then reflected in retail prices.
Market segmentation and price discrimination are not in themselves always
against the public interest. Since record companies have a high proportion
of fixed costs, it is impractical for them to price CDs at the marginal cost
of producing them. Doing so would lead to bankruptcy and the industry is
right to stress that profit is not a dirty word.
Recoup costs
To recoup the fixed costs - such as signing on and promoting artists - the
industry has to charge a mark-up on top of marginal costs. Rather than
charging the same mark-up for each customer, it may be more efficient to
charge a higher mark-up for those who receive more value from the product.
This argument provides some justification for the higher prices of CDs
compared with cassettes despite their similar production costs: CDs are
considered to be premium products because they last longer and sound quality
is superior.
But a similar argument cannot justify price discrimination between Europe
and America, unless one argues that Britons and Italians derive more value
from listening to music than Americans and Canadians and so should pay more
to subsidise their transatlantic brethren. Market segmentation in this case
works against consumer interests and the competition authorities should act
to remove it.
The best way of achieving this would probably be to follow the lead set by
the Australian competition authorities which have concluded that the ban on
parallel imports is against the public interest and should be outlawed from
next year. Similar action in Britain would give record companies an
incentive to cut their wholesale prices or face a flood of cheaper imports.
If record companies wished to be imaginative, they might lower their prices
even without such an incentive, as high prices may be stifling the growth of
the market. Given that the average American buys 30 per cent more CDs each
year than the average Briton, the industry might find that lower prices were
compensated through increased sales.

FT  04 MAY 93 / United we stand, divided we fall: Quentin Peel reports on
the malaise in Germany after the latest political resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The trouble with Mr Bjorn Engholm, the dashing and popular leader of
Germany's opposition Social Democrats, is that he never really seemed to
want the power which he was supposed to be seeking.
He was the man who should have been campaigning furiously to overthrow Mr
Helmut Kohl as German chancellor in next year's national elections. His
heart was never in it. Instead he has become the most important victim in a
series of self-inflicted resignations at the heart of the political
establishment.
His sudden and extraordinary decision to quit yesterday for an apparently
trivial mistake in misleading a parliamentary inquiry five years ago
provides graphic confirmation of the malaise affecting the German body
politic in the wake of German unification.
At a moment when the SPD should be far more popular than the ruling
conservative coalition, which is undermined by its own internal squabbles
and an acute downturn in the national economy, the resignation has thrown
the opposition into disarray.
On the one hand, it reflects the struggle for a new identity among social
democrats throughout Europe. More than that, it seems to reflect a pervasive
pessimism, almost a will for self-destruction, in the whole German political
establishment.
The same could be said of the strike launched at midnight on Sunday night by
thousands of steel and engineering workers in east Germany. They are
demanding pay rises which might be expected to force many of their employers
into immediate bankruptcy. The only obvious logic behind the engineering
workers' campaign for a pay rise of more than 20 per cent is that they are
seeking to raise the level at which they can claim unemployment benefit when
their firms close down.
Less than three years after the process of German unification was launched
with heady optimism, the country has slipped into a recessionary gloom which
is in danger of becoming self-fulfilling. And yet the facts, both political
and economic, do not seem to justify the extent of the pessimism.
The last major figure to resign was Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the former
economics minister and candidate for the leader of the Free Democrats, the
junior partner in the ruling coalition. He quit in January after admitting
signing a letter promoting a product - a plastic safety chip for supermarket
trolleys - manufactured by a distant relative.
His successor as economics minister, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, says that the
economy may now be facing its steepest recession since the second world war.
The mood of German industry, as measured by the respected Ifo institute in
Munich, has been in virtual free fall since last year. Industrial orders
were down 15 per cent in the first two months of the year compared with the
same period in 1992, and manufacturing production was down 11 per cent.
Retail sales fell nine per cent, and unemployment, both east and west, has
topped 3m.
The economic gloom has compounded fears that the process of German
unification has brought postwar economic prosperity to an end for good.
The merchants of doom declare that eastern Germany will be eternally
condemned to be an industrial backwater, a German Mezzogiorno, while the
western economy will be dragged down by the burden of interminable cash
transfers to support it.
They fear that the country's structural problems are compounded by a
political vacuum at the top, and the disturbing reappearance of the far
right in local elections. They even question the reliability of Germany as a
bastion of postwar west European democracy. There is gloom at home, and
schadenfreude abroad.
The truth is that the pessimism is as overstated today as the optimism was
in 1990. It is all too simplistic, short-sighted, and ultimately wrong.
German democracy is not in danger, and the German economy is fundamentally
strong, if muscle-bound. But the country is going through a traumatic period
of readjustment. There is a threat that the pervasive gloom could prove
self-fulfilling, by extending and aggravating that process of readjustment.
First, the recession. It is so sharp precisely because of the artificial
boost to the economy which came from unification. Parts of German industry
were working at extraordinarily high levels of capacity utilisation (90 per
cent and more) in the post-unification boom to cope with domestic demand.
The belated effects of the international recession, coinciding with the end
of the first east German spending spree, has seemed unnaturally drastic.
Clearly that is a temporary problem, although one which has caused a slump
in business confidence. The Ifo institute says the pessimism is exaggerated.
'In spite of the extremely precarious situation, one cannot talk of 'the
worst recession since the war', or of an 'economic catastrophe', as some
people are doing,' it said in its March report. Ifo suggests that recovery
could begin even before the end of the year, thanks to a recovery in exports
to the US.
What of the unification process? Most westerners actively involved in the
eastern economy are convinced that the mood is worse than the situation
merits. It is a reflection of the trauma of abandoning a monolithic
socialist society for divisive capitalist competition. East Germany is today
a divided society, primarily defined by who has a job and who is unemployed.
Manufacturing industry is what has been devastated. Against that must be put
the investment being pumped into rebuilding. Mr Kohl summed it up recently.
Between 1990 and 1992 almost DM27bn (Pounds 10.9bn) was spent on rebuilding
the transportation system: 5,600km of roads were renewed, 770 bridges
rebuilt, 2,200km of railway track relayed, and 650km electrified. Anyone who
drives around the so-called 'new federal states' in the east can see both
the results: road works in every town and village, sewers and water mains
being rebuilt.
On top of the transport investment comes Deutsche Telekom. As the largest
single investor in the eastern Lander, it spent DM11bn on capital
investments in the east last year, and will do the same again in 1993: DM5bn
went to east German manufacturers and suppliers.
Then there is the housing programme. The government has doubled - from
DM30bn to DM60bn - the amount that can be borrowed to finance modernisation
of the decrepit east German housing stock. It will, Mr Kohl believes, become
'the locomotive for the upswing in the east'.
Such huge sums of money are having a knock-on effect. Small service
operators - plumbers, electricians, painters and paint-suppliers, small
builders and decorators - are springing up in every small town and village.
Their activities are slow to show up in the statistics, especially when the
statistical base is still suspect. But they are making a visible
contribution.
The great worry about east German industry is that the high wages demanded
to catch up with the west will discourage big investors. Mr Lothar Spath,
former prime minister of Baden-Wurttemberg, the most prosperous state in the
west, and now chief executive of Jenoptik, the laser-electronics arm of what
used to be Carl Zeiss Jena, is convinced the problem is not insuperable.
'It is too late to keep our wages down,' he says. 'So we must become a
high-technology, capital-intensive economy instead.' At Jenoptik, he has
scrapped every product the company makes but one - a laser machine making
semiconductors for the former Soviet military - and is reorienting the
company to identify competitive products for western markets.
The combination of a modernised infrastructure, investment in the most
up-to-date manufacturing plant (such as the Opel factory at Eisenach) and a
workforce which is, by all accounts, more flexible and adaptable than in the
west, suggest that recovery in the east may come more swiftly than expected.
The more intractable challenge may prove to be reforming the western
economy.
Mr Rexrodt may believe the recession is steep. But he is not a pessimist.
Rather, he is convinced that painful structural changes in Germany are now
possible. He is planning to produce a package of measures for reform by the
autumn, to make Standort Deutschland - Germany as an investment location -
attractive once more.
'It is not just a question of wages policy,' he says. 'It is much more. Our
socio-political structures need to be changed.' He spells out a series of
areas for reform:
reduced enterprise taxation;
better promotion of R&amp;D; more flexible labour practices; promotion of
technical education vs academic disciplines;
a reliable energy policy, including nuclear energy;
accelerated privatisation of railways, roads and telecommunications.
Last month, Mr Kohl announced plans for a national conference on the
educational system: 'We are a country where the pensioners get ever younger,
and the students get ever older,' he told the Bundestag. 'We have ever
shorter working lives, ever shorter working weeks, and ever longer holidays:
our competitiveness is in danger.
'A successful industrial nation which hopes to have a future cannot afford
to become little more than a collective amusement park.'
The question is can he, or Mr Rexrodt, deliver? For the Kohl coalition
stands accused of failing to provide leadership, failing to take tough
decisions on economic reform, and falling back on easy compromises.
That is the background against which Mr Engholm has decided to quit. He was,
it must be said, a confirmed pessimist himself: both over the process of
German unification, and over the medium-term prospects for the German
economy. But he has also been a committed player in the game of German
consensus politics, like Mr Kohl himself.
Both leaders showed that they could do business when they succeeded before
Easter in negotiating a 'solidarity pact' to help revive the east German
economy. The deal has been criticised for its failure to reduce government
spending enough in the wealthy west to finance the subsidies to the east:
too much will come from borrowing, and too little from savings.
Yet the importance of the deal was its political message: that both sides of
the political establishment, along with employers and trade unions, and the
powerful German Lander, were prepared to bury their differences in the
interests of national unification. It was a result greeted with obvious
enthusiasm and relief by both Mr Kohl and Mr Engholm.
The SPD leader had also shown a willingness to seek consensus solutions on
other key issues, like the control of the flood of asylum-seekers and
would-be immigrants from eastern Europe, and the use of German soldiers in
international peace-keeping operations.
On those issues, he faced constant criticism from within his own party
ranks. His failure to persuade the party to seek and hold the centre ground
in German politics was almost certainly a reason for his decision to quit.
The question now is whether Mr Engholm's departure from the political scene,
and the disarray it has left behind, will undermine the tentative
cross-party consensus on unification.
Any successor - such as Mr Gerhard Schroder, the current premier of Lower
Saxony - will be tempted to opt for confrontation.
What is certain is that it leaves Chancellor Kohl without a serious
challenger, either in his own party, or in the opposition. It is an ironic
position for a man whose popularity is supposed to be at an all-time low. On
the other hand, it may be a just reward for a man who has steadfastly
refused to be a pessimist in politics.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Chinese answer to George Soros has just been made a university professor
in the hope that some of his Midas touch will rub off on the country's eagre
youth.
'Million Yang', probably China's best-known securities trader, recently
waxed lyrical on the art of stock dealing before an audience at one of the
world's hitherto more obscure seats of learning, Shenyang Finance College.
He is now a 'full-time' professor at the institution.
But it remains to be seen just how much time the smart Shanghainese will
spend up north. Lacking any form of financial training, Yang skipped a
university education and toiled long as a humble worker in Shanghai before
essaying the delights of stocks and shares.
But since the Shanghai bourse opened for business in 1988, Yang has devoted
himself night and day to its every gyration, accumul-ating an enviable pile
in the process.
He is even taking small steps to emulate Soros the benefactor; Yang's meagre
monthly professorial emoluments will go to a good cause, namely a Shenyang
charity called Project Hope.

Senior Bank of England apparatchiks, still sore about having been pipped at
the post for the deputy governorship by a financial journalist, will not
find next month's issue of Vanity Fair exactly calculated to lower the blood
pressure.
In an article entitled The Tweed Jungle, Jacob Weisberg delivers a
blow-by-blow account of 'the bitter power struggle' that erupted in the
'once chummy corridors' of the Economist during the bid to succeed editor
Rupert Pennant-Rea now the latter is off to the 'troubled' Bank.
While not always totally au fait with the byways of the British
establishment, Weisberg, deputy editor of New Republic magazine, manages to
score a direct hit surprisingly often.
But what does the Bank have to say about the way its number two designate
strikes the author, namely as 'rangy, goofy-looking with . . .
pre-fashionable sideburns and a greasy comb-over'?

So why is Wim Duisenberg playing hard to get?
The affable and capable head of the Dutch central bank, who also chairs the
European Community's committee of central bank governors, has to be the
leading candidate for the presidency of the European Monetary Institute.
Favoured by both Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand,
Duisenberg would be charged with trying to steer EMI, which under the
Maastricht treaty is due to spring to life at the beginning of next year,
towards - maybe - a fully-fledged European Central Bank.
Word is that Duisenberg, 57, is not interested - not because he dreads a
political minefield, but because he apparently believes that running the
Dutch bank presents a greater challenge. He may not escape that easily.
Another candidate, Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France and
former managing director of the IMF, turns 64 later this year, and so is a
less likely choice on grounds of age alone.
Meanwhile, Horst Schulmann, a free-thinking German who is a mere 60, is also
mentioned but is reckoned to be quite content in his newish job as head of
the Hesse branch of the Bundesbank.
Could it be that the wily Dutchman might just change his mind if a deal were
reached to site EMI, not in Bonn or Frankfurt, but in Amsterdam?

FT  04 MAY 93 / Observer: Schmidt to do his bit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Helmut Schmidt, the former West German chancellor, has been growing ever
crosser about what he sees as the shortcomings of his successor Helmut Kohl
in steering a unified Germany towards a healthy future.
Not content with doling out schoolmasterly advice in his recent book Handeln
fur Deutschland (Action for Germany), the crusty 74-year-old is putting his
money where his mouth is.
Banking on a bumper first print-run of 200,000 copies, he plans to sink the
ensuing DM1m (Pounds 400,000) profit into a charitable foundation, based in
Weimar.
He is also well on the way to persuading five other likely dignitaries from
the world of business and finance to dig into their pockets to the tune of
DM1m each to help get the foundation going.
The loot will be devoted principally to that great German pastime,
organising talking-shops to dissect the country's ever-complicated future.
One of Schmidt's main worries is that ordinary Germans do not yet feel a
common bond of 'Germanness'. He says he wants people from Dresden to feel at
home in Aachen.
Since he thinks that happy state may be about 40 years off, the Schmidt
foundation should be assured of a healthy life long after its founder passes
on.

FT  04 MAY 93 / From Sinatra to Sinatra-plus: The G7 has established a new
credibility but much has yet to be done
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four months ago it was a joke. It now looks as though we are going to have
to take the Group of Seven seriously again.
After last week's spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund in
Washington, economic policy co-ordination is looking in better fettle than
for many years.
The G7 finance ministers and central bank governors from the US, Japan,
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada not only managed to meet without
squabbling; they put their names to mutually reinforcing measures designed
to return the world economy to faster growth and less unemployment. They
also broadened their present efforts to co-ordinate economic policy to
include long-term issues such as labour market reform and curbing health
care costs.
The day after Thursday's G7 meeting, they gathered with representatives of
the developing and former communist countries in the IMF's policy-making
Interim Committee and turned their commitment to growth into a global
effort. The Interim Committee appointed a referee - the IMF - to blow the
whistle and cry foul if any country's economic and exchange rate policies
threaten to create currency turmoil and upset the international community's
efforts to achieve greater growth.
That was the good news. But past experience tells that there is many a slip
twixt cup and lip in international economic policy co-ordination.
The goal of sustained non-inflationary growth is not new. It was trumpeted
by the G7 and others in the 1980s only to be followed by the near stagnation
of global economic output in 1991 and recession in many industrial countries
including the US, Britain and Canada.
Recession has now spread to Germany and the European continent while Japan
is suffering its most worrying economic slow-down since the second world
war. It does not require a cynic to see how the G7 countries can unite in
their concern to foster growth and job creation.
The one step that could give a boost to global growth prospects - completion
of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks - remains uncertain. The
G7 ministers last week repeated that a further opening of the international
trading system was indispensable for maximising world growth, while
President Bill Clinton pledged 'exceptional efforts' to bring the round to a
close by the end of this year.
But finance ministers can only exhort on trade issues while trade and
agriculture ministers have in the past shown themselves impervious to their
pleas.
The US itself displays a curiously split personality to the outside world.
Hours after Mr Clinton made his pledge on the trade round, his
administration launched a volley of trade sanctions against Japan, Brazil,
India and several other trading partners. This is a peculiar way of
demonstrating liberal intentions.
In the international monetary arena, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury
secretary, has not been averse to treading on his partners' toes. The
courtly Texan let drop his customary mask of benevolence when he talked up
the yen in the weeks ahead of the G7 meeting, much to the annoyance of the
Japanese government. However, he skilfully defused the issue by the time of
the Washington gathering by permitting the US Federal Reserve to intervene
shortly before the meeting to curb the yen's rise.
The G7 is therefore still operating according to the Sinatra Doctrine, by
which its members clearly put their own economic policy priorities first and
'do it my way' in terms of policy making. But Mr Horst Kohler, the state
secretary at the German finance ministry and one of the chief G7 fixers,
insisted last week that there has been a qualitative change in policy
co-ordination. 'It is now Sinatra-plus,' he said.
Certainly the contacts among the G7 countries have intensified since the
Clinton administration took office. Last week's meeting was the third in as
many months at ministerial level. The senior finance ministry officials who
do so much of the work preparing the meetings now have a telephone
conference line arranged to improve communications.
Among the ministers, there seems to be a genuine spirit of goodwill. Mr
Bentsen can claim much of the credit for this since first calling for a
strengthening of the G7 co-ordination process in January.
Under the Bush administration, America's partners learned to construe
Washington's occasional urge to co-ordinate policies as an attempt to secure
US policy goals with other peoples' money and effort. Mr Bentsen has avoided
giving this impression, stressing the benefits of joint action. He has been
careful to avoid megaphone diplomacy.
Looking back over the past three months, there is much that the group can be
pleased about. Economic policies in the big industrial countries are in
better balance since the US took steps to reduce its budget deficit; Japan
announced a fiscal package to boost its economy and the Bundesbank embarked
on a programme of cautious but relatively frequent interest rate reductions.
The G7 also has completed arrangements to set up a nuclear safety fund to
deal with the dangers caused by Chernobyl-style nuclear reactors in the
former Soviet Union. In mid-April the group agreed a package of aid measures
for Russia which may have strengthened the hand of President Boris Yeltsin
ahead of his referendum victory.
Inevitably, more needs to be done. Because of their powerful position in the
world, the G7 countries carry the overwhelming responsibility for bringing
the Uruguay Round trade negotiations to a successful conclusion. Further
efforts will be required in the years and months ahead to cut the US budget
deficit, stimulate growth in Japan and reduce interest rates in Europe.
But it is difficult not to agree with Mr Bentsen's verdict on events since
he set out to revitalise the G7. 'Not bad for the first 100 days,' he said.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Good soldier's bitter end: David Buchan looks at the lasting
consequences on French politics of Pierre Beregovoy's death
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France, or at least the entire French political world, is still in shock
after Pierre Beregovoy's suicide on Saturday. The self-administered death of
the former prime minister, little less than a month after leaving office,
has put a temporary freeze on all political activity and on the announcement
this week of a new government programme.
The wider inquest on the death of Mr Beregovoy, who will be buried today in
the central French town of Nevers, has already begun. The immediate reaction
of many politicians has been to take the tragedy out on the press.
Few were as extreme as Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister, who
yesterday implicitly accused 'certain media' of the 'murder' of the former
prime minister by allegedly hounding him over an interest-free property loan
which Mr Beregovoy received from a dubious business acquaintance.
Other, more thoughtful politicians acknowledged that Mr Beregovoy's death
could have as lasting consequences a reinforcement of the already-emollient
political style of Mr Edouard Balladur, who succeeded Mr Beregovoy at the
Hotel Matignon, the prime minister's residence, and an accelerated drive
within Mr Beregovoy's faction-torn socialist party to close ranks and to
rebuild itself.
There is also the unknowable effect of the tragedy on President Francois
Mitterrand's desire to stay out his two remaining years in the Elysee, after
the loss of someone who was among his most loyal - yet, by some accounts,
most abused - lieutenants.
It is impossible to be precise about the consequences of a tragedy because
no one knows what exactly led to it. Mr Beregovoy left, as far as is known,
no suicide note.
The dramatic headlines all came yesterday - France has few Sunday newspapers
to do justice to something that happens on a Saturday, the day Mr Beregovoy
shot himself with his bodyguard's revolver.
But none was as expressive as Le Figaro's cartoon, showing the former prime
minister ascending to heaven with the French republic's symbolic figure of
Marianne simply asking 'Pourquoi?'.
By choosing to take his life on May 1, Mr Beregovoy seemed to want to leave
a message. For this metalworker-turned-prime minister, the date had great
symbolism, not only politically but also personally. As he recounted several
times, it was on May 1 that at the age of 17 he got his first job on the
railways in 1942, that on demobilisation from the army in 1946 he became a
salesman for Gaz de France, the state utility, and that years later, in 1981
he became President Mitterrand's first chief of staff at the Elysee. But
what the precise message was may forever remain obscure.
Some fellow Socialists, including his brother Michel, were quick to say the
last straw for Mr Beregovoy was the revelations in February this year that
he had borrowed FFr1m (Pounds 120,000) interest-free from the late
Roger-Patrice Pelat to help buy a small apartment in Paris's smart 16th
arrondissement after the Socialist defeat in 1986 interrupted his stint as
finance minister.
Certainly, he had weathered other scandals that had broken around him, such
as the case of alleged insider trading concerning Pechiney's purchase of
Triangle in 1988 and involving Mr Pelat again and Mr Beregovoy's own chef de
cabinet when Mr Beregovoy returned to the finance ministry in that year.
The Pelat loan affair, breaking less than a month before the March
parliamentary elections, must have been particularly galling for Mr
Beregovoy, who had always vaunted his honesty and who made stamping out
corruption a particular theme of the premiership that he assumed in April
1992.
But Mr Beregovoy's explanation of the loan, and in particular his repayment
of it by the end of 1992, were accepted with little demur, and neither the
press nor his political opponents made much of it during the campaign. It
was hardly the vendetta that Mr Leotard, who has had his own real estate
dealings subjected to judicial inquiry, seemed to suggest yesterday.
Was the rhetoric of the victorious right responsible for making the former
premier crack? Certainly, leaders of the new centre-right government did not
spare Mr Beregovoy and his colleagues in their condemnation of the
Socialists' management of the economy. Even Mr Balladur got carried away a
bit on the campaign trail, in claiming that the Socialists were leaving the
economy 'in its worst state since the second world war'.
Certainly, France's public finances, especially its social security
deficits, are in a mess, and Mr Beregovoy was said to have been nervous
about the 'audit' of state finances, which was to have been published
yesterday, but which Mr Balladur has now delayed. But such 'audits' are not
unusual measures for an incoming administration to take. The Socialists did
the same when they first took power in 1981. It is a standard political
means by which a new government paves the way for unpopular measures such as
the tax increases that Mr Balladur plans.
The bitter pill of parliamentary defeat might have been sugared for Mr
Beregovoy, had Mr Balladur publicly acknowledged the good part of his
inheritance from his predecessor - the strength of France's money and its
trade balance. For Mr Beregovoy rightly prided himself on his sound
management of France's external economic position.
Again, it must have been galling for the Socialist former prime minister to
see French interest rates falling - partly on the markets' confidence in so
strong a new conservative government, but also partly because of the
fortuitous decline in German rates - so soon after his departure from the
Matignon and before the new government had the time to put any new policies
into action.
If the Balladur government were rabidly reactionary, one could speculate
that Mr Beregovoy's tragic demise might have a moderating effect on it. But
it is not, and there are probably enough centrists to prevent it taking such
a course in the future.
Aside from removing one of its few working-class leaders, the long-term
effect of Mr Beregovoy's death on his own party may be to bring its warring
ranks together. The former prime minister had tried to stay on good terms
with both Mr Laurent Fabius, the Mitterrandist party boss, and with Mr
Michel Rocard, the party's presidential contender in 1995, who recently
toppled him.
Mr Beregovoy's role as the unfortunate captain who went down with his
governmental ship in March was not really a bone of contention in the
Fabius-Rocard row. His role was strongly criticised by the left-wing Mr
Jean-Pierre Chevenement, but the latter has since left the party.
Yet, probably the bitterest thing which Mr Beregovoy had to swallow in his
long career was that President Mitterrand left it until the party was
crumbling into internecine warfare and the economy sliding into recession to
name him to the top government job.
On entering the Matignon, he is said to have commented bitterly of his
predecessors: 'The president chose Fabius because he was the youngest,
Rocard because he was the most brilliant, Cresson because she was a woman.
Finally, he named me, when it was already too late.'
None the less, the good soldier plugged on, apparently believing that some
miracle might turn up. He even bravely deluded himself that he could do
something about rising unemployment, an issue which mattered greatly to this
former union organiser. But no miracle ever materialised.

Sir, While Edward Mortimer is correct to stress the late Mr Turgut Ozal's
international achievements ('Friend when in need', April 28), Mr Ozal's
domestic rehabilitation is equally important. Under Mr Ozal, Turkey became a
country worth dealing with and investing in. He pushed Turkey away from
nationalism and authoritarianism. If western leaders want Turkey to continue
becoming more tolerant of diversity and more concerned with the creation of
wealth, they should have paid Mr Ozal the tribute he deserved by attending
his funeral.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Letter: Effective learning and accuracy in school tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor PAUL BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In his article on 'Hidden flaws in school testing' (April 29), Lord
Skidelsky argues that we should separate the two functions of assessment and
testing. His vision is that externally set tests should be used to pass
judgments on teachers' performance, while assessments designed to support
learning should be left to schools. A national assessment system
'simplified' in this way promises to reduce the burden of testing on
schools.
There are several reasons why the Task Group on Assessment and Testing did
not recommend such a system in its 1988 report. Short external tests are
likely to give unreliable results, placing a substantial proportion of
pupils in the wrong grades or levels. The School Examinations and Assessment
Council does not have a research programme to determine the possible error
in the current national tests. In view of research evidence about error in
such tests, this is unacceptable - the public needs to have such evidence.
National assessment results are not only used to judge teachers, they give
important evidence about every individual pupil; errors mean both that
injustice is done and that inaccurate guidance is given about learning
needs.
A further reason is that short and apparently simple tests cannot measure
important outcomes of learning, yet they have a strong influence on
teaching. Given that test results are to be used to judge them, teachers are
bound to direct their teaching to maximise test scores. This usually reduces
to drilling pupils to produce short answers to sets of questions, each of
which tests small fragments of knowledge devoid of any purposeful context.
The evidence about pupils' learning is that such an approach is harmful.
A recent survey of science teachers on the effects of testing at age 14 in
1992 revealed that most believe that those tests have had the narrowing and
negative effects on their teaching that could have been predicted. However,
it should not be necessary to research the damage in our own schools to test
the argument. Most of the state testing systems in the US have been using,
for many years, the type of approach that Lord Skidelsky is recommending.
Most of them are now abandoning this 'economical' testing and engaging in
programmes to develop 'authentic' forms of assessment which will involve
classroom assessments by teachers in close relationship to formative
assessment.
The reason for their considerable investment in such changes is quite
simple. Their experience of the short external tests has been that they give
poor policy information and inaccurate evidence about individual teachers
and pupils, while at the same time they exert pressures which damage good
learning practices.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Letter: Charging for US calls at BT and Mercury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TERRY RHODES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The complexities of price comparisons between the US and UK and between
BT and Mercury are such that even your reporter has been misled.
The article 'Competition on the line' (April 29) actually compared Mercury's
best 'peak' price to the US (8am to 8pm) with BT's 'off-peak' price.
The correct comparison for a three-minute call to the US, taking the best
business price for each company in 'peak' time is 122.15p from Mercury and
123.55p from BT. While Mercury charges for the exact call length, to the
nearest 100th of a second, BT still charges by the unit. This means that the
BT customer has to pay for the unused time left over. Taking this into
account statistically, Mercury's best business price saves customers an
average of 8 per cent in the 'peak' period.
The leading independent expert's comparison (Octagon Telecomms Tariffs 1993)
concludes 'if a customer does have access to the directly connected Mercury
2100 service, there are no grounds from a pricing point of view for using BT
for any outgoing calls'.
In terms of benefit to UK business, it is now cheaper to call the US, or
anywhere in Europe, using Mercury than in the reverse direction.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Letter: Cadbury not looking to boost earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ANNE SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You report that research shows the latest innovations in corporate
governance have had little effect in improving the performance of British
business ('Governance changes not productive', April 22.). Sadly, it seems
there is no correlation between earnings per share and the number of
non-executives on British boards. Would that we could find a simple ratio
and all would be well.
The research is rather misplaced, however. The purpose of good corporate
governance is to ensure the accountability of directors to their
shareholders, who by turn have responsibilities as the owners of large
sectors of the economy in which employees and wider society have an
interest.
The Cadbury Committee was not looking to boost earnings per share, but to
re-establish confidence in a governance process that was open to abuse. It
sets out advice to ensure that power is not concentrated, that checks and
balances exist within board structures, that proper procedures for financial
reporting are established. Each should contribute to high standards of
administration in public companies and meet the goal of accountability
expected by shareholders. Perhaps corporate governance standards should be
regarded as an intangible asset, rather than a short-term drive towards cash
earning.
Our research shows that half of FT-SE 100 companies still withhold key
executives from retirement by rotation and only in rare exceptions are
shareholder proxy votes reported.
It is still hard going on corporate governance issues in the UK. Cadbury
should not be set up as a straw man for a separate set of problems in
business - its fascination with short-term financial results - when the key
challenges facing business are long term.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Arts: Never had it so good - Sculpture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sculptors may complain of the practical difficulties they face, and the lack
of opportunities to show their work, but then sculptors in general do
complain. Break through to any kind of critical or curatorial notice and the
world, it seems, is theirs. The Henry Moore Institute, which was set up in
Leeds 10 years ago for the study and encouragement of sculpture, as we saw
last week, flourishes mightily. The Yorkshire Sculpture Park, now well into
its second decade at Bretton Hall near Wakefield, has become one of the
prime public attractions in the whole of the north of England.
There is sculpture now in Grize-dale Forest, where sculptors from all over
the world go to work on site, and in the Forest of Dean. From next month,
some 60 sculptors, at the invitation of the Royal Society of British
Sculptors and P&amp;O, the shipping company, are to show their work at Chelsea
Harbour in the largest-ever such show in London in the open air. Sculpture
commissions and competitions proliferate. Every new development or office
block, every refurbished city square, must have its proper monumental and
celebratory piece. Birmingham's Victoria Square now has its Anthony Gormley
and its Dhruva Mistry to set beside Her Majesty; the London Dockland's
Development Board has its Nigel Hall, Michael Kenny and Zadok Ben-David each
adorning one portico of the new Limehouse Link.
All this is as it should be, but it has a more regrettable side. The
received wisdom is that it is sculpture the world wants to see - a
self-fulfilling limitation at best. So it is that sculpture has come to
dominate such treats as the Turner Prize, the New Contemporaries and the
Barclay's Young Artist Award. Sculpture it was that supplied the Hayward's
latest comprehensive survey of recent art. When did the British Council last
give the British Pavilion at the Venice Biennale to a young painter? Only 21
years ago? Surely not. Could it be that sculptors will form the British
contingent to the Aperto, that is always dedicated to younger artists, at
this year's Biennale? Don't ask.
But it is the work that counts, and our galleries, squares and gardens are
full of it. David Nash is a wood man, working, as the title to his current
show tells us, At the edge of the forest. He burns, scrapes, chops and saws
his way into the living wood, improvising and responding to the particular
chance of form and context. He does only what is necessary to realise the
particular image he has decided upon in general terms, which is not to say
that he does not work with extreme technical refinement and sophistication.
Rough-hewn and unpolished his surfaces may be, but exquisitely so.
These tall, simple, ambiguous modern totems confirm rather the more
monumental than the wry and playful qualities of his work, with the forms
often simplified by the optical density of the carbonised surfaces. The
exception is the floor piece that consists of lumps of charred oak
interspersed with somewhat clumpier carved lumps of alder, set out as it
were in a fairy ring. Materially seductive though it is, its essentially
arbitrary and precious aestheticism soon takes over. He is a better artist
than that.
Anish Kapoor, our hero at Venice in 1990 and last year's Turner laureate, is
another carver and splitter and opener-up of secret cavities, though of
stone. His new work continues his preoccupation with the cavity, so deep,
secret, unfathomable, impenetrable, the interior space invested with blue or
magenta pigment so dense as to seem all but solid. But now he pierces the
cavity at its furthest side, a little to relieve the secret perhaps, if not
release it. Or, having smoothed a facet of his rough block of stone, he then
carves within the cavity a swelling, amorphous form. Here, he seems to say,
is the eternal egg, or the omphalos of the Sybil, that might reveal the
secret of the universe. For Kapoor's work is nothing if not fraught with
symbol and ambiguous possibility, pervasively sensual, inescapably sexual.
Paul Neagu's symbolism is more recondite and idiosyncratic, founded in
personal metaphysics and cosmology. His eight Catalytic stations, set out in
a ring beside the Economist Building in London's West End, are for him, like
the stations of the Cross, individual points of contemplation and
realisation, yet part of a coherent whole. Together they represent the full
range of the formal imagery he has developed over the years - the broken
star, the rectangle held aloft, the splayed, extended feet of the tripod.
The artist's own interpretation and intention are, of course, for us to take
or leave as may be. What remain are objects beautifully made, sculpturally
complex yet resolved with a wonderfully ingenious and satisfying simplicity.
Each summer, the New Art Centre's sculpture garden at Roche Court in
Wiltshire allows young and comparatively unknown sculptors to show alongside
their established peers - to say nothing of Moore, Hepworth, Gill, Frink -
and in a most beautiful setting. Notable in this year's large selection are
Anthony Gormley, whose sentinel-figure stands alone in the bluebell wood
above the garden, Katherine Gigli, Mark Dunhill, Kim Lim, Phillip King,
Barry Flanagan, Peter Randall-Page, Peter Logan, whose metal rods swing in
the wind, Bryan Kneale, Sven Bayer with his large garden pots, and Sarah
More, with some fine carved lettering.

How odd that Michael Buerk, whom I associate with really worthwhile
reporting, has got himself enmeshed in 999 (9.40 BBC1). This is tabloid TV,
tales of heroism and bravery re-enacted. Perhaps the powers that be see this
as the way forward, the low-brow and down-market made more palatable by
hauling in respected faces.
Forty Minutes (9.50, BBC2) visits an army training camp in Australia where
women volunteers learn not to sleep with their teddy-bears if they want to
join 31 Platoon. Conceivably this is the first such programme to explore how
Army training rescues a bunch of women from the decadence of civvy street
and transforms them into disciplined, motivated, worthwhile human beings.
Maiden Voyages (8.30 C4) is also about a woman rediscovering herself in
Australia. A single-parent mum who brought up children in her teens on a
Manchester council estate, flies to Australia and hires a motorbike. She
rides across the outback and feels free and generally uplifted. Meanwhile on
BBC2, Delia Smith finds fulfilment of a more traditional kind.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Arts: The old order changes - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Studio at the Royal National Theatre is less well known than it ought to
be to the general public. Physically, it exists in a lot of space at the Old
Vic, provided rent-free by the Old Vic owner, Ed Mirvish. The funding for
its work is largely (and slightly mysteriously) private: the names of its
benefactors have not been published. Its purpose is research and development
and the encouragement of new talent, not just for the RNT but for British
theatre as a whole. Most of its works are shown only to invited audiences.
There is now an opportunity to see more widely what the Studio is up to.
Last Saturday three new plays, developed at the Studio, were shown at the
Cottesloe. More are to come and the Springboards season, as it is called,
will be extended around the country.
This was the second time in two weeks that I spent almost an entire day in a
theatre, the previous occasion being Bill Morrison's trilogy, A Love Song
for Ulster, at the Tricycle. It is an exhausting, but ultimately rewarding
and mind-changing experience. Seen on separate days, the three plays at the
Cottesloe might look thin, with the quality of the acting and the direction
far outstripping that of the writing. Seen on the same day, the writing
looks much less random. There is almost a common theme, which is that there
is not much to laugh about, or even to hope for, in contemporary Britain.
All three plays show societies breaking down, though each has at least one
character either striving for something better or trying to preserve the
best of the old.
Hove is a collaborative work without a single author by the Talking Tongues
Company. It is set in a boarding house in that amorphous area somewhere
between where Brighton ends and Hove begins. One of the guests, a specialist
in sea studies played by Alan David, has been there for 25 years: he still
prefers to talk to the sea rather than to the other inhabitants. The
landlady, majestically performed by Lindy Alexander, plainly thinks her
place is a cut above the rest: special cooking, special rules.
That is not how others see it. A married local councillor has been keeping
his girlfriend there for some time, both preserving the fiction that he is
more important than he is. The arrival of Clare (Rachel Joyce), who may be
an artist but has a touch of the property developer about her, disturbs any
calm the place may claim. The words 'dead house' are painted on a wall. The
landlady's son covers himself with petrol, then departs with a box of
matches. In short, the old house, the old order, is falling down.
Hove is not a finished play: too much is left unexplained - the apparent
suicide, for example. But played as it is at the Cottesloe, and directed by
David Farr, it is certainly haunting.
The Neighbour, by Meredith Oakes, is set outside one of those tower-block
council estates that one thought were no longer being built. It also seems
slightly odd in the 1990s that the inhabitants are all white. The characters
live in fear and mutual suspicion. Only one of them - John, played by Ben
Chaplin - has much in the way of aspirations: he wants to repair old
furniture. His mother throws it out; another boy sets fire to it, as being
fit only for yuppies and not even worth nicking. John tells the police and
the community closes in on him for grassing. He dies, having drunk a bottle
of vodka as a dare to prove himself to his contemporaries. Alcohol plays a
strong role in all three plays.
I found The Neighbour needlessly brutal. Yet set against Judith Johnson's
Somewhere, which is the best of the bunch, it falls into context. Here are
people without much money, without decent jobs and without much hope. They
are not down-and-outers: somehow the social security must provide, but
ambition is almost unthought of.
In Somewhere, set initially round Merseyside, the best hope for the girls is
to go to Manchester to work as escorts for tired businessmen. Later they
move to Amsterdam where being on the game is open. For one of the boys the
only hope is the army. What I admire most about the play is that, despite
all of that, Ms Johnson has written a love story. That is a bold thing to do
in such a setting in 1993. Dawn, the long-time prostitute, is ultimately
reunited with her soldier lover. In a way, society has held together. Dawn
is magnificently played by Katrina Levon and the direction by Polly Teale is
faultless.
In repertory, Cottesloe Theatre until May 15

attracted a lot of attention this year. Morris dancers set up their maypoles
outside the Houses of Parliament - but, unknown to them, the finest May Day
celebration was being held in South Kensington.
On Saturday, at 10.30am, the Berlin Philharmonic gave its annual Europa
concert at the Royal Albert Hall. As it seemed impossible to buy a
programme, I am unable to give any details as to what the Europa concert
entails. If, however, it means an event of this quality every May 1, well
attended, put on at prices the average music-lover can afford, May Day
should be declared a public holiday in perpetuity forthwith.
It is still a novelty for audiences in Britain to encounter this orchestra
under a conductor other than Herbert von Karajan. (During Karajan's long
reign the orchestra's visits here were in any case relatively infrequent;
Paris was favoured and always seemed to get the more interesting
programmes.)
There has been much discussion as to what has happened to the orchestra's
playing in the post-Karajan era. Is its distinctively rich and burnished
quality still in place? Has it become a more standard international
orchestra? Obviously Bernard Haitink will have imposed his own requirements
on the players, but the immaculate, warm blend of the sound all the way
through Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet Fantasy Overture was the pure Berlin
Philharmonic original, simply matured over the years.
It was a lean programme - one and a half hours of music, straight through,
no interval. After the Tchaikovsky, the orchestra slimmed its ranks and
lightened its touch to accompany Frank Peter Zimmermann in Mozart's G major
violin concerto, an exquisitely poised slow movement spoiled only by what
sounded like newly-installed air conditioning, humming away inconveniently
on a G sharp throughout.
Then, finally, as immaculately-played a performance of Stravinsky's Rite of
Spring as one could hope to hear. Every page of the score gave evidence of
having been phrased, balanced, listened to with a fresh ear. I shall mention
only one instance: the subtle blending of exposed octaves through the
orchestra at the beginning of part two, which evoked so powerfully the
haunting wail of mystic rites, perhaps half-glimpsed in the distance.
Haitink, who has conducted this score as a staged ballet, paces it
unerringly. The final dance of each section was thrilling.
* It was fortunate for the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra that its London
concert fell the evening before, not the evening after. The American
orchestra is on a European tour with Raymond Leppard, in his fifth year as
music director, and it would seem a very worthwhile visitor, if such
comparisons had not been to hand.
This is a new-world orchestra, with sound proficiency and determination to
match. Even without the contrast of the Berlin Philharmonic, the orchestral
sound would have an industrial-belt hardness and vigour. The brass
predominate, not swamping the other sections, but prominent enough to give a
strong metallic core. Strings wanted subtlety of colour; they did not
provide balm when it was required.
For all its good features, the orchestra's playing was not quite expressive
in either Bruch's first violin concerto or Elgar's Enigma Variations.
Rhythms were marked with a degree too much force; phrases were shaped
dogmatically, as though the music was not being felt from within. The
soloist in the Bruch was Dmitry Sitkovetsky, whose almost glaringly bright
and authoritative playing was equally impressive, rather than moving.
To start, the orchestra had given us its American calling-card, William
Schuman's New England Triptych. This is a brief concerto for orchestra,
which gives each section the opportunity to shine. With their technical
dexterity the Indianapolis players did so. A strong American contingent in
the audience at the Barbican did not let their virtues go unrecognised.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Arts: La Gioconda - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the current, outstandingly successful season at Opera North, the mixture
of rare and repertory operas seems to have been calculated with greater
boldness than ever. With the new staging of La Gioconda, an opera not given
in any mainstream British house for more than 60 years, the company and its
departing general administrator, Nicholas Payne, demonstrate once more the
tonic wholeness of their artistic vision.
They understand that the blood-and-guts enjoyment afforded by Ponchielli's
1876 potboiler is not to be despised, since it can provide  - when delivered
with all the zest and enthusiasm of Saturday's performers - a strong,
savoury complement to the more substantial experiences supplied by this
season's Gerhard, Mozart, Verdi, Britten and (still to come) Berg.
This opera is often clamoured for by audiences hungry for elemental operatic
thrills, seldom tackled outside Italy and beyond the New York Met. Both
clamour and opera-house reluctance are easily understood. The demands
Gioconda makes are Grand-Operatic in the Meyerbeer sense - six front-rank
voices cased in house-filling personalities, not to mention substantial
choral and dance troupes and scenic effects, all fully employed through four
long acts. Yet the elevated music-drama already worked up by Verdi (in Don
Carlos and Aida) out of similar Meyerbeerian forces and theatrical
propositions remains obstinately out of Ponchielli's reach.
It is no less easy to be dismissive about this opera. In a memorably snooty
sentence Shaw regretted 'the mischief which great men' - he meant here Verdi
 -'bring upon the world when small men begin to worship them'. Boito's
adaptation of the Victor Hugo play Angelo, Tyran de Padoue bursts with the
overblown language that he would use again in Otello and Falstaff, but
desperately lacks the taut, coherent scene and character-planning of those
two Verdi masterpieces; with the benefit of hindsight one can recognise in
the operatic Iago a 'fulfilled' version of Barnaba, the spy whose tiresome
one-note villainy moves the Gioconda plot on each of its jerky stages.
Yet in a small theatre, with a cast brilliantly chosen for the particular
revival context, with an elegantly designed production (by Philip Prowse),
charged to distil suggestive Venetian atmosphere and fantasy from lamps,
swags of cloth and coloured streamers, and with a conductor (Oliver von
Dohnanyi) refreshingly responsive to the needs of singers, orchestra, chorus
and production team all at one go - in these circumstances, the tremendous
vitality of La Gioconda became harder to gainsay with each passing moment.
Opera North's is not an 'ideal' revival: ca va sans dire. Cuts dictated by
budgetary constraint remove 'The Dance of the Hours' and splice together,
ingeniously and naughtily, the first two acts. Prowse's Victorian-era
updating adds its own special appeal but also, in Act 1, an additional
element of confusion. On Saturday the veteran Australian Clifford Grant,
back in Britain after an absence of nearly two decades, sounded below form
as Alvise, though still in command of a sizeable bass voice. Keith Latham,
Barnaba, is a capable baritone short on tonal 'spice' and uncomfortable in
Italian (altogether, an English translation is badly missed).
But the others went through their scenes and routines with excellent vigour,
making one admire the individual stamp of the applause-wooing melodies
Ponchielli shared out between them. Catherine Wyn-Rogers, a quietly glowing
Cieca, and Sally Burgess, a lustrous, glamorous Laura, both wanted only the
final degree of punch at the top - Miss Burgess's marvellously succulent
shaping of words and notes was continual compensation.
Edmund Barham's tirelessly ringing Enzo discovered much, not all, of the
romance in his phrases. And Rosalind Plowright, having weathered a period of
vocal troubles to emerge with dramatic soprano newly malleable and
colourful, brought to the title role a handsome measure of the required
sumptuousness. Operatic pleasure comes in many kinds; on Saturday, the
response of the Opera North audience left no doubt that full-blooded Italian
opera offers some of the most simply gratifying of all.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Construction Contracts: Tarmac to promote pioneering scheme
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TARMAC intends to train unemployed people in building skills while
constructing a training advice centre at Middlesbrough. The centre is
designed expressly to teach new trades to people who are out of work.
The commitment to take people from the dole queue and to retrain them to
work in the building industry is a condition of the Pounds 3.5m contract
awarded to Tarmac Construction.
The build-and-train scheme has been agreed between Tarmac and a consortium
of the Department of Employment's Job Match, Middlesbrough City Challenge
and Middlesbrough Borough Council using 'inner city' regeneration funds from
the Government and Enterprise Commission.
The year-long building programme, taking up to 30 trainees, starts this
month.
The training advice development centre at Berwick Hills, Middlesbrough, will
be built for TAD, a company which has been formed by the Borough Council and
Middlesbrough Training Economic Council.
People without jobs and who live within the regeneration area of the city,
which covers a five mile radius, will be selected by Job Match, and trained
in such skills as bricklaying, plumbing, painting, electrical installation,
and clerical administration as the centre is built.
Under the scheme, which has the character of a pilot scheme, trainees will
be paid out of public funds.
The expectation is that course members will be trained up to national
vocation qualification part two standard. The hope is that after the scheme
they will be fully qualified to work on other construction projects.
The three-storey centre will boast training and advisory facilities, as well
as a restaurant, creche, conference hall and administrative offices at
ground level.
Hotel-style en suite rooms will provide residential accommodation on the
upper two floors.

FT  04 MAY 93 / People: Ford jumps ship from P&amp;O
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of Lord Sterling's key lieutenants has decided to jump ship. Peter Ford,
54, who joined Jeffrey Sterling's Sterling Guarantee Trust in 1970, has
resigned as an executive director of The Peninsular and Oriental Steam
Navigation Company.
Ford is one of a small group of senior executives who followed Sterling
around as he expanded out of the property business and took control of P&amp;O.
Ford, who has a Harvard MBA and has worked for McKinsey &amp; Co, was appointed
to the P&amp;O board in February 1985 following its merger with Sterling
Guarantee Trust.
During his time with Sterling he came to prominence as the chairman of P&amp;O
European Ferries during the strike. But he has done several other jobs
including looking after the group's shopping and exhibition centres.
Most recently, Ford has been in charge of P&amp;O's industrial services
businesses, a large part of which were sold to Granada last month. Rather
than move to another part of the P&amp;O empire, Ford has decided that he would
like to pursue his own interests outside the group. He is a past chairman of
the Sheffield Business School.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
McDEVITT STREET BOVIS INC, one of the Bovis Construction Group's three US
subsidiaries, is building a particular reputation in the healthcare sector.
Its latest success is a USDollars 30m (Pounds 19.3m) contract for a 235,000
sq ft, eight-storey medical office building with an adjacent 1,500 space car
parking deck in its home town of Charlotte, North Carolina.
The client is Presbyterian Hospital on behalf of the Nalle Clinic, a local
group of 85 multi-disciplined doctors. Preconstruction work is already under
way with the 14-month building programme due to begin next year.
Adding the Nalle Clinic to its list of on-going healthcare contracts gives
MSB four projects for Presbyterian totalling some USDollars 70m (Pounds
45m).
The company's penetration of the healthcare market has been increased by
winning a medical office park in West Volusia, near Orlando in Florida, and
a contract for additions and renovations to Titus County Memorial Hospital
in Mount Pleasant, Texas.
In Cheverly, Maryland, MSB has won a contract to build an ambulatory
services pavilion for Prince George's County Hospital. The 56,240 sq ft
building will house surgical suites with outpatient, intensive care and
research facilities.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Jumping the EC fences -
Charles Batchelor continues a monthly series answering questions raised by
the single market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Growing Business page's Single Market Q&amp;A series is intended to allow
readers to raise issues prompted by the formal launch of the single European
market on January 1 1993.
If economic recovery in the UK continues British companies should once again
be able to turn their thoughts to expansion and opportunities in continental
Europe. To judge by the response to the first Q&amp;A feature (on March 9) there
is also a keen interest among readers outside the community.
Illegal barriers to EC trade
Q: I have encountered what I believe to be non-tariff barriers in selling to
Italy. Is there an organisation that can assist companies who experience
these problems in trading with another member state?
A: In the UK the Single Market Compliance Unit (SMCU), at the Department of
Trade and Industry, advises and assists UK companies experiencing illegal
barriers to trade in other member states of the community.
These may be breaches of the Treaty of Rome or non-compliance with single
market measures by other member states. This is of particular value to
smaller companies with limited resources.
Where a company, individual or organisation meets a problem, believes it has
a legal basis for complaint and has evidence to support it, the SMCU will
review the case and advise on the best way to resolve it.
Assuming a legal basis for complaint is found, the UK government will
usually take up the case with the member state concerned. However, it can
take many months to resolve problems and patience will be necessary.
A company may also wish to raise the matter with the European Commission,
particularly if a direct approach to the country concerned is not working.
The SMCU can advise companies preparing a case for the commission. The
commission will carry out its own investigation and if it finds evidence of
a breach of EC law it may issue infringement proceedings against the member
state concerned. This may result in the case being brought before the
European Court of Justice.
Public contract procedures
Q: I would like more information on the procedures for public contracts
mentioned in last month's Q&amp;A article. Is the negotiated procedure, whereby
contracting authorities only consult contractors of their choice, not
anti-competitive?
A: There are three procedures in use: open, restricted and negotiated.
If an open procedure is used by the contracting authority anyone may tender.
The open procedure may be used for the purchase of works, supplies and
services.
Under the restricted procedure anyone may apply to be considered. The
purchaser selects suitable suppliers from those who have expressed an
interest in a contract advertised in the Supplement to the Official Journal
and invites them to tender. Under the negotiated procedure, direct
discussions take place between the contracting authority and one or more
suppliers or contractors of its choice. This procedure is not intended to be
anti-competitive but to be practical and to shorten lengthy procedures.
The negotiated procedure, with no prior publication in the Supplement to the
Official Journal, may be used when:
no tenders are received under an open or restricted procedure;
there are technical or artistic reasons for choosing a particular supplier
or a particular supplier has exclusive rights to the product or service
needed;
there is extreme urgency resulting from unforeseeable events.
Where supplies of a product are concerned the negotiated procedure may be
used when:
goods are for research and development purposes only;
additional deliveries are sought from a particular supplier because of the
need for compatibility with existing goods or for technical reasons.
Where public works are concerned the negotiated procedure may be used when:
additional works cannot be separated from a main contract or are strictly
necessary to its later stages;
under certain specified circumstances, where a previous works contract is
repeated.
In addition, the negotiated procedure, with prior publication in the
Supplement to the Official Journal, may be used for works contracts where:
tenders under an open or restricted procedure were irregular or
unacceptable;
the nature of the work makes it difficult to calculate the overall price at
the outset.
Opening outlets in Germany
Q: I am a supplier of hairdressing products and equipment and am looking to
open an outlet in Germany. How do I go about this?
A: If Germany is a new market for your company we suggest that you select a
region where you would like to start and then consult the local chamber of
commerce for information about appropriate local distributors. In Germany
hairdressing supplies and equipment are normally sold to chemists and
hairdressing salons served by regional wholesale distributors.
It is often a good idea to invite the distributor to inspect your offices
and products and then ask him to prepare a report on the market potential,
regulations and the competition in his area. This can lead to a distribution
agreement (where the distributor becomes the sole purchaser of your products
in his area in order to sell them on to his customers) or to an agency
agreement (where the agent procures sales on your behalf and receives a
commission). It is probably better to explore these routes before making
costly commitments in setting up a local subsidiary or a branch. Your choice
will also depend on your long-term strategy.
If you already sell in Germany but want to establish a local presence to
increase sales you may want to set up your own organisation locally. This
will involve setting up a local company, probably a private company known as
a GmbH or a branch (Zweigniederlassung). A subsidiary will require its own
capital and is a legal entity in its own right, with limited liability.
A branch is merely an extension of the company abroad and has no separate
legal identity. From an accounting and tax point of view, however, there is
little difference.
Travel insurance in the Netherlands
Q: I recently bought an air ticket in Amsterdam for a client in another
country but was told I could only insure against loss if I was a resident or
national in the Netherlands. Is this true?
A: There is no national legislation in the Netherlands stipulating that
non-residents or nationals are excluded from taking out an insurance policy.
Neither are there any legal constraints on the opening of bank accounts by
non-residents.
However, travel insurance companies have no legal obligation to sell an
insurance policy and may refuse a request from an individual or company
which they consider represents an increased risk.
Some of the smaller companies will not accept non-resident customers because
of the increased administrative burden. Larger companies, however, are
normally prepared to do business with both residents and non-residents.
Since there is no existing or proposed EC legislation in this specific area
the regulations may vary from country to country.
Recycling computer equipment
Q: Is there any EC legislation governing the recycling of computer equipment
in the EC?
A: At the moment there is no EC legislation specifically governing the
recycling of computer equipment. However, the commission has defined general
policy goals for the recycling of waste for re-use as raw materials or
energy, the prevention of waste generation and the safe and orderly
development of the waste disposal industry.
The guiding principle behind the community's waste programme is that the
disposal of waste is carried out to the highest possible level of protection
for the environment and for health.
With this in mind, the commission has developed a plan for the prevention of
pollution from waste known as the Community Waste Management Strategy. This
is set out in a Commission Communication (SEC(89) 934). Emphasis is placed
on waste prevention and then on recycling, re-use and the 'optimisation' of
waste which is disposed of when not re-used.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Small fry on big shelves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Small food producers and big supermarket chains could both benefit from
closer co-operation.
But the small companies must gear up to meet the supermarket's quality and
delivery requirements while the retailers must make themselves more
accessible to small suppliers.
Achieving these objectives lies behind a food industry initiative being
managed by Strathclyde University.
It aims to help small regional suppliers win more shelf space in the big
supermarkets. The initiative includes regional meetings between small
suppliers and supermarket buyers and seminars to spread good practice.
New information technology and scanning systems mean that it is now easier
for large multiples to put products on sale in a small number of stores.
Like most sectors of the economy the food processing industry is mostly made
up of a large number of small enterprises and a few large firms, according
to a report* by the Strathclyde Food Project team.
These companies are often unable to supply products consistently and on time
for national distribution and have problems communicating with the
headquarters of large retailers. They are often undercapiTalised and lack
access to product-testing facilities.
However, they have a number of strengths including an innovative approach to
new products and product processing, product specialisation and a knowledge
of their local markets.
To benefit from using more small suppliers, supermarkets may need to
establish a small business desk to oversee contacts with new or small
suppliers or appoint a liaison officer to deal with contacts, the report
suggests.
As part of the initiative the project team is keen to increase awareness
among business support organisations of the problems of small food
producers.

Calculating PAYE returns for employees is a chore for small business owners
and carries the risk that mistakes can lead to the imposition of penalties
and interest charges. A frequent area of confusion is which non-salary
benefits should be included in the total for gross pay.
A handy guide to which items should be included in payroll calculations and
which should be left out has been compiled by accountants Blick Rothenberg.
It covers items such as vouchers, season tickets, private medical schemes,
club membership and home telephones.

Many small business owners depend on a supportive wife or husband.
Recognition of the important role a spouse can play in business success has
come with the launch of a pilot European Community scheme entitled Spouses
in Businesses.
Experimental courses will be run this month in Britain, by Gloucestershire
Training and Enterprise Council, and in Denmark. The results of the two
schemes will be compared for possible extension of the programme to other EC
countries.
Spouses will be taught the basics of financial control, sales and marketing
and leadership skills and given guidance on legal issues and dealing with
accountants.
The course will also advise on the interpersonal skills needed by working
couples. Twelve people have been selected to take part in the first, free,
course.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Economics: Narrow UK money supply in spotlight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are few economic indicators in the UK this week, although provisional
narrow money supply figures for April will generate interest. Rapid year -
on - year growth in M0 has been cited as evidence that consumer spending is
recovering. M0 has remained above the upper limit of the government's 0-4
per cent monitor range since February and, according to the latest median
forecast, grew at a buoyant 5 per cent in the year to April.
Given the recent upbeat comments of the Prime minister and the Chancellor
about the state of the UK economy, Friday's monthly monetary report is also
likely to be modestly optimistic. But the Treasury will be cautious about
sounding too enthusiastic. Many analysts expect economic activity to show
temporary signs of faltering before the year is over, similar to the pattern
of recovery in the US.
In the US, non-farm payroll figures at the end of the week will once again
throw the spotlight on the strength of recovery. Last week, disappointing
GDP figures pointed to a slowdown in consumer spending and weakening
exports. But April's figures should show a rebound and economists are
forecasting a 150,000 rise in non-farm payrolls.
There is also a rush of data from Germany this week. March's industrial
production and manufacturing new orders are both projected to fall as
recession deepens. However, economists do not expect the Bundesbank to
announce a further cut in official rates at its regular council meeting.
Other economic highlights of the week follow. The figures in brackets are
the median of economists forecasts from MMS international, a financial
information company.
Yesterday: US, April NAPM index (53 per cent); March construction spending
(down 1 per cent). UK, national holiday, all markets closed. Japan, national

BAT Industries, the UK-based tobacco and financial services group, will be

The decision by US tobacco group Philip Morris to slash prices in April had
no impact on BAT's figures to the end of March, which are expected to show
pre-tax profits up from Pounds 258m to about Pounds 350m. But the UK group's
share price has fallen by 17 per cent since the price cuts started and
analysts will be keen to get an update. The results will include a currency
gain of about Pounds 30m, but also reflect stronger performance by BAT's
insurance subsidiaries, Eagle Star in the UK and Farmers in the US.
British Petroleum is expected to show on Thursday a slight decline in its
replacement cost profit for the first quarter when compared with the final
quarter last year.
Mr Nick Antill at Hoare Govett estimates the company will make Pounds 190m
compared with Pounds 200m.
In the same period last year, BP posted a profit of Pounds 89m.
But BP will have done well to keep the result fairly stable when oil prices
and refining margins have declined, leading to a downturn in pre-tax
operating profits. This will be partly offset by lower interest and tax
charges and a dollar-sterling exchange rate boost.
Refining margins in Asia improved and chemicals are expected to be no worse
than last year. Tate &amp; Lyle is expected to report tomorrow a rise in interim
pre-tax profits of about 15 per cent to Pounds 103m.
Royal Bank of Scotland, also reporting interim results the same day, is
forecast to produce pre-tax profits of about Pounds 65m after bad debt
provisions against Pounds 48m a year earlier. Positive factors include flat
costs, rising fee income and widening mortgage spreads.
Bank of Scotland, on Thursday, is expected to report flat pre-tax profits
for the year ended February of about Pounds 140m. Operating profits will
have grown by about 12 per cent but bad debt provisions have risen.
