FT  29 APR 93 / Total plans FFr4bn capital increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOTAL, the French oil group, has concluded plans for a FFr4.07bn (Pounds
480m) capital increase with three new minority investors as the first step
towards creating a group of friendly shareholders to take long-term stakes
in the company.
Total is selling new shares representing 7 per cent of its equity to Cogema,
the state-controlled nuclear group, Societe Generale, the bank, and the
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez industrial concern. Mr Serge Tchuruk, chairman,
said he hoped to engineer similar deals so that friendly investors
controlled 10 per cent to 12 per cent of Total.
The capital increase, involving Total taking reciprocal stakes in its new
investors and leaving it with FFr2.5bn of additional net cash, comes as
French companies prepare for the new government's privatisation programme.
Total, in which the government retains a 5 per cent direct stake and
indirectly owns 10 per cent of shares through state-controlled companies,
sees the formation of a group of friendly shareholders as a way of
stabilising its equity base.
The stock market reacted badly to the capital increase, which excludes
ordinary shareholders and assembles defensive shareholdings to defuse the
threat of changes in ownership. Total's shares fell 1.56 per cent to
FFr265.10.
Cogema has agreed to pay FFr2.5bn for a 4.3 per cent stake in Total and to
buy the latter's uranium interests for FFr1bn. Total plans to invest
FFr1.5bn in Cogema to acquire a 10 per cent holding. Societe Generale, a
long-standing adviser to Total, will take a 2 per cent stake in the oil
group in return for contributing FFr1bn to its shareholders' funds. Total
will buy 1 per cent of the bank for FFr500m. Lyonnaise will invest FFr500m
in Total, emerging with a 2 per cent stake. Total will then spend FFr500m to
take a 20 per cent holding in Ufiner-Cofreth, a Lyonnaise heating and energy
subsidiary.
Total said the transactions will help reduce net debt from FFr14.5bn to
FFr12bn and increase shareholders' funds from FFr46.8bn to FFr51bn. Gearing
will fall from 31 per cent to 24 per cent, helping it with plans to double
its oil and gas reserves by the end of the century.

FT  29 APR 93 / BTP agrees to pay Pounds 100m for MTM assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTP, the fine chemical company, is to pay Pounds 100m for most of the assets
of MTM, the fine chemical company under investigation by the Serious Fraud
Office and operating under the sufferance of its banks.
The deal has given BTP a substantial chemicals manufacturing base in the US,
where MTM's most profitable factory is based, and what the company calls a
'chemistry kit' of substantially under-utilised plant.
Funded by a two-for-five rights issue at 185p, the deal increases BTP's
equity by 40 per cent but doubles its net assets.
MTM's banks, led by Chase Manhattan, will write off Pounds 30m of the Pounds
120m debt they are owed and make available Pounds 10m of new money to MTM.
In return they will take a 29.9 per cent stake in this rump company, which
is left with an agro-chemical business breaking even on sales of Pounds 20m.
Before BTP approached them, the banks had been considering a Pounds 40m debt
write-off in return for 80 per cent equity in MTM. That deal would have left
them with an uncertain and painfully slow work-out and heavily diluted
existing shareholders. Under the new deal the banks receive Pounds 90m
almost immediately. The MTM operating companies have a chance to escape from
12 months of management turmoil and the debilitating effect of having to
find sufficient cash to meet Pounds 8m of professional fees connected with
the rescue. Some MTM shareholders were yesterday grateful that Mr Ken
Schofield, MTM chairman, had retrieved something for them. MTM's assets are
understood to have been valued at about Pounds 80m in a liquidation.
However, some shareholders  - who stumped up 140p a share in MTM's last
rights issue in 1990 - are expected to ask why BTP only bought the assets.
BTP said yesterday it would have made a full bid but the SFO inquiries into
MTM's profits would have made a rights issue underwriting very difficult.
BTP is buying Pounds 82m of assets. These include profitable plants at
Hardwicke, South Carolina, and Leek and John Ross in the UK. In addition
there are loss-making plants at Rock Hill in the US and Kirkby and Teesport,
which BTP says are under-utilised but 'well suited to BTP's expansion
requirements'.
Mr Frank Buckley, BTP chairman, said the acquisitions would be an excellent
bridgehead into the US and that the group had sufficient business to put
into the Teesport and Kirkby plant.
BTP will raise Pounds 72.2m through the rights issue. The balance will come
from debt - which increases to Pounds 30m and leaves the company with
gearing of about 26 per cent.
BTP's share price rose 11p to 250p while MTM fell 1p to close at 10.5p.

FT  29 APR 93 / Ciampi chooses a broad team: Italian ex-communists to work
with Christian Democrats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR CARLO Azeglio Ciampi last night broke the post-war mould of Italian
politics by including former communists and a member of the Green party in a
government that also has Christian Democrats in its ranks.
The 72-year-old premier-designate, who is also the governor of the Bank of
Italy, is the first non-parliamentarian to head a government this century.
He has spent two days trying to form a team to tackle electoral reform and
manage the economy.
His choice of a broadly-based team comes in response to the public's demand
for an era of clean politics after more than a year of damaging revelations
of corruption in the establishment.
For the first time a premier-designate has invoked article 92 of the
constitution which permits the formation of a government without direct
consultation with the party leaders. Until now all post-war governments have
been dictated by party leaders.
This coalition has been closely co-ordinated with President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro and is expected to last as long as it is necessary to draw up
legislation for electoral reform.
The announcement was delayed for more than two hours by reservations from
the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). Three members
accepted positions as ministers - Mr Vincenzo Visco, a prominent economist
as finance minister; Mr Augusto Barbera, a leading member of the referendum
movement, who takes charge of parliamentary relations; and Mr Luigi
Berlinguer as science minister.
A member of the enlarged steering committee of the PDS, Mr Berlinguer is a
cousin of the late Enrico Berlinguer, the Italian Communist party leader who
died in 1984 after breaking his party's ideological isolation. The new
minister is rector of the University of Siena, in Tuscany.
But Mr Achille Occhetto, the PDS leader, insisted the party would judge the
government by its programme. These reservations reflected the strong
internal divisions within the party over taking part in government after
being in opposition as the Communist party since 1948.
Among the other novelties is the presence of 38-year-old Mr Sandro Rutelli,
who recently failed to become elected the Green mayor of Rome, as
environment minister.
Of the portfolios that remain unchanged, the Treasury minister stays in the
hands of Mr Piero Barucci and the interior ministry continues to be headed
by the Christian Democrat, Mr Nicola Mancino. The foreign ministry was given
to the economist, Mr Nino Andreatta, who is the outgoing finance minister.
Mr Ciampi had earlier failed to persuade Mr Giuliano Amato, the outgoing
prime minister, to take the job. The new economic team includes Professor
Luigi Spaventa, a former fellow of All Souls, Oxford, as budget minister.
The cabinet, to be sworn in today, must now face the test of parliamentary
approval. But the presence of three ministers of the PDS, Greens and
Republicans ensures an ample parliamentary base beyond the outgoing
four-party coalition.

FT  29 APR 93 / Equal pensions 'do not have to be back dated'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS in the European Community do not have to pay equal pensions to men
and women for service before May 17 1990, the date of a key ruling on pay
equality, according to a recommendation yesterday from the advocate-general
to the European Court of Justice.
Making the 1990 ruling fully retrospective could have cost EC employers up
to Pounds 100bn.
It is for the court to accept or reject the advocate-general's opinion in
four pending cases, but it almost always follows his advice.
In a 53-page document which is expected to guide the court's final ruling,
the advocate-general advised unequivocally that employers should not be
liable for additional payments to male workers for any period before its
judgment in the case of Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange.
The cases involve two British schemes, one German scheme and one Dutch. The
main arguments are contained in a case involving former employees of
Coloroll, the UK home furnishings company now in liquidation.
The advocate-general also advised that in making lump-sum retirement
benefits, employers must not take into account that women live longer than
men.
In these schemes, employees purchase an annuity which will provide them with
monthly income for the rest of their lives. Because women live longer, they
need bigger lump sums to buy the same benefit.
Lawyers in the case said it was unclear whether employers are barred from
giving bigger lump sums to women.
The advocate-general also advised that employers were free to worsen pension
provision for women in their efforts to equalise payments to both sexes.
Across Europe, occupational schemes have typically set men's retirement age
at 65 while allowing women to receive a pension at 60.

FT  29 APR 93 / German union votes to strike in east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IG METALL, Germany's powerful engineering union, won overwhelming support
yesterday for the first official strikes in eastern Germany for more than 60
years.
More than 86 per cent of eastern German steel employees affiliated to IG
Metall voted for strike action, which may start next week.
The vote was equally overwhelming among metal and electrical workers in
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, and Saxony, the only two states balloted for
the sector.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the union's president, said the vote showed that 'all
dreams had died that IG Metall might not be prepared to fight in east
Germany'.
Gesamtmetall, the metal and electrical employers association, said higher
wages, coupled with low productivity, would 'dry up investment. This is
economically suicidal'.
Mr Herbert Hax, one of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's special economic advisers,
said: 'In the end, this (strike) would lead to a decline in investment,
which is urgently needed for rebuilding east Germany.'
Arbeitgeberverband Stahl, the steel employers' association, said IG Metall
was 'using eastern German workers as a means of boosting its flagging
support and power in the west'.
By using the threat of a strike, IG Metall wants to reinstate a contract,
ended last month by the employers, which would have equalised eastern and
western German wages by April 1994. The union says the employers broke the
contract not for economic reasons but to end the postwar system of
collective wage bargaining. The employers deny this.
The contract would have obliged employers to pay wage increases this year of
more than 20 per cent to the metal, electrical and steel sectors. The
employers are recommending about 9 per cent, matching the region's annual
inflation rate. Eastern German wages are about 70 per cent of western German
levels, but productivity lags behind western Germany by as much as 70 per
cent.
IG Metall, clearly encouraged by the outcome of the ballot, will hold a
special meeting today to decide where and when to hold the strikes. They
might start as early as May 3, but some of the employers' associations are
hoping the deadlock can be broken this weekend.
A meeting, called by the metal and electrical employers, will be held with
IG Metall tomorrow in the eastern state of Thuringia, even though the union
has repeatedly said it would negotiate only if employers reinstated the
contract.
The union said: 'This is not a real negotiation. In any case, wage policy is
made in Frankfurt' - IG Metall's federal headquarters. Gesamtmetall said
Cologne - its headquarters - would determine the status of the meeting.
However, an official of the steel employers said the meeting might move
towards a compromise: 'IG Metall cannot admit it is dropping its
preconditions.'

FT  29 APR 93 / The Lex Column: BTP/MTM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
By making its second rights issue in just over a year - this time to buy the
assets of MTM - BTP is behaving like a growth stock. Yet the dividend will
be increased again despite lower earnings per share and cover of less than
1.5 times. That entrenches the yield on the shares well above the market
average. In a rational world there would be a case for BTP retaining more
profit and making fewer rights issues. The presence on the share register of
the ICI, British Rail and British Coal pension funds - institutions attached
to real dividend growth - might explain its generosity. Since the shares
rose 4 per cent yesterday against a falling market, keeping the institutions
sweet has a logic of its own.
That is not to deny the attractions of the deal with MTM. By declining to
make a full bid, BTP has side-stepped any potential problems arising from
MTM's murky past. Instead it gets much needed production capacity in the US
and the chance to squeeze more from some under-worked assets. The Kirkby
chemicals plant made a loss of Pounds 2.5m on sales of Pounds 3.3m last
year, so some improvement should not be difficult. If BTP can deliver on its
promise to move three loss-making businesses into profit within 6 months,
the rights issue will not dilute earnings per share.
The worry is whether BTP can manage the transition from small regional
company to international group. If it can keep a firm grip, even the pension
funds might come to accept less income and more capital growth.

Judging by yesterday's statement, the EC Commission has taken a look at the
slowly thawing European telecoms market and decided to stick it back in the
freezer for five years. While there were many fine words about openness and
competition, the defensive tone told the real story. The result may be a
compromise between foot-draggers like Deutsche Telekom and the hyperactive
BT, but it is evidently one which still embarrasses the Brussels
bureaucrats.
Even when nominal competition is allowed in 1998, freer markets may not
develop unless charges for connection to national systems are priced
correctly. National companies in Spain, Italy and Germany are still
absorbing cash updating their networks and will want to hold off financially
stronger competitors like BT as long as possible. Most probably, early
skirmishes will involve companies leasing lines from each other and
reselling the capacity to corporate customers; BT digging up the streets of
Frankfurt is much further off. Since margins are high there is plenty of
room for prices to fall. Continental companies will then have to press for
higher domestic charges because an effective cross-subsidy has been removed.
Meanwhile BT's restlessness will probably compel it to keep searching in the
US - hence the recent interest in acquiring EDS. If transatlantic
deregulation makes progress, BT's nascent cash pile seems likely to end up
in American hands. Whether it can find the right partner, however, remains
to be seen.

FT  29 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Total
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign investors who hold 40 per cent of the French Total group may have
been irritated by the way it unilaterally increased its share capital by 7
per cent and took cross-shareholdings in three other businesses. Indeed
Anglo-Saxon annoyance may have partly accounted for the 2 per cent fall in
Total's share price yesterday. But that is how capitalism works in France.
In theory, shareholders should have little complaint about the financial and
industrial outcome for Total.
France's second biggest oil company will receive a net capital injection of
FFr2.5bn, which will cut gearing by 7 percentage points to 24 per cent.
There will be no dilution of earnings. Total will benefit from the sale of
its peripheral uranium interests to Cogema and should reap considerable
trading advantages through its link-up with Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez's
energy subsidiary. Its stronger balance sheet will permit more aggressive
exploration activities, perhaps in the North Sea and Indonesia. By pushing
Lasmo's share price up 3p yesterday, the UK market guessed at an alternative
route for development.
Though the French government has nominally reduced its direct shareholding
from 32 per cent to 5 per cent, it still wields considerable indirect
influence. Many French companies currently heading for privatisation will
doubtless see similar virtues in 'stabilising' their shareholder base, but
Total's share price fall is a reminder that, in a global market, such
behaviour carries a price.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
London had a worrying day yesterday. Heavy futures selling drove the FT-SE
100 down by 35 points. The gilts market decided the auction result was not
quite good enough and dropped over a point at the long end. There are benign
explanations for both developments. If US speculators really are selling
equity futures, the heat could be off quite quickly as their short positions
are closed. The gilts market could simply be coming back to earth after
allowing auction expectations to run away with themselves.
The trouble with the first point is that such bear raids only work in
markets that are anyway subject to some degree of uncertainty. As for the
second, the gilts market simply cannot afford to lose its composure when it
faces calls of Pounds 3bn as well, presumably, as another large auction
within the next month. Both markets have reason to worry about institutional
liquidity, but the attack on the equity market looks well-timed after this
week's economic news. It was not positive enough to change expectations of
corporate earnings, but it was sufficient to kill any lingering hopes of
lower interest rates.
With the gilt auctions now in full swing, the equity market has reached the
stage where it needs reassurance on government funding before it can see the
way ahead. That is not easy when the gold price is up and D-mark bonds are
weak. In the absence of a base rate cut which would steepen the yield curve,
a rising currency might attract overseas money into gilts. Disconcertingly,
though, sterling again failed to remain over DM2.50 yesterday despite a
larger than expected cut in the Bundesbank's money market repurchase rate.

FT  29 APR 93 / Investors write off holdings in Accountancy Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS representing 40 per cent of the shares in Accountancy Television,
the late-night BBC weekly subscription programme produced by and for
accountants, have written off their holdings.
The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants states in its 1992 annual
report, released yesterday, that it has written off its entire Pounds
250,000 stake. Earlier this year, BPP Holdings, a financial training company
which holds shares worth Pounds 350,000, took similar action.
Mr David Bishop, president of the certified accountants, said his
organisation's policy was always to write off educational projects of this
sort, although the accounts do not make that statement.
BPP's write-off reflected what the company called 'a high-risk venture whose
future must be regarded as uncertain during this early critical period'.
Accountancy TV, which is broadcast by BBC Select, the late-night
subscription service, began broadcasting in October and has run into several
setbacks.
Mr Mike Lickiss, chairman of the company and a senior partner in Grant
Thornton, the accountancy firm, confirmed that the service was Pounds
300,000 behind projections.
He said he was still confident about the company but it would not make
profits until the end of 1994, at least six months beyond last year's
projections.
The other main BBC Select services for people in business and lawyers seem
to be going considerably better.
Mr Peter Brindley, chief executive of Legal Network Television, launched in
February, said last night: 'We are ahead of target. We have had a very good
launch.'
The company, whose shareholders are the College of Law, BBC Select and the
Law Society, broadcasts two half-hour programmes a week.
Mr Roy Bass, marketing director of the Executive Business Club, which
launched 10 months ago, said the service had taken Pounds 1.5m in
subscriptions and was on target.
Mr John Radcliffe, managing director of BBC Select, said he was happy with
progress but conceded that recession had made it more difficult to raise
money for new services.
Total shareholdings in Accountancy TV are Pounds 1.5m. The other investors
are BBC Select, the three chartered accountancy bodies covering the UK and
Ireland, and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants.
There were initial differences between the five professional accountancy
bodies over the level of coverage provided to each of them. Difficulties
with the broadcast technology meant the company had to distribute some of
its early programmes by videotape.
In spite of initial optimistic projections that the company had attracted
interest from 11,000 potential subscribers, only a few more than 600 have
signed up.
Depsite market research which suggested the main audience was industry and
commerce the programmes were initially geared at least as much towards
accountants in practice.
The actual take-up proved, as predicted, to be mainly from business, and
Accountancy TV has had to modify its programmes to reflect that.

FT  29 APR 93 / Honda to chase UK assembly record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONDA, the Japanese carmaker, intends that by the end of the year its UK
assembly plant will rival Nissan's Sunderland operation, Europe's most
productive car assembly plant.
Mr Andrew Jones, manager of Honda's Pounds 300m plant in Swindon, Wiltshire,
said the company aimed to achieve an assembly time of 12.5 hours a car for
its large family car, the Honda Accord.
The Swindon plant started production in October and aims to reach its
capacity of 100,000 cars a year with two car ranges in 1995.
Productivity at Japanese carmakers' new plants in Europe, mainly in the UK,
is setting tough standards for European producers, whose productivity is
often half the best Japanese levels.
Mr Ian Gibson, managing director of Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK, said it
had cut 'hours per car' for its UK-built Primera - similar in size to the
Accord - to 12.5.
He said 'the best of the Europeans are running at around 20 hours per car'
for the same class of vehicle.
European competitors in this market segment include the Opel Vectra/Vauxhall
Cavalier, Ford Mondeo, Peugeot 405 and Volkswagen Passat.
The hours-per-car yardstick used by Nissan and Honda measures so-called
direct labour in the body welding, painting and final trim and assembly
parts of the manufacturing operation.
These processes are becoming established as a standard definition in
measuring car plant productivity.
Carmakers differ on the measurement of hours in their plants, but the size
of the competitive gap has startled European producers.

FT  29 APR 93 / Leading Article: Dilemmas for Mr Lamont
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF NORMAN Lamont had known before the Budget what he knows now, would he
still have postponed his tax increases to next year? Some advised him to
increase taxes at once. He may already regret having ignored this advice.
The case for postponing tax increases in March was that they were likely to
extinguish the flickering flame of economic recovery. But there were also
arguments in favour of raising taxes immediately. The obvious argument was
that the fiscal position was unsustainable in the longer term, while any
deflationary impact of tax increases could be offset by reductions in
interest rates. An additional, under-emphasised, concern was about what
would happen if recovery were to come before the fiscal action. The
government would then rely on monetary policy as its sole disinflationary
instrument. The consequence could be appreciation of the exchange rate and
loss of competitiveness.
In its latest World Economic Outlook, the International Monetary Fund gives
concern about competitiveness little weight. But it is robust in its call
for a smaller budget deficit.
'The sustainability of the recovery,' argues the IMF, 'will depend on the
authorities' ability to safeguard the credibility of their anti-inflationary
commitment, especially in light of the potential inflationary consequences
of sterling's decline. This, in turn, depends critically on the adoption of
further measures, in the 1994 budget or even before (our emphasis), to
secure a faster reduction of the large budget deficit. . . . Any further
easing of monetary policy . . . should be resisted unless there is good
reason to believe that a further cut in interest rates would not endanger
the goal of containing inflation.'
Credibility undermined
The IMF is right on fiscal policy. The credibility of the anti-inflationary
commitment must be doubtful in the case of a government planning to borrow 9
per cent of gross domestic product this year and double its net debt, in
relation to GDP, in just half a decade. Credibility is further undermined by
willingness to borrow at 8 1/2 per cent over 20 years, when its target rate
of inflation in the medium term is 1-4 per cent and its announced aim is 'to
bring it down to the lower part of this range by the end of the present
parliament'.
More questionable is what the IMF has to say about monetary policy. Two
concerns might arise. The first is whether policy has provided enough
stimulation. The second is whether it is paying enough attention to
competitiveness.
Interest rates
The case for cuts in interest rates to stimulate domestic demand is weaker
than a month or two ago. Recovery is now unmistakable, while monetary data
are also showing a greenish light. Over the three months to March narrow
money (M0) grew at an annual rate of 9.9 per cent, while broad money growth
(M4) accelerated to 5.3 per cent. The former is well above its monitoring
range of 0 to 4 per cent, while the latter is at least within its wider
range of 3 to 9 per cent.
The difficult question is competitiveness. The exchange rate is the most
important relative price in the economy. Given the social and economic costs
of shifting resources into - and out of - industries producing tradable
goods and services, the government must not ignore the level of the exchange
rate or its variability. For a country with a current account deficit of 2
per cent of GDP at the trough of a recession, it seems particularly risky to
ignore competitiveness. But sterling has already appreciated from DM2.33 at
the end of February to just below DM2.50, while its trade-weighted effective
rate is up nearly 7 per cent.
The chancellor may well have been right to welcome this appreciation, since
the devaluation had left competitiveness at exceptional levels, at least by
standards of the 1980s. But appreciation should not be welcomed without
limits. Particularly if monetary growth seems subdued, the chancellor should
respond to any sustained appreciation by cutting interest rates. To do that
safely, however, he must also be more aggressive over fiscal policy next
time than he was in March.

Whence comes the new pep in John Major's speeches? Even the weary ears of
Westminster have perked up at the tighter style, the steadier tone. Some of
his jokes are now even vaguely amusing.
Part of the reason, of course, is that his confidence is recovering along
with the economy and the approaching ratification of the Maastricht treaty.
Another, according to Downing Street officials, is that the PM is putting
more time into drafting his texts, though still not as much as the 50 or
more hours per spiel typically invested by his predecessor.
What the officials don't say, however, is that a helping hand is being lent
by sharp-witted civil servant Dominic Morris, now come from the Trade and
Industry Department to No 10, where he has joined Sarah Hogg's policy unit.
Just 39, and said to be a natural wordsmith, he has wrought his craft on
each of the premier's recent speeches.
He is no stranger to No 10, having worked there for four years under Lady
Thatcher. But the credit for spotting his talent belongs to the present
incumbent.

FT  29 APR 93 / Observer: Double act departs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the departure in May next year of Cazenove's joint senior partners John
Kemp-Welch and Anthony Forbes comes the end of one of the City's more
remarkable double acts.
In the mid-1980s, when the pukka stockbroker stood stubbornly aside from the
wave of mergers reshaping the surrounding landscape, many were inclined to
write it off as a force in the City. Today, as old rivals such as Hoare
Govett have been eclipsed, it looks stronger than ever.
Forbes, whose beat was corporate finance, and Kemp-Welch, the broker of the
pair, depart after 14 years atop a company that boasts more than 40 of the
FT-SE 100 companies among its clients.
'We could have gone on for a few more years, but it really wouldn't have
given our successor generation a fair crack of the whip,' explains the
ever-correct Kemp-Welch who, at 58, is two years older then Forbes.
Step up 49-year-old corporate finance specialist Mark Loveday. At Cazenove a
mere 27 years, and godson of former senior partner Antony Hornby, he
leapfrogs from seventh place on the letterhead, no mean feat in the status-
conscious world of a broking company which to the outsider sometimes looks
as if it has been stuck in a time-warp since the 1950s.
Two of those further up that all-important letterhead are David Mayhew, head
of the company's syndication department, and David Barnett, who runs the
secondary market operation. Kemp-Welch seems to think both will work closely
with Loveday, forming a virtual triumvirate at the top.
Its dominance of the domestic UK corporate broking market may be
unquestioned, but is Cazenove in danger of looking a shade anachronistic in
a world where more companies are looking to sell shares internationally
rather than in just one market?
On past experience it would be wrong to write the firm off.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
To most managers of Britain's sub-post offices the idea of one day having
Cazenove as brokers and Warburgs as advisers must be at best a remote
prospect. Certainly Frank Buckley couldn't have expected to become a pillar
of the business establishment when he bought his sub office in Bispham, near
Blackpool, in 1969.
Today, of course, he is chairman of BTP, the former British Tar Products,
which has just paid Pounds 100m for most of the assets of run-down
fine-chemicals company MTM.
Buckley took the Bispham shop after quitting Allied Chemical Corp of the US,
fed up with the conformism of American corporate life. Then an old buddy
working with PA Consulting Group asked him to help sell the City a line.
At the time British Tar's shares were languishing at 1s 3d apiece. He was
given the aim of doubling the price to half a crown by writing a script
extolling the glowing future lying before investors in tar.
In the event, the writing never got done. Instead he went on to transform
BTP into a significant exporter.
Such success has its costs, of course. The past week has been purgatory for
the sprightly 64-year-old with a bon viveur appetite and a love of claret.
Locked in negotiations within the walls of Warburgs, he has been kept on
iron rations of sandwiches and pizza.

FT  29 APR 93 / Personal View: Hidden flaws in school testing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Lord SKIDELSKY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'National testing is a vital element of our drive for higher standards in
schools,' proclaims the schools minister, Eric Forth. Yet it is obvious that
testing itself does nothing to raise standards. It is like taking a person's
temperature. A test simply tells you something about the condition of the
pupil. The single aim of testing of any kind is to produce information. It
is the quality of the information and how it is used that determine whether
standards go up or down or change not at all.
A high temperature tells a doctor something is wrong, not what is wrong. For
that, other tests may be needed. By analogy, there are different kinds of
school tests, designed to reveal different things.
The 1987 report of the Task Group on Assessment and Training, chaired by
Professor Paul Black, listed four purposes of testing:
Formative, for deciding 'appropriate next steps' in a pupil's study.
Diagnostic, to identify 'learning difficulties'.
Summative, recording what a pupil has learnt.
Evaluative, to compare one school with others.
The TGAT report took two crucial decisions. The first was that it would be
impracticable to have different tests for different purposes. Secondly, it
argued that while it was possible to use formative/ diagnostic tests for
summative/ evaluative purposes, the reverse was not true. Tests designed to
record what had been learnt over a given period could not, by definition,
show what needed to be done to improve learning in that period.
The main conclusion the report drew was that the purpose of assessment
should be formative/ diagnostic. However, the assessments could also be used
to make summative judgments on individual pupils, and evaluate the
performance of schools over the same period, if a common basis of
progression in relation to national targets could be worked out. But these
additional tasks were strictly subordinate to the main purpose, which was to
help teachers improve the learning of individual pupils.
These conclusions of the TGAT report are the source of the present trouble
over testing in schools. The report barely concealed its hostility to using
national assessment to 'evaluate the work of the education service'. But the
government's strategy for raising educational standards was to do just that.
The report enshrined the principle of teacher-controlled continuous
assessment which is at odds with the notion of end-of-key-stage testing of
seven-, 11- and 14-year-olds. Since the government was eager to get the
principle of regular testing established, it fudged this uncomfortable
philosophic divide in accepting the TGAT proposals.
The fact is that tests which explicitly aim to help learning will be
different from tests which aim to measure the results of teaching - it is
doubtful whether even the same word should be used for the two.
This became clear in 1991 when the first so-called tests for seven-year-olds
in English, arithmetic and science arrived in the schools. They required
dozens of 'standard assessment tasks' which took half a term to administer,
and came with recording instructions of Byzantine complexity. Since then,
end-of-key-stage tests have been slimmed down to improve 'manageability'.
But the more manageable - that is, shorter - the tests become, the more
unlike teacher assessment they look.
The simmering dispute has come to the boil with the national curriculum
English tests for 14-year-olds to be taken this summer. Teachers have
attacked poor timing, poor quality and increased workload. But the gut
issues have also emerged clearly. Who controls the tests? What are they for?
No review of the 'manageability' of national assessment can duck these
questions. The logical solution would be to separate teacher assessment from
end-of-stage tests, which should be externally set and marked, possibly by a
consortium of test boards. This would reverse the key decision of the TGAT
report not to have different tests for different purposes. Teachers'
workload as well as the time pupils would have to spend on the tests would
be reduced. But the reform would also disclose the real ground of teachers'
complaint: the use of tests that they do not control to pass judgments on
their performance.
Accountability requires information. The information required to judge
schools cannot be controlled by the schools. If the boycott of this summer's
tests brings greater understanding of this single point, then it will have
done some good.

FT  29 APR 93 / Competition on the line: AT&amp;T's bid for a UK licence heralds
an upheaval in the telecommunications market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ignore reports that workmen will soon be digging up Britain's streets to lay
telephone cables for new rivals to British Telecom and Mercury.
Yesterday's statement on telecommunications liberalisation by the European
Commission lays down a five-year timetable for full liberalisation of
services, so open competition within the Community is a few years off at
least.
Closer on the horizon are bulldozers of US origin. American Telephone and
Telegraph, the largest US telecoms operator, is seeking a UK public
telecommunications licence, and wants to sell services both between the UK
and the US and within the UK itself.
However, it will be months before Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, decides whether to grant the licence. In January 1992 Sprint, the
third-largest US voice carrier, applied for licences to build its own
network and buy and sell services in the UK. It is still awaiting a
decision.
Far wider issues than the merits of the individual applications are at
stake. AT&amp;T and BT are engaged in a battle for direct access to each other's
public networks. AT&amp;T's application for a UK licence was preceded by an
application by BT to the Federal Communications Commission, the US
telecommunications regulator, to allow it to buy and sell services in the
US.
Both sides are now locked in argument before the commission about the terms
on which transatlantic competition should take place. AT&amp;T has called on the
regulator to reject all BT's applications unless it is granted fair access
to the UK market; BT will lodge a detailed rebuttal today.
At the end of the day, it will almost certainly take a ministerial-level
agreement to resolve the issue. BT is asking to be treated as a non-dominant
carrier in the US, despite its grip over the UK market, while AT&amp;T wants to
see far greater transparency in the treatment of competing companies in the
UK. It also objects to having to negotiate with BT over access charges and
service quality.
What will Britain's telecoms market look like if the US operators are given
the green light? And how keen are customers for competitors to BT and its UK
rival Mercury, which is now able to reach 90 per cent of Britain and claims
to have cornered 10 per cent of the market?
Even if AT&amp;T and Sprint get in, they will not be the only new players.
Ionica, a private company, gained a UK operators' licence earlier this year
and aims to establish a national radio-based network.
Several smaller operators are already reselling leased lines to the US
connected to the public network on one side of the Atlantic only, under 1991
rules liberalising the resale market. At the moment it is illegal to resell
lines to the US switched into the public network at both ends (known as
'international simple resale'). But since the reason for the ISR ban is the
supposed absence of a 'level playing field', decisions to allow AT&amp;T and BT
to enter each other's markets will very likely go hand-in-hand with an
Anglo-US ISR agreement.
Ionica apart, the priority for the newcomers will be to take a slice of BT's
lucrative and growing international - particularly transatlantic - business.
So large companies will be the main beneficiaries of greater competition,
initially at least.
AT&amp;T concedes that 'duplication of BT's network by a new entrant is
economically unfeasible, at least in the near term'. Sprint has ideas for
utilising the canal system to build its own network, but it will not be
national for some time. However, the potential transatlantic pickings are
large and immediate: Mr Greg Staple, a Washington consultant, estimates that
US-UK voice traffic will grow from about 1.13bn minutes in 1991 to 1.5bn
this year, and the room to expand the market through new data and
value-added services is enormous.
Prices could tumble. As an opening gambit in its battle with BT, AT&amp;T has
already proposed a cut of about 60 per cent in the accounting rates for
transatlantic calls. The accounting rates, in effect a wholesale price paid
by one national operator to another to deliver international calls to their
final destination, has fallen by nearly half in the past three years. If
AT&amp;T thinks it can cut the rates by half again, that is a fair indication of
how far out of line prices and costs are at present.
Another pointer is the prices being touted by would-be ISR merchants.
Swiftcall, a three-person company which sought (unsuccessfully) to offer ISR
to the US through a link to Canada, was proposing to charge a single rate of
25p a minute for business calls and 28p for residential calls (in both cases
plus the cost of a BT local call to its London office).
Mercury's standard transatlantic rate is 41.1p per minute, falling to 37.5p
on the best-discounted frequent caller programmes after an initial fee of
Pounds 700 a quarter. BT's prices for business customers range from 47.9p a
minute down to 36.5p for heavy users after an initial fee of Pounds 275 a
quarter; its lowest cheap-rate residential tariff is 39p (all prices
exclusive of value-added tax).
The competition will not just be on price, however. Sprint and AT&amp;T also
plan to offer one-stop private network services, all-in maintenance
packages, and to add advanced services not yet marketed widely in the UK,
such as toll-free calling services for businesses. BT wants to offer similar
services in the US.
Do UK companies want this increased choice?
'The more competition the merrier,' says Mr Shaun O'Byrne, technical
services director at Lehman Brothers, the merchant bank. Lehman already uses
three carriers (BT, Mercury, and Worldcom). 'If the price is right, it's no
problem for us to diversify further.'
Lehman is already refusing to sign traditional five-year contracts with BT,
even with discounts as bait. 'It's not worth it - even for a few per cent
off,' says Mr O'Byrne. 'Technology and prices are changing so fast, you are
insane to tie yourself to contracts of more than a year or two.'
On the face of it, most business users agree with him. A recent survey by
the Telecommunications Users Association (TUA), which represents more than
1,100 corporate subscribers, found only 31 per cent believed there was
'adequate' competition, against 65 per cent who wanted more.
The success of Swiss-owned Worldcom, which has been in the market barely 18
months yet already boasts more than 100 corporate customers and an annual
turnover into eight figures, is a fair signal. At present, Worldcom connects
(mainly London-based) customers to its central London exchange by private
lines, and then on resold lines out of the UK. It, too, has an application
pending for a public licence.
Mr David Hardwick, managing director, says: 'Buying telecoms is going to be
like shopping in a supermarket; once it becomes possible - as it will soon -
for more operators to switch freely in and out of the public network, the
hassle for customers in changing telecoms companies will be minimal.'
But business users are attracted not just by price and new services. The TUA
survey found 'general satisfaction' about the quality of existing service,
particularly from BT, and concern that any alternative should be 'trouble
free'.
Mr Paul Burt, communications manager at the International Securities Markets
Association, which confirms and matches Eurobond deals using data
transmission services to link banks and securities houses with its computer
centre, says he learnt 'through experience the consequences of dealing with
inadequately resourced operators'.
ISMS had a contract with a local cable company offering telecom services,
'but it failed to invest to the levels we wanted - and its technical staff
and equipment were simply not up to the standards we needed'.
Small businesses, in particular, are also worried by the growing complexity
of tariff structures, making comparisons of overall costs increasingly
difficult to make.
'Value added is critical, particularly as companies are moving from having
their own private networks and looking to telecoms companies to manage the
lot,' says Mr O'Byrne. 'With the likes of AT&amp;T that shouldn't be a problem;
but I'm not interested in two men in a garage offering resale services.'
Mr Hardwick and most of Worldcom's employees, note, are ex-BT. There are
plenty more where they came from.

FT  29 APR 93 / Leading Article: Diagnosing Africa's ills
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN OXFAM, one of Britain's leading aid agencies, warns that Africa's
economic crisis has put the continent on a knife edge, the world should take
note. From Ethiopia in the mid-1980s to Somalia in the 1990s, Oxfam and
other non-government organisations have sounded alarm bells that have
aroused public opinion and jolted western governments out of complacency or
indifference. This time, says Oxfam, the continent, not just a country, is
in jeopardy.
If its fledgling democracies are to survive and fragile peace agreements are
to hold, sub-Saharan Africa needs more help. Much of its external debt
should be written off; aid flows must be increased; and structural
adjustment programmes reformed, Oxfam argues in its recovery plan for the
region.
Oxfam's proposals would be enhanced by a more detached and comprehensive
examination of the causes of Africa's crisis. It puts most of the blame on
external villains: the IMF and the World Bank; the banks that lent money to
Africa in the 1970s; western governments which spend too much on defence and
too little on aid; industrialised nations which defend protectionist trade
regimes.
A markedly more cautious and inhibited approach characterises Oxfam's
analysis of Africa's shortcomings, past and present. Zaire's Mobutu and
Malawi's Banda are roundly and rightly condemned; but there is no appraisal,
for example, of ex-president Julius Nyerere's disastrous pursuit of African
socialism in Tanzania.
Harmful omissions
The report is right to note that the slump in world commodity prices has
cost Africa dearly. But it overlooks the fact that domestic policy failures
caused Africa's share of the market to fall. Western defence budgets may be
too high; but Africa's own military spending is still excessive.
These omissions undermine Oxfam's assertion that the structural adjustment
policies urged on Africa by the World Bank and the IMF have not halted the
continent's decline. Its analysis suggests that this 'failure' is almost
entirely the fault of the doctor and has little to do with the behaviour of
the patient. Yet in Nigeria and Kenya, World Bank-supported reforms have
been undermined by vested interests and endemic corruption.
Oxfam barely touches on Africa's compelling need to attract foreign
investment. The rate of return on foreign investment dropped from around 30
per cent in the 1960s to 2.5 per cent in the 1980s. Today, Africa's share of
global foreign direct investment is 0.6 per cent.
Alarming symptoms
Whatever the dispute about the cure, however, the symptoms of the disease
are alarming. The external debt crisis is getting worse not better, while
rescheduling has done little more than prolong the agony. Africa's debt was
Dollars 56bn in 1980, 29 per cent of GNP. Twelve years later, further
enervated by war and drought, it owes Dollars 180bn, over 100 per cent of
annual gross national product.
The IMF and the Bank are hard-pressed to find an African country where
structural adjustment has led to a sustained recovery that has not been
supported by continuing aid. Recovery is made all the more difficult by
trade hurdles. The average tariff on cocoa beans, an important African
export, is only 2.6 per cent, on chocolate nearly 12. Such tariff escalation
reinforces Africa's dependence on primary commodities by discouraging
investment in local processing.
However serious the constraints imposed by an unfavourable external
environment, there can be no excuse for the way that Oxfam underplays
domestic shortcomings. This may have something to do with the fact that it
has to live with the governments it criticises. But the report's inhibited
treatment of Africa's faults suggests some members of Oxfam are still
fighting under the banner of a discredited ideology, reluctant to surrender
a vision that harks back to the heyday of African socialism.
Oxfam weakens its own case. Its warning that Africa is in peril is timely.
But to the extent that its assessment of structural adjustment is
inadequate, the alternatives it proposes lose credibility. If Oxfam allows
erring African governments to avoid shouldering their share of the blame for
the continent's crisis, it does a disservice to Africa's citizens.

FT  29 APR 93 / Letter: Welcome recognition for UK exporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, What a delight it was to read Richard Needham's letter (April 21).
Professional exporters throughout the country will welcome the fact that -
at last - a British government minister has recognised reality.
Too often, as the minister for trade pointed out, senior managers of British
companies ignore the real professionalism, the specialised knowledge and
training, and the particular skills that are required of their export staff.
Too often managing directors and finance directors see export as something
at which 'to have a crack' when the domestic market is depressed, with no
thought for strategic planning and long-term goals.
Too often recruitment advertisements for export sales and marketing staff
place emphasis on specific product knowledge (which can be learned in-house
in the new company) and ignore relevant professional export qualifications
and languages.
Too often, jobs columns feature salaries of Pounds 50,000 for life insurance
or IT system sales people, and Pounds 25,000 for export sales staff expected
to cover half the world and make on-the-spot decisions which can affect the
company's entire annual profitability.
Well said, Mr Needam. Let us get serious about exporting. Ian Campbell,

FT  29 APR 93 / Letter: Pragmatic peace plan for Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr P. WRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ian Davidson's dissection of the inadequacies of international
proposals to stop the bloodshed in Bosnia ('Slippery Slopes of Bosnia',
April 26) is much to the point. These proposals do not stand up to proper
scrutiny. History shows that the communities in Bosnia have experienced
political stability only under an externally imposed umbrella. Today, as Mr
Davidson says, such an umbrella can be provided only by very large numbers
of UN troops on the ground.
If the international community is unwilling to commit ground troops in
sufficient numbers on the long time-scale required, then it is also time to
drop the Vance-Owen plan which is past its sell-by date. It is absurd to
suggest that peace can be brought to Bosnia through the creation of a series
of Nagorno-Karabakhs.
Instead, the starting point towards an alternative could be to consider the
behaviour of the Bosnian Croats in the conflict. While the Bosnian Croats,
are as ready as any other group in the conflict to commit atrocities if
their own interests are perceived as threatened, they were also the first
group to agree to the Vance-Owen plan and to give it consistent support
since that time. Why? Simply because the plan did not threaten to disperse
the Bosnian Croats as much as the other groups, mainly concentrating them in
one large territory comfortingly adjacent to the Croat border.
Could not this principle be applied to the other communities, offering them
single, integral, self-governing territories? Using such a framework,
perhaps the Bosnian Serbs could be persuaded to draw back from some
territory in return for a continuous band of territory looping round
northern Bosnia and the border between eastern Bosnia and Serbia.
The role of the UN would then be to guarantee the rights of minorities
choosing to continue to live in territories allocated to a different ethnic
group and to organise and finance the resettlement of people wishing to
move. Surely such pragmatism would be cheaper in human life and financial
resources than taking action which seems certain to escalate the conflict?

MANAGING THE PEACE: THE NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS OF THE UNITED
STATES, 1759 TO THE PRESENT
By Eugene V Rostow
Yale University Press; Dollars 35; 401pp
The education of President Bill Clinton on matters military is approaching a
critical point. This week, or certainly very soon, Mr Clinton must decide
whether to bomb the Serbs, arm the Bosnian Moslems, or swallow his campaign
rhetoric and stick with United Nations sanctions.
Mr Clinton cannot count on support from his European allies; nor can he be
sure that the American public (and The New York Times op-ed page) will stay
the course, should he choose intervention. The question he faces is the one
confronting all Americans at the end of the cold war: what are the national
security interests of the US - the interests most worth fighting for?
Eugene Rostow writes that the chorus of voices urging American isolation
from the troubles of the world is stronger than at any time since the 1930s.
This may be overstated, but not by much. The Democratic party has still to
recover from the Vietnam war. The collapse of the communist threat has led
to the retreat of the internationalist wing of the Republican party and the
rise of the 'Come Home America' crowd led by Mr Pat Buchanan, the TV
commentator who challenged George Bush for the presidential nomination last
year.
Mr Rostow is well-placed to offer an antidote to isolationism. He was
present at the creation of the new engaged US foreign policy in the Truman
administration; he served as deputy secretary of state in the Johnson
administration; and he ended his days as a leading nuclear arms control
negotiator in the Reagan administration, where his hawkish views ultimately
cost him his job.
His book is a powerful plea for an active foreign policy in which the US
remains charged with a leading world role, at least for the foreseeable
future. It contains none of the recent 'new world order' rhetoric which hid
Bush's desire for a cosy US-Soviet partnership operating through the UN. Nor
does the author fall into the trap of glorifying the US as the sole
superpower. The approach is more hard-headed.
His core argument is that the supreme national security interests of the US
lie in the effective functioning of the state system - that is, the
community of nation-states whose relations are governed by diplomatic
convention and international law. Although the US has traditionally been
wary of alliances, it has always been part of this system, despite fond
beliefs to the contrary in the early days of the republic and during the
isolationist 1930s.
Mr Rostow is not seeking a world order of Utopian perfection. He is content
with a world in which the phenomenon of war is kept within tolerable limits.
His model is the so-called 'concert of Europe' which existed between 1815
and 1914. This period was the most tranquil that international society has
known since the Roman empire; but as the author acknowledges, it depended,
crucially, on a balance of power, enforced by the leading nation-states of
the time, or at least a decisive number of them.
The trouble is that Americans have never felt comfortable with
balance-of-power politics, mainly because of its amoral connotations. Look
at their distaste for Chinese human rights abuses; their outcry over
revelations that the US and its western allies shored up Mr Saddam Hussein
in the Iran-Iraq war; or their ambivalence towards Henry Kissinger, the
chief exponent of the balance of power.
Mr Rostow counter-attacks by showing that US presidents, from Washington to
Wilson and Bush, have recognised that the true goal of US foreign policy
should be the pursuit of a balance of power, not a universal crusade for
democracy and human rights.
So Thomas Jefferson, the framer of the Declaration of Independence, was
happy to endorse the survival of monarchies in Europe under threat from
Napoleon. 'Surely none of us wish to see Bonaparte conquer Russia, and lay
thus at his feet the whole continent of Europe. This done, England would be
but a breakfast. . . . No, it cannot be to our interest that Europe should
be reduced to a single monarchy.'
The next step in Mr Rostow's argument is more controversial. His search for
a new concert of powers to manage the peace leads him to the UN, and the
five permanent members of the Security Council. But as he acknowledges, the
Security Council remains hamstrung by the veto provisions of the UN charter
which remain indispensable at this stage in history.
Mr Rostow claims he has an answer: Article 51 of the UN Charter, which
declares that 'nothing shall impair the inherent right of individual or
collective self-defence until the Security Council has taken measures to
maintain international peace and security'. Article 51 offered the legal
rationale for the Korean and Gulf Wars, and it could serve as a tool for
managing the peace.
Turning to the former Yugoslavia, Mr Rostow argues that the US made a costly
mistake in 1991 when the secessionist crisis erupted. Anxious to stay out of
a conflict which promised to be more intractable than the Gulf war, the US
left the issue to the European Community and then the Security Council,
instead of pressing the matter in Nato.
'The strong preference of the US should have been to use Nato as the forum
for devising a peaceful solution of the crisis because of its over-riding
interest in preserving alliance solidarity and the peace of Europe,' he
argues.
The conclusion that Nato should be the political and military manager in
Europe will upset plenty of west Europeans. Some eastern Europeans, anxious
about their own security, are less choosy. If not Nato, what other credible
instrument is available?

FT  29 APR 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Iron curtain in the way of trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Let us imagine that someone had predicted 10 years ago the collapse of
Europe's communist regimes. He would have been dismissed as an optimistic
fool. Suppose that he had then gone on to say that after a hard struggle to
reform their economies, the former communist countries would find their
goods banned by a European Community that claimed to be operating a single
market? He would have been dismissed this time as a Soviet agent trying to
fob off dissidents with horror stories.
Unfortunately, horror stories have a habit of coming true. According to an
analysis by Jim Rollo and Alastair Smith in the April issue of Economic
Policy (published by the Cambridge University Press), between 40 per cent
and 50 per cent of the exports of central and eastern European countries
fall in the 'sensitive' category. This means they are liable to face EC
barriers over and above the modest common external tariff. For Hungary, the
worst hit country, the proportion may be as much as 58 per cent. For Poland
and the former Czechoslovakia it is about 44 per cent.
The percentages are based on the last 'pre-transition' year, 1989. Since
then exports of these sensitive products have risen less than total exports,
Poland being an exception. The high level of EC protection is the most
likely cause of the poor performance of these sensitive sectors.
Three of the most advanced central European countries - Poland, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia (as it then was) - signed 'Europe' agreements with the
Community which came into effect on March 1 1992. Romania and Bulgaria have
subsequently followed suit. These agreements committed the signatories to
industrial free trade to be achieved within 10 years. In principle, the EC
countries will dismantle their barriers faster, in about five years.
Unfortunately, as Rollo and Smith put it, 'there remains a core group of
goods for which substantial protection remains in place, either permanently
or for some years, or for which past protectionist behaviour on the part of
the EC suggests that liberalisation may be more apparent than real. These
are generally characterised as 'sensitive' products.'
The protective instruments used by the EC are all too familiar: tariff
quotas, import ceilings, 'voluntary' restraints and anti-dumping procedures.
The six main sensitive manufacturing sectors are: processed foods, textiles,
clothing, footwear, steel and chemicals.
Free access to agricultural produce would not be possible without
dismantling the Common Agricultural Policy - good sense we cannot expect.
The characteristic instrument of the CAP is the variable import levy
designed to achieve a target level of EC farm-gate prices. The main form of
concession to non-member countries would normally be a levy-free quota. A
more radical solution, short of abolishing CAP, would be actual membership
of the Community for the central Europeans, which still remains an
aspiration without a timetable.
Rollo and Smith attempt to measure the effects of extensive liberalisation
on EC producers and consumers. The loss to EC farm producers is put at 3 per
cent of total revenue spread over a period. This is much less than the falls
in real farm prices between 1985 and 1991 and very much less than the cuts
under CAP reform negotiated in conjunction with the Uruguay Round of trade
liberalisation talks. The effects will be most severe in Greece, Ireland and
certain regions of Italy and France. The authors estimate that the gains to
consumers and taxpayers in the EC from lower agricultural prices will be
sufficient to compensate the farmers who lose and still leave Community
consumers and taxpayers better off. The same would be true in manufactures,
although the size of producers' losses would be less.
What could happen without liberalisation was outlined by Hans-Werner Sinn,
of Munich University, in the same issue of Economic Policy. He did not
believe that the patience of former communist countries was infinite. If
they did not enter a self-sustained growth process in the next few years,
new nationalist movements might gain power, which would revert to
centralised decisions or even dictatorship. This would be the end of the
reform process. Western Europe would again be forced to increase its
military spending, borders would be closed and the cold war would return.
'This would create huge welfare losses for the west which dwarf the
temporary difficulties of some sensitive sectors.'
Signs that central European politicians were indeed running out of patience
were evident at a conference in Copenhagen in April between ministers of the
EC and some former communist countries. The atmosphere was not improved by
an EC temporary ban on meat and dairy products from that region because of
foot-and-mouth disease.
The Czech foreign minister, Mr Pavel Bratinka, noted that there had been no
foot-and-mouth disease in his country since 1974. He added: 'From now on,
the almost automatic support given hitherto by the Czech republic to
anything bearing the label EC will exist no more.'
There were several cases of foot-in-mouth from the Community side. The new
French minister for European affairs, Alain Lamassoure, pleaded for greater
commercial integration in the east to teach la vie communautaire. He thought
it an absurd paradox that eastern Europeans were demanding free trade with
the west while maintaining barriers with their neighbours. He received a
prompt answer from the forthright Hungarian foreign minister, Geza
Jeszenszky, who said: 'East-west trade is simply superior to east-east
trade.'
Hungary, Poland and the former Czechoslovakia have indeed launched the
Visegrad project, which involves mutual free trade over 10 years. But
western attempts to get them to include more former communist countries in
the arrangement as an alternative to turning west are misguided.
Why this is so is well explained in another publication, this time by Daniel
Gros and Alfred Steinherr (Redesigning Economic Geography After the Fall of
the Soviet Empire, Centre for European Policy Studies, Brussels). The
authors show that the normal development of trade is between rich countries
with large amounts of capital relative to labour, and less developed
countries with less capital. At this stage, there is little trade between
countries with similar capital and labour endowments. That comes later when
countries are developed enough to specialise in the industrial goods
exchanged among the rich.
The authors illustrate the point with the example of the Baltic states.
Until recently more than 80 per cent of the total trade of the Baltic
countries was with the former Soviet Union. On the other hand, Finland,
which is in a very similar position, conducted only about 11 per cent of its
trade with the former Soviet Union and 45 per cent with the Community. The
reason, of course, was that the Baltic states had no choice while Finland
could mostly follow its commercial advantage. The inference is that left to
themselves, the Baltic states will want to switch the bulk of their trade
towards western Europe.
The two Brussels authors make a strong plea for a wider free trade area,
including not only central and eastern Europe but most of the former Soviet
Union. This should surely be the next project after the Maastricht treaty is
out of the way. This need not prevent those European countries that are
ready from going full-speed ahead towards monetary union. But they need an
economic framework not provided by Maastricht for a much bigger new single
market covering most of Europe, and a looser political framework in which
subsidiarity would be more than a word.

Sir, your edition of April 27 shows the first green shoots of recovery.
To many professionals such as myself, involved in insolvency, your Tuesday
edition's obituary column of businesses for sale by receivers or liquidators
is a reliable barometer of the state of the economy. Today's edition,
however, has only one such business for sale - a clear sign that things are
picking up.

<TEXT>
Sir, We are now officially out of the recession say Prime Minister John
Major and Chancellor Norman Lamont, and the British people are expected to
be grateful for this achievement of their government.
Do they expect congratulations? When is this government going to give
credit, never mind congratulations, to all those entrepreneurs and business
people who have given their all and lost everything thanks to their
policies.
This is just about the final insult. Will they ever acknowledge the
suffering they have caused to small and medium-sized businesses, to the
hardworking and honest people who are now bankrupt because they have tried
and failed?
They expect to be hailed as heroes but the failed businessmen and
businesswomen are treated as criminals for their efforts.
I hope, but do not believe, that the 'green shoots of recovery' are
appearing. Many businesses are still going down, thousands are losing their
jobs, more people than ever are being made bankrupt; calls for support and
advice to our association are still increasing alarmingly.

FT  29 APR 93 / Letter: Parties must plan for a general election in autumn
of 1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JEFF ROOKER MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Joe Rogaly's perception of the political timetable ('Major reaches dry
land', April 27) is very possible. Any government or opposition which is not
working to an autumn 1995 timetable for a general election is not a serious
contender for power.
The average span between general elections is well under four years. Autumn
1995 is three and a half years from the last one. The special act of
parliament which was rushed through after the last general election ensures
that the new parliamentary boundaries will all be in place by December 1994.
We cannot ignore the fact that the next EC intergovernmental conference is
due in mid-1996.
Given the close shave in 1992 the government will not want to wait until
1997. If this is a widespread assumption, then it would mean that on January
1 1996 everyone would know it was general election year. As such, the
advantage to the incumbent of fixing the date is lost. It makes autumn 1995
as a planning date too seductive to ignore.
There is a further impetus to this timetable. All the opposition parties
will have to have policies locked in place by the policy-making conferences
in autumn 1994 for an autumn 1995 election. As the Conservative party does
not have policy-making conferences, this forces the opposing forces to
declare their hands well in advance.
Is it any wonder that Labour's Plant commission is recommending fixed-term
parliaments?

Before 'You are what you eat' there was 'You eat what you are.' The 1972
Andes plane crash brought cannibalism, man's oldest form of nouvelle
cuisine, into everyone's sitting-room. Consuming your own kind turned from
taboo to talking point; Piers Paul Read's book Alive became a survivalist's
guide to anthropophagy; and now the film pours God all over the debate,
suggesting that the diet of the 20-odd Uruguayans who crash-landed in an
aircraft while flying over snow-topped crags to a rugger match in Chile was
a Communion ritual in a world large with divinity.
'It's magnificent] It's God]' cries Nando (Ethan Hawke) from the final
mountain peak of his trek to find rescue. God stalks the dialogue and
imagery. And we begin with John Malkovich in stubble-bearded close-up as an
ageing Andes survivor, purring thoughts of God into camera.
We do not need all this nudging to see the miraculous in the story. The
group's young saviour, Nando Parrado, came back almost literally from the
dead. (He was counted among the corpses immediately after the crash). And
what better argument to persuade Catholics to eat meat sliced from their
dead friends than to invoke the cannibalistic implications of Communion
itself.
Alive the movie is thrilling whenever it allows the miraculous to breathe
freely and does not strap it to a symbolist life-support machine. The crash
itself may be the best ever filmed. You clutch your cinema seat while a
crunching, booming soundtrack spins your stomach and the screen is a chaos
of screaming bodies, snapping wings, and passenger seats (plus passengers)
sucked through the gaping hole where the tail once was.
Other visceral moments cling to the memory. An avalanche, complete with
ear-splitting rumble and a high-speed tracking-shot that thunders us into
the broken plane to overpower the survivors. (Is this the first
snow-viewpoint shot in history?) And the camera's final, moving,
preposterously inspirational swoop from icy crags to green valley as the
team's rescue-trekkers sight salvation.
The film itself has lows as well as highs. That Alive the movie would be a
play-off between ripping yarn and religious fable we suspected. Co-produced
by Disney, its quest for the family audience requires that the eating of
human flesh is made to seem decent and even sanctified. Delicate scoops from
a frozen buttock yield something resembling smoked turkey slices - even I
would eat them - and no other body part is touched. The real survivors, we
know, ate everything, including stewed-up brains, organs and intestines.
With the lies of omission go lies of commission. Characters hanging off
sheer cliff-edges and indulging in death-defying toboggan rides I do not
remember from the book. Perhaps their Boy's Own hyperbolism testifies to
director Frank Marshall's previous history as a producer/second-unit
director for Master Steven Spielberg.
Yet the greatness of the story itself keeps jumping up to trounce the
trivial. With Marshall's young actors as good as their near-impossible
challenge allows (too many characters for any one to be sculpted in depth),
the ragged splendour of their ordeal finally becomes as elemental,
all-conquering and ugly-beautiful as the landscape around them. We begin by
regretting the injections of God and the shortfalls in realism. (No mistings
of breath in supposedly sub-zero climes; no sense of vast acoustical space
round the post-dubbed voices). We stammer brief protests at the cliffhanging
hokum. But by the end the game of resistance is up. Alive has come alive
with the sound of a great human story slowly condensing into a great human
myth.
*****
Charles Dickens left his last novel, The Mystery Of Edwin Drood, unfinished
at his death. Enter posterity, bearing sackfuls of surmise. For 120 years
the Drood-sleuths have tried to piece together the evidence. Young Edwin -
was he murdered? His opium-crazed, jealous-in-love uncle Mr Jasper - did he
do it? And what of Durdles and Crisparkle and Grewgious - who knows to what
madness men can be driven by the burden of bearing wacky Dickensian names?
Writer-director Timothy Forder knows all about wacky names as creator of the
TV cartoon series Murun Buchstansangur. His film of Drood is the work of an
animator fallen on live action. Actors, being less easily ordered about than
sketches, can look helplessly two-dimensional if given the wrong carrots and
sticks.
Here Robert Powell's gaunt-necked Mr Jasper (a Carrot refugee on a stick),
Glyn Houston's one-note, high-coloured Grewgious (looking as if someone
should loosen his shirt collar), Jonathan Phillips's Drood (just a pretty
face), Andrew Sachs's Durdles (not even that) somnambulate through the dim
lighting, tension-free screenplay and mise-en-scene as wooden as the
duty-Dickensian exposed timbers. Where are the Gothic frissons? Where the
bleak, black sense of a Victorian era riddled with disguise and
double-standard?
In this wet squib of a film, I most enjoyed Freddie Jones as Mayor Sapsea:
an un-dampenable actor here yawing and hamming as if no one has told him
that the style du jour is plainspun recitative rather than Droodian grand
guignol.
Gabriele Salvatore's Mediterraneo won last year's Best Foreign Film Oscar:
an honour traditionally conferred on movies whose plot and concept are
simple enough for Academy members to grasp with one side of their brain
while the other explodes under the unfamiliar impact of subtitles.
Here are eight Italian soldiers stranded on a Greek island in the second
world war. Helped by a broken radio and a bomb-destroyed battleship, they
unwind into hedonism as the years pass. They form relationships with the
local women and donkeys. The leader paints frescoes in the church. The
squad's shy youngster falls in love with the village prostitute. In short
they go native. When 'rescue' finally comes, it is in the shape of what seem
to be the same short-trousered British Naval personnel who rescued the
children in Lord Of The Flies.
It is charming, but is it art? In a year that saw authentically
mind-stretching 'foreign' films by Zhang Yimou, Chen Kaige, Jacques Rivette,
Bertrand Tavernier, this gentle, photogenic, all-human-life yarn could be an
NC Hunter play transplanted to package-hols land. But then in a Hollywood
Academician's life perhaps a little is as good as a feast.
Anything would be a feast compared with Ruby Cairo. Miss Andie McDowell is
going around the world piecing together clues that may lead to the
rediscovery of her 'dead' husband (Viggo Mortensen), an international
smuggler. But why are we the audience following her? It cannot be for
suspense - there is none. It cannot be for comedy - nobody is laughing. And
if it is for romance - Miss McDowell meets charity worker Liam Neeson on a
wharf and then keeps re-meeting him - why do we need that other
husband-hunting plot at all?
Short answer: we don't. Long answer: director Graeme Clifford (Frances),
writer Robert Dillon (Muscle Beach Party) and Miss McDowell (nothing
interesting since sex, lies and videotape) had time on their hands in
not-too-busy careers and thought they might knock off all available genres
in one movie.
Last and least, National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1. Here the Lampoon gang,
seizing and asset-stripping the Lethal Weapon series, add a '1' as if urging
everyone to salivate at the thought of more. Most of us, after 80 minutes of
this, will be crying out for less. Emilio Estevez and Samuel L. Jackson are
the white cop/black cop heroes; there is many a stalled or tailspinning
Airplane-ish gag; and writer-director Gene Quintano is trampled underfoot as
the guest stars (William Shatner, Charlie Sheen, sexologist Dr Joyce
Brothers, Uncle Tom Cobbley) try to leave the plane by the emergency doors.

FT  29 APR 93 / Arts: A thrilling clash of poets - London Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What happens when two artists enter each other's orbit? Total Eclipse,
Christopher Hampton's play about Rimbaud and Verlaine, is now 25 years old,
and it stands up well. As a narrative of what happens when an older and more
formally conventional artist is confronted by a young genius, it is a lot
less windy and ranting than Peter Shaffer's Amadeus. And it is also the
story of an infatuation. The two poets prey upon each other; and Verlaine is
reduced to pleading, bullying and even attempting to shoot Rimbaud. As a
study of destructive passion, Hampton's play makes us set these two
late-19th-century French poets alongside Antony and Cleopatra (Dryden's more
than Shakespeare's), and Don Jose and Carmen. It is much too narrow to be a
great play, but it rivets attention and illuminates the past.
This Greenwich staging works powerfully, thanks to the central performances
of Greg Hicks as Verlaine and 19-year-old Oliver Milburn as Rimbaud.
Milburn, in his first professional stage performance, has complete assurance
and absorption in the world onstage; you often watch him when he is not
speaking. He has Rimbaud's fixity of purpose - whether fixed on Verlaine or
on expressing his own vision - and he is completely natural in the tricky
long speeches in which Rimbaud communicates his poetic ambition. His is not
a performance of virtuoso technique - in particular, he has much to learn
about vocal projection  - but I congratulate the director, Lisa Forrell, for
casting him. He has such obvious talent, and is so plainly right for this
role (the play shows Rimbaud between the ages of 16 and 20), that you want
to see him in a quick succession of precocious young rebel roles.
Greg Hicks has the theatrical experience and wisdom to make Verlaine a
completely different order of being from Milburn's Rimbaud: weaker, but more
complex and more articulate. He catches not only Verlaine's cowardice but
also his anguished awareness of it; and not just his bisexual dilemma
(caught between gorgeous wife and thrilling boy-wonder) but also the raging
despair that underlies his whole life. Whether in the very funny, bizarre
long speech about the foetuses of his three siblings, or in the hysteria
with which he tries to keep Rimbaud, he is compelling. Only in the solo
passages that start and close the play is he too restrained and contrived.
Julian McGowan's designs economically convey a succession of different
scenes beneath a vast wild grey abstract and an unmoving row of empty
absinthe bottles. The heart of Lisa Forrell's staging, properly, is in the
natural force generated by the two poets.
At the Greenwich Theatre, until May 29.

FT  29 APR 93 / Arts: ENO's new team launches season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The incoming artistic team of English National Opera - general director
Dennis Marks, music director Sian Edwards - launched on Monday the 1993-4
season, the first such programme to be presented under their leadership,
writes Max Loppert.
According to Marks, they did so in a spirit of 'confidence and adventure',
and in spite of the Pounds 2 million deficit likely to be inherited as a
result of this season's box-office slump. Seat prices will almost all be
held to current levels (with new plans for half-price tickets for children).
The choice of new productions, seven in all, has been made with the purpose
of inaugurating what Marks calls a 'period of renewal'. Repertory favourites
 -La Boheme, Der Rosenkavalier, Cosi fan tutte - account for three of these;
the others are Lohengrin (the first Wagner at the Coliseum for eight years),
Smetana's Two Widows, Janacek's Jenufa, and the world premiere of Judith
Weir's Blond Eckbert.
Der Rosenkavalier will mark the return to the house of Jonathan Miller as
producer, and Anne Evans (Marschallin) and John Tomlinson (Ochs) among the
cast. There will be revivals of Simon Boccanegra - which opens the season on
August 26 - Weill's Street Scene, Britten's Lucretia and Grimes, Barber of
Seville, Figaro, Fledermaus, Xerxes, Falstaff, Pearl Fishers and Onegin.
Conductors for the season include two Russian ENO debutants, Yakov Kreizberg
and Alexander Polianichko, Andrew Litton, Mark Elder, David Atherton and
Edwards herself.

FT  29 APR 93 / Arts: Gala performance of Love in the Country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There will be a gala performance of Love in the Country, with music by
Anthony Bowles, at the Duke of York's theatre in St Martin's Lane, London,
on Sunday May 2. Meanwhile, the show is having a try-out at the Almeida in
Islington until Saturday, writes Malcolm Rutherford.
Bowles was the musical director of many West End successes including Evita
and Irma la Douce. He died in March before the development of his prime work
was completed. Love in the Country was first performed at LAMDA in 1970 when
Bowles was a teacher there. The story is loosely based on Daphnis and Chloe
in the Isle of Lesbos. The book is in rhymed couplets and, like the lyrics,
written by Mike Alfreds, his long-time collaborator. Most of that is
surprisingly weak. The music, however, is pretty and clever throughout. In
the last 20 minutes the show takes off in a glorious display of wit. If the
Almeida performances can be treated as extended rehearsals, there may be
something to look forward to at the Duke of York's.

FT  29 APR 93 / Arts: Stretching the possible - London Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has taken a decade for London to be given a second performance of Robin
Holloway's Second Concerto for Orchestra, Op. 40 - the first, which itself
came three long years after the Glasgow premiere in 1979, was at the 1982
Proms. There are no doubt hard practical reasons why our orchestras have
from the first steered clear of this huge (40-minute-long), simply
astonishing piece of sustained compositional virtuosity - for a start
because it is hair-raisingly difficult to put together, play and rehearse.
But they provide no real excuse: the work needs to have seeped into
orchestral consciousness, extending players' and listeners' range of the
possible, stretching their and our sense of 20th-century musical fantasy as,
given half a chance, it undoubtedly would. Never mind: Monday's performance
at the Royal Festival Hall by the BBC Symphony under Oliver Knussen -
dedicatee of the Second Concerto - was on all counts a triumphant revival,
solving difficulty after technical difficulty with exactly the combination
of formidable exactitude and insouciant wit the music requires.
The main point about this concerto for orchestra was proved beyond argument:
that it is at once a three-movement showpiece in the honourable Bartok
tradition, concerned to make a brilliant showing of every orchestral
department, and a kind of 'music-drama for orchestra' boldly exploring
little-charted expressive territories - among them, a film-like lapping of
wave upon wave of musical imagery on the shore of a structure itself only
gradually revealed.
Influences abound (Wagner, Strauss, Debussy, Ravel, Stravinsky etc); madcap
snatches of the Chopin Barcarolle and 'Arrivederci Roma' continually flit
across the musical screen; a 'continuo' group of north African-style
percussion disciplines the content with its special fierce glitter.
Eventually, a transition built up of freely notated solo cadenzas arrives to
provide a Dawn Chorus to all the earlier dream-outpourings; this gives way
to a finale firmly pulled together to show that Holloway's allusive,
kaleidoscopic style, far from being promiscuously unleashed or loose in
purpose, has from the first been unified, and capable of exhilarating
resolution.
In addition to dazzling every ear with Holloway, Knussen and the BBC had
already put us permanently in their debt with the London premiere of Aaron
Copland's 1922 ballet Grohg, an early score long lost and only recently
rediscovered, packed with wonderful inventions to be mined in all the more
famous Copland achievements - and a badly-needed re-examination of the
toughly trenchant Inscape (1967), his last significant piece.

FT  29 APR 93 / Arts: Small-scale Swiss attractions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The English Chamber Orchestra's attractive Swiss programme on Monday failed
by a long way to attract the audience it deserved. One hoped that the Swiss
music-lovers on hand took no offence. The trouble was, simply, that no big
works coming out of Switzerland (except a very few whole-evening ones -
operas, oratorios - which demand larger forces) have come into the
international repertoire. Many people have heard and enjoyed a little
Honegger, and maybe Frank Martin's Petite Symphonie Concertante, and just
possibly something by Othmar Schoeck; but a concert devoted to those three
composers will not pull a crowd.
And certainly not at Barbican prices, when its natural home would be the
smaller, thriftier Queen Elizabeth Hall. In fact Martin's PSC was the
opening piece here, and very well played too. It exercised its familiar,
slightly clammy grip, with a hint of inexorable mechanism. Howard Griffiths
has already spent a dozen years conducting in Switzerland and his soloists
on piano, harp and harpsichord were the faithful Yonty Solomon, Thelma Owen
and Ian Watson, balanced with excellent clarity.
Martin's sound-world has a quite particular glint, and his pattern-building
a severe hieratic air. It really is time that we had a full-scale production
of his fine, dark Shakespeare opera on The Tempest. Honegger's highly
conscious constructions reveal a formal sensibility much like his, though
Honegger liked pithier, more resiny sounds.
Thus his war-time Second Symphony for strings, which ended the concert: a
neat, modestly original ground-plan, with a doomy central passacaglia and a
trumpet ('optional') to brighten its final chorale. As often in Honegger,
that seems a kind of backtracking to public piety - Protestant at heart,
surely, despite his still-popular Jeanne d'Arc au bucher - by way of
solemnly joining hands. The trumpet was admirable; the racing strings might
have enjoyed one more rehearsal.
For many listeners, Schoeck's early Violin Concerto will have been the
discovery of the evening. Plainly it occupies youthful, dewy Richard Strauss
territory, with little harmonic tweaks where later Schoeck grew into ripe
expressive complications; but the solo part is eager and songful. Lydia
Mordkovich delivered it with vital enthusiasm. There was also a surprise
bonbon in the 58-year-old Rolf Urs Ringger's 'con slancio', a five-minute
piece of honest, almost up-to-date engineering with vibes and much knitting
of short phrases. It generated some brief, effective splashes, but no
continuing ripples.

Would you rather know the 'true story' of life in suburban Australia or the
'true story' of a New York paparazzo? Sylvania Waters is telling us the true
story of what happens when you put a documentary film crew into a family
home, an idea which Paul Watson tried with the Wilkins in Reading 20 years
ago. He pinched the idea from 'An American Family', a US series made in
1972. Now he has another go with the Baker-Donaher family in Sydney. As with
some members, at least, of the Wilkins family, some of the Australian family
also regret that they ever agreed. In today's episode it is Christmas and
Laurie and Noeline bickering as usual. Pregnant Dione has broken her foot
and Michael is away in Europe playing rugby (9.35 BBC1).
'Blast 'Em]' is a 90-minute documentary in Channel 4's True Stories slot
which follows Victor Malafronte, a young American photographer who earns a
living snatching shots of 'celebrities' such as Madonna, Michael J. Fox and
John Kennedy Jr. One big exclusive can set you up for life, so Malafronte
does not pull his punches.

FT  29 APR 93 / Technology: Sneezes in season - There is a low count for hay
fever remedies, writes Paul Abrahams in a series on drug discoveries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEX causes hay fever. It is the amorous activities of plants that represent
the primary culprit for hay fever sufferers' seasonal snuffles and sneezes.
And the peak period in the northern hemisphere is fast approaching.
Hay fever, known medically as allergic rhinitis, affects anywhere between 10
per cent and 25 per cent of people. And its incidence seems to be growing.
In Switzerland, the proportion of the urban population suffering rose from 1
per cent in 1926 to 5 per cent in 1958 and 10 per cent in 1986. In Sweden
and the UK the number of cases doubled between the early 1970s and the early
1980s. And in Japan the malady was almost unknown before the 1950s but now
affects about 10 per cent of the population.
Admittedly, some of the increase is probably due to the public's greater
awareness of allergies, as well as more accurate diagnosis and a growing
tendency for people to consult doctors. However, epidemiologists are
convinced there has been a real rise in hay fever incidence.
The world market for allergy treatment and prevention was worth about
Dollars 6.6bn (Pounds 4.3bn) last year and is set to rise to Dollars 10.8bn
by 1997, according to Market Intelligence Research Corporation, the market
research group. These figures, also covering asthma which MIRC defines as an
allergy, include antihistamines and combinations of antihistamines,
decongestants, nasal corticosteroids, topical corticosteroids and ophthalmic
anti-allergy agents.
None of the existing treatments helps all patients, however. Given the
millions of hay fever and perennial rhinitis sufferers, there is
surprisingly little research in the area.
The symptoms range from a few sneezes on a summer afternoon to persistent
nasal blockage, loss of smell, headaches, running eyes and throat
irritation. The illness can even trigger asthma attacks. Hay fever is caused
by pollen entering the nose. Given the tiny size of pollen grains - less
than a thousandth of a millimetre in diameter - the havoc they cause is
surprising.
Pollen grains are an integral part of plants' sex lives. Normally, when a
grain lands on a plant's stigma, or female receptacle, it absorbs water,
cracking a fatty layer on the outside of the grain and allowing its proteins
to escape. Enzymes aimed at helping the proteins penetrate and fertilise the
stigma are also released simultaneously.
Unfortunately, pollen is not particularly intelligent. Unable to distinguish
a human nose from a stigma, it releases its chemicals in the nostrils.
The chemicals released are harmless and in most people have no effect.
However, hay fever sufferers do not have a mechanism for identifying them as
benign. Just as asthmatics have hyper-reactive airways, so hay fever
sufferers have hyper-reactive noses. Their immune system views their arrival
as aggressive behaviour and overreacts to the harmless pollen.
In hay fever sufferers, antibodies called Immunoglobulin E, or IgE, lock on
to the pollen. The IgE triggers a reaction in cells called mast cells which
then release mediators. These powerful chemicals, which include histamines,
leukotrienes and bradykinins, are designed to help the body resist
infection. They do this in three ways:
First, they increase the size of even the smallest vessels so that immune
cells can pass in and out more easily, to attack the infection. This creates
the inflammation associated with allergies.
Second, they act as distress signals, calling in more immune cells to the
scene of infection.
Finally, they trigger the creation of mucus in neighbouring cells. The mucus
is used to pick up dust and microbes, sweeping them out of the nasal
passages and down the throat. The additional production of mucus is the
cause of hay fever sufferers' streaming noses.
The sufferers' problems are compounded because their bodies also react to
the pollen invasion by producing more mast cells. This means that the
following day when the body comes across additional pollen there are even
more mast cells to create a reaction. For this reason, symptoms can
deteriorate as the pollen season continues.
At least most hay fever sufferers only experience running, itchy and blocked
noses during peak pollen periods. A few suffer from perennial rhinitis,
normally induced by dust-mites. This tiny creature looks like a speck of
dust and is only 0.5mm in size. A badly infected mattress can contain up to
40,000 per gram of dust. Their effect in sufferers' noses is similar to that
of pollen.
The most commonly-used treatments for hay fever are antihistamines. These
chemicals block the receptor with which histamine would normally interact
and so prevent the blood vessels being dilated. First-generation
antihistamines had a tendency to cross the blood-brain barrier and cause
drowsiness.
The most recent generation, called H1 receptor antagonists, is much more
specific in their action and are non-sedating. They include Seldane,
manufactured by Marion Merrell Dow of the US, Hismanal, produced by Janssen,
Johnson &amp; Johnson's pharmaceuticals wing, and Tavist by Sandoz of
Switzerland. Reactine, Pfizer's medicine, was given a safety and efficacy
endorsement by a sub-committee of the US Food and Drug Administration only
this week.
Claritin, Schering-Plough's treatment which was licensed in the US this
month, should win between 20 and 30 per cent of the American market,
according to Robert Luciano, chairman and chief executive. 'Claritin will do
exceedingly well. We already have that share in Europe, and I think we will
exceed it in the US,' he says. Shearson Lehman Brothers estimate
non-sedating antihistamines have worldwide sales of about Dollars 1.4bn a
year.
However, both Seldane and Hismanal have been associated with potentially
serious cardiac complications when taken in overdose. Seldane can also be
dangerous when used with ketoconazole, an anti-fungal, and erythromycin, a
commonly prescribed antibiotic.
Other treatments include steroids such as Glaxo's Beconase which inhibits
the release of mediators. Fisons' Rynacrom, which contains sodium
cromoglycate, has a similar effect.
Despite the low level of hay fever research, scientists continue to look for
new drugs to block the action of the mediators that trigger the
inflammation. Hoechst is looking at bradykinin-antagonists, while Zeneca,
Imperial Chemical Industries' bioscience subsidiary, and Upjohn of the US
are looking at leukotriene-antagonists. Meanwhile, Ciba is working with a
small US biotechnology company, Tanox, on an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody
that would block the action of IgE.
Max Wilhelm at Ciba explains: 'IgE is an important element in triggering the
release of histamines and other chemicals that cause hay fever and asthma.
In theory, if we block the action of IgE, then you should prevent the body
over-reacting to allergen. This is an exciting area, but don't hold your
breath waiting for it - it's some way off.'
Other areas of research include antagonists against platelet-activating
factor, more commonly known as Paf. This substance is a naturally occurring
product of endotheliel cells, neutrophils and other body cells, which are
produced in response to inflammations. The theory is that if you can block
its manufacture, it should reduce the symptoms of the disease. But analysts
Shearson Lehman Brothers do not expect leukotriene-antagonists or
PAF-antagonists to reach the market until the mid-to-late 1990s.
No single therapy is likely to prove effective for all hay fever sufferers,
but together they should eventually provide a wider armoury with which to
tackle the illness. As plants begin another breeding system, new treatments
cannot come a summer too soon for sufferers awaiting another sneezing
season.
The series will continue next month with a look at drugs to treat
Alzheimer's disease.

FT  29 APR 93 / Technology: Relieving tension at the checkout - Research
that could boost health and cut queues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dangers of working at visual display units without suitable, properly
adjusted work surfaces and seating are well documented. Repetitive Strain
Injury (RSI) - a term used loosely to cover disorders of the neck, shoulder
and arm - is no longer an affliction solely of the manual worker.
One group at risk from RSI, but which has received little attention, is
supermarket checkout operators. Constant bending, twisting and lifting of
objects that vary greatly in weight can be hazardous when combined with
high-speed working, sometimes for several hours without a break.
RSI-type problems become inevitable, particularly with the latest electronic
point-of-sale scanning equipment, unless checkout counters and seating are
designed with ergonomic principles in mind. One Canadian study found, for
example, that half of all operators in one area had sought medical help for
carpal tunnel syndrome and other hand disorders.
However, some conditions take years to show themselves because many
supermarket workers are part-time. Some, especially female casual workers
with little employment protection, may simply change jobs or be forced by
their condition to give up work, without appearing in health statistics.
Research just completed by the University of Birmingham, in England, found
that a third of operators questioned had work-related aches and pains, even
before starting work for the day. By the end of their shift, two-thirds
complained of back pain, shoulder and neck discomfort, and wrist and hand
pain.
The research found Germany, France, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway all
had legal guidelines for the design of checkouts, covering counter heights,
scanners, keyboards, cash drawers, chairs and footrests, In the absence of
British standards, the study makes the following recommendations:
The operator, who should have an easily-adjustable chair, should face the
worktop and not be side-on to it. The counter top should be below elbow
height.
There should be sufficient space to get in and out of the checkout, move the
chair and bend to pick items from the floor. There should be enough leg room
under the counter.
Layout of equipment should prevent twisting of the body and the operator
should not have to stretch to reach anything.
A combined scanner and weighing scale should be provided to reduce the
operator's workload.
The input belt should take at least one full trolley of shopping and there
should be at least two bays to collect scanned goods.
The last points are of particular value in cutting down on customer queueing
times, though the research says all improvements in working conditions for
operators are likely to be reflected in increases in productivity. W
Potrafke, a manufacturer of checkout and conveyor belts, based in Leighton
Buzzard, Bedfordshire, which commissioned the research, estimates that, with
proper ergonomic design, productivity could be increased by up to a third.
Ruth Haigh, the Birmingham University ergonomist who worked on the project,
says that if operators are comfortable and not fatigued, or physically or
mentally stressed, 'they can apply their whole attention to the job and work
just as productively for the whole day as in the first hour'. Good checkout
design also cuts sick leave and staff turnover, according to Haigh.
Collaboration with the university's Centre for Applied Gerontology has
produced additional information on checkout design and older workers -
relevant to stores which have courted older part-time employees.
In general, the maximum safe load for workers over the age of 50 to lift is
30 per cent less than for younger workers and that for women is 30 per cent
lower than for men. Changes in body shape that come with age make adjustable
seating and sufficient space within the checkout particularly important.
Reduced mobility may make it more difficult for workers to stretch to reach
things, and grip and vision also deteriorate.

FT  29 APR 93 / People: BT's Romeril departs for Xerox in US
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barry Romeril, BT's group finance director since 1988 and one of the most
powerful men in Britain's telecommunications behemoth, has resigned to take
up the post of chief financial officer at Xerox Corporation in the US.
Romeril, 49, is no stranger to north America. In previous incarnations, as
assistant treasurer of ICI Americas and US chief financial officer for BTR
Inc, he built up several years' experience of American accounting practices.
Yesterday he said he was sorry to be leaving BT but the opportunity at Xerox
was attractive and fitted in with a desire to return to work once more in
the US.
The parting with BT seems entirely amicable. Romeril does not join Xerox
until June 30, and Iain Vallance, BT chairman, yesterday paid him a glowing
tribute. It does, however, leave a significant gap in BT's senior
management; the company said yesterday it had not yet decided on his
replacement.
Romeril, born in Jersey in the Channel Islands and educated at Oxford
University where he read economics, was seen on his appointment to BT as one
of a 'new guard' of young British managers with a reputation for cutting
costs. It was a skill he was to use year after year in improving BT's
profitability.
At Xerox Romeril will become an executive vice president and a member of
chairman Paul Allaire's corporate office. He takes over a post that has been
vacant since 1990 when Stuart Ross became chairman of Xerox Financial
Services. Xerox clearly has need of Romeril's cost-cutting experience; it
pulled out of financial services earlier this year at an estimated cost of
Dollars 3bn.

FT  29 APR 93 / People: Bahl takes over from Foster at Equal Opportunities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Equal Opportunities Commission's new chairman from June 14 will be
Kamlesh Bahl, 36, currently company secretary and manager of legal services
with Data Logic, the computing services company.
Bahl (right) takes over from Joanna Foster (far right), who has done the job
since 1988 and is now off to run the UK's contribution to the United Nations
Year of the Family.
This was the first time the EOC appointment, which is for three years, has
been openly advertised in the national press. The Department of Employment,
which oversees the EOC, says Bahl was appointed from a strong list of over
80 candidates for the job. The post pays just over Pounds 30,000 for three
days a week - for the remainder of the time Bahl will continue at Data
Logic, but as a consultant, rather than in her current role.
The EOC, which has its headquarters in Manchester, has a budget of about
Pounds 5.8m and about 160 staff. The day-to-day running of the organisation
and management matters are handled by the chief executive, Valerie Amos,
while the chairman concentrates on policy issues and tends to present the
EOC's public face.
Bahl is well-versed in equality issues and the workings of committees of the
great and the good; she is a member of the Law Society's council, sits on
its race relations committee, and was the first woman to chair the society's
commerce and industry group. Like many women in the crustier professions,
she has sometimes had to deal with the accusation of being a 'token'
appointee.
Her other activities include being a council member of the National
Association of Health Authorities and Trusts, and sitting on the race
relations minorities advisory committee of the Lord Chancellor's judicial
studies board.
It is also widely believed that Bahl, through Law Society and BBC
connections, is the model for Usha Gupta, the Asian lawyer in the Archers on
Radio 4.
Meanwhile, Joanna Foster, the departing EOC chairman, describes her
five-year tenure as 'an extraordinary experience'. Her immediate priorities
are 'to get fit, to unpack books from last year's house move, and to do what
I have spent much of the past five years expecting everyone else to do - get
a good balance into my life between work and family'.

FT  29 APR 93 / Accountancy Column: Daimler-Benz gears up for a drive on the
freeway - David Waller explains why Germany's biggest industrial group is
bowing to Anglo-American accounting practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS time, said the chief executive of Germany's largest bank at a recent
press conference, for Germany to enter the civilised world.
Mr Hilmar Kopper, head of the Deutsche Bank, was referring to German
companies' accounting practices, and his remarks came shortly after
Daimler-Benz had announced it would be moving from the teutonic version of
accounting to the Anglo-American.
Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial group, which is 28 per cent owned
by the Deutsche Bank, reached agreement with the Securities &amp; Exchange
Commission at the end of March over the broad terms of a listing on the New
York Stock Exchange.
Subject to further, detailed negotiations with the SEC, Daimler is set to
obtain a full listing on Wall Street laster this year. The listing will end
the anomaly that German companies, among the biggest industrial and
financial services groups in Europe, have not had any direct access to the
US equity market, the largest pool of capital in the world.
The reason for this was that German companies refused to submit to the
requirements of the SEC and publish US versions of their accounts.
German accounting differs from Anglo-American in a number of important
areas, not least that it makes no claim to provide a 'true and fair' view of
economic reality.
It is conditioned by tax laws and the requirement to put the interests of
creditors above those of other users of accounts, for example shareholders.
Although recent EC legislation has meant that group accounts have become
more transparent, German accounting is still characterised by conservatism
and a want of pertinent detail.
The differences reflect contrasting styles of capitalism: the Anglo-American
variety where the capital market plays an important role in the economy, and
the Germanic, where there are only 665 listed companies and the stock market
represents far smaller percentage of GDP than in the US or the UK.
But, said Gerhard Liener, Daimler finance director, at the time that the
agreement was sealed with the SEC, 'Anglo-Saxon accounting has become the
language of international business'.
Daimler's decision to 'go it alone' to New York follows the failure of a
joint approach to the SEC by a number of big German companies. The
unilateral step has incurred the wrath of fellow German companies. Mr Helmut
Loehr, finance director of Bayer, one of Germany's big three chemicals
companies, has condemned Daimler for capitulating before the US authorities
and showing a want of traditional German solidarity. Nevertheless, it seems
likely that other big German companies will follow suit once they have had
the opportunity to study the details of the final agreement between Daimler
and the SEC.
Throughout the 1980s, German companies could adopt a high-handed approach to
the world's largest capital market for the simple reason that they did not
need that capital. Recent figures from the Bundesbank show that companies
generated so much cash throughout the decade that they could finance the
bulk of their investments - excluding acquisitions - from internal
resources.
But as Ronaldo Schmitz, board director of the Deutsche Bank responsible for
corporate finance, explained to a conference of institutional investors in
Dusseldorf, this is set to change as Germany industry's cash needs grow
substantially in the more difficult economic environment of the 1990s.
Bank lending, the traditional source of finance, will not be adequate,
requiring German companies to turn increasingly to equity markets.
'During the most significant industrial reconstruction since the war, the
cost of capital will gain importance as a competitive factor,' Mr Schmitz
said. 'Throughout the next decade there will not be an abundance of capital
as wealth will be soaked up by government deficits. German industry will
have to change its attitude to shareholders if it is to attract that
capital.'
Foreign investors, predominantly institutions, own between 40 and 50 per
cent of the 'free float' in German companies shares. But their interests
have traditionally been neglected in favour of the banks, insurance
companies and other corporate shareholders which control the German stock
market and have other priorities than short or even medium-term investment
performance.
One of the ways in which the international investment community is
ill-served is in the quality of accounting information.
'The lack of visibility of company prospects is a serious constraint on
inward investment in the German market,' said Tracey Campbell, manager of
Fidelity Investment's Germany Fund on a visit to Frankfurt last month,
'despite Germany being the largest economy in Europe.
'The poor quality of financial information available from many German
companies makes it difficult for investors to buy a stock with confidence
since valuations cannot be clearly established . . . Few companies give any
indication of divisional profits breakdown at the kind of level which would
allow the investor to track margins over time and make comparisons across
companies.'
Takeover protection devices - in place at many large companies - represent
another obstacle to flows of institutional investment into Germany. It is no
coincidence that Daimler, within days of announcing its move to
investor-friendly accounting, announced it would also be getting rid of its
own anti-takeover device.
Daimler said it planned to dissolve Mercedes Automobil Holding (MAH), a
company which has no purpose but to hold a 25.23 per cent stake in Daimler
and serve as a block to unfriendly takeovers. Set up in 1977 to prevent the
Shah of Iran buying up the crown jewels of German industry, MAH has no
connection with Daimler's Mercedes-Benz automobile business.
These two moves are connected with Daimler's plans to hold a large rights
issue next year. It was forced to abandon a DM2bn issue planned for the
German market last autumn because of poor market conditions (and poor
operating performance).
Future capital raising will be made easier, not least because 1993 reported
profits and equity capital will be sharply higher under US Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles than under German rules. Obviously this
reflects no real fundamental change in 'economic reality' - but the US
version of the figures is likely to make the shares look more palatable to
international investors.
It still has to be decided how Daimler will deal with a number of tricky
issues, for example the write-back of provisions or of DM4bn of goodwill
which arose on a spate of acquisitions in the late 1980s and which was
written off against equity.
But Michael Geiger at NatWest Securities in London believes that current
year group profits will benefit from a one-off write back of provisions of
up to DM2.5 - 3bn, three times the group's expected net profit of about
DM1bn. Equity will be bolstered by up to 20 per cent, Geiger calculates.
Just as important as the impact on reported profits are the longer-term
cultural changes which are likely to be induced by greater accounting
transparency - for example 'segmental' reporting by operating division and a
US-style cash-flow statement.
Daimler will have to publish more financial information, more often than
before, putting pressure on the management of the German company to deliver
the financial performance required by the Anglo-American investment
community.

FT  29 APR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Playing the big boys
at their own game - Tomy's tilt at Sega and Nintendo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two words dominated the Christmas shopping baskets of parents across the
developed world last year - Sega and Nintendo. Tomy, another Japanese toy
maker, hopes to join them this year.
A share of the electronic games pie would be worth having. The Economist
Intelligence Unit says the total retail value of electronic games in 1992 -
the overwhelming majority of the market taken by Sega and Nintendo - was
Pounds 755m in the UK alone, having grown from only Pounds 100m in 1990.
Worldwide, the figure is probably closer to Pounds 10bn and growing fast.
The EIU believes the 'present generation of electronic toys has a good two
years of growth left'.
Much of the market explosion has come from the two giants' clever use of one
of the oldest marketing tricks in the book - get the kids to squeal loud
enough.
In 1992 Sega and Nintendo made clever use of hi-tech TV advertising and
sponsorship deals, as well as carefully targeting kid-oriented media slots,
all with one aim; make every child want what he or she thought every other
child already had. That effort will be repeated this year.
Such intense marketing led to bush-fire popularity in the playground, but
Sega and Nintendo's astonishing recent growth may be unsustainable. So they
are using other means to keep the ball rolling. A battery of legal defences
 -against smaller, competing software producers - and technological
innovations - CD and eventually virtual reality games - are other tools each
uses to fend off competition from the other and from smaller companies.
Tomy, which launches its hand-held electronic game, Barcode Battler, in the
UK at the end of May, is one such new entrant to the electronic game market.
Such is the entrenched position of Sega and Nintendo - together they sold
more than 1m hand-held games in the UK in 1992 - that Tomy faces an uphill
battle.
Tomy's methods of trying to steal market share are a combination of the
clever and the unusual.
The unusual is that Tomy UK - covering other European markets - has no
advertising agency, but instead uses a single consultant to generate the
creative ideas for its ad campaigns. Once the ad is made, Tomy concentrates
its efforts and marketing spend on well-targeted media buying.
Peter Brown, Tomy UK's managing director, estimates that by not using an
advertising agency the company saves about Pounds 500,000 annually. As
important for him is that 'there is no advertising agency imposing its ideas
on us'.
Tomy has a Pounds 750,000 marketing budget for Barcode Battler, its biggest
product launch so far.
The clever element resides to a large extent in the product itself, which
tries to tempt not just kids but also parents and large consumer goods
manufacturers to get involved.
Parent-pull number one is price: Barcode Battler will retail for about
Pounds 40, little more than half the price of a typical Sega/Nintendo
hand-held game.
Moreover, Barcode Battler's software is free, unlike that of Nintendo and
Sega, whose extra games retail at around Pounds 25. Barcode Battler uses
barcodes (found on almost all consumer goods) as the software with which
players stage battles between science-fiction creatures. The game also comes
with a set of cards carrying barcodes which the game scans and then
translates into points giving extra strengths to players.
Parent-pull number two is game content: unlike most electronic games
currently available, Barcode Battler requires the players to use addition
and subtraction to work out the relative strengths of the combatants. (One
turn-off for children might be that there are no visual characters; instead
the player sees a numeric display and the 'battles' are fought in purely
arithmetical terms.)
Tomy can thus claim that Barcode Battler provides both fun and educational
activities - something that the best public relations efforts of Sega and
Nintendo have failed to do.
Whether kids will find Barcode Battler as appealing as the high-definition
visuals of competing games is another question. But to some extent an answer
is already available. Barcode Battler has already scored well in Japan,
where Tomy - which has worldwide turnover of Pounds 500m - sold more than
1.2m units in the year since launch, 800,000 of those in the last six
months.
In Japan the Barcode Battler has developed its own image - children have
discovered that some products' barcodes have much higher values in the game
than others. 'But it is not really practical for the consumer to establish
the strength of the barcode other than by scanning it through the game,'
says Brown.
What are prospects for UK sales? 'Our sales team has come up with a forecast
of up to 300,000 units, and that would represent about Pounds 7m of
turnover, out of the UK figure of Pounds 60m,' he says.
But estimating UK demand for Barcode Battler, particularly for the two-month
run-up to Christmas, causes headaches. 'It's made in Hong Kong. It takes a
month on the water and the production lead time is three months, so there is
a four-month gap. The last shipment dates we can make are at the end of
November. For Christmas, we have to make a decision early, and we tend to
err on the conservative side,' Brown adds.
Tomy UK has seen failures in the past. 'Five years ago we had a product
called RATS, which stood for Robot Anti-Terrorist Squad,' says Brown. 'We
had a wonderful television commercial, everything was in place, but the kids
didn't want it. You can increase your advertising and so on but now we try
to keep close contact with electronic point-of-sale data to see what's going
on. You can over-advertise to kids, they get suspicious - 'why are they
advertising so much? It can't be any good'.'

FT  29 APR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The clear contender
 -Beer is the latest product to get the transparent treatment in the battle
for US market share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It looks like gin and tonic with a frothy head. It tastes like . . . well,
some sort of a fizzy drink.
This is Clear Beer, a new product which Miller Brewing, the second largest
beer producer in the US and part of the giant Philip Morris group, launched
this month in selected markets.
Consumers in Austin (Texas), Richmond (Virginia) and Minneapolis (Minnesota)
were able to purchase the bottled brew immediately. A 12-ounce can version
will be available next month.
Why, it might be asked, should anyone even contemplate marketing a
colourless ale? The answer is twofold. In part, the new brew is a response
to the large but moribund US beer market where innovation is essential to
sales growth. In part, however, Miller is seeking to capitalise on one of
the hottest US marketing themes: clear products.
The US beer market is - if the term can be excused - flat. Total sales
volume has been static at around 190m barrels for five years and the
brewers' need to grab market share has become paramount.
For years, the motor within the sector has been sales of lower-calorie
'light' beer, to the point where aggregate volume for the three main brands
in this subsector - Miller Lite, Coors Light and Bud Light - topped 40m
barrels in 1992. That was only slightly below the 46.8m barrels of Budweiser
 -the nation's top-selling brew - which disappeared down American throats.
Miller's theory is that the new clear product will offer a 'full beer
flavour', but be perceived as lacking the 'heaviness' which the traditional
amber nectar imparts.
But the beer has the same alcohol content as any ordinary American beer, and
is made from a traditional mix of hops, barley and cereal grains. Yet the
colourless pint delivers a lower carbohydrate count - about half that of a
conventional beer. This, plus the beer's appearance, may persuade drinkers
that it is actually a 'lighter' product.
A little surprisingly, the promotional campaign surrounding the new beverage
is more concerned with persuading consumers that 'clear beer' is really
beer, than with playing up its wholesome image.
'Great beer-drinking beer' is the advertising tagline devised by New York
agency Cliff Freeman - with repetition of the word 'beer' designed to
emphasis the drink's authenticity. Ears of corn are also prominent on the
label design.
Whether drinkers take to Clear Beer only time will tell. But the product's
launch does point up the very discernable marketing trend towards colourless
products in the US which is now beginning to appear in UK.
This is usually viewed as an outcrop of the pro-health, pro-environment
concerns which have been a driving force in the consumer goods sector in the
1990s. According to New Product News, in Chicago, about three dozen clear
products hit the supermarket shelves last year, ranging from mouthwashes to
rubbish bags.
Included in the list are offerings from some of the nation's biggest
consumer goods companies. In December, for example, PepsiCo launched
'Crystal Pepsi', a clear, no-preservative version of the traditional soft
drink. Coca-Cola is retaliating with 'Tab Clear', its own colourless cola.
Meanwhile, in the toiletries area, Gillette has introduced 'Cleargel
deodorant'. Procter &amp; Gamble is making a clear Ivory dishwashing liquid  - a
product which has traditionally been 'milky-cream' - and selling it in
transparent containers. Colgate-Palmolive, a rival detergents manufacturer,
is doing likewise. There is even a clear petrol produced by Amoco. Though
this is not actually a new product, the gasoline has been renamed 'Crystal
Clear Amoco Ultimate' and is being promoted more actively and distributed
more widely.
Many of these products have been on the market for too short a time for any
sensible assessment of their selling power to be made.
Most manufacturers admit that curiosity may be a factor in driving up
post-launch sales, and market research firms such as A C Nielson decline to
supply figures on market share for recently launched products.
That said, there are some early indications that shoppers are proving
responsive. The trade press, for example, has suggested that Crystal Pepsi
may have taken about 2.4 per cent of the large US soft drinks market in the
first few months since its nationwide launch. Pepsi says that figure - if
correct - 'would make us ecstatic'. The company's goal is to have the
product command a 2 per cent market share by the end of this year, which
would equate to sales of more than Dollars 1bn. Pepsi is currently
considering whether to launch the product overseas.
P&amp;G, which replaced its entire Ivory dishwashing liquid line with the new
clear version last summer, also says that both sales and market share have
increased since then, although it declines to give numbers.
But nearly all of these manufacturers are savvy enough to suggest that the
'clearness' of the product is merely a visual means of emphasising
underlying product enhancements.
P&amp;G, for example, claims that the 'colourless' revamp of its dishwashing
liquid accompanied a product reformulation, and that this enhanced Ivory's
'grease-cutting' ability.
Palmolive calls its colourless detergent 'Palmolive Sensitive Skin' - to
stress the additional cosmetic benefits.
Pepsi, meanwhile, notes that Crystal is also a no-preservative, no-caffeine
product. 'Yes, it's a clear product,' says the company, 'but that's just one
of its marketing attributes. Making a clear drink was not our primary aim.'
Clarity, however, does not come cheap. Since these products generally claim
benefits over their traditional counterparts, with lack of colour being used
to emphasise this fact, they tend to cost more. For example, a 22-oz bottle
of Sensitive Skin dishwashing liquid costs Dollars 2.29 in a Manhattan
supermarket, compared with Dollars 2.19 for the traditional version. Virtue,
in short, has its price.

FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Business Schools (11): A growth stock in today's
MBA market - A look at distance learning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISTANCE learning is the growth stock in the MBA market. Cheap, compatible
with full-time work, geared to the middle and junior managers hitherto
cold-shouldered by the business schools, the ultimate in flexibility -
distance learning was a concept waiting to take off.
In the UK it did so in the late 1980s, as a result of three forces:
The advent of the Open Business School (OBS), which lent respectability to
the concept;
A succession of studies earlier in the decade - notably the Harbridge House
Report in 1984 - claiming that in many respects full-time courses offered a
poor return to students and employers alike;
The development of sophisticated inter-active software packages, making it
possible to tackle the 'hard' parts of courses (such as data analysis) in
front of a screen.
The Open Business School is an integral part of the Open University, the
UK's pathfinding institute for post-experience distance-learning courses. It
is about to celebrate its 10th birthday and 100,000th management development
course.
It is Europe's largest business school; this year it will graduate its first
full cohort of 569 MBA students. Another 1,000 will follow next year. The
numbers will rise; within a few years, OBS expects to be graduating one in
five of the UK's new MBAs. The average age for its MBA students is 36 - some
six years older than the typical part- or full-time MBA student elsewhere.
The OBS is a huge operation, requiring more than 1,000 tutors, many of them
practising managers, with regular residential schools and face-to-face
tutorials. Students are expected to buy their own IBM-compatible PCs, but
courses cost a fraction of the going part-time rate.
'Before OBS came on the scene, Henley (Management College) had the market to
itself,' says Mr Roger McCormick, director general of the Association of
MBAs. 'Even when OBS started, its massive first year intake was widely
considered a freak. No-one thinks that now.'
Nor do they under-estimate the OBS's achievement. 'Without doubt, the OBS
has added a new dimension both in numbers and sophistication to the idea of
a distance-learning MBA,' says McCormick.
He emphasises the impact OBS is having on other business schools. First, it
has pushed them to start or improve their distance-learning courses.'
Henley, reinvigorated, is to the fore; so are Warwick and Strathclyde.
Second, OBS is leading other schools to adopt a more modular approach to
existing MBAs, and promote the integration of home-based inter-active
techniques within part- and full-time courses. 'Statistics is a good
example,' says McCormick. 'It is a course easily delivered by inter-active
programmes, and incapacity at maths is something British students and
managers are notoriously reluctant to admit in the classroom.'
The numbers make you dizzy. This year's OBS registration tally is 22,000,
representing some 15,000 students (equivalent to the whole of Oxford
university and more). Until 1991, growth was at 35 per cent a year; it is
slowing down to about 10 per cent - 'as much as we can manage while
safeguarding quality,' says Professor Andrew Thompson, the school's
director.
In fact, it would have declined this year but for the overseas market, which
is growing fast: OBS's aim is to have between 5,000 and 6,000 students in
mainland western Europe by 1996.
The concept apart, the OBS has three particular strengths: the modular
nature of its courses; their international appeal; and their attraction to
the public sector.
OBS's management courses come in three ascending levels: certificate,
diploma and MBA. One leads to the other, though it is not always necessary
to start at the bottom. The certificate and diploma each take a year; the
MBA three years, or two if taken after the diploma.
With over 4,000 management students outside the UK, OBS now has
co-ordinators in every EC country besides Denmark, and in most EFTA states
too.
OBS is one of the few western business schools making large inroads into
central and eastern Europe. In western Europe all teaching material is in
English; further east, it is translated. Hungary and Slovakia each have
1,000 OBS students; the first cohort of 500 started in Russia last year, and
tutors are being trained in Bulgaria and Romania, partly under the Foreign
Office's 'know-how' fund.
A dramatic rise in corporate interest in distance-learning is the biggest
change of the last few years, says Thompson. 'When we started, we were
dealing with individuals; now the dynamic has shifted to companies and other
employers, who want to integrate our courses into their own training
structures.' Leading corporate clients include Abbey National, Whitbread,
Price Waterhouse, Rank Xerox, ICI and BT.
Some 40 open universities exist around the world. Most do management
programmes, but with courses mostly at undergraduate, not graduate level.
OBS has a true global market before it.

FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Business Schools (12): Ambivalence rules in the UK
 -The progress of business ethics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACROSS THE business schools of Britain, small lights illuminating the
presence of classrooms teaching ethics are beginning to glimmer. Their beams
so far remain very faint.
Business ethics is beginning to appear in the curriculum. It has grown from
a strong base in the US into a topic being taken seriously on campuses
elsewhere around the world.
There is now a European Business Ethics Network of academics and
practitioners, and a fledgling journal, counterbalancing the much more
substantial literature being generated in North America.
Recent corporate scandals, not least the fracas between British Airways and
Virgin, have served to highlight the need to take the subject seriously. But
it is ironic that it is the business sector - which has been behaving in
ways ethically questionable - which has begun to address the matter of how
acceptable such behaviour is, and to make amends.
Academia might have been expected to have taken a lead, launching courses
and raising questions in the classroom. In fact, much of the impetus seems
to have come from business. A growing number of companies' annual reports
make references to corporate governance.
An analysis by the Institute of Business Ethics last summer showed that
nearly 30 per cent of large companies have a written ethical code, covering
topics such as relations with employees and customers, and sexual
harassment.
Even in teaching, some companies have seized the initiative by launching
their own internal sessions to consider the subject. For example, Mr John
Drummond of Integrity Works, a London-based consultancy on ethical matters,
has just completed work with National Westminster Bank to develop an ethical
code and a series of associated procedures for the bank in consultation with
its employees.
But perhaps most significantly, the last few months have seen the creation
of no fewer than three academic chairs in the subject, all at the
instigation of companies.
For example, in April 1992 Drake Beam Morin (DBM), the out-placement
consultants, funded a chair in corporate governance at Leeds University, now
occupied by Mr Thomas Clarke. Then the Co-Operative Bank announced the
creation, with its support, of a chair of corporate responsibility at
Manchester Business School, to which Mr Brian Harvey has been appointed.
And Dixons, the electrical retailer, donated Pounds 1m last July to the
London Business School, to establish a chair of business ethics and social
responsibility.
Mr Stanley Kalms, Dixons' chairman, says: 'You started wondering, as you
watched the attitudes being formed in the 1980s, can this be right? There
were too many two-dimensional, cardboard people, worried only about
themselves and acquisitions. Intelligence said this can't be enough.'
He sees the need for serious study of the topic. 'A lot of people reject the
concept of ethics and talk instead about integrity. This is a philistine
approach. I come from the integrity school. But I realised that was just
using words. It's no good taking your own standards of integrity and
assuming everyone in your organisation shares them.'
In spite of these business gestures in the direction of change, the response
from academia remains muted. There is no sign yet of an appointment to the
London Business School post - which partly reflects the lack of suitable
candidates for such a position in the UK.
There is still considerable ambivalence about teaching the subject, let
alone how it should be taught: as an integrated topic or a separate module.
In fact, Mr Kalms says he first offered the money to the economics
department at the London School of Economics - but it rejected the donation,
arguing that such a subject properly belonged in the philosophy department.
That attitude is strongly rejected by the small new breed of business school
ethics faculty. 'It's very important to build the ethical dimensions into
each subject and not isolate with some semi-cleric delivering sermons on the
side,' says Mr Clarke from Leeds.
He says the philosophy department is working with the business school to
develop an MA course in business policy and ethics, designed for 'the
cerebral, reflective manager.'
But he concedes: 'You'd be hard put to find a business ethics course in the
UK at the moment. It's a guest lecture thing. I feel it will move from an
optional extra on MBA courses to part of a corporate responsibility core
subject. We will begin slowly to emulate what's happening in the US.'
He argues that during the 1980s, business schools over-enthusiastically
threw out subjects such as sociology from their curricula. A contrary mood
is only now developing.
One example is at the Cranfield Institute of Technology. Mr Shai Vyakarnam,
a lecturer, says his optional course on ethics in business decisions has
attracted 21 of the school's 160 MBA students this year.
Recognition of the current dearth of courses is widespread, matched only by
a modest optimism for the future. 'Trickle is the right word,' says Mr Rob
Gray, head of the accounting and business finance department at the
University of Dundee. 'But it is the issue of the future.'
Mr Harvey from Manchester Business School says: 'Everybody is nibbling away
at it. My feeling is that they haven't got very far.' (That includes his own
department which, he says, has yet to offer business ethics as an option.)
But he sees demand growing for the topic, with particular interest from
executives in 'how to manage to maintain a grip on the corporate ethos and
brand when you have empowered managers focused on the bottom line.'
Business has clearly thrown down the gauntlet in the courts of academia.

FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Business Schools (9): The aim need not be 'publish
or perish' - High quality business school research may be scarce, but
research is not all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TREAT with caution the dean's blurb about teaching and research being 'top
quality' in his school, with the two going 'hand-in-hand'.
The number of business schools engaging in top-notch research is small; and
frankly, much management education does not require intense research back-up
to make it effective.
In the UK, external assessment and validation of research and teaching is
opening business/management schools to critical self-examination as never
before. The Universities Funding Council's research assessment exercise,
published late last year, divided state-funded institutions into five
categories.
These range between those institutions publishing work of 'international
excellence' (grade 5) and those giving evidence of excellent research in
'none, or virtually none, of the sub areas of activity' (grade 1).
The conclusion: high quality is scarce.
Only seven institutions were rated by the UFC rated at level 5 (see table).
A further four were placed at level 4 ('national excellence' in most areas
of research).
Well-known universities, including Manchester and Cranfield, were among the
71 making it to neither camp. More than a third of the total (31 of of 83)
were consigned to level 1.
Furthermore, since the UFC's assessment is used as the basis for allocating
government funding for research, to those that have . . .
Despite the American 'publish or perish' culture, seasoned observers would
distribute US business schools in roughly similar proportions, with a clear
divide between 'Ivy League' schools on the one hand, and on the other
community colleges and state business schools, most of which have lacklustre
research records.
It is the same on the continent - particularly in Italy and Spain - where
the mushrooming of business schools has not yielded commensurate growth in
research output.
Back in the UK, the 31 institutions rated by the UFC at grade 1 include most
of the former polytechnics. Their business schools mostly date from the
early-to-mid 1980s, when the 'milch cow' attraction of business schools was
at its highest and the discrimination of consumers at its poorest.
It was then, also, that demand for part-time courses exploded, particularly
from middle and junior managers who had previously seen business schools as
being above them.
The new part-time market needed four things above all: proximity, cheapness,
flexibility, and bona fide degrees. Polytechnics were well-placed to provide
all three. Research did not feature on the list; indeed, until last year
polys did not even have access to the UFC research funding.
Professor David Ashton, chairman of the Association of Business Schools and
dean of Lancaster University's School (which gained a grade 5) views this
situation as inevitable. 'It is doubtful whether the country can sustain
more than a dozen or so serious research institutions; the real question is,
should so many universities be devoting themselves to research at all?'
Which begs the further question: how important is research to teaching?
The answer depends upon what is being taught. Profiles, in this survey, of
the management schools of Cranfield Institute of Technology and the London
School of Economics, both universities with high reputations, make the
point.
Cranfield's Professor Leo Murray is 'bothered enormously' by the 'publish or
perish' mentality: 'Highly academic and technical papers may be very clever,
but most of them are fairly useless to the job of management, and so to the
task of the business school, which is highly vocational.'
Murray 'emphasises the 'D' in research and development.' By contrast,
according to Professor Peter Abell of the LSE, management should be seen as
a study growing out of rigorous social science, which is nothing without
heavy duty data analysis and sophisticated explanatory models.
In a sense, both are right. For a tutor planning and teaching a vocational
MBA, hands-on business experience may indeed be more use than tomes to one's
name on chaos theory (Murray, it should be noted, is a former director of
Rothmans and a long time executive); whereas for undergraduate or graduate
courses combining social science and management, theory is almost all (Abell
was professor of sociology at the universities of Surrey and Birmingham
before moving to the LSE).
One type of management course is not inherently better than another; they
are just different. For the unwitting potential student, the important thing
to understand is where institutions are coming from: in particular how their
research traditions (or lack of them) inform the content of their courses
and the style of their teaching. This is particularly important at the
graduate level, where curriculums vary enormously and the predilections of
individual academics count for much.
In the UK, the issue is further complicated by the the debate over the
validation of management courses by the National Council for Vocational
Qualifications.
The council, through its agent the Management Charter Initiative, has been
seeking to impose uniform standards on management courses qualifying for
National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) status at various levels roughly
corresponding to management tiers. MCI's emphasis is on managers
demonstrating competence at carrying out management tasks appropriate to
their level and situation.
The process of setting the standards - which are the benchmarks for
validating courses on the NVQ scale - has been fraught. There has been
protracted argument between MCI and degree and qualification awarding bodies
(both universities and suppliers of qualifications such as the Business and
Technology Education Council).
To the layman, much of the disputation looks to be of the 'angels on a point
of a pin' variety. However, the key issue is clear enough: how far should
management courses, particularly at front-line and middle-manager level, be
testing competences in the workplace, and how far should they be seeking to
test knowledge accumulated through study?
For universities, particularly the former polytechnics serving predominantly
the bottom of the management pyramid, NVQ accreditation for their courses is
critical, because employers and students alike are increasingly demanding
it. 'But', says the head of one such business school, 'there must be a limit
to how far we will prostitute ourselves in pursuit of a fundamentally
mistaken venture. '
Andrew Summers, MCI's chief executive, responds: 'The real source of the
trouble is that NVQs are new. Universities have traditionally based their
assessment on knowledge; in management what matters is what you do with the
knowledge. MCI is anxious that business qualifications show whether or not
you can perform as a manager. For that, you need knowledge, but you need far
more.'
But Summers says he is 'the first to concede' that institutions will neither
want nor need NVQ validation for all their courses, even when MCI's
'management standards' reach senior managers. 'There will always be a role
for two different types of management course: essentially knowledge-based
courses, for which NVQs have no role; and more vocational courses, where
they will. We are not forcing anyone into our mould.'
Perhaps. But many business schools feel that they are in a vice: in order to
to curry favour with the UFC they need to churn out the research; to please
MCI, they have to be glorified training departments. It is time, perhaps,
for their deans to get down those tomes on corporate strategy.

FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Business Schools (10): Boom has given way to a new
caution - Adrian Furnham analyses some noticeable trends in management and
business training in the 1990s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR ALL the impact of recession, training budgets remain large. Companies
and public sector organisations buy in (or have in-house) training
departments, centres and even country castles to run training courses for
their staff.
Courses cover all sorts of topics: induction to the organisation, specific
job-related or 'people' skills (assertiveness, negotiation) and
culture-change developmental workshops aimed at middle or senior management.
But economic downturns mean that training budgets look easy targets for
cuts; products and technical innovations mean training has to respond to
different needs; demographic changes in the internal (employees) and
external (purchasing) customers mean that programmes soon become redundant.
Many training departments also suffer a poor image. They are seen as a
backwater of personnel itself; a refuge for the incompetent.
There are some noticeable trends in management and business training in the
1990s The 1980s boom, with its inevitable heroes and fads, has given way to
a new caution. Different themes have begun to emerge which are likely to
endure. Though not all apparent in all organisations, at least seven themes
may be remarked.
Learning not Training: Training is about acquiring specific skills; learning
is more concerned with general principles. Training is for the here-and-how:
company-specific; highly practical, even pragmatic. Learning has less
immediate application but is designed to be more useful in various contexts.
Companies have preferred training because it is believed to be more cost
effective. Many firms do not believe that their task is to provide a rather
general university-based education. That, they argue, is a luxury which
managers can buy for themselves, but more and more companies see benefit in
the well-educated manager; the intelligent generalist.
Because there is nothing as practical as good theory they send their people
off to acquire an MBA, or on longer developmental courses. The opportunity
for learning (as opposed to training) may actually help staff retention in
these firms, and might even encourage better applicants.
Some companies approach business schools to teach their own client-derived
syllabus, but taught and approved by the university. So the manager gets
organisation-approved education plus a degree.
A less provincial, chauvinistic, ethnocentric perspective: We now have a
global market, an international work-force and multi-national products.
Management has had to take this into consideration. Cosy 'we-they' stories,
case histories from local companies and a homogeneous work-force are things
of the past.
All managers need a wider perspective - not just pan-European, but the
global market. Hence the focus on cultural differences, and comprehensive
briefings on how companies in other countries do things. The 'little
Englander' trainer, like the vulgar American consultant, faces extinction.
Euro-sceptics are not welcome in the training centre. All managers are being
encouraged to be multi-lingual and comfortable in cross-cultural
communication.
Competency-led training: - Despite the vagueness of the concept of
competency, many organisations have been forced to think through exactly
which skills, abilities and traits they require of their managers. Having
done this they are frequently much more focused on what sort of training is
needed.
In the past, trainers provided what was thought appropriate - or, more
prosaically, what they could offer. Now they are being required to integrate
the training programme into the company's overall competence-led training or
human resource strategy.
Courses which do not fit may be jettisoned. Others may have to be created to
meet the needs of the proposed strategy.
In this sense training follows strategy, although competencies are often
defined so vaguely that the trainers can easily adapt what they have to
satisfy their clients in the board room.
Team building rather than leadership: If the 1980s was the 'me' decade and
the 1990s is the 'we' decade, how is this reflected in management training?
Nearly everyone works in groups; business success is, we are told, dependent
not on individual but on teams. It really is true that a chain is only as
strong as its weakest link.
Heterogeneous teams - those with overall ability but whose members each have
different skills, preferences and approaches that complement each other, do
best.
Just as people may have to be trained to become leaders, they may also have
to be trained to be followers. Training programmes now focus on how to
build, sustain and manage a team; how to assess your favourite and most
comfortable role when operating a team; how to select individuals with a
team in mind, and how to be a better team member.
Virtual-reality training: Trainers have always worried about the
'generalisability' of training - that is, whether what you learn on courses
in comfortable hotels or cosy training centres actually gets applied, let
alone remembered, in the real work setting. The more realistic or similar
the training environment to the work environment, the less, by definition,
is there a problem of generalisation.
Airlines spend on simulators. Trainers, too, are now considering training in
situ - on the shop floor, in the executive office or in the sales room.
Though this may cause some inconvenience or even danger to customer or
equipment, it is thought worth it.
Shadowing - observing someone on the job, is becoming more popular and,
supposedly, a useful teaching aid. (This development may be bad news for
hotels making money from chalk-and-talk seminars.)
Using managers as trainers: It is not only because of the expense of
staffing a permanent training department, or calling in egotistical
consultants, that there is a trend for managers to become trainers
themselves. People rightly expect that in some circumstances managers can
act as trainers, because they are the ones with the most relevant knowledge.
Most managers have the time and the skill to become explicit trainers rather
than simply people to be imitated. They can do a very useful job. Some
organisations have attempted to re-define job titles to reflect this. (Thus
supervisors may become 'coaches'; and managers 'the support staff.'
Using subordinate feedback: Most managers are used to being appraised by
their superiors, and occasionally by their peers. Trainers, on the other
hand, are used to being rated by their course attenders.
Many organisations are even considering using subordinate ratings, not only
as useful feedback technique in training, but also a possible source of data
for staff appraisals. More and more trainers now are using upward or
'bottom-up' feedback compared to the more traditional downward appraisal.
But pity the middle aged, middle-brow, middle manager who, as part of his
training, has to learn business French; go on outdoor training courses to be
a good team member; is called a marketing coach; and is rated on his
performance by a youth just out of a 'new' university business school.

FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Business Schools (7): Tempo steps into Europe -
Cranfield's emphasis is on the practical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRANFIELD is about to change its title from 'institute of technology' to
'university'. It is a sad commentary on the status of vocationally-oriented
higher education institutions in Britain that Cranfield finally felt it had
to join the crowd. The assumption of university titles by the former
polytechnics was the last straw.
'If we could have sold our name like MIT (the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology at Boston, in the US), we would have stuck to it,' says Professor
Leo Murray, Cranfield School of Management's ebullient director.
'But with every primary school in the country now calling itself a
university, people simply don't understand what we are about.'
Murray is adamant as to what his school, the largest of Cranfield
university-to-be's four centres, is about. 'The practical and applied is our
concern: high quality training to produce effective managers - whether on
our MBA courses, or in our growing short-course market.'
'Management is an intensely practical subject,' he says, deflecting
criticism of the School's mediocre performance in the Universities Funding
Council's recent assessment of research quality. 'Our research is
unambiguously applied: grand theory really has little or nothing to do with
management studies as they should be.'
'The emphasis is, and should be, on practical training for practical
problems; and research into issues that will help students and managers to
do that.'
It is for such practical skills that a steady stream of top executives and
upwardly-mobile young managers drive to rural Bedfordshire, or make the
20-minute cab ride from Milton Keynes.
Cranfield started life in 1946 as a school of aeronautical engineering - on
the site, and in the buildings, of a wartime aerodrome, appropriately
enough. Until Sir Norman Foster designed for the school a magnificent
steel-and-glass library, which was opened last year, the campus resembled a
prisoner-of-war camp; now that the giant hangar-style library is complete
and open, it looks as if might house the Royal Flight.
Murray does 'not for a moment' doubt that his charge is among the elect of
the business school fraternity. He is particularly proud of Cranfield's
range of tailored-courses, and of the 'Cranfield 2000' project to keep its
MBA up-to-date.
For the moment, Cranfield 2,000 means 'breaking down the old baronies' which
divide the MBA into hard-and-fast subjects (marketing, finance and so on)
and, instead, 'conceiving of it in the context of the company, where the
various specialisms inter-connect and overlap.' In everyday terms, this
means laying stress on group working and company case studies; and a growing
emphasis on international business - together with the skills that go with
it, including languages.
Like most UK business schools, behind the rhetoric of 'internationalisation'
Cranfield is Britannic to the core. Language training apart, Murray's
response is not, a la London Business School, to seek to change radically
from within, but to forge new partnerships from without.
The imminent creation of a Top European Management Programme ('Tempo') is a
significant step on the way: a consortium of Cranfield, Group ESC Lyon,
Instituto de Empresa in Barcelona and USW Schloss Gracht in Germany, Tempo
is intended to enable each of the four to design tailored in-company
programmes drawing on the resources and facilities of other members.
Cranfield is also working with Groupe ESC Lyon and Koblenz University's
Forum Mittelstand to launch a joint European Management programme -
'designed', says the blurb, 'to teach participants to Think European and Act
Local.'
Numbers on the part- and full-time MBA courses are roughly equal, at between
140 and 160 apiece. The part-time course is not an add-on: equal resources
are devoted to it, with special efforts made to strengthen links with
sponsoring employers. These include regular 'parents' days' (Cranfield's
jargon) when sponsors are invited to spend a day at the school to review
progress and discuss suitable project work for the last stage of the course.
However, the MBA is playing a declining role in the School's funding.
Last year three-quarters of its income came from other sources - not much
from the government, which accounted for less than 10 per cent, but mainly
from research and contracts (27 per cent) and, most important of all, short
courses (37 per cent).
In common with other schools, the emphasis is increasingly on
company-specific tailored courses. Cranfield's client base now extends well
beyond the UK; it takes programmes out to the Community, Scandinavia and the
Far East. Murray even has designs on China, 'a more attractive long-term
proposition than eastern Europe, which seems to me to be a swamp.'
Back home, the public sector is tomorrow's expansion. In 1991 the School of
Management merged with the School of Policy Studies, and a range of courses
targeted at public sector managers have followed on. The most illustrious
recruit is the Bank of England - a contract agreed before last October, Mr
Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, might care to note.

LSE insists that it is really not a 'business' school at all

THE LOUD fanfares greeting the recent entry of Oxford and Cambridge into the
management school firmament were notably absent from the reception given to
another of the UK's elite academic institutions, the London School of
Economics (LSE).
To be fair, so obsessed was the LSE with schemes to transplant itself to
County Hall, facing the Houses of Parliament across the Thames, that its
more fruitful projects were easy to miss.
It is now two and a half years since the LSE, Britain's leading social
science university, established an Institute of Management.
The institute is already a highly-rated undergraduate school, and it is now
about to launch both masters and doctoral programmes.
The biggest feather in its cap, however, is its status as the UK
representative in the Community of European Management Schools (CEMS).
CEMS is a consortium of eleven top European management schools. Collectively
it runs exchange schemes and aims to produce an integrated academic
curriculum for management schools across the Continent.
Other members of CEMS include Rotterdam's Erasmus University, Vienna's
Wirtschaftsuniversitat and the Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales at
Paris.
The institute's director, Professor Peter Abell, insists that his charge is
not a business school.
'We are an explicitly inter-disciplinary management institute playing to a
niche - the strength of our social science faculties. We are not a
vocational training school for business studies. We do not do an MBA, nor
will we; and all the appointments to the institute are joint appointments
with other departments.' He does not mince his words as to why.
'There is some fairly clear evidence that the sort of people appointed to
business schools are not the best academics.'
By implication, 'business studies' are not thought to be much academic cop
either - a sentiment shared by a large part of the academic community in
Britain.
Abell puts it more tactfully: 'We are concerned with the management
applications of rigorous study of the main branches of social science, not
with economics, and so on, as 'add ons' to courses in 'business''.
When this coming September's intake of undergraduates arrives, the institute
will have more than a hundred first degree students. Four-fifths of last
year's recruits were from abroad; with most attaining or exceeding the
institute's 'conditional entry' standard of three A-level grades at ABB (or
the equivalent in academic standing), they are among the best qualified
students at the LSE.
The institute's masters programme in management is due to be launched next
year, with 'advanced management theory' at its core and options on subjects
such as international relations, development studies, and mathematics and
statistics to follow.
Its doctoral programme emphasises inter-disciplinary research and
quantitative methods.
Two aspects of the CEMS exercise have a direct bearing on the institute.
These are the requirement to have corporate partners, and the exchange
scheme with fellow members. The LSE's corporate partners, British Airways
and Coopers and Lybrand, have a role in curriculum development, and they
will be expected, in due course, to arrange placements for students.
All UK-resident students do an internship in another country; by the end of
their courses they are expected to be competent in three languages.
If the emphasis on economic theory and international relations marks the LSE
apart, its growth projections appear to be Xeroxed from the typical business
school of yesteryear. It wants to double in size, 'in due course'.

FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Business Schools (6): Cosmopolitan vigour - A look
at IMD's mission in partnership with companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMD is not as large or well known as France's Insead and the London Business
School. But among aficionados of management education the International
Institute for Management Development at Lausanne, Switzerland, is
increasingly mentioned in the same breath.
The school's 'mission' - which comes in three parts - is a useful clue to
its character: IMD wants to be as internationally-minded as possible; it
aims to teach general management skills to senior executives; it wishes to
maintain and strengthen its already close partnership with industry.
Its location in a small neutral country, Switzerland - and furthermore, in
Switzerland's minority French-speaking region - certainly helps discourage
an inward looking culture. IMD's present MBA class, 82-strong, boasts almost
30 different nationalities, and the teaching staff is similarly
cosmopolitan. For the visitor, the campus flavour is distinctively European,
with more than a dash of North American openness and vigour.
That is scarcely surprising. IMEDE - one of the two Swiss business schools
which merged to form IMD in 1989 - was itself created in 1957 by Nestle with
the support of Harvard Business School. (The other institution in the
merger, IMI-Geneva, was founded in 1946 by Alcan Aluminium.)
Today IMD is supported by 30 business 'partners', companies which typically
fill, together with 'associates'' participants, about 60 per cent of the
places on IMD courses. Partners can also benefit from tailored programmes,
such as those which concentrate on specific company problems, involving,
say, 15 to 20 employees at a time. These have represented a big growth area
in recent years, and now account for about 40 per cent of IMD's total
income.
A separate tier of financial backers comprises 80 business 'associates',
whose main contribution is to attend about 10 brainstorming sessions laid on
by the school administrators each year. 'The partners are the companies
which are really driving us,' explains Paul Adams, director of external
relations. 'We have a very close relationship with them.'
IMD's target audience is mainly those in middle and senior executive
positions seeking general management skills. In the overall business mix the
one year MBA course is relatively unimportant: it accounts for a mere 4 per
cent of IMD's income. But its significance, in terms of faculty teaching
time and the intellectual development of the school, is much greater.
IMD's flagship course at present is probably the 10 week Programme for
Executive Development (PED). Dr Peter Lorange, the school's Norwegian
president-elect says it is intended 'to make people good in a technical
sense, to make them more commercial (that is, when it comes to closing a
deal), and to improve their internal motivation.' Lorange says that longer
general management courses - with an international orientation - are doing
well at the moment; shorter ones, he adds, are proving less successful.
Though companies are often taking a commendably long view when it comes to
training - 'If you go back in history people have cut management education
budgets more than they have this time,' says Paul Adams - IMD has not been
untouched by recession. Adams points out that business schools are competing
hard for executive time, and that key managers cannot always be spared at a
time of restructuring. Overall 1992 numbers at IMD were 15 per cent down on
1990, 'though we are finding that where companies haven't hired graduates,
they are putting more money into management education.'
Adams also emphasises that the MBA course - a highly intensive 11 month
programme with an age profile of 26 to 34 - has grown in size, even if the
rate of increase of applications has slowed down. There were about 700
hopefuls for the 82 places on offer this year.
Potential areas of expansion such as Eastern Europe have been rather
disappointing. Lorange says IMD has been working with some multinationals;
teaching facilities are being developed. 'It is being done as part of our
value creation here, though, rather than sending a team over there. We do go
sometimes, but mostly to fact-find - to research.'

FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Business Schools (4): Quality matches the quantity
 -Warwick University's business school has the largest faculty in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH 130 full-time academic staff, Warwick University's Business School
(WBS) has the largest faculty of any university business/management
department in UK higher education.
It has quality to match the quantity. The Universities Funding Council's
recent assessment of university research output gave Warwick a '5' rating.
It was one of only seven institutions judged to be publishing work of
international excellence.
Few quibble with the UFC's judgment. But Warwick's reputation is of recent
growth. While the university's industrial relations research unit has a
reputation going back 30 years, its business school rose to prominence only
in the late 1980s.
The transformation was the result of smart footwork, and strong leadership,
by George Bain, now principal of London Business School.
Bain not only masterminded the change: he personifies it. Arriving at
Warwick in 1979 as professor of industrial relations, he became chairman of
the School of Industrial and Business Studies four years later. By the time
he left for London in 1989, it had become Warwick Business School.
'Industrial relations' - words redolent of the corporatist, union-dominated
1960s - were banished from the title and incorporated as just one pillar in
a reconstructed edifice. Symbolically, his successor, Robin Wensley, is a
marketing specialist, who spent much of the 1980s researching 'market share
effect' - the relationship between finance, accounting, and marketing in
investment decisions and strategic planning. And Wensley came from LBS.
Insiders talk of a 'palace revolution' under Bain. Whatever the history, the
legacy is a department combining a formidable research record with a large
undergraduate intake and a highly-rated MBA programme.
More important, for grant purposes, WBS is quick to react to changes in the
academic-political climate for business studies. The Economic and Social
Research Council (ESRC) provides the bulk of WBS's Pounds 3m grant and
contract income, and for the medium term, its council funding is assured.
Though all its faculty are expected to publish regularly, WBS has four
centres dedicated to research in particular sectors:
The Centre for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs), which includes a
small business research programme led by David Storey. Among its larger
contracts, National Westminster Bank is paying Pounds 129,000 for a start-up
business survey, and the European Commission is paying Pounds 130,000 for a
study of the international role of SMEs in regional development.
The Centre for Corporate Strategy and Change, directed by Andrew Pettigrew,
author of a celebrated study of ICI (as was), and more recently of Managing
Change for Competitive Success (with Richard Whipp), a leading account of
how Britain's boardrooms have come to grips with external pressures.
The well-honed Warwick instinct at work, Pettigrew moved away from ICI a
decade ago and is now preoccupied with the public sector. His research group
is currently studying management styles and systems in the new-style
National Health Service, courtesy of a Pounds 330,000 grant from Department
of Health.
The Industrial Relations Research Unit. Surprise surprise, the unit is
moving into European employment trends and the employment effects of
compulsory competitive tendering in local government.
The WBS Research Bureau, under Paul Stoneman, an umbrella group embracing
everything from a centre for the study of new technology, to centres for
local government, financial options and performance measurement.
Stoneman sees research as WBS's main raison d'etre ('I don't have anything
to do with teaching'). A priority is to improve conditions for the 40-odd
full-time researchers on short-term contracts. 'Over the past 15 years
research has become a career for the first time; for researchers to have to
live in a hand-to-mouth manner on two-year contracts is neither feasible nor
desirable,' he says.
Accordingly WBS has started to offer rolling contracts to its best research
staff, and will foot the bill itself if necessary.
Another priority is to make the School more international. Almost its entire
faculty is British; most of its work is UK-focused; and a gripe - one of the
few - of the MBA students is the Anglo-US-centric nature of their case
studies. The creation of a chair in international business was intended to
help remedy the weakness; it has been filled by a professor from Glasgow.
Robin Wensley insists that research and teaching go hand in hand. None of
the sneers about 'finishing-school undergraduate courses' are to be heard at
Warwick. WBS has 110 undergraduate places a year: for this September's entry
it had 1,600 qualified applicants, with A-level conditional offers in the
Oxbridge region of ABB.
Mr Wensley says: 'Undergraduates are vital to us; not least because they
unite us strongly with the rest of the university. MBA-only schools can too
easily become worlds apart.'
WBS has the now-typical array of MBAs, including one of Britain's first
modular courses, launched last month. Its full-time course, 123-strong this
year, lasts one year, a strong selling point if this year's intake is any
guide. It is not hard to see why: the students estimates that, all told, the
year will cost them about Pounds 25,000 - 'and that's just about all the
human capital investment I can put up with,' quips one.
The fastest growing MBA is the distance learning course. 'The market took
off in a way no-one expected,' says Suzanne Alexander, the course
co-ordinator.
It can be completed in three years, but most students take between 3.5 and
four. Students must spend at least eight days at classes at Warwick during
the year, and can attend for up to another seven days. The intake is mostly
private sector, leavened by a few NHS employees.
'Integration is the key,' says Robin Wensley. 'We have lots of different
course and research 'limbs', but they are all part of the same basic body.
We haven't gone heavily into the short-course and other markets just to pump
the cash flow.' Thanks to the ESRC, Warwick can afford to be so high-minded.

FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Business Schools (5): Here the customers come
first - In the US, near Chicago, Northwestern's Kellogg School is thriving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARNING a management degree at the JL Kellogg Graduate School of Management
is an experience as much as an education, say present students and recent
graduates.
Co-operative learning, total quality management, and putting the customer
first are principles pervading the curriculum.
Unlike many top-ranked B-schools, the emphasis is on co-operation, rather
than competition - and the administration practises what the curriculum
preaches.
'You really get the feeling that they're marketing to the students, that
they're really responsive to our needs,' says one first-year student.
Situated on a curve of Lake Michigan at Northwestern University in the
Chicago suburb of Evanston, the Kellogg School has been ranked first for
three years running in Business Week magazine's survey of top US graduate
business schools. (It held the top rank for four of the five years the
magazine has conducted the poll.)
Grander schools such as Harvard, Stanford, and even Kellogg's prestigious
neighbour to the south, the University of Chicago, grouse that these
rankings, based on votes by recruiters and recent graduates, do not measure
a school's real mettle.
'Their next Nobel will be their first,' snipes a student at Chicago (ranked
number two), (Since 1988 Chicago has had three faculty members named as
Nobel laureates.) Mr Donald Jacobs, Kellogg's long-time dean, agrees.
'We don't put a lot of emphasis on the rankings,' he says, adding that if
they have any impact, the widely distributed polls force every school to be
more attentive to the needs of their students; to be better marketeers.
Mr Jacobs was appointed dean of Kellogg's in 1975. The school's move from
obscurity to become an internationally-recognised name, carries his imprint.
Long before it was fashionable, Jacobs created a special graduate programme
for business executives, and built a lovely lakeside hostel, the Allen
Center, to house his corporate students.
The Allen Center developed out of Mr Jacobs's conviction that a top-notch
business school should have professors with training in disciplines such as
economics and psychology, not business, and be at the cutting edge of
research in their field.
'We came up with the idea of building an executive centre on the campus and
having executives here all the time. That way we would not only train the
faculty (in business), but we would also earn money to finance research,'
Jacobs recalls.
Nearly every other business school in the US has imitated the concept, and
the Allen Center itself continues to grow and to turn out corporate
graduates. The executives form a loyal cult of business leaders who are
enthusiastic Kellogg supporters. They donate time and money; hire Kellogg
graduates; and provide real-world sounding boards for Kellogg's faculty.
Mr Jacobs has been careful to cultivate that goodwill. His 150-person
advisory board reads like a Who's Who of American business. He can assemble
on short notice a round table of corporate titans such as George Fisher of
Motorola.
'Don has a real knack for reaching out into the community,' says Mr William
Brodsky, president of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and a Kellogg advisory
board member. He says the continuity of Kellogg's relationships is unique.
'It is a very pro-active relationship. They call on us on a regular basis.'
Notwithstanding his busy schedule, Mr Brodsky personally spends three or
four days a year at Kellogg, and says the CME and the school have discovered
many synergies.
When Mr Jacobs was appointed as dean, Kellogg had a respected undergraduate
business programme and a second-rate graduate school. It had no general
endowment and only two endowed chairs. Jacobs' mix of marketing savvy and
academic quality has built an endowment of Dollars 120m - second only to
Harvard's. Kellogg now has 57 endowed professorships. During Mr Jacob's
tenure, between Dollars 40m and Dollars 50m in new facilities has been built
and paid for by the school.
This year Kellogg has about 1,100 full-time day students and 1,300 part-time
evening masters candidates. The school no longer has an undergraduate
programme - it was a casualty of the graduate school expansion. Business
Week pegged the average pay of a new Kellogg graduate last year at Dollars
70,200 - 'value' recruiters say, when compared to the Harvard Business
School's average Dollars 84,960. The schools' annual tuition charges are
similar, at just over Dollars 18,500.
Students say that one of the distinctive aspects of Kellogg is its pervasive
use of group learning. Students are encouraged to engage in group
problem-solving from the day they arrive. Recruiters find that the approach
produces managers who can successfully navigate the politics of corporate
life.
At a time when other top-notch business schools are undergoing rigorous
self-scrutiny to make sure that their curriculums are suitable for the
1990s, Dean Jacobs says that Kellogg is not going to change course.
'In a rapidly changing world, you can't wait 20 years and then change the
curriculum,' he says. 'You have to change constantly. We change ours an
average of ten to fifteen times a year.'

FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Business Schools (2): Some employers are sceptical
 -Around the world, the MBA provokes a variety of reactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRASH yuppy in red braces, with the passport to a megabucks salary? Or the
experienced international executive, endowed with the most respected and
widely recognised management qualification?
There is some evidence that the unflattering image of the MBA is being laid
to rest. But this high-profile product of a still growing number of North
American, British and continental European business schools still provokes
sceptical reactions from certain employers.
The MBA market is at an important juncture. Following three years of hectic
growth in the numbers joining MBA courses in the UK, it looks as though
1993, at least, will be something of a disappointment. The prestigious
schools still have many more good applicants than places, but research by
the London-based Association of MBAs (Amba) suggests that, overall, the
recent trend has been reversed.
Amba's preliminary findings show that students joining UK courses this year
 -more than 90 - are down by 10-15 per cent. And the funds allocated to
would-be MBAs under the association's loan scheme have fallen by one third.
'My gut feeling is that this is the effect of the recession finally coming
through,' says Mr Roger McCormick, director general of Amba. 'There is a
general view that it takes two years for an MBA candidate to get to the
starting gate. It takes time to get a spouse or partner on side, to quit a
job, to find the necessary funds, and to apply to a good business school.'
Mr McCormick believes that next year will probably be flat, but that growth
should resume thereafter. 'At least there is far less witless talk of
indefinite expansion, and more of a willingness to go back to basics and
address what the market and industry really want,' he says.
Professor Jim Ellert, MBA faculty co-ordinator at the International
Institute for Management Development (IMD) in Lausanne, Switzerland,
acknowledges that there has been a 'flattening out' in the number of
applicants for IMD's MBA course, and that this pattern is probably reflected
elsewhere on the continent.
'Is it temporary, due to the state of the economy and the greater risks of
leaving a safe job? Or is it a secular trend? My feeling is that it is the
cycle, but not everyone here agrees. It will be three to five years before
we know for sure,' Professor Ellert says.
At the London Business School, where numbers this autumn are likely to be
down after a record 200 plus intake last October, Catherine Hastings says:
'For many schools it's a choice between reducing the size of the class or
letting the quality slip.'
In the US the situation is rather different. The total number of MBA
graduates each year has reached a plateau at about 70,000 - but this is a
very high number: three times the UK output on a population adjusted basis.
Besides coming to terms with a more competitive market place many of the top
business schools - Harvard, Wharton, the LBS, for instance - have trying
hard to tailor curricula better to the needs of industry. 'On a lot of
courses there is less of the tidy boxes with, say, marketing, finance and
human resources taught at different times of the day, and more integration
and project work demonstrating how messy things are in the real world,' says
one commentator.
The practical emphasis is particularly notable in the US, where
'internationalisation' is now in vogue. But many European schools claim to
have the edge; they suspect that some of their North American counterparts
believe it is enough to demonstrate that 10 per cent of their class members
come from the Far East.
Internationalisation is not just about participant mix - although
enthusiasts stress that the benefits of being in an MBA class with students
from 30 or 40 other countries, and seeing problems from so many different
points of view, are incalculable. Equally important is the course content
and faculty approach.
Research conducted this year by Hay Management Consultants, based on more
than 2,200 respondents* indicates that about 30 per cent of UK MBA graduates
end up in consultancy or finance. A significant proportion is employed by
manufacturing industries, while 10 per cent plump for education or other
parts of the public sector.
LBS says it has recently noted a new bias towards manufacturing, and growing
interest from multinationals attracted by an MBA's internationally
transferable skills. Others note a trend for MBAs to move from larger to
smaller companies.
The Hay survey probably provides the most detailed picture of the current
British MBA.
It shows that the most important motivation for pursuing an MBA is to change
an individual's career path; closely followed by a desire for improved job
opportunities. Increasing salary was more likely to be mentioned by those
graduating in the late 1980s than in the early 1990s.
The survey nevertheless demonstrates that MBAs can expect a reasonable
salary increase on qualification. In 1991 the figure for those changing
their employer immediately after graduation was 34 per cent, representing a
16.5 per cent increase on top of the average earnings index during the
course of their studies. The premium, though, was lower than that gained
during the 1980s, and may be lower now.
An important conclusion of the research is the shift towards part-time
courses with employer backing. Of those who had all their fees paid by their
employer, more than 72 per cent stayed loyal for at least a year after
graduation.
The findings of the survey are encouraging, but there are still many
unresolved issues facing the MBA 'industry'. Are there not too many business
schools offering this qualification in the UK? Should not mergers be
considered, as a way of improving standards and recruiting better faculty?
Why is it that, while Anglo-Saxon economies have MBAs coming out of their
ears, MBA graduates are so few in Germany and Japan?
As Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British Industry,
put it in a lecture earlier this year, there are other systems for
guaranteeing a supply of competent, trained managers. The MBA should be
seen, he said, 'as just one aspect of a manager's development, rather than
as an elegant capstone to the 5-21 education of a select few.'
The MBA has its place, but it will always have to try hard to be relevant
and viable.

FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Business Schools (3): Stakeholding is the buzzword
 -Andrew Adonis analyses the responses of business school students
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS

<TEXT>
GREEN not mean, pragmatic not Utopian.
That sums up the outlook of today's generation of business students - if a
recent survey of 700 of them from five continents and 23 countries is any
guide.
The survey was conducted by the Prince of Wales' Business Forum to coincide
with last month's annual congress of the the AISEC international student
organisation, held at Brighton in the UK. It shows the extent to which a
decade of sloganising about 'stakeholding' and 'responsibility to the
environment' have sunk in.
Asked to rank the roles of a company in order of importance, the students,
whose average age was 21, put high quality goods and services top. Skill
training came second and safeguarding the environment third (see inset).
Shareholders get short shrift, their interests prioritised (in the
management jargon) behind quality, research, workforce, even being 'a
positive force for social change.'
If that sounds a bit soppy, other questions show the greenery and social
conscience of today's students to be of anything but the 'save the whale'
variety.
On the contrary, their elders might be taken aback by the hard-headed
attitude to politics and the world beyond business. Donating funds to
not-for-profit organisations came last of the students' priorities, below
'exerting influence on government economic policy'.
Corporate reputation and success-within-respectable-bounds are what matter
most to the students surveyed, all of them at business schools or studying
business at university.
It is exhibited graphically in responses to the question: 'which perceptions
of a company will be most important for its corporate reputation?' Bottom
came: 'Good at spotting short-term opportunities for high profits'; but
second from bottom was: 'generous benefactor, contributing to charity'.
So Hanson and Rowntree are both out. 'Stakeholding' is the international
buzz-word: to the question 'will stakeholders - not just shareholders, but
employees, customers, consumers and local communities  - expect more, the
same level or less corporate responsibility in the future than today?', nine
out of ten said 'more'.
Corporate reputation was felt to be particularly important in establishing
companies overseas.
Here again, however, the element of calculating cost-benefit is barely
suppressed: although a little over half of the respondents believed
'corporate community affairs' to be an 'essential aspect of modern good
business practice', four in ten thought such matters were best left to the
company's marketing and PR departments.
Plus ca change  ..

FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Business Schools (1): Horses for courses - In the
1980s an MBA was increasingly seen as the passport to managerial promotion.
International demand for business schools rose and numbers grew, but the
1990s have brought recession and a more discriminating market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS

<TEXT>
FOR BUSINESS schools, the halcyon days are long gone.
The rapid, almost wild expansion of the 1980s has given way to retrenchment,
greater competition, and strategies aimed at diversifying from the old
'staples' of off-the-peg management courses and the traditional Master of
Business Administration (MBA) degree.
Those beautiful upward curves adorning business school reports on 'growth' a
few years' ago have been redrawn, as deans strive anxiously to maintain
numbers and quality of intake.
For the discriminating consumer - from the supervisor after a cheap
part-time management diploma to the multinational buying a dozen tailor-made
courses for senior executives - it is a shoppers' paradise.
'At best the MBA market is static; in fact, it's probably declining, and
most deans are not being completely honest about what is happening,' says Dr
Robin Wensley, chairman of Warwick Business School.
Yet precise figures on the downturn are scarce. 'There is an absolute welter
of fibbing out there', says one well-placed US and UK observer -
particularly when it comes to ratios of applicants to places.
Mr Roger McCormick, director general of the UK's Association of MBAs,
estimates that this year's (1992-93) intake for MBA courses is down by about
15 per cent on last year. 'Some are doing far better than that; others are
purporting to show strength until you start looking at the rising proportion
of overseas students.'.
However, the biggest mistake in the book is to regard business schools as a
monolith. And not just with regard to their success in recruiting. As a
group, they differ as much as any other sub-set of educational institutions.
When it comes to sorting out the elite from the rest, few make the mistake.
Every would-be American MBA has her or his - predominantly his - list of
leading schools, in which Harvard, Wharton, Stanford, Kellogg and Chicago
invariably feature; he 'knows' that the London Business School, Insead and
IMD are Europe's top dogs; and the MBA fraternity within those west European
countries which take formal business education seriously - which is all the
larger states besides Germany - can name their own top few schools.
But when it comes to the world below the top table, to most consumers -
individuals and companies alike - it is an undifferentiated mass.
League tables, much in vogue, are of only limited help in differentiating.
This survey deliberately eschews crude rankings. There is no one single
yardstick by which to measure a school; even if you know the yardstick you
want, a simple ranking rarely gives more than a one-dimensional picture. For
an individual, the best course is to visit the institution - and wade
through the literature, not just for course descriptions and subjective
evaluations, but basic facts about duration, cost, placement success, and so
on. For companies, word-of-mouth, surveys and consultants go so far; but
there is no substitute for meeting deans and directors face to face. It all
depends what you want.
Take cost. Annual tuition fees for full-time US MBA courses currently vary
from about Dollars 19,000 (Pounds 12,600) at the likes of Columbia, Harvard
and Stanford to Dollars 12,000 (Pounds 8,000) or less at Lexington
(Kentucky), Terry (Georgia) and Austin (Texas).
But tuition fees are only the start: the difference between a one or
two-year MBA, or between a part-time or distance-learning course, also has
to be weighed in salary foregone, family relocated, social life neglected.
Another error is to think that business schools and MBAs are synonymous.
They are not. Schools cater for three principal markets: undergraduates, MBA
and other graduate students, and management training courses. Even for those
running high-profile MBAs, the bread and butter generally comes from
courses.
Few schools are active in all three markets. None of Europe's three
acknowledged leaders teaches undergraduates; nor do any of the US Ivy League
schools besides Pennsylvania's Wharton. Typically, it is more a matter of
history than conscious market orientation: most schools were set up in the
post-war years as dedicated post-graduate institutions, while those which
began life as departments of older universities often still take
undergraduates.
Wharton's undergraduate school, for instance, pre-dates its graduate school
by 40 years. Wharton currently has 2,500 business undergraduates against
1,500 MBAs and 300 doctoral students. 'Some companies are saying, why are we
hiring MBAs when we can get first degree business grads young and mould them
into our corporate culture; they also fear they are paying too much for what
they are getting for an MBA', says Ms Janice Mellace, Wharton's vice dean.
With applications for undergraduate business courses - unlike MBAs - booming
on both sides of the Atlantic, that refrain may soon become deafening,
although intriguingly, some 40 per cent of Wharton's business undergrads go
on to do an MBA at a later stage.
Distance learning is another unambiguous growth area. Britain's Open
Business School, a part of its Open University, accounted for one in eight
of this year's MBA enrolments in the UK; from next year it will be turning
out 1,000 MBAs a year, a number set to rise further.
As detailed in a later article, that is only the 'top drawer' of the OBS's
portfolio of management courses, which aims to reach those parts traditional
business schools have rarely reached - both downwards (to supervisors and
the like) and across (to the public sector and abroad, particularly mainland
Europe).
Britain, of course, is semi-detached from Europe. So are most of its
business schools (LBS is a notable exception), which preach
'internationalisation' but rarely have more than a smattering of mainland
European faculty, students, or teaching material. If you are after a truly
European school, you should think seriously about going there.
And 'there' is not just Insead (Paris) or IMD (Lausanne), but the numerous
other highly-rated institutions, not least Rotterdam School of Management,
Nijenrode University (also in the Netherlands), Spain's Instituto de Empresa
in Barcelona and France's Groupe ESC Lyon.
Ironically, English is now all but the official language of the leading
Dutch business schools. Barely a quarter of the MBA students at Rotterdam
School of Management, part of Erasmus University, are Dutch: other Europeans
make up a further third; Americans a fifth; 15 per cent are from Asia.
Moving further east, business schools are sprouting en masse. According to
Professor Derek Abell, research co-ordinator at IMD and actively engaged in
the former eastern bloc, central and eastern Europe now boasts more than 100
business schools. In Hungary alone there are more than 50.
'They vary tremendously in quality,' he says. 'There are probably a dozen -
one in each of the major countries - you would hold up to be doing something
intelligent; and a sea of others, some in joint ventures.'
However, for most western business schools, tending the home patch is the
all-consuming priority. That means a bevy of new products; strenuous efforts
to recruit senior executives to invest their time and prestige on 'advisory
boards' or as 'corporate sponsors'; and ever more frantic bids to present
oneself as different and better (hardly a dean in Britain or the US is not
claiming to be adopting new learning methods or to be 'fundamentally
rethinking' course curriculums).
For many, it is a raw question of survival. Professor David Ashton, chairman
of the UK's Association of Business Schools and Dean of Lancaster University
Management School, expresses a widespread view: 'I would be glad if the
market downturn led to fewer, stronger institutions. At the moment we (the
UK) have 92 institutions, with yet more planning to join the scrimmage.'
But, he notes, 'no machinery exists within which to discuss such a proposal,
so the market will have to do its work.' Unless, that is, new ways can be
found to expand the market. Notice the number of schools jumping on the
distance learning wagon.
It used to be a joke, Ashton remarks, 'that the only concept which business
schools taught their vice-chancellors was the concept of the cash cow.'
Perhaps the next lesson will be on ritual slaughter.

FT  29 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Warning of London bus plan 'chaos'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSPORT IN London could be thrown into chaos if the government presses
ahead with its plans to deregulate the capital's bus services, MPs were told
yesterday.
The unanimous warning, delivered to the cross-party Commons transport
committee, came from the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, the
Association of County Councils and the Association of District Councils  -
between them representing every local authority outside London.
Mr Mark Dowd of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities said experience
of bus deregulation in Britain's other big cities showed it would be 'a
total and utter disaster' if extended to the capital.
Mr Gordon Kingdon, representing the Association of District Councils, said:
'We cannot say anything other than that it's a risk too great to take in
London.'
Bus deregulation, introduced everywhere in Britain except London in 1986,
means that any competent operator can run any service it likes.
It has been accompanied by an increase in the number of buses in operation
but a decrease in the overall number of passengers.
The cabinet is today expected to agree that legislation to deregulate
London's bus services should be introduced in the next parliamentary session
and put into effect in 1995.
The local authority associations said fares in metropolitan areas had risen
by 30 per cent in real terms since dereg-ulation and the cost of
travel-cards, where they still existed, had gone up by even more.
Mr Peter Sephton, managing director of Sheffield's municipally owned South
Yorkshire Transport, said de-regulation was 'one of the daftest policies
that anyone can possibly imagine for public transport'.
Mr Sephton described how bus drivers deliberately blocked the road with
their vehicles when picking up passengers at stops to prevent competing
buses over-taking.
Operators also caused congestion by halting at busy stops for long periods
to pick up as many passengers as they could before continuing with their
journeys, he said, pre-dicting that extending deregulation to London would
have similar effects in the capital.

FT  29 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM fails to calm fears of Bosnia
action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday joined Nato military leaders in saying clear
political objectives had to be set before military action was taken in
Bosnia - but did little to calm speculation that Britain would reluctantly
back air strikes if pressed by the US.
Amid continuing concerns within Whitehall and Westminster of the US
triggering precipitate action that would jeopardise western humanitarian
efforts, the prime minister's office said military operations had to be
regarded as a means to a political end.
A postponement by the US of a decision on military action until next week
will be greeted with relief in Whitehall.
Downing Street expects President Bill Clinton to consult with European
allies first.
It said the best political objective would be to implement the peace plan
which had been drawn up by United Nations' peace negotiators Lord Owen and
Mr Cyrus Vance.
Concern about US intentions and the consequences of Britain becoming
embroiled in an escalated military conflict will surface among Tory and
Labour MPs when the Commons debates Bosnia today.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, is likely to stress the importance of
humanitarian aid and the perils of various options for military action when
he opens the debate.
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Tory chairman of the all-party Commons defence
committee, said the government faced, 'a series of unattractive options. We
have to decide which is the least unattractive'.
However, the prime minister's office indicated that Britain could back the
threat of air strikes if the government believed it would achieve a
political objective.
Separately, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, said: 'There can be
military action which will help and, clearly, one will be very unwise to
rule it out completely.
'Specific kinds of military action, particularly from the air, can sometimes
eliminate sources of aggression and can deal with particular threats.'
The option of air strikes 'has to be looked at extraordinarily carefully to
make sure that it would indeed achieve the result that is being advocated',
he added.
Mr Major was responding to a warning by Sir Richard Vincent, chairman of
Nato's military committee, that western leaders had to be precise about what
they wanted to achieve in Bosnia.
Meanwhile, Labour leaders headed off an attempt by Mr Tony Benn, leftwing
Labour MP for Chesterfield, to win backing from the party's ruling national
executive committee for a policy of no military intervention.
The NEC backed overwhelmingly a call from Mr John Smith, Labour leader, for
further Serb advances to be checked by the threat of air strikes on Serb
communication and supply lines in Bosnia.

FT  29 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Crime clear-up rate declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of crimes cleared up by the police fell last year for the first
time in three years, according to Home Office figures yesterday.
Six per cent fewer notifiable offences were cleared up than in 1991.
The figures marred a slowdown in the growth of the total number of crimes
reported.
Mr Michael Jack, the junior Home Office minister, said that the 6 per cent
rise in the number of crimes which were recorded last year was 'encouraging'
compared with the 16 per cent increase in 1991.
The biggest rises in crime last year were cases of robbery and burglary
which rose by 17 per cent and 11 per cent respectively.
The number of residential burglaries rose faster than non-residential
burglaries.
The smallest increase was in the number of reported sexual offences. There
was a fall in fraud and forgery cases.
Across regions, there were falls in the number of crimes reported in
Northumbria and in the City of London.
However, crime in Cheshire rose by almost 20 per cent.
Violent crimes had much better clear up rates with 95 per cent of homicides
cleared up last year.
The clear up rate for burglaries was 20 per cent.

FT  29 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Mr Portillo sets the agenda -
Political Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS is the time of year when cabinet ministers write begging letters to the
chief secretary to the Treasury. The ones landing on Mr Michael Portillo's
desk at the end of this week will be more than usually anguished.
It is the start of the public spending round: that annual, peculiarly
British, ritual during which Whitehall departments battle between themselves
and against the Treasury over the size and share-out of the government's
budget.
By November, when the chancellor unveils his first unified Budget, everyone
will have been declared a winner.
The chief secretary will insist he has maintained a tight grip on spending
and borrowing.
His cabinet colleagues will claim they have got the cash they need to build
new hospitals, roads, prisons and the like.
This year, though, it will not be easy. For the first time since the early
1980s, squaring the circle between fiscal virtue and public-sector largesse
will require more than sleight of hand and clever Whitehall presentation.
With public borrowing running at Pounds 1bn a week, there are no extra
billions on offer to massage the egos of the spending ministers or to put
out political fires on the backbenches.
The tax increases announced last month and the introduction of the unified
Budget have made more explicit than ever the direct trade-off between
spending and taxation.
To meet its self-imposed spending targets, the government will have to start
making visible inroads into the welfare state. Mr Major, elected on a
platform promising to restore the social conscience of conservatism, will be
confronted with decisions even his predecessor ducked.
Mr Portillo is determined he should take them. One of the small minority in
the cabinet whose ideological purpose has survived the crises of the past
year, the chief secretary has his sights on the long term. He believed in
shrinking the state long before the present crisis in public finances.
He is playing a skilful political game. His overhaul last year of the
framework for the spending negotiations - leaving the toughest decisions to
be thrashed out in a high-level ministerial committee and ultimately the
cabinet - have strengthened the Treasury's hand.
There is a now collective commitment to meeting the overall expenditure
ceilings set for 1994-95 and 1995-96. The credibility of the government as
well as what remains of that of the Treasury is at stake. Mr Portillo misses
no opportunity publicly to remind his colleagues of the point.
He has reinforced it privately by insisting their annual begging letters are
no longer framed in terms of bids for additional resources.
Before they can plead for more money, cabinet ministers must first submit
details of how they would implement notional cuts of 2.5 per cent and 5 per
cent respectively in their departmental budgets.
The ceilings are tougher than is generally realised. The new cash control
totals - Pounds 253.6bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 263.3bn in 1995-96 - were
originally designed to allow real increases in Whitehall spending of just
under 1 per cent a year.
But sterling's devaluation has obliged the Treasury to raise its forecast of
the medium-term inflation rate. The cash targets now imply small real cuts
in spending in each of the next two years. No new hospitals or police
stations there.
It is here we come to Mr Portillo's review of long-term expenditure - the
separate Whitehall studies of spending on the social security, the health,
the home office, the education and, less for-mally, the housing, budgets.
This exercise in thinking the unthinkable - lowering the social security
safety net, eroding the universality of the state pension and other
contributory benefits, expanding the revenue and contracting the service
base of the health service - has been carefully structured by the chief
secretary.
Each of the departments under review has been obliged to set up its own team
to produce options. The Treasury is represented on each of the teams. But
the onus is on the spending ministers to suggest, say, the introduction of
hospital hotel charges or the abolition of NHS dental care.
Everyone around the cabinet table is to be implicated.
The most radical options, of course, are for the next parliament. Even this
government will not trample on all its manifesto commitments. But by
bringing the issues out into the open Mr Portillo is nurturing carefully a
climate in which a significant start can be made next year.
Cutbacks in invalidity benefit and statutory sick pay or in the eligibility
for free NHS prescriptions are obvious examples. State-funding of university
fees is another target.
The chief secretary believes he has the mood of the party behind him.
Conservatives do not like runaway borrowing. They hate tax increases. If
they hold on to Newbury in next week's by-election they may judge that the
voters will accept anything.
Mr Portillo will have the opportunity to write Mr Major's agenda.

FT  29 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Budget national insurance bill
could face delay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LEGISLATION to implement one of the most contentious elements in last
month's Budget - the 1 per cent increase in national insurance contributions
 -could be delayed until the next session of parliament, even though the
rest of the Budget measures will have passed into law before the summer.
Ministers say that because the increase, taking employee contributions to 10
per cent, does not take effect until next April, there would be time to take
a bill through parliament in the new session which begins in November.
The Maastricht bill, on which there are two more days of detailed debate
next week, is still the priority for the government's business managers in
the current session, and they are not keen to take on another difficult
measure, at least until the final hurdles in the Maastricht legislation have
been cleared.
Other controversial aspects of the Budget will, however, be debated and
voted on by the Commons as a whole in the week after next.
The extension of value added tax to domestic fuel, the changes to the North
Sea tax regime, and the changes to income tax have been singled out for the
three days of detailed debate on the finance bill.
But the political sensitivity of the issue, both for the government and for
Tory backbenchers will be lessened, since the Commons debates will not be
held until immediately after the Newbury by-election and the county council
elections.
The first of the three days of more detailed debate on the finance bill will
be devoted solely to the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel.
The reform of petroleum revenue tax, on which ministers could face a
rebellion from some Tory backbenchers, will be the main element of the
second day, on which there will also be a separate debate on small
businesses. The third day will be dominated by the income tax changes and
there will also be debates on charities and on capital allowances.
Less politically contentious elements of the bill will be taken in a
36-strong cross-party committee of MPs. The committee will begin its
detailed consideration of the bill in the following week, and is not
expected to have finished its work until early July.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs yesterday expressed concern about the number of serving admirals in the
Royal Navy.
Ministry of Defence officials disclosed there were now 42 admirals, two more
than the total number of frigates and destroyers.
Mr Roger Jackling, deputy under-secretary for resources, programmes and
finance, insisted the number of admirals was being cut in proportion to the
rest of the Navy. He said independent assessors, including the Treasury, had
recently approved the numbers. The total number of admirals will be reduced
to 37 by April 1996.
Mr John Home-Robertson, Labour MP for East Lothian, said the committee
remained 'concerned' at the numbers.

Responding to written questions, Mr Thomas Sackville, health minister, said
this total included money made available for medical treatment and care,
training of health and social workers, infection control, blood supply
protection and other purposes.
Since 1986, 7,083 cases of Aids and 16,164 cases of HIV had been reported.

FT  29 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Alarm at level of drug bill for NHS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COST of drugs to the national health service was 'escalating at an
alarming rate,' Baroness Cumberlege, junior health minister, told the House
of Lords last night, Ivor Owen writes.
In defending the government's decision to consider adding new products to
the so-called selected list of drugs not available for prescription on the
NHS, she stressed that the pharmaceutical industry was being closely
consulted.
Lady Cumberlege rejected recent suggestions by Lord Jenkin of Roding (C), a
former health secretary, that the selected list system had not produced
worthwhile savings since its introduction.
She said it had produced savings of Pounds 75m in its first year of
operation but assured peers that the government was being 'more cautious' in
reaching conclusions about the addition of further categories of drugs.
Lady Cumberlege promised to study allegations by Lord Ashley of Stoke (Lab)
that a few pharmaceutical companies were offering inducements which resulted
in some family doctors prescribing unnecessary drugs for their patients.
Some drug trials, Lord Ashley said, were 'little more than drug company
promotions'.

FT  29 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pools concession may help lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday agreed to allow football pools companies to offer
larger jackpots in a move intended to allay some of the industry's fears
about the consequences of introducing a national lottery.
Bowing to cross-party pressure, Mr Peter Lloyd, a home office minister, said
there was 'a good case' for allowing pools companies to 'roll over' prize
money from one week to another under limited circumstances.
Mr Lloyd also told MPs the government intended to review restrictions on the
sale of lottery tickets in bingo clubs and other leisure outlets. It 'may
well' come back with proposals to amend existing rules which prohibit the
sale of tickets in betting shops, bingo clubs, casinos, and amusement
arcades, he said.
As the National Lottery Bill paving the way for the new lottery approached
its third Commons reading, Mr Lloyd said the government would bring forward
proposals to override the current prohibition on rolling over pools prize
money when the measure reached the Lords.
He said the proposals would be designed to give pools companies 'similar
freedom' to that granted to the national lottery, which he expected to roll
over its prize money once or twice a year.
Rejecting less restrictive proposals put forward by Sir Malcolm Thornton,
the Tory MP for Crosby, and supported by Labour, Mr Lloyd said these would
not create a level playing field and could result in 'spiralling jackpots'.
As part of its review of ticket sales restrictions, the government would
'give favourable consideration' to proposals submitted by Mr Peter Fry, the
Tory MP for Wellingborough, that would allow local lottery tickets to be
sold in bingo clubs.
It would be up to the organisations running the lotteries to decide where
their tickets should be sold if current restrictions were lifted, Mr Lloyd
said.
In the case of pubs, the government has said it will allow pub operators to
decide whether or not to sell lottery tickets.
Home office officials said the review would start 'within months'.
Earlier, MPs voted down by a majority of 90 (259 votes to 169) a proposal by
Mr David Alton, the Liberal Democrat MP for Liverpool Mossley Hill, that the
headquarters should be set up in an area that would suffer job losses
directly attributable to the lottery.

FT  29 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Police plead not guilty to terror
charges - Criticism of the City force
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BLUE lamp above the door of Wood Street Police station lends a Dock
Green atmosphere to the City police operational centre. The impression is
enhanced by the friendly village-bobby approach of the desk officers inside.
The desk is bereft of the toughened-glass cell-like fittings more readily
associated with the offices of the Metropolitan Police.
In character the two forces are chalk and cheese, and while the old
parochialism of the City force is not what it once was - its last four
Commissioners came from the Met - there is a scarcely veiled antipathy
towards each other.
Met officers will jokingly refer to their City counterparts as 'door
openers' because of the number of ceremonial duties demanded in the Square
Mile.
The Bishopsgate bomb has made that charge of amateurism a political issue.
And the City police are hard pressed to respond. Their normal defence is
their ability to tackle fraud, not terrorism.
The Company Fraud Department, which works closely with the Serious Fraud
Office, is the force's showcase squad.
In his foreword to the force's last annual report Mr Owen Kelly, the
commissioner, put forward unconventional though forceful argument that its
performance provided value for money.
Presenting a balance sheet for the City of London force, and excluding the
frauds in the Maxwell Group and at Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, he said the Company Fraud Department recovered or prevented
the loss of Pounds 936.1m.
A further Pounds 11m 'income' could be added from other sources such as
fixed penalty fines, giving a total of Pounds 947.1m. This compared with the
force's estimated spend of Pounds 47.4m in the 1991-92 financial year.
The report was compiled before the Baltic Exchange bomb and last weekend's
Bishopsgate blast which, using the profit/loss analogy, would have wiped the
smile off the balance sheet.
Met officers recognise City police skills at fraud investigation but few
seem willing to give any further praise. That now makes the force
vulnerable. One Metropolitan fraud squad detective said that he regarded the
City of London as a 'commercial police force'.
He said: 'In the Met it's a seven-day police operation, but the City
sometimes hasn't got cover at weekends. The City hasn't got the capacity for
dealing with terrorism.'
Arguments over the future of the City of London Police have led to renewed
debate over whether it should be amalgamated into another force  - this is
one possible area of discussion under the current Home Office review of the
organisation of forces in England and Wales.
At least twice in its history the City force has found itself the target of
amalagamation plans with other forces. On both occasions it has been
protected by its fairy godmother, the Corporation of London. The City force
said: 'Ever since we first started there has been talk of amalgamation, but
we are still here 150 years later.'
City police believe strongly that the bomb last weekend has unfairly focused
criticism on their operations, when they are in fact dependent on the
intelligence and logistical back-up provided by others.
'Before you blame us, you have to ask how it was allowed to get into our
area in the first place,' one City police source said.
This defensive position is based on the belief that an IRA operation that
was well under way when a lorry was stolen in Staffordshire on March 20
should have been detected not just by M15 but also by several other
constabularies before it reach its final parking place in Bishopsgate.
That argument has some force but it does not answer the charge that having
one extra small force, with little anti-terrorist expertise, compounds the
problems of communication of intelligence in a structure already unwieldy
because of the large number of constabularies.
If the Corporation of London wants to defend its police force it will need
more than value-for-money arguments.

FT  29 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lottery sale restrictions may be
eased
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESTRICTIONS on the sale of lottery tickets in bingo clubs and other leisure
outlets are to be reviewed, the government said yesterday, as the National
Lottery Bill approached its third Commons reading.
Mr Peter Lloyd, home office minister, told MPs he would undertake a
'complete review' of existing rules which prohibit the sale of tickets in
betting shops, bingo clubs, casinos, and amusement arcades.
The government 'may well' come back with proposals to amend the regulations,
Mr Lloyd said. In particular it would 'give favourable consideration' to
proposals submitted by Mr Peter Fry, the Tory MP for Wellingborough, that
would allow tickets for local lotteries to be sold in bingo clubs.
It would be up to the organisations running the lotteries to decide where
their tickets should be sold if current restrictions were lifted, Mr Lloyd
said.
In the case of pubs, the government has said it will allow pub operators to
decide whether or not to sell lottery tickets.
The Home Office said the review would start 'within months'. The government
was 'sympathetic' to the idea of tickets being sold in amusement arcades but
clearing the way for them to be sold in betting shops would require primary
legislation.
Earlier, Mr Robert Key, national heritage minister, gave an assurance that
the funds distributed by the national lottery - which is planned to start
next year - would not act as a substitute for public spending.
Mr Key refused to be drawn on where the headquarters for the lottery would
be located, except to say it would be in the UK.
MPs voted down by a majority of 90 (259 votes to 169) a proposal by Mr David
Alton, the Liberal Democrat MP for Liverpool Mossley Hill, that the
headquarters should be set up in an area that would suffer job losses
directly attributable to the lottery.
Liverpool MPs have repeatedly argued that the lottery will have seriously
adverse consequences for employment in the football pools industry which is
heavily based in Merseyside.

FT  29 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Home Secretary Clarke says
government considering security measures request
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, said yesterday that the government
was considering the request from the City of London for extra money to
improve security measures in the wake of the Bishopsgate bomb.
A similar request from Warrington is also being considered.
His comments came after he attended an hour-long meeting in Downing Street
with Mr John Major; Sir Francis McWilliams, the lord mayor of London; Mr
Paul Condon, the Metropolitan police commissioner; and Mr Owen Kelly, the
City of London police commissioner.
Downing Street said that the prime minister was in 'listening mode' and that
the object of the meeting was to learn the policing lessons from the events
leading up to the bomb, and its aftermath.
The security and intelligence aspects are being discussed separately between
Mr Major, Mr Clarke and Mrs Stella Rimington, the head of the security
service.
Six of the nine individuals arrested on Monday in connection with the City
bomb have been released, with the three remaining held without charge in
undisclosed police stations, Scotland Yard confirmed yesterday.

BRITAIN'S THREE largest travel companies say it would not be in their
interest to use their dominant position to shut out competitors.
Executives from Thomson, Owners Abroad and Airtours have told the
Association of British Travel Agents convention in Majorca that their travel
agents will continue to sell holidays from a large number of tour operators.
Mr David Crossland, chairman of Airtours, said yesterday that Pickfords
Travel, which he purchased last year, sold the holidays of hundreds of tour
operators and would continue to do so.
He admitted, however, that the decision to buy Pickfords from the transport
group NFC was partly motivated by a desire to ensure that Airtours did not
suffer at the hands of Thomson, the biggest travel company, and its Lunn
Poly retail chain.
Airtours and Lunn Poly have had disputes in the past over pricing and the
display of brochures.

FT  29 APR 93 / Gas companies urge wider competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK gas market could become fully competitive by 2000, which would cut 10
per cent off the cost of most residential gas bills and lead to savings of
Pounds 400m in the entire market, a plan put forward by three independent
gas marketing companies suggests.
Alliance Gas, Utilicorp UK and Total Gas Marketing propose in a report drawn
up by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand a timetable for the introduction of
competition to the domestic market by 1995 and a stringent system of
licensing for suppliers to households. The three companies say they would be
willing to agree to a price cap similar to that of British Gas and to set
service standards.
Mr Kristoffer Maroe, managing director of Alliance Gas, a joint venture
between British Petroleum and Norway's Statoil, dismissed claims by British
Gas that as many as 12m households would pay higher bills in a more open
market as propaganda. 'There are only winners,' he said.
Mr Peter Bryant, deputy chairman of Utilicorp UK - the UK arm of the US
utility, said: 'It's absolutely clear that the industry as a whole is very
dissatisfied with the current debate on gas. What is needed is a new
approach and a change of thinking.'
Total Gas Marketing is an offshoot of the French Total oil group. Between
them, the three companies have joint ventures with most of the UK's regional
electricity companies.
The Coopers report is to be submitted to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, which is looking at the structure of the gas industry and is due
to make its report by the end of July.
Mr Bryant said the commission's inquiry had not taken into account the way
in which competition could be introduced to households.
The three companies want to see a separation of British Gas's pipelines
network and marketing, but do not necessarily advocate a break-up of the
company.
Sir James McKinnon, the industry regulator, said the report 'demonstrates
that competitors are willing and able to shoulder the responsibilities of
serving a fully competitive market'. He called on British Gas to open up a
new dialogue on the future of the industry.
British Gas said that the right forum for debate was the MMC.

FT  29 APR 93 / Ministers clash on N Sea tax
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A ROW emerged yesterday between the Treasury and the Department of Trade and
Industry over proposed changes to the North Sea tax regime, which have
caused a furore in the oil industry.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, has clashed with Mr
Tim Eggar, energy minister, over the type of contracts that are eligible for
transitional relief under the petroleum revenue taxes changes proposed in
the Budget.
The new PRT regime, which would reduce the tax rate from 75 per cent to 50
per cent and abolish tax relief on exploration and appraisal work, provides
transitional help for companies which have already entered into contracts
with drilling contractors.
The industry says that obligations made to the DTI for new drilling as part
of previous oil licensing rounds should be classed as legal contracts -
automatically eligible for full tax relief - because companies are not able
to withdraw from them.
Mr Dorrell has disputed this interpretation. Mr Eggar, however, suggested
that the obligation contracts were binding.
Referring to the oil industry's drilling commitments to the DTI, Mr Eggar
added: 'There is no question of any blanket exemption.'
One leading North Sea explorer said: 'We've been getting very mixed messages
and that point certainly needs clarifying. We need to get relief or
release.'
The DTI yesterday published its 'brown book' of oil and gas statistics which
showed that the North Sea oil and gas industry contributed more than Pounds
10bn to the UK economy last year.
The industry drilled 131 exploration and appraisal wells last year. Oil
companies believe this figure could be halved if the government's proposed
changes to PRT were adopted in their present form.
Mr Eggar said the DTI had contacted companies which had made applications
for licences to drill in the North Sea as part of the 14th licensing round
but very few companies had changed their plans in the wake of the tax
changes.
The North Sea had a record 113 fields in production and the success rate for
oil exploration had improved significantly, he said.
One well in every 3.6 drilled found oil or gas, compared with a world
average of one in 20 wells. Oil production increased to 94.2m tonnes last
year from 91.3m tonnes in 1991.
Mr Eggar said forecasts for oil output suggested it would rise and reach
record levels over the next four years.
Oil discoveries reached 230m tonnes last year - taking proven and probable
reserves of oil to 2.9bn tonnes - enough to last for nearly 30 years at
present production rates.
Gas discoveries last year reached 165bn cu m.

FT  29 APR 93 / Repossessions fall adds to housing hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COURT ORDERS to repossess mortgaged houses fell 2.7 per cent in the first
quarter of the year, compared with the previous quarter. Figures released
yesterday show they were at their lowest level since the second quarter of
1990.
The figures suggest a slowly recovering housing market but analysts pointed
out that the fall appeared to be flattening out. Mr John Wriglesworth of
UBS, the stockbroker, said he still expected 70,000 repossessions this year,
compared with 69,000 last year.
The reduction in repossession orders to 26,910 from 27,656 in the final
quarter of last year was the fifth consecutive quarterly fall. The number of
orders - not all of which end in repossession - was 24 per cent lower than
the number in the first quarter of last year.
Mr Wriglesworth said the fall in repossession orders did not necessarily
indicate that fewer people were having difficulty with mortgage repayments.
Building societies had 352,000 properties more than six months in arrears at
the end of last year and the fall in orders probably indicated that more
borrowers were being allowed to go more than a year into arrears.
The number of actions initiating repossession proceedings rose to 31,371
compared with 29,583 in the last quarter of last year. They were well down
on the 42,267 in last year's first quarter, according to the Lord
Chancellor's Department.
Mr Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell, said that financing
house purchase through variable interest rate mortgages had contributed to
the volatility of the UK economy. Fixed-rate mortgages would damp down
swings in the mortgage interest rate, reducing the size of the boom and the
length of the slump.
He also warned that it would be hard for sterling to return to the European
Exchange Rate Mechanism unless a higher proportion of mortgages were on
fixed rates.

FT  29 APR 93 / Nissan Motor 'may be at heart of fraud'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN MOTOR Corporation, the Japanese carmaker, may have been at the centre
of a multi-million-pound international tax fraud, it was alleged at the Old
Bailey yesterday.
The claim was made by Mr Michael Sherrard QC, counsel for Mr Michael Hunt, a
director of Nissan UK, the former importer of the Japanese cars, who is
accused of conspiring to defraud the Inland Revenue of Pounds 97m in
corporation tax.
The prosecution has said that Mr Hunt conspired to cheat the Inland Revenue
by dishonestly inflating freight charges to avoid tax, then laundering the
money into Swiss bank accounts. Mr Hunt denies the charge.
In a statement outlining Mr Hunt's defence Mr Sherrard told the jury: 'Keep
your eyes and ears open for signs of a Japanese fraud.'
He went on: 'We suggest that Nissan Motor Corporation of Japan and/or its
subsidiary, Nissan Motor Corporation Carriers, may well have been right at
the centre of a self-serving tax fraud by which the profits on the freight
side were kept down and the equivalent of corporation tax in Japan reduced.
'You may well reach the conclusion that vast sums of cash were kept outside
Japan, probably for the benefit of the corporation's business interests
elsewhere in the world.'
A number of signposts of the Japanese involvement had emerged since the
Inland Revenue started its investigation into Nissan UK, the company set up
by Mr Octav Botnar.
The prosecution had claimed that in the early 1980s Nissan UK had changed
the shipping agents that were party to the alleged fraud, Mr Sherrard said.
The introduction to the second company of shipping agents had been made by a
Japanese employee of Nissan Motor Corporation, he said.
The prosecution had already said sophisticated fraudsters might seek to
cover their tracks, he continued. In this case, there was much
documentation, but a dearth of evidence from Japan.
Mr Sherrard said a crucial question in the trial would be who controlled the
two Swiss bank accounts where the money allegedly siphoned out of Nissan UK
was eventually deposited.
The jury would hear that a senior figure in Nissan Motor Corporation
Carriers had told the Dutch authorities that the money in those accounts
belonged to Japan, he said.
The trial continues today.

FT  29 APR 93 / Walker bankrupt with Pounds 180m debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GEORGE Walker, former chairman and chief executive of the Brent Walker,
the property and leisure group, was declared bankrupt with debts of Pounds
180m yesterday after a High Court judge accused him of taking a 'cavalier'
attitude towards his creditors.
In September Mr Walker, who has also been charged by the Serious Fraud
Office with the theft of Pounds 12m from the company and false accounting,
reached a voluntary arrangement with his creditors, mainly TSB and other
banks and the Inland Revenue, to repay some of the debt.
No money has been repaid to date and Sir Donald Nicholls, the
vice-chancellor, yesterday granted a request from accountants Stoy Hayward,
the supervisors of the voluntary arrangement, for it to be ended and
replaced by a bankruptcy order.
Sir Donald singled out two aspects of Mr Walker's finances which indicated
that the former Brent Walker head was 'not playing fair with his creditors'.
Mr Walker had provided no explanation of the affairs of Walkers
International SA, a Monaco-based business which exports tobacco to Russia.
His wife, Mrs Jean Walker, is the company chairman and receives a monthly
salary of USDollars 5,000 (Pounds 3,164). Mr Walker is a director, but draws
no salary.
Sir Donald said Mr Walker had not explained his substantial travel expenses
incurred working for the company. This suggested that money was being
diverted from Mr Walker to his wife, who has no obligations to repay any
money to his creditors.
He also criticised Mr and Mrs Walker's handling of the Pounds 214,000
compensation paid to her by Brent Walker after she left the company.
Acting on Mr Walker's advice, she returned the cheque to Brent Walker so
that the money, with a further Pounds 24,000, could be paid into her pension
account. This placed it out of her reach, leaving her unable to use the
money to fund two legal actions which she had promised to pay for under the
voluntary arrangement.
Sir Donald said: 'When, in those circumstances, she, with the assistance of
her husband, puts a very substantial sum out of her reach, I am left gravely
troubled about the genuineness of her and his commitment to the spirit and
terms of the voluntary arrangement.'
An affidavit about these arrangements submitted to the court by Mr Michael
Coleman of Harkavy's, Mr Walker's solicitors, had been 'highly misleading',
he added.
Under the voluntary arrangement, an alternative to bankruptcy introduced by
the Insolvency Act 1986, Mr Walker had agreed to pay creditors half his
disposable income. He originally estimated he would earn Pounds 100,000 this
year.
Although he has since earned some money - from property rentals - Mr Walker
has not submitted detailed accounts of his expenses to the voluntary
arrangement supervisors.
The bulk of the money to be repaid was expected to come from legal actions
against Brent Walker and others, the proceeds of which would be passed to
creditors. In one of these - a claim for Pounds 14.5m - very little progress
had been made, Sir Donald said. The other actions have also yet to start
since Mrs Walker has yet to fund the legal costs involved as she promised
under the voluntary arrangement.
After the hearing Mr Walker issued a statement through his solicitor, saying
he was deeply disappointed by the ruling.
Mr Coleman said: 'Under the provisions of the voluntary arrangement, whilst
there was no guarantee, there was a reasonable prospect of creditors
receiving some of the money owed to them.
'As a result of the bankruptcy, it is unlikely they will receive a single
penny. How this benefits shareholders of the dissenting creditors it is
difficult to see.'

FT  29 APR 93 / Investors write off holdings in Accountancy TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS representing 40 per cent of the shares in Accountancy Television,
the late-night BBC weekly subscription programme produced by and for
accountants, have written off their holdings.
The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants says in its 1992 annual
report, released yesterday, that it has written off its entire Pounds
250,000 stake. Earlier this year BPP Holdings, a financial training company
which holds shares worth Pounds 350,000, took similar action.
Mr David Bishop, president of the certified accountants, said his
organisation's policy was always to write off educational projects of this
sort, although the accounts do not make that statement.
BPP's write-off reflected what the company called 'a high-risk venture whose
future must be regarded as uncertain during this early critical period'.
Accountancy TV, which is broadcast by BBC Select, the late-night
subscription service, started broadcasting in October and has run into
several setbacks.
Mr Mike Lickiss, chairman of the company and a senior partner in Grant
Thornton, the accountancy firm, confirmed that the service was Pounds
300,000 behind projections.
He said he was still confident about the company but it would not make
profits until the end of 1994, at least six months beyond last year's
projections.
The other main BBC Select services for people in business and lawyers seem
to be going considerably better.
Mr Peter Brindley, chief executive of Legal Network Television, launched in
February, said last night: 'We are ahead of target. We have had a very good
launch.'
The company, whose shareholders are the College of Law, BBC Select and the
Law Society, broadcasts two half-hour programmes a week.
Mr Roy Bass, marketing director of the Executive Business Club, which was
launched 10 months ago, said the service had taken Pounds 1.5m in
subscriptions and was on target.
Mr John Radcliffe, managing director of BBC Select, said he was happy with
progress but conceded that the recession had made it more difficult to raise
money for new services.
Total shareholdings in Accountancy TV are Pounds 1.5m. The other investors
are BBC Select, the three chartered accountancy bodies covering the UK and
Ireland, and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants.
There were initial differences between the five professional accountancy
bodies over the level of coverage provided to each of them. Difficulties
with the broadcast technology meant the company had to distribute some of
its early programmes by videotape.
In spite of initial optimistic projections that the company had attracted
interest from 11,000 potential subscribers, only a few more than 600 have
signed up.

FT  29 APR 93 / Workplace pensions are less popular
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROPORTION of employees who belong to an occupational pension scheme has
been falling, according to the 1991 General Household Survey published
today.
The survey shows that the proportion of full-time employees who were members
of their employer's pension scheme fell from 61 per cent in 1988 to 59 per
cent in 1991.
The fall was entirely accounted for by a decline in pension-scheme
membership among full-time male employees from 64 per cent to 61 per cent
during the period. Membership among full-time women employees remained
stable at 55 per cent, and rose for women part-timers.
The survey found higher earners were more likely to belong to an
occupational pension scheme than the low-paid. Membership of employers'
pension schemes tended to rise with age and service.
Three quarters of full-time professionals belonged to an occupational
pension scheme, compared with 44 per cent of unskilled manual workers.
The survey includes details about membership of personal pension schemes for
the first time. Among employees, 25 per cent of men and 15 per cent of women
were members of such personal pension schemes in 1991.
Among the self-employed, membership of personal pension schemes was much
higher, at 63 per cent for men and 30 per cent for women.
Few employers appeared willing to contribute to personal pension schemes -
85 per cent of male full-time employees received no contribution from their
employer.
The survey presents annual data on population characteristics, households
and families, marriage, economic activity, education, health and housing.

FT  29 APR 93 / Jordan forecasts new strike wave
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC RECOVERY could be accompanied by 'a return to industrial disputes
of a combative kind' such as the bitter dispute at Timex in Dundee, Mr Bill
Jordan, the president of the AEEU engineering union, warned last night.
He told the Commons employment committee that trade union and individual
worker rights had dramatically worsened over the past 14 years.
Throughout the 13-week Timex dispute, he said, his union had fully complied
with the law but appeared to be 'not one inch nearer a settlement'.
The union has been seeking a negotiated agreement with Timex over the
reinstatement of 341 workers dismissed nearly three months ago for refusing
to accept new terms and conditions of employment.
Mr Jordan said the union agreed with Timex's aim of turning its lossmaking
plant into profit and urged the company to join the union in calling in the
conciliation service Acas to try to resolve the dispute.
Timex said in its evidence it wanted to see a toughening in the labour laws.
Mass picketing should be turned into a criminal offence, it said.
In its written submission the company said that controlling picketing by a
voluntary code of practice would 'continue to be ineffective'.
It said it had not been able to use the law against outsiders who came to
picket because it had failed to establish their identity.
Mr Peter Hall, the company's chief executive, said there had been widespread
violence during the dispute.
The company said the present labour laws had made it impossible to change
its workers' contracts of employment without going through a 12-week notice
period, which it claimed would have jeopardised its financial survival.
Mr Hall said that the company would reconsider its position on May 17, which
would be 90 days after the workers were sacked. Under existing law a company
cannot rehire workers who have lost their jobs in a mass dismissal without
facing claims of unfair dismissal by those not offered re-employment.
Mr Greville Janner, the Labour MP who chairs the select committee, appealed
to Mr Hall to settle the dispute. 'Could you not reconsider the situation
having heard what the union had to say?' he asked. Mr Hall said: 'We have
stated our position and that is that.'

FT  29 APR 93 / Family Assurance status move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAMILY ASSURANCE has become the first friendly society to apply to become a
corporate body under new legislation allowing societies to extend their
range of financial services.
Friendly societies grew out of the co-operative movement, providing
protection for workers against sickness and unemployment. Investment by
individuals in societies' tax-free savings schemes is limited to Pounds 200
a year.
Under the Friendly Societies Act 1992, designed to allow them to compete
more effectively with other providers of financial services, societies can
incorporate and offer their members and the public a variety of financial
services, including unit trusts and personal equity plans, insurance broking
and fund management services for pension funds.
Family Assurance, which has Pounds 600m funds under management, has secured
the approval of its members to become a corporate body and expects to
incorporate on July 1. It said yesterday it is to acquire Family Equity
Plan, a company limited by guarantee which manages a unit trust, to market
Peps to its 530,000 members and the public.
Liverpool Victoria, the largest friendly society with Pounds 2.7bn under
management, said it intended to incorporate after choosing the most suitable
products to market. It said: 'There is a danger that you could leap in and
then find you are in the wrong place.'
Mr Peter Gray, chief executive of Tunbridge Wells Equitable friendly
society, said the society would be putting the question of incorporation to
its members at its annual meeting in October.

FT  29 APR 93 / Halifax seeks sales breakthrough by loosening its ties: An
unexpected application to the Personal Investment Authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DESIRE of the Halifax, by far Britain's largest building society, to
join the proposed Personal Investment Authority could be a breakthrough.
It is the first building society to say it wants to join the proposed
umbrella regulatory body overseeing the sale of retail financial products,
and it cites its commercial interest in doing so.
The pay-off for the society is a chance to lobby for a change to the
polarisation rule, part of the Financial Services Act, which requires sales
agents either to be tied - selling the products of a single supplier - or to
be independent - selling the best product of a range of suppliers.
Chief executive Mr Jim Birrell said: 'The Halifax thinks of itself as a
retailer.' He added that he would like to emulate Marks and Spencer. 'If
you're a retailer, you should deal with a number of suppliers - more than
one for each mainline product.'
Apart from deposit-based products the Halifax sells no retail financial
services of its own. It is a 'tied agent' of Standard Life, one of Britain's
largest life insurers.
After a brief flirtation with independent status the Halifax opted to be
tied Life because 'the remuneration is better as a tied agent', Mr Birrell
said.
For the Halifax the tie brought in Pounds 177m in commissions, contributing
handsomely to the group's total profit of Pounds 680m for 1992. And while
Standard Life will not say how much of its business comes through the
Halifax, industry estimates are that it accounts for about a quarter of all
new policies sold.
But what if Standard Life does not offer a product which Halifax customers
want? Or if the product it does offer is not as good as others in the
market?
Mr Birrell says he has no desire to change his relationship with Standard
Life but 'there are other sectors of the financial services market where
Standard Life is not the best provider'.
He hopes membership of the new self-regulatory body will expand his range of
options. The body is to be formed by merging Lautro, the life insurance
industry regulatory body, and Fimbra, the body for independent financial
advisers, as well as the large independent financial adviser members of
Imro, the self-regulatory body for fund managers.
The life insurers have said they will not join, however, unless the retail
financial services arms of banks and building societies become members as
well.
As a tied agent Halifax does not need to be a member of a self-regulatory
body. It is regulated indirectly by Lautro, which oversees the sales
activities of Standard Life. If a Halifax-based sales agent breaks the rules
it is Standard Life which has to compensate clients.
But Mr Birrell says he wants to see the new body get off the ground. 'We
feel encouraged with the way it is shaping up and we thought it worthwhile
to say so,' he said.
Last December Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments
Board, told the new body's formation committee that he would not approve it
as a self-regulatory body unless it significantly improved investor
protection and incorporated certain specific rules.
He has also proposed rules that could force the most marginal independent
financial advisers out of business, and limit claims on the Investors'
Compensation Scheme.
That tough stance, and signs that the new body's board is taking it
seriously, has encouraged Mr Birrell.
But he admits to his other agenda - to change the regulatory structure to
allow the Halifax and other building societies to expand the range of retail
products that they can sell.
The issue is unnerving several of Britain's largest life insurance
companies, most of which have invested heavily in developing a building
society tie. Industry sources said the Halifax had sought membership of the
new body by approaching its formation committee, only to be rebuffed by the
life insurance members.
Mr Birrell says that because the banks and building societies failed to
inject themselves sufficiently into the debate over the shape of regulation
in the years leading up to the passage of the Financial Services Act in 1987
and did not join the self-regulatory bodies thereafter, they limited their
ability to influence regulation.
'We have been disadvantaged in the initial discussions. We would like a seat
at the table and the ability to influence events,' he said. 'We are a
significant part of the life insurance industry and we haven't been able to
influence regulation.'

FT  29 APR 93 / Superdrug intensifies high street price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPERDRUG intensified its price war against rival high street retailers
yesterday by announcing an immediate 25 per cent price cut on two thirds of
all branded sun-care products sold in its 680 shops.
Prices of the remaining third of such products will be reduced by a quarter
in the next few weeks. The price cuts will remain in force through the
summer.
This latest shot in the battle for the sun-care products market - worth
Pounds 110m at retail prices - follows Boots' April 24 attempt to obtain an
injunction preventing Superdrug, a part of the Kingfisher group, from
selling its new Solait range of products.
Boots said that Superdrug's Solait was in several respects an imitation of
its own sun-care range, called Soltan. A legal hearing is likely in the next
few weeks.
The sun-care price war extends the battle between Superdrug and Boots over
fragrances. Superdrug said it achieved a 1.5 per cent market share in the
fine fragrance market - worth a total Pounds 450m at retail prices - last
year.

who sign personal contracts giving up trade union rights. A Daily Mail
journalist and a ship's bosun claim they were unlawfully discriminated
against when they were excluded from pay rises after refusing to sign.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE IN FIVE of the world's tankers is below international safety standards,
the inquiry into the implications of January's Braer tanker disaster heard
yesterday.
The Chamber of Shipping, which represents UK owners and operators, told the
inquiry that it blamed cut-throat pricing, and accused governments of
lacking the resources and the will to police ship safety properly.
It said freight rates had fallen in real terms from a 1973 peak of Dollars
69.4 a tonne to less than Dollars 12 a tonne in 1991. The chamber said a
'significant number of owners' were willing to cut corners on safety because
of inadequate inspection by flag and port states, while some charterers did
not care about the state of vessels.
Inspections by oil companies had shown that '20 per cent or more of the
world's tankers do not meet existing internationally agreed standards'. The
inquiry continues.

FT  29 APR 93 / Superdrug intensifies high street price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPERDRUG intensified its price war against rival high street retailers
yesterday by announcing an immediate 25 per cent price cut on two-thirds of
all branded sun-care products sold in its 680 shops.
Prices of the remaining third of such products will be reduced by a quarter
in the next few weeks. The price cuts will remain in force through the
summer.
This latest shot in the sun-care products market battle - worth Pounds 110m
at retail prices - follows Boots' April 24 attempt to obtain an injunction
preventing Superdrug, a part of the Kingfisher group, selling its rival's
new Solait range of products.
Boots said that Superdrug's Solait was in several respects an imitation of
its own sun-care range, called Soltan. A legal hearing to decide on the
injunction is likely in the next few weeks.
Profit margins on sun-care products, like brand-name perfumes, are as high
as 50 per cent in some retailers.
The sun-care price war extends that being fought out between Superdrug and
Boots on fine fragrances. In April 1992 Superdrug made a formal complaint to
the Office of Fair Trading about alleged restrictive pricing and supplies in
the brand-name perfume market.
The OFT referred the matter to the Mergers and Monopolies Commission, which
is expected to rule by September.
Superdrug said yesterday that its experience was that consumers bought much
more perfume when it brought down the retail price - by between 15 per cent
and 50 per cent - in the approach to last Christmas.
Superdrug said it had achieved a 1.5 per cent market share in the fine
fragrance market - worth a total Pounds 450m at retail prices - last year.
It is aiming at similar target in the sun-care market.

FT  29 APR 93 / 20% of tankers 'below safety standards'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE IN FIVE of the world's tankers is below international safety standards,
the inquiry into the implications of the Braer tanker disaster heard
yesterday.
The Chamber of Shipping, which represents UK owners and operators, giving
evidence to the inquiry, blamed cut-throat pricing and accused governments
of lacking the resources and the will to police ship safety properly.
It said freight rates had fallen in real terms from a 1973 peak of Dollars
69.4 a tonne to less than Dollars 12 a tonne in 1991. The chamber said a
'significant number of owners' were willing to cut corners on safety because
of inadequate inspection by flag and port states, while some charterers did
not care about the state of vessels.
Inspections by oil companies had shown that '20 per cent or more of the
world's tankers do not meet existing internationally agreed standards. The
operators of these ships need to be driven out of business or compelled to
bring their operations up to current international standards'.
Accident rates were increasing after declining between 1975 and 1989.
Companies found it difficult to justify replacing old ships 'in the current
economic climate' even though they needed higher maintenance. The chamber
also warned of a coming shortage of officers.
Captain James Irvine, from Shell, one of the chamber witnesses, accused ship
safety regulators - including the Department of Transport - of 'lacking the
resources and determination' to keep sub-standard vessels from ports in the
UK and elsewhere.
Asked by Lord Donaldson, the inquiry chairman, if one solution to the
inspection problem might be to recruit former mariners to carry out safety
checks, Capt Irvine said this would make 'an incalculable contribution to
safety'.
The chamber said better enforcement of regulations was needed before
additional rules on routeing or ship design.
But the chamber has said it favours greater use of high-tech navigational
aids, including satellite positioning systems, and the fitting of ships with
transponders to help ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore communications.
The inquiry continues.

FT  29 APR 93 / Polly Peck's auditors to face writ for damages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ADMINISTRATORS to Polly Peck, the fruit to electronics group owned by Mr
Asil Nadir, are to proceed with legal action against the company's auditors.
Mr Christopher Morris, joint administrator and a partner in accountants
Touche Ross, confirmed yesterday that action against Stoy Hayward, Polly
Peck's auditors from 1980 till the company entered administration in October
1990, was 'inevitable'.
Mr Morris said: 'We believe there is a significant degree of liability
attaching to the auditors for not qualifying the accounts of Polly Peck,
which have now transpired to be grossly inaccurate.'
Accountants at Ernst &amp; Young have recently completed a report commissioned
by the administrators which examines the conduct of the company's auditors.
The writ is likely to claim damages and interest against losses to
creditors, but may not claim a specific sum.
Mr Morris said total deficiencies during Polly Peck's corporate life were
Pounds 371m.
Mr Adrian Martin, managing partner of Stoy Hayward, said: 'Stoy Hayward has
not been served with a writ and is unaware of any specific claims from the
administrators. Any litigation arising from this case will be strenuously
defended.'
Mr Morris lodged a writ in December 1991 which claims damages from Stoy
Hayward for 'negligence and/or breach of contractual duty of care' in the
preparation of Polly Peck's accounts for the year to December 20 1985. He
said that writ was still 'live'.

SOUTH Korea breached fair trade rules in an anti-dumping investigation of
imports of polyacetal resins from the US and Japan, according to an
independent disputes panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
South Korea said it would implement the panel's recommendations to conform
with the world trade body's anti-dumping code. The code covers procedures
for identifying and levying duties on dumped imports - goods sold below cost
or below prices in the home market.
The anti-dumping investigation by the Korean trade commission led to the
imposition of duties in 1991 on US and Japanese exports of polyacetal
resins, a plastic widely used in the manufacture of audio and video tapes,
car parts and electronic components. Dumping margins were assessed at
between 20 and 108 per cent.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO yesterday imposed final duties of 2 to 81 per cent on three types of
US steel that were allegedly being dumped in Mexico below cost.
The move follows recent duties of up to 1,000 per cent on Chinese goods
allegedly sold below cost, and reflects a new willingness by Mexico to use
its trade laws to keep out subsidised exports.
The government will impose duties of 4 per cent to 40 per cent for rolled
steel plate, 18 per cent to 38 per cent for hot-rolled steel sheet, and 2
per cent to 13 per cent for cold-rolled steel sheet. The announcement
follows an official investigation,concluded in February.
Mr Pedro Noyola, the under-minister for foreign commerce, said the decision
to impose duties was not connected with similar duties brought against
Mexican steel by the US - which have still be made final. Mr Noyola said
provisional duties from 5 to 81 per cent would be applied to galvanised
sheet, but no final decision had been made in this case.
He hinted that more dumping cases might be brought. 'In as much as other
complaints justify the presumption of dumping practices (and) harm to
national production. . . . the trade ministry may open new cases against
other foreign exporters,' he said.

<TEXT>
CAHORA BASSA, the Zambesi dam in north-west Mozambique which supplied
electricity to South Africa in the 1970s, aims to export its hydroelectric
power there again, and to neighbouring Zimbabwe, within three years.
The link with the South African grid was destroyed during the long civil war
in Mozambique. However, work on restoring it is now expected to start within
about six months, according to Mr Manuel Lopez de Costa, Portuguese
ambassador in Maputo.
He was speaking after a two-day meeting of the tripartite Cahora Bassa
permanent commission, which comprises Mozambique, Portugal and South Africa.
He put the cost at Dollars 125m (Pounds 81m), of which Dollars 50m would be
provided by South Africa. Portugal and Italy would also contribute to the
project. It was hoped the line would be functioning again by 1996.
Work on rebuilding the 1,800 pylons along 300km of line destroyed during the
war could provide employment for hundreds of unskilled workers, including
soldiers demobbed from government Frelimo and rebel Renamo forces.
The Mozambique and Zimbabwe electricity authorities have also issued three
invitations to tender for contracts to build a high-voltage line between
Cahora Bassa and the Zimbabwe grid. The first is for the extension of
electricity substations at Bindura and Doma, near Mhangura in northeast
Zimbabwe, and the second is for the extension of Songo substation in
Mozambique.
The third is for the construction of a single high-voltage line linking the
three substations. Bids must be submitted by mid-June.
France is reported to have offered to finance 20 per cent of the estimated
Dollars 140m cost, with Scandinavia, Italy and the European Investment Bank
also providing funds.

Telecom by the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, said Mr Stefanescu. German and French suppliers had also
offered credits exceeding Dollars 85m for switching equipment made in
Romania.
He said the main goals for the next three years included installation of
500,000 telephone lines and 5,000km of fibre-optic cable, setting up a
private television channel and obtaining 5,000-10,000 mobile phone
subscribers.

SOUTH Korea breached fair trade rules in an anti-dumping investigation of
imports of polyacetal resins from the US and Japan, according to the report
of an independent disputes panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
At a meeting of Gatt's anti-dumping committee, which ended yesterday South
Korea said it would implement the panel's recommendations to conform with
the world trade body's anti-dumping code. The code covers procedures for
identifying and levying duties on dumped imports - goods sold below cost or
below prices in the home market.
The anti-dumping investigation by the Korean trade commission led to the
imposition of duties in 1991 on US and Japanese exports of polyacetal
resins, a plastic widely used in the manufacture of audio and video tapes,
car parts and electronic components. Dumping margins were assessed at
between 20 and 108 per cent.
The findings of another panel report, on US anti-dumping duties levied on
Norwegian salmon, were rejected by Norway after the panel cleared the US of
most of the alleged code violations. Washington said it was prepared to
implement the panel findings, which urged changes in US methods of
calculating dumping margins.

FT  29 APR 93 / World Trade News: Zimbabwe opens the door to investment -
Business welcome for new strategy is tinged with disappointment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BUSINESS leaders in Zimbabwe have given a cautious welcome to the package of
investment and export incentives announced by the government this week but
warn that the country has a long way to go before it will be competitive in
attracting global investment.
The government's new strategy was set out on Tuesday by Mr Bernard Chidzero,
finance minister. He liberalised dividend remittance regulations, increased
the level of export retentions from 35 to 50 per cent, widened the scope for
using blocked and surplus funds and - for the first time since exchange
controls were imposed more than 30 years ago - opened the door to foreign
portfolio investment through the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange.
There is some disappointment that the relaxation of the ceiling on dividend
remittances applies only to new investments after May 1 1993 or to companies
whose exports comprise more than a quarter of their total sales.
Mr Chidzero announced that any new foreign investment from next week would
be entitled to unrestricted remittance of dividends provided the funds are
bought in the Export Retention Market (ERS), where the premium is currently
28 per cent above the official rate of ZDollars 6.40 to the US dollar.
The related proposal to allow existing investors - either the pre-1979
companies (at present allowed to remit only 25 per cent of dividends) or
post-1979 foreign-owned concerns (currently limited to 50 per cent) - to
increase their dividend remittances in line with new investment is an
important concession, too. But many businessmen had hoped the government
would scrap these ceilings altogether and allow existing companies to remit
as much as they wished, provided the funds were purchased in the ERS or
'free' market.
The aim is to encourage existing foreign investors to reinvest in the
knowledge that they will be able to remit all profits derived from new
investment.
But it will be difficult to separate out profits generated from past and
'new' investment, and as one businessman said yesterday: 'The main
beneficiaries are going to be accountants, tax lawyers and consultants.'
The scope for using blocked and so-called 'surplus' funds, which foreign
companies have been unable to remit because of exchange control has been
widened, to allow Zimbabwe investors to purchase blocked funds and invest
them in new projects provided these export at least 75 per cent of turnover.
Also any new investment in Zimbabwe since 1979 may now be repatriated - by
way of disinvestment - provided the funds are bought in the ERS.
Foreign investors will now be allowed to buy equities on the Zimbabwe Stock
Exchange provided the funds are brought into the country through normal bank
channels. However, no single foreign investor will be allowed to purchase
more than 5 per cent of a quoted company and foreign ownership through
portfolio investment of this kind will be restricted to 25 per cent of the
total issued capital.

FT  29 APR 93 / World Trade News: China pushes to join Gatt in EC talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO DAYS of high-level talks between the European Community and China opened
yesterday, with the Chinese pressing their case for membership of the
General Agreement on Tariffs on Trade and the EC expressing concern about
Beijing's growing trade surplus.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic relations, and Mr
Hans van den Broek, commissioner for external political relations, are to
take part in the second plenary phase of talks today. The future of Hong
Kong will also be on the agenda, a Brussels official said.
The EC's dilemma is how to encourage economic reform in China as a catalyst
to political reform, while at the same time defending its markets against
what it considers unfair competition.
EC officials said yesterday that China's trade surplus with the EC had risen
to 'worrying levels', increasing from Ecu1.2bn (Pounds 940m) in 1988 to an
estimated Ecu10bn at the end of 1992. 'The deficit is still growing, while
EC exports have stagnated since 1986,' said one Brussels official.
Last month, the EC took action to protect Community bicycle-makers from
alleged 'dumping' by Chinese producers using unfairly low prices.
It announced it would set duties at 34.4 per cent of the net price before
customs clearance, following evidence that imports of racing, mountain and
other bikes had more than tripled to 2.1m - or 10 per cent of the EC market.
The Community has also sought to block toys and footwear imports.
The Chinese are anxious to avoid these kind of bilateral trade pressures
through Gatt membership.
But an EC official stressed yesterday that China's import regime fell well
short of free market principles. 'This will be of prime concern to the
Community and other contracting parties during accession negotiations to the
Gatt.'
The EC pledged to hold 'a frank dialogue' with the Chinese on human rights
as part of a progressive normalisation of political relations. This policy
follows the suspension of high-level contacts and a freeze on co-operation
in June 1989 after the Tienanmen Square massacre which lasted until October
1990.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH oilseed growers were told yesterday they must accept provisionally
the production restraint negotiated by the European Commission and the US
last autumn, but rejected by France's previous Socialist government.
Mr Jean-Claude Sabin, president of the Federation des Producteurs Oleagineux
et Protagineux (FOP), said he was ready to accept the limit of 5.128m
hectares for EC oilseed cultivation, provisionally agreed by EC and US
negotiators in Washington last November. The French government had
complained that this was incompatible with Brussels' predictions that the
internal Community farm policy reform would leave oilseed growers with 5.4m
hectares to cultivate.
But Mr Sabin said acceptance of the overall deal was dependent on the US
dropping two other aspects: a minimum 10 per cent set-aside, and a 1m tonne
limit on the growing of oilseeds for industrial use. It was not acceptable
that Europe should be committed to a 10 per cent set-aside on oilseeds,
without the flexibility to alter the amount of land taken out of production
as foreseen for other crops in the EC's own farm reform.
He also insisted that the growing of oilseeds to produce motor fuels - an
increasingly promising prospect in Europe as well as in the US - would have
no effect on world agricultural markets, and therefore should not be subject
to any limit.
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's new government has indicated that while it
would maintain France's firm resistance to the provisional EC-US accord on
subsidised exports, it is ready to be flexible on oilseeds, where the EC had
twice had its present support criticised within the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.

FT  29 APR 93 / Reforms planned to improve success rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank will introduce reforms to try to reverse a steady
deterioration in the success rate of its projects, Mr Lewis Preston, the
bank's president, said yesterday.
Mr Preston was referring to the findings of an internal review of project
performance by a task-force headed by Mr Willi Wapenhans, a senior bank
official.
The Wapenhans report, which the bank has not yet published, found 'a gradual
but steady deterioration in the World Bank's portfolio performance.'
The number of projects 'judged unsatisfactory at completion' had risen from
15 per cent in fiscal 1981 to 30.5 per cent in fiscal 1989 and 37.5 per cent
in fiscal 1991.
It said problems were concentrated in Africa and Latin America but other
regions 'also had 30-40 per cent of problem projects in their 4-5 year old
portfolios.'
Mr Preston said he was 'disturbed' by the report because it meant
implementation of bank projects 'was not what it should be.'
However, he said critics misunderstood the meaning of the failure rate. It
was high partly because the bank set an ambitious standard for success: a 10
per cent economic rate of return. Projects that failed to meet this criteria
need not be a 'failure in terms of development.'
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, underscored the point in
congressional testimony this week and said he would press for prompt
remedial action.

FT  29 APR 93 / UK defiant over Californian tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN and the US are heading towards a confrontation in the long-running
dispute over California's system for taxing foreign companies.
The British government still wants to resolve the issue in talks with the US
administration, but Mr John Major, the prime minister, is under mounting
pressure from backbench MPs and from business to take a much tougher line.
Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, was due to raise the issue in
Washington last night with Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary.
Sir Michael Grylls, chairman of the Conservative backbench committee on
trade and industry, has warned that the Clinton administration's 'appalling'
decision not to file a brief in support of Barclays Bank, whose suit is the
test case on California's system of taxation, 'leaves the British government
with no credible option but immediately to retaliate'.
California's system of worldwide unitary taxation assesses taxes on
companies not on the profits they actually make in the state, but on a
proportion of their worldwide earnings.
Barclays has won several rounds in its 10-year legal battle, but lost most
recently in the California Supreme Court. It stands one more chance of
having that decision reversed in the US Supreme Court.
Past US administrations have always supported Barclays' position, on the
grounds that the California law interferes with tax treaties signed by the
federal government with other countries. But President Bill Clinton is
understood to have decided to back California, motivated largely by worries
about the state's budget crisis. It faces a Dollars 8.6bn deficit next year.
In 1985 the UK passed a law authorising retaliation, but has never triggered
it. Sir Michael claims that the US has ceased to believe in that threat.

MR Arthur Levitt, a former chairman of the American Stock Exchange, is
expected to be named by President Bill Clinton this week as the new chairman
of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the government agency which
polices the securities industry.
Mr Levitt, who is 62 and owns Roll Call, a newspaper covering Congress, will
succeed Mr Richard Breeden, a Republican appointee, who is stepping down
several months before the end of his term.
One of the most important actions facing Mr Levitt is the release by the SEC
of a long-awaited report, called Market 2000, which will present a detailed
study of the future of the US capital markets.
Mr Levitt has been favourite to get the SEC post for some months, after
edging ahead of Ms Consuela Washington, a congressional aide.

FT  29 APR 93 / US red tape ties up food for Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Dollars 900m (Pounds 584.4m) food aid package promised by President Bill
Clinton to his Russian counterpart, Mr Boris Yeltsin, at the Vancouver
summit earlier this month has stalled in Washington. Some grain interests
are now saying that bureaucratic difficulties may prevent the aid ever
reaching Russia.
The package, which did not require special funding, was designed to ship
food quickly, in time to support Mr Yeltsin's wavering power base. Russia
has been shut out of the US commercial grain trade since late November, when
it stopped paying interest on billions of dollars in US-guaranteed loans.
However, the US Agriculture Department, which oversees the aid programme, is
embroiled in a controversy over how it will pay to ship the food. Russia has
also balked at accepting the Dollars 700m in concessionary loans that
comprise the bulk of the package because it is being required to pay above
world market rates for both the grain and the freight.
To date, neither the loans nor about Dollars 444m in US food donations
promised to Russia since October have left the US. 'Clinton does not appear
to have been aware of US farm laws' when he made the promises to Mr Yeltsin,
said Mr Steve McCoy, president of the Washington-based North American Grain
Export Association.
A Russian delegation is visiting Washington today and tomorrow to discuss
the problems. The delegation includes executives from Russia's domestic and
export grain-buying agencies, as well as Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy
premier for foreign economic affairs.
Agriculture Department officials, fearing the aid programme will fail, seem
prepared to announce a solution to the freight problem during the Russian
visit.
'The money for the freight will be found one way or the other,' said one.
The agency is expected to shift funds - as much as Dollars 319m, according
to one congressional report - from other programmes to pay the bill.
Smoothing out Russian objections to the concessionary loans will be more
difficult. Mr McCoy believed Russia might prefer to side-step the Dollars
700m offer and wait for more palatable guaranteed commercial loans to become
available.
The food give-away portion of the programme stalled when freight speculators
drove up already expensive rates for US flagged vessels. Cargo preference
laws require US ships to deliver 75 per cent of the food aid. Money shifted
from the Defence Department budget was to be used to pay for this, but now
rates have moved beyond that budget.
Faced with abandoning the donations or asking Congress to provide taxpayers'
money to pay the freight, the Department is re-tendering for the ships,
hoping for more reasonable prices.

FT  29 APR 93 / World Bank pledges drive to cut poverty
</HEADLINE>

   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Lewis Preston, World Bank president, yesterday promised to strengthen the
bank's efforts to reduce poverty in developing countries. 'Poverty reduction
must be the benchmark against which our performance as a development
institution is judged,' he said.
However, he failed to respond to demands from the Clinton administration for
the bank to set more precise targets for the proportion of lending that
should have an explicit poverty focus.
In congressional testimony this week, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury
secretary, said the US wanted to see more funding that 'will create social
and economic safety nets' for poor people most affected by war, civil strife
and economic mismanagement. 'We will look for specific increases in the
share of lending going for these purposes.'
In fiscal 1992, nearly half of all World Bank adjustment loans failed to
include specific poverty reduction measures, in spite of calls from Mr
Preston to put greater emphasis on poverty relief.
The share of bank lending allocated for 'human resource development' is
still only 14 per cent, in spite of repeated calls from Mr Preston for an
increased emphasis on investment in people.
At a news conference Mr Preston said the bank was making progress: a decade
ago only 5 per cent of bank lending went for human resource development and
only 5 per cent of structural adjustment loans had a explicit focus on
poverty.
But he said the bank had a 'long, long way to go'. While he expected an
increase in the share of bank lending aimed at poverty relief, he declined
to set precise targets for bank staff.
Mr Preston, however, does intend to take several new steps to sharpen the
bank's focus on poverty.
The bank will publish annual progress reports charting its progress in
poverty reduction. It will also seek the participation of the poor in the
design as well as the implemention of projects. 'We want this to become the
norm for our operations in the years to come,' Mr Preston said.
He also released a report, 'Implementing the World Bank's Strategy to Reduce
Poverty - Progress and Challenges', that outlines progress to date.

FT  29 APR 93 / Clinton cuts rail plans down to size
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration yesterday unveiled details of its plans to
promote high-speed rail links.
They focus on upgrading existing tracks to handle faster conventional
trains, using federal money to stimulate spending on tracks by state and
local governments. More advanced technologies such as magnetic levitation,
which can propel trains at up to 300mph, have been kept out of this first
phase.
During his election campaign Mr Clinton promised the 'creation of a
high-speed rail network linking our major cities and commercial hubs'.
Budget realities, however, have forced some scaling back of these ambitions.
Trains run at moderately high speeds in a northeastern corridor from Boston
to Washington, by way of New York, where trials have now begun of a Swedish
tilting train. However, long-distance passenger rail traffic has virtually
died in most other parts of the US.

FT  29 APR 93 / Fujimori deploys psychology against rebels: Peru's
pacification policy is bearing fruit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN overnight bus ride through the wild Andean mountains west of Ayacucho,
traditional bastion of Peru's Maoist Sendero Luminoso guerrillas, is a
memorable but probably inadvisable experience. Apart from the state of the
roads, it is unnerving to be stopped and ordered to descend by a 12-year-old
vigilante brandishing a loaded Winchester.
Nine months ago no foreigner would have contemplated such a trip. The fact
that it is now possible indicates that President Alberto Fujimori's
pacification policy is bearing the fruit he has doggedly promised since his
early months in office.
In his speech to the nation on the anniversary of last April's institutional
coup - when he dissolved congress and suspended the constitution - Mr
Fujimori used recent successes in the battle against terrorism as the prime
justification for the controversial move, which provoked international
community criticism and the freezing of aid.
'The major achievement of the period has been the life sentences passed on
Abimael Guzman and Victor Polay (leaders of guerrilla groups Sendero
Luminoso and MRTA),' he said. 'Now the fiercest terrorism in the west is
being defeated, without bathing the country in blood and without
indiscriminate repression.'
The Ayacucho area, where 13 years ago Sendero declared war on the Peruvian
state, is under the command of Gen Ronaldo Rueda. He also served there in
1987.
'There's been a tremendous change,' he says. 'Although there are a few
(guerrilla) columns still bothering us, we now have Sendero on the run.'
He claims that tough army action in past years combined with today's less
repressive approach has convinced the bulk of Sendero collaborators to
switch camp and support the state instead. 'In this new scheme, the rondas
have played a decisive role,' he says.
Rondas, or peasant self-defence groups, sprang up spontaneously in the area
when remote communities decided that they must defend themselves rather than
rely on the army. Initially, their arms were pitchforks and machetes.
For the past two years, however, in areas like Ayacucho, they have been
given hunting rifles and basic military training. Armed peasants now play a
big part in controlling roads and gathering information on guerrilla
movements. They frequently take part in joint patrols alongside the regular
army.
Forty miles from Ayacucho lies Huanta, another area dominated by Sendero
until a year or so ago. Here too army and ronderos parade noisily together
on Sunday mornings to show locals who now has the upper hand. Paradoxically,
the black-shirted goose-stepping ronderos look more martial than their
military collegues, relaxed in sky-blue T-shirts.
As part of its psychological battle for the hearts and minds of the local
peasantry, the Huanta detachment recently formed a military band. It has
been swamped by invitations to perform at remote rural celebrations -
Commandante Max Salazar calls it 'my most effective counter-subversive
weapon'.
The Ayacucho batallion now spends up to 80 per cent of its time 'winning
over the population', according to Gen Rueda. So-called 'civic action'
includes road repairs, handouts of staple foodstuffs, the provision of basic
medical and dental care and the free services of an army barber.
Much the same tactics are employed in the capital's shanty-towns. Police and
army sweeps have become a regular feature of life for the poor of Lima's
'red zones'. But house-to-house searches and wholesale detentions of those
without identity documents are accepted with little or no protest.
Gen Nicolas de Bari Hermoza, head of the joint chiefs of staff, claims that,
since receiving enhanced powers, the security forces have captured 2,500
so-called terrorists. Well over a hundred have been sentenced to life prison
terms.
Under emergency decrees, the Fujimori government last year re-defined the
crime of terrorism as 'treason to the fatherland'. Those accused are tried
by special military tribunals before unidentified, hooded judges. The idea
is both to speed up Peru's ponderously slow legal system and free judges
from the threat of reprisals.
Both objectives appear to have been successful, although at the expense of
transparency and, probably, impartiality in the administration of justice.
While life imprisonment is currently the maximum sentence for convicted
terrorists, Mr Fujimori and prominent members of his ruling majority party
would like to see the death penalty reinstated. Several Peruvian jurists
have already suggested ways in which capital punishment could be applied
retroactively to certain terrorist leaders already behind bars.
Whether Mr Guzman ends his days in his specially-constructed high-security
prison or some legal pretext is found to speed his demise, he appears
finally to have lost the almost magical hold he once enjoyed over his
followers. For a former colleague at Ayacucho's San Cristobal university,
the final blow to Mr Guzman's credibility came when he was paraded in a cage
before the press.
'We couldn't believe it,' he said. 'His speech was a disaster, so
out-of-date and riddled with old-fashioned dogma. We just laughed at him -
it was then the myth collapsed.'
But, despite some encouraging signs that Peru is moving towards
pacification, the war is not yet over. Selective Sendero attacks continue in
all corners of Peru leaving over a thousand dead in the past six months.

FT  29 APR 93 / Clinton may link aid to stimulus bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration may try to tie its plans for Russian aid into a
package with some of its domestic stimulus proposals in an attempt to win
backing in Congress for both. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary,
acknowledged yesterday that the Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.03bn) the US offered
President Boris Yeltsin at the Vancouver summit was already funded. But it
would be hard to win congressional approval for the further Dollars 1.8bn in
bilateral aid it promised at the Group of Seven meeting in Tokyo this month.
'That is a concern for us. It seems to me it has to be part of another try
at the stimulus package,' he said yesterday.
President Bill Clinton had to abandon his stimulus package, which contained
Dollars 16bn of spending on urban, infrastructure and educational projects
intended to give a short-term boost to the economy, in the face of a
Republican filibuster in the Senate.
Unlike the stimulus bill, the Russian aid proposals have the support of many
in the Republican leadership, so there is no threat of another filibuster.
But some of Mr Clinton's fellow Democrats in Congress, especially in the
House of Representatives, are now saying that if there is to be no help for
US inner cities, then they will not vote help for Russia.
Even Democrats convinced of the strategic importance of aiding Russia are
reluctant to do so, especially as they doubt whether the Republican
rank-and-file will share their leaders' desire to be statesmanlike on the
issue.
Mr Bentsen said no decision had yet been made on what precise mixture of
Russian aid and stimulus proposals should be included in a revised bill. He
said, however, that there would be an effort to bring the Republican
opposition on board at an early stage, and indicated that he himself would
play a leading role in building support for the measures in Congress.
'I think there will be attempts and approaches to make this bipartisan, and
I hope we are successful in that regard,' he said.
Leading congressional Democrats, however, have said this week that they want
to include Russian aid in a general foreign aid bill, rather than moving it
as separate legislation.

FT  29 APR 93 / Reno hits back over Waco challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANY lingering suspicion that Ms Janet Reno, the new attorney general, might
be a shrinking violet were thoroughly dispelled yesterday morning in her
spectacularly pugnacious defence of the government's actions ending the
siege of a religious faction's compound in Waco last week.
Cabinet members normally approach important congressional hearings with a
degree of deference. But that element was totally absent in several
exchanges between Ms Reno and members of the House judiciary committee,
above all with Mr John Conyers, veteran Michigan Democrat.
In a typically grandstanding address, he said he thought she should have
tendered her resignation because of the Waco debacle, in which over 80 cult
members died. He was also not satisfied with her explanations of the deaths
of the children in the compound. 'This is a profound disgrace to law
enforcement in the United States.'
Ms Reno glared at him from behind her glasses and stuck out her jaw. 'I feel
more strongly about it (the deaths of the children) than you will ever
know,' she spat out with visible anger. 'I will not walk away from a
compound where (federal) agents were killed. I will not engage in
recriminations. I will look to the future.'
Mr Conyers looked stunned. Ms Reno demanded that he ask more specific
questions of her. The congressman blustered. She offered to come to his
office for a private talk, a gesture quickly seized on by the committee
chairman as a way of dispelling the tension.
Nor, in other sharp exchanges, did she seek to shift any of the
reponsibility for the bloody Waco denouement on to President Bill Clinton,
the FBI, or any one other than David Koresh, the cult leader who died in the
conflagration.
'The decision how to proceed was mine,' she stated.' I advised the
president. . . of my decision to authorise the use of tear gas and he said
he would support my decision.' There was 'no realistic expectation the
matter would be resolved peacefully if we did nothing'.

FT  29 APR 93 / Reforms planned to improve success rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank will introduce reforms to try to reverse a steady
deterioration in the success rate of its projects, Mr Lewis Preston, the
bank's president, said yesterday.
Mr Preston was referring to the findings of an internal review of project
performance by a task-force headed by Mr Willi Wapenhans, a senior bank
official.
The Wapenhans report, which the bank has not yet published, found 'a gradual
but steady deterioration in portfolio performance'. The number of projects
'judged unsatisfactory at completion' had risen from 15 per cent in fiscal
1981 to 30.5 per cent in fiscal 1989 and 37.5 per cent in fiscal 1991.
It said problems were concentrated in Africa and Latin America but other
regions 'also had 30-40 per cent of problem projects in their 4-5 year old
portfolios.'
Mr Preston said he was 'disturbed' by the report because it meant
implementation of bank projects 'was not what it should be'.
However, he said critics misunderstood the meaning of the failure rate. It
was high partly because the bank set an ambitious standard for success: a 10
per cent economic rate of return. Projects that failed to meet this criteria
need not be a 'failure in terms of development'.
Mr Preston said the most important step toward improved performance lay in
altering the bank's culture. In the past staff had been judged mainly on the
number of project loans they managed to initiate, not on their ability to
guide a project to a successful conclusion.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, underscored the point in
congressional testimony this week and said he would press for prompt
remedial action.
'The right measure of performance is the developmental impact of the bank's
operations and not simply the level of new lending that can be approved in
any given year.'

FT  29 APR 93 / UK heading for clash over California tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN and the US are heading towards a confrontation in the long-running
dispute over California's system for taxing foreign companies.
The British government still wants to resolve the issue in talks with the US
administration, but Mr John Major, the prime minister, is under mounting
pressure from backbench MPs and from business to take a much tougher line.
Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, was due to raise the issue in
Washington last night with Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary.
British critics complain that the government has lost credibility and must
order immediate retaliation against US companies if it is to be taken
seriously in negotiations.
Sir Michael Grylls, chairman of the Conservative backbench committee on
trade and industry, has warned that the Clinton administration's 'appalling'
decision not to file a brief in support of Barclays Bank, whose suit is the
test case on California's system of taxation, 'leaves the British government
with no credible option but immediately to retaliate'.
Mr Major is also understood to have been advised by his diplomats to set the
clock running on a threat of retaliation.
California's system of worldwide unitary taxation assesses taxes on
companies not on the profits they actually make in the state, but on a
proportion of their worldwide earnings.
Barclays has won several rounds in its 10-year legal battle, but lost most
recently in the California Supreme Court. It stands one more chance of
having that decision reversed in the US Supreme Court.
Past US administrations have always supported Barclays' position, on the
grounds that the California law interferes with tax treaties signed by the
federal government with other countries. But President Bill Clinton is
understood to have decided to back California, motivated largely by worries
about the state's budget crisis.
The state, which faces a Dollars 8.6bn budget deficit next year, claims it
stands to lose Dollars 800m if the decision goes against it, including taxes
it would have to repay Barclays and others.
In 1985 the UK passed a law authorising retaliation, but has never triggered
it. Sir Michael claims that the US has ceased to believe in that threat.

FT  29 APR 93 / World Bank pledges drive to cut poverty: Preston fails to
respond to demands from Clinton to set more precise targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Lewis Preston, World Bank president, yesterday promised to strengthen the
bank's efforts to reduce poverty in developing countries. 'Poverty reduction
must be the benchmark against which our performance as a development
institution is judged,' he said.
However, he failed to respond to demands from the Clinton administration for
the bank to set more precise targets for the proportion of lending that
should have an explicit poverty focus.
In congressional testimony this week, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury
secretary, said the US wanted to see more funding that 'will create social
and economic safety nets' for poor people most affected by war, civil strife
and economic mismanagement. 'We will look for specific increases in the
share of lending going for these purposes.'
In fiscal 1992, nearly half of all World Bank adjustment loans failed to
include specific poverty reduction measures, in spite of calls from Mr
Preston to put greater emphasis on poverty relief.
The share of bank lending allocated for 'human resource development' is
still only 14 per cent, in spite of repeated calls from Mr Preston for an
increased emphasis on investment in people.
At a news conference Mr Preston said the bank was making progress: a decade
ago only 5 per cent of bank lending went for human resource development and
only 5 per cent of structural adjustment loans had a explicit focus on
poverty.
But he said the bank had a 'long, long way to go'. While he expected an
increase in the share of bank lending aimed at poverty relief, he declined
to set precise targets for bank staff.
Mr Preston, however, does intend to take several new steps to sharpen the
bank's focus on poverty.
The bank will publish annual progress reports charting its progress in
poverty reduction. It will also seek the participation of the poor in the
design as well as the implemention of projects. 'We want this to become the
norm for our operations in the years to come,' Mr Preston said.
He also released a report, 'Implementing the World Bank's Strategy to Reduce
Poverty - Progress and Challenges,' that outlines progress to date.
This highlights the diversity of performance on poverty reduction in the
third world. East Asia has reduced the proportion of people in absolute
poverty from over 30 per cent in 1970 to 10 per cent. Sub-Saharan Africa,
however, had seen an increase in poverty which now affected half the people
in the region.
Mr Preston said bank efforts to reduce poverty could succeed only if
governments concerned co-operated. Officials cited Indonesia, China, Mexico,
and El Salvador as examples of countries that were co-operating well but
declined to name poor performers.
He said hoped for a clear signal from this week's meeting of the Group of
Seven leading industrial countries that they would deliver on commitments
for a Dollars 18bn replenishment of resources for the International
Development Agency (IDA), the centrepiece of bank efforts to reduce poverty.

FT  29 APR 93 / Keating takes first step to republic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR PAUL KEATING, the Australian prime minister, yesterday appointed a
committee of 10 eminent public figures to draw up options for Australia's
proposed transition from constitutional monarchy to republican government,
Kevin Brown writes from Sydney.
The appointments fulfil an undertaking given during the campaign for last
month's federal election, in which the pro-republican Labor party was
unexpectedly re-elected.
However, Mr Keating made clear that the committee's report would have to be
followed by a lengthy public debate, and probably a constitutional
conference, before the change.
Opinion polls suggest that between 50 and 70 per cent of voters favour a
change in the constitution, which prescribes that Australia's head of state
is the king or queen of Britain, the former colonial power.
However, constitutional amendments require approval at a referendum by a
majority of states as well as a majority of voters. In practice, this means
that amendments must have overwhelming support to succeed.
With this in mind, Mr Keating admitted for the first time that his campaign
to transform Australia into a republic would fail if sufficiently widespread
agreement could not be reached.
Australia's annualised rate of inflation increased from 0.3 per cent to 1.2
per cent in the three months to the end of March.

FT  29 APR 93 / Red carpet down under for Japan: Keating to press Asian
credentials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KIICHI Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, arrives in Canberra today
certain of a warm welcome from Australia's Labor government, which is
emerging as one of Tokyo's closest allies.
Fresh from a lecture on trade policy in Washington, Mr Miyazawa will find Mr
Paul Keating, his Australian counterpart, supportive of Japan's position and
anxious to demonstrate Australia's Asian credentials.
If there is a sour note, it will come from Australia's voluble armed
services veterans' association, which wants Japan to apologise for its
treatment of allied prisoners during the second world war.
Mr Miyazawa is unlikely to oblige. But he may collect a further endorsement
from Mr Keating for Japan's hesitant expansion of its international role to
a level more in keeping with its economic strength.
The ostensible purpose of the visit is to allow Mr Miyazawa to solicit
Australian opinions on 'regional concerns' to be raised at a summit of the
Group of Seven leading industrialised nations in Tokyo in July.
These are likely to include Cambodia, where United Nations-sponsored
elections are scheduled next month, and the regional implications of North
Korea's withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Mr Miyazawa also wants to talk about the increasing role of the UN in
solving international disputes, and the need for a security structure to
solve disputes in the Asia-Pacific region.
Officials on both sides say that bilateral trade frictions will play little
part in the talks, suggesting that Mr Keating will resist domestic pressure
to call for access to Japan's rice and legal services markets.
But Australia is likely to offer support for Mr Miyazawa's rejection of
President Bill Clinton's demands for managed trade to reduce Japan's
USDollars 70bn (Pounds 45.4bn) trade surplus with the US.
How far Mr Keating is prepared to go will depend on his assessment of the
likely impact on Australian relations with Washington, which are already
strained by disputes over US barriers to agricultural trade.
But the tone of the talks was set on Monday by Senator Peter Cook, the trade
minister, who told a Kuala Lumpur audience that Australia would be
'concerned' about the use of sectoral trade targets to redress the US
deficit.
'We continue to believe that the best way of resolving this bilateral trade
issue is through an early and substantial outcome to the Uruguay Round of
talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,' he said.
Canberra's support for Japan is based partly on self-interest and partly on
the government's desire to overcome Asian suspicions of Aust-ralia's
willingness to commit itself unreservedly to the region.
Australia recorded a USDollars 5bn trade surplus on its USDollars 12.3bn
exports to Japan in the 12 months to the end of March, compared with sales
to the US of about USDollars 4bn.
Exports to other Asian countries are worth about the same as those to Japan,
and Canberra is concerned that intra-Asian trade could be disrupted if Japan
and other countries were forced to buy more US exports.
This analysis lay behind Mr Keating's warning to Mr Clinton earlier this
year that the US would accumulate 'resentment and resistance' if it
attempted to use bilateral trade agreements to discriminate against Japan.
In return for support against the US, Mr Keating will seek Japanese
endorsement for his attempts to beef up the Asia Pacific Economic
Co-operation (Apec) process, a grouping of 15 countries initiated by
Australia in 1989.
In a recent report commissioned by the government, Mr Richard Snape,
professor of economics at Monash University, said there was little prospect
of transforming Apec into a trade bloc, as Mr Keating has sometimes
suggested.
Nevertheless, Canberra sees Apec as a potentially valuable bulwark for
liberal trading, and is anxious to recruit Japanese support before a
ministerial meeting in the US later this year.
At a more philosophical level, relations with Japan are central to
Australia's emerging view of itself as an integral part of Asia, rather than
an outpost of Europe.
Australian recognition of the importance of its Asian backyard has been
growing since the mid-1950s, when a conservative government signed the first
trade agreements with Japan.
But it has gathered pace since the 1970s, when the scrapping of whites-only
immigration controls coincided with entry into the European Community of the
UK, the former colonial power.
More recently, Mr Keating's proposal to abolish the monarchy, the last
constitutional link with Britain, has been presented by the government as a
further demonstration of Australia's break with its European past.
How seriously Tokyo takes Canberra's Asian aspirations is not clear. But Mr
Kazuo Ogura, director general of the Foreign Ministry's economic affairs
bureau, threw a straw into the wind recently when he noted that a 'partner
is needed for regional union,' and that that partner could well be
Australia.
'Japan and Australia possess common values of democracy and freedom, they
both support, in general, market principles and free trade,' said Mr Ogura.
'They have a very deep relationship of economic interdependence, and they
possess common interests in security and political aspects. Could not Japan
and Australia go further than that?' Mr Ogura asked.
Mr Miyazawa will fly from Canberra to Auckland for a short meeting with Mr
Jim Bolger, the prime minister of New Zealand, which also runs a healthy
trade surplus with Japan.
Mr Bolger is unlikely to be quite as polite as Mr Keating.
He faces a difficult election this year, and is under pressure to force a
quick conclusion to negotiations for access to the Japanese apple market,
which has been delayed by an emotional campaign by Japanese growers.

Western aid donors yesterday pledged Dollars 2.15bn (Pounds 1.57bn) aid to
Bangladesh, urging it to liberalise its economy further and do more to help
the poor, Reuter reports from Paris.
In a statement issued after a two-day meeting in Paris, donors praised
Bangladesh's economic management but some had reservations about its human
rights record, criticised in an Amnesty International report out yesterday.
Mr Saifur Rahman, finance minister, said the aid - about Dollars 100m more
than he requested - showed the donors' confidence in Bangladesh and said
only one or two of the 14 countries at the meeting raised the human rights
issue.

A curfew was imposed in Srinagar and adjoining towns in Kashmir yesterday,
after the Indian army and central government paramilitary forces made over
2,000 striking policemen of the Jammu and Kashmir state constabulary
surrender their weapons after a bloodless all-night operation, writes Shiraz
Sidhva in New Delhi.
The army operation and the week-long police strike that preceded it have
seriously undermined the government's recent efforts to initiate a political
process in the valley, where a separatist insurgency has raged since
December 1989. 'There will now be a further hardening of stance,' said a
senior home ministry official.
Thousands of policemen in Jammu and Kashmir went on a rampage in the streets
of Srinagar after Mr Riyaz Ahmed, a constable of the Jammu and Kashmir armed
police, was arrested by the army and later killed in army custody.

Israel agreed yesterday to permit the return of 30 Palestinians expelled
before 1987 in a gesture aimed at improving the political atmosphere at the
Middle East peace talks which resumed in Washington this week, writes Roger
Matthews in Washington.
The 30, many of whom are members of Fatah, the mainstream Palestinian
organisation headed by Mr Yassir Arafat, are expected to return to the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip within the next few days. At least three
of them are former members of the executive committee of the Palestine
Liberation Organisation.
Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation, said she
hoped this was just the first instalment in allowing back many more people
and unravelling the whole policy of deportation.
Arab diplomats in Washington said the Israeli move would help bolster the
standing of the Palestinian negotiators in the occupied territories. The
Palestinian negotiating team returned to Washington this week on the
instructions of Mr Arafat following a bitter internal dispute. Resumption of
talks was delayed by nearly five months after Israel expelled 415
Palestinians, members of the radical Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups, who are
opposed to talks.
The impact of the Israeli gesture was offset yesterday by the worst day of
violence this month in the occupied territories. Israeli troops shot dead
three Palestinians, including a 12 year-old boy, and another 50 were
reported wounded.
A government reorganisation programme for Israel's banking system was
yesterday sharply criticised by the banks and their staff, writes Judy Maltz
in Jerusalem.
The programme, formulated jointly by the finance ministry and central bank,
calls for limiting bank holdings in non-banking enterprises and forcing the
large banks to sell off their banking subsidiaries.
Bank Leumi said the plan would cause serious damage to the Israeli banking
system. 'We hope the cabinet will weigh this damage against the benefits
before taking its decision,' it said.
The heads of the works committees of Israel's largest banks yesterday joined
their management in protesting over the programme and threatened to declare
a labour dispute if it was implemented. Bank managers said that while the
trend in the rest of the world is toward mergers and acquisitions, the
government will force them to sell off assets, making them less competitive.

BRITISH and Chinese negotiators said yesterday that talks in Beijing on Hong
Kong were proceeding normally, but they gave no indication whether progress
had been achieved.
The second round of talks is expected to conclude today, after which Mr
Jiang Enzhu, China's chief negotiator, will undertake a diplomatic mission
to Europe.
Sir Robin McLaren told reporters he had 'no quarrel' with Mr Jiang's use of
the the word 'normal' to describe initial talks. 'I think it is good that
these discussions can continue in the normal way,' Sir Robin said.
China's official press, however, indicated that little progress had been
achieved thus far. The English-language China Daily said there had been 'no
hint of progress from either side'.
The two sides have agreed to impose a news blackout on details of the talks
to avoid what has been described as 'microphone diplomacy'. That agreement
appears to have been honoured.
China, however, is continuing to assail Britain for reneging on prior
agreements on Hong Kong's transition to Chinese rule in 1997. Beijing has
reacted furiously to proposals advanced by Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's
governor, for a broadening of popular participation in the political process
in the lead-up to 1997.
China's official press has been urging Britain to 'return to the correct
path'. In early sparring, the two sides are thought to have spent much time
re-stating their own positions without engaging in negotiations as such.
No date has been set for a resumption of the talks, but Sir Robin indicated
that they would restart soon after Mr Jiang returned from Europe early next
month.

<TEXT>
THE OPPOSITION in Malaysia has called for a full inquiry into the activities
of Bank Negara, the country's central bank, following a dramatic fall in the
bank's special reserves.
Bank Negara's 1992 accounts, published earlier this month, reported a
MDollars 10bn (Pounds 2.53bn) charge last year against special contingency
funds arising from a loss in its gold and foreign exchange holdings.
Analysts in Kuala Lumpur allege that the central bank, known in London,
Tokyo and New York as an aggressive, and at times flamboyant, foreign
exchange dealer, lost millions of dollars last year in foreign exchange
trans-actions.
Mr Lim Kit Siang, leader of the opposition Democratic Action party, told
parliament the fall in the special reserves account was equivalent to an
entire year's government development expenditures.
Mr Jaffar Hussein, Bank Negara's governor, said this month the fall in the
special reserves had been misrepresented.

Western aid donors yesterday pledged Dollars 2.15bn (Pounds 1.57bn) aid to
Bangladesh, urging it to liberalise its economy further and do more to help
the poor, Reuter reports from Paris.
In a statement issued after a two-day meeting in Paris, donors praised
Bangladesh's economic management but some had reservations about its human
rights record, criticised in an Amnesty International report released
yesterday.
Mr Saifur Rahman, finance minister, told a news conference the aid - about
Dollars 100m more than he requested - showed the donors' confidence in
Bangladesh and said only one or two of the 14 countries at the meeting
raised the human rights issue.
A statement released by the World Bank, which chairs the aid meetings, said:
'Donors emphasised the crucial importance of reducing Bangladesh's
widespread and acute poverty through programmes to generate productive
employment for the poor.'
The report by Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group,
accused Bangladesh security forces of torture, rape and unlawful executions.

Mr Farooq Leghari, Pakistan's new finance minister, yesterday warned against
the consequences of a big budget deficit and appealed to business leaders
for help in solving economic problems, writes Farhan Bokhari in Karachi.
During his first meeting with representatives of the Federation of Pakistani
Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the country's largest business grouping
Mr Leghari said that if the problems created by the deficit are not solved,
'our economy can go into a tailspin, if that happens, we can look for a

The warning came amid growing concerns over the current year's budgetary
deficit, which is expected to exceed PRs100bn (Pounds 2.36bn) against an
earlier target of PRs65bn.

FT  29 APR 93 / New Aomori facility revives nuclear debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONSTRUCTION of a controversial Japanese nuclear reprocessing facility began
yesterday, prompting fresh debate over the government's ambitious plans to
use large amounts of plutonium for a new generation of nuclear plants.
After a traditional Shinto ceremony, ground was broken for the Y840bn
(Pounds 4bn) facility at Rokkasho, in the northern prefecture of Aomori,
adjacent to a nuclear waste storage site and a uranium enrichment plant
which are the centrepiece of Japan's nuclear programme.
The recent accident at the Tomsk-7 plutonium facility in Russia, and a
confession by the Russian navy that it routinely dumped nuclear waste in the
Sea of Japan, have heightened sensitivities.
After the Tomsk-7 incident, the Japanese Science and Technology Agency sent
officials to reassure the Aomori government, which is generally supportive
of the nuclear development plans. The agency argues that Japan is
resource-poor, and must build a reprocessing plant to safeguard long-term
energy supplies.
However, Japan has been quietly reviewing the plutonium policy since
international outcry late last year over its shipment of a tonne of
plutonium from France. About 30 tonnes are due to be shipped to Japan from
the UK and France over the next 15 years.
The imported plutonium, derived from the processing of Japanese waste, is
intended for use in a fast-breeder reactor that is still under development.
Anti-nuclear groups complain that the perfection of the reactor is not
assured.
On completion in 2000, the reprocessing facility will be able to handle
about 800 tonnes of spent fuel annually from 30 nuclear plants and produce
about 5 tons of plutonium for use in the fast-breeder plants.
Japan has 41 nuclear plants, and wants to build 40 more by 2010, but that
goal has been put out of reach by strong opposition from residents around
the proposed sites.
Mr Masaya Kitamura, Aomori's governor, said yesterday the plant would not
harm residents, and would add to the wealth of the prefecture. But the
Aomori Young Fisherman's Association said the government had ignored fears
that the facility could endanger the farming and fishing industries.

FT  29 APR 93 / Differences put China-Taiwan talks in jeopardy: Economic
issues left unresolved
</HEADLINE>

   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONCLUSION of talks last night between delegations from China and Taiwan
in Singapore was postponed until today following sharp differences between
the two on economic issues.
These are the highest-level talks between the two since the People's
Republic of China was founded in 1949. A joint document was due to have been
signed this morning.
A Taiwan delegate said that 'taking the totality of the meeting, it is more
in the black than in the red'. The China delegation was more upbeat, saying
considerable progress on many issues had been made.
The joint document is expected to include agreements on the joint
development of natural resources and provisions for scientific and cultural
exchanges.
Arguments centred on Taiwan's insistence that China offer some legal
framework for the protection of its investments on the Chinese mainland.
Conservative estimates put Taiwan investments in China at nearly Dollars 9bn
(Pounds 5.8bn). Last year alone more than Dollars 5bn of money from Taiwan
was invested in a wide variety of projects in China. At present all such
investments are indirect, made mostly through Hong Kong holding companies.
The mainland delegation at these talks has repeated Beijing's position that
existing investment protection rules in China are adequate. The Beijing side
said the formulation of any new laws was outside the scope of these talks.
Last night the Taiwan side said it was still hoping to include some concrete
joint proposals on the investment protection issue.
But the negotiators were reported ultimately to have agreed to discuss the
issue at a later date.
Beijing has also asked the Taiwanese for direct trade and air links, a
proposal Taipei refuses to countenance until China meets certain conditions,
including renouncing the use of force against Taiwan and recognising the
island as a separate entity and not, as at present, as another province of
China.
According to delegates from both sides, their long-term goal of
reunification would be assisted by closer economic ties and an easing of
cold war tensions.

SRI LANKAN police clashed with mourners yesterday at the funeral of Mr
Lalith Athulathmudali, former minister of national security and more
recently president of a new opposition party, who was gunned down last
Friday when addressing an election rally in a suburb of Colombo.
One death was said to have resulted as students threw stones at the police,
who responded with teargas.
A Scotland Yard team is in Colombo to help the investigation into the
killing of Mr Athulathmudali. The body of a young Tamil, his presumed
assassin, was found nearby. The Colombo judicial medical officer said he
died of cyanide poisoning, capsules of which are standard equipment of the
highly motivated hit-men of the separatist Tamil Tigers.
The medical officer also reported that the killer had a bullet lodged in his
spine and injuries on his hip. Mr Athulathmudali's bodyguards had fired back
when the assassin aimed his revolver at the speaker on the platform.
A spokesman for the Tamil Tigers in London has denied that the Tigers were
involved.
The Tigers did have reason to hate Mr Athulathmudali. As national security
minister, he commanded 'Operation Liberation', the last attempt by the Sri
Lankan army to quell the 10-year-old secessionist revolt in the Tamil north
and ethnically-mixed eastern province.
Mr Athulathmudali, who as security minister, incurred the wrath of the
Tigers when he insisted that 14 Tiger terrorists in army custody in the
north should be brought to Colombo for trial. Despite Indian protests,
President Jayawardene backed Mr Athulathmudali. The 14 Tigers swallowed
their cyanide capsules.
After a dispute with Mr Premadasa, Mr Athulathmudali joined an opposition
motion to impeach the president. Lucky to survive, Mr Premadasa sacked the
plotters from the party. The new party, the Democratic United National
Front, was the outcome.

FT  29 APR 93 / South Africa in bank debt talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SOUTH AFRICAN government has held discussions in London with creditor
banks in an attempt to negotiate a final arrangement of the debt standstill
that has been in place since 1985.
The third interim arrangement between the government and creditor banks,
regulating repayment of loans frozen since 1985 when the government declared
a moratorium on capital repayments of over half of its outstanding debt,
expires at the end of 1993. The talks are aimed at deciding terms for the
repayment of the remaining Dollars 5.5bn (Pounds 3.6bn), still subject to
the standstill agreement, which comes due then.
A final arrangement will have a beneficial impact on bankers' and investors'
perceptions of South Africa's creditworthiness. However, any pressure it may
put on the country's balance of payments could undermine an economic
recovery vital to underpinning the transition to democracy.
Those close to the talks, which took place over the past two days at
Standard Chartered Bank, say South African has proposed a final arrangement,
which would run to the year 2000. At the end of this seven-year period South
Africa would have fully repaid all amounts owing since 1985.
The offer is reported to be that principal repayments will continue to be
made for the first four years at about Dollars 385m a year - about the same
rate as under the existing arrangement.
The remaining Dollars 3.9bn will be repaid over the last three years in
equal semi-annual instalments.
Early indications are that the government's terms have been fairly well
received among European banks but it is understood that certain US banks are
reluctant to accept a final arrangement unless it has the approval of the
African National Congress.
Mr Jonathan Leape of the London School of Economics said a seven-year
repayment schedule implied a doubling of the average annual repayment under
the third interim arrangement. This places a potentially heavy burden of
capital outflows on the economy during the transition period.
South Africa's total foreign debt is about Dollars 18bn, in current exchange
rate terms, compared to Dollars 23.7bn when the standstill was declared.

FT  29 APR 93 / Japanese industrial production rises by 0.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MODEST rise in Japanese industrial production, a sharp fall in inventories
and a marked upturn in housing starts last month, announced by the
government yesterday, confirm that the decline in the economy may have
bottomed out in the first three months of the year.
Industrial production rose 0.5 per cent in March, the second consecutive
monthly increase. Production was 2.3 per cent down on March last year, the
smallest annual decline in industrial production for 15 months.
Most significantly there are signs that manufacturing companies are finally
starting to make some headway in reducing their inventories of unsold
products.
With shipments of products rising by 1.6 per cent in March, the index which
measures the ratio of inventories to shipments fell 3.4 per cent to 106.7,
the lowest level since last September. The inventory to shipment ratio has
fallen for each of the last four months.
The upturn in production was mainly due to increased demand for cars and
consumer electronics such as camcorders. Chemical, steel and paper output
fell.
However, the modest rise in March production was well below expectations,
according to Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities. Ministry of
International Trade and Industry officials warned it was too early to claim
production was set to expand again as consumer spending remains depressed.
Miti expects further declines in the next two months.
The housing market continued to rally in March with the first annual
increase for two years in construction starts for condominiums. Starts on
condominiums for sale rose by 8.6 per cent last month, compared with the
year before, while starts on houses for rent were 13.3 per cent higher.
Publicly funded rental housing starts rose 52 per cent, reflecting the surge
in public spending on construction in the government's pump priming
programme.
Total housing starts were 9.2 per cent up from last year.
Industrial investment will continue to be severely cut in the coming year,
according to a survey published by the Economic Planning Agency.
Corporate investment will fall by 11.9 per cent from the likely outturn for
this year, the steepest drop on record, the EPA said.
The forecast was based on the EPA's quarterly survey of 4,565 large
companies.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is unlikely to reveal new policies regarding the
Bosnian crisis before next week, according to the White House.
Ms Dee Dee Myers, the presidential press secretary, would neither confirm
nor deny speculation that Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state,
would visit Europe for consultations before the US and its allies announced
their next moves.
But she drew attention to Mr Christopher's testimony to Congress on Tuesday
in which he had spoken of the importance of ensuring American public support
for any decision. This implies that Mr Clinton himself, plus other members
of the administration, may try to lay out policy options in speeches and
elsewhere in the days ahead.
The president himself said after meeting congressional leaders late on
Tuesday that 'new questions, some new issues and some interesting arguments'
had been discussed.
But he dropped no hint as to whether he was leaning in favour of allied air
strikes, lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia, continuing the course of
sanctions and diplomatic pressure, or in what combination.
Gen Merrill McPeak, the US air force chief of staff, told a Senate
appropriations sub-committee that bombing Serbian artillery positions in the
former Yugoslavia would be completely effective and pose 'virtually no risk'
to attacking aircraft. He said the relatively scarce and unsophisticated
surface-to-air weapons available to the Serbs would make the aerial campaign
'virtually no risk to ourselves'.
Nato chiefs have not excluded the use of air strikes in Bosnia but have
warned about serious difficulties and risks involved in such a policy.
US military officials confirmed yesterday that General Colin Powell,
chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, had held informal talks with Nato
colleagues about options for intervening in the war, including the use of
bombers.

FRANCE may withdraw its 5,000 troops in former Yugoslav republics unless the
United Nations clarifies the role of the peacekeeping force, Mr Francois
Leotard, the French defence minister, said yesterday.
The defence minister, who recently caused controversy with his threat to
recall General Philippe Morillon, commander of the UN force in Bosnia, said
in the National Assembly that the UN needed to improve its organisation of
the peacekeeping operation and to define the force's role more clearly.
Mr Leotard said there was 'no question' of an immediate withdrawal of French
troops.
However, he said that unless there were improvements in the running of the
UN operation the French government would be forced to draw certain
conclusions about the obscurity of the UN's conduct.
The defence minister's comments reflect previous criticism of the UN's
handling of the peacekeeping operation from the French military. The UK
government has also criticised the UN's role.

FT  29 APR 93 / Serb parliament backs peace plan

<TEXT>
SERBIA'S parliament yesterday endorsed an international peace plan for
Bosnia in an effort to stave off military intervention.
The belated show of support for the previously vilified plan comes a day
after tough new sanctions were imposed on Serbia and Montenegro. The new
measures were imposed after the Bosnian Serb assembly on Monday rejected a
peace plan, despite its backing by Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of
Serbia, Mr Dobrica Cosic, the Yugoslav president, and Mr Momir Bulatovic,
president of Montenegro.
The parliament's vote to back Mr Milosevic's appeal could signal a split in
the alliance between his ruling Socialists and the ultra-nationalist Serbian
Radicals.
Diplomats yesterday remained unconvinced by the last-minute appeal for
peace. 'There have not yet been tangible signs that they are prepared to
take the steps necessary to bring the Bosnian Serbs aboard,' said one.
Meanwhile, new clashes between Croat and Moslem forces erupted in central
Bosnia. Bosnian radio said Croat forces were launching sporadic attacks near
Jablanica and Kiseljak, just west of Sarajevo.
Bosnian Radio said Serb forces had launched an assault near Brcko, in the
north-east, while Serbian radio claimed Moslems and Croats were attacking
the area.
Bosnian Serbs warned the UN High Commissioner for Refugees that aid convoys
would not be allowed into the eastern town of Gorazde for two weeks.
According to Bosnian radio there was also heavy fighting in Bihac, the
north-western Moslem heartland.
Reuter adds: A UN Security Council team recently returned from Bosnia
proposed designating Sarajevo a UN safe area, as well as the towns of Tuzla,
Gorazde and Zepa.
This would involve the withdrawal of weapons. The first safe area declared
by the Security Council, on April 16, was Srebrenica.

FT  29 APR 93 / Spanish Elections: Gonzalez takesa gamble with the peseta -
Spain's looming election is putting its currency under new pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT WOULD be cruel to suggest that the Bank of Spain has been so stoutly
defending the peseta over the past week because there is a general election
on June 6. But it is hard to find anyone in Madrid who believes the bank's
support of the peseta since late last week has been anything but political.
The Socialist government of Mr Felipe Gonzalez is going to lose its
parliamentary majority on June 6, but it boasts so often of its commitment
to a stable peseta that a devaluation before then would be a political
disaster.
The central bank has made great efforts to stave off a probable - most
Spanish businessmen would say desirable - third devaluation in six months
until after the poll. Traders believe that, unusually, the bank has been
selling D-Marks forward for pesetas and that the official foreign exchange
reserves of about Dollars 45bn (Pounds 29.2bn) now vastly overstate the true
figure.
Minus the forward commitments, some estimates put the bank's foreign
exchange reserves below Dollars 20bn. Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance
minister, has said any defence of the currency which drove reserves below
Dollars 30bn would be too costly.
The bank will not comment, but it is clear that Mr Gonzalez' decision to
bring the election forward by five months has changed official arithmetic.
Victory is suddenly priceless. If the bank is intervening forward, it is at
least selling its D-Marks at a profit as the peseta slides but, if the
currency is devalued, the pesetas the bank is committed to buy at current
prices in the futures markets could be expensive.
But for the government, the decision to fight off speculative attacks is
risky. A devaluation would be a very public humiliation. Mr Gonzalez added
to the turmoil of last week by conceding that the Socialists would not win
outright. He foresaw a weak government and new elections in 1994.
Spain is already in recession and will not be firmly governed for, perhaps,
more than a year. What does that make the peseta worth? Pta74 to the D-Mark
where the Bank of Spain has decided to draw its line in the sand? Or
Pta78-Pta80, where it might have a positive effect on exports?
Senior officials are approaching the weekend with some trepidation as
Saturdays are when devaluations usually take place and the Thursday and
Friday can boil with expectation. It could all begin again today, though the
currency recovered yesterday after the Bundesbank cut its repo rate. By late
afternoon the peseta was trading at between Pta73 and Pta73.30 to the D-Mark
after having fallen below Pta74 for a while on Tuesday.
So far Spain's defence has led to short-term interest rates shooting up from
about 13 per cent to 18 per cent and were rising again late yesterday from
close to 15 per cent overnight to about 16 per cent. But there is only so
much the heavily indebted Spanish can do to interest rates without ruining
the government bond market, so they have also been urgently lobbying their
friends.
Mr Gonzalez flew to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Austrian retreat three weeks
ago, knowing that he was about to gamble on an early election and that the
peseta would suffer as a result. One effect became clear last week when the
Bundesbank led five other European central banks in a massive defence of the
peseta. Last Tuesday the Bundesbank again stood up for the Spanish, saying
it saw no reason for a devaluation.
Despite the relief yesterday, analysts believe the markets will return to
bet hard against that advice, particularly as opinion polls show Mr
Gonzalez' conservative opponents, the Partido Popular (PP), slightly ahead.
There is little doubt the PP would be happy with a devaluation. In fact, PP
supporters frequently suggest they would not be too upset if Spain left the
ERM altogether.
Mr Gonzalez, who normally has no equal as a political campaigner in Spain,
has to turn his full attention to the campaign. But even should he begin to
claw back the PP lead in the next few weeks, he is going to have to take on
the money markets as well.

FT  29 APR 93 / Clinton ponders options on Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is unlikely to reveal new policies towards the
Bosnian crisis before next week, according to the White House.
Ms Dee Dee Myers, the presidential press secretary, would neither confirm
nor deny speculation that Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state,
would visit Europe for consultations before the US and its allies announced
their next moves.
But she drew attention to Mr Christopher's testimony to Congress on Tuesday
in which he had spoken of the importance of ensuring American public support
for any decision. This implies that Mr Clinton himself, plus other members
of the administration, may try to lay out policy options in speeches and
elsewhere in the days ahead.
The president himself said after meeting congressional leaders late on
Tuesday that 'new questions, some new issues and some interesting arguments'
had been discussed, but he dropped no hint as to whether he was leaning in
favour of allied air strikes, lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia, continuing
the course of sanctions and diplomatic pressure, or in what combination.
Gen Merrill McPeak, the US Air Force Chief of Staff told a Senate
appropriations sub-committee that bombing Serbian artillery positions in the
former Yugoslavia would be completely effective and pose 'virtually no risk'
to attacking planes.
'Give us time and we will order (strikes) on every one of those artillery
positions and put it out of business,' he said.
He said that the relatively scarce and unsophisticated surface-to-air
weapons available to the Serbs would make the aerial campaign 'virtually no
risk to ourselves'.
Nato chiefs have not excluded the use of air strikes in Bosnia but have
warned about serious difficulties and risks involved in such a policy.
US military officials confirmed yesterday that General Colin Powell,
chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, had held informal talks with Nato
colleagues about options for intervening in the war, including the use of
bombers.
Field Marshal Sir Richard Vincent, the committee chairman, said there was no
indication that Nato military authorities would be asked to draw up plans
for air strikes.
He reacted angrily to suggestions that he had criticised western political
leaders on Tuesday. He reiterated the need for a clear statement of
political objectives before any change in strategy.

FT  29 APR 93 / Brussels to open telecom market by 1998
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday set a deadline of the beginning of 1998
for open competition in the Ecu100bn (Pounds 79bn) market for EC
telecommunications services, and promised to put pressure on member states
to liberalise domestic and international telephone calls.
The Commission hopes to get agreement from member states on the principle of
liberalisation, and the five-year timetable, before introducing draft
legislation. EC telecoms ministers, some of whom are bound to oppose rapid
liberalisation, will discuss the plan for the first time on May 10.
Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, said yesterday: 'The
transition period doesn't mean we are just going to sit back ineffectually
until 1998; it means the process will end at the latest in 1998. Progress
could be made more quickly than that.'
The plan should eventually allow non-EC operators to offer rival services on
EC networks. Mr Bangemann said yesterday access would only be granted if
non-EC markets were also opened.
The proposals go much further than the plan originally favoured by the
Commission, to open only intra-EC calls to competition. However, Brussels
has decided to continue discussions on the controversial question of setting
up competing private telecoms networks, instead of encouraging the immediate
use of existing cable TV and railway networks for telecoms services.
France, Belgium and Germany are opposed to rapid liberalisation, while
Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands favour a more aggressive effort to
increase competition. One aim is to reduce discrepancies between the cost of
local and international calls.
Mr Bangemann and Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, stressed
yesterday that liberalisation should not endanger a standard service for all
subscribers or the financial stability of operators.
British Telecom last night welcomed the Commission's call as 'excellent
news', saying liberalisation would be 'in the best interests of everyone,
particularly the consumer'.

FT  29 APR 93 / Battle to outdo Nissan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONDA, the Japanese carmaker, intends that by the end of the year its UK
assembly plant will rival Nissan's Sunderland operation, Europe's most
productive car assembly plant.
Mr Andrew Jones, manager of Honda's Pounds 300m plant in Swindon, Wiltshire,
said the company aimed to achieve an assembly time of 12.5 hours a car for
its large family car, the Honda Accord.
The Swindon plant started production in October and aims to reach its
capacity of 100,000 cars a year with two car ranges in 1995.
Productivity at Japanese carmakers' new plants in Europe, mainly in the UK,
is setting tough standards for European producers, whose productivity is
often half the best Japanese levels.
Mr Ian Gibson, managing director of Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK, said it
had cut 'hours per car' for its UK-built Primera - similar in size to the
Accord - to 12.5.
He said 'the best of the Europeans are running at around 20 hours per car'
for the same class of vehicle.
European competitors in this market segment include the Opel Vectra/Vauxhall
Cavalier, Ford Mondeo, Peugeot 405 and Volkswagen Passat.
The hours-per-car yardstick used by Nissan and Honda measures so-called
direct labour in the body welding, painting and final trim and assembly
parts of the manufacturing operation.
These processes are becoming established as a standard definition in
measuring car plant productivity.
Professor Daniel Jones, professor of motor industry management at Cardiff
Business School, said the productivity of European car assembly plants,
measured by direct hours and excluding support staff, averaged 20 to 22
hours per car.

FT  29 APR 93 / Honda plans 50% rise in sales to European markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONDA, the Japanese carmaker, is seeking to increase its sales in Europe by
more than 50 per cent in the next three years to around 270,000 in 1995 from
180,000 last year.
Mr Yuji Saito, Honda Europe car sales director, said the higher sales would
be driven by rising production from Honda's first European car plant, at
Swindon in the UK.
The expansion of production in Europe by Honda and other Japanese carmakers,
including Nissan and Toyota, is facing mounting resistance from established
carmakers in Europe in the face of steeply falling demand in the west
European new car market. The established carmakers are calling for a sharper
cut in direct vehicle imports from Japan.
Honda's Pounds 300m car plant, which has been added to the group's Pounds
70m car engine facility at the same site, began production last October and
is due to reach its planned capacity of 100,000 cars a year in 1995.
Mr Saito said that by the mid-1990s Honda planned to export around 150,000
cars a year to Europe from Japan. UK production would total around 100,000 a
year and 20,000 cars a year would be exported to Europe from Honda plants in
North America.
By 1995 the plant will be able to produce 200,000 engines a year. Some
75,687 engines were produced last year.
Some 32,400 Honda Concerto cars were produced in the UK last year under
contract at Rover's assembly plant at Longbridge, Birmingham, but production
will be switched to Honda's Swindon plant from late 1994, with the launch of
a new generation Concerto.
Honda sales were planned to reach 250,000 a year in west Europe and 20,000 a
year in east Europe by 1995, said Mr Saito.
Honda is in fourth place among the Japanese carmakers in Europe, with a 1.3
per cent share of the west European car market in 1992.
The Honda distribution network in Europe is being expanded to cope with the
planned sales growth, with the number of dealers rising to 2,000 by 1995
from 1,750 at present, said Mr Saito.
In addition Honda is seeking to establish a 200-strong dealer network in
east Europe by the mid-1990s. Honda is investing Pounds 300m in its UK car
plant and Pounds 70m in its associated engine plant and vehicle inspection
facilities.
Local content of the UK-produced Honda Accord at Swindon, now more than 60
per cent, is to rise to 80 per cent next year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER senior official of the Bush administration is being hired as legal
counsel in the US by Mr Giulio Andreotti, the former Christian Democrat
prime minister of Italy who is being investigated for alleged collusion with
the Sicilian Mafia.
Mr Abraham Sofaer, who was the state department's legal adviser between 1985
and 1990, said yesterday he had spoken to Mr Andreotti this week and was in
the process of being retained.
The hiring of Mr Sofaer, a high-profile lawyer whose last job was as legal
adviser to Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, confirms Mr
Andreotti's pledge to contest the Mafia-related charges vigorously.
Mr Sofaer, who helped to form the US government's legal position for its
1986 bombing raid against Libya under the Reagan administration, said he had
gained familiarity with Mafia issues as a federal court judge in New York
City between 1979 and 1985.
The hiring follows a vote on Tuesday by an Italian Senate commission to
waive the 74-year-old Mr Andreotti's parliamentary immunity. The waiver must
be confirmed by a secret ballot vote by the full Senate.
Mr Sofaer, a managing partner in Washington at the law firm of Hughes,
Hubbard and Reed, said that among his first efforts would be to try 'to
explain to the western press the way the precise issues before the Italian
Senate are not being properly depicted'.

FT  29 APR 93 / Germany defiant on Ekostahl subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treuhand agency responsible for privatising eastern German industry,
said yesterday it would continue to press the European Community to agree
subsidies for Ekostahl, the steel plant near the Polish border.
The European Commission said yesterday it could not support the Ekostahl
plan, which it said involved up to DM1.94bn (Pounds 780m) of state
subsidies, because it would add to severe over-capacity in the EC. Brussels
has told the Treuhand to find another way to save 2,000 jobs at the east
German plant.
But Mr Wolf Schode, the Treuhand's spokesman, said yesterday: 'We are
convinced, that if not now, then certainly in the future, we will obtain
subsidies so as to make Ekostahl competitive in the steel market.' Brussels
is already putting in place other parts of its plan to protect the EC
industry from the effects of over-capacity, recession and cheap non-EC
imports, but state subsidies could still be a stumbling block.
Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, and Mr Martin Bangemann,
responsible for industry, have called for a special meeting of EC industry
ministers in July to assess the Ekostahl state aid case, and parallel
proposals to subsidise the Spanish and Italian industries.
The credibility of the overall plan will be put in question if ministers do
not back a strict line on state subsidies unanimously. 'Only then will other
enterprises commit themselves to reduce capacity,' said Mr Van Miert
yesterday.
Brussels has already indicated its severe doubts about the Spanish
proposals, and will consider over the weekend new Italian plans for state
aid to Ilva, the country's loss-making steel producer.
Industry ministers will discuss the progress of the EC plan next Tuesday,
including an Ecu240m (Pounds 190m) budget for social aid, proposed by the
Commission yesterday. The cash, which will only be disbursed if matched by
member states, will help cover the cost of 50,000 to 60,000 steel industry
redundancies expected by 1995.
The Treuhand, which owns Ekostahl, requires two subsidy tranches aimed at
transforming the steel plant into a mini-mill, which would then be sold to
the private sector. The first tranche, totalling DM310m, would be earmarked
for modernising the cold rolling mill. The second phase envisages building a
mini-mill costing DM750m, for the production of hot-rolled flat products.
Western Germany's steel federation has opposed any subsidies on the grounds
that it would reopen the debate about subsidies in Spain and Italy. However,
both the Treuhand and the Ekostahl management believe that the steel
federation fears competition from a mini-mill which would produce high
quality steel.
'This is not a question of Ekostahl adding to the already high levels of
over-capacity,' a Treuhand official said. 'Ekostahl would not be producing
much more than its current 900,000 tons a year. As a mini-mill, it would no
longer be dependent on raw material imports from western Germany.
'It could stand on its own and be competitive. That is the issue,' the
spokesman added.

A number of the charges against Mr Andreotti are based on testimony provided
by former Mafia members who are now co-operating with the Italian
authorities.

THE European Commission approved the first draft of the 1994 European
Community budget yesterday, pencilling in a 7 per cent rise in spending to
Ecu70.1bn (Pounds 55.4bn) Reuter reports from Brussels.
The draft, which is the first stage of the budgetary negotiations between
the Commission, EC finance ministers and the European Parliament, compares
with this year's budgetted spending of Ecu65.5bn.
Spending on the common agricultural policy is pencilled in to rise 7.1 per
cent to Ecu36.5bn, but the budget commissioner, Mr Peter Schmidhuber, said
that because of recent changes in exchange rate parities affecting the Ecu
this was already likely to be Ecu1.5bn short of what was needed.
Spending on structural operations is put at Ecu23.2bn up 4.5 per cent, while
that on internal policies is put at Ecu4.24bn up 3.3 per cent.

FT  29 APR 93 / Sigh of relief on pensions: EC employers have escaped a
40-year bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS across Europe are entitled to breathe a collective sigh of relief.
They are unlikely to be asked to pick up the bill for more than 40 years of
paying men lower pensions than they offered women workers.
Moreover, they are not violating women's contractual employment rights if
they raise their retirement age to 65 to match that of male employees.
Yesterday, the European Court of Justice's chief adviser, the advocate
general, unequivocally said that employers need only equalise pensions from
May 1990, the date when the court first ruled that men and women must have
equal retirement ages.
It is estimated that full retrospection would have cost British employers
Pounds 50bn, Dutch employers Pounds 30bn, Belgian employers Pounds 15bn and
Irish employers Pounds 500m.
While the ECJ may decide to go against the advice of its advocate general,
it typically does not.
A final decision from the court is expected in June.
The cases at hand stem from an earlier one, Barber v Guardian Royal
Exchange, which was a watershed in occupational pensions.
It has forced employers in most European Community countries to revamp their
pension scheme rules.
In Britain, according to the National Association of Pension Funds, 89 per
cent of employers have equalised retirement ages, 59 per cent by raising the
age at which women can retire to 65. In the Netherlands, where private
employers offered lower retirement ages, scheme rules are also being
adjusted.
However, among the key questions about equalisation not answered by the
Barber judgment are:
If unequal pensions were illegal, then it could be argued they had always
been illegal and employers should pay men retrospectively the more generous
pensions paid to women;
Whether pension benefits so contractual that an employer could not equalise
pension ages by worsening benefits for women and effectively cutting their
pay;
If it is permissible to offer men and women different lump sums on
retirement.
The ECJ in February heard arguments in four cases, two of them British.
One of these involved the pension scheme of Coloroll, now in liquidation,
while the other, Neath v Hugh Steeper, involved a former employee of an
artificial limb manufacturer who took early retirement and received a lower
lump sum than a woman would have earned.
The two other cases were from Germany and the Netherlands.
Yesterday the advocate general advised that where pensions are received as a
lump sum upon retirement - then to be used to purchase an annuity  -
employers must not discriminate. Because women on average live longer than
men, they need a bigger lump sum to buy an annuity to provide them with an
equal income for the rest of their lives.
According to consulting actuaries Clay and Partners, the average British
woman lives 20.5 years after retirement at 65, while men will on average
only live 16.5 years past that date. Thus women need roughly 25 per cent
bigger lump sums or must accept a 25 per cent reduction in monthly payments.
In the US, where unisex annuity rates are the law, insurance companies which
sell the policies have simply cut the benefits they offer men to the lower
level of women. 'The European Commission, in its brief to the court, asked
that they take into consideration the US Supreme Court decision,' said Mr
Geoffrey Furlanger, partner at actuaries William M. Mercer in Brussels.
In Denmark, where more than 90 per cent of pensions are paid in lump sums,
the effect could be significant.
Mr Adolph Adolphsen, deputy director of the Association of Danish Insurance
Companies, said the advocate general's recommendation would affect single
people because married people's benefits are calculated jointly. For single
people, it will result in higher pensions for women and lower for men.
Mr John Cunliffe, partner at McKenna and Co and the lead lawyer on the
Coloroll case, said the judgment was good news for employers. However, a
significant number of schemes, have not equalised.
Mr Cunliffe said the greatest effect of the ruling is likely to be on German
employers who have been unable to raise women's retirement ages since the
Barber judgment. This is because they have not yet put into effect laws
which raise state retirement ages for women to 65 and their occupational
pension laws require employers to maintain the same ages as the state.

FT  29 APR 93 / Honda in European sales push: Japanese expansion aimed at
selling 50 per cent more cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONDA, the Japanese carmaker, is seeking to increase its sales in Europe by
more than 50 per cent in the next three years to around 270,000 in 1995 from
180,000 last year.
Mr Yuji Saito, Honda Europe car sales director, said the higher sales would
be driven by rising production from Honda's first European car plant, at
Swindon in the UK.
The expansion of production in Europe by Honda and other Japanese carmakers,
including Nissan and Toyota, is facing mounting resistance from established
carmakers in Europe in the face of steeply falling demand in the west
European new car market. The established carmakers are calling for a sharper
cut in direct vehicle exports from Japan to Europe.
Honda's Pounds 300m car plant, which has been added to the group's Pounds
70m car engine facility at the same site, began production last October and
is due to reach its planned capacity of 100,000 cars a year in 1995.
Mr Saito said that by the mid-1990s Honda planned to export around 150,000
cars a year to Europe from Japan. UK production would total around 100,000 a
year and some 20,000 cars a year would be exported to Europe from Honda
plants in North America.
Some 32,400 Honda Concerto cars were produced in the UK last year under
contract at Rover's assembly plant at Longbridge, Birmingham, but production
will be switched to Honda's Swindon plant from late 1994, with the launch of
a new generation Concerto.
Honda sales were planned to reach 250,000 a year in west Europe and 20,000 a
year in east Europe by 1995, said Mr Saito.
Honda is currently in fourth place among the Japanese carmakers in Europe,
with a 1.3 per cent share of the west European car market in 1992.
The Honda distribution network in Europe is being expanded to cope with the
planned sales growth.
The number of dealers in west Europe is set to rise to 2,000 by 1995 from
1,750 at present, said Mr Saito.
In addition Honda is seeking to establish a 200-strong dealer network in
east Europe by the mid-1990s. Honda is investing Pounds 300m in its UK car
plant and Pounds 70m in its associated engine plant and vehicle inspection
facilities.
By 1995 the Honda plant will have a capacity to produce 100,000 cars and
200,000 engines a year. Some 75,687 engines were produced last year.
Local European content of the UK-produced Honda Accord at Swindon, which is
currently in excess of 60 per cent, is due to rise to 80 per cent by early
next year.

FT  29 APR 93 / Bundesbank trumpets its approach to Emu: Self-confidence in
Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIMMING with confidence in the rightness of its ways, Germany's Bundesbank
has suggested that all other European central banks should adopt its
approach to monetary policy in the interests of a smooth transition to
monetary union.
Unmoved by charges that Bundesbank policy has undermined partner countries'
efforts to escape from recession and helped promote the crisis in the
European monetary system, the bank said following its example would help
keep expansion of the European Community's money supply in line with
productivity growth, and reduce the impact of cyclical swings.
The bank said in its annual report yesterday that despite possible risks,
the lack of convincing alternatives supported the case for a pan-European
strategy steered by medium-term money supply targets.
Adoption of the Bundesbank model by the proposed European system of central
banks (ESCB) would be an especially appropriate way of achieving the
Maastricht treaties' aim of price stability, the report claimed.
At the same time the adoption of the 'Bundesbank's proven concept' would
help quickly to establish the credibility of the ESCB. Given the size of the
monetary territory involved, the report said, such policies appeared to make
even more sense for the proposed system than for a single central bank.
Running through the alternatives, the bank claimed that the scale of the
proposed European union meant a monetary system which tried to set exchange
rate targets was out of the question. Policies based on interest rates had
been proven ineffective in the past.
The suggestions, under the heading 'Thoughts on a European monetary policy
concept', followed persistent nagging from the bank's senior policy-makers
during the past year that the planned central banking system under Emu could
function effectively only if it was seen from the outset to be as
trustworthy and credible as the Bundesbank itself.
The report recommended its concept as a means of determining the interplay
between the proposed European central bank and the 'subordinate' national
institutions.
It also repeated the Bundesbank's defence of its monetary policies with a
claim that softening its stance could have 'raised the pace of inflation
throughout Europe'. As it turned out, its policy was at last beginning to
bear fruit in Germany, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, claimed
in the preface.
While the German measure of money supply, M3, grew wildly out of control for
much of last year, it now appears to have been tamed. Latest monthly figures
show expansion running below the bank's official target range. In the six
months to the end of March, a period including bouts of double-digit growth
in late 1992, M3 has expanded at an annualised rate of 5.5 per cent,
compared with 7.5 per cent in the comparable year-earlier period, the report
said.
But as it made plain in a section on Germany's public finances, there is
more to the management of inflation and monetary policy than steering money
supply between goalposts erected by the Bundesbank's technicians. In a
critique of public financing plans and the bank's first full analysis of the
recent solidarity pact - representing Bonn's efforts to cut ballooning
public deficits while fostering economic recovery in the east - the bank
finds much to worry about.
While federal spending increases this year will be kept to 3 per cent,
compared with the aim of 2.5 per cent, outgoings from regional governments
will rise by up to 5 per cent compared with an original target of 3 per
cent, while local authority spending will go up 4.5 per cent in the west and
almost 10 per cent in the east.
Despite its persistent demands that spending cuts must come before tax
increases, the bank calculates that Bonn's new budget consolidation plans
will in the medium term increase the annual burden of taxes, duties, tolls
and assorted levies by the equivalent of 2 per cent of gross national
product.
As yesterday's report said, future progress in budget consolidation will
depend largely on overall economic developments. And as it added: 'With the
proposed increases in contributions growth prospects for the German economy
have certainly not been improved.'

FT  29 APR 93 / Hoover move to cut costs could threaten Scottish plant
</HEADLINE>

HOOVER EUROPE'S new president is re-examining controversial plans to close a
French plant and switch production to Scotland as part of a sweeping
management review intended to restore the company to profit.
Mr Gerald Kamman said yesterday painful measures would be needed to ensure
the survival of the company, which was continuing to lose heavily in the UK.
He doubted that redundancies could be avoided and said some parts of the
business might have to close.
The review risks seriously embarrassing the British government, which last
January applauded Hoover's decision to move vacuum cleaner production from
Dijon to Cambuslang, near Glasgow, as evidence of the UK's competitiveness
as a manufacturing base.
The decision enraged French authorities, which threatened to take the UK to
the European Court. If Hoover reversed the decision, it might re-inflame
Anglo-French relations.
The Scottish Office has offered Hoover Pounds 2.5m in regional aid, while
Burgundy regional council said yesterday it was ready to make an extra
financial effort to keep the Dijon plant open.
Mr Kamman said no decisions would be taken until the review was completed
next month. He emphasised that 'everything is being reviewed' and that he
believed he was not committed to carrying out the planned transfer of
production.
'These plans were put together by the previous management, and I have to
make my own judgment on whether they make sense,' he said. 'We are going to
have to do whatever is required for the viability of the company. If that
means unwinding some things, we're going to have to unwind them. I wouldn't
rule anything out.'
Mr Kamman said he had not talked to government authorities in Britain or
France. However, the Scottish Office said last night it was staying closely
in touch with Hoover. 'Further developments at Cambuslang are a matter of
considerable importance,' it said.
The AEEU recently negotiated a no-strike deal with Hoover as part of the
planned production transfer.
Mr Jimmy Airlie, Scottish member of the AEEU's executive, urged his members
to remain calm, saying he expected Hoover to honour its agreement.
The three-week review is being carried out by four executives of
Dixie-Narco, the vending machine subsidiary of Maytag, the US
domestic-appliance manufacturer that owns Hoover.
Mr Kamman headed Dixie-Narco until he was appointed president of Hoover
Europe and UK managing director, after the dismissal of his predecessor as a
result of the company's disastrous free flights sales offer.
Mr Kamman said Hoover's losses, 80 per cent of which were in Britain, were
not connected with the costs of the free flights promotion. Maytag had to
make a Dollars 30m (Pounds 18.9m) provision to cover the costs of the
campaign, leading the US company to report a Dollars 10m first-quarter loss.
Although the previous management had reorganised Hoover and sought to
improve its performance, costs were still too high and the UK company's
budget assumed it would make a loss this year, Mr Kamman said. Hoover Europe
lost Dollars 67.1m last year, after a Dollars 55m restructuring charge, on
sales of Dollars 501.9m.
Mr Kamman said the Dijon plant was close to making a manufacturing profit,
and that Cambuslang was performing reasonably well. But overheads in much of
the business had to be cut, and some product lines might have to be dropped.
In a letter to employees, Mr Kamman said there was no option to reducing
costs.
'The measures to accomplish this will have to be very strong and will
require that we run our business in ways never considered before,' the
letter stated.

FT  29 APR 93 / Bundesbank lowers money market rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK yesterday announced a sharp cut in money market interest
rates as the central bank's president warned that further reductions were
being hampered by high public sector deficits.
However, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the bank, also said he believed
the Bundesbank's hard-line monetary policy was at last bearing fruit.
In its first money market operations since it cut the official discount and
Lombard rates on Thursday, the bank reduced the 'repo' rate, at which it
supplies wholesale funds to the markets, to 7.75 per cent after the 8.09 per
cent rate established last week.
The cut was larger than the market had expected and weakened the D-Mark
against some European currencies. Foreign exchange dealers had been
expecting the rate to be reduced to about 7.90 per cent.
The market also predicted further pressures on weaker European currencies
after the Bundesbank announced it wanted a review of European Monetary
System rules which force unlimited intervention to defend weaker currencies.
'The Bundesbank is shifting into another gear on monetary easing,' said Mr
Thomas Mayer, chief economist at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt. The cut
reflected the bank's assessment that it had gone as far as it could in
trying to tackle problems by means of tight interest rate policy, he added.
Mr Schlesinger's remarks appeared to be consistent with recent Bundesbank
tactics of sending mixed signals, partly to keep speculators guessing.
But they also highlighted the bank's underlying concern about government
fiscal policy. In the longer term, heavy government debts forced the central
bank to keep interest rates higher than would otherwise be the case, Mr
Schlesinger said in a television interview.
Other negative effects included a drain on capital available for investment,
and reduced fiscal policy options resulting from high interest repayments.
The first positive results from the bank's 'persistent medium-term monetary
policy' were to be seen in the recent slowing in money supply growth, Mr
Schlesinger wrote in the preface to the Bundesbank's annual report, released
yesterday.
But he stressed that monetary policy had to be supported by all sectors.
'Greater discipline and adaptability in politics, business and among wage
negotiators are all the more necessary . . . since economic output is moving
into reverse,' his statement said.
The bank justified last week's reductions in the discount and Lombard rates
to 7.25 per cent and 8.5 per cent respectively on the grounds that money
supply was coming back under control.
However, most economists took the view that the main motive for the cuts -
the third this year - was the depth of problems in the economy.
The bank's annual report acknowledged that federal budgets would be strained
by lower revenues and the need to increase spending stemming from recession.
However, deficits had to be reduced 'as an important prerequisite for
lasting economic growth', it said.
The report noted that planned increases in tax and welfare contributions,
amounting to the equivalent of 2 per cent of gross national product, 'have
certainly not improved the growth prospects for the German economy'. In a
separate section on lessons to be drawn from last year's crisis in the
European monetary system, the report proposed a review of central banks'
intervention obligations.
The report suggested that the Bundesbank's attempts to control money supply
last year had been blown off course by its intervention commitments, and
complained about the losses incurred when exchange rate adjustments were
finally made.

FT  29 APR 93 / Wandsworth will use supply teachers to carry out tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WANDSWORTH Borough Council announced yesterday that it would bring in teams
of supply teachers to administer national curriculum tests in its four
secondary schools.
The move improves the chance that Mr John Patten, education secretary, can
salvage some meaningful results from this year's testing programme, which
faces the threat of boycotts from three teachers' unions.
It was immediately welcomed by the Department for Education as being 'in the
interests of children and of raising standards'.
Preparation for the tests is already being boycotted by the National
Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers. The appeal court last
week refused Wandsworth's effort to obtain an injunction against the
boycott.
Mr Donald Naismith, the Conservative-controlled borough's director of
education, has written to the headmasters of the schools, who are legally
obliged to implement the tests if possible, offering 'support with the
supervision and marking' of the tests.
He added: 'To abandon all efforts to provide information about pupil
progress this year would be to set back the whole programme two years for
some pupils.'
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NAS/UWT, said he would not
attempt to block Wandsworth's move.
'Effectively, they are bringing in people to help with the workload of the
tests, which is what we wanted all along,' he said. 'It is interesting to
note how extra money can suddenly be found for these purposes. It could set
a very useful precedent to assist teachers with overload in many other areas
as well.'
Opposition to the tests now includes the Professional Association of
Teachers. Mr John Andrews, PAT's general secretary, told Mr Patten that 'any
tests that go ahead now are going to be patchy and incomplete'.
Ms Ann Taylor, shadow secretary for education, said Wands-worth's action was
'incredibly confrontational'. She said she was concerned that Wandsworth
'have learned nothing . . .about the educational reasons for not going ahead
with these tests'.

FT  29 APR 93 / Yeltsin set to remove rebels from split cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday began moving against his conservative
opponents by stripping his rebel vice-president Mr Alexander Rutskoi of his
powers to oversee the government's corruption probe and preparing to sack
conservatives in his divided cabinet.
Mr Yeltsin, who won a convincing victory in Sunday's referendum, is being
urged to move swiftly to consolidate his power base and push ahead with
radical economic reform after warnings this week that Russia faces economic
collapse unless swift action is taken.
The man most at risk is understood to be Mr Georgy Khizha, a deputy prime
minister. His removal would tilt the balance in the cabinet in favour of the
reformist camp.
Mr Yeltsin was also said to have spoken to Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, a first
deputy prime minister, about the possibility of promoting him to prime
minister. Mr Shumeiko is a reformer who has become progressively more
radical since joining the cabinet last June.
Although Mr Yeltsin stopped short of offering the job to Mr Shumeiko, one
radical insider predicted that Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister,
may soon be fighting to save his job.
Mr Chernomyrdin, who has come into conflict with government radicals,
recently compared the privatisation programme to Stalin's bloody
collectivisation policy which destroyed private agriculture.
President Yeltsin's move to strip Mr Rutskoi of the investigation into
fraud, bribery and other official abuses, and take over the investigation
himself, follows a weekend order also removing from the vice-president
responsibility for agriculture.
Mr Rutskoi, who ran on Mr Yeltsin's 1991 election ticket but has crossed
into open opposition, has made sweeping allegations of corruption against
leading government figures in an attempt to damage the president in the
referendum campaign.
He and other leading conservatives have dismissed the outcome of Sunday's
vote, in which Mr Yeltsin won 58 per cent support for his rule and 53 per
cent backing for radical economic reforms begun last year, which have since
lost momentum.
The conservative-dominated Russian parliament, meanwhile voted to set up its
own investigation into corruption, sharpening the confrontation between the
two sides battling for control of power in Russia.
Parliament also ordered the government to dilute the mass privatisation
programme initiated by Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister.
It voted to abolish its economic reform committee, which is filled with
supporters of radical reform. The committee headed by Mr Sergei
Krasavchenko, a Yeltsin supporter, had been instrumental in resisting
attempts by the parliamentary leadership to give more shares to employees as
opposed to the public.
Mr Chubais said yesterday: 'Deputies have finally disengaged themselves from
the people. This is a useless attempt to change the natural course of
events. Life will go in one direction and the parliament will go in
another.'
Mr Andrei Illarionov, deputy head of the radical Centre for Economic Reform,
who was appointed by Mr Chernomyrdin as his economic adviser yesterday, said
the government was duty-bound by the referendum results to return to the
radical reform course begun last year.
'That is my personal desire and understanding of the situation in the
country,' he said in a telephone interview. 'I haven't seen signs yet of a
shift back to radical reform. But it is possible this will be implemented in
the coming few days.'

Meanwhile, Bosnian Serbs said they would bar aid convoys from reaching one

FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Court rules against Gehe bid for
OCP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE complex takeover battle for Office Commerciale Pharmaceutique, France's
biggest drug wholesaler, took a another twist yesterday when a Paris appeal
court ruled against the bid by Gehe, the German drugs wholesaler. This
appears to leave the field open for a Franco-American counterbid launched on
Monday.
The court took exception to the agreement made between Gehe and Mr
Jean-Pierre Duche, who in spite of being recently ousted as nominal head of
OCP controls two companies - SGP and Eurosante - which effectively run OCP's
distribution system in France and abroad.
The agreement stipulated that if Gehe got more than 50 per cent of OCP, it
would also get 75 per cent of the shares in these two companies.
The court said this arrangement unfairly predetermined the outcome of the
takeover bid for OCP. Gehe could not be reached for comment on what its next
step might be. But the court ruling appears to leave the field free to the
counterbid launched by Co-operation Pharmaceutique Francaise (Cooper),
Bergen Brunswig of the US, the Bourely family and the drug laboratories of
such French companies as Rhone Poulenc and Sanofi.
The Cooper-led group has offered FFr 865 a share, compared with the FFr800
originally offered by Gehe, for shares not only in OCP, but also in SGP and
Eurosante.
These latter companies were set up as a defence against hostile takeovers by
Mr Duche under a peculiarly French system known as societes en commandite,
in which the shareholders virtually surrender their rights to managers who
in return assume unlimited liability for the com-pany.
The Cooper bid for OCP may itself face legal problems because it is
conditional on the Cooper group getting 75 per cent of SGP and Eurosante.

FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: RWE hopes to maintain dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL

<DATELINE>
   ESSEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RWE, the German energy-based industrial combine, increased turnover by 2.5
per cent to almost DM40bn (Dollars 25bn) in the first nine months of its
financial year, and hopes to maintain both profits and dividend for the full
year.
Mr Friedhelm Gieske, chief executive, said that poor results in chemicals
and oil refining, and in its printing machinery subsidiaries, had been
offset by good results from construction, and stable figures from energy,
mining and raw materials.
RWE, a former electrical utility and coal-mining operation, had an annual
turnover of DM52bn last year and is the fifth largest industrial group in
Germany.
The company last year paid a dividend of DM12 per share, with group earnings
of DM1.04bn.
Mr Gieske said Consol, the US mining company jointly owned with Du Pont, was
negotiating to buy Island Creek, a coking coal producer owned by Occidental
Petroleum.
He revealed that the rights issue launched by RWE last month - the second
largest in German financial history - raised DM1.64bn, contributing DM1.62bn
to the group cash balances after deducting costs.
Mr Gieske said the money would be used to replenish group liquidity after a
string of acquisitions in recent years, and to help finance an investment
programme in east Germany. It would also help to repay bank debts of Vista,
its US chemicals subsidiary, and provide DM450m for Hochtief, the
construction subsidiary.
The RWE chief used the occasion to restate his company's commitment to
nuclear energy as a component in Germany's power generation, saying it was
essential to ensuring competitive energy costs for the German economy.
He rejected any suggestion that Germany should buy cheaper electricity
supplies from France or eastern Europe - generated from nuclear power
stations - while refusing to build any more such facilities itself.
He confirmed that RWE would ask the European Commission for exemption from
EC competition regulations in its monopoly power-supply contracts with local
authorities in Germany.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ECONOMIC slowdown in Japan, where many employers promise their workers
jobs for life, is leading many companies to restructure their operations,
with two groups yesterday announcing vol-untary redundancy prog-rammes for
staff.
Japan Air Lines said it was opening its early retirement programme, which it
had offered to employees over 45, to employees between the ages of 35 and
44.
Those who apply for early retirement will be awarded a 50 per cent increase
in their retirement pay. The airline hopes to enlist 150 volunteers by the
end of July.
'We have no intention of changing our basic policy of lifetime employment,'
a JAL representative said.
The airline is also offering a one-year leave of absence to managers over 50
to encourage them to consider a second career outside JAL. Managers who make
use of the programme will be paid in full and are under no obligation to
leave the company, the airline said.
JAL is suffering from a sharp downturn in business, with a fall-off in
first-class air travel and intense price competition on international
routes.
The company is expected to have made a Y50bn (Pounds 294m) pre-tax loss for
the year to March, the worst result it has reported, and has signalled its
intention to restructure its operations.
It has postponed the recruitment of stewardesses this April and announced
that it will not recruit administrative staff and stewardesses next year.
Meanwhile Alps Electric, the electrical parts manufacturer, and its
subsidiary, Tohoku Alps, are looking to cut their workforce by 12 per cent,
or 1,300 employees, through a voluntary redundancy programme announced
yesterday.
All employees with a year or more of service are eligible for 'retirement'.
Alps is closing three factories in northern Japan and reducing new recruits
next year to 100 from a previous 400. Production at the factories, where
Alps manufactures volume controls and switches, will be transferred to
nearby plants and a facility in South Korea.
Alps also plans to start production through a joint venture in China soon.
The company has been hit by a sharp fall in the electrical appliance and
motor industries which it supplies and expects to see pre-tax profits fall
by about 70 per cent in the year to March to Y2.1bn.
It said it had seen an increase in orders since last year but the recent
strong rise of the yen had led to a drop in orders.

<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE Aerospace yest-day signed a contract giving it a 51 per cent stake
in Dutch aeroplane builder Fokker, ending negotiations which lasted more
than a year and touched off an industrial policy debate in the Netherlands.
The only hurdle to German-Dutch co-operation in aircraft building is the
European Commission, whose official reaction to the transaction is expected
in mid-May. 'We are quite hopeful that it will be positive,' said Mr Jurgen
Schrempp, president of Dasa.
Dasa, part of the Daimler-Benz group, is taking a 51 per cent stake in a new
holding company which will own Fokker's shares. This will be done through
the purchase of new shares and the acquisition of most of the Dutch state's
32 per cent stake. The government, Dasa's main negotiating partner, will
keep a small holding for a three-year transition.

FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Norsk Data shares to be delisted
in Oslo

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Norsk Data, the Norwegian computer service group, will be delisted
from the Oslo bourse from May 3. The main reason behind the move is that the
group's share capital has been wiped out, the bourse said.
At the end of December, Norsk Data had negative equity, including deferred
taxes, of NKr474m (Dollars 71.6m). Bourse officials also said an
out-of-court financial restructuring of Norsk Data, agreed with Den norske
Bank and Fokus Bank, two of Norway's top three commercial banks and the
group's main creditors, was behind the decision.
Under the restructuring, Norsk Data will pay a cash dividend of 25 per cent
of what is owed to unsecured creditors. DnB and Fokus agreed to refinance
Norsk Data's outstanding debt of NKr600m, of which NKr300m is in German
bearer bonds. A share issue is to be undertaken by partly converting debt to
equity.
The six-year crisis in Norway's banking sector is set to continue, although
it is no longer acute, according to Mr Finn Hvistendahl, chief executive of
Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest bank.
Mr Hvistendahl made the remarks at the annual meeting of the Norwegian Banks
Association, the lobbying arm of the commercial banks of which he was
yesterday elected chairman for a second term.
He challenged the government to end competitive distortion in Norway's bank
sector by dismantling annual state subsidies of an estimated NKr5bn, given
in the form of subsidised interest rates to non-commercial state banks.
Mr Hvistendahl also called on the government to create conditions which
would allow the commercial banks to be reprivatised. Over the past six
years, the state has injected more than NKr27bn into the banks to rescue
them from insolvency.
This has resulted in the state acquiring Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank,
the country's second and third biggest commercial banks, and increasing its
stake in DnB to 70 per cent from 55 per cent. Over the last two years of
crisis, the commercial banks have been forced to reduce their balance sheets
by by 15 per cent and the number of branches by 40 per cent. This has meant
cost reductions of 30 per cent since 1988.

HOODED men holding 19 Costa Rican Supreme Court judges at gunpoint were
demanding Dollars 20m and safe passage out of the country, officials said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Costa Rica.
News reports said the hostage-takers were linked to Colombian cocaine barons
and wanted the release of, among others, Colombian drug boss Mr Carlos
Urquijo, who was captured in Costa Rica last September. At least five
heavily armed men burst into the Supreme Court on Monday and seized the
judges as they held a weekly meeting.

FT  28 APR 93 / Dutch bank head wants sharp cut in budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Dutch central bank has called for the country's budget deficit to be cut
to well below 3 per cent of gross domestic product, one of the main
convergence criteria for creation of European monetary union later this
decade.
Mr Wim Duisenberg, central bank president, said the Dutch budget deficit
should be kept below this European ceiling 'by a considerable margin',
partly to help accelerate reduction of public debt.
In 1992, the Dutch budget deficit was equivalent to roughly 3.8 per cent of
GDP, while public debt stood at 80 per cent of GDP, well above the Emu
target of 60 per cent.
Speaking at the presentation of the bank's annual report, Mr Duisenberg said
the government formed after next year's general election should aim to make
a 'substantial further reduction' in the deficit during its four-year term
in office.
He noted that the Dutch government had so far managed to reduce the budget
deficit in line with its annual targets, though this was sometimes achieved
by raising taxes and social security premiums rather than cutting spending.
'However, it is with concern that the bank notes that in our country, too,
discipline is in danger of slackening,' he said.
Last week in Basle, Mr Duisenberg, who is chairman of the committee of
European Community central bank governors, warned of the dangers of a
widespread 'structural deterioration' in state finances around Europe.
In its report, the Dutch bank cites population ageing as a reason why the
Netherlands should try to cut the deficit below the Emu ceiling and so gain
control over interest payments on the national debt, which now absorb 6 per
cent of GDP. 'Through lower interest payments, deficit reduction to a level
significantly below 3 per cent of GDP would provide some leeway to cope with
this pressure on expenditure which will inevitably have to be faced in the
future,' it said.

FT  28 APR 93 / Greek exporters fear heavy losses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NORTHERN Greek exporters claimed yesterday they will face heavy losses as a
result of losing access to transit routes through Serbia with the tightening
of United Nations sanctions.
The government said Greece intended to seek compensation from both the UN
and the EC for sanctions-related losses.
At present, about 40 per cent of exports from northern Greece to the
European Community, the country's main trading partner, are carried by truck
through Macedonia and southern Serbia, then through Hungary and the Czech
republic, an official from the Exporters' Association of Northern Greece
said.
Trucks will now have to follow a longer route to Hungary through Bulgaria
and Romania, taking 24 hours longer and adding up to 20 per cent to freight
costs, the official said.
Moreover, imports of raw materials for northern Greek industry, will also be
affected. About 1,600 trucks used to arrive every week in Thessalonika, the
region's industrial centre, after transiting through Serbia.
Although some exporters started shipping goods by ferry from western Greece
to Italy after conflict broke out in the former Yugoslavia in mid-1991, more
than 20,000 Greek trucks used the route through Serbia last year.
The ferry route is mainly used by exporters based in southern Greece.

FT  28 APR 93 / IG Metall to pick targets for strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE leaders of IG Metall, Germany's powerful engineering union, will decide
tomorrow where in eastern Germany to call strikes in support of higher wages
in the region.
Where the strikes are held will depend on voting by steel industry members
throughout the five eastern German states and by members in the metal and
electrical industries in Saxony and Mecklenburg Western Pomerania.
Union officials, and Gesamtmetall, the metal and electrical employers'
association, expect more than 75 per cent to back strike action.
Gesamtmetall said: 'The trends show that IG Metall will get what it wants -
support for a strike - despite the high economic cost.' IG Metall saidits
information from the steel sector indicated strong support. Results of the
balloting will be known today.
The strikes could start as early as May 3 and will be the first of their
kind in eastern Germany since the 1930s. They are intended to put pressure
on Gesamtmetall and Arbeitgeberverband Stahl, the steel employers, to change
their minds about ending a contract designed to equalise western and eastern
wages by April 1994.
The contract was signed in March 1991 between west German employers, eastern
German managers, and IG Metall. But the employers have said they can no
longer meet large pay claims because of recession in the west and lower
economic expectations in the east.
The contract envisaged giving employees in the metal and electrical sectors
in eastern Germany a 26 per cent pay rise, and a 21 per cent rise for those
in the steel sector, beginning April 1 this year. These increases are
calculated on wage levels which existed in March 1991, as well as west
German pay increases since that date.
Wages for east Germans in these two sectors are below 70 per cent of west
German levels.

FT  28 APR 93 / E German investment inflow to rise 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of the deepening recession in west Germany, investment in the
eastern part of the country is expected to increase by almost 20 per cent
this year, to more than DM135bn (Dollars 80bn), according to a new survey.
The rate of increase in investment has declined, after a jump of 33 per
cent, from DM84.5bn in 1991 to DM112.8bn in 1992, according to the
Munich-based Ifo economic research institute.
West German enterprises contributed DM41.8bn to the total investment in
1992, and are expected to invest DM48.9bn this year, with the recession
undoubtedly causing a number of plans to be cut back, but with commitments
still pushing up the total.
The main areas of new investment in the massive inflow of cash to the former
Communist East Germany are transport and communications (DM22bn in 1992 and
DM24bn in 1993), manufacturing industry (DM22bn and DM26.5bn respectively),
and service enterprises, including housing for rent, (DM28.2bn and
DM34.3bn).
Ifo's calculations are based on a compilation of sources, including
published investment plans of west German enterprises, information from
foreign investors, the Treuhand privatisation agency, the federal statistics
office, and Ifo's own investment surveys.
The institute's initial calculations of private enterprise investment in
mid-1992 proved slightly over-optimistic, and had to be revised downwards by
some DM5bn in the latest survey - primarily reflecting lower investment in
manufacturing industry. Housing investment, in contrast, expanded faster
than first forecast.
The figures reflect heavy investment by public sector enterprises, including
the Treuhand agency itself, seeking to restructure eastern companies for
privatisation, by the German railways, and by Deutsche Telekom, the
telecommunications monopoly.
In 1993, the west German eletricity utilities are expected to invest some
DM13bn in overhauling the eastern grid and power stations, an increase of
one third on the current year.
Germany's inflation rate stayed stubbornly high in April for the fourth
month running, Reuter reports from Frankfurt.
Preliminary figures showed annual west German inflation in April rose
slightly to 4.3 per cent - at the top end of most expectations - from 4.2
per cent in March. The federal statistics office said prices rose 0.3 per
cent in April, the same rate as the previous month.

FT  28 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities turn higher towards the
close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE picture suddenly bright-ened towards the close of dealings on the London
stock market yesterday when gilt-edged prices turned firmer, signalling a
more optimistic view of today's auction of Pounds 3bn of government
securities. Also helping share prices was the official US support for the
dollar, which reversed an initial gain in the pound, and also a sizeable buy
programme of UK equities from a leading US investment bank.
While trading volumes remained unexciting, the FT-SE 100 Index bounced
successfully at 2,812 to replace its early loss of 10 points with a gain of
similar proportions. The final reading put the index at 2,832.7, a net rise
of 10.4. Stock index futures helped to fuel the recovery in equities.
The London market was surprised by the appearance of the buying programme
from the US because much of its recent weakness appeared to originate from
across the Atlantic. An estimated value of around Pounds 125m was put on the
programme, in which the battered pharmaceutical sector rated highly; some
looked for favourable developments on the Clinton administration's
healthcare plans.
Earlier in the day, one of the leading London-based securities houses also
operated a large programme. Since many of the trades in both programmes were
protected trades, the details did not appear on the trading screens until
the end of the session, when they spurred the general recovery.
The programmes helped to boost equity turnover, as reported by the Seaq
system, to 596.6m shares yesterday from the 491.9m recorded on Monday, when
retail business only just scraped above the Pounds 1bn mark now established
as a daily minimum. Dealers are hopeful that equities will regain the centre
of the stage when today's gilt-edged auction is out of the way.
With the recent outbreak of bid speculation less active yesterday - United
Biscuits came off the boil - the market returned its attention to the basic
prospects of the economy and of corporate earnings.
Once again, the stock market paid little heed to signs of economic optimism,
making scant response to the latest industrial trends survey by the
Confederation of British Industry, which said that business confidence had
shown its highest monthly rise for a decade. Corporate trading figures from
the retail and building sectors brought no surprises for equities.
Caution regarding the market outlook was expressed at an investment
conference hosted in London by Kleinwort Benson Securities. The consensus of
fund managers was that the FT-SE 100 would be 7 per cent higher at 3,040 at
the year-end, and 13 per cent up at 3,190 in 12 months' time.
Potential problems of liquidity were raised by managers' inclinations to
increase holdings of Japanese equities, with London perhaps vulnerable in
view of impending cash demands for the government's funding programme, as
well as for planned fund-raising in equities by Zeneca and BT.
Against this backcloth, strategists pointed out that this week has seen the
Footsie drift down towards the low end of its trading range and a recovery
was to be expected; the question remains whether the market can successfully
challenge the existing year's high points in the 2,957 area.

FT  28 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Owners visit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rumblings of dissent were being heard in the leisure sector as analysts
returned from a visit to downgrade Owners Abroad, the tour operator which
recently fought off a hostile bid from rival Airtours. Part of Owners'
defence was its bullish outlook on trading and the cost savings after its
tie-up with Thomas Cook.
While the company was said to be positive on current trading, some analysts
expressed surprise at the size of the exceptional cost items, including the
defence costs from the bid and reorganisational costs from the Thomas Cook
deal. Most downgraded their forecasts by between Pounds 3m to Pounds 6m, to
a range of Pounds 27m to Pounds 33m for 1993. Profits last year were Pounds
25m.
'If we had known the size of these extra cost figures during the bid,
Airtours would have walked it,' said one disgruntled analyst. Owners shares
shrugged off the negative talk and stayed steady at 111p. Airtours was also
unmoved, at 286p.
Stagecoach Holdings, the Scottish-based coach company, continued the long
list of highly successful stock market flotations this year. The shares,
placed at 112p, opened at 123p and were heavily traded all day, ending at
124p. Turnover reached 13m.
There were no big surprises for the market in Tarmac's results, which showed
a heavy Pounds 350m loss but a maintained dividend and no rights issue.
Dealers said the big provisions had been well flagged for many weeks and the
market was encouraged by the bullish statement accompanying the figures.
Tarmac rose 8 to 141p on high turnover of 6.5m.
Travis Perkins forged ahead 13 to 218p after maintaining the dividend in
spite of the sharp fall in profits.
Results from Sears were in line with market expectations. BZW upgraded the
stores group by Pounds 8m to Pounds 123m for 1993 and to Pounds 144m for
1994. Boots recovered from Monday's mauling over its Manoplax drug, the
shares improving 5 to 469p. Analysts said the US Food and Drug
Administration had put the drug back on its emergency agenda. It is to be
discussed on June 3.
Asda saw hefty turnover of 33m shares and the stock eased a halfpenny to 72
1/2 p. Dealers said good two-way business focused on the depth of the
supermarket group's recovery.
The Pounds 85m convertible bond from Forte is likely to lead to investors
switching out of the ordinary shares and into the higher yielding
investment. The shares slipped 2 to 194 1/2 p.
Results from Euro Disney, the French theme park operator, were badly
received and the stock fell 38 to 895p. Mr Nigel Reed at Paribas said an
equity-raising excercise was vital to the heavily indebted group, as was the
need to proceed with the second phase of the park's development. He
suggested a convertible bond issue and help from the US Walt Disney group.
Encouraging comments by Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster, at
the bank's annual meeting in London triggered a flurry of support for the
shares and helped the rest of the sector make good progress.
The comment from Lord Alexander that 'we are over the worst as far as UK bad
debts are concerned' saw NatWest pick up to close a net 5 higher at 473p on
relatively heavy turnover of 6.3m.
Barclays also performed well, adding 7 at 438p on 6.5m traded, while Lloyds
rose 11 to 534p. HSBC, however, eased 3 to 612p. TSB gave up 2 to 187p, but
there remained persistent talk in the market that a European predator may
still be stalking the UK bank.
Jeweller Ratners jumped 4 1/4 to 24 1/4 p on turnover of 5.8m as the market
reacted to rumoured good trading news from Zales in the US.
Leading textile group Coats Viyella held steady at 238p ahead of a buy note
from one securities house which is due out today and said to value the
shares at around 260p.
Shanks &amp; McEwan was heavily traded after a securities house bought 8.5m
shares from one institution at 183p a share and placed them with a variety
of institutional clients at 186p, a 10p discount to the market price. Smith
New Court, which specialises in large pre-arranged trades, made around
Pounds 250,000 from the deal. Shanks shed 6 to 194p.
Troubled specialty chemicals company MTM, which saw its share price collapse
last year, slipped a further halfpenny to 11 1/2 p on suggestions of a
statement today.
British Aerospace gained 6 at 322p after upbeat comments from the group's
chairman at its annual general meeting.
McKechnie, the plastics and components group, eased 3 to 423p after making a
recommended offer for USM-quoted Savage, manufacturer and distributor of
home improvement accessories, valuing it at approximately Pounds 47.2m.
Savage rose 6 to 77p.

FT  28 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Official turnover in ICI shares was cut by the opening of a new unofficial
market offering prices for the two parts of the company due to be split
shortly.
US brokerage Salomon Brothers was yesterday offering a price for Zeneca, the
bioscience side of ICI, of around 705p. For the new slimmed down ICI the
firm was quoting 525p in early trading, rising to 535p by the close.
The 'grey' market is expected to run until May 28. Demerged Zeneca is set to
see its shares begin trading on June 1 following a Pounds 1.3bn rights
offer. No other securities houses were said to be quoting prices yesterday,
although some conceded that there had been considerable institutional
interest, particularly from the US. The joint valuation of 1240p is in line
with many forecasts, but some analysts said the split undervalued the
chemicals side and overvalued Zeneca. ICI shed 3 to 1234p on turnover of
1.5m.

Pharmaceutical issues moved sharply higher in late afternoon trading
following a surge of buying in New York yesterday. London dealers of
internationally traded stocks said the market was enlivened by suggestions
that the proposed US reforms would be watered down.
Dealers said there had been suggestions that the reforms would be delayed.
They added that any delays in the impending health service review which has
formed one of the main planks of the Clinton administration made it more
likely that changes would be watered down.
There was further support from a Pounds 125m programme trade, said to have
been carried out by Goldman Sachs and featuring drug stocks heavily. Glaxo
advanced 17 to 594p and SmithKline Beecham added 14 1/2 at 460 1/2p.

FT  28 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Setback for CU shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMPACT of last Saturday's bomb explosion continued to reverberate in the
City as Commercial Union shares fell sharply on the disclosure that the
insurer has not taken out reinsurance cover for terrorist attacks on its
pre-1993 policies.
CU said yesterday that it was lead insurer for the NatWest Tower and for the
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking building. 'CU has scored a rather spectacular
own goal,' said one leading insurance analyst.
The company is thought by insurance specialists to be liable for losses
greater than the Pounds 15m it paid out for the bomb damage caused by an IRA
attack in the City of London last year. Analysts are expected to cut current
year profits estimates for CU by between Pounds 30m and Pounds 50m, although
the latter figure is seen as a worst case figure.
On Monday, the composite sector gave ground, but more on the overall market
decline than any worries about Saturday's bomb, which dealers then believed
would have only limited impact on the insurers. Following the 1992 bomb
attack in the City, the insurance companies set up Pool Re, a mutual
reinsurance company, to manage a joint terrorism fund.
CU dropped 15 to 593p yesterday, although turnover was an unspectacular 1.4m
shares.

FUTURES dealers continued to adopt a pessimistic view of the short-term
outlook for the UK market as the June contract traded in a narrow range for
most of a quiet session, writes Christopher Price.
Following a downward end to Monday's session and a weak overnight Wall
Street, June opened down at 2,818, a key resistance level for the contract.
From there, support was found and June was bought upwards.
It rallied to a mid-morning high of 2,834, before starting to come off as
buyers drifted away and a number of sellers were seen.
The CBI survey added to the market's sullen mood, fuelling renewed fears of
inflation and putting paid to any further interest rate cuts, a fact
underlined by the latest IMF view of the UK economy.
June's slow drift downwards continued with a weak opening on Wall Street,
although a rally towards the end brought some relief. The contract closed at
2,826, up 8 points from the previous session and around a point below its
estimated fair value premium of 6. Turnover came to 8,927 contracts, a
slight improvement from Monday's level.
BP was the most heavily traded stock option, reaching 3,999 contracts. This
included a trade of 3,000 July 280 puts at 12p and 13p. Lonrho was busy
again, with 2,240 lots transacted, followed by United Biscuits on 1,311 and
British Aerospace on 1,206.

FT  28 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rallies as recent selling
spree abates

Wall Street
THE RECENT selling spree on Wall Street ended yesterday afternoon in spite
of continuing concern about the economic outlook, writes Karen Zagor in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial average closed 17.56 higher at 3,415.93 after
posting losses through much of the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up
4.32 at 437.86, while the Nasdaq composite finished 6.65 ahead at 652.52.
Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 284m shares and rises narrowly
outscored declines by 950 to 934.
Stocks withstood pressure from continuing declines in US bond prices, with
the treasury's bellwether 30-year bond sliding  29/32 to 102 27/32 , pushing
its yield up to 6.895 per cent.
Owens-Corning Fiberglass advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 39 1/8 after
saying it had cancelled a proposed public offering of 4.5m shares of common
stock. The company blamed market conditions for its decision but said its
plan 'to pursue its growth agenda remains unchanged'.
Xerox tumbled Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 75 after announcing that US sales
were hit in the first quarter by a reorganisation of the sales force.
In the drugs sector, share prices benefited from reports that the Clinton
administration may enter voluntary cost- control agreements with the
industry, instead of imposing price controls without industry consent.
Merck added Dollars 1 at Dollars 37 1/8 , Pfizer climbed Dollars 3 7/8 to
Dollars 67 3/4 , Bristol-Myers Squibb appreciated Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars
61 7/8 and Glaxo Holdings firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 18 5/8 .
Biotechnology issues also advanced in Nasdaq trading, Chiron adding Dollars
4 1/2 at Dollars 54 1/2 and Amgen Dollars 2 7/8 at Dollars 41.
Bank shares recovered some of the ground lost on Monday when investors moved
away after a strong run this year. Citicorp was up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars
26 7/8 , BankAmerica gained Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 45 3/8 , Banc One
improved Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 53 3/4 and Chase Manhattan put on Dollars
1/2 at Dollars 30 5/8 .
The transport segment also recouped some of its losses, with the Dow Jones
Transportation average recovering 18.93 to 1,599.48 after dropping 37.47 on
Monday.
AMR, parent of American Airlines, ended Dollars 2 1/4 better at Dollars 69
1/4 , UAL, parent of United Airlines, climbed Dollars 7 1/8 to Dollars 146
1/2 and Delta Air Lines was ahead Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 58 3/8 .
In Nasdaq trading, Intel regained Dollars 4 5/8 at Dollars 92 after falling
Dollars 5 1/4 on Monday. Apple Computer moved forward Dollars 1 1/4 to
Dollars 50 1/4 and Lotus Development rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 25.
Canada
THE TORONTO market ended mixed after active trading, having shown little
reaction to the federal budget, released after Monday's close. The budget
was criticised by business leaders for failing to include major spending
cuts.
The TSE 300 index was up a net 7.4 at 3,691.2 after spending the bulk of the
day in negative territory, but falls led rises by 381 to 306. Volume fell to
63.3m shares from 81.5m.
Nine of the 14 stock groups ended higher, but the energy and gold shares
sectors relinquished some ground.
Northern Telecom rose CDollars 1 1/4 to CDollars 44 3/8 after the
telecommunication group posted earnings that were not as bleak as the market
had feared.

FT  28 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: India drops sharply ahead of budget
vote - RC Murthy writes on Indian equities and John Pitt on emerging markets
in March
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RC MURTHY and JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concern over the stability of the Narasimha Rao administration has come once
again to the forefront as parliament reassembled last week for the crucial
vote on this year's Indian budget, driving equities to a 15-month low.
The Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janta party, the main opposition, has
announced plans to try to unseat the administration, and other parties are
threatening to join in.
However, none of these opponents wants mid-term elections and it appears
that a compromise may be reached which could see the budget through
parliament during the next fortnight.
Equity prices have fallen due to the uncertainty, with the BSE index down at
2,100 at the weekend.
Prices dropped by a further 63 points on Monday, bringing the total decline
to 423 points, or 17 per cent, in six weeks. The BSE indicator yesterday
recovered some ground, finishing 33.19 up at 2,070.00.
The focus now is on the R40bn (Dollars 1.3bn) Bombay securities scandal and
deliberations of the joint parliamentary committee, which is to finalise its
report in a fortnight.
Venezuela and India featured as the worst performers among the world's
emerging markets in March, while Mexico, supported by lower inflation and
interest rates, moved ahead.
Disappointment with the February 27 budget, which did not cut corporation
tax as had been widely expected, contributed to India's downward drift.
According to data supplied by the IFC, part of the World Bank, the market
registered a 17.6 per cent fall in dollar terms on the month.
Mr Nigel Spence, emerging markets equity analyst at Lehman Brothers in
London, commented that other negative factors during March included:
a series of bomb explosions in Bombay which caused extensive damage to the
stock exchange and increased tension between India and Pakistan. Owing to
the uncertain political climate there was likely to be a slowdown in foreign
cash inflows into the country, he added;
expectations of disappointing company results, particularly in the car,
steel and cement sectors after the cancellation of a number of
infrastructure projects as the government attempts to reduce the budget
deficit.
Venezuela remained uneasy in an uncertain political environment, and with
foreign investors removing capital the central bank was forced to lift
interest rates during the month. Towards the end of March, notes Mr
Frederico Laffan of Latin American Securities, the market staged a modest
recovery on bargain hunting, although volume remained low.
Mexico's rally continued, helped by hopes for Nafta approval in the US, and
lower inflation and interest rates.

FT  28 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Italy and France feature
modest gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MILAN again featured strongly among the continent's bourses, writes Our
Markets Staff.
MILAN continued ahead in heavy trading but finished off the day's highs as
the market awaited confirmation that prime minister designate Carlo Ciampi
would be able to form a government. The Comit index finished 5.99 ahead at
547.25.
Mr Fabio Ferrando of Albertini in Milan said: 'The performance of the market
speaks for itself in terms of what investors think of the appointment. Since
the economy is the priority, Mr Ciampi is perceived as the right man in the
right place.'
But Mr Gian Luca Manca of Baring Securities in London cautioned that the
market would remain restrained until it knew the composition of a proposed
cabinet and Mr Ciampi's administration had won parliamentary approval.
The telecommunications sector, facing restructuring, continued its recent
rally. Stet attracted strong foreign interest, rising L88 or 3.4 per cent to
L2,670, for a week's rise of 9.6 per cent.
PARIS advanced with a strong rise in Elf Aquitaine being noted. The oil
group has been rumoured in recent days as possibly interested in increasing
its stake in Petrofina, but with this now seeming increasingly unlikely the
shares put on FFr14.10 or nearly 4 per cent to FFr374. The CAC-40 index rose
15.79 to 1,927.41 in turnover of FFr2.35bn.
Euro Disney went against the trend with a fall of FFr2.25 or 2.8 per cent to
FFr76 after reporting a six month loss to March of FFr1bn, which did not
come as a complete surprise. The group also said that it was trying to
secure new capital.
Mr Nigel Reed of Paribas commented that with gearing standing at some 350
per cent, if one included off balance sheet financing and long-term debt,
the group's prospects for the rest of the year remained very difficult.
FRANKFURT lost ground in thin trading as investors remained sidelined amid a
spate of corporate announcements. The DAX index fell 9.03 to 1,640.78 in
turnover of DM6.5bn against DM6bn.
AMSTERDAM was only interested in Akzo which came in with first quarter
figures much in line with or slightly better than expectations. The shares
showed a strong finish, having fallen to a day's low of Fl 152.60, rising Fl
4.40 to Fl 157.30, but largely on short-covering. The CBS Tendency index
fell 0.7 to 108.7.
BELGIUM closed marginally lower with activity led by Petrofina. The Bel-20
index retreated 4.57 to 1,205.93.
Petrofina was unchanged at BFr8,790, after plunging to BFr8,570 on reports
that its profits for the current year would not exceed last year's.
Susan Scott, oil and gas analyst at James Capel, said that in spite of the
buying interest related to speculation of a takeover bid, Petrofina's
fundamentals remained poor.
ZURICH continued lower amid a lack of buying interest and the SMI index shed
14.3 to 2,124.7. The recently volatile Ascom fell SFr180 or 11.5 per cent to
SFr1,380 after announcing an unexpected SFr46m loss late on Monday.
MADRID's general index rose 2.24 to 243.95 helped by a slightly stronger
peseta, although the prospect of devaluation remains.
ISTANBUL jumped 3.1 per cent with the market index 216.09 higher at
7,229.11.
OSLO saw the All Share index rising above the 460 level for the first time
since January 1992, closing up 6.15 or 1.35 per cent, at 461.20. STOCKHOLM
fell for the third consecutive session, the Affarsvarlden index down 10.9,
or 1.1 per cent, to 1,008.8, while HELSINKI's HEX index firmed 3.5 to
1,155.7.

FT  28 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei surges 2.9% in
run-up to Golden Week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BROAD buying by public fund managers and foreign investors triggered a rally
that boosted equity prices by 2.9 per cent on the first day of the new
trading account, writes Wayne Aponte.
The Nikkei average ended 583.08 ahead at 20,206.71, after trading between an
intraday low of 19,642.41 and a high of 20,267.84. The last time the stock
market settled above 20,000 was on April 19. The Topix index of all first
section stocks was up 36.91 at 1,572,68, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50
index firmed 1.03 to 1,241.83.
Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was estimated at
600m shares, compared with Monday's final 299m. Advances overwhelmed
declines by 1,004 to 87, with 84 issues unchanged.
Market sentiment turned bullish from the outset when public fund managers
and foreign securities companies placed heavy buy orders. The advance
squeezed market participants who had been expecting the Nikkei to trade
lower and encouraged dealers, individual investors and investment trust
managers to join the rally.
Analysts said there were no fundamental factors fuelling the day's
impressive gains, but a steady yen against the dollar provided the stock
market with stability.
One analyst at a Japanese brokerage said many investors now expected the
Nikkei to hold current levels before the Golden Week holiday, which begins
tomorrow. He added that government buying through public funds would
discourage investors from selling the market short.
Non-ferrous metal issues rose in tandem with gold futures prices. Dowa
Mining added Y12 at Y655 and Mitsui Mining and Smelting gained Y8 at Y518.
But Sumitomo Metal and Mining, the most active issue of the day, ended
unchanged at Y990.
Investors bought blue chips in the telecommunications sector on reports of a
special provision in the government's budget for fiscal 1994 to improve new
kinds of infrastructure. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y50,000 to
Y973,000, Nippon Comsys Y90 to Y1,290 and NEC Y49 to Y980.
The day's buying spree also lifted the brokerages: Nomura appreciated Y100
to Y2,110, Daiwa Y50 to Y1,280 and Nikko Y47 to Y1,040.
In Osaka, the OSE average finished 493.65 higher at 21,923.14 in volume of
22.7m shares.
Roundup
IN the Pacific Rim, investors found a range of reasons to sell and markets
finished lower on the day.
BANGKOK tumbled as worries heightened over an expanded investigation of the
wid-ening stock manipulation scandal. The SET index fell 13.70, or 1.6 per
cent, to 869.98 in turnover of Bt3.4bn. Investors grew increasingly cautious
as the Securities and Exchange Commission, which filed charges last week,
was poised to increase its list of suspected stock manipulators.
HONG KONG eased as cautious investors realised profits ahead of the second
round of Sino-British talks starting today. The Hang Seng index closed 8.87
down at 6,836.88 in turnover of HKDollars 5.1bn, against Monday's HKDollars
6.8bn.
Bank shares, which have led the recent rise, lost ground on profit-taking.
HSBC Holdings receded HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 72.50.
SINGAPORE retreated on profit-taking after hitting a record intraday high in
early trading. The Straits Times Industrial index was finally 10.63 off at
1,786.63.
AUSTRALIA declined as the rally in gold issues lost steam, prompting
profit-taking in recent gainers. The All Ordinaries index slipped 5.4 to
1,704.7 in turnover of ADollars 318.6m.
Higher gold bullion prices supported Newcrest Mining, which added 35 cents
at ADollars 3.27, but Commonwealth Bank, after recent strong gains,
relinquished 28 cents to ADollars 8.12.
SEOUL moved lower for the fourth consecutive trading day in thin volume as
further profit-taking was seen. The composite index shed 7.96 to 722.96 in
thin turnover of Won527.72bn.
KUALA LUMPUR was also subjected to profit-taking as some investors grew
cautious over a further rise in the market. The composite index eased 0.87
to 692.57, while volume contracted to 462.6m shares from 510.2m.
MANILA closed moderately softer amid concern over prolonged power blackouts,
but traders said overall sentiment remained firm. The composite index lost
3.02 to 1,549.39 in turnover of 369.5m pesos, against 333.9m pesos.
TAIWAN weakened in quiet trading. The weighted index ended 41.67 down at
4,506.11 in turnover of TDollars 27.1bn. Brokers commented that talks taking
place between Taiwan and China in Singapore had had little effect on the
market.

FT  28 APR 93 / Money Markets: Optimism on Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS a modest rise in German futures yesterday after comments from the
Bundesbank president suggested a change of attitude towards interest rates,
writes James Blitz.
In a newspaper interview, Mr Helmut Schlesinger said the Bundesbank had to
test how far it could keep cutting interest rates. He added that Germany's
economic situation had deteriorated, and that this had to be taken into
account in the setting of money market rates.
These comments, and expectations of a sharp reduction in the Bundesbank's
repo rate at its weekly money market intervention, combined to improve
conditions in both the German cash and futures markets.
The Bundesbank announced that it would be conducting a variable rate repo in
its weekly money market operations today.
The lowest accepted repo rate last week was 8.11 per cent. Many dealers
expected the rate to fall to below 8 per cent tomorrow.
Mr Adrian James, an economist at NatWest Markets in London, said: 'If it
comes below 7.90 per cent, that will be taken as a bullish signal that the
Bundesbank has moved away from gradual easing to something more aggressive.'
The June Euromark contract rose 6 basis points on the day to close at 92.67,
while the September contract climbed 13 basis points to end at 93.53. German
call money finished a touch easier at 7.57 per cent, from a previous 7.60
per cent.
The French franc market was unaffected by the move, with the June contract
closing one basis point higher at 91.99.
Conditions in the sterling market were a good deal easier. Mr Schlesinger's
comments implied that the UK might have more scope to ease policy if it
wished.
The June short sterling contract moved up six basis points to finish at
93.89. Three-month money closed  1/16 per cent lower at 6 1/16 per cent. The
overnight lending rate was seen as low as 5 per cent after a Pounds 1bn
shortage forecast by the Bank of England was easily removed by the discount
market.
However, a continuing raft of good economic data has helped to keep a lid on
expectations of a base rate cut. The Confederation of British Industry
yesterday said UK companies are enjoying their biggest increase in
confidence for 10 years.

FT  28 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Fed intervenes on dollar/yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR bounced back against the yen in yesterday's afternoon trading in
Europe after the US Federal Reserve intervened to support its currency for
the first time this year, writes James Blitz.
The Fed bought dollars in the market after the US currency set another
all-time low against the yen of Y109.15 in New York. The intervention took
the market by surprise, pushing the dollar up to a London close of Y111.2.
In New York it ended at Y111.75.
The move by the Fed was seen as extremely significant, one which might even
signal the end of the yen rally seen in recent weeks.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, said there had been a
misperception about US exchange rate policy in recent weeks. He added that
finance ministers of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations would
issue a communique on exchange rates after their meeting tomorrow.
Mr Mark Brett, an economist at BZW in London, said the Clinton
administration might think the continuing depreciation of the dollar would
have only a limited impact on the Japanese trade surplus. 'The US may be
taking the view that the trade imbalance has more to do with structural
problems relating to products, rather than anything to do with exchange
rates.'
Mr Jim O'Neill of Swiss Banking Corporation commented that the US
administration might have been moved to act by the weakness in both US bond
and equity markets in recent days and by the surge in the gold price.
By contrast, the dollar failed to consolidate against the D-Mark in Europe,
in spite of comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president,
implying that the speed of German rate cuts might increase.
The Bundesbank president said Germany's economic situation had deteriorated,
and that this had to be taken into account in the setting of money market
rates.
After closing at DM1.5675 in London on Monday night, the dollar peaked at
the DM1.5830 level yesterday before easing back to finish at DM1.5800. In
subsequent New York trading the US currency moved higher to end at DM1.5847.
The peseta weakened sharply at the start of European trading, bottoming out
at Pta74.05 to the D-Mark. The Bank of Spain intervened again to support its
currency, bidding between Pta73.85 and Pta74.00. The peseta closed at
Pta73.68, fractionally firmer on the day.
One interbank dealer in London said the level of intervention by the Spanish
authorities in recent days had been colossal. He estimated that the Bank's
reserves were now in the area of Dollars 20bn, one third of the level at
which they stood in January.
Sterling again broke through the DM2.50 level against the D-Mark, following
strong UK business confidence figures. It slipped back, however, to close
unchanged on the day at DM2.4925.

FT  28 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Timber growers attack Forestry
Commission privatisation plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE PRIVATISATION of the Forestry Commission's woodlands
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
now under discussion by a government committee - was 'not a subject which
the forestry industry wanted on the agenda at this time', the chairman of
Timber Growers UK, which represents private woodland owners, said yesterday.
Mr Andrew Christie-Miller said that it was vital for the government and the
industry to produce together a national forestry strategy to take forestry
into the next century as a part of an overall land use strategy for the UK.
The industry had to be consulted in the review, he said. 'If not we'll have
a solution thrust on us that almost certainly won't be to our liking,' Mr
Christie-Miller said.
Last month Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, revealed that a committee of
civil servants was reviewing options for the 'ownership and management of
Forestry Commission woodlands', and was reviewing the effectiveness of
forestry investment incentives.
Mr Christie-Miller told the annual meeting of TGUK: 'We have to be
politically aware of the considerable pressures within government for
privatisation. My view is that current government philosophy suggests that
it is now more a question of when rather than if (the Forestry Commission's
woodlands are privatised).
'We are not abandoning our friends in the commission - merely trying to
steer the debate in the best interests of the whole industry,' he explained.
The forestry owners are concerned that the question of privatising the
Forestry Enterprise, the part of the Forestry Commission that owns and
manages its forests, will arouse political controversy and divert attention
from what it considers the more important issue of agreeing a new set of
objectives for forestry and incentives to revive tree planting.
They are also worried about the lack of formal consultation by the committee
which is chaired by the Scottish Office, with representatives from the
Treasury, the No 10 Downing Street policy unit, the Forestry Commission and
several other ministries.
The privatisation of Forestry Enterprise was denounced at the meeting as 'a
silly piece of dogma' by Mr Patrick Gordon-Duff-Pennington, chairman of the
official Red Deer Commission and former convener of the Scottish Landowners
Federation.
'We don't like the dogma that is being thrust down our throats. The
government is talking rubbish,' he said.
The Forestry Commission, he said, was 'bloody marvellous' under its chairman
Sir Raymond Johnstone and its director-general Mr Robin Cutler.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Precious metals prices slipped from morning levels as gold, which had led
the rally, fell from its highs on profit-taking. GOLD was fixed at Dollars
351.40 a troy ounce in the afternoon, Dollars 1.40 lower than the morning's
eight-month high fix of Dollars 352.80. But dealers said gold's upside
target was still around Dollars 360. They also said that following Sir James
Goldsmith's large purchase of gold options, the underlying market could
expect a period of increased volatility. SILVER also fell in afternoon trade
after fixing at a ten-month high of 410.25 cents. London's robusta COFFEE
futures closed higher as the market's sharp reversal of its downward trend
continued, aided by more constructive indications on both fundamentals and
charts. The drop of more than 100,000 60-kilo bags in the latest US
certified stock figures and the good absorption of May New York arabica
delivery notices helped to fuel the upward move. Short-term charts were also
seen as reasonably constructive, with technicians looking for a close above
60.50 cents a lb for New York's July contract to reinforce bullish
formations. There has been little sign of origin selling.

FT  28 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fresh suitor bids for hand of
jilted NY exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JUST A week after being jilted by the Chicago Board of Trade, New York's
Commodity Exchange (Comex) has received a proposal to become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The Nymex board of directors voted to offer a Dollars 10m consolidation plan
to Comex yesterday morning. The proposal would create two separate divisions
at NYmex, one for metals and one for energy. Nymex members would retain
exclusive rights to trade their own products but would be allowed to trade
Comex metals contracts for their private accounts.
Under the deal Comex members would gain limited trading rights to new Nymex
products. The merger plan, which is subject to exchange reviews and
ratification by both Comex and Nymex members, would make the combined
exchanges the fourth largest futures and options arena in the world, with a
unique dominance in oil and gold. Nymex had volume of 47m contracts in 1992,
while Comex had a turnover of 13m.
The CBoT withdrew its three-month-old take-over offer for the Comex in the
face of strong Comex member resistance. The CBoT had failed to offer Comex
members any cash for the exchange, and also refused to give them access to
its own successful grain and interest rate products.
While the Nymex's Dollars 10m offer is modest, and there is historical
animosity between the two New York markets, it may have a chance of success.
Comex has been forced to seek a partner because of declining volume and
revenues. In addition to cash, the Nymex board today said that the plan
would provide significant cost-savings.
The deal would allow the two exchanges to combine trade-clearing operations,
would give Comex access to the Nymex's electronic after-hours global trading
network set to be launched June 24, and would allow the two exchanges to
seek combined trading space outside their current quarters in New York's
World Trade Center.

FT  28 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Iran to buy palm oil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRAN IS to buy 100,000 tonnes of palm oil from Malaysia, according to Mr Lim
Keng Yaik, Malaysia's minister for primary industries. The order, worth
MDollars 130m (USDollars 50m), will be undertaken under Malaysia's palm oil
export credit scheme.
Under the export credit scheme, which has been in force for the past two
years, countries who buy at least 200,000 tonnes of Malaysia's palm oil in
one year are given up to two years to repay. China, India, Pakistan, Russia,
Algeria and Egypt have all been offered the facility but to date only
Pakistan and Algeria have taken it up.
Iran was offered the facility following a recent visit there by Dr Mahathir
Mohmad, Malaysia's prime minister. It is not clear whether Iran has agreed
to buy a further 100,000 tonnes of palm oil this year in order to conform to
the terms of the credit arrangements or whether Malaysia has relaxed its
rules on the scheme in an effort to encourage more exports.

AT FIRST sight it looks like a military installation. But beyond the
khaki-clad figures manning machine guns from sandbagged tents, and the two
rows of flood-lit razor-wire, lie the hopes of oil giant British Petroleum
for improving its ailing fortunes.
The Cusiana 2A production facility is one of a series of heavily guarded oil
rigs nestling incongruously in the rolling foothills of Casanare in
Colombia's eastern Andes. An area until recently inhabited only by Angus
cows and subsistence farmers, the rigs mark the discovery last year that
Casanare was sitting on an underground sea of 2bn barrels of oil. BP's
richest find since the early 1970s, the Cusiana-Cupiagua field adds 5 per
cent to the company's world-wide reserves and is the basis for Colombia's
aims of doubling its oil production.
Oil companies are used to operating in difficult conditions but, as the
elaborate security measures at Cusiana 2A illustrate, BP Colombia faces an
unusual problem. Cusiana is on the front line of the Colombian government's
long-running battle against guerrillas - a prime target of the nominally
Marxist groups who explode pipelines in an attempt to force out
multinationals from the country's vast, violence-ridden backlands.
Although Cusiana is on land only 60 km (100 miles) east of the capital, its
rigs are run like offshore facilities with workers staying on site for 28
days and then helicoptered off. Mr Phil Mead, operations manager, says,
'it's very frustrating for our people working out there that they can't just
drop round to the local hacienda or go out to a bar'.
However the government and oil companies have a shared interest in
combatting terrorism. Not only is President Cesar Gavriria anxious to end
the violence that so mars the country's reputation, but oil represents 22
per cent of Colombia's export earnings and half of last year's foreign
investment, making the industry a vital key to future prosperity.
'There is a real synergy - the government and foreign companies have the
same goal,' says a presidential adviser. He points out that the oil is in
areas where the government is weak and the population poor and thus
susceptible to guerrillas. In Casanare, for example, half the population is
below the poverty line. 'Not only could oil money help development of these
areas,' the adviser explains, 'but the oil companies can help the government
reduce terrorism by providing an alternative source of income.'
As its own investment in the oil industry, the government has installed an
army battalion at Yopal, the capital of Casanare, to protect BP and its
partners Total and Triton, and is offering sizeable bounty for information
leading to the capture of guerrillas. It is now illegal for companies to pay
protection money, on pain of expulsion, reinforced at frequent meetings
between military high command and business leaders.
The new measures are already showing results. So far this year there have
been seven pipeline explosions - a big drop from last year's 86, which cost
state oil company Ecopetrol Dollars 100m in lost sales.
To operate without paying off guerrillas, companies must win over local
communities using what Mr Harding calls a 'hearts and minds strategy'. He
explains that 'we are working with the peasants and farmers to help them
understand that the benefits for them lie with helping the oil companies and
not the other side'. To do this BP has public relations officers based at
rigs to go out explaining what they are doing. The company supports
community projects in 55 villages and gave jobs last year to 2,500 local
people.
Winning over local inhabitants is also crucial for acquiring seismic data.
Mr Tony Hayward, exploration manager, points out that 'it is much harder to
protect 2,000 people scattered over a large area than fixed installations'.
Last December BP began an innovative system, establishing a series of local
co-operatives from which the seismic company contracts labour for removing
vegetation, cutting and drilling lines and placing dynamite, the latter kept
under army guard. 'This has been very successful in letting us do our work
while bringing money into local communities,' Mr Hayward says. 'We now have
no security problems because the locals have a vested interest in seeing
this work carried out.'
Security is not BP's only headache. According to Mr Hayward the light crude
produced is of 'top quality - Latin America's only low sulphur metal free
oil'. But it lies at depths of 14,000 to 16000 feet and drilling conditions
are very difficult because of the mountainous terrain. Tectonic presures
cause hole instability making it slow work and the casing frequently
collapses or the pipe sticks.
Cusiana 2a took 18 months to reach its target. However, for new wells the
time has been considerably reduced; the completion target for the latest
well Los Cedros is 66 days at a cost of Dollars 8m, compared with last
year's average of Dollars 20m.
Of the six wells completed so far on Cusiana and Cupiagua only Buenos Aires
1 is currently in production - producing 10,200 barrels a day since last
September. The field will be declared commercial next month, triggering off
a Dollars 1.1bn investment programme to boost production to 150,000 b/d by
1995 - the maximum under current pipeline limitations. As a 19 per cent
equity holder BP's share will be about Dollars 200m, on top of the Dollars
250m it has invested since arriving in 1986.
According to Mr Nick Connolly, BP's Commercial manager for Latin America,
under phase II of the project production will rise to between 600,000 and
800,000 b/d by 1998. For this a new pipeline must be built - no easy task as
it must cross two mountain ranges to reach the port of Covenas. Estimated
total investment over the next four to five years is Dollars 4.8bn.
The Cusiana production will make Colombia the second largest oil exporter in
Latin America and provide an estimated annual revenue of Dollars 4bn-5bn,
pushing the country's annual growth rate from last year's 3.6 per cent to
more than 5 per cent. This is causing some worry among directors of
Colombia's Central Bank who fear having to revalue the peso.
In fact production may be higher. While refusing to give specific figures,
BP officials believe that the estimate of 500,000 b/d for Cupiagua where
only two wells have been spudded so far is low. Mr Hayward says, 'this is
one of the hottest patches in the whole oil industry. There is a definite
upside but we don't yet know how much'. He believes the trend continues to
the north into the Piedemonte area, which BP owns 100 per cent. The company
plans to drill two wells there this year.
Operating in Colombia may present unusual challenges but for BP security
measures are just part of the production cost. The company employs more than
600 security officers, and Mr David Harding, chief executive for Latin
America, has to travel in a bullet-proof car with guards and motorcycle
outriders.
'We believe its worth it,' he says. 'We're here for the long term.'

FT  28 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers prepares to boost
diamond supplies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DE BEERS, the South African group that controls about 80 per cent of the
world diamond market, yesterday responded to an improvement in the world
diamond market by increasing the amount it will buy from producers.
Last autumn the group, which organises the market through the London-based
Central Selling Organisation, told producers to cut agreed deliveries by 25
per cent as it struggled to bring supply and demand back into balance. Last
year its sales fell by 13 per cent from 1991 levels to Dollars 3.147bn - a
five-year low.
In February this year, however, De Beers was able to increase its prices by
an average of 1.5 per cent - the first rise for nearly three years.
Yesterday the group said that 'in line with the changing relationship
between anticipated CSO sales for 1993 and potential supply, the 75 per cent
quota entitlement will be increased to 80 per cent with effect from May 1'.
Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, the group's chairman, said that while the
increase was not large, it showed the market was better than when the quota
was imposed last August. He said the first three 'sights', as its sales are
known, were 'very good'. The next is due next week.
The improved market is put down to reduced smuggling from Angola because of
the rainy season and the resumption of the civil war; slow sales from
Russia, particularly before it lifted the 20 per cent export duty; and
buoyant demand from India, which had increased sales to the US. Retail
signals were mixed, said Mr Ogilvie Thompson, but it was encouraging that
diamond jewellery sales had held up despite the recession.

Employment in Stevenage is moving to the services sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE STEADMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STEVENAGE, the first of the new towns, has seen its employment base undergo
a significant change since the beginning of the 1980s, writes Anne Steadman.
Traditionally a manufacturing town, the emphasis has shifted in recent years
towards the services sector.
But, although the proportion of manufacturing to services jobs has moved
from 55/45 per cent to 35/65 per cent during the period, the total number of
jobs, at around 35,000, has remained fairly constant.
In common with other Hertfordshire towns, Stevenage has had to bear its
share of the burden of the decline in the defence industry. Two divisions of
British Aerospace, Space Systems and Dynamics, are located within its
Gunnels Wood industrial area, but the town has also had considerable success
in attracting inward investment in the past few years.
One recent success is the new Pounds 40m head office of Provident Mutual,
which will be officially opened on May 26. The complex of three interlinked
buildings provides a total of 200,000 sq ft of offices, of which all except
30,000 sq ft will be occupied by Provident Mutual's 850 staff.
The company began moving personnel out of its original base in Moorgate, in
the City of London, in the mid-1950s, first to Hitchin. Pressure on space
led to expansion into Stevenage, where eventually more offices were taken.
The decision to stay in the Stevenage area was based on several
considerations. Transport links, says Ian Cartwright, Provident Mutual's
administration services manager, are excellent, particularly the high-speed
125 rail service into Kings Cross In addition, the company has forged firm
links with local schools, which offer good recruitment potential.
There is also a good range of housing - both in Stevenage itself, where
prices are as cheap as anywhere in Hertfordshire, and in the surrounding
villages - a factor which influences recruitment from outside the area.
Added to this, Provident Mutual had developed a good relationship with the
council.
An even bigger boost for Stevenage has been Glaxo's decision to locate its
European research campus in Stevenage, on a 75-acre site in Gunnels Wood.
There is also a site of 25-acres for further expansion, should it be needed.
Glaxo was looking for a large site with good access to road, rail and air
communications, says Richard Sykes, chairman and chief executive of Glaxo
Group Research.
Stevenage also had the UK's first purpose-designed pedestrianised town
centre. An indoor shopping mall, Norwich Union's, Westgate Centre, has been
added, bringing town-centre retail space up to 1m sq ft. Most of the major
high street multiples are represented, but the original part of the town
centre has begun to look rather tired.
As part of its on-going plans to promote and sell Stevenage, the council
plans improvements to the town centre and to the walkways which form the
access route from the station.
Recladding of the leisure centre, along with improvement to the footbridges,
is also a priority. The council is committed to putting up some of the cash
for the improvements, but is also looking for input from the private sector.
Response from retailers and landowners with vested interests has been
positive so far, says Elizabeth Wilson, Stevenage's head of development and
planning. The council is also considering some form of town centre
management, again in partnership with the private sector.

FT  28 APR 93 / Survey of Hertfordshire (5): Sites identified for overseas
arrivals - Property / Office rents have dived by as much as 40 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE STEADMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATE 1980s property boom, which outside London centred on the M4
corridor, rippled north-east into Hertfordshire. Jeremy Needs, a director of
Hitchin-based developer Hunting Gate, aptly sums up what happened in the
property market: 'Hertfordshire caught the Heathrow disease.'
The result is that the Hertfordshire Development Organisation (HDO), the
body set up under the county's Partnership for Prosperity programme last
September, estimates that there is now some 15m square metres of vacant
office and other commercial space within the area. Office rents throughout
the county have plunged by as much as 40 per cent, according to surveyors,
Weatherall Green &amp; Smith.
Landlords are not only having to slash rents (if, indeed, official quoting
rents still apply in this market), but also to offer incentive packages.
These include rent-free periods, contributions towards fitting out and even,
in some cases, taking on a tenant's existing lease commitments.
By general consensus, the best rent in Hertfordshire was achieved in the
1988-9 relocation to Watford of Rhone-Poulenc, which took 53,000 square feet
in Kumagai Gumi/Ranelagh's Central Park at marginally over Pounds 30 a sq
ft. In contrast, today Legal &amp; General Property and Hunting Gate are seeking
Pounds 22 a sq ft for their high specification 78,000 sq ft Edward Hyde
office development in Clarendon Road, Watford. It has been completed and
empty for 18 months.
The HDO, however, is drawing up a marketing plan that will spread the net
much wider, targeting inward investment from overseas companies.
It is likely that incoming companies will require business park-type
accommodation; and, to ensure that there will be a good choice of locations,
the HDO has identified five strategic sites in the county, all currently at
different stages of development.
Most advanced is Markheath's Kings Park, a 22-acre site adjoining the
railway station at Stevenage. With space for 600,000 sq ft of business
space, the site is already landscaped, with infrastructure in place - and
the developer is willing to begin immediate construction for an occupier.
The other sites are at Cherry Tree Lane, Hemel Hempstead; the Rolls Royce
site at Leavesden, near Watford; Essex Road, Hoddesden; and the British
Aerospace site at Hatfield.
The 57-acre Cherry Tree Lane site, at Junction 8 on the M1, is owned partly
by the Commission for the New Towns and partly by the Crown Estate. Mainly
green-field, it has been earmarked by the planners for business and
industrial development. However, its availability will depend on the
provision of a new access road.
Construction of a bridge over a railway is needed, to facilitate development
at Essex Road, Hoddesden. This 30-acre site, designated for general
industrial and warehousing, is owned by Powergen, Redland and the Department
of Transport. Rolls-Royce is to vacate the 60-acre Leavesden site at the end
of June, and development will be for mixed use: offices and R&amp;D.
These first four sites are, however, dwarfed by the British Aerospace site
at Hatfield, where there is potential for some 200 acres of development.
British Aerospace property subsidiary Arlington is busy at the 92-acre
former BAe Dynamics site, which has planning consent for 960,000 sq ft of
mixed uses - offices, light industrial, general industrial and warehousing.
Already a 78,000 sq ft depot for Royal Mail's Streamline Parcels has been
completed on a design-and-build basis. In addition, BAe's purpose-built
conference centre - which was never used - has been sold to the University
of Hertfordshire. Work is under way on the simultaneous demolition of
buildings and provision of new infrastructure, both scheduled for completion
in November.
A further 100 acres will become available with the closure of BAe's Comet
Way jets area. Giles Thomas, of agents Strutt &amp; Parker, says Arlington is
looking at the planning implications, and also at short-term alternative
uses. He says there are signs of further interest from potential occupiers,
with three serious proposals before prospective tenants.
Although the Hatfield Business Park seems set to become Hertfordshire's
largest, Hunting Gate and Allied Dunbar's 55-acre Shire park at Welwyn
Garden City must rank as one of the most successful so far. A total of
400,000 sq ft is now built and occupied by companies, including ICI,
Digital, Nexus and Aircall. In addition, Warren Spring laboratory, the
government's principal environmental technology laboratory, has taken a
10-acre site. Its new facility is due for completion in spring 1995. A
further 125,000 sq ft in four buildings is available in a second phase at
Shire Park; and joint agents, Gooch &amp; Wagstaff and Jones Lang Wootton, are
indicating rents of around Pounds 23 a sq ft.
Little industrial property development is currently being undertaken in
Hertfordshire, although the level of industrial oversupply is far lower than
that of offices. One of the largest current industrial/warehouse
developments is Burton Property Trust and IBM Pension Fund's City Park, at
Welwyn Garden City, where only three units remain.
More recent occupiers at the 230,000 sq ft project include Haking
International (UK), the world's largest manufacturer of cameras and
binoculars, which bought a 22,000 sq ft unit for Pounds 2.1m, and Parcel
Force which took a lease on a 27,000 sq ft unit.
The Hatfield Galleria, put up by Carroll Group subsidiary A1 Galleria
Investment Corporation, was one of the most spectacular retail casualties in
the recession. Now in receivership, the future of the 400,000 sq ft shopping
centre is unclear, though it continues to trade.
Besides the dramatic construction cost over-run, another of Galleria's
problems was a restrictive user clause, effectively preventing the centre
from competing with the fashion draw of Slough Estates' much more successful
216,000 sq ft Howard Centre, at Welwyn Garden City. The two centres fall
within the same borough, and Slough successfully sued the local authority
for failing to enforce the user clause at the Galleria.
The only other major shopping centre to open in Hertfordshire during the
past two years - again in the south of the county - was Capital &amp;
Counties/Sun Alliance/Watford Borough Council's Harlequin Centre, Watford.
At 700,000 sq ft, it is one of the biggest in the UK. The last of the three
phases of the Pounds 100m project was completed last summer, and this
200,000 sq ft section has attracted a flurry of lettings to fashion
retailers, including River Island, Hennes, Stirling Cooper and Miss
Selfridge.
The almost-completed M1 link road, which gives the centre direct access to
the motorway network, will upgrade its status, the developers hope, to that
of a regional shopping centre.

FT  28 APR 93 / Survey of Hertfordshire (7): A new leaf for the textbook
town - Letchworth, the original garden city, is leaving the public sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE STEADMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LETCHWORTH, the world's first garden city, still features strongly in
textbooks in numerous languages.
And last year alone, the Garden City Corporation - the public body formed by
Act of Parliament in 1962, to replace the original First Garden City Ltd,
set up in 1903 to buy nearly 4,000 acres - played host to no fewer than 500
visitors from 22 countries.
Once again, however, the corporation's future is before parliament. A
private bill, to allow the corporation to become a heritage foundation (an
industrial and provident society with charitable status) had its first and
second readings in the Commons in January, and will begin its committee
stage next month. Royal Assent is expected early next year.
The corporation was asked by the secretary of state for the environment to
come up with plans to leave the public sector. The heritage foundation
option was chosen because it will maintain the corporation's tax-exempt
position, enabling it to continue to plough back revenue from its estate
into the town in the form of grants and community facilities. It will also
allow flexibility in the management of the estate, and protect it against
commercial takeover.
Local opinion appears broadly in favour although there have been nine
petitions against the bill - one from the Letchworth Leaseholders and
Freeholders Association, and others from individuals, most of whom are
connected with the same organisation.
From the very early days, Letchworth, which now has a population of around
33,000, grew and flourished, enjoying full employment. Then came the early
1980s recession. Unemployment quickly reached 13 per cent as the four major
engineering and manufacturing firms that had formed the focus of the town's
employment - ICL, Shelvoke &amp; Drewery, Borg Warner Automatic Transmissions
and Kryn &amp; Lahy - scaled down their operations, or left.
Faced with this unforeseen crisis, the Garden City Corporation was forced to
review its policy. The resulting strategy remains in place today: the town
could no longer rely on a handful of large employers. A good spread of
smaller and medium-sized businesses would provide a more stable employment
base. In addition, a more hands-on management role was called for, helping
new businesses to set up; nurturing and looking after existing ones and
responding to their needs.
As a first step, a corporation-funded business centre was established in
1981 to give free advice and other assistance to those wishing to start new
businesses, and a variety of small units to rent were provided on the
estate. Then, as the strategy began to bear fruit - and corporation chief
executive Andrew Egerton-Smith points out that, until the current recession,
Letchworth prided itself on a business start-up rate way above the national
average - it was decided that larger units were needed.
In the mid-1980s, a site was acquired with PosTel, and development began of
what is now the Letchworth Business Park. Occupiers now include Du Pont
Pharmaceutical, John Tann, Barron McCann, Unichem, Tesco Computer Centre and
Sainsbury's. The park also accommodates a new business centre, with free
advice on offer.
The Letchworth Business Club was formed in 1986, and now has 400 members. It
is widely-regarded as one of the most successful of its type. Meetings are
addressed by high-profile speakers, but the club also provides a forum for
business discussion and encourages trading between members. It has links
with training, cultural and educational organisations, and is expanding its
contact area to assist other business clubs in the south.
Typical of Letchworth's flexible approach and determination to grow its own
employment base is Fermark, a supplier of brassieres to Marks &amp; Spencer. The
company moved to Letchworth in the late 1960s from London's east end.
Fourteen years ago it had just 60 staff; today it has 450, including 100 new
recruits in the past few months.
Fermark's production director, Peter Girdler, says that, over the years, the
corporation has made several additions and alterations to the factory and,
more recently, added an attractive facade. Now, with the company once again
outgrowing its 28,000 sq ft premises, the corporation is refurbishing a
nearby factory unit, which will house its packing and warehousing
operations, leaving production at its existing site.
A more recent Letchworth recruit is Altro, which manufactures industrial
safety flooring. Its products are in use at, among other sites, 10 Downing
Street, Wembley Stadium, the White House, Melbourne Cricket Club and the
QE2.
The company moved on to the garden estate in 1988, acquiring a 120,000 sq ft
building which has been upgraded and refaced. It subsequently moved its car
valeting subsidiary Autoglym to an adjoining building, and recently took the
opportunity of adding the building on the other side for future expansion.
Altro has expanded during the recession, turning in record results - pre-tax
profits of Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 2.1m) on turnover of Pounds 36.6m (Pounds
32.4m) for the year to September 1992.
Chief Executive Michael Fincham says that, when the company moved from
Hertford, it looked as far afield as Leeds and Bradford in its search for a
new base. Plus-factors for Letchworth, besides the pleasant living
conditions, included its excellent communications - close to the A1 and M1,
airports and the rail services - and the businesslike attitude of the
Corporation.

FT  28 APR 93 / Survey of Hertfordshire (3): Increased emphasis on R&amp;D -
Pharmaceuticals / The sector has deep roots in the county
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
EUROPE'S leading centre for pharmaceuticals research and development is not
Basle, home of the Swiss giants, Ciba, Roche and Sandoz. It is
Hertfordshire.
Four of the world's biggest drugs groups, Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham of
the UK, Roche of Switzerland and Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme of the US, employ
between them about 5,500 workers in the region.
Hertfordshire's importance as a centre for drugs manufacturing has declined
in recent years as land prices have increased, but its importance as a
centre for research and development has increased.
By 1995, there will be about 3,500 R&amp;D pharmaceuticals scientists in the
county, according to a recent report* by the South East Economic Development
Strategy. In 1990, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry
estimated there were 16,300 R&amp;D drugs employees in the UK.
Increasing government pressures on the industry's prices and profits are
likely to lead to rationalisation first and foremost in manufacturing and
then marketing. But only the weakest companies - among which Glaxo, Merck,
SmithKline Beecham and Roche do not figure - will be forced to cut R&amp;D.
Glaxo has been the European leader in rationalising manufacturing
facilities, but decided to concentrate some of its secondary manufacturing
at Ware, suggesting this site is safe as a production location.
Glaxo, Europe's largest pharmaceuticals group and the largest drugs employer
in the region, has made the most important R&amp;D investment in Hertfordshire
in recent years. The group, the world's biggest R&amp;D spender, is building a
Pounds 500m research campus, designed to house 1,500 staff. By 1995, the
company expects to employ 1,000 people in manufacturing at Ware, and a
further 1,200 for drug development at the same site, on top of the 1,500 at
Stevenage.
The 75-acre Stevenage site, comprising 10 main buildings, will be the
Glaxo's largest research centre in the world. The campus will be used to
seek treatments for cancer, heart attacks, arthritis, Aids, and diseases
associated with ageing.
Meanwhile, SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American group, remains the second
largest pharmaceuticals employer in the region with about 1,700 employees.
Its UK pharmaceuticals headquarters is at Mundells, in Welwyn Garden City, a
legacy of SmithKline &amp; French's move to the area in 1959.
The company no longer manufactures in the area, having closed its facilities
last year following the merger of the US group SmithKline Beckman with
Beecham of the UK in 1989. SmithKline Beecham says it wanted to concentrate
its manufacturing operations at two sites, Crawley and Worthing. However, it
still distributes products from warehouses in the Hertfordshire region.
SmithKline Beecham's remaining facilities include the R&amp;D centre at the
Frythe site, in the village of Old, where about 500 people are employed.
Merck Sharpe &amp; Dohme, the world's largest pharmaceuticals group, has its UK
headquarters at Hoddesdon, where about 950 people are employed.
Du Pont Merck, Merck's joint venture with Du Pont of the US, has its
European headquarters in Watford. A number of smaller groups also have
branches in the region. They include Astra Pharmaceutical, a subsidiary of
the Swedish group, which has its UK sales and marketing base at Kings
Langley, and Serono Laboratories, part of the Geneva-based Ares-Serono,
which has its marketing wing at Welwyn. Schering-Plough, the US group, plans
to move its UK headquarters from Mildenhall, in Suffolk, to Welwyn Garden
City later this year.
Not all of the traffic has been one way, however. In 1981, Smith &amp; Nephew
decided to move some of its operations to Romford in Essex, where it was
already manufacturing. It is also moving operations from Gilston,
Hertfordshire, to York.
The reason for the concentration of pharmaceuticals activity in
Hertfordshire is a combination of historical accident and the county's
natural advantages. Many are located there because they acquired businesses
in the region. SmithKline Beecham's presence can be attributed to its
takeover of AJ White in 1956, for example.
Roche has had operations in Welwyn Garden City since 1937. One of its four
international research centres is based there. Dr Jurgen Drews, head of
Roche's international R&amp;D, says the Welwyn site is in charge of Roche's
research into herpes and HIV, the virus that causes Aids, as well as some
inflammatory work.
The site also contains the UK head office, general administration, and sales
and marketing. Some 300 people are involved in manufacturing. Roche
Nicholas, the over-the-counter non-prescription drugs business, is also
based there, as well as the recently acquired businesses from Fisons.
The company was attracted by the availability of land, easy communications
with London, and plentiful and skilled labour, according to Mr John Bennie,
head of personnel and administration for pharmaceuticals at Roche Products,
the Swiss group's UK subsidiary.
'Those reasons still hold true today, apart from the availability of land,'
says Mr Bennie. Communications are still good, with travelling times of 45
minutes to Heathrow airport if the M25 motorway is clear. Stansted, although
geographically closer, takes about the same time to reach.
Labour shortages, acute five years ago, have become much less of a problem
because of the recession. Attracting skilled scientists has become less
tricky since house prices have fallen.
Nevertheless, the recent South East Economic Development Strategy study
suggested that there were still difficulties in recruiting people with
appropriate skills, training and experience, although it added companies
were insisting there was no crisis.
Glaxo said the shortages were caused by a declining number of young people,
as well as fewer being interested in science. Many local schools had also
tended to teach engineering-orientated subjects for the aerospace sector,
the dominant local industry.
One final attraction for many former north London employees, says Mr Bennie,
is the proximity of Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal football clubs, although
he admits this was not a reason why Roche concentrated its activities in the
area.
The South East Economic Development Strategy report also cites the proximity
of the county to the UK department of health and leading teaching hospitals
in the south east, as well as easy access to the universities of Oxford and
Cambridge.
Given the strength of the pharmaceutials industry and its roots in
Hertfordshire, the sector should prove an important counter-weight to the
decline of the aerospace sector in the future.

FT  28 APR 93 / Survey of Hertfordshire (4): Ideas pooled to win jobs -
Networks / The new awakening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RHYS DAVID
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LACK of a strong identity or image has always been one of
Hertfordshire's weaknesses. Its geography has pulled it in several
directions - towards the East Midlands or East Anglia in the north, or
towards London and the other home counties in the south.
Though among the largest English counties in population, with nearly 1m
inhabitants, it lacks a single main town; and, because of their differing
histories and industrial backgrounds, its half a dozen sizeable centres vary
widely in character.
Stevenage in the north has long been an important industrial centre in its
own right, with little to link it to Watford, which falls almost within the
orbit of Heathrow in the west. Hoddesdon in the east has benefited as a
distribution centre from its position on the route from the east coast
ports; Potters Bar is a refugee from pre-1965 Middlesex and still looks for
jobs and services to north London.
Yet the coherence that has previously been difficult to achieve has recently
shown signs of emerging. Where business and local government once went their
separate ways, a series of networks has come into place across the county,
leading the private and public sectors to pool resources and ideas for
overcoming the problems caused by the loss of jobs in the defence and
aerospace sectors.
The twin centres of the new structure are the Tec, operating from a
converted mill just outside St. Albans, and the county council which has
thrown off a previous diffidence and involved itself in the fortunes of
businesses big and small.
The new University of Hertfordshire, having emerged from the chrysalis of
Hatfield Polytechnic, has also involved itself in local economic
initiatives, in order to establish its county-wide credentials; another main
element, playing an important co-ordinating role, is the Hertfordshire
Chamber of Commerce, which has most of the county's important industrial and
service companies in membership.
Since the mid-1980s there has also been a substantial growth in financial
services, with firms such as KPMG Peat Marwick, Price Waterhouse and Hambros
moving in, mainly to St. Albans, to provide sophisticated services
previously available only in London. As they build up contacts across the
county, these firms have themselves become nodal points on the Hertfordshire
network.
The first tangible result of this new spirit of co-operation has been the
Hertfordshire Development Organisation (HDO), a partnership between local
companies, the county and district local authorities, and the Tec. The last
will itself seek to act as a bridge, linking companies which might want to
come to the county with the relevant planning bodies and with developers.
Particular emphasis is being placed on winning firms in areas where the
county is already strong, such as computers, office equipment,
telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, and financial and business services.
Establishment of the HDO, which operates from another converted building - a
barn between Hitchin and Stevenage - was one of the recommendations to
emerge from a study of the county undertaken by accountants Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, and a subsequent conference that brought together parties
interested in economic regeneration.
In much the same way, the Hertfordshire Business Centre, for which
government One Stop Shop for Business status has just been won, is the
outcome of a consultation exercise involving all 26,000 businesses in the
county. To be set up shortly on a site in the centre of the county with the
support of EC funds, it will serve the needs of all businesses but
especially those employing between 10 and 200 people, and start-ups.
It is planned that other economic agencies in the county will move to the
site, which will also have out-stations in other centres linked over the
county's Comnet voice and data transmission system.
Independently, the county council has been trying to ensure, under chief
executive Brian Briscoe, that it responds more effectively to the needs of
businesses - and also makes known to them the opportunities they have to
supply the Pounds 250m of goods and services the local authority consumes
each year.
A Business Forum, set up jointly with the Tec, enables larger businesses,
local chambers, enterprise agencies and others to make their views known, at
regular meetings, and to influence the way support is provided.
Another initiative, the business charter, is designed to strip away the
bureaucracy which many businesses find in their dealings with local
authorities, which can very often obscure the services and information on
offer. The most common concerns of businesses have been grouped under a
series of headings - regulation, education, purchasing, roads and transport
 -and hotlines set up to deal with inquiries in these fields. As a result,
businesses will be able to find out quickly how county policies and
Government and EC regulation are likely to affect them, and how they can
have input into decisions.
Just how effective the development of this new, closer relationship between
all parties involved in Hertfordshire's economic life proves, remains to be
seen, though the efforts of both the county and the Tec have drawn praise
from business leaders. The change, according to Gerry Hopkinson, until
recently senior partner at KPMG Peat Marwick in St Albans, has been marked:
'The county has changed from lack of interest in business to being very keen
to talk. Together with the Tec, it has persuaded businesses in the county to
network very effectively,' he says.
Other structural problems remain. They include a disturbing lack of interest
among local companies in exporting, according to Chris Humphries, managing
director of the Tec; and continuing difficulty in obtaining long-term bank
finance for small and medium-sized companies, particularly the
owner-managed, which is forcing companies to operate on a short term basis.
'The banks are not lending for risk. If small companies are to lead us out
of the recession, lending has to begin again,' argues Howard Wilkinson,
senior partner at accountants, Mercer &amp; Hole.
Paradoxically, by the time the results are showing through, the county as an
administrative authority might not exist, for its demise is scheduled under
current government plans for 1998.
It may just be, however, that by then its unifying influence is not missed,
a different Hertfordshire identity having been forged out of the
recessionary problems of the past few years.

the old A1 - used to be the pride of Hatfield. They now have a sheepish
look, eclipsed by the stark modernity of the Galleria shopping complex
across the road.
Recession caught up with both last year. The Galleria went into receivership
a year after opening, and British Aerospace announced it would stop making
aircraft there after almost 60 years, with the loss of 2,000 jobs.
Manufacturing will cease at BAe's Hatfield site by the end of this year. At
the Rolls-Royce engine plant at Leavesden, near Watford, it is due to end in
June. The two plants were among Hertfordshire's biggest employers,
figureheads of an aerospace and defence sector that has been at the core of
industrial development in the county since before the second world war.
The decline can be traced back to the mid-1980s. A report two years ago by
Mr David Kraithman, now principal economics lecturer at the University of
Hertfordshire, cited figures showing aerospace industry employment of just
under 15,000 in the county. That figure was already down by a quarter from a
peak of over 20,000 in 1985-86. Job cuts announced by large companies since
then amount to a further cut of about a third.
A broader estimate from Hertfordshire County Council put the number of jobs
in defence and aerospace five years ago at 30,000 or more. Cutbacks at
groups such as BAe, GEC and Rolls-Royce have wiped out almost half that
number of posts in the intervening period.
Hertfordshire still has a broad range of defence-related industries,
including less well-known but successful companies such as Irvin Great
Britain, a parachute maker belonging to the Hunting Group at Letchworth.
This concentration is something of a historical accident. Hertfordshire has
less to do with the military than most other counties. It has no major
defence installations other than US communications relay stations at
Bovingdon and Barkway, near Royston. An airfield at Nuthampstead, in the
north-east of the county, was used by American Flying Fortresses in the war,
but there are no bases today.
The industry grew around de Havilland, which moved its aircraft and
propeller manufacturing from Edgware to Hatfield in 1934. An engine factory,
set up on the far side of the airfield, developed into a guided weapons
centre in the 1950s.
In 1959 the de Havilland name disappeared when it was bought up by Hawker
Siddeley, and in 1978 was nationalised as part of BAe.
The plant was the original manufacturing site for the BAe 146 regional jet,
but its involvement was reduced well before the closure decision. With the
setting-up of Avro International, a joint regional jet venture between BAe
and Taiwan Aerospace Corporation, Hatfield's remaining production work is
being transferred to Woodford in Cheshire. No more than 200-300 jobs are
expected to remain, in design of corporate jets and in London Business
Aviation, which operates the airfield.
The guided weapons side, BAe Dynamics, which employed 2,200 at Hatfield,
closed down in 1989. That site, now in the hands of BAe's property
subsidiary Arlington Securities, is being developed as a business park.
Its activities - weapons - were moved to Stevenage, but jobs there have also
been sharply cut back. The guided weapons factory at Stevenage, originally
an English Electric plant set up in 1955, employed about 6,000 after the
closure of Hatfield. But with the loss of assembly and manufacturing
activities the number has since shrunk to 3,100.
Across the road from it, BAe's space facility - another legacy from de
Havilland and the UK's only builder of commercial satellites - last year
axed just over half its workforce of 1,200.
Rolls-Royce's helicopter engine factory at Leavesden is due to shut down
completely in June. Also going back to de Havilland days, it has been on the
closure list since 1991, when it still employed 1,750 people. Its work,
which has suffered a sharp fall in recent years, is being transferred to
Bristol.
GEC-Marconi announced two years ago it was closing its research and
development facility for underwater systems at Croxley Green, affecting 300
jobs. But other branches of GEC-Marconi employ about 900 at Borehamwood in a
variety of activities, mostly in defence.
Marconi Instruments, a separate subsidiary of the GEC group involved in
electronic test and measurement equipment, has its headquarters at St Albans
and a site at Stevenage, together employing about 800. Mr Peter Smith,
managing director, says a move away from manufacturing over the past four
years, with the loss of about 30 per cent of the workforce, has led to
increased emphasis on its Stevenage R&amp;D operations. Activity is mostly
geared to civilian markets, although the company's products also have
military applications.
Lucas Aerospace's power systems division at Hemel Hempstead has also cut
back over the past couple of years to its present workforce of 690. The
factory, which moved from Willesden in the later 1960s, makes electrical
generating systems and small gas turbines for aircraft such as the Tornado
and Harrier.
A survivor from successive takeovers and reorganisations is Hawker Siddeley
Dynamics Engineering, based at Welwyn Garden City. Making control systems
for gas turbine engines and gyroscopes and other systems for ships, it
escaped the nationalisation of Hawker Siddeley's aircraft and missile
businesses. Last December, a year after the takeover of Hawker Siddeley by
BTR, it declared its independence through a management buy-out. It is now
looking to non-military outlets to increase its Pounds 20m annual turnover.
The company is halving its total workforce of 520. But Mr Ian Johnston,
managing director, says its Hertfordshire operations will suffer the least
from these cuts, with about 150 jobs likely be kept at Welwyn and 60 at
Watford.
'We have retrenched into Hertfordshire to a large extent,' he says.
The company's plans confirm a trend away from manufacturing and towards
research, development and software. This is clearly the case at BAe's
remaining activities and at GEC. One result of this change is that fewer
employees in aerospace and defence-related industries live near the plants.
Stevenage-based BAe Dynamics says its catchment area is now spread
throughout Hertfordshire and further afield.
The sector was always closely identified with the development of
Hertfordshire's new towns after the war - Stevenage, Hemel Hempstead,
Hatfield and Welwyn. But this relationship is now being doubly diluted:
there are far fewer employed in the sector, and a smaller proportion have
their homes in the new towns.

WHEN BRITAIN held the presidency of the European Community during the second
half of last year, three of the key ministerial meetings were held not in
London but 25 miles north in the unfamiliar surroundings of Brocket Hall,
near Welwyn.
The choice of Hertfordshire, and of this historic house, where two Victorian
prime ministers, Lords Melbourne and Palmerston, lived and died, was
appropriate for more than just the splendour of its conference facilities
and parklands, and its high security.
Hertfordshire, with its quaint villages favoured by film-makers, its
relatively small-scale and successful urban centres, none in excess of
100,000 population, its high-technology employers, and its position close to
three of London's four main airports, and astride the motorway network, is a
part of Britain which can stand comparison with the more prosperous parts of
Europe.
Its inhabitants enjoy the second highest per capita income in the UK, and
its better-off residents have the opportunity to live in the most expensive
property outside London. Those living there include not just City types,
such as the current Lord Mayor of London, Sir Francis McWilliams, able to
take advantage of good rail links which whisk them into London in 20-30
minutes, but arts and media personalities, including the now reclusive
Clockwork Orange director, Stanley Kubrick, who lives in a heavily guarded
mansion near Harpenden.
Yet, for all its apparent prosperity, not long before Mr Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary, and Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, had begun
their talks in the county with their fellow EC ministers, local leaders had
themselves been visiting Brussels to ask the industry commissioner, Mr
Martin Bangemann, and other officials for aid.
Hertfordshire has had to follow the route taken by other councils from more
economically depressed regions of Britain, because of the impact on several
of its key towns of the decision by British Aerospace to close down its
Hatfield site, home in the past to aircraft as famous as: the Mosquito, the
World War II fighter-bomber; the Comet, the first commercial jetliner;
Trident; the BAe125; and, in more recent years, the BAe146 regional
jetliner.
A total of 2,300 employees will lose their jobs by the end of this year,
following others who have been made redundant in earlier cutbacks at the
plant, which, during the mid-1980s, employed 7,500. British Aerospace has
also been scaling down other operations within the county in its missile and
satellite plants, mainly in Stevenage. The same pressure within the aviation
market has forced Rolls-Royce to close its helicopter engine plant at
Leavesden, near Watford, in June this year, again with the loss of 2,000
jobs.
Even before these job losses were announced, unemployment in Hertfordshire,
which had been as low as 2.1 per cent in November 1989, had risen by late
last year to near the national average of more than 10 per cent, giving the
county the dubious distinction of the fastest-rising unemployment rate in
the UK. For a county which has always weathered UK downturns, it represents,
in the words of Professor Neil Buxton, Vice Chancellor of the University of
Hertfordshire (formerly Hatfield Polytechnic) quite a somersault.
Nor has it just been the skilled and unskilled engineering workers who have
borne the brunt of these job losses, taking the county unemployment total
well above 40,000. The shake-out in the City of London, where banks,
insurance companies and other financial institutions have shed thousands of
jobs, has hit the county badly. In St. Albans, one in four of the unemployed
is from a professional job.
The response, however, to the county's problems has been swift and well
co-ordinated. With British Aerospace's difficulties already clear some time
ago, the county council and the local Training and Enterprise council (Tec)
commissioned a study, from accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, of the economy's
strengths and weaknesses. From this has emerged a new strategy and a body
dedicated to promoting inward investment: the Hertfordshire Development
Organisation (HDO).
The county's trip to Brussels brought in funds worth Pounds 0.7m from the
EC's Perifra programme for helping regions destabilised by large-scale
closures - money which will be supplemented by equal funding from the local
authorities and the Government-funded Tec. Where previously it had been
difficult for developers to get the go-ahead for schemes, because of fears
of over-heating the economy, key sites are now being brought forward and
marketed. These include some very large parcels of land released from
aerospace use.
As part of another initiative, a range of organisations, including the
chamber of commerce, the county, the university and the Tec, is behind plans
for a One Stop Shop, operating from one central and a number of ancillary
sites, which will offer support to new and existing businesses. This has now
won funding from the Department of Trade and Industry, and is expected to
begin operation before the end of the year.
The impact these efforts can make is, inevitably, a matter of some debate.
Dr Al Rainnie, co-director of the local economic research unit at the
university, points to the county's history of relatively slow jobs growth in
the 1980s, when it lagged behind other south-east counties - the result, he
believes, not just of restrictive planning policies, but of a culture of
over-dependence on the then dominant aerospace and defence sectors.
He fears that individuals emerging from those industries will not have the
entrepreneurial skills that the growing companies of the future will
require, and that many of the new jobs that do come into Hertfordshire may
pay less well than those being lost, with some erosion of pay levels also
resulting from increased contracting out of operations previously handled
in-house by big employers.
He is also sceptical about whether the county can hope to be more than
moderately successful in attracting inward investment, in competition not
just with other regions of the UK, able to offer grants and other
inducements, but with the low-wage economies of eastern Europe. 'Our
expectation is that job growth will be disappointing and that many of the
new jobs will not be as good in quality as those they replace,' he argues.
The gloom of this view is challenged, however, by both the county and the
HDO, which see plentiful signs of the county's continuing attractiveness, as
well as some evidence that economic activity has already picked up and the
rate of job loss announcements slowed down.
Many companies, according to Brian Briscoe, chief executive of the county
council, want to be near London but not necessarily within it, and will
continue to be attracted to Hertfordshire for its environment, its proximity
to airports, its road and rail communications, and the wide range of
information technology, engineering, managerial and professional skills it
can offer.
Mitsubishi Electric is one example quoted of the sort of company which has
successfully established itself in the county. Its UK sales, service and
warehousing are all located in Hatfield, where it will now be the largest
industrial employer following the closure of British Aerospace. Nearby, in
Welwyn Garden City, Rank Xerox is establishing its European headquarters.
Another recent arrival, Nissan, last year chose Watford for its UK
distribution headquarters.
Back-office operations continue to be attracted, too, with the latest,
Provident Mutual, shortly to open a Pounds 40m new head office in Stevenage,
where it will employ 900 people. The prospects for attracting large-scale
manufacturing investment are less strong, but, according to Hugh West, chief
executive of the HDO, there will be niche products for which Hertfordshire
will be the most suitable location, because of skills developed by existing
industries - for example, in new materials.
Great hopes are being placed, too, on the pharmaceutical industry and
related healthcare field, already one of the county's biggest industries,
and a sector set to grow even faster in the next century as medical advances
accelerate and the population ages. At Stevenage, the biggest building
project in the UK, apart from the Channel Tunnel, is under way for Glaxo.
This will house an important research and development facility employing up
to 1,500 people, including 900 scientists.
Even without this, Hertfordshire is one of the main centres for
pharmaceutical research in Europe, with SmithKline Beecham, Merck Sharp &amp;
Dohme, Roussel-Uclaf, Roche and Astra Laboratories among the leading names
drawn, along with Glaxo, to operate in the county because of its proximity
to medical research in universities in Oxford, Cambridge and London and to
the London teaching hospitals.
As part of the same development, the University of Hertfordshire has built
up substantial expertise in medical areas. As well as attracting Pounds 1m
of industry funding for a medical professorship, it has won contracts to
carry out paramedical training and nursing training.
It hopes these can be the stepping-stones to a post-graduate medical school,
which could link in with other supporting disciplines in medical electronics
and bio-sciences, and with the important medico-legal work carried out by
its law department.
The impact of these developments lies some way in the future, and the rest
of the 1990s look like continuing to be much more difficult for prosperous
Hertfordshire than the gilded decade before. With its many advantages,
compared with more distant locations, it is hard, however, to see
Hertfordshire failing to adapt to changing economic circumstances, despite
the shocks it has suffered.
Hugh West, at the HDO, points to the site in Stevenage which Provident
Mutual has occupied as an example of what has happened in the past and will
happen again. Less than 50 years ago, it housed heavy engineering, then
switched to sophisticated defence activities which have in turn now made way
for financial services.
Whatever its current problems, it is Hertfordshire's good fortune to be in a
part of the country where such changes can take place.

FT  28 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries lose ground ahead of supply
onslaught
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK, LONDON

<TEXT>
US TREASURY prices tumbled across the board yesterday afternoon as the
market braced itself for the week's onslaught of supply following a
disappointing two-year note auction in the afternoon.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  29/32 at
102 27/32 , yielding 6.895 per cent. At the short end, the three-year note
was  5/32 lower, to yield 4.240 per cent.
Prices were weak in the morning and deteriorated further after the
afternoon's Dollars 15.25bn two-year note auction, where demand was meagre
and the yield was unexpectedly high, at 3.88 per cent.
Overall, market sentiment was negative following reports that Mr Leon
Panetta, budget director for President Bill Clinton, had become discouraged
about prospects for significant deficit reduction this year.
Economic data released in the morning put further pressure on bonds, with an
unexpected rise in the consumer confidence index for April to 67.7, from
63.2 in March.
THE UK government bond market rallied on the eve of today's Pounds 3bn
auction of 7 1/4 per cent five-year gilts which is expected to meet
reasonable demand.
The market was particularly strong at the long end, where stock typically
gained more than half a point. The 8 3/4 per cent bond due 2017, for
instance, advanced by about  5/8 to 103 1/8 .
One reason was that dealers felt the market had been oversold before the
auction. The 'when issued' price for the 7 3/4 bond gained about 3/8 ,
giving a yield of 7.05 per cent.
THE GERMAN market was buoyed in the morning by hopes of an acceleration in
interest rate cuts following a press report of comments by Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, Bundesbank president.
The bund futures contract opened higher at 95.40 and rose to 95.70. But the
message in the article was not unequivocal, and the announcement that there
would be a new bund issue next week took the wind out of the market's sails.
The futures contract ended unchanged.
Today, attention focuses on the repo rate, which is expected to come down
from 8.09 per cent to about 7.90 per cent, taking up most of last week's 25
basis point cut in the discount rate to 7.25 per cent.
THE ITALIAN market made more progress, mainly in the futures market, on the
back of the appointment of central banker Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi as prime
minister-designate.
Although lacking in political experience, he is seen as good news in terms
of support for the lira and a hard line on the budget deficit. Foreign
investors have become keener on Italian stock as the currency risk has
lessened.
A RISE in the Nikkei average index to more than 20,000 and a sharp
improvement in some economic indicators hit the Japanese government bond
market yesterday.
Alongside the rise in an index of leading indicators from 54.5 in January to
80 in February, the Economic Planning Agency fanned recovery hopes by
commenting that the bottom of the cycle had been reached.
The futures contract fell from 109.43 to 108.90, while the yield on the
benchmark 145 issue due 2002 rose to 4.28 per cent from 4.195 per cent.
Traders were also adopting cautious positions before the Golden Week
holidays.
The influence of the currency was evident in London trading. After the yen
hit a high of Y109.20 to the dollar, the futures contract recovered to
109.06. However, intervention by the US Federal Reserve - for the first time
this year on the dollar-yen front - sent both the yen and the futures
contract back the other way.

FT  28 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Convertible Pounds 90m issue
from Forte
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTE, the UK hotels and restaurants group, yesterday announced a Pounds 90m
convertible bond issue due 2008 and paying 6.75 per cent interest.
It said this would help to lengthen the maturity of its debt, which stood at
a net Pounds 1.28bn - gearing of 48 per cent - in January. It also eased the
average interest rate paid to less than 9 per cent. Last year's interest
bill of Pounds 128m was less than twice covered by Pounds 200m trading
profits.
The new bond is unsecured and subordinate to other debt.
The conversion price is 223p, a premium of 15.5 per cent over the market
level at the time of pricing. Yesterday, the stock shed 2p to close at 194
1/2 p.
At the year-end, Forte had Pounds 534m of borrowings due within one year.
This issue, plus February's 25-year Pounds 200m debenture issue, more than
halves that figure.

FT  28 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Tokai Bank senior rating
downgraded by Moody's
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOKAI Bank, a leading Japanese commercial bank, had its senior rating
downgraded from A1 to A2 yesterday by Moody's, the US credit ratings agency,
which said the bank's core earnings were under pressure and non-performing
loans were an increasing burden.
The agency said Tokai, based in the central city of Nagoya, had a 'high
level' of exposure to the international and domestic property markets and,
like many other banks, problems with finance company affiliates, the
so-called non-banks.
Mitsubishi Trust and Banking is to take advantage of financial reforms to
establish a brokerage subsidiary later this year to expand its role in
domestic bond markets.
The Japanese government introduced reforms at the beginning of this month
allowing trust and long-term credit banks to open brokerage subsidiaries,
though excluding these units from dealing in the stock market.
Banks expect that the finance ministry will broaden the range of
institutions permitted to open new subsidiaries next year, and gradually
allow them to deal in stocks. Mitsubishi said its new unit would be
capitalised at about Y20bn and employ 30 staff.

FT  28 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: India approves plan for
national stock exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDIAN government yesterday approved controversial plans for the
establishment of a National Stock Exchange, a potential rival for the Bombay
Stock Exchange and other provincial exchanges.
The plans, advanced by the finance ministry and leading state-owned
financial institutions, envisage the creation of a Rs1bn (Dollars 32m)
nationwide computer-based trading system for a wide range of financial
instruments, including equities, bonds and short-term paper.
The proposals are likely to provoke fierce battles in the financial
community, with the institutions ranged against stockbrokers who see the
plans as a threat to their business. Brokers also doubt whether such an
ambitious scheme can be introduced rapidly in India, given the country's
chronic shortages of telephone lines and other services vital for a national
computer-based market.
The government yesterday set out a tight timetable for the new exchange  -
saying that money market instruments would be traded by the end of the
current financial year in March 1994. Capital market instruments, including
equities, would be introduced later.
The government said in a statement that its aim was to ensure greater
transparency and better protection for investors. 'The exchange will also
help in bringing the Indian capital market in line with international
markets,' it added.
Government officials believe last year's Rs40bn Bombay securities market
scandal highlighted many weaknesses in the existing stock markets, including
unclear trading practices, poor book-keeping by brokers and late
settlements.
Even though the affair centred on the inter-bank market and not the stock
exchange, stockbrokers played a key role in channelling funds illegally from
banks into equity investments.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India, the newly-appointed securities
market watchdog, has been struggling in its efforts to bring greater
discipline to the stock markets. Brokers complain that the authorities have
been heavy-handed and have failed to understand the subtleties of stock
trading.

FT  28 APR 93 / International Bonds: Osaka Gas turns attention to dollar
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIGGEST transactions in the Eurobond market yesterday were in the US
dollar and French franc sectors, where investor appetite appears to be
strong.
Osaka Gas, the Japanese utility, tapped the US dollar sector with a Dollars
250m five-year bond bearing a 5 3/4 per cent coupon.
The borrower has a large capital expenditure programme and is keen to
establish a benchmark for further bond issues, according to Goldman Sachs,
lead manager for the issue. The proceeds, which will be swapped into yen,
will go towards the building of new liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals
and pipelines.
The deal was launched at a spread of 57 basis points over the five-year US
Treasury bond, and the spread tightened slightly to 56 basis points, the
lead manager said. Osaka Gas has a AA2/AA- credit rating, and last tapped
the Eurobond market with a CDollars 200m five-year deal in September 1991.
The trend for collared floating-rate notes, which have proved a popular form
of issue over the past year, continued yesterday as Citicorp launched a
Dollars 200m 10-year deal. Citicorp's issue, lead-managed by Kidder Peabody,
was quickly increased in size from Dollars 100m in order to meet strong
demand from Tokyo, Hong Kong, the Middle East and Europe.
Dealers pointed out that the Eurobond market has seen a steady stream of
collared FRN deals. The flow started with a handful of top, triple-A credits
leading the way. 'Although the top credits initially led the way, investors
now seem willing to buy less outstanding credits,' said one syndicate
manager. Citibank is rated BAA3/BBB+ on its subordinated debt.
The lead manager said the collared FRN route provided 'a great opportunity
to raise capital cheaply in the European markets', and added that the 5 1/2
per cent floor was considered very generous given that three-month Libor is
currently around 3 1/4 to 3 3/16 per cent.
A Dollars 300m, 12-year bond for Export-Import Bank of Japan attracted
criticism as some syndicates complained about the maturity, arguing that the
yield pick-up was not much better than they would have seen on a 10-year
bond from the same borrower. The bond has a coupon of 6.25 per cent; the
deal was launched at 33 basis points over the 10-year Treasury bond and
managed to hold its spread.

<TEXT>
ZENITH Electronics, the last US manufacturer of television sets, suffered a
loss of Dollars 21.8m in the first quarter, or 72 cents a share. The loss is
slightly lower than last year's deficit of Dollars 28.6m, or 98 cents.
The operating loss narrowed to Dollars 18.6m in the quarter, from Dollars
25.9m a year ago, while revenues improved in the quarter to Dollars 290.5m,
compared with Dollars 265.2m.
The sales increase came mainly from shipments of colour televisions.
However, losses mounted because television prices continued to decline in
the quarter. Lower pricing offset higher sales volume and corporate cost
reductions, according to Mr Jerry Pearlman, Zenith president.
The company had said it intended to cut costs by Dollars 75m this year,
following cost reductions of more than Dollars 50m in 1992.
Zenith is consolidating operations in Mexico, where the majority of its
television sets are assembled.
First-quarter results include more than Dollars 5m in royalty income from
tuning system licences, the company said.
Zenith this month received a commitment for Dollars 90m in new revolving
credit, which will give the company breathing room to continue with its
restructuring plan.

<TEXT>
HAMBROS Australia, part of Hambros Bank of London, has formed a
joint-venture stockbroking firm with China's principal overseas trading
corporation to operate on emerging Chinese stock exchanges.
CITIC Australia, a unit of China International Trust and Investment
Corporation Holdings (CITIC), said it initiated the joint venture in the
hope of stimulating flagging Australian interest in Chinese stocks.
The broking firm, to be called CH China Securities, is the first joint
stockbroking venture since Chinese companies began issuing B shares for
foreign investors last year.
CH China Securities is authorised as a foreign broker on the Shenzhen stock
exchange and is to apply for Shanghai exchange authority.
Mr Jijing Zhang, managing director of CITIC Australia, said there was little
Australian interest in Chinese stocks 'because Australians are a
conservative people and they do not really know much about the market'.
Mr Alan Humphris, a director of Hambros Corporate Advisory, said share
trades would be handled by Hambros, but CITIC would supply the joint venture
with economic and industrial analysis.
'I think that, with the CITIC entree, we will get a very good handle on the
economy, the markets and the companies, and that will give us quite an
advantage over the foreign brokers operating out of Hong Kong,' he said.
Mr Humphris said Australian financial institutions were monitoring the
Chinese markets, but most had 'minimal exposure', partly because of concerns
about accounting standards and disclosure rules.

another six local banks
</HEADLINE>

   LONDON, MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEXICAN government is set to authorise six new banks for business in the
near future, a senior finance ministry official said in London yesterday.
Mr Guillermo Ortiz, finance under-secretary, said the government had
received six applications to open banking institutions and expected to
authorise all soon.
The authorisation, despite opposition from owners of some of the 18 existing
banks privatised for a total Dollars 12.6bn in the past two years, reflects
government determination to extend competition in the financial sector.
It hopes this will bring down the huge spreads between deposit rates, now
around 17 per cent, and lending rates, often around 35 per cent for
medium-sized companies.
Four applicants have been widely reported in the Mexican press.
Mr Carlos Slim Helu, owner of Inbursa, a brokerage, and president of Grupo
Carso, which controls Telefonos de Mexico, is to start a bank with national
coverage that would complement Inbursa.
Similarly, Mr Carlos Hank Rhon - who runs the Interacciones brokerage, the
Seguros La Republica insurance company and a wide variety of other
businesses - is also seeking to open a national bank.
Mr Eduardo Creel, from the financial group Bursamex, wants to open a
regional bank with headquarters in Merida. Mr Jose Gaspar Espinosa, a
leading businessman from the state of Sinaloa, is hoping to open a regional
bank in Culiacan, the state capital.
The government will compel the new banks to satisfy a minimum capital
requirement of some Dollars 32.3m, to reveal their principal shareholders
and directors, and to disclose their intended locations, number of branches,
and the businesses on which they will focus.
The newly authorised banks will all be Mexican-owned.

FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Chicago opens Euromark futures
and options pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Chicago Mercantile Exchange yesterday opened three-month Euromark
futures and options pits, aiming to compete with Liffe in London which so
far this year has traded more than 6m Euromark futures and maintains open
interest at 500,000 contracts.
But CME traders believe they can take a slice of the market by capitalising
on their options trading expertise and by offering the Chicago version of
Euromark derivatives on the Globex electronic trading system through the
Asian-Pacific business day. Using Globex, CME Euromark products will be open
for either floor or electronic trading nearly 20 hours a day.
First-day volume - at 1,279 futures and 1,279 options traded in the pit, and
100 contracts traded on Globex - was modest. The Euromarks are the latest
weapon to be wielded in the battle for market share between Chicago and
London.
As the D-Mark increasingly dominates world foreign exchange trading,
Euromark derivatives are growing in volume. Some traders feel Liffe's
Euromark futures volume could surpass the CME's Eurodollar turnover, which
has been averaging more than 5m contracts a month for a notional value of
more than Dollars 5,000bn.

The company's biggest investment is a 10 per cent stake in the Portland

CRA, the Australian resources group, had acquired 70 per cent of Coal and
Allied (Cail), Australia's third-largest coal producer, when its bid of
ADollars 11.50 (USDollars 8.27) a share closed yesterday.
The group said it was 'very satisfied with the outcome of this offer',
although its hopes of acquiring 100 per cent of Cail fell when Ube
Industries of Japan, the second-largest shareholder, said it would not sell
its 11 per cent holding.
CRA, which first tried to take control of Cail two years ago, is the largest
coal producer in the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales.

FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Fresh equity for GD Express
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TNT, the Australian transport group, plans to inject ADollars 50m (USDollars
36m) in fresh equity into its lossmaking GD Express Worldwide joint venture
with five European and North American post offices.
In a letter to the Australian Stock Exchange, TNT confirmed speculation that
GD Express would require a further ADollars 100m in equity 'assuming no
change in operating circumstances'.
TNT is required to provide half of any fresh equity needed to maintain the
joint venture's 50-50 debt-to-equity ratio. The balance will be split
between the post offices of Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, France and
Canada.
GD Express has been a consistent loss-maker since it was established in
1991, partly in an attempt to absorb unused capacity within TNT's European
aircraft fleet.
TNT reported net restructuring, establishment and loss-funding costs of
ADollars 68.9m for GD Express in 1991-92, which contributed to the group's
second consecutive annual loss of nearly ADollars 200m.
The joint venture removed more than ADollars 900m of debt from TNT's balance
sheet, but start-up costs have significantly delayed the group's forecast
that GD Express would move into profit by June 1992.
TNT made a net loss of Dollars A74.5m in the six months ended December, and
expects to return to profit in 1993-94.

Bank

FINLAND'S government guarantee fund said yesterday it had pumped FM1.1bn
(Dollars 204m) into the Savings Bank of Finland to save it from slipping
below international capital adequacy requirements when it reports interim
results at the end of this month.
The capital injection, made up of FM150m to increase the bank's share
capital and FM950m to purchase preferred capital certificates issued by the
bank, brought to FM13bn the total the guarantee fund has been forced to
invest in Savings Bank, which was formed last year following the merger of
41 small savings institutions.
Savings Bank has been the biggest consumer of aid from the fund, which was
set up to bail out Finland's banking system. The government has yet to
decide on the future of Savings Bank and Skopbank, the savings banks'
central bank.
The fund, which has access to FM40bn for recapitalising the banking system,
said earlier negotiations with Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, the country's leading
commercial bank, about a possible merger of the two with KOP were not
proceeding 'at this stage'.

FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Gencor lifts income 6% despite
weak markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SOUND operating performance against a background of depressed commodity
markets saw attributable income at Gencor, South Africa's second-largest
mining house, increase by 6 per cent to R593m (Dollars 188.7m) in the six
months to February.
Mr Brian Gilbertson, executive chairman, said he believed Gencor's
operational performance compared favourably with other resource companies.
He said the board had yet to decide whether it was in favour of the break-up
of the group's non-mining interests. He said that a decision would be taken
by the end of June at the latest, if not much sooner.
Although the larger number of shares in issue saw earnings per share decline
by 10 per cent to 43.1 cents, the dividend is being maintained at 16 cents a
share.
Mr Gilbertson said Gencor was unlikely to maintain the level of earnings
reported during the current six months. He said commodity prices remained
very weak, with few signs of an upturn.
Despite the poor outlook, he said that on very conservative forward
assumptions, Gencor would have no financial problems in funding the large
capital projects - Alusaf, Columbus, the Engen refinery upgrade and the
expansion of Sappi's Saiccor plant - it is committed to.
Mr Gilbertson expressed regret that the group had not made more progress in
establishing an offshore presence. He said tighter Reserve Bank restrictions
on offshore deals made such ventures difficult to achieve.
Lower capital expenditure and a much improved performance from Western Areas
helped the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment group post a 45 per cent
increase in profit after tax and capital expenditure in the March quarter to
R36.5m, against R25.2m.
This increase was achieved despite further operational setbacks at the Joel
mine, where continued poor grades saw gold production fall by 14 per cent.
After-tax profit slid to R1.7m from R5.2m.

FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Shareholders in Petrofina deny
stake sale plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PETROFINA'S two largest shareholders yesterday made clear they were not
planning to sell their stakes in the Belgian oil and gas company, and would
work together to encourage the group's development.
Mr Albert Frere, Petrofina chairman and head of Groupe Bruxelles Lambert,
the Belgian holding company which controls a 21.5 per cent stake in the
company, said he wanted to 'cut short' speculation surrounding Petrofina.
That speculation has centred on a 4.9 per cent stake in Petrofina built up
by Elf Aquitaine, the French state-controlled oil company. Elf's presence
has buoyed the Petrofina share price with rumours of a possible takeover.
But Elf repeated in a statement yesterday that its holding was 'a financial
investment, which was neither unfriendly nor hostile in character'.
Mr Frere, who controls a further 6.55 per cent of Petrofina through private
companies, was addressing shareholders at an extraordinary meeting called to
approve a series of defensive measures.
At the same meeting, Viscount Etienne Davignon, chairman of Societe Generale
de Belgique, Belgium's largest holding company, said the group was 'solidly
behind' GBL in its support for Petrofina.
He confirmed that La Generale had no intention of selling its 11.33 per cent
stake in Petrofina, which is Belgium's largest industrial company.
The shareholders were unable to adopt the defensive measures, which would
bring Petrofina in line with recently implemented Belgian company
legislation, because they represented only a minority of the shares.
The proposals will now be put to the vote at the May 14 annual meeting,
where a quorum is not necessary.

FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Swiss group attempts to call the
tune at Piper - A controversial suitor for the US producer of light aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT 10am tomorrow, a gaggle of lawyers will convene in a Miami bankruptcy
courtroom. At stake will be the future of one of the best-known, although
sadly-blemished, names in US civil aviation: Piper Aircraft Corporation.
For months, bidders have been sniffing around Piper, one of the last
manufacturers of 'little planes' in the US. But a firm offer has now arrived
from Pilatus, a Swiss aircraft manufacturer and part of the Oerlikon-Buhrle
weapons and engineering group.
Unfortunately, Pilatus could prove a controversial suitor; its chief
executive, Mr Walter Gubler, was sacked last month after Swiss press reports
that the company had sold aeroplanes to the Burmese government, knowing they
would be equipped with weapons.
Pilatus also has a commercially important, but politically-contentious,
agreement to deliver SFr250m (Dollars 176m) worth of training aircraft to
the South African Ministry of Defence.
Shortly after the order was announced last December, the South African
committee of the United Nations Security Council complained to the Swiss
government that it violated the UN embargo on arms shipments to South
Africa. The African National Congress also opposed the sale.
Such touchy background issues might prove valuable ammunition should other
suitors wish to start a bid battle.
An auction is, at least, a possibility. Piper's lawyers are asking the court
to set up a bidding procedure, and claim two potential rival suitors will
attend tomorrow's hearing. One of these, according to Mr Paul Singerman,
Piper's attorney, has said it will raise the South African issue should it
proceed with an offer.
The rationale for the Swiss interest is fairly straightforward. Pilatus
makes small single-engine turbo-prop aircraft.
Two models - the PC-6 and the Islander (made by the company's Britten-Norman
subsidiary in the UK) - are mainly for civil uses, while the PC-7 and the
PC-9 are mainly for training fighter pilots.
However, the Islander is sometimes used in a defence role, equipped with
radar. The PC-7s and PC-9s have also been 'misused' as bombers; aside from
the Burmese affair, there have been reports of Pilatus aircraft figuring in
conflicts in other countries, including Iraq and Angola.
Today, according to Pilatus, about 60 per cent of revenues comes from
training aircraft, the rest from civil aircraft and maintenance work for
third parties. The company had sales of more than SFr250m last year and a
first-half operating profit of SFr22m against a loss the previous year.
However, in the late 1980s, the Swiss company decided it wanted a greater
presence in the civil aircraft market. So it developed the PC-12, which
aimed to undercut existing models in the small corporate aircraft market,
especially in the US. The PC-12 - powered, like the PC-7 and PC-9, by Pratt
&amp; Whitney engines made in Montreal - is expected to win certification by the
end of the year. That is why the company is suddenly in a hurry to set up a
US base.
Pilatus says it would carry out final assembly of the PC-12 at Piper in
Florida; indeed, its offer claims manufacturing work to be done by Piper for
Pilatus would add Dollars 24m to the former's value. In the meantime, it is
investigating three other US tie-ups for partial assemblies, some of which
would augment work done at Piper, some of which would provide alternative
manufacturing capacity.
Mr Oskar Brundler, finance director, says the advantages of the Piper
acquisition are the obvious ones: getting an existing product line, a
worldwide sales and distribution network, and a famous name.
Piper, meanwhile, has being looking for a saviour for years, having been
shunted between different owners since the Piper family bowed out in the
1970s.
Rescue efforts have been derailed by the product liability problem. Aircraft
accidents have resulted in millions of dollars of legal claims, and driven
insurance liability premiums sky-high.
This issue alone explains why most other manufacturers of 'little planes' in
the US, including Cessna, have quit the market.
Piper held lengthy negotiations with Aerospatiale in 1991 but the French
aircraft manufacturer never proceeded with a deal, because of the product
liability issue. Shortly afterwards, in July, Piper filed for Chapter 11
protection.
Since then, rumoured suitors for Piper have included a couple of investment
consortia, which wanted to transfer manufacturing to Canada, and another
involving relocation to an Indian reservation in New Mexico. In all cases,
the relocations were designed to ameliorate the liability problem.
The Pilatus plan takes a different tack - a portion of Piper's assets,
including part of the Dollars 20m which Pilatus would pay in cash, would be
set aside to meet potential claims. Pilatus would then acquire the other
assets 'free and clear' of all product liability claims.
In US bankruptcy terms, this is not an entirely novel suggestion. But it
could help to make Piper more attractive. The company can also boast an
improvement on the operating front: having virtually ceased production at
the time of the bankruptcy filing, it delivered 85 aircraft last year. There
was a small Dollars 7m operating profit on sales of Dollars 47m. A shadow of
its former glory, perhaps, but progress none the less.

CANADIAN Pacific Forest Products narrowed its losses in the first quarter
due to strong construction timber markets, larger newsprint and white paper
shipments, lower costs and a lower Canadian dollar.
The net loss was CDollars 64.8m (USDollars 51.8m), or Dollars 1.23 a share,
against a loss of Dollars 71.1m, or Dollars 1.47, a year earlier.
Sales were Dollars 450m, against Dollars 430m.
US newsprint prices east of the Rockies have gone up 10 per cent, but a
similar increase in the west has been postponed until midsummer.

promotion in UK

<TEXT>
MAYTAG, the US appliances group, yesterday announced a net loss of Dollars
10.5m in the first quarter after taking a Dollars 30m special charge to
cover the cost of the controversial 'free flights' promotion by its Hoover
subsidiary in the UK.
The promotion, which offered free flights to the US for purchasers of more
than Pounds 100 of Hoover products, backfired when Hoover was swamped by an
unexpectedly high take-up rate.
Mr Leonard Hadley, Maytag's chairman, told the company's annual meeting it
had now bought a block of tickets on 11 airlines, covering 1,100 flights,
'to take care of customers over the next six months.'
He said the episode was like a 'bad accident and you can't determine what
was in the driver's mind,' and hinted that other employees could lose their
jobs over the affair, in addition to three already dismissed.
He said Maytag's earnings would hopefully improve this year, thanks to a new
integrated sales approach in North America and new product models.
The first-quarter loss, which worked through at 10 cents a share, compared
with a loss of Dollars 282.3m, or Dollars 2.66 a share, after accounting
changes in the first period of 1992.
Excluding the various charges, net income totalled Dollars 19.5m, compared
with Dollars 24.7m a year ago, while sales dropped from Dollars 753.2m to
Dollars 716.9m.

<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL Airlines, the fifth-largest US carrier, was last night poised to
emerge from bankruptcy court protection, after finalising an investment
agreement with Air Canada and Air Partners, a Texan investment group.
It is two and a half years since Houston-based Continental sought Chapter 11
protection from its creditors. Continental also went in and out of
bankruptcy during the 1980s.
In Delaware, the company's lawyers were reported to be the putting finishing
touches to the investment deal, which would give Air Canada and Air Partners
a 55 per cent stake in Continental. The carrier announced that it would hold
a press conference this morning, to herald its emergence from protection.
The company's reorganisation plan has been approved by creditors and the
bankruptcy court judge.
The larger US carriers have complained about unfair competition from
bankrupt airlines, who get relief from debt payments and some other
operating advantages. Continental's emergence would leave America West and
TWA operating under Chapter 11 protection.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
R. J. REYNOLDS, the domestic US tobacco arm of the R. J. R. Nabisco food and
cigarettes group, is to match the large price cuts in full-priced cigarette
brands that Philip Morris, its big rival, announced this month.
Reynolds said it would slash the price of its Winston brand by Dollars 4 a
carton, or 40 cents a packet. It would also increase promotion of its Camel
brand, although it declined to be more specific.
'Frankly, we'd like to stay light on our feet,' Reynolds said.
The Reynolds cuts will apply to June only, and no other brands will
participate. The company said it would reassess the position in late June.
Winston is one of Reynolds's flagship brands and the one which competes most
closely with Philip Morris's Marlboro. Camel is also a non-menthol,
full-priced brand, although its total US market share, at about 4.1 per cent
last year, was smaller than Winston's, taking close to 7 per cent.
Philip Morris's decision to reduce the price of Marlboro, the best-selling
US cigarette brand, by 40 cents a packet (from about Dollars 2.10-Dollars
2.20 to Dollars 1.70-Dollars 1.80), sent the cigarette market into turmoil
earlier this month.
Reynolds, which has almost 29 per cent of the US cigarette market, against
Philip Morris's 43 per cent, said it intended to remain competitive, but had
not previously detailed its response.

<TEXT>
BOEING, the world's biggest aircraft manufacturer, underscored the recession
in the global aerospace industry by reporting a 23 per cent drop in
first-quarter earnings to Dollars 325m, or 96 cents a share, on sales of
Dollars 6.64bn, compared with Dollars 420m, or Dollars 1.23, on sales of
Dollars 7.97bn in the same period of last year.
The figures were in line with analysts' expectations of about Dollars 1 a
share.
Boeing said the drop was due to lower sales of commercial aircraft and
defence and space equipment. It delivered 93 commercial aircraft during the
quarter, compared with 124 in the same period of 1992.
Commercial aircraft sales dropped to Dollars 5.50bn from Dollars 6.54bn,
while defence and space sales dipped to Dollars 1.01bn from Dollars 1.29bn.
Mr Frank Shrontz, chairman, said second-quarter sales were expected to be
higher due mainly to the timing of commercial jet deliveries, but
second-half sales would be lower than the first half, reflecting reductions
in commercial production rates.
For the full year, Boeing projected sales of about Dollars 26bn, down from
Dollars 30.2bn last year.

SEARS Canada, one of the country's biggest retailers, predicts a return to
profitability this year after posting its worst loss for 40 years in 1992.
The first-quarter loss was CDollars 21.8m (USDollars 17.4m) or 23 cents a
share, a 40 per cent improvement on the loss of CDollars 35.6m, or 42 cents,
a year earlier. Sales slipped slightly to CDollars 772m.
Last year, Sears Canada, in which Sears, Roebuck of the US is the largest
shareholder, restructured and laid off several thousand workers. It operates
109 stores across Canada, and its national catalogue sales business.
Biochem Pharma, the main Canadian associate of Glaxo Holdings, the UK
pharmaceuticals group, posted a loss of CDollars 13.1m, or 32 cents, for the
year ended January 31 after special items, against profits of CDollars
12.6m, or 37 cents, a year earlier.

PEPSICO, the soft drinks, restaurants, and snacks group, yesterday reported
after-tax profits of Dollars 260.4m in the 12 weeks to March 20, the first
quarter of its financial year.
Ahead of accounting-related charges, this reflected an 11 per cent
improvement on the same period of 1992.
Sales were up 13 per cent at Dollars 5.09bn, while earnings per share
advanced 10 per cent to 32 cents a share.
PepsiCo said domestic business did particularly well, with profits rising 23
per cent - the strongest growth it has seen in nine quarters.
On the international front, progress was held back by weak economies in the
UK and Australia and unfavourable currency movements.

BETHLEHEM Steel, the second largest integrated steel company in the US,
announced a Dollars 41m first-quarter net loss, while Nucor, the largest US
mini-mill group, reported a 33 per cent rise in net earnings to Dollars
21.7m.
The US steel industry has been suffering from a cyclical downturn in prices
and demand, though some of the more nimble, low-cost mini-mill
manufacturers, notably Nucor, have avoided the heavy losses suffered by the
large, integrated companies.
Bethlehem expects to return to profitability this year.
Mr Curtis Barnette, chairman, said there were encouraging signs of 'an
increase in steel demand and the restoration of fair value for our
products.' There had been a significant increase in orders.
Its net loss was 54 cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 36m, or
55 cents, last time, excluding changes in accounting practice. Sales
totalled Dollars 1.02bn (Dollars 995m).
Nucor's earnings, lower than most forecasts, were 50 cents a share, up from
38 cents. Sales totalled Dollars 489m, against Dollars 388m.

<TEXT>
ITT, the US conglomerate, yesterday reported a 27 per cent rise in
first-quarter net income, thanks to sharply better performances at its
finance, automotive and hotels businesses.
The improvement came in spite of Dollars 41m of extraordinary catastrophe
losses at its ITT Hartford insurance subsidiary, due to a severe winter
storm and the February bombing of New York's World Trade Center, and a drop
in after-tax portfolio gains at Hartford and ITT Financial to Dollars 42m
from Dollars 84m.
Net income totalled Dollars 175m, or Dollars 1.30 a share fully diluted,
compared with net income of Dollars 138m, or Dollars 1, in the same period
of last year, excluding accounting changes. Sales were static at Dollars
5.1bn.
The figures were at the upper end of analysts' expectations and ITT shares
rose Dollars 2 1/8 in morning trading on the New York stock exchange to
stand at Dollars 80 3/4 .
ITT Financial, which was the subject of a Dollars 612m fourth-quarter
after-tax restructuring charge, reported income of Dollars 67m, up from
Dollars 32m, due to lower loss provisions and borrowing costs.
The automotive business saw income rise to Dollars 32m from Dollars 19m,
following 'cost improvement actions,' while the Sheraton Hotels group
transformed a Dollars 16m loss into Dollars 16m of profits, helped by
'higher occupancy and rates, particularly in the renovated New York city
properties and significantly lower overhead expenses'.
ITT Hartford reported income of Dollars 156m, down from Dollars 168m, though
excluding portfolio gains and extraordinary losses the business had improved
operating results.

MOBIL, the big US energy group, yesterday reported a first-quarter 1993 net
profit of Dollars 490m, or Dollars 1.19 a share, against a loss of Dollars
319m last time, following accounting charges.
With last year's accounting charges stripped out, the year-on-year
comparison shows first-quarter earnings more than doubled this year, from
Dollars 277m a year ago.
Revenues were Dollars 15bn, a decrease of 1 per cent year-on-year.
Mr Allen Murray, chairman, said while there was sluggish economic growth in
Europe, the US economy had picked up and US gas prices recovered to more
traditional winter levels. He said Mobil continued to focus on restructuring
efforts and reported that operating expenses were down year-on-year in the
US.
Exploration and production earnings were Dollars 433m, up from Dollars 175m
a year ago.
US operating earnings for exploration and production were Dollars 117m while
non-US earnings were Dollars 316m.
Marketing and refining earnings were Dollars 134m, an increase of Dollars
82m year-on-year.
Chemical division earnings were Dollars 21m, against Dollars 10m a year ago.
Worldwide capital and exploration expenditures for the first quarter of 1993
were Dollars 815m, or 10 per cent lower than last year.
Chevron, the fourth-biggest US energy group, also reported buoyant
first-quarter results.
Net income was Dollars 501m, or Dollars 1.54 per share, up 47 per cent on
the previous year's quarterly income before special accounting charges.
Total revenues were Dollars 9.8bn, compared with Dollars 9.7bn a year ago.
Capital and exploration spending was Dollars 778m in the quarter, down from
Dollars 1.08bn a year ago.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A change in the organisation of Xerox's US salesforce disrupted
first-quarter sales and helped hold back revenue growth and profits, the
document processing company reported yesterday.
Xerox reported net income of Dollars 189m, or Dollars 1.77 a share, against
a loss of Dollars 529m, or Dollars 5.68, in the same period of last year
when it took accounting charges.
Income from the core document processing business was Dollars 125m, or
Dollars 1.12, against Dollars 103m, or 91 cents, last year, while revenues
were unchanged at Dollars 3.3bn. The results were helped by a one-time
Dollars 17m Brazilian tax benefit, and pre-tax profits on the document
processing side were essentially unchanged.
The company said lower equipment sales and weakness in the Japanese economy,
which hit profits of Fuji Xerox, had been offset by continued expense
control, including 800 job cuts in the first quarter.
Document processing revenues grew 2 per cent, excluding currency factors,
with new digital products showing growth of 34 per cent. But revenues from
black and white copiers were down 2 per cent.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NET INCOME at CS Holding, the financial services group which includes Credit
Suisse among its operations, rose by just 5 per cent to SFr1.03bn (Dollars
726m) last year.
This follows heavy provisions on Swiss lending and a fall in net income at
CS First Boston, the group's 63 per cent owned investment bank.
However, Mr Rainer Gut, chairman, said the first quarter of this year had
been 'very, very good' in Switzerland, with cash-flow up by 20 per cent
compared with the same period last year.
Provisions of SFr1.52m at Credit Suisse, announced last month, accounted for
the bulk of the group's SFr1.77bn of provisions and write-downs. Provisions
would reach almost the same level this year, said Mr Josef Ackermann,
president of the executive board.
Volksbank said its first-quarter result clearly surpassed that of the same
period in 1992 and exceeded targets. Its assets fell to SFr44.95bn at the
end of March from SFr46.01bn at the end of December, reflecting the transfer
of its international branches' assets to Credit Suisse.
CS First Boston reported net income of Dollars 176m, down from Dollars 216m
the previous year, as its tax charge jumped by Dollars 51m to Dollars 101m.
The 1991 figures had benefited from tax losses carried forward from previous
years, said Mr John Hennessy, chief executive of the investment bank.
Revenues at CS First Boston rose by Dollars 214m to Dollars 1.82bn, as
investment banking contributed Dollars 868m, up from Dollars 703m in 1991.
Mr Gut said the group had decided to drop a plan, announced two years ago,
to sell up to 20 per cent of Credit Suisse to raise additional capital.
Instead, it is launching an American depositary receipt programme this week
in the US to encourage investors there 'to participate in future capital
increases'.

revolt

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's largest bank, last
night brushed aside an attempt by small investors to call directors to
account for last year's heavy losses by marshalling the support of
institutional and other large shareholders, including the Wallenberg family.
A call by Aktiespararna, the 65,000-member national shareholders'
association, for a postponement at SE Banken's annual general meeting of a
usually routine item discharging the board of any liability in respect of
the bank's 1992 activities was easily defeated when representatives of
several large shareholders cast their votes against the move. The item was
then passed.
The large shareholders included the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation,
which holds 5.43 per cent of SE Banken, and Investor, the Wallenberg
investment vehicle which owns 1.72 per cent.
Among institutional shareholders voting against Aktiespararna's call were
the SPP, Trygg-Hansa and Skandia life insurance concerns. Little more than
half of the small shareholders among the 1,500 present at the meeting
supported the postponement call.
The shareholders' association wanted a board shake-up following last year's
catastrophic results, when SE Banken returned operating losses of SKr5.37bn
(Dollars 705m) and reported loan losses of SKr10.9bn.
The association, which last week forced the board at Volvo to reveal details
of executive salaries for the first time, argued that large shareholders in
Sweden have not exerted sufficient control over the running of companies.
Mr Bjorn Svedberg, the chief executive appointed last September, told
shareholders the bank's operations had shown an upturn this year -
first-quarter results are due on May 12 - but repeated earlier warnings of
more high lending losses this year and next.

fall

<TEXT>
A SHARP decline in earnings from fibre operations caused net profits at
Akzo, the Dutch chemicals group, to fall by 23 per cent to Fl 157.9m
(Dollars 87.7m) in the first quarter of 1993.
The company blamed the downturn on lower sales and selling prices for
textile and industrial fibres in Europe, a trend that first became apparent
in the second half of 1992. Operating profit in fibres plummeted by 79 per
cent to Fl 14m from Fl 66m in the first quarter of 1992.
Another factor behind the profit decline was an extraordinary loss of Fl 13m
due mainly to Akzo's transfer of a 51 per cent stake in its European carbon
fibre business to Toho Rayon.
However, Akzo said the first quarter results, excluding extraordinaries,
represented an improvement of Fl 43m over the final quarter of 1992.
Pharmaceuticals, which in recent years has been the main force behind Akzo's
profit growth, reported virtually unchanged operating results of Fl 129m,
reflecting what the company described as disappointing earnings in Germany.
In coatings, results fell by 14 per cent to Fl 24m. Chemicals earnings
totalled Fl 121m compared with Fl 123m. Overall, net sales fell by 3.8 per
cent to Fl 4.23bn, of which about half was due to lower sales by volume.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications equipment maker, is
banking on higher capital spending by US regional telephone companies and
continuing strong demand from eastern Asia and Latin America to reverse a 29
per cent slide in first-quarter earnings.
First-quarter earnings dipped to USDollars 75.9m, or 30 cents a common
share, from Dollars 104.2m, or 41 cents, a year earlier. Revenues edged up
to Dollars 1.94bn from Dollars 1.90bn.
Northern warned last month that its performance would be dented by sagging
sales of high-margin software. The company has also lifted outlays on
research and development, and spent heavily on a venture with Matra, the
French electronics group.
Mr Jean Monty, who took over as chief executive earlier this year from Dr
Paul Stern, declined to forecast 1993 earnings, beyond saying he expected
the second half to be stronger than the first.
He said growth in earnings needed to be balanced against other, longer-term
measures of performance, such as the need to maintain market share, customer
service and the launch of new products.
The US disappointed in the first quarter. Capital spending by regional phone
companies, Northern's biggest US customers, has stagnated. But Mr Monty said
growth in the number of lines connected to their networks pointed to higher
outlays later in the year.
Performance was also hurt by the weakness of sterling, which affected
dollar-denominated revenues from Europe.
Mr Monty said his priorities since taking over had included cost containment
and efforts to improve the effectiveness of Northern's R&amp;D effort.
He said Northern expected to announce a new wireless venture in the UK
within the next few days, although he declined to provide further details.

<TEXT>
ASCOM, the Swiss telecommunications equipment group, tumbled into a SFr46m
(Dollars 32m) loss last year, and the directors are recommending that the
dividend be passed. Last year, it paid SFr70 on the bearer shares.
News of the loss, which contradicted earlier indications from the group that
its 1992 profit would be 50 per cent lower than the previous year's, sent
its shares sliding yesterday. The bearer shares closed down SFr180 at
SFr1,380.
The group, which has been striving to develop a competitive international
presence in anticipation of the liberalisation of Swiss telecoms markets,
said in a statement that the unexpected loss arose following a special
examination of some of its activities which led to inventory write-downs.
It cited its cable television activities in Germany and its private mobile
radio business. It said it had also streamlined its product range to cut
costs and invested in new market development.
The statement said that the group's strategy of concentrating on the growth
area of corporate networks was beginning to produce results. Total revenues
rose 9 per cent to SFr3.37bn last year and orders received were up 10 per
cent to SFr3.2bn.

EURO DISNEY, the leisure group which this month celebrated the first
birthday of the Euro Disneyland theme park near Paris, yesterday announced
that it lost FFr1.08bn (Dollars 203m) in the first half of this year and
that it was seeking new capital.
The group, which is already in discussions with its banks to try to
restructure its FFr20bn debt, said it needed new funds to alleviate the
impact of 'anticipated losses' and to prevent its working capital
requirements from having an 'adverse effect on the cash and financial
position'.
Euro Disney confirmed that it had begun negotiations over the
recapitalisation with Disney, the US entertainment group which is its 49 per
cent shareholder. However it said the refinancing plan was at 'a very
preliminary stage' and that it could not comment on sources of new capital,
nor on the amount required.
The group has failed to meet its financial targets since Euro Disneyland
opened last spring. The park is expected to have attracted 11m visitors by
the end of this month, making it France's second most popular tourist
attraction after Notre-Dame cathedral. But income from hotels, catering and
merchandising had fallen.
The winter period, which falls in the first half of the financial year, was
always expected to be the most difficult time for the park, but the outcome
was worse than expected. Euro Disneyland attracted 3.3m visitors during the
first half, when hotel occupancy reached 37 per cent.
Euro Disney received FFr1.79bn in revenue during the six months to March 31
(comparisons with the previous year are invalid because the park was not
open) but incurred FFr1.32bn of operating costs and FFr1.72bn of
administrative expenses.

FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Four carriers unveil joint
venture plan

FOUR medium-sized European airlines - Scandinavian Airlines System, KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair and Austrian Airlines - yesterday moved
closer to integration by announcing plans to set up a jointly-owned company
with a single management and balance sheet by next year.
The proposal would result in SAS, KLM and Swissair each holding 30 per cent
of the new company and Austrian Airlines 10 per cent.
The airlines are seeking to become a 'fourth force' in the deregulated
European market alongside the 'big three' - British Airways, Air France and
Lufthansa of Germany.
Their combined operations would employ more than 70,000 employees and carry
about 36m passengers a year, making it Europe's largest airline group.
The venture reflects the trend towards consolidation in the European airline
industry in response to greater liberalisation and globalisation of the
international airline market.
Pressure has mounted on the four medium-sized carriers to establish close
alliances to strengthen their competitive position as larger European rivals
expand their global reach through co-operation agreements and equity
investments in other carriers.
BA recently acquired a 24.6 per cent stake in USAir and a 25 per cent stake
in Qantas, the Australian carrier, while Lufthansa is negotiating a
co-operation agreement with American Airlines.
SAS said the four airlines wanted to establish 'a profitable, global
airline' with an integrated traffic system based on a multi-hub European
network, including Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Geneva, Oslo, Stockholm, Vienna
and Zurich.
The Scandinavian carrier said the proposal, which emerged after a two-month
study by 16 working groups set up by the four companies, would now be
considered by managements and owners of the four airlines.
The target was to sign a memorandum of understanding, setting out the
direction of co-operation, by late June and to establish a new management
company by next year.
The four airlines would initially retain their identities, although they
might also share a common branding. The head office of the new company would
be in Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Vienna or Zurich.
An SAS official said the proposal, though formally one of a number, was 'the
most feasible way forward'. But he said it would not necessarily lead to a
full merger.

SANDOZ, the Basle-based pharmaceutical and chemicals group, said sales in
the first quarter of 1993 were up 2.5 per cent to SFr4.21bn (Dollars
2.97bn).
Mr Marc Moret, chairman, said he was confident about the outlook for the
year, in spite of the unfavourable economic climate in Europe.
'I can already state that we will be able to look back on a good year. So
far, we are well within the framework of budgets set last September, and I
can see no reason for any change in the next few months,' Mr Moret said at
the group's annual press conference.
Mr Rolf Schweizer, vice-president, said all divisions except seeds achieved
sales gains in the first quarter, and the 1.4 per cent decline in seeds
sales was due to a disposal.
Mr Max Link, head of the group's pharmaceutical division, said first-quarter
sales in Germany and Italy had both fallen by more than 10 per cent as a
result of govern-ment-imposed price restrictions.
Sandoz executives were confident that they could overcome increasing
government pressure on drug prices in both the US and Europe with a steady
stream of new and innovative products.

FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Nortel sees US spending giving
lift to earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications equipment maker, is
banking on higher capital spending by US regional telephone companies and
continuing strong demand from the Far East and Latin America to reverse a 29
per cent slide in first-quarter earnings.
First-quarter earnings dipped to USDollars 75.9m, or 30 cents a common
share, from Dollars 104.2m, or 41 cents, a year earlier. Revenues edged up
to Dollars 1.94bn from Dollars 1.90bn.
Northern warned last month that its performance would be dented by sagging
sales of high-margin software. The company has also lifted outlays on
research and development, and spent heavily on a venture with Matra, the
French electronics group.
Mr Jean Monty, who took over as chief executive earlier this year from Dr
Paul Stern, declined to forecast 1993 earnings, beyond saying he expected
the second half to be stronger than the first.
He said growth in earnings needed to be balanced against other, longer-term
measures of performance, such as the need to maintain market share, customer
service and the launch of new products.
The US disappointed in the first quarter. Capital spending by regional phone
companies, Northern's biggest US customers, has stagnated. But Mr Monty said
growth in the number of lines connected to their networks pointed to higher
outlays later in the year.
Performance was also hurt by the weakness of sterling, which affected
dollar-denominated revenues from Europe.
Mr Monty said his priorities since taking over had included cost containment
and efforts to improve the effectiveness of Northern's R&amp;D effort.
He said Northern expected to announce a new wireless venture in the UK
within the next few days, although he declined to provide further details.

A further fall in performance-related incentive payments left Sir Ian
MacLaurin, chairman of Tesco, with emoluments for the year to February 27 of
Pounds 967,000.
This was the second year running that the chief of the UK supermarkets chain
suffered a reduction. Last time his total remuneration amounted to Pounds
1m, down from Pounds 1.48m in 1991.
The figure for 1992 has been restated from Pounds 1.08m to reflect a change
in accounting policy which relates the payment more closely to the results
on which they are based.
The 1992 annual report of Slough Estates reveals that Mr Graeme Elliot,
former vice chairman, received Pounds 429,000 in compensation for loss of

<TEXT>
CAIRN ENERGY, the oil exploration and production group which has made a
hostile Pounds 1.5m bid for Teredo Petroleum, the indebted oil company, has
hit out at the board for not recommending acceptance.
The all-share offer values Teredo at 4.8p a share. Cairn's share price has
increased by 20 per cent since it launched the bid following a gas discovery
in the US.
Mr Bill Gammell, chairman of Cairn, has asked shareholders in Teredo to
consider what plans its board has to secure the future of their company
beyond Friday, when interest repayments on Pounds 7.4m of debt fall due.
Shareholders should ask what plans the directors have for reducing a level
of gearing approaching 600 per cent, he said. Teredo, which has a majority
of small private investors, holds its annual meeting tomorrow.
The board has not recommended acceptance of the offer although it has
suggested shareholders strongly consider it. First day for acceptances is
today .

<TEXT>
BRYANT GROUP yesterday became the latest housebuilder to raise funds to buy
land in what increasingly looks like the beginning of a housing market
recovery.
It is raising about Pounds 18m from a placing of 13m shares at 137 1/2 p.
After the announcement the shares fell 2p to 142p. The placing is through SG
Warburg Securities.
Mr Colin Hope, chairman, said: 'The revival in new house purchasers'
confidence since the beginning of this year is extremely encouraging. Our
net reservations since December 1 are more than 30 per cent ahead of the
comparable period a year ago.'
The group, in addition to purchasing land in its existing areas, has formed
a subsidiary in Edinburgh and is in the process of establishing itself in
north-east England.

cash alternative of 73.33p per share. McKechnie is also offering 100p for
every Savage preference share.
The offer came as McKechnie announced that although first half pre-tax
profits for the six months to January 31 were fractionally higher at Pounds
10.8m, compared with Pounds 10.6m last time, there was an underlying
improvement in profits before interest of 7 per cent.
The bid was foreshadowed on April 22, when Savage announced it was in
discussions. Since then its share price has risen from 48p to 71p. The
McKechnie share offer, however, values each Savage share at 80p, or 67 per
cent more than its price before the bid talks announcement.
To meet demand for the cash alternative, Baring Brothers is underwriting the
issue of 8m new McKechnie shares at 385p.
McKechnie is paying Pounds 15.1m cash for the preference shares, a move
which is likely to lift gearing to about 20 per cent by the year-end from
10.4 per cent at the end of January.
Both groups stressed the neat fit of their respective businesses. The
acquisition will more than double the turnover of McKechnie's consumer
products division. Savage, whose core business is shelving and storage
systems, has been recovering from the damaging effects of continental
European acquisitions in the late 1980s. It made pre-tax profits of Pounds
1m on turnover of Pounds 32.3m in the six months to last December.
For McKechnie, the takeover of Savage represents the resumption of expansion
after concentration on reduction of its cost base and the maximisation of
cashflow.
In the latest half turnover was barely changed at Pounds 140.8m (Pounds
139.9m). Earnings per share rose from 9p to 9.5p, while the interim dividend
is maintained at 5p.
COMMENT
The full price McKechnie is paying for Savage suggests confidence on three
levels: recovery on the UK housing market, Savage's ability to generate
European sales in devalued pounds and its own ability to trim Savage's
costs. It will make little difference this financial year but could add over
Pounds 3m to McKechnie's bottom line in 1993-94 when the group should in any
case be recovering on the back of UK and US economic recovery. For the
immediate future, seasonal shifts in McKechnie's earnings mean that the
second half will be better than the first. That makes brokers' estimates of
1992-93 pre-tax profits over Pounds 26m look realistic. On earnings
approaching 20p, this puts the shares at yesterday's price of 423p on a
prospective multiple of over 21, recovery having been anticipated already.

Dakota, the Dublin-based packaging and stationery group, reported a recovery
in pre-tax profits from IPounds 144,000 to IPounds 1.36m (Pounds 1.33m) in
the six months to March 31.
Turnover on continuing activities edged ahead from IPounds 8.69m to IPounds

The results took in exceptional profits of IPounds 1.11m, reflecting a loss

FT  28 APR 93 / UK Company News: Bryant to raise Pounds 18m for land
purchases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRYANT GROUP yesterday became the latest housebuilder to raise funds to buy
land in what increasingly looks like the beginning of a housing market
recovery.
It is raising about Pounds 18m from a placing of 13m shares at 137 1/2 p.
Following the announcement the shares fell 2p to 142p.
The placing is through SG Warburg Securities. Dealings are expected to start
on Friday.
Mr Colin Hope, chairman, said: 'The revival in new house purchasers'
confidence since the beginning of this year is extremely encouraging. Our
net reservations since December 1 are more than 30 per cent ahead of the
comparable period a year ago.'
The group, in addition to purchasing land in its existing areas, has formed
a subsidiary in Edinburgh and is in the process of establishing itself in
north-east England.
A division has been set up to build smaller developments of luxury homes in
Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Warwickshire.
Earlier this year the group announced that first half pre-tax profits had
fallen from Pounds 9.8m to Pounds 7.5m. The interim dividend was held at
1.4p.
Borrowings of Pounds 9.3m at the half year represented gearing of just 5 per
cent. This excluded Pounds 20m associated company borrowings attributable to
Bryant.

<TEXT>
ACQUISITIONS pushed pre-tax profits strongly ahead for the second year
running at Waterford Foods, the Irish dairy group.
For 1992 profits rose 29 per cent, from IPounds 15.9m to IPounds 20.4m
(Pounds 20m).
Included was a five-month contribution from three dairy processing companies
of Express Foods Ireland, acquired last August from Grand Metropolitan for
IPounds 63m. Turnover moved up 30 per cent to IPounds 551.4m (IPounds
423.8m).
Mr Stephen O'Connor, managing director, described the result as the group's
'best year ever'. He said further profits growth was anticipated for 1993,
as a result of a full year's contribution from the Express acquisitions and
new investments made in plant which would bring improved margins.
Profit margin in 1992 improved to 5.3 per cent and that would further widen
'towards 10 per cent' as the group's focus shifted away from 'commodity
products to ones with greater value-added', he said.
Group borrowings more than doubled to IPounds 106m as a result of the
acquisitions. Gearing now stood at 78 per cent (56 per cent), although
interest cover remained at 3.3 times. Priorities for 1993 would be the
consolidation of the new businesses within the group and the use of cash
flow to improve gearing.
On a longer time-frame of three to four years, Mr O'Connor said the group
would continue to expand 'through organic growth and acquisition . . . there
is substantial scope to expand in the UK and the US'.
Earnings per share, before goodwill amortisation equal to 1.04p, rose 8 per
cent to 10.04p (9.27p).
The dividend is raised 4 per cent; a final of 1.58p makes a total of 2.73p
(2.625p) on increased capital.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EDINBURGH Investment Trust, the UK's second largest investment trust,
reported net asset value per share of 300.8p at March 31, a record year-end
level, against 253.9p a year earlier.
Net revenue was 13 per cent higher at Pounds 27.2m (Pounds 24.1m), for
earnings per share of 9.25p (8.19p).
The figures were helped by the move to increase investment in UK equities,
which at the end of the year accounted for 88.6 per cent of funds compared
with 62.1 per cent 12 months earlier. They were further boosted by the early
payment of dividends following tax changes announced in the 1993 Budget.
The final dividend is 5.55p, making a total of 8.4p (8.05p).
The managers entered into a loan agreement for Pounds 100m for one year,
ending in October 1993.

Howden Group, the Glasgow-based engineer, is to buy the fan and air handling
business of the Buffalo Forge Group for Dollars 34.3m (Pounds 21.8m).
This follows its recent acquisition of Novenco Industries, a Danish
manufacturer of industrial fans, for Pounds 22m. Howden raised Pounds 31.4m
to fund the purchase and to reduce bank borrowings.
Mr Konrad Johnsen, chief executive, said the merger of the Buffalo and
Novenco fan operations would reduce over-capacity in the market and give the
group a bigger share of the industry.
Payment for Buffalo is due at completion next month.

Pre-tax profits at Leeds Permanent Building Society fell 5.2 per cent, from
Pounds 95.1m to Pounds 90.2m, in the six months to March 31, after the
society doubled its charge for bad and doubtful debts to Pounds 84.1m,
against Pounds 40.8m, writes John Gapper.
Leeds Permanent, which declares half-year results because it has issued
permanent interest bearing shares, increased the value of its assets -
mainly mortgage loans - by 12.8 per cent to Pounds 19.4bn (Pounds 17.2bn).
The society achieved a 28 per cent rise in operating profits before bad
debts to Pounds 174.3m (Pounds 135.9m). However, its management expenses
rose by 18 per cent to Pounds 105.4m (Pounds 89.2m).

FT  28 APR 93 / UK Company News: Teredo board under fire from Cairn Energy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAIRN ENERGY, the oil exploration and production group which has made a
hostile Pounds 1.5m bid for Teredo Petroleum, the indebted oil company,
yesterday hit out at the board for not recommending acceptance.
Cairn's all-share offer currently values Teredo at 4.8p a share. Cairn's
share price has increased by 20 per cent since it launched the bid following
a gas discovery in the US.
Mr Bill Gammell, chairman of Cairn, has asked shareholders in Teredo to
consider what plans its board has to secure the future of their company
beyond Friday, when interest repayments on Pounds 7.4m of debt fall due.
Shareholders should ask what plans the directors have for reducing a level
of gearing approaching 600 per cent, he said. Teredo, which has a majority
of small private investors, holds its annual meeting tomorrow.
The board has not recommended acceptance of the offer although it has
suggested shareholders strongly consider it. First day for acceptances is
today .
Cairn said it is interested in taking over the company because of its
onshore oil production facilities which border those of Cairn.
The company has an option over Teredo's loan note of Pounds 1.4m.

FT  28 APR 93 / UK Company News: Preparing to rebuild on more substantial
foundations - The past and future strategies of Tarmac, which has incurred
the biggest loss recorded in the UK construction industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RISE and fall of Tarmac, Britain's biggest construction and building
materials group, is of epic proportions.
The company 14 years ago generated annual pre-tax profits of just Pounds
26.5m. A decade later, in 1988, it made a record Pounds 393m pre-tax.
Yesterday, it announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 350m, the biggest recorded
by a Britsh construction company.
The reasons for the jagged performance derive from Tarmac's strategy, led by
Sir Eric Pountain, then chairman and chief executive, of concentrating
investment in the 1980s in the vibrant UK and US economies.
Investment in continental Europe, favoured by UK building material rivals
like RMC, Redland and Steetley (now part of Redland), was largely ignored -
partly because Tarmac had burnt its fingers in Germany in the late 1970s.
'It was the reason I got the job of chief executive,' Sir Eric used to joke.
It left the group badly exposed when UK and US construction markets
collapsed in the late 1980s. Diversification into 'non-core' areas like
waste management proved no substitute for the kind of successful German
businesses which have buttressed results from Redland and RMC.
Tarmac's policy of allowing its operating divisions a high degree of
autonomy over investment decisions also meant that central management was
slow to reign back housing land purchases and investment in commercial
property joint ventures when property markets went into recession.
Group borrowings have risen steeply as property values have fallen.
Provisions last year against housing land and commercial property joint
ventures totalled almost Pounds 220m.
Mr Neville Simms, appointed chief executive 14 months ago and formerly head
of the contracting division, has been charged with restructuring the
business and repairing Tarmac's debt-laden balance sheet. Sir Eric remains
non-executive chairman.
At the end of last year net debt - including Tarmac's share of off-balance
sheet finance of Pounds 100m and Pounds 99.3m of auction market preferred
stock - stood at Pounds 677m. This was equivalent to 73 per cent of
shareholders' funds of Pounds 924m.
Tarmac aims to reduce debt by about Pounds 200m this year through disposals,
savings and by further squeezing working capital.
Mr Simms' strategy is to concentrate on the three core businesses of
housebuilding, construction and quarry products, continue to reduce
overheads where he can and reduce debts by selling peripheral operations,
such as Econowaste, the waste disposal business.
Most of the restructuring has been completed or already announced. A total
withdrawal from commercial property development should be completed within
two years. Capital employed in housebuilding this year is expected to
decline to an average of between Pounds 350m and Pounds 400m, representing
less than a quarter of total group capital employed in 1993.
This compares with peak housing expenditure of approaching Pounds 1bn in the
late 1980s accounting for more than half the group's capital employed.
On the building material front, dry stone manufacturing capacity has been
cut by 17 per cent; ready mixed concrete capacity by 15 per cent. Black top
manufacturing capacity has reduced by 5 per cent. Brick capacity has been
cut by 37 per cent, from 270m bricks a year to 170m. Concrete block plants
also have been closed reducing capacity by 15 per cent.
Last year Tarmac reduced the number of workers it employs by 4,300. A
further 900 jobs have gone in the first three months of this year.
In the US it intends to concentrate on the east coast where 'recovery
prospects' are greater. Non-core US businesses, some expensively acquired in
the 1980s, have been sold.
About Pounds 150m has been raised from disposals since last June. The group
hopes to raise a similar amount from sales this year. There has been
disappointment, however, at the time taken to find a buyer for Econowaste.
Mr Simms says there has been a marked change in management style, with much
greater central control over investment strategy, since his promotion.
It has been accompanied by what looks suspiciously like a palace revolution,
with Mr Bryan Baker, deputy chairman, Mr Anthony Collins, head of property,
Mr Jack Mawdsley, head of quarry products and Mr Derrick Sims, head of the
building materials division, retiring or leaving during the past year.
Mr Sam Pickstock, head of the housing division, has proved more permanent.
This has surprised some analysts who blame him for failing to keep a tighter
grip on the UK housing operations when the market turned down.
It has not prevented Tarmac's new chief executive from restructuring the
housebuilding business through the closure of four of the 20 operating units
in southern England and the Midlands with the loss of more than 250 jobs.
The aim is to take Pounds 100m of working capital out the business this year
reducing the number of homes sold in the UK from 8,000 to 7,000.
The timing of Mr Simms' appointment as chief executive has meant that the
work of curing the group's ills began somewhat later than in rival
companies.
The reaction from analysts yesterday was that Tarmac had still to complete
what others had already achieved. There was also some questioning whether it
was correct to be reducing capital employed in housing just as the market
seemed to be recovering.
SG Warburg, the group's broker, expressed it best: 'Although the jury
remains out, much of what Tarmac hopes to achieve in the 1990s and the
methods by which it will be achieved are already in place. However, to move
more positively as yet demands a degree of faith in management and growth
strategies and philosophies which has yet to be earned or established.'

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES OF Stagecoach, the bus and coach operator, closed on their first day
of trading at 124p, a 10 per cent premium on the offer price of 112p.
Mr Philip Stephens of UBS, the stockbrokers to the Perth-based company, said
that Stagecoach regarded the outcome as 'very satis-factory, suggesting that
we priced the issue right'.
Some 6m shares were sold in heavy trading. Nearly 12m shares had been sold
to the public and a further 22m placed with institutions.
Mr Stephens said that some small shareholders had been cashing in their
shares, with institutions buying and selling.
A stockbroker in Scotland, where interest in the issue was strong, said that
many people had been selling their shares because the allocations had been
so small. Most people received fewer than 250 shares in the public issue,
which was subscribed nearly eight times.

PRE-TAX profits at Herring Baker Harris, the chartered surveyor, slumped
from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 1.36m in the year to January 31.
As it forecast in January, the board is proposing a cut in the final
dividend to 0.5p (3.75p) giving a total for the year of 3.75p (7p). Earnings
per share fell to 3.97p (19.16p).
The shares lost 9p on the day to close at 62p.
The results included the first full-year contribution from Baker Harris
Saunders, the chartered surveyor which merged with the old Herring Son &amp; Daw
in early 1992. The 1992 comparative figures are for Herring Son &amp; Daw only.
Mr Nicholas Owen, chairman, said: 'The decline reflects some rationalisation
following the merger but it was the setback in property values and markets
that hit us.' He warned that trading in the current year remained difficult.
Turnover rose 44 per cent to Pounds 19.4m (Pounds 13.5m) but fell 9.6 per
cent from the 1992 turnover of both companies combined.
At the year-end the company had net debt of Pounds 999,000 for gearing of 25
per cent, against cash of Pounds 3.81m. Net interest paid was Pounds 24,000
against net interest received of Pounds 167,000. It had a cash outflow
during the year of Pounds 4.8m, of which about Pounds 3.5m was
merger-related.
Operating costs rose to Pounds 18m (Pounds 10.1m) of which Pounds 10.9m were
staff costs, including redundancies. In the UK costs were cut by 7 per cent
overall.
The group is reaping benefits from the merger with, for example, a shift in
the relative contribution of the six divisions.
The professional division contributed 18.3 per cent of turnover (31.4 per
cent) and the agency division 26.7 per cent (14.5 per cent).
CPC Baker Harris, the US property consultancy, suffered a loss and required
a cash injection. Most of the Los Angeles office is being sold to Mr
Nicholas Costa, the American company's former president.

FT  28 APR 93 / UK Company News: John Cahill receives his Dollars 800,000
salary in US
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR JOHN CAHILL, chairman of British Aerospace, receives his Dollars 800,000
(Pounds 520,000) salary in the US, despite being head of one of the UK's
largest manufacturing companies.
A resident of Long Bay Key, Florida, for tax purposes, Mr Cahill joined BAe
when the group was looking for a 'British' replacement for Prof Sir Roland
Smith, who was ousted in a boardroom coup in 1991.
Mr Cahill, the former chief executive of BTR, the industrial holding
company, is also due to receive stock options to buy shares valued 'in or
around' September 1992 at about Dollars 3.2m.
According to his service contract, Mr Cahill is required to work an average
of four days a week but has 'no established work schedule' and can 'perform
his services at times and places reasonably and in good faith selected by
him'.
The company also pays for legal, tax, accounting financial and estate
planning counselling.
Mr Cahill's service contract was available for public scrutiny in the run up
to yesterday's annual meeting.

FT  28 APR 93 / UK Company News: NatWest chief warns of subdued loan demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCOPE for growth in National Westminster Bank's income may be inhibited
'for some time' because of subdued loan demand, Lord Alexander, chairman,
told the annual meeting in London yesterday.
He said the first few months of 1993 indicated that 'we are over the worst
so far as UK bad debts are concerned', but that subdued loan demand 'may
well continue for some time, and inhibit the scope for income growth'.
However, Lord Alexander said that NatWest Markets, the recently restructured
corporate and investment banking arm, was among parts of the group where
income was growing.
NatWest Markets contributed Pounds 252m to group pre-tax profits of Pounds
405m. The previous year, the businesses within it contributed Pounds 315m
profit, while the total pre-tax profit was only Pounds 110m.
The unchanged dividend for 1992 reflected 'a degree of caution about the
pace of economic recovery', but the bank looked forward to the time when it
could provide shareholders with real dividend growth, the chairman added.
Directors faced criticism from some shareholders for the rise in their
remuneration last year despite the dividend being held. However, Lord
Alexander said that directors had managed to raise profitability.

FT  28 APR 93 / UK Company News: German stake in Young Grp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOUNG GROUP, the County Durham-based opencast and drift coal miner,
announced yesterday that MG Carbon, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Frankfurt-based Metallgesellschaft, had acquired a 29.5 per cent stake.
The deal, which gives MG Carbon a seat on the Young board, stemmed from a
decision by the company's directors and leading shareholders to increase the
financial strength of the company, which has been restructured following
serious working capital problems.
Mr Brian Calver, Young's chief executive and group managing director,
refused to be drawn on whether Metallgesellschaft's involvement meant the
group would now bid, with German backing, for any of the 20 British Coal
mines being offered to the private sector, but he confirmed: 'It increases
the likelihood of Young Group taking a much more positive role in the coal
industry.'
Young last week announced a loss for the year to November 30 of Pounds 7.9m.

FT  28 APR 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Sage grow 24%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAGE GROUP, the Newcastle-based accounting software company, maintained its
growth record in the six months to March 31, with a 24 per cent improvement
in pre-tax profits and 45 per cent rise in turnover.
Sage acquired three companies during the period, Ciel in France, Remote
Control International in the US and Yorkshire Business Forms, which
contributed Pounds 5.51m to total turnover of Pounds 21m (Pounds 14.5m).
Underlying growth was a healthy 11 per cent during the worst recession the
software industry has known.
Profits before tax came to Pounds 5.38m (Pounds 4.34m). Earnings per share
were 17.68p (14.53p) and an interim dividend of 3.32p (3.02p) is declared.
Net cash balances at March 31 were Pounds 3m after the company spent Pounds
5.1m on acquisitions.
Remote Control International incurred a loss of Pounds 370,000 as a result
of management and product changes. Mr David Goldman, chairman, said the loss
had been expected and budgeted for.

FT  28 APR 93 / UK Company News: BAe expects recovery in 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE, which reported a Pounds 201m pre-tax loss last year
before a Pounds 1bn exceptional restructuring charge, would show solid
recovery in 1994, Mr John Cahill, chairman, told the annual meeting.
He said cash outflows this year associated with the 20 per cent stake in
Airbus, regional aircraft rationalisation costs and investment in Tornado
fighter aircraft production were expected to be reversed next year.
Although the company still had to address the difficulties in its
turbopropeller aircraft business, Mr Cahill expressed optimism over the
future.
This optimism has been reflected in recent weeks by the sharp improvement in
the share price, which has recovered from a low of 98p last year to more
than 320p.
Mr Cahill said there had been an improvement in the medium-term outlook for
defence profits following additional Tornado orders from Saudi Arabia and
continued demand for Hawk and Harrier aircraft.
Although the European Fighter Aircraft programme, now renamed Eurofighter
2000, continued to face pressures and uncertainty, Mr Cahill said he was
confident that development would be completed to enable deliveries of the
new fighter to start at the end of the century.
'Eurofighter will be vital to our performance into the next century,' he
said, emphasising that the programme's long-term importance for the UK
aerospace industry could not be overstated.
Mr Cahill was also optimistic over the Rover car subsidiary's prospects.
Although the UK upturn was partially offset by big falls in car demand in
other European markets, Mr Cahill said the combination of favourable
exchange rates, cost reductions and development of a strong product range
would enable Rover to move through its break-even point this year.
He thus confirmed the earlier forecast that Rover would be profitable this
year after two years of losses.
Mr Cahill said the European Airbus would continue to consume cash this year,
largely because of the introduction of the new A330/A340 wide-body
airliners.
He was confident, however, that Airbus would become a significant cash
contributor to BAe in the longer term.

FT  28 APR 93 / UK Company News: Travis Perkins falls 21% after lower
property sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAVIS PERKINS, the timber and building materials merchant, yesterday
reported higher 1992 trading profits and said sales and profits were ahead
in the first quarter of this year.
However, reduced profits of Pounds 1.64m (Pounds 5.84m) on the sale of
surplus property, meant that pre-tax profits dropped 21 per cent, from
Pounds 14m to Pounds 11m, and earnings per share fell 29 per cent to 7.7p
(10.8p).
Despite this, the final dividend is again 5.5p, maintaining the total, which
is not fully covered, at 8p.
Trading profits at the group, which operates 165 building materials depots
and 11 garden centres, increased 6 per cent to Pounds 9.63m despite a 2 per
cent decline in turnover to Pounds 303.4m.
The average number of employees in the group was reduced by 12.6 per cent to
3,219 with output per employee improving by 11.9 per cent.
The bad debt charge improved slightly to 1.2 per cent of credit sales from
1.4 per cent the previous year - the first improvement for four years.
Net interest payments declined to Pounds 242,000 (Pounds 357,000) mainly
reflecting reduced borrowings which fell to Pounds 1m (Pounds 7.8m) at the
end of December, but the pre-tax profit figure was overshadowed by the
year-on-year drop in proceeds from property sales.
Mr Tony Travis, chairman, said the current year had started 'with more
promise' and sales were up about 2 per cent in volume terms and about 4 per
cent in value.
COMMENT
Travis' chairman acknowledges that the time taken integrating Travis Arnold
and Sandell Perkins following their merger in 1988 probably means it has
been 'missing the boat' in terms of other acquisitions which might have
provided it with a short cut to becoming a truly national builders
merchants' group. Nevertheless, the group, which has about 4 per cent of the
domestic market, is still looking for smaller deals. Even without
substantialy higher profits on property disposals, the group should benefit
from the economic upturn. Some 70 per cent of its sales relate to the
replacement, repair and improvement market and with business prospects
improving there should be be no more redundancy costs. Pre-tax profits of
Pounds 14m look possible this year producing earnings of 9.5p. The stock -
which gained 13p yesterday to 218p producing a prospective p/e of 23 - could
still go higher.

<TEXT>
Sir Anthony Tennant, who retired as chairman of Guinness at the end of last
year, has been retained as a consultant to the drinks group for the next two
years at an annual fee of Pounds 50,000.
The annual report, published yesterday, shows that Sir Anthony was given a
pay rise of 24 per cent in his final year, increasing his remuneration from
Pounds 625,000 to Pounds 777,000.
However, Sir Anthony, who was paid a performance-related bonus of Pounds
156,000 in 1991, received no bonus last year as the group's profits slipped
12 per cent to Pounds 795m.

FT  28 APR 93 / Tarmac losses reach Pounds 1m a working day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TARMAC, Britain's biggest building materials and construction group, lost
more than Pounds 1m each working day last year.
The company yesterday said it incurred a Pounds 350.3m pre-tax loss in 1992,
the largest ever by a British construction company. It compared with a
Pounds 21m pre-tax profit the previous year.
The loss was struck after provisions of Pounds 372m. Of this Pounds 217m was
against housing and commercial property operations. Tarmac said it will
withdraw totally from speculative property development in the next two
years.
It plans to reduce the number of homes built in the UK this year from 8,266
to between 7000 and 7,500 - reducing capital employed in housing by a
further Pounds 100m. Five years ago it built more than 11,000 homes
annually.
Provisions last year included Pounds 64.3m for reorganisation costs as the
group has cut the size of its business in a bid to reduce large borrowings.
The group had cut almost 10,000 jobs during the past two years leaving it
with a labour force of 25,000. The company's capacity to produce drystone,
concrete blocks, ready-mix concrete, bricks and black top for road building
and repairs had been cut by between 5 per cent and 36 per cent.
The group proposed to maintain its interim dividend at 2.5p making a
same-again total for the year of 5.5p. There was a loss per share of 37.6p,
against earnings last time of 0.2p. Tarmac shares rose 8p to close at 141p.
Two divisions out of six incurred a loss last year. The others reported
lower operating profits. US operations incurred a loss of Dollars 6m (Pounds
3.8m) (compared with an Dollars 11.8m loss in 1991); building materials a
loss of Pounds 2.9m (1991 profit Pounds 1.4m). Housebuilding profits before
interest and exceptional items fell from Pounds 56.4m to Pounds 38.6m;
contracting profits fell from Pounds 39.7m to Pounds 22.7m; quarry products
fell from Pounds 42.8m to Pounds 29.6m; industrial products profits dropped
from Pounds 12.5m to Pounds 4.8m.
The group said net debt, excluding off- balance sheet and auction market
preferred stock would have fallen Pounds 58m but for sterling's collapse,
which added more than Pounds 100m to its mostly US dollar denominated debt.

FT  28 APR 93 / Hoechst down 28% in quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE accelerating slump in western Europe, especially in Germany, cut profits
at Hoechst by 28 per cent in the first three months of this year, the
company reported yesterday.
Germany's biggest chemicals concern said in an interim report that pre-tax
earnings had fallen to DM436m (Pounds 177m), compared with DM605m, on sales
5 per cent lower at DM11bn.
Profits at the parent company tumbled 35 per cent to DM219m, and turnover
fell 13 per cent to DM3.7bn during the quarter under review. Group pre-tax
earnings for the whole of 1992 fell 18 per cent.
There was still no sign of an upturn in Europe, which accounts for more than
half group turnover, although business had picked up slightly in north
America despite pronounced weakness in pharmaceuticals sales caused by
retailers stocking up at the end of last year before the imposition of price
increases, the interim report said.
The group's drugs and healthcare business, which yields almost a quarter of
total turnover, had also suffered from the effects of healthcare reforms in
Germany, Mr Wolfgang Hilger, chairman, told the annual meeting yesterday.
According to the interim report, domestic drugs sales were 10 per cent lower
in the period under review, although total turnover from healthcare was down
less than 2 per cent at DM2.6bn.
The biggest single drop in sales - 12 per cent - was recorded in the
polymers business, within which bulk plastics suffered a fall of 20 per
cent.
Mr Hilger attributed the 5 per cent fall in group sales to a 3 per cent drop
in volume and a 1 per cent reduction in prices, while the effects of
exchange rate changes had cost the group a further 1 per cent.
Mr Hilger told the annual meeting that shortages of personnel, systems or
technical facilities were not to blame for the recent series of 15 accidents
in which one man was killed.
He blamed 'fate' for the 'statistical frequency', and pointed out that the
last accidental death in the German parent's plant occurred 15 years ago.
'On a statistical basis, a job in our factories is considerably safer than
one in retailing,' he said.

FT  28 APR 93 / BT redundancy programme wiped out big pension surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecom's redundancy programme, under which it shed 29,000 workers
last year, has effectively wiped out a Pounds 913m surplus in its pension
scheme, forcing the company to resume contributions from April 1, 1993.
The British Telecom Staff Superannuation Scheme report and accounts for the
nine months to December 1992 shows that the effects of the redundancy scheme
reduced the surplus to Pounds 119m by March 1993. The scheme has received
advice from its actuaries that the level of surplus is too low to sustain
further contributions holidays, according to the annual report.
Employees have not had a pensions holiday, and have been contributing 6 per
cent of their pay.
BT, which has not had to make contributions to its pension scheme since
1988, is required under scheme rules to contribute 9 per cent of its
employees' wages to the scheme when it does not have a surplus. A company
spokesman said that the 1992 wages bill was Pounds 3.963bn, which equates to
an annual contribution of roughly Pounds 357m.
However, he said the resumption of contributions will have an
'insignificant' effect on BT's profits, which were Pounds 3.07bn pre-tax in
the year to March, 1992.
The elimination of the pension scheme surplus means that BT will also have
to finance future redundancy costs out of its own profit and loss account.
BT has said it plans to shed about 15,000 workers in the current year and
15,000 next year.
The redundancy programme has also changed the demographic profile of the
scheme, increasing the number of pensioners by nearly 10 per cent to 149,179
and cutting contributors by nearly 20 per cent to 113,186. This increases
current liabilities and cuts cash flow.
As a result of the redundancy programmes and the uncertainties created by
the demographic shift, the trustees have taken the unusual step of
requesting that annual actuarial valuations be performed over the next few
years to ensure that the scheme is not falling into deficit. Typically,
valuations are performed only once every three years.
The annual report noted that relative to other large pension schemes, the
fund managers underperformed in 1992, largely reflecting the scheme's heavy
weighting in property.

FT  28 APR 93 / Sears up 2.8% in wake of shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEARS, the retail group, is beginning to reap the benefits of its
restructuring, Mr Liam Strong, chief executive since February last year,
said yesterday.
The group, whose retail brands include Selfridges, Wallis, Adams, Olympus
and Freemans, recorded a 2.8 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds
83.5m in the year to January 31, after exceptional costs of Pounds 31.5m,
down from Pounds 32.5m.
However, there were extraordinary charges of Pounds 112m, compared with
Pounds 11.2m, and on an FRS 3 basis Sears incurred a Pounds 47.8m loss,
against a restated Pounds 22.8m profit.
Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, chairman, said the group could see some signs of
improvement in trading but that economic recovery was likely to be slow.
Mr Strong said the group had largely completed the restructuring phase and
had taken encouraging steps towards putting the group's costs on a sensible
basis. Now the group had to get the shops and products in tune with what
customers wanted.
He said the balance sheet had been strengthened, with net debt cut over the
year from Pounds 153m to Pounds 47m through disposals and tighter cash
management. However, Sears aimed to step up capital expenditure from Pounds
40m last year to Pounds 70m. A property revaluation cut values by Pounds
75m.
Sales were unchanged at Pounds 1.98bn, but trading profits from continuing
businesses rose from Pounds 95.9m to Pounds 107.2m. Profits from footwear
retailing jumped from Pounds 9.3m to Pounds 23.3m as comparable store sales
grew 6 per cent, which Mr Strong put down to better product design and
sourcing, and costs were cut. The charge largely relates to footwear
business restructuring.
Speciality retailing profits rose from Pounds 25.6m to Pounds 26.9m, with
women's and children's wear strong but the Olympus sports chain incurring a
loss. Selfridges, the department store, made Pounds 16.9m, up from Pounds
16.2m.
The home shopping side suffered a drop from Pounds 29.9m to Pounds 23.2m,
although Freemans profits were up. The Dutch business acquired early last
year incurred a loss of Pounds 6.7m. Property made Pounds 22.1m, up from
Pounds 19.6m.
Earnings per share were unchanged at 4.2p, and the final dividend is 2.5p,
down from 3.83p, as forecast, to give a total of 3.5p against 5.355p.

FT  28 APR 93 / Gas companies break their traditional mould: Rapid growth
opportunities in the global energy market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS engineers from Liverpool lay pipes to connect the sleepy town of
Kelbra in the foothills of the Harz mountains to the east German gas grid
using technology developed in the UK. Enron, the US gas transit company,
unveils one of the world's largest gas-fired combined heat and power
stations on Teesside in the UK at a total cost of Pounds 895m.
Both projects are evidence of the growing trend among gas companies to break
out of the traditional confines of their domestic markets and extend their
global reach. 'We are moving into a new era of gas and you will see the
growth of the gas majors in a similar way to the development of the oil
industry in the 1950s,' said Mr Ken Lay, chairman of Enron.
Mr Lay has ambitious plans for Enron to be one of the first truly global gas
companies, but he faces intense competition from British Gas and other
European energy companies such as Spain's Gas Natural and Belgium's
Tractebel.
But Mr Jonathan Stern, analyst at Gas Strategies, a consulting group,
believes that since the gas business is so capital intensive, companies will
be financially constrained from developing a worldwide network in the way
the oil industry has done.
'It will become a regional business and is already becoming dominated by
about 20 companies with strong local bases which are expanding into specific
markets overseas,' he said.
Gas Natural, for example, is looking to expand into overseas
Spanish-speaking markets and focusing on opportunities created by the wave
of privatisation in South America.
Gas companies' global ambitions rest on the back of a growing trend towards
de-regulation and privatisation in the world energy business, accompanied by
expectations of huge growth in gas demand over the next 20 years.
'The worldwide gas market is expanding fast and it offers a unique
opportunity for huge growth to some of the companies that are getting
involved now,' said Mr Simon Blakey, gas analyst at Cambridge Energy
Research Associates.
Gas is becoming more attractive as an alternative to coal and oil because of
its environmental advantages - it is much cleaner to burn - and its price is
competitive. In a cautious estimate for the growth in global gas demand by
2010, Royal Dutch/Shell group puts consumption at 2,500bn cubic metres from
the current level of 2,000bn cubic metres.
The rapid growth in gas demand poses a huge challenge for the energy
industry. In a recent speech, Mr Roland Williams, gas and coal co-ordinator
for the Shell group, estimated that the cost of finding, producing and
transporting new gas to the main markets over the next 20 years will be
between Dollars 800bn (Pounds 519bn) and Dollars 1,100bn.
The oil companies have so far stuck mainly to gas exploration and
production, resisting involvement in distribution or power generation, which
could prove the more lucrative market sectors. Gas is not a globally-traded
commodity in the way oil is, and gas companies will have to develop the
expertise to operate differently in different parts of the world. Gas
distribution is an area where companies such as British Gas, which has
rapidly developed its own domestic markets, can offer technology and
know-how with the financial muscle to invest in developing transit networks.
'We have expertise in all parts of the gas chain and we want to grow in all
directions, but our real knowledge is in developing gas markets,' said Mr
Russell Herbert, director of British Gas's Global Gas business.
This has seen British Gas tapping into potentially lucrative markets
overseas. The company is active in 45 countries. But competition is intense
 -European gas companies fear their market monopolies may be broken up by
the EC and many are looking to diversify overseas.
These new markets offer great growth potential, but bring with them a bigger
risk of regulatory interference than exists in gas exploration and
production. Countries privatising their utilities have often looked to the
UK for a model and here, British Gas has suffered at the hands of the
regulator. However, established gas companies such as British Gas, Gaz de
France and Ruhrgas have great marketing expertise they can offer countries
developing their gas businesses. Technology usually means they can offer
cost savings in running a market and they also have the cash to invest in
large scale projects.
Gas distribution companies are also moving into oil exploration. British Gas
is currently involved in negotiations to develop the giant Karachaganak
field in Kazakhstan, which would double its existing gas reserves.
Germany's two main gas companies, Ruhrgas and Wintershall, are looking to
buy into exploration acreage in the North Sea.
British Gas's need to expand is driven by more pressing concerns: its UK
market is being actively eroded by regulators and government. The company is
under investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which could
lead to substantial changes in its UK business. The UK regulator has already
warned the company that it will not be able to finance expansion overseas by
raising prices in the UK.
The next 10 years, however, should see the transformation of the gas
business from the current domestically-focused supply chains into a much
more global industry.

FT  28 APR 93 / Russia 'faces collapse' without rapid reforms: West and
Moscow officials warn of financial failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA FACES financial collapse and risks a social explosion if President
Boris Yeltsin fails to put radical economic reforms into place immediately,
western economists and Russian officials warned yesterday.
The dominant fear in Moscow is that between now and elections, which might
be held this autumn, the pre-referendum ploy of keeping voters happy by
delaying harsh reform measures and issuing boundless credits to avoid
bankruptcies would continue.
Mr Sergei Shakhrai, deputy prime minister for nationalities and an important
aide to Mr Yeltsin, said that without decisive action, 'the rouble will
disappear by the autumn' as more people lose confidence in it.
Mr Sergei Vassiliev, head of the government's Centre for Economic Reform,
said there were 'strong political imperatives now for delay in reforms. Mr
Yeltsin should right now implement tough policies, but he won't'. He said
the government was not in control and he expected 'there could be
hyperinflation by the autumn. People don't understand what hyperinflation
means, and so we will have to live through one before we get stabilisation'.
The government meets tomorrow and is likely to try to approve the economic
measures, including a control on credits, delayed by the referendum
campaign.
Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, a prominent economist and a candidate for the
presidency, believes the government also represents 'an enormous compromise
with conservative forces, which means that it is no longer able to control
inflation, but is simply a forum for the political struggle'.
Since Mr Yeltsin has constructed a compromise cabinet to placate the centre
ground whose support he needs, he will not disturb the balance before new
elections - although Mr Shakhrai said there would be a 'reshuffle of posts'
in the next few days.
Within this cabinet, the radical ministers known to the west are a small and
embattled minority. Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister in charge of
finance, has said that of the 117 people of ministerial rank in the
government, only four understood the market system: Mr Anatoly Chubais,
deputy premier for privatisation; Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy premier for
foreign economic affairs; Mr Shakhrai and himself.
The latest Yeltsin appointment was Mr Oleg Lobov, an old ally of the
president but deeply sceptical of radical reform. He is now first deputy
prime minister in charge of the economy - vying with the other first deputy,
Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, and outranking Mr Fyodorov at the finance ministry.
This issue is expected to be the subject of heated debate at the cabinet
meeting tomorrow.
Mr Vassiliev said even the radical ministers had not been able to get a
strong grip on credit expansion. That would lead, he said, to a reversal in
the recent fall in inflation from 27 per cent a month in January to about 15
per cent last month. Independent figures show there is likely to be a rise
to 20 per cent or more this month and more in May, as raised pensions make
an impact.

FT  28 APR 93 / Boarding school enrolment falls by 6% as fees rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of boarders in the UK's independent schools fell by 6 per cent
last year, the steepest decline since records began in 1982, according to
the Independent School Information Service.
This comes on top of a 10 per cent fall in the number of boarders over the
previous three years, and accelerates the decline in this sector of
independent education, according to the ISIS census, which accounts for
about 80 per cent of independent school pupils.
Term fees averaged Pounds 3,125 for boarders, a rise of 8 per cent. Overall,
independent school fees rose on average by 8.3 per cent - over three times
the rate of inflation and almost double the rate of increase in average
earnings.
The sharpest falls in numbers came at the preparatory level, with the number
of eight-year-olds falling by 16.9 per cent, and the number of nine-year-old
boarders falling by 15.1 per cent.
Mr David Woodhead, director of ISIS, said: 'We've had a long-term gradual
decline in the number of boarders in our schools and this shows the extent
to which the recession has hastened that decline.'
However, numbers at day schools, where term fees average Pounds 1,368, were
resilient, with day boys dropping by 0.5 per cent, and the number of day
girls increasing marginally, by 0.1 per cent.
This resulted in a total drop in the independent school population of 1.5
per cent - the second annual fall in succession, following nine years of
steady growth.
New spending on buildings and equipment per pupil fell by 10 per cent to
Pounds 513 as schools tried to minimise fee rises.
More than a quarter of pupils are receiving financial help, the highest
figure recorded. Schools provided scholarships or bursaries to 16.9 per cent
of pupils - more than double the rate in 1982. Take-up of the government
assisted-places scheme for pupils from low-income families rose by 3.4 per
cent.
ISIS defended the increase in fees, pointing to the cut in spending on
building and equipment, and the rise in teachers' pay in the public sector,
which it put at 9.5 per cent for 1992. Mr Woodhead said: 'Local authority
spending on education in 1992-93 is allowed by central government to rise by
7.1 per cent - more than three times the current inflation rate.'
Mr Michael Oakley, secretary of the Girls' Public Day School Trust, also
defended the fee increases.
He said: 'Our forecast is that fee increases next September will be in the
range of 4 to 5 per cent which is roughly in line with the predicted
underlying rate of inflation. Education is very labour-intensive and
anything up to 80 per cent of our costs are related to staff salaries. We've
got to keep our salary scales at least at that which is on offer in the
maintained sector.'

FT  28 APR 93 / Jardine ousted from HK trade association
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MILESTONE in Hong Kong's return to China was passed last night when
Jardine Matheson, the British trading company, was thrown off the board of
Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce.
Ballot victories by pro-Beijing businessmen left the board evenly split
between supporters and opponents of Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor.
Mr Martin Barrow, a senior executive of Jardine Pacific, Jardine's core
trading, distribution and construction arm, stood for re-election and was
defeated in a battle organised in part by the Xinhua news agency, Beijing's
unofficial embassy in Hong Kong.
This is the first time since the chamber, the colony's leading business
association, was founded in 1861 that a representative of Jardine has not
sat on the board.
Beijing has gained control of Hong Kong's other main business associations.
But the chamber has so far refused to come out against Mr Patten and has
withdrawn its support from the Business and Professionals Federation, which
in November made a strong attack on the governor.
Six seats on the 24-member board, vacated by rotation, were contested in a
secret ballot. Five pro-Beijing businessmen were elected while one
incumbent, Mr Simon Lee, was re-elected.
Among the successful candidates were Mr Chan Wing Kee, a textile
manufacturer who is also a Hong Kong deputy to the National People's
Congress, China's rubber-stamp parliament, and Mr Ye Longfei, a Shanghai
government official.
The campaign Beijing mounted reflects the seriousness with which China takes
the Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's lawmaking body. The chamber
elects one of the 60 members of LegCo, a position held by Mr Jimmy McGregor,
an outspoken Patten supporter.

FT  28 APR 93 / DTI may exempt small businesses from annual audit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 250,000 small companies could be exempted from the statutory
annual audit as early as next year, under Department of Trade and Industry
proposals issued yesterday.
The move would represent one of the most sweeping changes for nearly a
century to legislation covering the scope of audit requirements.
In a consultative document launched by Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for
corporate affairs, the DTI suggests exempting from annual audit limited
liability companies with a turnover below Pounds 37,600, the threshold for
value added tax registration.
'It is absurd that small companies should be required to spend scarce
resources on something of no benefit to their business,' Mr Hamilton said.
'This is a measure which has considerable deregulatory potential for almost
no risk.'
While proposals for abolition of the small company audit have already been
examined and rejected by the government twice in the past decade, most of
the more influential decision-makers have now changed their views and
endorse relaxation.
The Inland Revenue, which has traditionally opposed the change, said
yesterday it had been fully consulted: 'The chancellor is fully signed up to
reducing the burdens on small business.'
Mr Paul Chisnall, an associate director of the British Bankers' Association,
said: 'We can see the need to try to lift the requirement. This proposal is
moving with the times. We welcome it.'
But Mr Terry Robinson, a vice-president of the Institute of Credit
Management, said credit-rating agencies would resist the changes, which
would reduce the reliability of published financial information. 'This will
work against the best interests of small companies,' he said.
The DTI document proposes two options: exemption from the audit requirement;
or replacement of the audit with a 'compilation report' from an accountant
confirming the accounts have been prepared in accordance with company law.
Exemption would also require unanimous approval by shareholders and the
company should have balance sheet assets of not more than Pounds 100,000.
That could cover an estimated 250,000-300,000 companies, which research has
suggested spend 2 to 4.5 per cent of turnover on an audit fee which many
regard as having little practical value.
Consultation closes at the end of June. Mr Hamilton said that, if approved,
the changes could be brought about by regulation, and be introduced possibly
as soon as spring or summer next year.
Mr Tony Miller, an accountant who is financial affairs chairman for the
National Federation of Self Employed and Small Businesses, called for the
threshold for exemption to be lifted further. 'This is a step in the right
direction but it is still far too restrictive,' he said.

FT  28 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even Goofy could see that Euro Disney needs more funding. Over the full year
to the end of March, its cash outflow from operations amounted to FFr600m,
before the capital spending required to keep the Magic Kingdom in shape.
With FFr20bn of debt outstanding Euro Disney cannot easily go back to the
banks for more. Additional guarantees from Fairy Godmother, in the form of
Walt Disney, might help. But Euro Disney already has shareholder approval
for up to FFr5bn of convertible or warrant bonds, so an equity-related issue
cannot be ruled out. The 4 per cent fall in the shares yesterday shows
investors do not relish the prospect.
Funding for the second phase of the project - due to open in 1996 and likely
to cost FFr9bn - has not even been addressed. There must be a temptation to
put expansion plans on ice until the first phase is profitable. But
yesterday's results suggest Euro Disney would benefit from a grander scale.
While the number of visitors during the winter was encouraging, tourists are
spending too little and hotel occupancy was low. A bigger theme park would
help spread fixed costs and encourage overnight stays.
While the existing business is losing money, though, Euro Disney will have
its work cut out persuading investors to suspend their disbelief. With
recession looming in Germany and France - and devaluations discouraging
visitors from the UK, Italy and Spain - simply keeping the turnstiles
turning will be challenging enough.

FT  28 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Sears
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sears, it seems, cannot kick its addiction to extraordinary items. Unlike
Tarmac and its torrent of red ink, Sears has not yet summoned the will to
embrace fully Professor Tweedie's reforms. As well as taking losses below
the line Sears showed a Pounds 14.6m profit on property disposals which
would have been a loss of Pounds 5.2m on the new basis. Some Pounds 4.8m of
provisions against the housebuilding business were also released - reducing
the interest line - while a further Pounds 28m of extraordinary costs were
taken against its closure. This effectively increases reported profits by
almost Pounds 5m and is disappointing in a company which argues that old
habits are on the way out. About the best that can be said is that 1991-92
was worse, with larger property gains and interest reductions.
Tricks of the accounting light to one side, the new management is making
some progress with operations. British Shoe has perked up as better
retailing discipline is applied to stocks, product ranges and relationships
with suppliers. There is more margin improvement to come and a revamp of the
well-worn shoe shops is promised for 1994.
Yet there were setbacks elsewhere. The newly-acquired Dutch mail order
business made a loss, as did Olympus. Shoes and womenswear are doing well
from the upturn, but mail order, sportswear and Adams children's clothes are
struggling in tough markets. Those holding on for the recovery must hope
that Sears' reputation for being asset-rich but accident-prone goes the way
of extraordinary losses.

FT  28 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Tarmac
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the space of five years, Tarmac has swung from a restated pre-tax profit
of more than Pounds 400m into a Pounds 350m loss. Battered shareholders must
be hoping for an equally drastic reversal of misfortune as recovery takes
hold. But despite the cyclical nature of its markets, Tarmac will find it
far harder climbing back up the cliff than falling off it.
The trouble is that Tarmac's balance sheet is still out of kilter with the
state of its market. After exhibiting an unhappy knack of sinking money into
falling markets a few years ago, Tarmac is now applying the reverse skill of
withdrawing working capital from the rising housebuilding market. This lack
of aggression partly reflects Tarmac's commendable determination to ensure
growth is sustainable this time round, but it also stems from continuing
financial constraints. Despite a Pounds 147m disposal programme, Tarmac
ended the year with Pounds 577.1m of debt. Cash will remain frightfully
tight even though another Pounds 150m should be realised from disposals this
year.
Tarmac is probably right to believe that its steady restructuring progress
will bear fruit in the medium term. That, though, hardly represents a
ringing reason to buy the shares at present, especially given the dull
outlook for its quarry and contracting businesses. Short term attention is
likely to focus on nimbler housebuilders. Significantly, Bryant Group became
just the latest of these to tap the stock market yesterday for expansion
funds.

FT  28 APR 93 / The Lex Column: A measure of confidence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
To some extent economic recovery was always a matter of confidence. The
latest CBI survey suggests the trick might be working. The leap in business
optimism was the greatest for a decade. Not surprisingly that translates
into expectations of increased orders and output over the next four months.
One has to assume that these hopes will be - more or less - fulfilled. With
the government busy talking the economy up ahead of the Newbury by-election,
though, it is all the more necessary to guard against overlooking the
weaknesses that are also apparent from the survey.
There is no sign of restocking, while the balance of respondents reported
that domestic deliveries actually fell in the first four months of the year.
One would not expect a rush to invest when 63 per cent of manufacturers are
still working below capacity. That more companies expect to cut rather than
increase capital spending is also food for thought, given the temporary
capital allowances introduced in last year's autumn statement and the
cash-flow benefits many can expect from the changes to the ACT rules.
That leaves a recovery dependent on consumer demand and exports, backed up
admittedly by some striking improvements in productivity. The question is
whether these will be enough to secure UK competitiveness if sterling
continues to rise and continental demand falls. The CBI thinks exports would
start to suffer if sterling rose much above DM2.60. Then the government
would face a dilemma. It has come out against further cuts in interest
rates, but intervention to hold sterling down would simply aggravate the
PSBR funding problem.

FT  28 APR 93 / Jardine ousted from board of HK chamber of commerce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MILESTONE in Hong Kong's return to China was passed last night when
Jardine Matheson, the British trading company, was thrown off the board of
the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce.
Election victories by pro-Beijing businessmen left the board evenly split
between supporters and opponents of Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor.
Mr Martin Barrow, a senior executive of Jardine Pacific, Jardine's core
trading, distribution and construction arm, stood for re-election and was
defeated in a battle organised in part by the Xinhua news agency, Beijing's
unofficial embassy in Hong Kong.
This is the first time since the chamber, the colony's leading business
association, was founded in 1861 that a representative of Jardine has not
sat on the board.
Beijing has gained control of Hong Kong's other main business associations.
But the chamber has so far refused to come out against Mr Patten and has
withdrawn its support from the Business and Professionals Federation which
in November made a strong attack on the governor.
Six seats on the 24-member board, vacated by rotation, were contested in a
secret ballot. Five pro-Beijing businessmen were elected while one
incumbent, Mr Simon Lee, was re-elected.
Among the successful candidates were Mr Chan Wing Kee, a textile
manufacturer who is also a Hong Kong deputy to the National People's
Congress, China's rubber-stamp parliament, and Mr Ye Longfei, a Shanghai
government official on long-term secondment to Arthur Andersen, the
accountancy firm.
The campaign Beijing mounted to gain control of the chamber's board reflects
the seriousness with which China takes the Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong
Kong's lawmaking body. The chamber elects one of the 60 members of LegCo, a
position held by Mr Jimmy McGregor, an outspoken Patten supporter.
After last night's vote, Mr McGregor said: 'I interpret this vote as a
turning point. The pro-China group within the chamber backed by those of
like interest have made a very substantial dent in the chamber's system.'
Xinhua officials have recently visited some of the chamber's bigger
corporate group members and presented executives with China's preferred
ticket.

FT  28 APR 93 / Leading Article: Ciampi in charge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CARLO Azeglio Ciampi, the Bank of Italy governor, appears to be proof
that, in Italian politics, the reverse of Gresham's law holds true: good
central bankers can drive out bad politicians.
Mr Ciampi's move to the helm of an interim government in Rome supplies final
evidence of the bankruptcy of the political establishment. The appointment
of the first non-political head of an Italian government for more than 100
years reflects the Bank of Italy's stature as an institution unsullied by
scandal. It also illustrates President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's failure to
find a politician of influence and standing capable of guiding the country
to early elections.
Mr Ciampi, who will remain governor for the time being, has achieved an
increase in the Bank of Italy's independence. He has persuaded the
government to end the central bank's role in deficit financing - presumably
saving him from the embarrassment, in his new job, of providing his own
government's overdraft.
Mr Ciampi's nomination brings relief to financial markets. But, even in
matters of shorter-term political and economic management, it leaves
questions open. Mr Ciampi's persistent criticism of successive governments'
free spending has won him esteem. Yet these governments' equally persistent
refusal to heed his advice has not enhanced his reputation for getting
results. Since 1980, when Mr Ciampi first warned of profligacy, Italy's
public debt has grown from 62 to 112 per cent of GDP.
To steer through electoral reforms, and to limit the deficits, Mr Ciampi
will need a grip on parliament. A man chosen to be above politics will not
be able to avoid descending into the political arena. Mr Ciampi possesses
great moral authority; but even during the few months when il Governatore
runs the government, this may not be enough.

FT  28 APR 93 / Dynamism thrust upon it: The chances of a continued - if
sometimes faltering - UK economic recovery are high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The green shoots of economic spring are appearing once again.'
 - Norman Lamont, October 9 1991
'All that Britain is waiting for to achieve recovery is the confidence a
Conservative victory will bring. So vote Conservative on Thursday and the
recovery will continue on Friday.'
 - John Major, April 7 1992
'We are beginning to see recovery. I think it is self-evident from what
businesses are saying.'
 - John Major, April 22 1993.
Green shoots are sprouting. The frost of the UK's long economic winter is
thawing. Naturally, the prime minister and the chancellor of the exchequer
are delighted. They even behave as if they were entitled to take credit for
this good news. Either they have remarkably short memories or, more likely,
they hope the electorate has. Was it not Mr Lamont who argued as recently as
August 1992 that devaluation was fool's gold and would lead to higher
interest rates, not lower ones?
Fortunately for the economy, the chancellor has so far been wrong, not an
unprecedented event. But there is one important person, Mr Jacques Delors,
who hopes he was right last August. The president of the European Commission
is worried about what would happen to the European Community's move to
economic and monetary union if the British wagon were to reach stable
non-inflationary growth after uncoupling from the train and taking a siding
as well. He must be praying the economy goes into the buffers.
The people of the UK are bound to view matters rather differently. After a
peak-to-trough decline of 4 per cent in non-oil gross domestic product and a
recession lasting two and a half years, they feel they have earned their
relief. Their travails may have been nothing compared to the collapses in
central and eastern Europe, but this has been the longest UK recession since
the 1930s.
The evidence of recovery is clear. Non-oil GDP was up 0.6 per cent in the
first quarter of this year over the last quarter of 1992, according to
preliminary estimates; the volume of retail sales rose 1.6 per cent between
the same two quarters; manufacturing output was up 1.2 per cent in the three
months to February over the preceding three months; car production has
reached its highest March level for 19 years; activity in the housing market
has increased at last; business confidence has improved; and seasonally
adjusted unemployment fell by 52,000 between January and March, a
performance that seems too good to be true, but must mean something.
The recession has ended, which is hardly surprising. Over the two years of
membership in the European exchange rate mechanism, base rates of interest
fell from 15 to 10 per cent. They have fallen by a further 4 percentage
points since sterling left the ERM, while the depreciation of the effective
exchange rate has been 15 per cent. Moreover, the yield curve now slopes
upward, with the redemption yield on 20-year gilts 2 1/2 percentage points
above base rate.
The loosening of monetary policy has been superimposed on a relaxation of
fiscal policy both longstanding and remarkable. The general government
financial balance has moved from a surplus of 1 per cent of GDP in 1988-89
to the deficit of 9 per cent forecast by the Treasury for 1993-94. Moreover,
about 4 percentage points of this deterioration is structural, not cyclical,
according to the February economic survey of the UK by the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development.
Some economies are born dynamic; some achieve dynamism; and some have
dynamism thrust upon them. The British economy of 1993 falls into the third
category. But perhaps, like Malvolio, it is being flattered to be deceived.
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, stressed last weekend
that Britain is heading for a recovery that would be modest compared with
that of the 1980s, though he also hoped it would be better sustained. His
view is in line with the latest Treasury forecasts, which are far more
cautious than those of a year ago. These are for growth in non-North Sea GDP
of 1 1/2 per cent between 1992-93 and 1993-94, followed by 2 1/4 per cent in
1994-95, 2 3/4 per cent in 1995-96 and 3 per cent in 1996-97. According to
the Treasury, the GDP of 1989-90 would not be regained until 1994-95.
Some forecasters are still more nervous. The February report from the
Treasury's panel of independent forecasters included a lowest forecast of
0.2 per cent for growth between 1992 and this year, followed by a lowest
forecast of 1.4 per cent for 1994. Peter Warburton of Robert Fleming (a
member of the 'Liverpool six' group of economists, who opposed sterling's
membership of the ERM, and the most accurate City forecaster of GDP growth
in 1992), argues that there will be no growth between 1992 and this year and
1.1 per cent in 1994.
Excellent reasons can be supplied for such caution:
the hesitant recoveries of debt-laden industrial countries such as Australia
and the US;
the German recession now blighting continental Europe;
the doubling of UK personal indebtedness in the 1980s and the resultant
unwillingness of private individuals to borrow;
the roughly 1.7m households with negative housing equity;
the losses of commercial banks and consequent unwillingness to lend;
the recent sharp reductions in the interest income of the unindebted;
and the lost incomes of the unemployed, the principal victims of the
recession, not to mention the reduced spending of the millions more who fear
unemployment.
Many of these sources of weakness are reflected in the low growth of broad
money (see chart). Tim Congdon of Lombard Street Research - who has won
attention by belabouring his seven fellow Treasury panellists over the role
of money in the economy - wrote in the February panel report that 'the very
low rate of broad money growth now being recorded, combined with the bleak
outlook for the world economy, argues that the current weak revival of
demand will not be maintained'.
Slow monetary growth may not prove that binding a constraint on demand.
First, the ratio of broad money to nominal GDP doubled in the course of the
1980s. But recent declines in the real return on money must have reduced the
willingness of people to hold this bloated stock. Any such desire for lower
holdings of money is likely to leak into demand. Second, the government can
always inject additional monetary stimulus.
Chances of a continued - if sometimes faltering - recovery must be high. If
household demand proves inadequate, the government can relax monetary
policy, something that declining interest rates in continental Europe should
make relatively easy. Indeed the government's problem is more likely to be
an excessively strong currency than a weak one.
The benign effects of any normal recovery on unit costs, combined with
annual increases in underlying earnings as low as 4 1/2 per cent, should
also facilitate recovery, by keeping underlying inflation down,
notwithstanding the devaluation. But the fundamental reason why inflation
should remain subdued is that output is well below its potential, though
nobody knows how far below. Estimates vary hugely, with Patrick Minford of
Liverpool University (another Treasury panellist) setting the
non-inflationary level of unemployment as low as 1m, which is 2m below its
current level.
One extreme indication of how far below potential output the economy might
be is given by the 2.4 per cent annual growth trend between the cyclical
peaks of 1979-80 and 1988-89. Output in these peak years was unsustainable.
But if the economy's underlying trend in the last cycle were sustained into
the present one, this line, which is 13 per cent above this year's output,
ought to be approached before the next downturn. Meanwhile, the OECD
estimates that fourth-quarter 1992 GDP was 6.9 per cent below its underlying
trend. On either view, the economy ought to be able to grow at some 3 per
cent a year for more than a decade.
Mr Minford and Mr Congdon argue that with prudent monetary policy the
economy can readily sustain such performance. Others, such as Wynne Godley
of Cambridge University (another Treasury panellist) and Bill Martin of
Phillips &amp; Drew (a member of the 'Liverpool six'), are not so sure, the
danger, in their view, resting with one or both of the UK's 'twin deficits',
but above all with the external deficit.
Judged by the flow of revenue and expenditure, the UK's fiscal position is
the worst it has ever been in peacetime. The primary fiscal deficit - the
general government borrowing requirement, less interest payments - is 6 per
cent of GDP, 2 percentage points higher than in 1974-75 and 1975-76. The
present fiscal position simply cannot be sustained for many years.
Economic growth and firm control over public spending are the best ways to
cure the fiscal disease. Under the Treasury forecasts, the PSBR falls to 3
3/4 per cent by 1997-98, while the ratio of net public-sector debt to GDP
almost doubles between 1991-92 and 1997-98. This must be about as bad a
performance as the government can hope to get away with.
Economic growth will itself help cure the hole in the fiscal accounts. But
any recovery led by domestic demand would considerably increase a current
account deficit that was already 2 per cent of GDP at the bottom of a deep
recession. If the external balance were to deteriorate, there would come a
point, many critics fear, when financial markets would panic, sterling would
tumble, inflation would soar, the government would be forced to raise
interest rates and - hey, presto - the economy would be back in the stop
phase of a severe stop-go cycle, for the fourth time since the early 1970s.
Whether or not there is a 'balance of payments constraint' is both a
controversial and a complex question. But some points should be accepted by
any cautious policymaker. First, large swings in real exchange rates are
disruptive, principally because output of tradable goods and services cannot
be switched on and off like a tap. Second, market expectations can be
perverse. Less than five years ago, after all, financial markets were trying
to push sterling above DM3.30. Third, making the exchange rate the main tool
of disinflation is risky, since the real appreciation inherent in the policy
is certain to distort the economy. For this very reason, the policy may also
fail to provide a durable route to low inflation.
The question is how far the government can manage either the exchange rate
or the external account. The answer is that it can do less than many critics
believe. But it is not helpless. It can, for example, buttress the exchange
rate with other disinflationary instruments: fiscal tightening is the
obvious one right now. It can also both stress and take into account the
effects upon the real exchange rate of developments in pay and productivity.
A real depreciation entails a lowering of the cost of labour relative to the
prices of tradable goods and services. A nominal depreciation implies a
once-and-for-all rise in the price level. The government should therefore at
least articulate its inflation target in terms of underlying domestic costs,
not consumer prices.
Renewed inflation is what threatens to put an end to growth. The good news
is that underlying inflationary pressure is more subdued than for perhaps a
quarter of a century. The bad news is that the economy has become
exceptionally unbalanced. Domestic demand-led growth would improve the
fiscal position, but make the external position worse. In purest theory, the
external account might not matter. In practice, it is all too likely to do
so. The structure of the economy needs to change in ways that only
export-led growth can bring about. This depends, in turn, on sustaining the
increased competitiveness granted by devaluation.
Sustained recovery is feasible. But the chances of long-term success depend,
as always, on the wisdom of the government and the flexibility of the labour
market. There must be people willing to bet their shirts on what seem to be
two long shots. But how many want to risk going shirtless, even in the
spring?

<TEXT>
WESTERN GOVERNMENTS have reacted with palpable, and understandable, relief
to the vote of confidence which Russian voters registered in their president
on Sunday. Having invested so much political capital in supporting Boris
Yeltsin and his economic policies over the preceding month, they could not
fail to be gratified that those long-suffering citizens who voted saw fit to
approve of both by a convincing margin. But it is far too early for anyone
to breathe easily about the future of Russian reform. On the contrary, the
most painful and urgently needed decisions are yet to come.
It is far from clear how or when President Yeltsin will take them, and
whether his government is either inclined or equipped to make them stick.
But without decisive action now to curb inflation and stabilise the economy,
backed with western aid as promised by foreign and finance ministers from
the Group of Seven industrial nations in Tokyo two weeks ago, the danger of
a hyperinflationary collapse is bound to grow stronger by the week.
Mr Yeltsin's essential problem is the struggle with his opponents in the
Congress of People's Deputies, which the referendum result has done little
to resolve. However strong his popular mandate, the president still has
scant prospect of persuading deputies to accept a new constitution that will
do them out of a job. If he fails, he may himself set a date for new
parliamentary elections. Either way, Russia seems set for several more
months of political uncertainty, heightened in the autumn by another
election campaign.
It is scarcely a climate in which to expect rational economic policy-making.
More likely, on the evidence of pledges to increase wages, pensions and
credit to industry made by both president and parliament during the weeks
before the referendum, it is a period of pork-barrel promises and
intensifying inflationary pressures, something that the Russian economy will
be unable to stand for very much longer.
The immediate task is complicated by increasingly obvious divisions on the
economy within the government itself. While ministers are unanimous about
the need to control inflation, they have been all too ready to sanction the
granting of new credits to bankrupt state enterprises. Ostensibly united in
their commitment to the market, the president and government have failed to
articulate a plausible strategy for getting there or to give the populace a
coherent explanation of the choices they face.
If anything, the result of Sunday's referendum has thrown those choices into
even starker relief. It showed that President Yeltsin remains the best hope
for Russian reform, and that if he chooses to push ahead with policies which
will make economic and political change irreversible, he should be able to
carry the majority with him.
As important, the campaign exposed the intellectual bankruptcy among Mr
Yeltsin's most vocal opponents. They know what they do not like, yet have
nothing coherent to put in its place. But the campaign also demonstrated the
emergence of a new political class arguing persuasively that talk of a
so-called 'third way', in which change would somehow be made less painful,
is an illusion. In practice, this alternative route will either lead back
towards a command economy, or to chaos, or possibly to both at once.
Although the president's instincts tell him to seek compromise, he should
follow the suggestions of those who understand the choices Russia actually
faces.
This is the message western governments should waste no opportunity to
convey to Russia's leaders over the next few weeks as they prepare to back
their support for Mr Yeltsin with a fresh injection of money. The so-called
'systemic transformation facility' which the IMF plans to start disbursing
in June, without applying strict conditions, is a clear if risky
acknowledgement that a politically stable and reforming Russia is a prize
well worth striving for. If it works, it will help keep the economy ticking
over and contain inflation through what promises to be a turbulent summer.
Mr Yeltsin cannot afford to relax.

FT  28 APR 93 / Leading Article: Pension nerves
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH government appears to be losing its nerve over equalising the
state pension age. Originally it planned to announce this month that the
female pension age would be gradually increased from 60 to 65 to bring women
into line with men. Now it looks like the announcement will be delayed until
the autumn with legislation postponed until 1994-95.
The reason is that a government anxious to avoid controversy believes a
common age of 65 would be unpopular with women. But, unlike other measures
being postponed, such as Post Office privatisation, this is not an issue on
which there is fundamental uncertainty inside government.
The pension age needs to be equalised to remove discrimination between the
sexes. The reason for raising the women's age to 65 rather than cutting the
men's to 60 is to put some limits on the expansion of the state's pension
expenditure - at Pounds 30bn a year already the largest part of the social
security budget.
Given that the population over 65 will grow by about a half in the next 40
years, there are already strong upward pressures on pensions spending.
Picking a common age of 60 would make this problem even worse, costing
taxpayers about Pounds 4bn a year. Choosing one of 65, by contrast, would
save Pounds 4bn.
There are those who accept the need to control costs but would like older
people to have greater choice about when they retire. They propose a
flexible pension age, under which those who retire early would receive a
smaller pension than those retiring later. Though attractive in theory, this
idea is impractical given that the pension is already below the state
poverty line. Anyone trying to live on a reduced pension would find it even
harder to make ends meet.
Moreover, since flexible retirement is not identical to a flexible state
pension age, there are other ways the government could promote choice even
while keeping a fixed pension age. These might include encouraging the
private sector to offer more flexible pensions and working arrangements to
make it easier for older people to phase in retirement.
There is no good case for delay. Given the government's known views on the
matter, the sooner the change is announced, the sooner those affected would
be able to plan their retirements. Nor should the change be too unpopular if
arranged so that no woman currently over 50 would be affected.
In fact, delaying an announcement to avoid controversy would almost
certainly be counterproductive. A government that ran away from such a
decision this early in the electoral cycle would hardly find it easier to
take it when there were only two years or so left before an election. This
is a case when prolonging the agony can only make it worse.

Perhaps the City of London is not so unflappable in the face of IRA

hastily rearranging a press conference on May 4.
'Due to bomb damage at the City of London Club over the weekend, we are
advising all invitees of a change of venue to a more secure location,' it
said. The new place? The Gun Room, HMS Belfast.

Busy man, Lord Owen, what with sorting out battling Serbs, Bosnians,
Croatians, et al, in the former Yugoslavia.
But not too busy to ignore more personal business closer to home. He has
joined the board of a small magazine publisher, New Crane Publishing; his
wife, Debbie Owen, is also on the board.
New Crane Publishing has been set up by Michael Wynn-Jones, husband of one
of the UK's most famous TV cooks, Delia Smith. It is quite a cosy set-up;
Smith's literary agent, coincidentally, is Debbie Owen.
Wynn-Jones, whose last venture was Lloyd's Log, the now-folded bimonthly
magazine, has managed to persuade the hard-nosed bosses of J Sainsbury, the
UK retailer, that their customers should have their own monthly glossy
magazine.
Imaginatively titled Sainsbury's The Magazine, its first issue appears
today.
Among the journalists, photographers and cooks on the board, Lord Owen, for
whom Wynn-Jones has big plans, himself 'wanted to come on the board', and
will contribute his skills 'as a negotiator' and to provide 'some
stability'.

If Giuliano Amato, who last week submitted his resignation, is looking for
another job, he might consider the one he turned down in order to become
Italy's prime minister: negotiating the restructuring of Albania's Dollars
500m foreign debt.
Now more than a year later, and despite pressure from the World Bank, the
Albanian government has still not got round to appointing a negotiator.
After Amato bowed out, the post was offered to an international financier
few had heard of, Nicolas Arsidi.
It would seem that although Arsidi was paid a Dollars 1.6m fee up front, the
negotiations never got off the ground. Arsidi is now in prison in France,
facing fraud charges.
Albania's foreign debt was racked up during the period of political turmoil
which marked the transition to democracy after 45 years of Stalinist
self-sufficiency. Amid the confusion, nobody spotted what was going on at
the state bank.
A large chunk of debt was run up almost overnight. Making the most of their
new screen-based dealing room, Albania's central bankers managed to lose
Dollars 200m on international currency markets in a burst of speculation
early in 1991.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Oh to be in England now that April's here . . . and with it the annual chore
of completing tax returns. But it's more than a chore for those who set the
tax exams; knives are being sharpened as the two main professional
institutes battle for supremacy.
The 7,000-strong (and growing) tax faculty of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales is already considering the content of its
own tax exam to be introduced as early as 1995. But the Institute of
Taxation - whose exam is taken by more than 8,000 practitioners including
accountants and lawyers - is peeved.
Both bodies have issued bitter public statements and yesterday the Institute
of Taxation let it be known that it would not co-operate on the development
of a joint exam with the faculty. 'It is essential that we retain our
independence and control of our own examination that we have developed to
such a high standard,' a terse press release warned.
But if the tax faculty goes its own way, and continues to increase its
membership, it could still undermine its rival. Expect more taxing times
ahead.

FT  28 APR 93 / Observer: Please excuse the bugs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Now that gold bugs, who have had a pretty depressing decade, are apparently
dancing to the music of a George Soros investment, who better to turn to for
a view of the market than the Costa Rican sisters, Mary Anne and Pamela
Aden, that mysterious pair who achieved an extraordinary if eccentric
following in the early 1980s.
First making their name by calling the bear market in 1980 when gold was
right up at Dollars 850 an ounce, the sisters began the Aden Analysis
newsletter out of the faintly unlikely location of San Jose. They are now
principally remembered for predicting gold at Dollars 4,400 by 1986. Barely
a squeak has been heard since.
Observer finally tracked down the pair, still in Costa Rica - 'it helps not
to be distracted by opinion' - and still publishing. 'Excuse the bugs' says
the April 6 issue - but no, that's just the glitches in the new computer
system.
The Adens, Californian-educated but with a Costa Rican mother, sweetly
explain that the gold bug thing is 'just a label that stuck'. It didn't help
that their partner, who, among other things, owned a coin company and from
whom they have since split, 'really pushed gold a lot', says Mary Anne, who
admits to being 'very green' when they started.
The sisters profess to have turned bearish of gold in the mid-1980s - 'which
made a lot of people very angry'. But they have just recently taken a shine
to gold again. Now in their mid-40s, their forecast - 'as long as gold stays
above Dollars 340 for a while, it could go to Dollars 380 or more' - sounds
a little more staid.
Mary Anne says their best record over time has been in foreign exchange. But
sadly that seems harder to sell - the newsletter's circulation has shrunk
from some 9,000 to 2,000.

FT  28 APR 93 / Letter: Asian Development Bank's success rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEORGE V. LIU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The article by Victor Mallet about the success rate of Asian
Development Bank aid projects ('Many ADB projects 'failed' ', April 20)
reported that only 40 per cent of the bank's 28 projects evaluated in 1992
were considered generally successful.
Those projects evaluated represented only a sample of completed projects and
included several complex projects. In addition most had been approved and
completed in the 1980s during a period of unusual turbulence characterised
by the second oil shock, falling non-oil primary commodity prices, and high
interest rates.
Overall the bank's record is much better and shows the picture in reverse.
Sixty per cent of a total of 400 projects evaluated so far have been rated
as generally successful, with 30 per cent partly successful and 10 per cent
unsuccessful. In each case, the bank seems to learn, where possible, how to
improve the design, implementation and performance of its development
projects, to enable it to better account for the effectiveness of the
assistance it provides to its developing members.
Importantly, partly successful projects are not to regarded as 'failed'
projects, nor is the definition controversial. The bank's criteria for
deciding into which category a project falls are comprehensive and
clear-cut.
More importantly, the bank places great emphasis on learning from the
experience of past projects and has developed a widely applauded and
effective feed-back system. Guided by these clear objectives, the banks
recently put into place additional institutional processes to make its
assistance and operations even more efficient.
The bank believes that increased responsiveness to the needs of its
developing members, improved relevance of its sector operations and enhanced
quality of services - by incorporating the lessons of ongoing and completed
operations - will, together, significantly raise the quality of projects
assisted by the bank.

FT  28 APR 93 / Understudy with a principal role: Roger Altman, deputy US
Treasury secretary, outlines his views on policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I thought I knew Washington well,' fumes Mr Roger Altman, deputy US Treasury
secretary, 'but I didn't expect the Republicans to reach this new height of
hypocrisy.'
He is referring to the Senate filibuster that killed President Bill
Clinton's economic stimulus plan last week. How, he wonders, can a party
that presided over a tripling of the national debt have the effrontery to
block a Dollars 16bn jobs package on grounds of fiscal prudence.
Yet, with hindsight, should Mr Clinton have invested so much political
capital in so minor a part of his programme? (Most observers say the
stimulus would not have had an appreciable economic impact.)
Mr Altman will not entertain the idea. 'It was an important insurance
policy,' he says, and warns that gross domestic product figures for the
first quarter (due out tomorrow) will 'underline the economy's fragility'.
Mr Altman has the brisk, confident manner of a successful middle-aged
investment banker. He approaches the interview with deliberation, insisting
that questions are precisely posed and frequently pausing mid-sentence to
collect his thoughts.
He is on the defensive partly because congressional opposition to the
Clinton plan is mounting almost daily. Republicans are certain to fight big
increases in income taxes on high earners while Democratic leaders are
opposing new tax credits for business - seen on Capitol Hill as a flagrant
violation of the 1986 Tax Reform Act which eliminated many loopholes.
The proposed energy tax is also in trouble; Mr Leon Panetta, the budget
director, has publicly voiced fears that Congress may pass a blanket
exemption for agriculture.
A contemporary of Mr Clinton's at Georgetown University, Mr Altman gained an
MBA at Chicago before making a career in financial services. He served as a
senior Treasury official in the Carter presidency then flipped back to Wall
Street for the 1980s bull market, making a pile of money at the Blackstone
Group, an investment bank.
Now he is back in Washington, relishing his role as one of the president's
'inner circle' of economic advisers, intimately involved in crafting policy
on everything from healthcare reform to exchange rates.
But while admirably qualified for the job, is he giving Mr Clinton sound
advice? What does the administration hope to gain by talking the dollar down
against the yen - a policy that is deeply resented in Tokyo especially when
the president himself seems to be one of prime culprits?
Mr Altman denies point blank that this is the policy. 'I don't believe you
can talk a currency in any direction for very long that markets don't want
it to go.' The yen's rise, 'is a product of market forces', a natural
response to the Japanese fiscal stimulus which has improved the outlook for
growth.
With the example of Japan in mind, where gross savings amount to 35 per cent
of GDP, isn't the real challenge for the US to raise the national savings
rate? Given the scale of the challenge is the deficit-cutting plan adequate?
Cutting the deficit in half as a percentage of GDP over four years is a big
step forward in terms of reducing public dissavings, Mr Altman says
defensively.
But is it? The structural deficit (the deficit allowing for cyclical changes
in economic activity) is scheduled to fall about Dollars 45bn next fiscal
year to Dollars 205bn.
But no further reduction is planned; the structural deficit rises steadily
to about Dollars 242bn in fiscal 1998. Wasn't the administration really just
holding the underlying deficit stable?
'Well . . . that's a very important way of looking at it . . . but it's not
the primary way we did look at it.' The target you set, Mr Altman explains,
is 'a combination of what is required by the economic environment and what
it is possible for the system to absorb'. He claims that planned healthcare
reforms will slow the growth of spending and that the economy may do better
than assumed in the plan.
But given the electoral cycle, haven't you just missed your big chance to
get the deficit down?
'I just don't agree with that.' Mr Altman says the president deserves credit
for bringing about a 'sea-change' in attitudes on the deficit. This is a
moot point: many attribute the change to Texas billionaire Ross Perot's
populist calls for balanced budgets and argue that the Clinton team
misjudged the country's mood. At a time when people were willing to face
sacrifices, it asked for too little.
What is to be gained by proposing increases in marginal tax rates on high
earners of more than a third (from 31 per cent to 40 per cent or more for
those earning in excess of Dollars 250,000 a year)? Won't this depress
savings?
Mr Altman's response is that tax rates are not being raised to levels that
would seriously interfere with economic incentives. 'Let me be very
personal. Nobody I know who earns that kind of money is going to work less
because of those tax increases.'
But won't they rearrange their tax affairs to reduce their tax liability? He
seems unperturbed by suggestions from Professor Martin Feldstein of Harvard
and others that high earners will find ways of dodging the new taxes. 'I
guess we're going to disagree.'
But does he not accept the principle of the 1986 act - that lower rates and
a broader base make sense? 'Yes, I do.' But the inequalities of the 1980s
have to be reversed. 'If it's a choice between simplification and
progressivity, I choose progressivity.'
But what about small business? The income tax increases will hit proprietors
of small businesses who file under the personal code. Why depress the sector
that created the most jobs in the 1980s?
It seems that fairness is more important. If they earn enough they will just
have to pay the higher taxes, says Mr Altman.
Is a value-added tax likely, especially given the need to finance healthcare
reforms? He is careful not to rule it out. 'Shifting the emphasis of taxes
from investment to consumption is an important goal. That's why we
recommended an energy tax which, after all, is a consumption tax.'
Picking his words, Mr Altman adds: 'Whether we ever raise a VAT is not known
to me. I truly have no idea.'
Extending health cover to an extra 35m people and guaranteeing everybody a
generous package of basic benefits could be hugely expensive. What chance is
there of Congress agreeing to an extra Dollars 90bn or so a year in extra
taxes to pay for the new benefits?
He dislikes the tone of the question. A primary goal of the healthcare
reform is to reduce the rate of growth of spending, not increase it, he
explains patiently. But he is vague both about how costs will be reduced and
over what time horizon.
There has to be more market discipline in the health system - 'that's why
we're enthusiastic about managed competition,' he says. But he won't be
drawn on whether direct controls, such as a cap on health insurance
premiums, are likely. 'I'm not going to debate that with you.'
How soon will any cost controls take effect? Will we see results, say, by
1995? 'I don't know about 1995. I genuinely don't know.'
On economic and social policy, Mr Altman seems to enjoy working as part of
an extended economic team. But is there a risk of having too many economic
cooks? Won't the new National Economic Council run from the White House by
Mr Robert Rubin ultimately undermine the Treasury? (By international
standards, the Treasury is already weak, controlling neither monetary policy
nor the budget.)
He brushes off the question. 'It's a co-ordinating mechanism . . . It's so
successful because of Bob Rubin who has a remarkably winning style.
Everybody likes working with him.'
Mr Altman, it must be said, is just as smooth an operator. If Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, his boss, were ever to decide that retirement in Texas looked more
attractive than endless wrangles with Congress, his understudy is more than
ready to take centre-stage.

FT  28 APR 93 / Letter: Too early to see effect of Cadbury proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PATRICK MILEHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, A propos your article on the research published in the Corporate
Register which covers the 'latest innovations of corporate governance',
('Governance changes 'not productive' ', April 22), we at the Institute of
Leadership believe it is far too early to see results, commercial or
otherwise, that could be the result of the recommendations of the Cadbury
committee.
Cadbury's report referred to 'the financial aspects of corporate
governance', not competitiveness and profitability. The recommended
enhancement of the role of non-executive directors was to do with their
assistance in ensuring the probity of public companies, and nothing more.
True, there has been debate, mainly concerning the large and listed
companies, about the usefulness of proactive non-executive directors with
regard to their contribution to strategic direction and the high performance
of the company on whose board they sit. Up to now, however, it has been
unfocused and barely touched the smaller and unlisted companies.
We have just launched a UK-wide research programme in conjunction with the
University of Paisley. Its purpose is to investigate the growing ambiguity
of the position of non-executive directors and to answer such questions as:
can they act equally as effective gamekeepers (probity) and poachers
(profitability)? Can they be truly independent? How 'unitary' is the board?
What selection, training and induction processes can be designed to help
non-executives to balance these divergent duties?
We would defer judgment on any financial or other indicators to measure the
effectiveness of non-executive directors to some time in the future.
Both the Cadbury committee's report and the Corporate Register's article
only deal with listed companies. We believe that research must penetrate the
smaller and medium enterprises (SME) as well, where the need for
non-executive directors to assist in transforming their companies is even
more urgent than in big companies.
The SMEs have been in a much worse state during the recession than the large
companies, and it is almost a truism to say that many SMEs have failed
precisely for lack of direction from the board.

<BYLINE>
   From Professor C. WANKEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest the letter from Michael Connors (April 21) on John
Diebold's recent talk of 'the need for a new word: 'infostructure' '.
Connors points out to us the astounding coincidence that he independently
crafted this word back in 1992 and cites his use of it 'throughout' his 1993
book as evidence. Well this amazing fact can be amplified since by even more
amazing coincidence this word has been 'independently' crafted by scores of
others.
One such amazing coincidence is Karen Levitan's 1987 book Government
Infostructures (Greenwood Press). Others include P. Zurkowski's 1984
Integrating America's Infostructure in the Journal of American Society for
Information Science and Forest and Woody Horton's 1982 Understanding US
Information Policy: the Infostructure Handbook.
Connors also might phone Infostructures Inc. in one of their offices in
Rockville or Potomac, Maryland, or in Hallandale, Florida, to talk about
this neologism. Of course, it might be cheaper to phone Infostructures Ltd.
in Birmingham, England.

FT  28 APR 93 / Friend when in need: The west holds Turkey at arm's length
but relies on its support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turgut Ozal deserved more than a polite nod from western leaders. There is
something about Turkey that deflects the gaze of the western onlooker.
Everyone knows it is important, but no one seems to like thinking about it.
I suspect the problem is that it is not quite big enough to have a
department all to itself, whether in a foreign ministry or a university, and
yet it does not fit neatly into any group or category. That, of course, is
precisely what makes it such a fascinating country, when you do look at it.
But most westerners are just too busy to be fascinated. At least one caller
to this office last week assumed, on being told I was in Turkey, that I must
be on holiday.
I wish I had been on holiday. Alternatively, I wish I could truthfully say I
had gone there to attend President Ozal's funeral. In fact I went to help
write the Financial Times's annual survey of Turkey, and it was pure chance
that Ozal died the day before I arrived. The result was, however, that I was
able to listen to a lot of Turks talking about the leader they had lost.
To say they were unanimously grief-stricken would be an exaggeration, though
certainly many were more charitable than they would have been before his
death. The fact is that, while alive, Ozal was disliked by many of his
countrymen and especially by the media. Like Lady Thatcher, whom he admired
(though he did not follow her monetarist policies), he was attacked both for
widening the gap between rich and poor and for making the country
subservient to the US. He stuck his neck out especially during the Gulf war,
rather as she did in allowing US aircraft from British bases to bomb Tripoli
in 1986. Indeed, Turkish feeling against the use of Turkish bases to bomb
Iraq was stronger and more widespread than the corresponding feeling in
Britain at the time of the Libyan attack.
At the time western leaders heaped praise on Ozal. George Bush and Margaret
Thatcher both claimed him as a personal friend. I fully expected to see them
at his funeral, and so did many Turks. But they failed to show, as did their
successors. The US was represented by Jim Baker, the former secretary of
state, and by his successor's deputy, Cliff Wharton; the UK by Baroness
Chalker, minister of overseas development; France by its foreign trade
minister.
John Major and Douglas Hurd, of course, were required in the division lobby
 -Maastricht oblige. Bush was busy with his presidential library. Clinton
was struggling to get his economic package through the Senate. Thatcher and
Vice-President Al Gore were somewhere in eastern Europe. No doubt Francois
Mitterrand and Warren Christopher had equally good excuses. But couldn't we
have managed at least a member of the royal family?
Anyway, for the funeral of a close friend and valued ally none of the
excuses is good enough. When a friend dies you drop everything and rush to
console his family. If these people really valued Turkish friendship, as
they claim to, they would have been there.
'Turkey helped the west in the Gulf war,' said my friend Sait Dilek sadly.
'Perhaps another time it will not bother.' Of course that is a highly
sentimental response. Sait, a young Kurd who worked for Ozal's government
and was deeply devoted to him, was feeling sentimental that day. Many Turks
were. Ozal, however, did not decide his Gulf policy on sentimental grounds,
and it is unlikely that another Turkish leader would do so in a future
crisis. It was not in Turkey's national interest to give free rein to an
aggressive and expansionist ruler in a neighbouring country. Still, it is
not always easy to act on a rational calculation of national interest when
public opinion is against you; and public opinion can be swayed by
sentiment.
A convincing show of gratitude to the dead president would not have cost the
west much. Why was it not forthcoming?
'I suppose they just thought of him as a wog,' says one disillusioned
English Turcophile. Perhaps, at its crudest, that is right. We think of the
Turks as Moslems, ergo non-Europeans. So their insistence that they are
European only irritates us. With their suits and ties and their Roman
script, the Turks lack even the exotic charm of the desert.
The Islamic lobby in Turkey feeds on this attitude. It loves to quote a
remark, allegedly made by Jacques Delors, the president of the European
Commission, on the day before Ozal addressed the European Parliament, to the
effect that Europe consists of 'countries of Judeo-Christian identity'. To
Turkish minds that explains a lot of things, such as why Europe leaves
Bosnian Moslems to their fate; why children born in Germany of Turkish
parents are not entitled to German citizenship; and why Turkey's application
for membership in the EC is pigeon-holed, while 'Christian' countries, not
only from the European Free Trade Association but from the former Warsaw
Pact, are encouraged to jump the queue.
Some people think that Ozal, himself a devout though liberal Moslem,
deliberately courted this reaction when he slammed in Turkey's EC
application in 1987, and that the present Demirel government is more
sincerely, as well as more subtly, European in going for a customs union
first, leaving both Turkey and the Community more time to evolve before the
issue of full membership is taken up again.
Maybe. There are certainly many problems to be solved before full membership
could be realistically considered, not the least being the Cyprus issue and
the consequent Greek veto. But at least Greece does not make the mistake of
underrating Turkey's importance - Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime
minister, did show up in Ankara last week.

FT  28 APR 93 / Letter: Heseltine's plans for industry fall short
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON HASKEL and SIR SIGMUND STERNBERG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The general thrust of Michael Heseltine's plans to help British
industry as reported by you on April 26 ('Heseltine's plan 'to help Britain
win' ') is to be welcomed. Many of his proposals regarding innovation,
exports, one-stop shops and competitiveness could have been drawn point by
point from Labour's own plans for partnership between government and
industry.
As such, they are soundly based because these plans resulted from long and
detailed discussions between members of the Labour party and industry. Some
of these discussions were carried out by the Labour finance and industry
group.
Unfortunately Mr Heseltine ignores three important elements called for by
industry and essential for success. To be charitable, this may be because he
has little influence over his more hide-bound colleagues.
First, education. Industry needs a well-trained and educated workforce to
innovate, to export, to be competitive and to manage. Second, capital
investment. Britain needs a modern and well-run infrastructure to enable
industry to operate effectively and cheaply. Third, finance. The City must
allow industry to invest in Mr Heseltine's plans, perhaps at the cost of
lower dividends and greater risk.

I have never talked to a lifeboat man who did not admit to being frightened
of the sea; stupid to be otherwise, you may say. But that does not prevent
them repeatedly braving the worst conditions around our coasts; among the
worst in the world. ITV begins a six-part documentary series, Lifeboat,
illustrating a year in the life of Salcombe's RNLI crew (7.00). Continuing
on The Great Picture Trail (7.30 BBC2) Neil MacGregor, director of the
National Gallery, considers Titian's 'Bacchus and Ariadne' and Mondrian's
'Composition With Grey, Red, Yellow And Blue', very suitable for printing on
tea towels. QED records how a specialist from Great Ormond Street Hospital
attempted to bring to his own patients the benefits of a Chinese herbalist
who works from a Soho basement. Six days a week Dr Luo treats the first 50
patients who write their names on a list taped to her door. Most suffer from
eczema (9.30 BBC1). It is almost embarrassing to find how little difference
the absence of Dorothy makes to the Golden Girls who are now appearing as a
trio in The Golden Palace (10.00 C4).

FT  28 APR 93 / Arts: Confusion in the middle ground - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the old ITV the received wisdom was that you won ratings with lowbrow
stuff such as darts matches and moronic game shows but acquired prestige
with expensive drama. Now the belief is that if you pick the right sort of
drama you can win reasonable ratings and prestige simultaneously, and in the
long term build a loyal audience. Hence the abandonment of darts, a
reduction in game shows, and an increase in middlebrow drama such as The
Bill, London's Burning and all those steam train detective series.
However, the formula can go horribly wrong, as we saw last weekend with the
screening of embarrassing flops on successive evenings. The Marshall looked
a bit like another Europudding, those dramas filmed somewhere in continental
Europe with international casts and umpteen co-producers in the hope that
the Germans, French and British will all like them.
The idea has never worked yet and probably never will, but the oddest aspect
of The Marshall was that although it had the characteristically false tones
of the dubbed programme it appeared to have been recorded in English
lip-synch, and although it was set in Florence the cast all seemed to be
British, from Alfred Molina as the Italian police marshall and Gemma Craven
as his wife to such small roles as Clementina, which was taken by Anna
Cropper. To use such an impressive cast to make such a lead-footed and
boring programme was a shame.
But at least it was not intent upon stuffing its political correctness down
the viewer's throat, which is such a characteristic of Lynda La Plante's
work. From Widows to Sunday's Seekers Ms La Plante has been dishing up the
same combination of resourceful, reliable women and violent, hateful men. No
doubt politically correct broadcasters wriggle with delight over her
multiracial casts, however unlikely the teamings.
This time we were given tubby, blonde, middle-aged Stella and svelte, black,
young Susie. And their chief factor in common? A husband; the same one,
simultaneously. The absolute b-b-bigamist. But what can you expect from a
man . . . when he emerges from the mind of La Plante, anyway. As in Prime
Suspect you can ignore all this sermonising flim-flam if there is a good
taut plot to follow, but Seekers was hopelessly confused.
*****
First acquaintance with Ruby Wax in Girls On Top suggested one of those
American women with more drive and chutzpah than talent. Second thoughts,
when she began doing her own weird shows, was that she might be able to
create a world of her own in a way that only Barry Humphries had previously
managed. But the first of a new series of The Full Wax on BBC1 last Thursday
brought third thoughts: perhaps the joky sadism which requires Joanna Lumley
to play a mentally unstable lush, thrown over by her husband in favour of a
bimbo with big boobs (Ms Wax meets Miss La Plante) cloaks a genuine streak
of cruelty.
Still, Lumley had the last laugh: not only was she very funny parodying her
own character from The Avengers, and just as good as Jennifer Saunders
(whose mannerisms and tone of voice she adopted, wittingly or not) in the
comedy recipe sequence, but at the end, spattered with cream and breathless
from portraying hysteria, she was still achingly beautiful . . . which is
hardly the first phrase that springs to mind in describing Ms Wax. Precisely
the sub-text of the skit, you may say, but does Ruby Wax really accept her
own appearance in the way that, say, Phyllis Diller seems to, or is the joke
jealousy actually all too real?
*****
Best comedy of the week, and for a very long time, was the first in a new
series of The Comic Strip Presents on BBC2. Oddly enough this also took the
form of a pastiche of action series from the seventies. There was Jason
Bentley, a Peter Wyngarde lookalike in lace cuffs and crushed velvet flares,
whose modus operandi was to drive the Rolls to a country house occupied by a
mad colonel and his daughter (mini skirt and too much makeup), drink a
bottle of claret, smoke 50 cigarettes and arrest everybody. Jim Broadbent
played Shouting George of 'The Weeney', a 10-Guv-a-day copper who always
drifted his car into the police yard sideways. And the stars were Bonehead
and Foyle, who saw their job as climbing chimneys, doing handbrake turns,
and pointing automatics while bellowing 'Freeze]'
*****
However irritating you may find John Pilger, from the grinding monotone of
the voice to the hectoring didacticism of the manner, you surely have to
admit that he is right about Pol Pot, Cambodia and the spinelessness of the
international community, and you have to admire his tenacity.
Alone among the battalions of television journalists, Pilger seems to mind
that a cosmetic job is being done on the genocidal Khmer Rouge to enable the
UN to claim that it has organised democratic elections in Cambodia. Having
gone back to the country again and again, Pilger made yet another visit for
Viewpoint 93 on ITV and left no one in doubt about his feelings: that
suppressing the name of the Khmer Rouge and tolerating their 'participation'
in elections is like suppressing the name of the Nazi party and tolerating
their participation in European elections.
*****
Installing a camera crew in a family house and filming the result may be a
perfectly legitimate form of entertainment but it is surely time that
television stopped pretending that it is a way of investigating reality.
Paul Watson, who produced the 12-part BBC1 series Sylvania Waters which
began on Thursday, is having a second go at copying the famous 1972 American
series which used 'fly on the wall' techniques to observe the effects of
cameras on family life. His first attempt was with the Wilkins family in
Reading in 1974.
Watson describes his new series, about the Baker-Donaher family in Sydney as
'living soap opera', which sounds admirably modest, and seems to go some way
towards admitting the unreality of the affair - but I wonder. Perhaps the
bickering, boozing Noelene and Laurie deserve everything that is coming to
them, but - like others before them in this situation - they now regret ever
having become involved. No one who really appreciated the likely outcome
would ever agree to such an arrangement in the first place. No doubt that
explains why we always see the same sort of crass egotists in this sort of
series. As we laugh at their antics in the coming weeks it might be as well
to abandon Watson's word 'living' and consider it as just another Australian
soap opera, designed largely to appeal to unsophisticated teenagers.
*****
Channel 4's culture magazine Without Walls goes from strength to strength.
Earlier this season it showed an unusual trio of programmes about the
effects of drug taking upon the creation of works of art, and last night it
concluded another trio, this time about technology and man's mastery (or
otherwise) of nature.
The twist that has made it such an engrossing series is that instead of just
talking to the usual white-coated scientists in rimless glasses it talked
mainly to science fiction writers. Remembering the accuracy of some of the
predictions of writers such as HG Wells and Arthur C. Clarke, and the
technical creativity of Asimov, it is no surprise to discover that Brian
Aldiss, JG Ballard, John Brunner and others now have thoughts - about
artificial intelligence, cloning, virtual reality and so on - which
illustrate activity at the frontiers of modern science far more vividly than
you would expect from plain scientists. Furthermore Without Walls deserves
credit for building some sort of bridge - however narrow, however populist,
however temporary - between the two cultures.

FT  28 APR 93 / Arts: The glories of Rome shine anew - Exhibitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNIFER GREGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two current exhibitions in Rome prove once again how much that city owes to
the worldly talents of the Catholic church. Both 'The Borghese Gallery' at
St Michele a Ripa and 'Sixtus V' centre on the Papacy; both relate to the
late Renaissance and early Baroque.
The first marks the re-appearance of 300 paintings from the magnificent
Borghese collection which have been in storage for nine years while the
villa has been restored. Given the pace of Italian restoration these could
be in San Michele for two years. The second looks at the radical changes
made to the city during the short reign of a remarkable Pope, Sixtus V.
Cardinal Scipione Borghese was the favourite nephew of Pope Paul V
(1605-1621). A passionate collector, he brought the nucleus of his grand
collection with him when the family moved to Rome from Siena. There, he
built one of the world's finest patrician art collections. Scipione showed
particular acumen in his enthusiasm for Caravaggio: a passion not shared by
his fellow cardinals at St Peter's, who commissioned and then, shocked at
the nakedness of the boy Christ, refused his masterpiece, the 'Madonna of
the Palafrenieri' (also known as the 'Madonna of the serpent'). The painting
was removed from the Palafrenieri chapel in St Peter's and sold to Scipione.
Even though only about half the 566 paintings in the collection are here,
fitting them into the small de-consecrated church posed many problems. The
organisers found a clever solution - but somewhat shocking for those who
remember their original luxurious setting.
The paintings are crowded together, almost touching, in lines four deep, in
the casually cluttered manner used by collectors in the late 1600s. However,
one important detail has been forgotten. The pictures at the top (rarely the
masterpieces) are difficult to see. Early collectors got round this by
tilting the top row downwards towards the visitors below, but this has not
been done here.
All six of Scipione's Caravaggio's are on show, as is Domenichino's
splendid, newly-restored 'Caccia di Diana'. There are several works by the
Ferrarese Dosso Dossi, including his mysterious 'Apollo and Daphne' and the
'Maga Circe'; Cranach's magnificent Venus with Cupid and his honeycomb;
Carpaccio's enigmatic 'Courtesan'; and two of the Cardinal's Titians. Not,
sadly, the gem of the collection, 'Sacred and Profane Love', nor his 'Venus
blindfolding Cupid', both being restored. Another famous omission is
Raphael's 'Deposition', considered too delicate to move.
'The Rome of Sixtus V' at Palazzo Venezia celebrates (a little late) the
fourth centenary of the Pope's death. The exhibition gives some idea of what
an absolute monarch with vision and a well-lined purse can make of an
insalubrious mediaeval town. But the organisers' determination to show us
every aspect of Sixtus's frenetic activity, from coins and commemorative
medallions to sections on books and music, detracts a little from the
excitement of his central achievement.
One gets a better idea of the grandeur of his plans by standing at the
Quattro Fontane crossroads on the hill in the centre of Rome. Here, Sixtus's
brainchild, the Via Felice, crosses the road designed by his predecessor
Pius V (now known as the Via XX Settembre) 20 years earlier.
Domenico Fontana's four fountains were carved into each corner of the
crossroads to disguise the imperfect right-angles of the small square.
Standing with one's back to Borromini's church of St Carlo, there is a
breathtaking view down each of the four roads.
The grandeur of Sixtus's design does not come out clearly in the exhibition,
as no contemporary plans exist to show what Sixtus and his architects
thought they were doing. Contrary to some of the contemporary
interpretations, Sixtus's plans were dictated only partly by ecclesiastical
considerations.
It made sense that the seven main basilicas providing indulgences (which the
faithful flocking to Rome were required to visit on a single day's
pilgrimage) should be linked - to many churchmen the point of Sixtus's
development seemed just that. But Sixtus's plan went far beyond the
practical religious exigencies of the moment. He was concerned with laying
the basis for the city's future social and commercial development, with a
cross-system of wide thoroughfares 'indifferent to expense, and ruthless in
the face of obstacles', as Domenico Fontana pointed out admiringly, opening
out piazzas, both in front of the building he had had constructed, the
Lateran and Quirinal Palaces, and at the intersections of his roads.
In spite of his imaginative and organisational abilities, Sixtus was a cruel
and impatient man. These latter qualities come out in the fine portrait,
attributed to Filippo Bellini, with which the exhibition opens. His
relationship with his architect, Domenico Fontana, however, was highly
successful: they shared a passion for detail and an interest in solving
engineering problems.
A handsome wooden model and numerous engravings in the central part of the
exhibition give some idea of the charms of the Villa Montalto at Termini
(pulled down in 1925 to make way for the railway station). Sixtus designed
this charming country villa, again with Fontana, to soothe his spirits when
enduring semi-exile under the reign of Gregorius III, who disliked him
profoundly.
Another fine model is Vanvitelli's handsome wooden section of the cupola of
St Peter's. Without Sixtus's energy and determination, Michelangelo's
project might never have been completed. Giacomo della Porta and Domenico
Fontana did it in 22 months, using 800 builders.
The last section is devoted to contemporary painting, mostly culled from
Roman churches. There is a splendid Eros and Psyche from the Borghese
collection, a 'Visitation' by Federico Barocci from St Maria in Valicella,
and two fine works by Paul Brill from the Louvre and the Ca D'Oro in Venice.
The Borghese Gallery at St Michele a Ripa, Via di St. Michele a Ripa. Closed
Monday. Ends December 31. The Rome of Sixtus V, Palazzo Venezia. Ends April
30.

<DATELINE>
   I have now seen the Royal Ballet's Don Quixote four times
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
men have been decorated on the battlefield for less - and I remain as
disenchanted by its components, and aghast at its inadequacies, as I was
after the first night. I can find no redeeming feature in it: each element -
of design, production, performance, style, even orchestration - undermines
the real merits of a ballet which, for all its inconsistencies, has lasted
for more than a hundred happy years in the Russian repertory.
Mistrust and misinterpretation have taken a horrid toll on this Don Quixote
and its interpreters. I do not recall the Royal Ballet looking more
uncertain or more provincial, its artists battling with choreography they
plainly do not understand and have not been taught to appreciate. The
standards of classical and character dancing are unworthy.
The choice of the text was wrong-headed: Baryshnikov's pruning of the Kirov
version is ungenerous in scale, hustled in dramatics. Far better to have
used the Kirov original, which is joyous, crammed with varied dances, and
stylistically coherent. It enshrines a way of performing this
classic-Spanish romp which could be exhilarating and challenging for our
dancers. It is also charming to look at, since the designs made by Golovin
in 1902 are beautifully preserved, and beautifully effective. The
unrelenting blare of Mark Thompson's decoration, which extinguishes the
dancers, and his lugubrious costuming (dancers as mortuary attendants),
blight any gaiety. The character playing has a routine air, except for the
inexplicable and scene-stealing drunk who haunts the edges of the stage
throughout the first act; though I wonder what the priest with Red Riding
Hood's basket is offering to the locals as he patrols the plaza - saucy
postcards? Indulgences? Escape plans?
In St Petersburg the score is a tuneful mish-mash, but it exactly suits the
zip and crackle of the dances, with their occasional yearning or classically
serious moments. Covent Garden's gim-crack version betrays its hand as soon
as we hear the honky-tonk piano playing for the inapt front cloth scene that
begins the evening. Nothing good can come of such a view of Minkus, and
nothing does. And no one on stage - save Irek Mukhamedov, who realised he
had fallen on hard times - has any idea of how to deal with the stylistic
demands of such a piece.
We have seen great performers in this ballet, from Plisetskaya (who was a
miracle of joyous bravura) to Maximova and Vasiliev (who were sun bursts),
and I treasure memories of Galina Samsova and Lucette Aldous, of Semenyaka,
of Terekhova, as marvellous heroines. They each brought a sense of ebullient
happiness, of high spirits and higher jumps, of witty playing and wittiest
feet in the variations. The Kitris I have seen thus far - Viviana Durante,
Cynthia Harvey, Fiona Chadwick and Leanne Benjamin - have been cramped by
staging and design, and looked understandably desperate. If the role of
Basilio can defeat Mukhamedov (on the first night he tried to kick-start
this dismal affair, with no success), then lesser artists are simply its
prisoners. Zoltan Solymosi, Stuart Cassidy, Jose Manuel Carreno (making a
debut with the Royal Ballet) deserve more than the strait-jacket of such
charmless routines.
The rest of the cast are baffled from curtain rise. I record with no
pleasure that six toreadors (in costumes that make them look like neckless
wonders with bulging hips) seem unhappy with their one difficult step; that
in the vision scene (where the dryads have only one step to perform,
interminably) the luscious variation for the Dryad Queen has been made
stiffly polite; that the playing of Mercedes and Espada would be more likely
in Bude than Barcelona.
Only Nicola Roberts as Amour has shown the pretty, nuanced dancing than can
make the choreography sparkle as it should. Elsewhere, tambourines,
handclaps and manic vivacity turn Don Quixote into a totentanz. Audiences
have been grossly misled by a staging which ranks among the worst things the
Royal Ballet has shown us in half a century.

FT  28 APR 93 / Business and the Environment: Preserving a profit - The
owners of a Natal game reserve believe conservation can only work if it pays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Zibane Mazibuko illustrates one of Africa's rarest cliches: he is a
poacher-turned-gamekeeper.
Not long ago, this 33-year-old Zulu with broken teeth and ragged clothes,
who speaks seldom and smiles less, was poaching game from the Phinda
Resource Reserve in South Africa's Natal province.
Today, he says his future depends on keeping the animals alive: for they
attract the tourists who bring scarce cash to this forgotten corner of rural
Zululand. Thanks to them, Mazibuko has landed a contract to make 150,000
bricks for the new Phinda game lodge; he reckons he can earn R1,800 (Pounds
370) a month from his new business, far more than he could bag as a poacher.
The owners of Phinda, the South African-based Conservation Corporation,
could not have paid for a better advertisement for their philosophy of
wildlife conservation - a people-based approach to conservation, which is
slowly gaining ground in Africa as game reserves come under ever greater
threat from hungry, poor and angry local populations.
Kevin Leo-Smith is manager of Phinda and a director of the Conservation
Corporation. He and his colleagues - brothers Dave and John Varty, who have
already made a fortune from their brand of ethically-sound conservation -
believe they have found a model to guarantee the survival of wildlife in
Africa.
'The old notion of a game reserve where you put up a fence and chuck the
people out is flawed,' says Leo-Smith. 'You need to make sure the cash flows
through that fence.' Local people must share not only the natural resources
of the reserve - they must be allowed to gather wood for cooking, grasses
for thatching, palm sap for wine-making and indigenous herbs for use by
witch-doctors - but they must benefit from its development.
'We're aiming to use the economic 'exciter' of the lodge to attract
(development and investment) funds, and make sure they get circulated
locally so that local people understand that their future is invested with
us - and that gives them an interest in conservation,' Leo-Smith concludes.
In other words, they intend to turn all the poachers into honorary
gamekeepers. The alternative, says Leo-Smith, is untenable: to live in a
perpetual state of siege, keeping poachers out by force (the status quo in
most other African reserves).
So the motivation for Phinda is more practical than ethical: and therein
lies its best chance of success. For Leo-Smith and the Vartys practise a
capitalist approach to conservation. They believe conservation can and must
be made to pay - especially in South Africa, where a new black government
will probably divert subsidies from state reserves (widely viewed as white
playgrounds) to fund black social development.
Conservation Corp has raised R83m in equity funds, 40 per cent of it from
foreign investors such as Hambros Bank and the Getty family trusts, to
invest in Africa's undervalued wildlife assets, which they argue can be
exploited to produce returns which are attractive and ethically sound.
That means making not only traditional 'social investments' in surrounding
communities - building schools, clinics and housing for employees - but,
more importantly, providing venture capital for local businesses which must
prove commercially viable to survive. Phinda's managers know charity is a
poor substitute for sustainable development: they will provide management
training, marketing advice, cheap loans, equity where necessary - but the
entrepreneurial drive must come from the community.
Mazibuko, the brickmaker, is only one of Conservation Corp's pilot
entrepreneurs. When he was caught poaching, he was so poor he could not pay
the fine imposed by the local tribal court: one cow, the currency of rural
Zulu society. So he worked off his sentence making bricks for the reserve.
Later, Phinda set him up as an independent brickmaker, with two rudimentary
moulding machines and a contract for the new lodge. Phinda provides the raw
materials, and passes all the profit (2 cents per brick) along to Mazibuko,
after a 1 cent per brick repayment on the machinery. He pays his labourers
out of profits and dreams of expansion once the lodge is built. Phinda gets
bricks over a third cheaper than from commercial suppliers.
Not far from Mazibuko's brickworks, Thomas Nkomo - another reformed poacher
 -makes charcoal according to a traditional African method. Where before he
stole wood from the reserve, now he clears unwanted bush for Phinda, and
uses it to build a six-foot high circular pyre. The pyre smoulders for 17
days, yielding 800 5kg bags of highly marketable 'environmentally-friendly'
charcoal.
Nkomo's equity partner, a Phinda game ranger, sells the charcoal for R3.40
per bag. It costs R1.20 to produce, with costs held down further by the fact
that Nkomo's labour is paid through a drought relief scheme funded by a
local development agency.
But if charcoal and brickmaking are at least marginally viable, Phinda's
Sondela entertainment centre could prove really lucrative. Phinda sold 168
R100 shares in Sondela to finance (with the help of a R25,000 interest-free
loan) a centre where, for a nominal fee, employees can enjoy soccer, karate,
body building and ballroom dancing, buy take-away food and drinks and have
their photo taken by a local photographer.
Phinda aims to ensure that Sondela shares pay an 80 to 100 per cent annual
dividend, to popularise the idea of share ownership in a hostile
environment; loan repayments will be deferred until the project makes
sufficient profit.
Leo-Smith admits that Phinda does not put large amounts of its own money
into these schemes, though he says the reserve supports 10 per cent of the
local population (directly or indirectly). But Africa is littered with large
and expensive development schemes which, inevitably, fail; spending small
sums well, on commercially viable development - the Phinda method - is far
more difficult than pouring shareholder funds into charity projects which do
more for the donor's self-image than for the recipient's prosperity.

FT  28 APR 93 / Business and the Environment: Tide of anger rises at the
cost of clean living - Worldwide water / Sewage laws and reunification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERBERT Losem from Konigswinter, a sleepy town on the Rhine, has bitter
words to say about water pollution controls in Germany.
Already paying a high price for drinking water, he now faces heavier taxes
for sewage treatment. With some of the most stringent environmental laws in
Europe coming into effect and public finances under strain, Losem and other
German citizens find they have to foot a heavier than expected bill for a
clean Germany, especially with the costs of reunification.
'Environment is our national ideology. It is completely political and
economics have little to do with it,' says Losem, who is also Konigswinter's
finance director.
Konigswinter, best known for its annual Anglo-German parliamentary seminars,
once took all its water from the Rhine and returned it there. Today, despite
recent announcements that 50 species of fish are once again swimming there,
the Rhine remains too polluted to be used as drinking water along much of
its length.
Instead, the town takes its water from the hills, and households pay some of
the highest prices in Europe. Waste water ends up in sewage plants, which
have to meet ever stricter anti-pollution requirements.
As tougher environmental laws bite, Konigswinter faces massive investments
in water infrastructure and waste water treatment. Like other municipalities
in Germany, it has been fighting a bitter political battle to gain time and
ease legislative pressure.
With six river basins, a humid climate and Europe's two largest rivers
running across its territory, Germany hardly faces water scarcity. Instead,
water management efforts have focused on the legal protection of existing
sources against pollution.
Germany has some of the toughest environmental laws in Europe and has been
at the forefront of efforts to promote similar directives in Brussels to
gain Europe-wide implementation for its anti-pollution standards.
Concern for the environment grew in the 1960s and 1970s with fears that
pollution control was being outpaced by the country's fast post-war
re-industrialisation and it is now an important issue for all German
political parties.
Recent environmental laws have been very successful in reducing water
pollution. Following the introduction of the 1975 Washing and Cleaning
Agents Act, which means detergents contained in washing products must be 90
per cent biodegradable, products containing phosphate have almost
disappeared.
In 1957, the Federal Water Act *something in here (HP) *
laid down anti-pollution controls whose standards are far stricter than
anything found in other countries. Recent amendments on waste water are
forcing sewage plants to have not only mechanical and biological water
treatments, which clean an estimated 85 per cent of waste water, but also
very complex new chemical treatments.
Between 1970 and 1990, local authorities spent more than DM100bn (Pounds
40bn) on the construction, extension and overhaul of the sewage system and
treatment plants. More than DM12bn is spent annually on effluent disposal.
In the 1990s, compliance with these requirements by all municipal and
industrial treatment facilities will still require considerable investment
by local authorities and industry. Municipal sewage plants alone are likely
to cost more than DM10bn in west Germany and more than DM40bn in the east.
Similar investments are needed to extend the sewage system. An estimated
DM60bn to DM70bn is required for maintenance and repairs on existing sewers.
For industry, these requirements translate into charges for remaining
pollutants which have more than tripled between 1981 and 1991 and are
expected to be twice today's level by 2000.
Households pay their share. By the end of the decade, Losem, who pays
DM1,200 of his annual taxes to help provide sewage plants, expects this
charge to double. And to implement the law on waste water treatment,
Konigswinter, with 41,000 inhabitants, will have to find an estimated DM40m
in the next two to three years to upgrade its existing sewage plant and a
further DM130m to link all households to it by 2000.
Until 1993, state subsidies covered between 30 and 40 per cent of investment
in new plants and large infrastructure projects connected to water
management. Since the beginning of the year, these subsidies have been
abolished in most Lander (states). 'The state purses are empty. Who will pay
now?' says Wilfried Teuber, state official responsible for water management
at the federal environment ministry.
Another problem hindering lower costs is the lack of competition, explains
Teuber. Most water management in west Germany is handled by state
enterprises run by municipalities, though in the east foreign companies such
as Lyonnaise des Eaux of France tender for local contracts.
The federal environment ministry estimates that DM100bn is needed to clean
up polluted waters and implement existing anti-pollution standards in east
Germany where pollution controls were ignored in the communist era.
For Losem, the additional taxes he will have to pay for waste water
treatment add to the list of financial burdens he and other west Germans
must pay for reunification. 'The state coffers are empty because we have to
pay for east Germany as well,' he says.

FT  28 APR 93 / People: Knowles steps down from Birmingham
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Richard Knowles, leader of the Birmingham City Council, the largest
local authority in England, will retire later this year.
The feisty, cigar-smoking 75-year-old, a traditional Labour political boss
who believes in what he calls 'sensible socialism', said yesterday that he
will accept a nomination to continue as leader at an internal election next
month but will step down later.
Knowles departs as the political tide in Birmingham has begun to swing
against Labour which has been in power, under his leadership, since 1984.
During this period he fended off opposition from ideologues on the party
left and fought an unsuccessful campaign to stop Conservative attempts,
especially under the then Mrs Thatcher, to reduce the power of the town
halls.
He has always worked at the grassroots of the Labour movement, becoming an
organiser in 1950, and nursed the safe Sparkbrook seat in Birmingham for Roy
Hattersley, the former Labour deputy leader.

FT  28 APR 93 / People: Jonathan Charkham to retire
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jonathan Charkham, a leading authority on corporate governance both in this
country and abroad, is retiring at the end of June from his position as
adviser on industry to the governor of the Bank of England
A barrister by training, 62-year-old Charkham had been at the Bank for
twelve years. His first task was a secondment to set up ProNed, the
organisation aiming to promote the role of non-executive directors. He
returned in 1985 to take up his current assignment.
A member of the Cadbury Committee, his international reputation was
underscored last year when he became the only foreigner to sit on the US
President's sub-council on Corporate Governance and Financial Markets.
After the Bar, Charkham spent 15 years at the family firm Morris Charkham,
before moving to Whitehall where he was later responsible for setting up the
Public Appointments Unit, the central advisory body service in this field
for civil servants.
He has written a book 'Keeping Good Company' dealing with corporate
governance in Germany, Japan, France, the US and UK, which is due to appear
at the beginning of next year.
Charkham is not being directly replaced within the Bank. Instead, director
Pen Kent will become the senior point of contact with industry, with both
the new governor, Eddie George, and the new deputy, Rupert Pennant-Rea, also
taking a keen interest.

FT  28 APR 93 / Management: From coal mine to chicken litter - Job prospects
for pit managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As an employee of British Coal for 22 years, Ian Clayton never expected to
work with any fuel other than that which had fired an industrial revolution
and countless imaginations.
He was wrong; last week he started a new job as the manager of an
electricity-generating plant where the raw material is chicken litter, a
combination of wood shavings and excreta.
'It may not be everyone's idea of fun but I am enjoying it and I feel the
future is secure here,' he says.
Clayton, 45, is one of a growing number of British Coal pit managers who are
opting out of the industry as they see the number of pits declining and
their job prospects reduce with them.
Compared with face workers and other less skilled British Coal employees,
pit managers are finding jobs, if not easily then with less of a struggle.
Finding jobs for senior staff is a relatively new problem for British Coal.
Although it has been shrinking for many years, it has been able to shed
staff voluntarily through relatively generous redundancy packages. But
earlier retrenchments mean that most candidates for early retirement, which
becomes available when employees reach 50, have already gone.
The destinations of those departing are surprisingly varied. They include
teaching, general management and consultancy work.
Many have increased their salaries, not surprising given that the average
salary for a pit manager, in charge of perhaps 800 staff, is less than
Pounds 50,000. British Coal departees often feel a sense of release from an
employer which offers only limited career opportunities because of its
contraction.
Take 36-year-old Kevin Whiteman, who left his job as manager of Frickley pit
in February to become southern region manager for the National Rivers
Authority. The problem at British Coal, he says, was not so much lack of
security even though the pit he managed is only reprieved from closure if
British Coal can find a market for its coal.
'I was concerned about the shortage of opportunities,' says Whiteman. 'I had
been a pit manager for the best part of eight years and I could see few
places to go within British Coal. The management challenges here are very
similar - general management is general management.'
The NRA job was the first Whiteman had applied for and, says Peter
Humphreys, personnel director, he beat 300 other applicants for the
appointment. 'We wanted someone whose qualities and experience included
financial control, an engineering and management background, and a
well-defined knowledge of operating with high public visibility. Kevin was
the outstanding candidate.'
Clayton, former manager at British Coal's Silverhill pit, contested with a
smaller field of candidates to win his job as manager of the Fibropower
chicken litter power station in Eye, Suffolk. The 65 contenders, though,
included senior employees of National Power power stations.
Nor was Clayton the only coal industry candidate to impress. Three British
Coal employees made it to the final interview stage.
That does not surprise Philip Andrew, chief executive at British Coal
Enterprise. It is his job to find work for British Coal employees who want
to move on, so he is hardly likely to run down their abilities, but he is
frank about some of their potential deficiencies.
'If you asked a pit manager to go to the City for debt funding to deal with
working capital he would not know what you were talking about,' he says.
'But they are very much aware of profit and their general management skills
are strong. We are talking about people who handle 700 to 800 personnel and
a business turning over Pounds 40m a year. Many managing directors of
publicly quoted companies have less on their plate than that.'

FT  28 APR 93 / Management: The practice of equal pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Equal pay for equal work, while easy to grasp in theory is elusive in
practice.
Applying the concept of equality to deferred pay - pensions - has proved so
difficult that three years after a landmark ruling from the European Court
of Justice employers are still unclear about how to make it work.
That decision, handed down on May 17 1990 in the Barber case, concluded that
employers may not offer one sex more generous pensions than are available to
the other. It immediately forced examination of pension schemes which
typically allowed women to retire on full pension at age 60, while forcing
men to wait until 65.
Today, an opinion from the Advocate General of the ECJ on a different case -
which will be subject to a final ruling later this year - should provide
further guidance for employers.
In Britain, where 80 to 90 per cent of all occupational pension payments are
made to men, employers have already responded to Barber by reducing even
further the portion of the pension pot paid to women. Figures from the
National Association of Pension Funds show that 85 per cent of all employers
have equalised male and female retirement ages within their schemes and of
these, 59 per cent have done so by raising women's ages to 65.
'The majority of employers have equalised at 65 because that is the cheapest
option,' said Kevin Spring, partner at consulting actuaries Wyatt Company.
However, the NAPF has found that most employers have been sensitive to the
views of their female employees: 82 per cent of those raising the age allow
current employees to retire earlier than that with no actuarial reduction in
pension payments. Because workers typically lose 5 per cent of their pension
for each year of early retirement, many employers have thus shielded their
female employees from a swingeing 25 per cent reduction in their pension
payments.
But employers have not solved all their problems - either legal or
managerial - by simply raising retirement ages. Thus attention is focused on
another group of cases on which the Advocate General is expected to
pronounce today. The central one comes from the UK where the pension scheme
members and trustees of Coloroll, a UK home furnishings company now in
liquidation, have asked the ECJ to resolve some outstanding questions.
First, will employers be required to provide 'retrospection' in equalising
benefits or will they just be liable for equal benefits from May 1990, the
date of the Barber judgment? Also, in so-called money purchase schemes,
where the pension consists of a single lump sum to be invested in the
purchase of an annuity, must men and women be provided with equal sums?
Moreover, in the equalisation process, can an employer legally worsen the
pension terms for employees?
'The question is whether the nature of the pension promise is sufficiently
contractual to require employers to stick to it,' said Mark Duke, principal
at actuarial consultants Towers Perrin. Employers who have tried to shield
women from the sudden effects of a change in pension age may find that the
Advocate General will require them to do the same for men retiring after May
17 1990. Given the considerable expense employers could abandon their
efforts to cushion the blow for women.
Despite the material reduction in pension benefits for women post Barber,
benefits consultants say there has been remarkably little flapping.
One reason is that relatively few women are entitled to full occupational
pensions anyway because their child care decisions typically give rise to
interrupted work patterns. Indeed, most of the outcry has come from
male-dominated trade unions who want a crack at the more generous pensions
offered to women.
Another reason, Spring says, is that fixed retirement ages are a fiction at
many companies. Employers increasingly offer flexible retirement ages,
allowing those who wish to go early the ability to do so with little or no
reduction in pension and higher pensions for those staying on longer.
Employers like flexibility because, among other things, they find an
employee hanging on only for a pension to be a relatively unproductive
worker. Employers with unhappy workers between the ages of 61 and 65 could
well be advised to consider a scheme offering both men and women a graceful
way out.

FT  28 APR 93 / Management: Stacking the odds against cancer - Health Check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DR MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EAT some cereal before you go to work; take regular apple breaks instead of
drinking coffee all day; set about making your office a smoke-free zone; and
convince your company to offer cantaloup and broccoli in the restaurant.
All these measures should lower your chances of developing certain kinds of
cancer, and stack the odds in favour of a long retirement.
Fear may stop some people from finding out about cancer. But statistically,
the chances of dying from it are much less than of dying from heart disease.
Cancer is not a single disease; it is a whole spectrum of pathologic
processes characterised by a profound disturbance in the growth and
proliferation of a cell.
In contrast to a normal cell, whose growth and reproductive cycle proceeds
in a relatively orderly manner as dictated by genetic coding, deregulated
cancer cells dominate and replace normal cells and often spread to other
parts of the body.
More than 200 forms of cancer have been identified and can be classified
into three large groups; carcinoma (deregulation of those cells that act as
lining for organs and secrete mucus), sarcoma (cancers of connective tissue
such as muscle and bone) and liquid cancer (such as leukemias).
Lung cancer is the most preventable carcinoma. Its incidence varies from
country to country. Death rates are dropping in England, Wales, Finland and
Sweden, have plateaued in Australia, Austria, the US, Belgium, Germany, the
Netherlands, New Zealand and Switzerland, and are still rising in Spain,
France, Hungary, Italy, Ireland and Poland.
The average age for developing lung cancer is 60. Once diagnosed, less than
30 per cent of patients are eligible for curative surgery, explaining in
part the dismal chances of survival, less than 10 per cent five years after
diagnosis.
The vast majority of lung cancers (around 85 per cent) are due to exposure
to tobacco smoke (either active or passive), though other substances
(asbestos, pollution, heavy metals and chloromethyltethers) have strong
causative relationships with lung cancers.
If you are unable to stop smoking entirely, you might consider a less
harmful way of getting nicotine into your system (a pipe, cigar or nicotine
patch).
Colon (large intestine) carcinoma also has links to lifestyle. It is among
the top five cancers in most developed countries, but unheard of in some
African and Asian countries.
One theory is that it is related to the longer transit time of faecal
material through the intestines in developed countries. The refined
carbohydrates in highly processed foods have less cellulose (non-absorbed
plant fibre) than in fruits and vegetables. They travel slower through the
intestines which may be conducive to inactive carcinogens turning into
active ones.
Eating more fresh fruits and vegetables, or bran cereals can help prevent
colon cancer. With the help of a qualified nutritionist, also try limiting
saturated (animal) fats to less than 25 per cent of your diet. If colon
cancer or polyps runs in your family, consult your doctor about when to have
preventative screenings.
Prostate cancer, another kind of carcinoma, is the most common malignant
tumour in men worldwide. The cause of this slow-growing tumour is unknown,
although there appears to be a hormonal relationship. It appears to be on
the increase even in areas where it was previously uncommon, such as east
and southeast Asia.
Prostate cancer is frequent in North America and Europe. Incidence and
mortality increase in Chinese and Japanese after migrating to the US.
Prostate cancer is rare before the age of 50 but then its occurence grows
steeply with age until about 80 when it begins to fall again except in
Norwegian, French and Japanese populations.
When it comes to screening, a combination of Digital Rectal Exam and a
relatively inexpensive blood test is probably the best balance between cost,
benefit and efficacy.

FT  28 APR 93 / Jobs: Don't bar the tool, blame the trainer - Complaints
that new technology encourages mental laziness are somewhat less than new
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YET again the Jobs column is appealing to readers to help to settle an
argument. This time, though, the vehement reactions when the point first
came up suggest that my view on the matter won't get anywhere near as much
support as you gave me when I last made such an appeal 13 weeks ago.
On that occasion the issue was whether a certain psychological test was
right to regard disdain for the conversation of 'ordinary, habit-bound
conventional people' as a mark of creative intelligence. A handsome 95 per
cent of your responses agreed that, by and large, it wasn't.
Today's issue is more directly practical. It arose at a gathering held at
Nottingham University a few days ago by the central body serving the
associations of former students of the United Kingdom's universities - the
Conference of University Convocations and Graduate Associations.
The initial session could well have been sub-titled 'From the sublime to the
ridiculous'. The opening two speakers were both eminent academics. The first
was Professor Gareth Williams of London University. The second was Dr Bill
Newton-Smith of Oxford, now also taking a leading part in the creation of
the new Central European University funded by George Soros. Both were
largely optimistic about the future of higher educational institutions.
Then came the Jobs column, which was less so.
But the argument that needs to be settled didn't arise from what any of us
said in our set-piece speeches. It boiled up in the discussion afterwards
when, to a question on educational methods, I replied critically by citing
the case of a colleague who, as well as strumming a keyboard part-time as a
journalist, is taking a full-time degree course.
On starting it, wishing to be sure her home computer's software was
compatible with the college's system, she asked her tutor which
word-processing program was in use. His response was to warn her against
relying on a computer when producing her student essays.
The reason, he said, was that in all her examinations she would have to work
in long-hand. She would therefore be wise to keep her fist in for protracted
stints of pen-pushing.
Now that strikes me as a wasteful requirement. True, the development of
handwriting skill is essential in education's earlier stages, and it remains
the simplest means of framing shortish communications throughout life. But
the practice of churning out thousands of words in long-hand over periods of
hours is surely obsolescent.
While there is no harm in folk doing it as a labour of love (as they might
make wooden cart-wheels), to force it on students at university level is a
different matter. Given their increasingly probable need to use a keyboard
in the business of earning their living, they'd be better occupied in
developing the requisite skills as part of their studies.
So I upped and said as much to the conference.
Whereupon nigh a hundred pairs of eyes turned evil and zeroed in on me.
Besides being awed, I was startled. Such a re-action might have been
expected if the audience had consisted entirely of academics, who can
usually be relied on to leap to the defence of their institutional habits.
But a good many of those present were business people.
Mercifully, instead of leaving me to be savaged, Bill Newton-Smith promptly
riposted that if he had his way, except in subjects where computers are now
indispensable, students would be barred from using word-processors for their
course-work. At which a large part of the mob broke into spontaneous
applause.
The reason he gave, which also drew approval, was that the toil of writing
long-hand concentrates the mind on producing succinct and disciplined
results. By contrast, computer technology tends to blind students to the
need to apply hard and deep thought to a question, by making it easier for
them just to smother it with large numbers of words.
Despite being taken aback, I was disposed to argue in detail that it ain't
necessarily so. In the event, given that the consensus of the meeting was
against me and that people were impatient to move to other topics, I
refrained - which might give my return to the argument from the safety of a
newspaper office the mien of a double act of cowardice.
Even so, on reflection, it seems worse just to let the issue drop. For I
doubt that the long-hand lobbyists' case is as strong as their commitment to
it is fierce.
Take for instance Dr Newton-Smith's claim that word-processors encourage
mental laziness. It is far from the first time that such charges have been
made against an important technical advance.
Even the first invention of lettering, enabling us to write things down
instead of storing them in our heads, was criticised on similar grounds by
Plato in the last part of the Phaedrus some 2,400 years ago.
In it, he has the supposed inventor of letters go before his king, boasting
that the result would be to make people 'wiser, and better able to
remember'. To which the king replies:
'. . . you, as being the father of letters, have ascribed to them now in
your fondness exactly the reverse of their real effects. For this invention
of yours will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn it, by
causing them to neglect their memory inasmuch as, from their confidence in
writing, they will recollect by the external aid of foreign symbols, and not
by the internal use of their own faculties. Your discovery, therefore, is a
medicine not for memory, but for recollection - for recalling to, not for
keeping in mind.
'And you are providing for your disciples a show of wisdom without the
reality. For, acquiring by your means much information unaided by
instruction, they will appear to possess much knowledge, while in fact they
will for the most part know nothing at all; and, moreover, be disagreeable
people to deal with, as having become wise in their own conceit, instead of
truly wise.'
Oddly enough, I have not heard anyone recently urging that students be
barred from taking notes and reading written texts. So perhaps the effects
have turned out less bad than the long-hand lobby's ancient precursor
feared. Nor do I see why the results need be worse where word-processors are
concerned.
Any tool can be used either wisely or foolishly, and there is nothing in the
tool itself that decides which of the two will be the case. The decisive
factor would seem to be whether the wise application is trained into the
users by their educators.
If people capable of giving such training are scarce in the universities,
there's certainly no lack of them in certain places elsewhere. The printable
name for them is 'editors'.
The archetypal models react to an unacceptable piece of writing by waiting
until the deadline is sickeningly close, then throwing it back at you with
the command to re-write it because it is wrong.
There's no use asking why it is wrong. Even if they'd time to tell you, they
probably do not know. All they know is that it is wrong, and that's that.
You have no choice but to find out why for yourself and set things right.
As a learning method, that is surely more effective than not just writing
the piece out long-hand, but carving it in stone.

FT  28 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Limit on business rate rise gives
Pounds 350m 'boost'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBIN SQUIRE, junior environment minister, told the Commons last night
that business would receive a Pounds 350m boost in the current financial
year as a result of uniform business rate increases being limited to 3.6 per
cent.
The non-domestic rating bill, which for the second successive year freezes
business rates in real terms, was given a general welcome and an unopposed
second reading.
Mr John Redwood, minister for local government, said that about 250,000
shops and offices - mainly in the south of England - would benefit from the
bill to the tune of more than Pounds 190m.
About 85,000 factories and warehouses - mainly in the north - would also
benefit from reductions worth more than Pounds 30m.
Mr Redwood explained that a further 165,000 properties would gain relief
worth Pounds 120m, while businesses in Wales would save about Pounds 9m. The
total cost was estimated to be Pounds 350m in 1993-94 and Pounds 225m in the
following year.
Comparable reductions in Scotland would be introduced by regulations.
Mr Redwood disclosed that more than 525,000 of the 633,000 appeals made
against the 1990 revaluation had been settled. Valuation tribunals were on
target to clear the remainder by the end of the current financial year.
Looking forward to the new revaluation based on property values on April 1
this year and due to take effect in 1995, he said rental values in depressed
sectors were likely to be 'significantly lower'.
Mr Redwood told the House that if this proved to be the case rateable values
would fall and some businesses still benefiting from transitional relief
next year might never have to face the full rate liabilities implied by the
1990 valuations.
Mr Doug Henderson, chief Labour spokesman in the debate, urged the
government to take account of the views expressed by some in the business
community that there would be advantages in restoring to local councils some
say in determining business rates.

FT  28 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maxwell trustees seek claimants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRUSTEES to the Maxwell pension funds have still not traced 10 per cent
of the pensioners who may be entitled to payments, the Commons social
security committee was told yesterday.
But they have so far spent more than Pounds 4m in professional and legal
fees relating to the administration and litigation involving the pension
funds.
The details emerged during questioning from MPs, as former Maxwell employees
demonstrated outside Parliament to highlight concerns about the diminishing
amount of money available to pay their pensions.
Mr Jeremy Corbyn MP said it was 'astonishing' that so many potential
pensioners had not been traced, while pointing out that 'a great deal of
money has been paid out in fees to all the trustees'.
The trustees to the schemes said they had attempted to trace other
pensioners through a Department of Social Security service, but blamed their
difficulties on poor administration of the schemes while they were
controlled by the late Robert Maxwell.
Clay &amp; Partners, trustees to the private Maxwell companies, said it had
spent Pounds 1.3m in legal and professional fees by the end of last year.
MGN Pension Trustees, responsible for the Mirror Group pensioners, had spent
Pounds 1.7m on legal costs by January 15 this year. Law Debenture Trust,
trustees to the Maxwell Communication Pension Plan, had spent Pounds 923,000
by the end of December. All these figures excluded value added tax.
The trustees also expressed concerns that more than Pounds 75m in insurance
cover against fraud could be in jeopardy. They said the insurers were
claiming the policies were void because they had not been notified that
alleged frauds were already taking place.
At the Maxwell pensioners' rally Mr Ken Trench, chairman of the Maxwell
Pensioners' Action Group, criticised the government for its short-term
approach, which he said was using emergency funding to pay current pensions
and took no account of future hardship payments.
Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP for Birkenhead who chairs the social security
committee, told the pensioners rally that he believed there was 'light at
the end of the tunnel'.
He said the trustees now showed 'guarded optimism' that within a five-year
period money would come in from various sources 'to pay the vast majority'
of pensioners and those still to retire their due.

THE FIRST new employees to be recruited under the government's Pounds 2.6m
Workstart programme should start work by June, Mrs Gillian Shephard,

FT  28 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Concerns on N Sea oil tax to be
heard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has told MPs it will listen to their concerns about its
controversial proposals for reforming the North Sea tax regime to see if
improvements can be made. But ministers remain convinced they have found the
best plan possible, David Owen writes.
Treasury ministers have indicated they will look at suggestions for
providing some transitional relief for oil companies affected by the changes
which were proposed in the Budget.
Under the proposals the rate at which petroleum revenue tax is levied would
fall from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and tax relief would be abolished for
exploratory drilling.
Many companies say these plans would lead to a halving of exploration
activity and the loss of up to 40,000 jobs.
Mr John Butterfill, a senior Tory backbencher, this week tabled a set of
amendments to the Finance Bill designed to maintain tax relief for
exploration work to which the industry is already committed.
Labour has also made clear its objections to the government's proposals,
saying it thinks it is 'fundamentally wrong' to abandon the PRT system 'at
the present time'.
Mr Alistair Darling, a frontbench Treasury spokesman, intends to use a
Commons debate early next month to press this viewpoint.

FT  28 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Little appetite for diet of
military involvement - Philip Stephens considers the issues facing
Conservatives over the civil war in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   by PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LADY THATCHER caught the moment. But it was only a moment. As the government
contemplates acquiescence in US-led military action against Serbia it is
being warned quietly but firmly by its supporters at Westminster against
dragging Britain into the bloody civil war in Bosnia.
The outrage and frustration at Serbian atrocities against the Bosnian
Moslems which Lady Thatcher articulated 10 days ago have not disappeared.
They will be rekindled by the latest offensive against the Moslem enclave of
Bihac.
If Serbia reacts to the tightening of sanctions by seizing the besieged town
of Srebrenica the former prime minister may be able to claim another moment.
But as Conservative MPs have contemplated more carefully the implications of
western air strikes or the lifting of the international arms embargo, their
rage has been tempered by the harsher military and political realities.
The savagery of the Croatian latest attacks on Moslem villages has reminded
them that it is a three-sided civil war with no clear front lines to defend,
no ready-made safe havens to be protected. No-one believes the Vance-Owen
peace plan could be imposed by force. Soundings in their constituencies have
persuaded MPs that the nation's anger at the atrocities shown nightly on
television news has yet to translate into a willingness to see British
soldiers fight and die in an attempt to impose peace.
Nor is the Labour party speaking with one voice. Mr John Smith's public
backing for limited air attacks on Serbian supply lines in Bosnia has won
far-from-universal support among his frontbench colleagues. No-one is
questioning it publicly but some are dismayed, others are furious.
If Mr John Major judges, as is likely, that the transatlantic alliance
demands that he stands beside President Bill Clinton then the odds are that
his party will rally round. There is a deep-seated tradition in the
Conservative party that the government must be supported during
international crises and the Nato alliance is guarded preciously.
But, with the exception of a handful who have called consistently for
military intervention, it is difficult to detect any enthusiasm for such a
policy on the Tory back benches. Instead there is a determination to ensure
the government draws a firm line beyond which it will never step.
Mr Michael Jopling, a former chief whip, sums up the mood: 'Everybody is
frustrated, everybody is horrified. The question, though, is what is best'.
The lesson from past conflicts is that air strikes will achieve little. Mr
Jopling's question is rhetorical: 'Is the advantage of bombing cancelled out
by a halt to humanitarian aid?'
His scepticism is echoed by Mr Tim Renton, another respected figure on the
back benches: 'We have to accept this is a civil war . . The idea that we
can bomb the Serbs into better behaviour is totally unrealistic'.
In private conversations other prominent backbenchers are more forthright.
It would be 'lunacy' says one, for Britain to risk being drawn into a
conflict: '(Lady) Thatcher said what I would have loved to. But I don't
believe a word of it.'
Reluctant acceptance that limited air strikes may be inevitable is coupled
with an insistence that British ground forces must not become involved in
the fighting. If there is the slightest risk that bombing will make them a
target for Serbian attacks, the existing forces must be withdrawn
immediately. There can be no question of large-scale reinforcement.
For Mr Douglas Hurd, the mood is at once helpful and dangerous. The foreign
secretary is less than popular among those seeking a military solution. Lady
Thatcher described his argument against lifting the arms embargo - it would
create a level killing field - as disgraceful.
The once-young fogeys on the fringes of the Tory right who believe that
western force is all that is needed to re-establish order in the Balkans see
Mr Hurd as the symbol of establishment appeasement.
But his strong opposition to removal of the arms embargo - and his
commonsense observation that it could not be lifted only for the Moslems -
is widely shared among Conservative and Labour MPs.
The general view is it might salve temporarily European consciences but that
it would increase greatly the level of suffering. The humanitarian aid
effort would not survive the inevitable escalation in the conflict.
The foreign secretary's careful refusal over several months to discount the
possibility of the west being pushed into military action has left him in
front of, rather than behind, the opinion in his party. His weekend decision
to commit British forces to the defence of the Canadian peace-keeping troops
in Srebrenica did the same. Most of his cabinet colleagues - Mr Malcolm
Rifkind the most important - are also more cautious.
Mr Hurd is far from enthusiastic about air strikes. He has stressed
repeatedly his belief that in the end there will be no alternative to a
political agreement. He wants more time for the tougher sanctions regime to
take effect. Guaranteeing order in the former Yugoslavia, as he puts it,
would impose huge risks over an indefinite period. The risks could not be
justified to the people of Britain. If he acquiesces in a decision by
Washington to press ahead regardless it will be with great reluctance. The
Conservative party will be more reluctant still.

FT  28 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Councils to change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNTY councillors elected on May 6 will find the councils they run changing
rapidly with the growth in compulsory competitive tendering, John Willman
writes.
Since 1988, services such as grounds maintenance and catering services have
been subject to tendering. By the time of the next elections, white-collar
services in information technology, finance, personnel, construction and
corporate services will also have been put out to tender.
The majority of contracts have been won by council workforces. But
contracting-out forces councils to put operations on a more businesslike
footing and make a 5 per cent rate of return on capital.
Labour remains opposed to tendering in principle, although it appears to be
relaxing its opposition following last year's election defeat. Labour
councils have found the threat of contracting-out helpful in persuading
employees to increase the effic-iency and quality of services.
Some councils, including Berkshire, have decided to go further than required
in contracting out all but core activities.
None has yet reached the state envisioned by the late Lord Ridley who
foresaw local authorities meeting once a year to hand out contracts for the
whole range of council services. But the 'enabling council', which sees its
role as buying services and ensuring high standards, is here to stay.

FT  28 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs warn on risks of rail
privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMONS transport committee yesterday labelled the government's rail
privatisation plans 'novel and untested' and warned that they could go badly
wrong.
The committee's final report on the government's proposals said investment
was more important to the railways' future than whether they were
privatised.
But MPs stopped short of condemning the privatisation plans outright, saying
they might hold the potential for an improved system.
'Rail users will be the final judge of whether the legislation currently
before the House succeeds in maintaining the opportunities for private
profit,' they concluded.
A hostile report had been expected because the transport committee is
chaired by anti-privatisation Conservative MP Mr Robert Adley. But the
strongest criticisms appear to have been toned down to secure the backing of
other Conservative members.
The report broadly approves the government's plans for rail freight
privatisation but expresses reservations about the idea of open access to
the tracks for competing passenger-train operators and the separation of
ownership of the tracks and trains. It says budgetary constraints could lead
to line closures.
The committee says no comparable railway in the world has adopted the form
of privatisation proposed for the UK. 'This does not of itself mean that it
cannot succeed,' the report says. 'What it does mean is that because of the
lack of previous experience to draw upon, the risk that something could go
badly wrong is that much higher.'
Mr Roger Freeman, public transport minister, said there was no reason why
any services should close as a result of privatisation. 'The only services
that will close, and I am sure that will happen, are those that close
because of lack of passenger demand. But I don't want to go down in history
as the junior minister who was the grandson of Beeching.'
Mr Freeman said many of the other criticisms had been overtaken by events
and he undertook to respond to the others before the Railways Bill reached
report stage.
Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said the MPs' report showed
that the nation would end up with 'a lawyers' paradise and a passengers'
hell'.
The government plans to press ahead with a bill to privatise London's buses
as part of a strategy to put consumer choice and deregulation at the heart
of its next legislative programme.
Whitehall officials said yesterday that Mr MacGregor had secured a place for
the bill in the programme for the Queen's Speech which will be endorsed by
the cabinet tomorrow.

FT  28 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Councillors share credit for
economies - An unusual accord in Berkshire's county council elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN approach to council services more radical than that put forward by
central government does not seem a likely way of taking the politics out of
local politics: yet that is what Berkshire county council's policy of
'externalisation' has done so far in the county council elections.
The largely non-partisan in-itiatives in Berkshire have enabled councillors
of all parties to benefit by sharing the credit for making savings to
provide extra money for services used by the public.
From the late 1980s, the Tory administration kept a couple of steps ahead of
the Department of the Environment's prescriptive regime for compulsory
competitive tendering of blue- and white-collar services, by voluntarily
letting out contracts before central government told it how to do it.
When the Tories lost control to a non-Conservative consensus last May, that
policy was continued. Earlier this month the coalition of Labour, Liberal
Democrat and independent councillors who together can beat the Tories by
just one vote, announced that it was contracting out its finance services
and that an employee buy-out backed by Touche Ross, the accountancy firm,
was the preferred contractor.
In March the council awarded what it believes to be the largest contract
ever from a local authority - worth more than Pounds 30m in fees - when the
Babtie group, engineering consultants, took over the county's highways and
planning services, along with over 300 of the department's 383 staff.
Mr Tony Allen, Berkshire's chief executive, says a combination of factors
led to the change. 'We've been under continuous budget pressure  - for four
years we have been up against the capping limit, having to make big savings.
The parties were open-minded on ways of putting money into frontline
services.'
Councillors of all persuasions emphasise the progress in reducing waste and
improving the quality of services, by building up a relationship with a
private sector partner company rather than by simply taking the lowest cash
bid.
Mr Gareth Gimblett, the leader of the Tory group, says that the process puts
councillors in a better position to monitor services than when the authority
is both purchaser and provider. 'There is far greater control of service
delivery than when the council is delivering the service,' he argues.
Mr Lawrence Silverman, the leader of the Labour group, sees the move as in
line with the Labour leadership's relaxed attitude about the distinction
between public and private sectors.
Though there has been some grumbling from local government trade unions, he
admits, they recognise that transferring to the private sector is preferable
to losing jobs.
The wide political consensus on the issue does not extend indefinitely,
however.
A re-formed Liberal Democrat and Labour administration would probably
conclude the initiative had just about reached its limits.
By contrast, a Tory-controlled Berkshire, would look at contracting out more
direct services, such as some aspects of social services and libraries and
cutting back further the education services still provided by Shire Hall.
But for the present, the advantages of externalisation are so undisputed
that it is an issue in the campaign only insofar that one or another party
is accused of not pursuing it strongly enough.

FT  28 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Civil servants call for code of
ethics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNION representing Whitehall's top civil servants yesterday called for
an independent commission of inquiry to examine the relationship between the
Civil Service and ministers.
The First Division Association told the cross-party Commons Treasury and
Civil Service committee the commission should draft a code of ethics to
strengthen the political neutrality of the ser-vice.
Ms Elizabeth Symons, FDA general secretary, said public confidence in the
Civil Service had been shaken by events such as the sale of arms to Iraq
revealed in the Matrix-Churchill trial, sterling's departure from the
European exchange rate mechanism and the pit closure fiasco.
A code would set out the rules governing relationships between civil
servants and ministers, Ms Symons said.
The conventions under which the Civil Service had operated since the last
century needed updating following a decade of radical managerial reform in
the Civil Service.
An independent ombudsman was needed, she said, to whom civil servants could
appeal when they believed they had been asked to work outside normal Civil
Service rules.
Ms Symons said the union regularly received complaints from members about
things they had been asked to do. In most cases, members were unwilling to
use the current appeal procedure which requires them to raise complaints
with their managers.
MPs also heard a call to introduce renewable, fixed-term contracts for top
policymaking civil servants from Mr Graham Mather, president of the European
Policy Forum, a free-market think tank.

THE FIRST new employees to be recruited under the government's Pounds 2.6m
Workstart programme should start work by June, Mrs Gillian Shephard,
employment secretary, told MPs yesterday.
Answering questions in the Commons, Mrs Shephard promised that monitoring of
the four initial Workstart pilot schemes would be 'very close.' Contracts
would stipulate that individuals hired under Workstart must be additional to
a company's existing workforce.
The scheme - announced in the Budget - will give employers a government
subsidy of Pounds 60 a week for taking on the long-term jobless.

FT  28 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major and Smith clash on testing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIME MINISTER John Major yesterday rejected Labour demands to suspend this
year's school tests, while appearing to acknowledge that some of the
concerns voiced by 'ordinary teachers' were justified, David Owen writes.
Challenged repeatedly by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, Mr Major
emphasised the importance ministers attached to the principle of testing and
denounced teachers who thought it appropriate to take industrial action at
the expense of this year's exams for seven and 14-year-olds.
But he said the government was 'considering and responding to' the concerns
of teachers who simply wanted less bureaucracy.
Mr Smith urged the government to 'for once listen' to the considered
judgement of the whole teaching profession and to suspend the tests.
He called on Mr John Patten, the education secretary, to recognise he had
lost the argument. He said: 'This increasingly bitter dispute is not about
the principle of sensible testing but about the dogmatic insistence of an
arrogant education secretary that his view must prevail against that of
governors, teachers and parents.'

FT  28 APR 93 / Wellcome transfers Dollars 400m to US trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WELLCOME Trust, the largest UK medical charity, is to transfer Dollars
400m (Pounds 260m) to its smaller sister organisation in the US over the
next five years, Clive Cookson writes.
The gift to the Burroughs Wellcome Fund may disappoint some British
researchers who had counted on receiving all the money the trust received
after last July's sale of its majority stake in Wellcome, the drugs company.
Mr Roger Gibbs, chairman of the Wellcome Trust, said it was the governors'
prime duty 'to interpret the will and wishes of the founder Sir Henry
Wellcome', who was born and educated in the US. 'We believe it would be Sir
Henry's fervent wish that the trust should make a significant contribution
to medical research in the US.'
Dr Bridget Ogilvie, director, said the gift would amount to about 5 per cent
of the trust's total asset base - Pounds 5.4bn at current stock prices.
Because it was a transfer of capital and would not be paid out of current
income, the gift would not affect immediately the grants to UK researchers,
which have been rising rapidly for several years and will be about Pounds
140m this year.
Dr Ogilvie said there was also a message to politicians in the UK: 'It's not
our duty to save British science - that's the government's duty.'
The total spending of the Wellcome Trust and smaller medical charities has
overtaken that of the state-funded Medical Research Council, which spends
about Pounds 200m a year on grants.
The gift will transform the fortunes of the Burroughs Wellcome Fund - which
has a capital base of only Dollars 35m, disbursing Dollars 4m a year in
grants - into one of the top 50 non-profit foundations in the US over the
next five years.
The fund's directors have not yet decided how to spend the money, but it is
expected to concentrate on giving grants to promising young researchers and
to research into neglected areas such as parasitology.

FT  28 APR 93 / Council to target inward investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHUMBERLAND County Council is to use its super-annuation fund investments
as a means of trying to attract potential inward investors to its area.
About 50 per cent of the Pounds 250m fund is invested in UK equities, with
another 20 per cent in equity stakes in companies in north America, Europe,
Japan and the Pacific Basin.
The council is now to target some of these businesses, inviting them to
consider the county as a base.
Mr Ken Morris, its chief executive, said yesterday: 'That relationship is a
powerful calling-card. It's much easier to knock on the door of a potential
investor as a shareholder than as a salesman.'
The initiative, he said, would not influence the fund's investment policy,
which is to try to secure the best possible return. Mr Morris said the
council would not invest in companies in order to encourage them to locate
in Northumberland.
The council will target companies in pharmaceuticals, electronics,
engineering and automotive supply.
Its fund managers, Barings Investment Management and Mercury Asset
Management, are to identify businesses with growth potential in these
sectors among its existing equity investments. Council economic development
officers will then approach the companies.

FT  28 APR 93 / Lawyers improve advice to suspects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SCHEME to prevent suspects at police stations receiving incompetent legal
advice is to be launched by the Law Society and the Legal Aid Board, Robert
Rice writes.
From October 1994 the board will pay solicitors' representatives for police
station work only if they have passed an independent test.
The move follows widespread concern about the standard of advice being given
to suspects. Research has shown that fewer than one in four people in police
custody who requested legal advice saw a solicitor and that solicitors'
repre-sentatives were often inexperienced and lacked proper training.
Under the scheme solicitors' representatives who have not passed the test or
who have not sought accreditation will have six months to develop their
skills while dealing with less serious cases.

FT  28 APR 93 / PM plea on terror cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday urged cross-party support for the government's aid
scheme for insurance against terrorist attacks as the City's security came
under growing scrutiny in the wake of Saturday's bombing.
Mr Major was speaking ahead of a meeting today with Sir Francis McWilliams,
lord mayor of London, to discuss improvements to security measures.
The lord mayor is expected to raise the question of whether policing levels
in the City should be raised, although he will also point out that, like
other local authorities, the Corporation of London is limited by
rate-capping legislation.
Large banks and other companies in the City are expected to increase
pressure for a review of security at a meeting with Sir Francis tomorrow
evening. The meeting, due to be attended by the heads of more than 20 of the
largest banks in the City, was called before the bomb attack to discuss the
financial district's transport problems.
The prime minister, responding to pressure for a review of security
following the attack, refused to rule out the introduction of an identity
card system. But he added: 'I have to say that it is not immediately on our
agenda.'
Mr Major said legislation on the terrorist insurance scheme would be debated
by MPs 'as soon as possible'.
Government business managers expect the terrorist insurance legislation to
become law well before MPs rise for the summer recess. Labour last night
appeared unlikely to oppose the bill.
In the Commons, Mr Major said cover under the scheme, announced last year by
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, had been provided since
January 1. He reiterated that the government would honour its commitments
under the scheme.
Mr Major said: 'The government scheme is one of reinsurance for the
industry. Those who suffered damage will need to make their claims to their
insurers in the usual way.'
Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, told the bank's
annual general meeting that NatWest had achieved 'business as usual'.

FT  28 APR 93 / Insurance profits fear hits CU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS ABOUT the effect of the bomb damage on the profits of Commercial
Union, one of the UK's leading insurers, hit its share price yesterday.
Initial indications are, however, that the rest of the insurance industry
will lose less from this attack than it did after the bombs of last April.
Commercial Union, which leads coverage on NatWest Tower, said it was
'unlikely to lose less' than the Pounds 15m paid out last year. Its shares
fell 15p yesterday to close at 593p.
Others expect to be less badly hit. Sun Alliance said total net losses were
unlikely to exceed Pounds 15m, compared with Pounds 39m last year. General
Accident is forecasting a loss of less than Pounds 7m. Guardian Royal
Exchange and Royal Insurance expect to lose less than Pounds 5m.
Differences in reinsurance arrangements explain the contrasting outlook. The
main exposures of the companies stem from policies underwritten in 1992,
before terrorism was excluded from standard commercial policies.
Both Royal Insurance and Guardian Royal Exchange bought reinsurance policies
from Pool Re, the government-backed reinsurance company.
Sun Alliance and General Accident bought extra reinsurance from alternative
sources. Commercial Union has less comprehensive reinsurance.
The figures indicate that the government and reinsurance companies will bear
the brunt of the bill, estimated at between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m.

THE Corporation of London said last night that it had launched an effort to
help small businesses affected by the bomb.
About 150 shops and other small businesses were affected by the blast.
Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the corporation's policy committee, said:
'Our small-business unit is helping them find alternative premises or
putting them in touch with firms who can repair and fit out their damaged
premises.
'The City is the world's leading international financial centre but it could
not survive without the support of the many small businesses - sandwich
bars, dry-cleaners, heel bars, stationers - which City workers rely on.'
The corporation will provide sites for small businesses that need temporary
premises. It is asking other agencies for help with temporary cabins.

FT  28 APR 93 / Police reject criticism of blast prevention policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITY of London Police mounted a robust defence yesterday of criticisms that
it might have done more to prevent Saturday's bomb.
Commander Hugh Moore, responsible for operational policing of the City,
said: 'There is nowhere in the world that has more police officers in a
square mile.'
He said the force had been the first in the country to instigate armed road
checks, which were were introduced after the Baltic Exchange bomb last year.
The last check before the latest bombing had been carried out on Friday
night.
The force has been under increasing pressure from other police forces,
politicians and anti-terrorist experts worried about whether the City's
policing is adequate to counter the terrorist threat of the IRA.
Cmdr Moore said: 'We have surveillance cameras everywhere. This lorry
(containing the bomb) was seen on surveillance cameras but it doesn't help
you. Of course it helps you afterwards but it's no use at the time. Your
camera doesn't arrest people.
'The only way to prevent bombings is to stop the vehicle en route because
once it gets into position with the bomb set you can't do much about it
unless a bomb expert can get into it and defuse it.'
He was speaking after Mr John Burrow, the president of the Association of
Chief Constables, asked for authority to mount roadblocks if forces
considered there was a security risk.
At present police are allowed to carry out spot checks only if they have
reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed. Any extension would
need to be approved by parliament.
Details emerged yesterday of the extent to which the IRA had wrong-footed
MI5 and police throughout the country.
The IRA operation leading to the bomb was was well under way on March 20
when the tipper truck used in the attack was stolen.
Ten hours before the bomb went off a message, based on MI5 intelligence and
circulated by Special Branch to all 43 police forces around the country,
could not be more specific than to request greater vigilance because of the
'heightened threat of terrorist attack'.
Neither MI5 nor Special Branch was able to pinpoint a time, target, or city.
It is thought that if the message had been able to do so the IRA would
almost certainly have aborted its bombing operation.
One police source said yesterday: 'We have had that sort of message many
times before this year and it has not always led to a bomb going off.'
Mr Barry Sheerman, Labour's frontbench spokesman on the disabled, who spent
four years as the party's spokesman on home affairs, said that the bomb was
further evidence that a national police force was needed on the lines of the
US Federal Bureau of Investigation to tackle the IRA.
Professor Paul Wilkinson, an anti-terrorist expert based at St Andrews
University, said the weekend bomb had demonstrated a lack of co-ordinated
police response.
It had, he said, also showed that the City of London police did not have the
resources to deal with the terrorist threat.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has been given two months to respond to European Commission
objections to plans for an east London river crossing, which will cut
through the 8,000-year-old Oxleas Wood.
If the government does not give a satisfactory response it will face action
in the European Court of Justice.
Environmentalists and Euro-MPs campaigning to save Oxleas Wood are worried
that if the government insists on going to court, work on the road may start
before the case can be resolved.
Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the EC environment commissioner, told campaigners
yesterday that he had sent London a 'reasoned opinion' last week, laying out
Brussels' complaints.
The Commission believes the government should have carried out an assessment
of the plan's environmental impact, in line with EC legislation, before
deciding the line of the new road. The Department of the Environment has
always claimed that the Oxleas Wood procedure started before the EC
directive came into force, and that the environmental concerns were taken
into account.
The Commission announced in January that it was not satisfied with the
government's reply to its initial letter.
EC action to halt the project is almost the last hope of campaigners, whose
legal challenge to the work was defeated in the British High Court in
February.
Mr Paleokrassas met interested parties yesterday to discuss the issue. But
he did not mention the possibility of a European Court injunction.
Mr Peter Price, Conservative MEP for south-east London, who led the
delegation, said yesterday that he understood that advance work on the site
 -which could involve damage to the wood itself - might start early next
year, but a court judgment would be unlikely before the summer. 'I'm very
concerned about the timetable,' he said.

FT  28 APR 93 / Knight sees end of media barons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AGE of the dominant media baron was dead because of the fast-changing
structures of modern communications, Mr Andrew Knight, executive chairman of
News International, told the conference.
Growing diversity of media ownership meant no one figure could possess
overwhelming dominance, and the perception - and it was only a perception -
of the media mogul belonged to the past.
He said: 'In a market proliferating at such a rate, with access so easy and
open to all comers, domination by any one group or individual would simply
be impossible . . . The days of Lord Beaverbrook attempting to run the
country through the pages of a newspaper are long gone, and will never
return.'
Modern life was too anarchic, rich, non-conformist and wild for a
Beaverbrook, a Northcliffe or a Murdoch to dominate anything.
Mr Knight, one of Mr Rupert Murdoch's closest lieutenants, took as his theme
the strength and diversity of the media industry in the UK and the
opportunities that lay ahead for it internationally.
'We in Britain can have a bite of a trillion-pound global business . . .
but, if we are not careful, it could all slip from our grasp,' he warned.

FT  28 APR 93 / Exports lead way as optimism soars in CBI survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPORTS ARE leading the UK out of recession, but a disappointing decline in
intentions to invest in new plant and machinery could threaten the strength
of recovery.
That was the message from the Confederation of British Industry yesterday as
it released the results of its quarterly industrial trends survey.
It reported that the last four months have seen a significant increase in
demand for exports and that manufacturers expect the next few months to
bring the strongest growth in orders and output for four years. Business
optimism registered its biggest rise for 10 years.
Sir David Lees, chairman of the CBI's economic affairs committee, said: 'We
are beginning to move out of recession, with exports leading the way.'
He cautioned, however, that with many of the UK's principal export markets
in Europe falling into recession, progress could be slow.
There was also concern about investment intentions. The survey, which
covered 1,295 companies between March 26 and April 14, found that more
enterprises plan to cut expenditure on plant and machinery than to increase
it.
The highlights of the survey include:
Business optimism: The increase in business optimism was the second
consecutive rise and the sharpest since April 1983. Forty three per cent of
firms are more optimistic about the general business situation compared with
only 12 per cent saying they expect things to get worse. Orders: The
difference between those companies expecting overall demand to rise over the
next four months (31 per cent) and those expecting it to fall (11 per cent)
was the highest balance since 1989. This compares with positive balances of
13 in January and 7 in April 1992.
Export orders are expected to rise broadly in line with home demand, with a
positive balance of 18 of companies expecting an improvement, the same as in
January when the last survey was carried out.
Optimism about exports in January was reflected in a rise in export orders
over the past four months, the first increase since early 1990. Domestic
demand did not live up to expectations and fell slightly.
Prices: The squeeze on profit margins has eased slightly since the beginning
of the year as more firms have raised both domestic and export prices than
cut them.
Output: This flattened over the past four months, following sharp falls in
the 12 preceding surveys. It is now expected to rise over the next four
months. Jobs: The rate of job losses over the next four months is expected
to be the slowest for three years. But only 12 per cent of companies expect
an increase in employment, with 35 per cent expecting a fall. This is
nonetheless better than the negative balances of 35 percentage points in
January and 31 a year ago.
Stocks: The rate of destocking was reported to be at its lowest since July
1990. Further destocking is expected over the next four months.
Investment: The 24 per cent of companies expecting to spend more on plant
and machinery in the next year are outnumbered by the 32 per cent planning
to spend less. The negative balance of 8 compares with negative balances of
7 in the last survey and 10 in April last year.
The CBI said uncertainty about demand prospects and an inadequate net return
were the biggest constraints on investment. Training and innovation spending
continues to rise.
Unit costs: These have risen more slowly than was anticipated in the last
survey. They are expected to increase even more slowly in the next four
months.
Capacity: Sixty three per cent of companies now say they are working below
capacity. This was the lowest figure since January 1991.

FT  28 APR 93 / IoD looks back in anger at recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PATIENT, said Lord Young of Graffham, chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless, 'is
still in intensive care. We cannot afford any sudden shocks'.
His sober diagnosis yesterday of the fragile state of the economy found
plenty of sympathisers at the 44th annual convention of the Institute of
Directors in London.
Amid the mounting evidence this week of economic recovery - from the
government, the Confederation of British Industry and the IoD itself - there
is no sense of euphoria in the business community. There is tangible relief
and a little excitement but the official declaration that the recession is
over has been swallowed with a large dose of caution.
After all, it was one long year ago that the newly elected prime minister
appeared before the same audience to claim that economic recovery was under
way and that Britain was on the brink of a new era of prosperity. He was
repeating the message again last week.
Most of the 2,000 IoD delegates gathered at the Royal Albert Hall appeared
to believe that the worst was over. But as Mr Roger Goodwin, a Manchester
hardware supplier, put it: 'Quite a lot of people are talking up the economy
on the flimsiest of direct evidence.'
The IoD is certain that the recent, slow improvement in business confidence
is now being reflected in the statistics which really count - volumes,
profits and orders.
But as Mr Peter Morgan, IoD director-general, said before yesterday's
convention: 'We have had recessions and recoveries before but we have never
capitalised on our experience. The benefits have always been squandered.
This time, we must grab the opportunity to build a sustained, long-lasting
recovery'.
Before turning to the economic challenges ahead, there were a few scores to
be settled. The stunned satisfaction which followed Mr John Major's surprise
election victory had given way to disenchantment, even ridicule. The 'party
for business' had let business down with its macro-economic mismanagement
and it would not be allowed to forget it.
Sir Alistair Grant, chairman of Argyll Group, the food retailer, said that
the Tories had twice made fundamental economic errors - 'too strong a foot
on the accelerator in the latter part of the 1980s, too savage a foot on the
brakes in the early 1990s'. Beyond the brake and accelerator, he said, there
was the question of steering.
The slogans of free enterprise and the free market, Sir Alistair continued,
had been used since the mid 1980s as an excuse for the government's failure
to think through fundamental questions of economic and industrial policy. A
government which appeared to be 'in the grip of events' had to create broad
policy outlines as part of a 'vision of 21st-century Britain'.
Sir Alistair warned that the period of convalescence for business carried
with it many risks and he called on companies and banks to borrow and lend
sensibly, and to devise new methods of finance offering more stable funding.
Mr Morgan was also short on compliments. If recovery was finally under way,
it was 'more or less over the dead bodies of Bank of England and Treasury
officials' who had battled to keep Britain within the exchange rate
mechanism and consistently given bad advice to their political masters.
The result was that successive governments had debauched the British
currency, while manufacturing had been seriously damaged by the boom-bust
cycle. Attacking excess 'political discretion' in management of the economy,
he called for a tough, independent Bank of England to oversee a 'sound
money' policy.
But not everyone in government was cast as the villain. Mr Morgan likened
Britain to a football team which had been badly run, whose finances were a
disaster, whose players had talent but who lacked skills. Now, however, it
had a coach with a distinguished playing career. His name was 'Hezza' and,
together, Team UK could win.
The IoD delegates enjoyed the joke. They were less confident about the year
ahead.

FT  28 APR 93 / Government pledge on market testing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is determined to push ahead with its market-testing programme
in the public sector, in spite of doubts about the legal framework for
transferring employment protection undertakings to private industry, Mr
William Waldegrave, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, told the IoD
conference.
He announced a fresh initiative to publicise the programme, involving
regular publication from the summer of a market-testing contracts bulletin.
This will announce the future programmes of all government departments, and
all individual contracts as they are put out to tender.
'This bulletin will provide full information to companies who wish to
compete in our market-testing programme, and will be of particular
importance to smaller companies,' Mr Waldegrave said.
'The programme is moving forward, contracts are being let in-house and
out-house, and will result in high standards in the service delivered and
substantial savings to the taxpayer in the cost of delivery . . . It is a
rolling programme which will continue to build on achievements year by
year.'
He said if the government did not win efficiency gains in the public sector
comparable with those in private industry then the government share of gross
domestic product would increase inexorably, whether or not new public sector
commitments were taken on.
In any modern democracy, Mr Waldegrave said, the government was always going
to direct about 40 per cent of the national wealth because of spending on
defence, welfare, education, science and health. What could not be shirked
was responsibility for how that 40 per cent was managed.

FT  28 APR 93 / Wales 'expects to accelerate away from recession'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS CONFIDENCE in Wales, encouraged by rising new orders, has shown the
strongest increase since the CBI Welsh industrial trends survey started in
1978.
The CBI says the recession in Wales may be over. 'The indications are that
Wales may in fact be somewhat ahead of the UK as a whole.'
The positive balance of 35 per cent of Welsh companies which are more
optimistic this quarter compares with 22 per cent in the previous quarter.
The CBI says that much of the improvement in orders, has come from exports
but there has also been a marked increase in domestic orders. The positive
balance of 30 per cent of companies reporting overall higher orders is the
highest for five years.
There was a positive balance of 26 per cent of Welsh companies reporting
higher output, the largest increase since July 1988 and an improvement not
seen in the UK as a whole.
There is also more optimism on employment. A small positive balance of 6 per
cent of Welsh manufacturers reported that employment levels had increased
over the last quarter. Greater increases in employment are expected over the
next four months, although the CBI gives a warning that these may not
materialise because of the need to stay competitive.
The CBI says a shortage of internal finance is now the most significant
factor limiting capital expenditure authorisations over the next 12 months
and 48 per cent of Welsh companies mentioned this.
Sir Peter Phillips, chairman of the CBI Wales industrial trends panel, said
the survey suggested 'Wales manufacturing has at last turned the corner and
expects to accelerate away from recession'.

FT  28 APR 93 / Scottish industry raises confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH INDUSTRY has seen the biggest improvement in confidence for five
years, according to the CBI's industrial trends survey, accompanied by an
improvement in export orders and export deliveries.
The survey of 134 companies showed a balance of 12 per cent more optimistic
than they were four months ago.
This compares with the 31 per cent balance for the UK as a whole and
suggests that Scottish manufacturers are more cautious than their
counterparts in England and Wales.
Scottish manufacturers also reported a further fall in orders and output in
the first four months of 1993, against expectations of a small rise,
although the rate of deline was the smallest since 1990.
Mr John Ward, vice-chairman of the CBI in Scotland, said that in spite of
the improved export performance, future export prospects were tempered by
the weakening of markets in continental Europe, especially in Germany.
Europe was the traditional destination of 60 per cent of Scottish exports.
He said there were signs of a marked slowdown in unit cost increases with
better prospects for more competitive prices, especially in export markets.
Scottish manufacturers are continuing to reduce planned investment for the
year ahead with a higher proportion of Scottish businesses than in the UK as
a whole saying they will cut investment. Labour shedding has continued at a
considerable rate in the past four months.

   PALMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE package-tour industry is still struggling to emerge from recession, with
sales of summer holidays up slightly on the back of heavy discounting, says
Lunn Poly, the UK's largest travel retailer.
Lunn Poly figures published yesterday show that about 7.5m people were
expected to buy summer holidays through travel agents this year - an
increase of 5 per cent from 1992.
But Mr Richard Bowden-Doyle, Lunn Poly marketing director, said that the
average price of summer holidays sold through Lunn Poly's 610 shops this
year was Pounds 414, compared with Pounds 418 last year.
Mr Bowden-Doyle, speaking at the convention of the Association of British
Travel Agents in Majorca, said that the increase in holidays sold was the
result of discounting after Christmas, when Lunn Poly cut 10 per cent off
the prices of all its summer 1993 holidays.
Before last Christmas sales of holidays for summer 1993 had been 6 per cent
lower than the levels of the previous year.
He said that 2m winter 1992-93 holidays had been sold by travel agents, the
same as the previous year.
Lunn Poly had, however, sold holidays at a discount throughout the winter.
He said that Majorca had consolidated its position as the leading
destination for UK holidaymakers, accounting for 12 per cent of summer 1993
bookings, compared with 11 per cent last year.
Florida won 8 per cent of bookings, the same as last year, in spite of the
recent killings of European tourists and other attacks, putting it in second
place ahead of Cyprus, which has fallen from 10 per cent of bookings in 1992
to 6 per cent this year.
Turkey is in joint third place with 6 per cent, compared with 3 per cent
last year.

FT  28 APR 93 / Minister could face legal action over group failures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party has prepared the ground for a legal action against Baroness
Denton, the consumer affairs minister, to be brought by customers who suffer
from the next collapse of an unbonded travel company, Mr Nigel Griffiths,
Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, said yester-day.
He told the Association of British Travel Agents convention that Baroness
Denton and the Department of Trade and Industry had failed to provide
package travellers with the financial protection required by an EC directive
which came into force at the start of the year.
Mr Griffiths added that the proposed action was based on work carried out by
solicitors acting for customers of Land Travel, the coach com-pany which
collapsed last year.
He said a group of Land Travel customers was attempting to obtain a court
judgment against Mr Edward Leigh, then consumer affairs minister, for
failing to act on warnings from the chairman of the Boston Conservative
Club, among others, that the company was in financial trouble. Land Travel
was not an association member.
Mr Griffiths said that because non-association members were permitted under
the new regulations to arrange their own customer protection insurance,
future collapses were inevitable.
He said that trading standards officers, who are to monitor non-association
members, did not have sufficient staff to do the job.
Mr Griffiths added that it was not necessary for the government to licence
all package tour operators. It would be sufficient to licence
non-association members who sell about 1m of the 11m package tours sold in
the UK each year.

FT  28 APR 93 / L&amp;G blamed over Homes Assured
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INEFFICIENCY AND policy poaching by Legal &amp; General, the insurance company,
helped cause the collapse of Homes Assured, the mortgage broker, an Old
Bailey jury heard yesterday.
The claims were made by defence counsel in the trial of three former
directors of Homes Assured, which specialised in arranging finance for
council tenants buying their homes under the 'right to buy' scheme. The
three deny trading fraudulently.
Legal &amp; General, which had a tied-agents agreement with Homes Assured, was
'wholly incapable' of coping with the work provided by the brokers, said the
counsel for defendant Mr Keith Woodward.
Mr David Penry-Davey QC said that both Legal &amp; General and later Criterion
Insurance Company were unable to keep Homes Assured properly informed of the
proper level of policy cancellations.
The insurance company's inability to process policy applications on time
caused considerable hardship to home owners and led to further
cancellations, he said.
In addition, Legal &amp; General poached policies from Homes Assured and
actively encouraged the cancellation of many of them, he added.
'With hindsight, it is clear that the failure of the insurance companies in
notifying Homes Assured of the cancellation of insurance policies was the
main cause of the liquidation of the company,' he said.
Mr Woodward, Mr Anthony Dobson and Mr Michael Robinson all deny a joint
charge of fraudulent trading from November 1988 to August 1989.
Mr Dobson also denies two charges of procuring the execution of a valuable
security by deception, and Mr Woodward one of furnishing false information.
The trial continues today.

FT  28 APR 93 / Reprieved pits will have 'no market'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NONE OF the 12 pits reprieved by British Coal last month will find the
markets on which their future depends, a conference will hear today. And
only a couple of the 20 pits the corporation is offering for sale or lease
will be taken up by private companies.
Mr Gerard McCloskey, editor of the Financial Times International Coal
Report, says in a paper prepared for presentation to the London conference
on the coal industry that the 19 core British Coal pits will be able to
provide all the additional coal that the electricity generators and other
potential buyers need.
If any of the 12 pits remain open, he says, it will be at the expense of the
core pits, some of which may close as a result.
Mr McCloskey's analysis is the most pessimistic to have emerged since the
coal white paper, although British Coal executives say privately that they
expect to start closing some of the 12 reprieved pits by the end of next
March.
The predictions provide a gloomy background for talks between British Coal
and the electricity generators for additional coal sales. These are expected
to start in the next month but few at British Coal believe they will yield
more than 8m tonnes, less than is needed to save all 12 pits.
Mr McCloskey says the squeeze on coal will be greater than previously
expected because more gas-fired power is likely to come on stream than
analysts had thought, and the government is unlikely to force the generators
to keep stocks high. His analysis is based on generators taking an extra 10m
tonnes of coal this year and 8m next. British Coal will provide the bulk of
this.

FT  28 APR 93 / Oxford St store sold for Pounds 34.5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LEGAL &amp; GENERAL, the insurance company, has sold the DH Evans department
store in Oxford Street for Pounds 34.5m to a private German investment
company.
The deal was struck at a relatively low yield - the ratio of income to
capital value - of 7.2 per cent.
The relatively high price reflects the possibility that the building might
be partially converted into offices or smaller shop units at a later date.
The building of 335,000 sq ft is let to House of Fraser Stores on a lease
that has 90 years to run. The rent, which was settled in 1991, is Pounds
7.50 a sq ft.
