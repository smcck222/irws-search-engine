FT  28 APR 93 / Branson calls for BA chiefs to resign
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE bitter battle between British Airways and Virgin Atlantic flared up
again yesterday with Mr Richard Branson, the Virgin chairman, challenging
the highest level of BA management to resign after renewed allegations in a
television documentary that top BA directors were aware of their airline's
'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin.
Granada's World in Action claimed Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, and Mr
Robert Ayling, managing director, knew about the campaign against Virgin.
'They should either test the programme in court or they should consider
their position,' Mr Branson said, warning that he intended to issue new
writs against BA within the next two weeks.
Mr Branson said Sir Colin and Mr Ayling had consistently denied involvement
in any 'dirty tricks' campaign but the television programme had suggested
the opposite. He said: 'Either some senior people in BA are lying or they
should sue.'
Mr Branson also urged BA's non-executive directors to step in to prevent
costly new court action.
BA yesterday declined to comment on Mr Branson's remarks. After the
television programme on Monday night, BA said it had no comment to make,
adding that 'if sued, we shall deal with these matters in court'.

FT  28 APR 93 / ITC chief warns on pursuit of ratings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDEPENDENT Tele-vision Commission yesterday warned both ITV and Channel
4 not to go too far in the pursuit of ratings at the expense of programme
obligations.
Mr David Glencross, ITC chief executive, said that although the start of the
new ITV licences had gone better than expected there were still areas of
concern. He said viewers of religious programmes were less well-served, and
the scheduling of The South Bank Show, the Sunday arts programme, was edging
closer to 11pm than 10.30pm.
'It will not take much more slippage of this kind for the ITC to question
seriously whether the quality and diversity of the service required by the
1990 (Broadcasting) Act was in fact being met,' he told the annual
conference of the Viewers and Listeners Association in London.
Channel 4 - now winning 11.5 per cent of viewing - was right, he said, to
expand its audience share. He did not believe it had breached its remit to
appeal to tastes not catered for elsewhere.
'But there is a temptation for Channel 4 to go that extra inch for a little
more revenue, a little more audience and I believe at the margins of choice
the competitive instincts of the channel must yield to the sanctity of the
remit,' Mr Glencross warned.

FT  28 APR 93 / Inquiry attacks role of BBC governors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN UNOFFICIAL commission of inquiry into the future of the BBC yesterday
criticised the role of the BBC governors.
The commission, chaired by Mr Wilf Stevenson, director of the British Film
Institute, also expressed concern about the BBC's policy of producer choice,
which gives producers the right to buy in services from outside the
corporation.
The commission expressed 'serious worries' that the policy would favour
outsiders bidding at marginal cost over insiders shouldering BBC overheads,
leading to 'a running-down of the BBC'.
The inquiry said it had heard no adequate defence of the role of the BBC
governors, which caused confusion because they were in effect a second layer
of management.
It 'found little confidence in their representativeness, openness or
independence from government'.
The report is to be submitted to the Department of National Heritage in
response to the green paper on the future of the BBC.
The total number of BBC employees in the corporation's top two pay grades
has risen over the past three years while more than 3,000 staff jobs have
been lost, according to BBC figures. In 1990 there were 1,363 people in the
top two grades. By March that had risen to 1,424.

FT  28 APR 93 / Seconds out - Timex heads towards final countdown: Both
sides of the industrial dispute today put their case to the Commons
employment committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SACKING of the Timex workers has aroused anger in the ranks of organised
labour and raises a number of issues about British industrial relations of
interest far beyond the small circuit board production plant in Dundee.
Local union officials fear it could herald a new, more aggressive phase of
the rolling back of union power after 14 years of demoralising retreat.
To the strikers and many others in highly unionised Dundee the dispute is a
fight for justice. The strikers are mainly women, many with more than 30
years' service. Mr Jimmy Airlie, the AEEU union's executive officer for
Scotland, said: 'Nowhere else in Europe are decent women and men being
sacked for taking legitimate and legal industrial action.'
The company sees the dispute differently. Mr Peter Hall, Timex's chief
executive, said the decision was not taken lightly. The company feared the
union would take industrial tribunal action alleging unfair dismissal if the
company fired only strikers.
He said the loss-making Dundee plant faced the threat of closure because of
the commercial pressures of producing components under contract, and a more
assertive managerial style was required.
The US-registered multinational - now owned by the Norwegian entrepreneur Mr
Fred Olsen - was set up in Dundee in 1946 and for 37 years made components
for the watch industry before switching to circuit boards. One of the city's
biggest employers, it established good and close relations with the unions.
In 1990 Timex and the AEEU's forebear signed an innovatory agreement. In
return for profit sharing and share ownership, a generous savings plan, cash
lump sums and a worker seat on the board, the union agreed to radical
changes in working practices, with quality circles, teamwork and
flexibility.
Mr John Dryfe, US vice-president who worked at the plant for many years,
says the workers failed to deliver. They disagree. They claim Mr Hall's
arrival as chief executive in June 1991 led to a deterioration in relations.
Mr John Kydd, the former chief convener, said: 'I don't believe he has
worked in an industrial relations environment before.'
Mr Hall denies being anti-union. He said he worked well with the union
leadership until Mr Kydd was elected on December 7 last year.
Within days both sides were on a collision course. As a result of falling
demand, Mr Hall decided to lay off half the workers for the first half of
this year. The union suggested all workers be laid off in rotation. Mr Hall
thought this impractical. Early in January he laid off 120. On January 15
the union balloted workers on strike action. They backed the call by 92 per
cent to 8 per cent and walked out 14 days later.
Mr Hall warned the strikers they would be dismissed if they did not come
back. By this stage the company was looking at other ways to cut costs,
including a wage freeze and reductions in the value of pension and other
benefits. Mr Hall assured the strikers that was a 'separate' matter - a
return to work did not depend on the workers accepting new conditions.
The parent company, Timex Electronics, took a more direct role in the
dispute and Mr Dryfe flew in from the US. After 13 hours of talks on
February 10 and 11, he and Mr Hall believed they had a deal with local
negotiators. Mr Hall agrees the lay-off and cuts were linked by then.
Under the four-point peace plan Timex accepted rotation of lay-offs for half
the workforce subject to independent conciliation. The company also wanted a
wage freeze and a 10 per cent cut in benefits. In return, the workers were
promised half the profits made.
The union officials deny they accepted the peace plan. Mr Kydd's father, the
union's divisional organiser, said he was 'incensed' at the 'unprincipled'
decision to widen the bargaining agenda. After taking legal advice the union
recommended rejecting the plan, but that members return to work 'under
protest'.
Mr Hall insisted on acceptance of the plan and refused to let the workers
into the plant. On February 17 the workers again turned the plan down by a
show of hands. On the same day all the workers, including the 17 who worked
through the strike, received dismissal notices.
As far as Mr Hall is concerned that was the end of the strike and he started
to recruit the substitute labour force. Since then attitudes have hardened.
Timex has become a cause celebre in Scotland. Militants have flooded to the
factory gates in support of the pickets. The round-the-clock picket line,
complete with burning brazier, has none of the menace often associated with
picket lines. Sacked Timex women drink tea and puff cigarettes - many of the
workers who have replaced them are tough-looking men who wear balaclavas to
hide their identity.
The union has played the dispute cannily, using expert legal advice,
frustrating efforts by Timex to persuade local judges to prevent
demonstrations and marches outside the plant.
From May 17, 90 days after the dismissals, the company will have the right
to rehire ex-employees selectively without facing unfair dismissal charges
from the rest. 'We will consider the position then,' Mr Hall said. The
company will need a further 260 workers this summer to meet an upturn in
demand.
In the US, Mr Dryfe sounds more conciliatory, wanting a Japanese-style
agreement to boost productivity with an end to restrictive practices and
demarcation lines. Union officials said: 'We just want a negotiated
settlement.'

FT  28 APR 93 / Hoover faces surcharges row on 'free' flights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOOVER YESTERDAY faced fresh embarrassment over its troubled 'free flights'
promotion when it emerged that it had levied surcharges on people who had
qualified for free tickets to US and European destinations, and had later
suspended the surcharges after legal advice from the Association of British
Travel Agents.
Mr Richard Rankin, vice-president of European marketing services, said
yesterday that the surcharges - up to about Dollars 24 (Pounds 15) per
person - were to cover local airport taxes. Hoover had introduced them
recently to reduce the number of people who did not turn up for flights they
had booked.
Mr Rankin, joint chairman of a task force managing the promotion, said:
'Empty seats make it very inefficient for the sales promotion, and making
people pay a small amount in advance means that we reduce the number of
no-shows.'
Mr Rankin said surcharging had been in operation for about three weeks, and
was now suspended.
The original application forms for Hoover's 'free flights' - two free
tickets to the US or Europe conditional on spending a minimum of Pounds 100
on a Hoover product - made no mention of surcharges.
Mr Rankin said the levies were 'a legally identifiable charge' which
Hoover's lawyers said could be charged as they 'were not part of the flight
costs'. Hoover was talking to Abta and trading standards officers to see if
they could be re-imposed. He denied that they were an attempt to recoup some
of the promotional costs.
Maytag, Hoover's US parent, said last month that it would take a Dollars 30m
charge against first-quarter profits - the estimated cost of ensuring that
customers who qualify for 'free flights' actually get them. At the same time
three senior executives left Hoover and the company said the promotion had
caused 'tremendous difficulties'.
Hoover UK employees have since been warned by Mr Gerald Kamman, managing
director, of probable poor 1993 financial results.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour spokesman on consumer affairs, said disclosure of
the surcharges 'calls into question Hoover's good faith. It appears that
Hoover's rescue launch last month was more an exercise in public relations.'
Abta said yesterday it would like to see Hoover's 'free flights' offer
investigated. 'Offers like this can have a backlash on our industry and on
behalf of companies not causing consumers trouble.'
Hoover said yesterday it had 'conducted a full review of the promotion' and
a 'comprehensive' flight schedule had been developed 'to offer flights to
all customers entitled to travel'. It added that it had 'committed to
purchase' airline seats from 11 airlines on more than 11,000 flights.
Mr Rankin said that 10,000 people had flown on both promotions. Travel
industry estimates have been as high as 200,000.

FT  28 APR 93 / TUC region presses for wider balloting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NORTHERN region of TUC is to lobby for the next general secretary to be
elected by a vote of all members of TUC-affiliated unions.
Mr Bob Howard, regional secretary, said the TUC had for too long been seen
as a London-based office, selecting its general secretary and senior
officials on the basis of 'Buggins' turn'.
Stressing that he was not seeking the position, Mr Howard said he was not
against Mr John Monks, deputy general secretary who is expected to succeed
Mr Norman Willis when he takes early retirement.
The ethos of the union movement now, said Mr Howard, was to move towards
'universal democratic membership suffrage'.
Adoption of that in the selection of the general secretary by giving all
members of affiliated unions a personal vote could overcome the 'unfair
criticism' suffered by Mr Willis, he said. 'It would reinforce the authority
of whoever became general secretary.'
The TUC said that no union had asked to change the system. Nominations from
affiliated unions will be open until mid July. If more than one nomination
is made, delegates at the TUC's annual congress in September will vote on
the basis of one vote per 1,000 members they represent.

FT  28 APR 93 / Britain's car output up again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK is poised to become a substantial car production centre again with
output growing faster than in any other part of Europe, Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary (above), said yesterday. Mr
Heseltine was speaking at the opening of Honda's Pounds 300m car assembly
plant at Swindon, Wiltshire. The UK had attracted more than 40 per cent of
all Japanese inward investment into the European Community, and Japanese
investment in car manufacturing in Britain had 'had a major influence on the
revival' of that industry, he said. Honda, the only one of the three
Japanese carmakers in the UK not to recognise a trade union, defended its
policy, saying workers had a 37-hour week and retirement at 60.

<TEXT>
MR TONY COLE, the former chairman and chief executive of the Bestwood Group,
yesterday received a two-year suspended jail sentence after admitting
misappropriating more than Pounds 700,000 from the company to finance his
personal share dealing.
He was also disqualified from being a company director for 10 years.
Sentencing him, Judge Pownall QC said Mr Cole had always intended to repay
the money but must have known the misappropriation of the funds was wrong.
However, the losses he sustained after the October 1987 stock market crash
meant not all the funds could be repaid.

FT  28 APR 93 / Oxford St store sold for Pounds 34.5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LEGAL &amp; GENERAL, the insurance company, has sold the DH Evans department
store in Oxford Street for Pounds 34.5m to a private German investment
company.
The deal is the latest in a series of purchases by German investors of large
amounts of London property over the past six months. However, the deal bucks
this trend in that it concerns a retail property, rather than an office, and
it was struck at a relatively low yield (the ratio of income to capital
value) of 7.2 per cent.
The relatively high price paid reflects the possibility that the building
might be partially converted into offices or smaller shop units at a later
date.
The building of 335,000 sq ft is let to House of Fraser Stores on a lease
that has 90 years to run. The current rent, which was settled in 1991, is
Pounds 7.50 a sq ft.

FT  28 APR 93 / Insurance profits fear hits CU shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS ABOUT the impact of Saturday's City bomb damage on the profits of
Commercial Union, one of the UK's leading insurers, hit the company's share
price yesterday.
Initial indications are, however, that the rest of the UK insurance industry
will lose less from the attack than it did in the explosions of April 1992.
Commercial Union, which leads coverage on the NatWest Tower, said it was
'unlikely to lose less' than the Pounds 15m paid out last year. Its shares
fell 15p yesterday to close at 593p.
Other companies expect to be less badly hit. Sun Alliance said total net
losses were unlikely to exceed Pounds 15m, compared to Pounds 39m last year.
General Accident is forecasting a loss of less than Pounds 7m. Guardian
Royal Exchange and Royal Insurance are expecting to lose less than Pounds
5m.
Differences in reinsurance arrangements explain the contrasting outlook. The
main exposures of the companies stem from policies underwritten in 1992,
before terrorism was excluded from standard commercial policies.
Both Royal Insurance and Guardian Royal Exchange bought reinsurance policies
from Pool Re, the government-backed reinsurance company set up to handle
terrorism risk earlier this year.
Sun Alliance and General Accident bought extra reinsurance from alternative
sources in the commercial market. Commercial Union has less comprehensive
reinsurance arrangements.
The figures indicate that the government and reinsurance companies will bear
the brunt of the bill, estimated by the Association of British Insurers, the
industry trade association, between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m. The
companies are stressing, however, that their loss estimates are preliminary.

ZIMBABWE has brought in an incentive package aimed at boosting investment
and exports.
Yesterday Mr Bernard Chidzero, the finance minister, announced that any
foreign-owned company established after May 1, 1993 will have the right of
unrestricted remittance of dividends without requiring foreign currency
allocations from the central bank.
But these dividends will have to be purchased in the so-called export
retention market, where foreign currency is available at a premium of 28 per
cent above the official rate of ZDollars 6.4 to the US dollar.
Foreign-owned companies, allowed to remit dividends of 25 per cent of after
tax profits (for pre-1979 investors) or 50 per cent for post-1979 investors,
will be allowed to increase their dividend on new investments undertaken
after May 1.
The aim is to encourage existing foreign investors to reinvest in the
knowledge they will be able to remit 100 per cent from profits derived from
new investment.

COMPLAINTS to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade over allegedly
unfair use of anti-dumping actions to protect domestic industry are rising
rapidly, reflecting the growing use of anti-dumping rules to keep out
unwanted imports.
Dumping is normally defined as the sale of goods in foreign markets below
their domestic price or cost of production.
New Gatt figures show that anti-dumping investigations by the 25 members of
its Anti-dumping Code (the EC counting as one) rose to 237 in the year to
end-June 1992, up from 175 in the previous 12 months. Australia (76) led the
field, followed by the US (62), Mexico (25) and the EC (23). India (5) and
Japan (3) carried out their first anti-dumping investigations.
Developing countries are increasingly frequent users of anti-dumping rules,
though the main users (and offenders) are the leading industrialised
traders. In mid-1992 the US had 236 anti-dumping actions outstanding and the
EC 157.

IT'S a whale of a jumbo, as conceived by a 12-year-old Japanese schoolgirl.
She has won a competition sponsored by All Nippon Airways (ANA), the

financial year just ended for the first time since 1985. It has also just
cut its dividend. Two years ago, it asked its 14,000-strong workforce for
ideas on how to improve competitiveness and attract more passengers. One
favourite suggestion was to invite the public to draw a new colour design
for ANA's aircraft. So, the airline asked Japanese children up to the age of
15 to submit designs. The winner was chosen from more than 20,000 entries.
The repainted jumbo will enter service in September to coincide with the
opening of a new passenger terminal at Tokyo's Haneda airport.

<TEXT>
THE UK has authorised a scheduled air service between Belfast and New York,
the first for almost a decade.
London wants the granting of the licence to be seen by Mr Federico Pena, the
US transportation secretary, as a positive sign ahead of talks between the
two countries over replacing their bilateral aviation agreement.
Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport secretary, said: 'This is a special
exception given outside the terms of the UK/US aviation agreement.'
The new service - by American Trans Air, a US charter specialist based in
Indianapolis - starts in June with three flights a week.
The UK and the US have given themselves a year to negotiate a new agreement.

FT  28 APR 93 / World Trade News: Brittan urges US to avoid sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Leon Brittan, EC Commissioner for external economic relations, yesterday
urged the US to avoid imposing sanctions in the partially resolved dispute
over government procurement rules.
Sir Leon told the EC committee of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Brussels that sanctions would be 'unjustified', despite the failure of the
EC and US to resolve the Clinton administration's demands for access to the
Community's telecommunications market.
In his speech, Sir Leon also called on US local authorities to end 'Buy
American' discrimination. He said European companies offered first-rate
services, but they faced barriers in contracts ranging from bridge-building
across the Potomac, the planned extension of Dulles International Airport,
outside Washington DC, to the port of Los Angeles.
Recalling AT&amp;T's plans to challenge BT and Mercury by offering private
networks to international businesses in the UK, Sir Leon said: 'If AT&amp;T
wants to dig up Europe's sidewalks, good luck. But why should Europe not bid
to do the same in New York?'.
A US decision on sanctions is believed imminent. EC officials are nervous
about retaliation because Sir Leon has no 'ceasefire' understanding with Mr
Mickey Kantor, US trade representative. French-led pressure for a tough line
on trade remains strong.
After last week's partial deal, Mr Kantor said US sanctions, which would
have barred European companies from up to Dollars 50m in government
contracts, would be scaled down 'commensurate with the portion' that
telecoms represents in EC-US contracts. EC officials insist this means that
the US will avoid action in telecoms, the prize the US covets most.
Sir Leon praised the agreement, saying it showed both sides could do
business with each other, and that Washington was prepared at last to start
dismantling 60 years of steadily increasing 'Buy American' legislation.

FT  28 APR 93 / World Trade News: Russia signs satellite deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian space industry yesterday signed its first contract to launch a
western satellite in what it hopes will be the first step into a lucrative
western market.
The Dollars 36m (Pounds 23m) deal between Inmarsat, the international
telecommunications satellite operator, and Russia's Salyut design bureau, is
for the launch in 1995 of a mainly US-built satellite on a Russian Proton
rocket.
Mr Olof Lundberg, director-general of Inmarsat, said the launch would cost
'several million dollars' more than the Dollars 36m once his organisation
had paid extra costs including those of adapting its satellite to a Russian
launch. But it would still be cheaper than a western launch - according to
one Inmarsat official, up to Dollars 10m less.
Mr Lundberg also made a plea in favour of more generalised Russian access to
the western commercial satellite launch market. 'The Russian economy cannot
only be somewhere where westerners invest and sell goods.'
Fear of powerful Russian competition for western satellite launchers like
Arianespace, which charges Dollars 62m for a similar service, has meant that
the west has yet to remove obstacles to Russia competing in this market.
The Inmarsat deal was only made possible by a US promise to grant an export
licence so that the Inmarsat-3 satellite, whose main contractor is Martin
Marietta of the US but which also has some European components, can be
exported to the former Soviet Union for launch from the Baikonur cosmodrome
in Kazakhstan.
A draft agreement on the terms for this licence provides strict safeguards
to guard the technological secrets in the satellite from Russians who will
be working on the project.
The Russians have started parallel talks with the US and the European
Community on a possible tripartite deal allowing them a certain number of
launches a year and even setting price floors for their services.
Mr Dmitry Polukhin, Salyut's director general, said he expected agreement
soon on what share of the Russian side's profits would go to Kazakhstan,
which now owns the Soviet-built Baikonur.

FT  28 APR 93 / World Trade News: Mexico turns to import curbs as deficit
grows - The door is less open to free trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE proud of its free trade credentials, the Mexican government of
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has taken a series of measures in the
past few months to curb imports and to protect some of the country's most
inefficient industries.
The change in policy has created some resentment in those countries affected
and sits uneasily with the Mexican government's goal of joining a wider
North American free trade area.
However, after witnessing a 262 per cent increase in imports over the past
five years and seeing many of its largest industries hurt by foreign
competition, the government has evidently decided enough is enough.
Earlier this month it imposed duties of up to 1,105 per cent on about
Dollars 225m of imports from China, including clothes, shoes, textiles and
toys that it alleges were being dumped in Mexico below cost. These later
duties have been imposed before an investigation on the effects of Chinese
dumping on Mexican industries has been started. Were China a member of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, such duties would have been a breach
of the trade body's regulations.
Since September last year the government has introduced quality standards
and regulations for imports that make exporting to Mexico more difficult,
banned British beef for what it said was health reasons, then raised tariffs
on all beef to 15 per cent. It also reduced the duty-free allowance at the
border to just Dollars 50. This last measure provoked riots at several
border towns by Mexicans who regularly do their shopping in the US.
In February, the government imposed countervailing duties on Dollars 116m of
steel exports from six US companies, after alleging the steel products were
being dumped on the Mexican market. The duties range from 0.8 per cent to
39.3 per cent.
While the measures are consistent with Mexico's membership of Gatt, they
reflect a change in the government's objectives. In the past, the government
encouraged imports to put pressure on Mexican companies to lower margins and
increase productivity. But now officials seem more concerned about the
effect of imports on employment and the current account deficit.
Mr Jacobo Zaidenweber, a textile producer, and private sector adviser to the
trade ministry during the talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement,
says: 'The government used to be very rigorous in promoting free trade. But
now that there is a huge deficit and inflation is under control, there is a
little fine-tuning. We see a new willingness of the government to correct
the distortions of the market because of the changed priorities.'
A trade ministry official says: 'The perception I have is that industries
are worried about cheap imports and the government has responded, but only
when competition is unfair.'
He adds that the government remains committed to free trade. Anti-dumping
duties were only necessary, he says, because the economy was open, and had
never been needed in Mexico's protectionist past.
The government's decision to help selected industries reflects an increased
political sensitivity to the private sector at a time when the economy is
slowing (growth was just an annualised 1.9 per cent in the fourth quarter
last year) and because elections are due next year.
The new barriers will protect those industries that have been worst affected
by Mexico's trade liberalisation. The toy industry, now protected by a 351
per cent tariff against Chinese imports, was seriously affected. According
to Canacintra, a business chamber, sales of Mexican toys fell by 24.5 per
cent last year.
The textile sector, now protected from Chinese imports by tariffs ranging
from 54 to more than 500 per cent, has also suffered. In the past seven
years the Mexican government had cut import tariffs from 50 per cent to 20
per cent, and eliminated import licences that were often never available.
But the result has been a flood of cheap, mainly Asian imports. The domestic
textile and clothing sector shrank by 5 per cent last year alone. Hundreds
of textile companies have closed, with thousands of jobs lost.
A government official admitted last year that there was some connection
between the new regulations on imports and a desire to improve the trade
balance, but he thought the effect would be temporary as importers became
accustomed to the new procedures.
Mexico's current account deficit last year was Dollars 22.8bn, with monthly
imports about Dollars 4bn in the last nine months of the year. However, in
January and February the growth in the deficit slowed markedly, with
February's shortfall at Dollars 1.24bn.
While part of this reduction may be explained by the new measures, the
reduction in economic growth also should have curbed the appetite for
foreign goods.

FT  28 APR 93 / Fed backs dollar against rising yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Federal Reserve intervened on the foreign exchange markets yesterday,
buying dollars for yen, in a clear indication that the Clinton
administration is concerned about the recent appreciation of the Japanese
currency. The first such Fed intervention this year came after the US
currency hit another all-time low of Y109.15 in New York.
Dealers said there were four rounds of dollar-buying by the Federal Reserve
in New York at levels between Y109.50 and Y110.50. The intervention pushed
the dollar up to a New York close of Y111.7.
There was no detailed explanation for the intervention from US officials.
However, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury Secretary, told a senate subcommittee
hearing that excessive volatility in exchange rates could be
counter-productive.
The US intervention also followed Japanese accusations that Washington had
been trying to talk up the yen in an effort to reduce Japan's trade surplus
with the US.
Mr Bentsen said: 'I think there have been some misconceptions about US
exchange rate policy. I want to underscore the administration's belief that
exchange rates should reflect fundamentals. We are monitoring developments
closely.'
Mr Bentsen was quoted as saying there would be a communique on exchange
rates after a Group of Seven finance ministers' meeting tomorrow.
Mr Mark Brett, an economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London, said that
the Clinton administration might now think that the continuing depreciation
of the dollar would have only a limited impact on the trade surplus.

FT  28 APR 93 / Canadian Dollars falls after meek budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Canadian dollar and bond prices tumbled yesterday as financial markets
signalled their disappointment at the federal government's unexpectedly meek
assault on the deficit in its latest budget.
Business leaders were virtually unanimous in criticising Mr Donald
Mazankowski, finance minister, for failing to take a bigger slice out of
government spending at a time when public opinion is solidly behind greater
fiscal discipline.
The budget, which left the deficit for the year to March 31, 1994, unchanged
from last December's forecast of CDollars 32.6bn (Pounds 16.3bn), is widely
seen as an effort to avoid tough decisions before a change at the top of the
ruling Progressive Conservative party in June, and the election expected
between August and October.
The Canadian dollar lost about a cent yesterday, closing at 78.35 US cents.
The Bank of Canada also pushed up its trend-setting bank rate yesterday for
only the second time in the past 12 weeks.
Mr Mazankowski estimated the budget deficit for the year to March 31, 1993,
at CDollars 35.5bn, about CDollars 8bn higher than his projection a year
ago, and the second highest shortfall on record. He forecast that the
deficit would drop to CDollars 8bn in 1997-98, eliminating the need for new
borrowings.
Economists queried his assumption that gross domestic product will grow by
an average of more than 4 per cent a year from 1994 to 1998.
Mr Lloyd Atkinson, chief economist at Bank of Montreal, warned that 'when
combined with the sharp deterioration at the provincial level, Canada now
faces a fiscal crisis that, if not dealt with effectively - and soon - could
precipitate a national economic crisis, characterised by a much weaker
Canadian dollar, sharply higher interest rates and significantly weaker
growth.'

FT  28 APR 93 / Clinton brings spring to Bob Dole's career: The fixer and
blocker who has been energised by the Republican party's straitened times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is not the only one in Washington commemorating a
first 100 days this week. Senator Robert Dole of Kansas may have been the
Republican leader in the Senate since 1984, but never before was he obliged
to operate with a Democrat in the White House and with his own party in such
apparent disarray after a sharp electoral repudiation.
If the president is getting predictably mixed reviews, Mr Dole is receiving
surprisingly good ones. The big notch on his belt is defeat of Mr Clinton's
economic stimulus package, achieved by holding together in a filibuster the
43 Republicans in the Senate.
This alone made Mr Dole, who will be 70 in July, a man to be reckoned with
again, and his party's most effective national voice on everything from
Bosnia to the budget. Some polls even make him the new favourite for the
Republican nomination in 1996, remarkable since that would be 20 years after
he came off so badly as a mean-spirited partisan vice-presidential
candidate, when matched against Mr Walter Mondale, and after two poor runs
at his party banner in 1980 and 1988.
Even his former enemies are impressed. Congressman Newt Gingrich, the
conservative ideologue and Republican House Whip from Georgia, who once
derided him as 'the tax collector for the welfare state', now says 'this is
the best spring of Bob Dole's political career'.
Senator George Mitchell, Democratic leader and personal friend, concurs,
suggesting Mr Dole 'clearly has been energised by no longer having to carry
water for the (Bush) administration.' There is more than a little truth in
this, for the caustic street fighter from Russell, Kansas, never had much
personal truck with the patrician former president.
In defeat and victory, Bob Dole has been a conspicuous figure in Washington,
where he is one of its funniest, sometimes most vicious and always quoteable
politicians. Yet it did seem with the advent of the Clinton administration
that at best he was holding the Republican fort while it sorted out its
succession among the younger likes of former vice-president Dan Quayle, Mr
Jack Kemp and Mr Dick Cheney from the Bush administration, Senator Phil
Gramm from Texas, Governor Carroll Campbell of South Carolina and Governor
Bill Weld of Massachussetts, and a few talk show hosts.
Even now, a good first 100 days in opposition is no guarantee of longer term
success, and Mr Dole knows he is walking a very fine line. Frustrating Mr
Clinton over the stimulus package, mismanaged as it was by the
administration, may earn him Washington credits but not necessarily national
approbation.
For example, a recent NBC-Wall Street Journal survey found 60 per cent
believing that the Republicans were just 'playing politics' in resisting the
president's economic proposals: by a 52-29 per cent margin, those polled
thought Mr Clinton was more serious about reducing the budget deficit than
the Republicans were: and last year's independent presidential candidate Mr
Ross Perot is back on television again, all the time muttering about
'gridlock'.
Logically, having drawn the president's blood, Mr Dole should be
contemplating offering positive alternative policies, rather than recycling
complaints about 'tax and spend' Democrats.
His problem here is twofold: first, he is an expert legislative 'fixer' and
blocker but not a man with big ideas: second he is contemptuous of those in
his party with big ideas (like Mr Kemp and Mr Weld) and the sharpness of his
tongue often makes these feelings mutual.
He could also let the Democrats in Congress unravel the Clinton agenda, as
they are perfectly capable of doing. There has been much talk in Washington
since the defeat of the stimulus package about the balance of power on
domestic issues shifting back from the administration to Congress, which is
where it mostly resided from 1986-1992.
But if Mr Mitchell and Mr Tom Foley, speaker of the House, get their troops
back in line, as they did over the first budget bill, and if the president
learns from his initial political mistakes, then pure Republican
obstructionism may not be enough.
There is a theory in the capital that the Republican leader's ulterior
motive is to be invited to a seat at the Democratic administration's
policy-making table.
Partisan he may be, but in the Reagan and Bush years he was also very much
the arbitrator between the White House and both parties in Congress, a role
which, as a proud man and as an insider, he found congenial and flattering.
This worries some keepers of the conservative flame, long suspicious of Mr
Dole. A recent Wall Street Journal editorial, for example, concluded: 'asked
what price he wants for peace with Mr Clinton, Bob Dole said 'big'. We hope
he means something bigger than merely being a 'player' with President
Clinton.'
On the other hand, 'playing' with Mr Perot and his populist army is the sort
of venture that might appeal to him, and many Republicans, even more. At
least they talk the same plain language and Mr Perot is not a Democrat.

FT  28 APR 93 / IMF chief urges Bundesbank cut: Camdessus says way is clear
for actions over interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL pressure on Germany to take further action to speed up
European growth intensified yesterday when Mr Michel Camdessus,
International Monetary Fund managing director, said a 'substantial decrease'
in German interest rates was appropriate.
Mr Camdessus did not specify when the Bundesbank should take necessary
action but said because of the substantial slowdown in German economic
activity 'a rapid decline in inflation' was likely in Germany, leaving the
way clear for further monetary easing.
Even though he acknowledged growth prospects for the industrial world had
deteriorated in recent months, Mr Camdessus was generally upbeat about the
possibility of a broadly based world recovery. This was on the grounds that
several leading nations had already taken steps to stimulate economic
activity and cut budget deficits.
'Among the industrial countries there is a sense of action,' Mr Camdessus
said. At meetings in Washington this week leading nations would send a
'message of confidence' that the outlook was improving.
An important stimulus to world growth was that many developing nations had
performed 'brilliantly' in recording substantial economic growth and
avoiding the slowdown in the industrial world. He singled out India for its
'admirable' recent actions in economic reform.
Mr Camdessus was speaking before tomorrow's meeting in Washington of finance
ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven leading
industrial nations - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and
Canada.  The IMF's policy-setting interim committee, representing 24
countries, is meeting on Friday.
Mr Camdessus's comments appeared substantially more optimistic than the tone
of the IMF's twice-yearly report on the world economy which earlier this
week painted a bleak picture of the immediate outlook. It was particularly
gloomy about Europe and said prospects for a substantial increase in
international growth were 'hesitant and uneven'.
Although the US government should take extra steps to bring down its fiscal
deficit in the longer term, Mr Camdessus welcomed the 'bold' action by the
Clinton administration in announcing its budget consolidation plan.
He was encouraged also by programmes in the UK and France to reduce
government borrowing and by the Japanese package to speed growth. He
welcomed clear signs in the UK that its recession was over, and while
stressing that more action was needed had been pleased to see recent cuts in
the Bundesbank's leading interest rates. The US hopes tomorrow's G7 meeting
will 'lay the groundwork' for world recovery, Mr Larry Summers, US Treasury
under-secretary for international affairs, said.
He said an important part of a world recovery programme would be further
cuts in European interest rates.
Mr Summers said inflation in almost all G7 countries was 'under control'.
There was a less pressing need to take joint action to bear down on rising
prices, leaving more leeway for steps to improve growth.

THE White House yesterday tried to minimise the impact of published remarks
by Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, to the effect that its economic
programme was in trouble in Congress and that the North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta) currently was politically 'dead'.
President Bill Clinton said he had no reason to be angry with Mr Panetta. Ms
Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, insisted the legislative
programme was 'on track', that Nafta was 'alive and well', and that Mr
Panetta was only speculating on its prospects 'if it went up to the Hill
this week'.
She said that whatever the current opposition the Nafta treaty would be seen
in a different light when it was eventually presented for ratification with
supplemental agreements now being negotiated with Canada and Mexico. Mr
Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, also told Congress yesterday that the
treaty remained an administration priority.
Mr Panetta was particularly concerned at the anti-Nafta campaign being waged
by Mr Ross Perot, last year's independent presidential candidate. This, he
said, 'makes it even more difficult' to get the treaty through Congress when
it already had many enemies.
The general thrust of his comments, in an interview with US reporters, did
not appear to help the administration, recently defeated over the Dollars
16bn (Pounds 10bn) stimulus package and increasingly subject to criticism
from Congress over various aspects of its extensive domestic agenda.
The budget director, a former congressman from California, specifically said
he was advising Mr Clinton to delay releasing his plan for healthcare
reform, probably due out next month, until after the budget reconciliation
bill has been voted in June.
He predicted stiff congressional resistance to published proposals to trim
the costs of Medicaid and Medicare, the federally funded health care
programmes, to the energy tax in its present form, to the investment tax
credit, already under fire from Democrats, and to the new student loan
programme.
He thought there was no chance of passage of a value added tax unless it
were a 'revenue neutral' substitute for payroll and income taxes.
The president ran the risk of seeing his programmes torn apart by a
combination of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans. He urged Mr
Clinton 'to define his priorities more clearly,' and to be willing to carry
the fight for his proposals to the public.

MEXICO's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has provoked a
national storm by postponing elections for governor in the state of Yucatan
from November this year to May 1995.
The local Yucatan Congress, which is controlled by the PRI and satellite
parties, changed the state constitution on Friday, enabling the vote to be
postponed.
The Congress will now select an interim governor to rule from February 1994
to July 1995.
Mexico's centre-right National Action Party (PAN) was seen as having a good
chance of winning November's election. The state is one of the PAN's
strongholds, and the mayor of Merida, the state capital, is from the party.
The new election will be held after the September 1994 presidential
election, thus forestalling a potentially embarrassing loss for the PRI, or
opposition protests, at a sensitive time.
On Sunday the PAN organised a referendum and protest march in Merida against
the change, with an estimated 40,000 supporters. The PAN is also seeking
legal action against deputies who approved what it considers an illegal
modification to the constitution. It may walk out of negotiations over party
financing reform in protest.
The local PRI has defended the move, arguing that it was not in Yucatan's
interests to hold its gubernatorial election so soon before the presidential
election.

FT  28 APR 93 / G7 focuses more on medium term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMORROW'S meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the
Group of Seven leading industrial countries should be able to focus on
medium term problems facing the world economy as well as the short term
outlook.
For although the International Monetary Fund this week scaled down its
expectations of global economic growth this year, developments over the past
three months in the US, Japan and Europe have brought policies in the main
industrial countries into better balance.
However, US moves to cut its budget deficit, the Japanese growth package and
the slow decline in German interest rates may not be beyond criticism.
In discussions ahead of this week's meetings of the G7 and IMF in
Washington, some of America's partners have warned that the US deficit
reductions are no more than a useful beginning.
Japan's partners find it difficult to estimate how far the Japanese package
will boost the economy, while the US this week said it would like further
cuts in German rates.
The moves represent a willingness on the part of the main industrial
countries to share responsibilities for strengthening the world economy.
Policymakers believe they should contain downside risks to the global
economy and ensure that tomorrow's G7 meeting in Washington is harmonious -
in contrast to some in past years.
If harmony does prevail, much of the credit will go to Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the
US Treasury secretary, who has pursued a policy of avoiding international
economic confrontation. 'It is excellent working with Bentsen,' a German
official enthused yesterday. European officials report that the US now takes
the views of its G7 partners seriously.
This month's agreement on measures to help Russia has also boosted
confidence in the G7 as a forum for co-operation.
British officials expect Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to underline the
importance of pushing ahead with structural reform, including the need to
remove rigidities in continental Europe's labour markets. He will also
stress the importance of a liberal world trading system and the need for
western industrial countries to open their markets to goods from eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union.

FT  28 APR 93 / Fed backs dollar against rising yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Federal Reserve intervened on the foreign exchange markets yesterday,
buying dollars for yen, in the clearest indication yet that the Clinton
administration is concerned about the recent appreciation of the Japanese
currency. The Fed intervened in support of the dollar against the yen for
the first time this year after the US currency hit another all-time low of
Y109.15 in New York.
Dealers said there were four rounds of dollar-buying by the Federal Reserve
in New York at levels between Y109.50 and Y110.50. The intervention took
currency dealers by surprise, pushing the dollar up to a London close of
Y111.2.
There was no detailed explanation for the intervention from US officials.
However, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury Secretary, told a senate subcommittee
hearing that excessive volatility in exchange rates could be
counter-productive.
The US intervention also followed accusations by Japanese officials that the
Clinton administration had been attempting to talk up the Yen in an effort
to reduce Japan's trade surplus with the US.
Mr Bentsen said: 'I think there have been some misconceptions about US
exchange rate policy. I want to underscore the administration's belief that
exchange rates should reflect fundamentals. We are monitoring developments
closely.'
Mr Bentsen was quoted as saying there would be a communique on exchange
rates after a Group of Seven finance ministers meeting tomorrow.
Mr Mark Brett, an economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London, said that
the Clinton administration might now think that the continuing depreciation
of the dollar would have only a limited impact on the trade surplus.
Mr Jim O'Neill of Swiss Banking Corporation, said that the US administration
might have been moved to act by the weakness in both US bond and equity
markets in recent days and by a gold price surge. Currencies, Page 35

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NINTH round of Middle East peace talks opened in Washington yesterday
with the Clinton administration showing immediately its commitment to become
directly involved in the negotiations.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, called the heads of the five
delegations, representing Syria, Israel, Lebanon, Jordan and the
Palestinians, to a meeting last night, the first such gathering since the
process was launched in Madrid in October 1991. 'A new sense of urgency and
intensity in the talks must be evident,' he told a US Senate sub-committee
yesterday.
Mr Christopher's initiative was recognition of the frailty of the peace
process, suspended for over four months because of the deportation of 400
Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza. The Palestinian delegation
returned to Washington only after bitter debate, and will be under intense
pressure to withdraw if progress is not made quickly.
Much of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip was paralysed by a strike
yesterday called by Hamas and other radical groups to protest at the
resumption of talks. Anger in the occupied territories has been heightened
by Israel's decision nearly a month ago to seal off the areas, barring
nearly 120,000 Palestinian workers from their jobs. The government yesterday
eased the ban, allowing back 20,000 employed mainly in construction and
agriculture.
Israel is also expected to announce shortly the names of more than 30
Palestinians, deported some years ago, who will now be allowed home.
While these gestures may ease tension in the territories, the Palestinian
delegation will need to show substantial progress towards self-rule if it is
to check increasing radicalisation of the West Bank and Gaza.

ERITREANS celebrated in the streets of Asmara last night after provisional

support for independence from Ethiopia.
International recognition is now a formality. In a 98 per cent turnout of
registered voters, 1.1m voted Yes and only 1,822 voted No, writes Julie
Wheelwright in Asmara.
'Eritrea is a sovereign country as of today, April 27, 1993,' former
Eritrean guerrilla leader Isayas Afewerki and secretary general of the
provisional government told a news conference in the capital.
A formal declaration of independence, achieved after a 30-year war which
cost over 100,000 lives, will be made on May 24 - the second anniversary of
the defeat by Eritrean guerrillas of the army of President Mengistu Haile
Mariam, the former Ethiopian dictator who fled into exile.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA and Taiwan exchanged handshakes, pleasantries and a few barbed
criticisms of each other as they met in Singapore for the highest-level
contact between the two in more than 40 years of enmity.
'We have made good progress and look for better things to come,' said Mr
Wang Daohan, leader of the Beijing delegation. The talks, which conclude
today, are described as unofficial, but it is clear both Beijing and Taipei
see this meeting as an important step towards improving relations across the
Taiwan straits.
The two sides have apparently agreed to open a formal channel of
communication - the first such move since the foundation of the People's
Republic of China in 1949 and the removal of the Kuomintang forces of
Generalissimo Chiang Kai Chek to Taiwan. Mr Wang said discussions on
economic issues would be held soon.
There was also agreement on fishing disputes and on fighting piracy in the
region. But suspicion and mutual distrust was evident. Mr Koo Chen Fu,
leader of Taiwan's delegation, said the Beijing side had tried to raise the
question of opening direct trade, shipping and air links with Taiwan. Taiwan
is against any such direct links until China recognises Taiwan. Taiwan is
also frustrated by China's refusal to offer any legal framework for
protection of large-scale Taiwanese investments.

FT  28 APR 93 / Afrikaners bury standard-bearer of apartheid: Old
certainties are gone, with no new certainties emerging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY in Pretoria, the Afrikaner capital, the white tribe gathered to
bury one of the last standard-bearers of apartheid, Mr Andries Treurnicht,
academic and theologian, right-wing politician and champion of Afrikanerdom.
It was a subdued gathering, a manifestation of the confused and depressed
state of Afrikaners, many of whom still cling to the teachings of the
generation of Afrikaner churchmen epitomised by Mr Treurnicht, who died of
heart failure last Thursday aged 72: that the Bible ordains apartheid, and
that to violate it is to go against the will of God.
In the Dutch Reformed Church and in nearby Church square, perched on folding
chairs around the statue of Afrikanerdom's greatest hero, Paul Kruger,
president of the 19th century Boer republic of the Transvaal, some 3,000
prayed for their departed leader. But their bowed heads seemed to symbolise
more than religious devotion: old certainties were being buried, while no
new certainties had emerged to take their place.
'He was the one that could save the Afrikaner,' said a bearded man ruefully,
as he walked in sombre procession to the grave, in a cemetery where Mr
Treurnicht's mentor, Hendrik Verwoerd, architect of apartheid, is also
buried.
'We have got the muscles, we have got the belief, and we have got the Bible
 -that's the most important thing,' said another mourner, carrying the
four-colour flag of the oldTransvaal republic. For him, the God of Abraham
had decreed racial mixing a sin, whatever has been done by the 'new'
Afrikaners of Mr F W de Klerk's government to cleanse the statute book of
racial discrimination. For these mourners were honouring a man whose
ideology was intellectually powerful, although hideously flawed: last of a
generation of conservatives who saw apartheid as a religion.
They are left with leaders of a wholly different type: fanatics like Mr
Clive Derby-Lewis, senior official of Mr Treurnicht's Conservative Party,
who is expected soon to be charged in connection with the murder of black
activist Mr Chris Hani; and Mr Eugene Terre'blanche, leader of the
paramilitary Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement).
Dressed in the 1960s fashions which still predominate in Pretoria, the
matrons of Afrikanerdom standing beside husbands sang the anthem of the
white tribe of Africa: Die Stem (the call). But it was a flat performance,
with nothing like the passion and anger which suffused the anthem sung at
the graveside of Mr Hani: Go Well, Umkhonto, militant hymn to a fallen
warrior.
Next to 100,000 black mourners filled with righteous fury, the scant 3,000
baffled souls who mourned Mr Treurnicht yesterday seemed only pitiful: they
know they have lost the battle, but have yet to come to terms with the
peace.

Armed troops were abundant at most polling stations, part of a deployment of

disturbances or irregularities were reported in at least six other
constituencies.
But in general, orderly lines of men - and, for the first time in any
Arabian Peninsula election, women - voted calmly.
International observers said they had noted some irregularities. The
Financial Times saw two occasions on which individuals managed to vote
twice. The international observers are due to report their findings

FT  28 APR 93 / Israel announces plan to reorganise bank system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ISRAELI finance ministry and central bank yesterday unveiled a
comprehensive reorganisation of the country's banking system. The reforms
are designed to increase competition among banks, decrease their holdings in
non-financial companies and reduce their role in the capital markets.
Under the programme, to be presented to the cabinet for approval on
Sunday,the banks will not be allowed to hold more than 25 per cent of the
shares in non-financial companies, and their total investment in non-banking
assets will be limited to 25 per cent of their capital.
This proposal will force Israel's two largest banks - Hapoalim and Leumi -
to sell off a significant share of their non-banking holdings, mainly in
industry, real estate and energy.
Hapoalim holds 40 per cent of Clal, one of Israel's largest holding
companies, which has
interests in electronics, textiles, trade and property.
Mr Amiram Sivan, managing director of Hapoalim, said the reorganisation plan
would severely damage the international standing of Israel's banking system.
To increase competition among the banks, the three largest banking groups
will also be forced to sell off some of their smaller banks. Under this
proposal, Leumi will have to sell Bank Igud, Hapoalim will be forced to sell
Bank Otsar Hahayal, and Israel Discount Bank will have to sell Barclays.
The three largest banks control more than 80 per cent of the banking
activity in Israel.
'In my view, these decisions are right and necessary for the good of the
economy,' said Mr Avraham Shohat, finance minister. 'On the one hand, they
do not undermine the stability of the banking system, and on the other hand,
they will lead to more competition and prevent conflicts of interest
within the system.'
The government in effect became the owner of the banks in 1983 when it
bailed out the four largest banks, to the tune of Dollars 7bn (Pounds
4.4bn), following a share manipulation scandal. Under an agreement, due to
expire this October, the banks continued to be run by their original owners
and were never formally nationalised.
As part of the reorganisation programme, an accord will be put into effect
in October under which shares in the banks will be transferred to public
trusts which will elect directors in each bank and control policy until the
banks are sold in the next three years.
The reorganisation is meant to pave the way for a public offering of 20 per
cent of the shares in Hapoalim at the end of May. An earlier plan to sell
the shares was torpedoed three months ago by parliament, which demanded the
government present it first with a concrete plan for structural changes in
the banks.

   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREAN President Kim Young-sam has declared war on military corruption
in the boldest move yet of his political reform programme.
The investigation of the military establishment represents a direct
challenge to the men who ruled South Korea for 32 years until Mr Kim became
president in February.
The government is investigating allegations that military promotions and
weapons procurement were heavily influenced by bribery during the
administration of President Roh Tae-woo, Mr Kim's predecessor.
A former chief of naval operations and a former marine corps commandant were
charged yesterday with taking kickbacks on promotions between 1989 and 1991,
while a former air force chief of staff, General Chung Yong-hoo, is under
investigation for similiar charges.
Meanwhile, General Chung has alleged that corruption was involved in the
government's sudden decision in 1991 to switch the selection of the
country's next-generation fighter aircraft from the McDonnell Douglas F-18
to the F-16 of General Dynamics.
McDonnell Douglas was initally awarded the contract in 1989 for the Dollars
5bn (Pounds 3.14bn) Korean Fighter Programme, but the government later cited
budget problems in reversing the decision, explaining the F-16 was cheaper.
The government audit agency yesterday began probing procurement in the past
decade, including purchase of the F-16 and submarines, tanks and other
equipment.
The probes into the military, however, are fraught with peril. They threaten
to weaken further the already sensitive relationship between Mr Kim and the
military when security tensions are rising due to North Korea's suspected
development of a nuclear weapon.
The new president last month replaced the top military echelon, including
the army chief of staff, in a bid to strengthen civilian control over the
armed forces.
The government has also cracked down on secret organisations among the
officer corps that once wielded considerable political power, most prominent
of which was the Hanahoe (One Mind) society, whose members included the two
previous presidents.
Mr Kim's actions threaten to demoralise the armed forces and raises the
possibility that they may oppose him.
'Military opposition to President Kim could occur if it thinks its vital
interests are threatened, such as a major reduction in defence spending, or
if relations between North and South Korea deteriorate dramatically,' said
Mr Ahn Chung-si, political science professor at Seoul National University.
Officers could join 'old guard' politicians and bureaucrats also threatened
by the anti-corruption campaign, to try to stop the reform process, said Mr
Ahn.

THE TWO-YEAR decline in the Japanese economy may be bottoming out, according
to the official index which predicts economic activity six months ahead.
The official index of leading economic indicators, published yesterday, rose
to 80 per cent in February. It was the second month in a row in which the
index was above the 50 per cent level which marks the line between continued
decline and renewed growth.
However, a clutch of other statistics, including a survey revealing sharp
falls in consumer confidence in the first three months of the year, suggest
the economy remains in a fragile state without strong signs of recovery.
The surge in the index of leading indicators was mainly due to low commodity
prices, modest increases in the money supply, higher machinery orders, a
sustained rise in housing starts and an improved outlooked for manufacturing
industry's profits.
The leading index is a gauge of economic conditions six months ahead. The
coincident index which measures current economic conditions rose to 66.7 per
cent in February, the first time it has stood above 50 per cent for two
years.
The Economic Planning Agency, which published the indices, warned it was too
early to say the economy was about to recover. The surge in February came
before the recent sharp appreciation of the yen, which may have damaged
business confidence. It may also reflect only a temporary pick-up in
business activity before the end of the last financial year on March 31.
Other figures published by the EPA suggest there is little prospect the
economy will recover strongly or quickly.
Consumer confidence fell again in the first three months, by 1.3 per cent to
38.3 per cent. The fall was mainly due to a sharp deterioration in the
employment outlook as companies cut staff. The employment outlook index fell
by 14.4 per cent to 23.7 per cent.
A Ministry of International Trade and Industry survey of large retailers
found that retail sales last month were 7.5 per cent down in the year
before, the 10th consecutive monthly decline and the largest fall since the
ministry began the survey in 1971.
Hotel occupancy rates in Tokyo were down 7 per cent last month on a year
ago, while a survey of 100 top restaurants reported the lowest increase in
sales, 2.8 per cent, since 1975.
The Ministry of Labour designated a further 19 industries as eligible for
labour subsidies to help them through restructuring, while they reduce
workforces. About 138 industries, with about 3.67m workers, are now eligible
for the subsidies, which help to cover wages while workers are laid off or
undergoing retraining.
Among the 19 sectors newly designated are the car and computer industries.
The seriousness of the downturn was underlined by the first-ever subsidies
given to the motor and computer industries to cover restructuring.

A FORMER Philippine cabinet minister facing corruption charges alleged
yesterday that President Fidel Ramos was linked to the purchase of 65
Japanese fire engines at inflated prices, Reuter reports from Manila.
Mr Luis Santos, the local government secretary of former President Corazon
Aquino, was charged last Thursday along with six others with buying
overpriced firefighting vehicles from a Japanese company.
Mr Santos said in a radio interview that Mr Ramos, then defence chief, was
responsible for the decision to buy the trucks.
'The one involved was the former defence sec-retary. I was not involved in
that. I even tried to block payment for that transaction but I resigned
before I could do so,' Mr Santos said.
Prosecutors said the fire engines were bought in 1991 from Japan's Taihei
after the Korean company Ssangyong was originally awarded the contract by
the bidding committee because of its lower bid.
Mr Santos, who was in charge of the police force, approved the purchase
order, they added.
The overpayment amounted to 41.7m pesos (Pounds 1m).

FT  28 APR 93 / Sharif emboldened by street support: Dismissed Pakistani PM
is in uncharacteristic fighting mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NAWAZ Sharif is in fighting mood. For Pakistan's former prime minister,
widely regarded as something of a reticent man with an awkward manner, that
is a change.
What helps is that Mr Sharif is convinced that a growing number of people,
especially businessmen, oppose the dismissal of his government by President
Ghulam Ishaq Khan on charges of corruption ten days ago.
Mr Sharif's drive to regain power comes as Pakistan's week-old interim
administration, which has promised to hold national elections on July 14, is
showing signs of rifts between its key members.
Public support for Mr Sharif first became evident during his train journey
from Islamabad to his home city of Lahore last week. Showered with rose
petals during stopovers, he promised to fight back.
'Only one man (the president) is playing with the destiny of this nation,'
said Mr Sharif. 'My jihad (holy campaign) is for the future of Pakistan. I
am certain that the decision on July 14 will be in my favour.'
He later visited Karachi, Pakistan's business city and capital of Sindh
province, home to his political foe, Pakistan People's Party leader Ms
Benazir Bhutto. Police used batons to fight back a crowd which swelled to
thousands.
Now Mr Sharif is expected to travel to the North Western Frontier and
Baluchistan provinces to try to establish himself as a national leader.
The business community is seen as vital to Mr Sharif's campaign. During his
29 months in office, Mr Sharif's government initiated wide ranging economic
reforms aimed at unshackling the economy from the hold of the bureaucracy.
Although the interim government has insisted it will not reverse any of
those measures and promised that Pakistan will honour all its domestic and
international contracts, nervousness continues.
Pakistan's leading stock market, the Karachi Stock Exchange, lost 37 points,
or roughly 3 per cent of its value the day after Mr Sharif's fall, the
steepest drop on a single day this year. Since then, two government
supported financial institutions have bought shares to prevent further
falls. The index has recovered about 1 per cent since then.
Mr Naeem-ul-haq, a director at the Karachi-based Schon group which bought 3
of the 56 public sector companies sold by Mr Sharif's government, says:
'Nawaz Sharif's downfall has shattered business confidence. I have yet to
meet one businessman who feels positive about this change.'
Another leading businessman says planned new investments have been put on
hold 'until it becomes clear that signs of uncertainty have ended'.
'Mere statements of reassurances from the new government will not do the
job,' he says.
The uncertainty has been further intensified by differences within the new
government. Ms Bhutto wants the dissolution of the four provincial
assemblies so that national and provincial elections are held
simultaneously.
But her call is being resisted by the president and the interim prime
minister, Mr Balakh Sher Mazari. One of Ms Bhutto's aides says: 'The option
of (Bhutto supporters) leaving the new government is very much alive if
(our)demands are not met'.
The president's resistance to dissolving the provincial assemblies appears
to be because he is due for re-election this November. According to senior
officials, Mr Khan could rely for support in the presidential election on
three of the four existing provincial governments.
It is difficult to assess the likely outcome of the emerging rivalries
between the different factions. What is clear is that Mr Sharif is taking
his campaign to the streets with uncharacteristic boldness.

FT  28 APR 93 / Clinton keeps the Balkans guessing: The debate in Washington
on what a 'stronger' Balkans policy should mean
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton can choose his words with great care. One adjective
he has used more than once when publicly discussing his options in Bosnia is
'humble', both in contemplating the enormity of any form of US intervention
and the intractability of the Balkan problem.
This sense of humility extends beyond the Oval Office to many of those
contributing to the public debate on Bosnia. For though there is a vocal US
lobby for a maximalist US role, there are also plenty of voices advising
caution. Both camps accept that there are no easy options.
Caught squarely in the confused middle is the American public,
intermittently bombarded with graphic media coverage but not consistently
so. Last week, for example, the bloody end of the siege in Waco pushed
Bosnia down the newslists.
The latest Newsweek poll split evenly - 47 per cent to 47 per cent - in
response to the question of whether Bosnia was America's problem. A
CNN/Gallup survey found a 62-30 per cent opposition to air strikes. It is
worth noting that Mr Clinton pays very careful attention to public opinion.
Divisions on the Bosnian options apply to Capitol Hill, where two Democrats
influential in foreign affairs take diametrically opposed views. Congressman
Lee Hamilton of Indiana, chairman of the House foreign affairs committee,
argues that Bosnia is not a vital US interest, believes in continuing with
sanctions and diplomatic pressure.
But Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware, chairman of the European sub-committee
of the foreign relations committee and just back from Bosnia, has put out an
eight-point plan including immediate western air strikes and the lifting of
the UN arms embargo against Bosnia itself.
Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, has also come out guardedly in
favour of air strikes.
Inside the administration, similar divisions apply. Mrs Madeleine Albright,
the UN ambassador, has advocated air strikes, allowable, she says, without
further UN approval. The 12 regional desk officers at the State Department
endorse this approach. Mr Les Aspin, the secretary of defence, and Mr
Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, are thought to favour limited
offensive action. But Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, is
thought to favour caution, as does General Colin Powell, chairman of the
joint chiefs of staff.
Mr Clinton, who has problems with his own military on several fronts,
acknowledged at his press conference last week the legitimacy of Gen
Powell's view that 'we must have a clearly defined objective that must be
met'.
In the media, the heavyweight pundits of the New York Times - Les Gelb,
Anthony Lewis and A M Rosenthal - have thundered behind the cause of US
action.
But the Boston Globe at the weekend advised against unilateral bombing.
Richard Cohen, the Washington Post columnist, wrote yesterday that the
public debate was still mostly among 'engaged Op Ed writers' and that no
popular mandate existed behind intervention.
Also weighing in behind intervention have been Mr Elie Wiesel, addressing Mr
Clinton directly at last week's opening in Washington of the Holocaust
museum, and, yesterday, Mr George Shultz, secretary of state in the Reagan
administration, who called for 'very large, sustained air and sea based
attack' on positions inside Serbia itself.
Amid this confusing welter of external and internal advice, with western
Europe, after its latest foreign ministerial meeting, incapable of doing
other than wait on the US initiative, and with still some uncertainty about
the Russian reaction even after Sunday's referendum victory for President
Boris Yeltsin, Mr Clinton has promised 'a stronger policy' by the US and its
allies 'within a few days'.
The New York Times, quoting an unidentified senior official, reported
yesterday that the most likely US action would involve a programme of
limited bombing of Bosnian Serb installations, designed to produce a
ceasefire and a new round of negotiations. But it said that lifting the arms
embargo was still under active consideration as an alternative to air
strikes.
This would be preceded by further consultation with US allies and at the UN,
perhaps including a European trip by Mr Christopher or another senior
official, more White House meetings, and extensive consultation with
Congress. The task of preparing America for what comes next has barely
begun.

<TEXT>
CONTROVERSIAL plans to pump more than DM1bn (Pounds 400m) of state subsidies
into the Ekostahl steel plant in eastern Germany are likely to be turned
down by the European Commission today.
The decision will take the form of a proposal to member states rather than a
binding ruling, and will be subject to ministers' unanimous app-roval, but
is still likely to cause a storm in Germany.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, yesterday defended the
Ekostahl plans in a last-minute attempt to influence the decision.
Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, is recommending that the
Eko-stahl plan should not be exempt from strict rules on state aid for steel
producers. The Commission is under pressure from Germany, Spain and Italy to
approve steel aid, but Mr Van Miert has repeatedly stressed the Commission
will adopt a tough attitude, to avoid a damaging 'subsidy race' among
European governments.
An ambitious plan worked out by the Treuhand - the state agency responsible
for privatisation -would modernise Ekostahl's cold steel works for DM310m.
In a second phase, Ekostahl would be turned into a mini-mill for DM750m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SERB forces yesterday defied the international community by launching an
attack in Moslem-held north-western Bosnia just as tough new United Nations
sanctions went into force against Belgrade.
Fighting also erupted in other parts of former Yugoslavia, one day after
Bosnian Serbs refused to accept an international peace plan signed by rival
Moslems and Croats.
Serb forces attacked a Moslem enclave around the town of Bihac and captured
three villages, UN officials said. Serb infantry supported by tanks and
artillery crossed into the north of the so-called 'Bihac pocket' in the
early hours of yesterday.
The Bosnian Serb army dissociated itself from the assault, saying it was the
work of paramilitary vigilantes and that it was powerless to stop them.
General Lars-Eric Wahlgren, the UN protection force commander in former
Yugoslavia, said in Belgrade that he had ordered some 1,900 French UN troops
stationed in the Bihac area to use force to protect civilians.
'I have ordered my men to use force if necessary to prevent human rights
violations, abusing civilians or taking them hostage, torching or blowing up
homes,' he said.
A UN spokesman said in Zagreb the Serbs had taken the villages of Bursaci,
Gradina and Radici, located 45 km north of Bihac, near Bosnia's border with
the Serb-held Krajina region of Croatia.
The spokesman said UN military observers around Bihac had noted a build-up
of about 1,000 Serb soldiers, but the attack had been carried out by a force
of only 150 men and 10 tanks.
The attack raised immediate concerns for the humanitarian needs of the
300,000 civilians trapped in the Bihac region who depend heavily on UN aid
convoys.
Meanwhile, a UN aid convoy was shelled in central Bosnia yesterday and two
relief workers, including a Briton, were seriously injured. UN officials
said the a 16-truck convoy was returning to the Moslem town of Zenica to
collect food for another run to the town of Tuzla, in the north-east, when
it came under mortar fire.
The new fighting was sure to anger the international community, which
started applying sanctions against the Serbian-led rump Yugoslavia yesterday
and is considering limited military intervention to halt the year-old civil
war.
Nato chiefs, meeting in Brussels yesterday, focused on a narrowing set of
options ranging from air strikes to the setting up of heavily defended safe
havens modelled on the precedent of northern Iraq.
The top-level committee meeting was attended by General Colin Powell,
chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff.
There was a consensus in Brussels that any bombing of military positions or
supply lines would involve some degree of alliance involvement, and it was
made clear that Washington would not obtain backing from allies without
specific authority from the UN.
After the meeting Field Marshal Sir Richard Vincent, the chairman of Nato's
military committee, a top Nato general fiercely criticised the West for
failing to lay out what it wanted to achieve in Bosnia and said he opposed
military intervention until the wider goals were better defined.
'I'm healthily sceptical ..I'm determined that we will not (take action)
without somebody saying at the outset what it is they require us to do,' Mr
Vincent said.
Nato contingency planning has so far concentrated on formation of a
peacekeeping force which would back up the Vance-Owen peace plan if a
ceasefire were established. But officials said these plans - calling mainly
on US, British, French and Russian troops - had now been 'put on ice'.
Mr Vincent's concerns were partially reflected in testimony by Mr Warren
Christopher, the US secretary of state, to a senate panel in Washington
yesterday, when he set rigorous criteria for the use of force by the US.
He said the use of force had to meet four tests: the goal would have to be
stated clearly to the American people; there must be a strong likelihood
that use of force could be successful; there must be an exit strategy; and a
programme that could sustain the support of the American people.

Fighting also erupted in other parts of former Yugoslavia, one day after
Bosnian Serbs refused to accept an international peace plan signed by rival
Moslems and Croats.
About 100 Serb troops backed by 10 tanks and artillery advanced several
miles into the area around the north-western town of Bihac early yesterday,
a spokesman for the UN forces said.
UN military observers stationed in the Bihac region reported fighting in
four locations in the area, where 300,000 people are being supplied with aid
by the UN.
The new fighting was sure to anger the international community, which
started applying sanctions against the Serbian-led rump Yugoslavia yesterday
and is considering limited military intervention to halt the year-old civil
war.
In Belgrade, a map showing the locations of bomb shelters in the city was
published by 'popular demand' in Vecernje Novosti, the mass circulation
daily.
Nato chiefs, meeting in Brussels yesterday, focused on a narrowing set of
options ranging from air strikes to the setting up of protected zones.
The top-level committee meeting was attended by General Colin Powell,
chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff.
The allies were awaiting an announcement on a possible visit this week by Mr
Warren Christopher, the US secretary of State, to European capitals. These
were expected to include London, Paris, Bonn, Rome and Moscow.
Mr Christopher, testifying to a senate panel in Washington yesterday, set
rigorous criteria for the use of force by the US.
He said the use of force had to meet four tests: the goal would have to be
stated clearly to the American people; there must be a strong likelihood the
use of force could be successful; there must be an exit strategy; and a
programme that could sustain the support of the American people.
There was a consensus in Brussels that any bombing of military positions or
supply lines would involve some degree of alliance involvement, and it was
made clear that Washington would not obtain backing from allies without
specific authority from the UN.
Nato contingency planning has so far concentrated on formation of a
peacekeeping force which would back up the Vance-Owen peace plan if a
ceasefire were established. But officials said these plans - calling mainly
on US, British, French and Russian troops - had now been 'put on ice'.
Officials said there had been 'reasonably detailed' consideration of
different kinds of safe areas for Bosnian Moslems. The lowest level would
just involve 'relief zones'.
Alternatively safe areas might be set up inside perimeters controlled by UN
troops, but without the forces necessary to withstand heavy attacks.
Another option would be more heavily defended safe havens modelled on the
precedent of northern Iraq.
In Stockholm, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said the
options did not exclude lifting the UN embargo on arms shipments to Bosnian
Moslem forces.
However, he said that such a move would require careful consideration before
it could be accepted as 'a wise decision'.
Speaking at a press conference after a two-day visit to Sweden, Mr Hurd said
he did not believe it was possible in practice to lift the arms embargo for
one party only.
A decision to end the embargo, which would require a UN Security Council
resolution, would therefore involve a shift in policy from one of trying to
stop the fighting in Bosnia to allowing the combatants to fight it out to
the finish.

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin warned Bosnian Serbs yesterday they could
expect no protection from Russia if they continued to defy an international
peace plan for the fragmented former Yugoslav republic, Reuter reports from
Moscow.
But a Russian foreign ministry spokesman said the use of force by an
international military contingent could deepen the conflict and spread it
beyond former Yugoslavia's boundaries.
Mr Yeltsin described a plan drafted by mediators Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus
Vance and rejected on Monday by the Bosnian Serbs as the only prospect for
peace in the region.
'The time has come for decisive measures to quell the conflict,' he said. Mr
Yeltsin's statement suggested a more confident Kremlin approach to the
former Yugoslavia following the president's victory over hardliners in
Sunday's Russian referendum.
He won 58 per cent support in the plebiscite, which the president hopes will
allow him to break the power of a parliament heavily coloured by nationalist
thinking.
Nationalist opponents of the president regard his support of international
sanctions against Serbia, including the despatch of troops under the United
Nations flag, as a betrayal of cultural and ethnic links with Slav Serbs.
Mr Yeltsin dispelled any possibility of Moscow breaking ranks with the west
on former Yugoslavia as long as he was president. The west had long feared
the Kremlin could back down on a joint front that had been a litmus test of
the post-cold war order.
'The Russian Federation will not protect those who resist the will of the
world community,' Mr Yeltsin said, dashing any remaining Serb hopes of help
from Moscow.
The Russian president, despite his reference to 'decisive measures', did not
make it clear whether Russia would back the use of force against the Bosnian
Serbs if economic sanctions failed to make them pull back.

FT  28 APR 93 / Private sector investment pledge
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EBRD will take steps to increase private sector investment, Mr Jacques
Attali, the bank's president, promised yesterday, write Anthony Robinson and
Robert Peston. He promised also to reinforce budgetary controls and
introduce greater transparency.
He was warned by Ms Anne Wibble, Swedish finance minister, new chairman of
the board, that 'the time for grand designs' was over. 'I would like the
bank to focus on the operational aspects of its activity,' she stressed.
Mr Attali said he had considered resigning eight months ago because the
pressures of building the institution were too great. However, he had been
dissuaded by friends. He said that after criticism of the bank, there was
now no question of his quitting until his 'baby' could 'go it alone'.
Mrs Wibble said the performance of the bank, set up to help the
transformation of former communist states into market economies, would be
judged on how it helped develop 'new enterprises, more jobs and less poverty
for the ordinary citizen'.
She welcomed the bank's commitment to prepare an 'action plan' to ensure
that 60 per cent of its portfolio should be in the private sector. At
present only 50 per cent of signed projects are in the private sector,
reflecting in particular the slow pace of privatisation in many countries
and the recent addition of many new members.
Mr Attali said he was under pressure from shareholders to increase the
amount of equity finance provided by the bank. However, he said he was
concerned at the additional risks the bank would take on and the likely
delay in its move into profitability.
Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the exchequer, had earlier called on the
bank to become more involved in equity financing of private sector projects
and welcomed the recent board decision to 'interpret more flexibly' the 35
per cent limit on the bank's participation in individual projects.

FT  28 APR 93 / Russians cool to new bank proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S deputy prime minister, Mr Alexander Shokhin, yesterday dismissed
the need for a new bank, modelled on the German Kredit-anstalt fur
Wiederaufbau, to foster the financing and development of small and medium
companies in Russia.
'It is one of the main functions of the EBRD (European Bank for
Reconstruction and Devlopment), we must build on this,' he said in an
interview. 'We should certainly use the German experience, but if we create
yet another bank we will waste more time and money.'
Creation of a new bank was proposed by Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance
minister at the opening of the EBRD annual meeting on Monday.
Mr Shokhin also toned down criticism of slow disbursement by the EBRD
expressed by Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of the Russian central bank,
in his official statement as Russia's representative on the EBRD board of
governors. 'It is true that disbursement is slow,' said Mr Shokhin, 'but
that is more because of legal problems over the negative pledge clause
demanded by the World Bank, than problems with the EBRD itself which
operates on a more commercial basis.'
When the EBRD sought to accelerate disbursements through the use of escrow
accounts, it encountered problems with legal experts at Russia's own finance
ministry, he said. 'Our experts feared that opening such accounts would
facilitate the illegal flow of capital out of Russia. But after losing a
year sorting out problems like these, we finally agreed on a formula using
escrow accounts in a narrow range of approved banks.'
Russia wants the EBRD to extend the range of projects it is prepared to
finance away from the current emphasis on oil and other energy projects.

FT  28 APR 93 / Andreotti loses immunity, attacks Mafia probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ROME, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN Italian Senate commission yesterday agreed to waive the parliamentary
immunity of Mr Giulio Andreotti, seven times Christian Democrat prime
minister, bringing him one step closer to being investigated by Palermo
magistrates for alleged collusion with the Sicilian mafia.
It is the first time the commission has agreed to waive the immunity of such
a prominent politician in a case of alleged links between the world of
politics and organised crime.
Mr Andreotti, aged 74, has been in public office since the founding of the
republic and is seen in Italy as the symbol of the political establishment
long controlled by the Christian Democrats.
Yesterday he issued an angry statement repeating his view that the
investigation by Palermo magistrates was a conspiracy to denigrate him. He
added: 'I have absolutely no fear of the truth and will vigorously use every
means to unmask these incredible machinations.'
The 215 strong Senate, of which Mr Andreotti is a life member, must conduct
a secret ballot to validate the decision.
Yesterday,the voting of the 23 person commission was split according to
political loyalty. The eight Christian Democrat members abstained, backed by
two Socialists and the president of the commission, while one Liberal voted
against him losing his immunity.
Mr Andreotti revealed on March 27 that he had been notified by Palermo
magistrates they wished to investigate him for alleged links with the mafia.
The Senate commission has been hearing the case since April 14, and has four
times been sent extra documentation from Palermo.
The thrust of the Palermo magistrates' case is that Mr Andreotti has acted
as the point of reference for the Sicilian mafia, Cosa Nostra, in Rome
especially to influence the course of court cases against senior mafia
members. The evidence is based extensively on testimony of former mafia
members co-operating with the authorities. Mr Gabriele Cagliari, the former
chairman of Italy's publicly-owned Eni energy and chemicals group, yesterday
admitted to having paid L26bn (Pounds 11.05m) in illegal contributions to
the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties, Haig Simonian writes from
Milan.
Mr Cagliari said the system of illegal funding preceded his tenure as
chairman, which began in 1989, but admitted he had not sought to stop the
payments.
Earlier this month, Mr Franco Reviglio, his predecessor as chairman between
1983-89, was notified by magistrates that he was under investigation for
allegedly receiving illicit funds. The news triggered Mr Reviglio's
resignation as finance minister in the former Amato government.
Mr Cagliari has been detained in Milan's San Vittore prison since March 9 on
allegations of corruption and illegally funding political parties. At the
weekend, magistrates investigating political corruption added new charges of
falsifying company accounts.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WILDLY varying referendum results from the Russian Federation show a
nation divided by money, power and sentiment.
The sentiment was clearly demonstrated in the region around President Boris
Yeltsin's home town of Yekaterinburg, where he won his best result - 84.4
per cent support for the question: 'Do you trust the president?'.
The angriest response came from Ingushetia, a southern region where he has
imposed emergency rule to suppress ethnic strife. Only 2.3 per cent of
voters there said they supported him. The other party in that conflict,
North Ossetia, which has enjoyed Kremlin support in repelling land claims by
the Ingush, produced a healthy 63 per cent 'yes' vote.
Elsewhere, the results were determined by whether Mr Yeltsin provided the
best deal in terms of local prosperity and power. Nowhere was this clearer
than among the Russian Federation's constituent republics, to whom Mr
Yeltsin has promised varying degrees of economic and political
self-sufficiency.
Yakutia-Sakha, which accounts for one sixth of Russia's land mass but less
than 1 per cent of the population, produced 67.8 per cent in support. Its
conservative but flexible leadership has negotiated substantial rights to
local diamond and gold wealth.
Mr Yeltsin's support was also high in potentially rich regions like the
Tyumen oil-producing area, which produced 58.3 per cent of 'yes' votes and
sees its future in continuing reforms and more independence from Moscow.
The president can also point to support from industrial regions, where
workers have been receiving unlimited wage rises despite many state-owned
plants' financial difficulties and falling production.
However, the dictum that he has less support in the countryside seems to
have been only true in the poorer agricultural regions, where the collective
farm boss is still firmly in charge of the minds and hearts of peasants.
Mr Yeltsin failed to obtain a majority in regions of the latter category,
such as Kursk (42.2 per cent in favour) but he scraped through in richer
southern agricultural lands like Rostov province (a 55 per cent majority),
where people have been promised precious extra land.

FT  28 APR 93 / Attali pressed to get on with main task: The EBRD board
wants focus fixed on helping ex-communist states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACQUES ATTALI, the flamboyant and controversial president of the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, remains at the head of the
institution he helped create. But after this week's very public expressions
of concern by bank governors over reports of the EBRD's high spending on its
new building, he cannot yet be sure that he has the unreserved support of
his main shareholders.
That will hang on the outcome, probably in a few weeks' time, of the
investigation by the bank's audit committee into the allegations of
extravagance in fitting out its London headquarters. In the meantime, the
countries that set up the bank will be pressing Mr Attali not to delay the
organisational changes he has promised including the appointment of a strong
budget director.
The ministers from the industrialised and former Communist countries that
make up the bank's board of governors signalled they want it to press ahead
with its task of helping eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union develop
market-based economies by steering clear of EBRD management issues in the
closed session of the bank's annual meeting on Monday afternoon.
Indeed, the session, which was devoted to the fostering of small and
medium-sized enterprises in former Communist countries, could mark a new
chapter in the bank's activities, if, as Mr Attali believes, it results in a
more decentralised and responsive mode of operations.
But Mr Attali is not completely out of the woods. Although Mr Theo Waigel,
German finance minister and this year's chairman of the EBRD board, said
governors had not discussed this week appointment of a chief executive to
strengthen management of the bank, officials said Bonn was prepared to
revive the idea if necessary.
Under the Clinton administration, the US, which holds 10 per cent of the
EBRD's capital and is its largest shareholder, has been far more supportive
of the bank's aims than previously. But Washington is keeping its options
open at least until the audit committee reports.
Mr Roger Altman, US deputy treasury secretary, praised the bank for
providing financial support to the private sector in the new market
economies. But he was careful not to endorse Mr Attali personally.
On the other hand, officials from the bank's member countries acknowledge
that Mr Attali has achieved a great deal in the two years since the EBRD was
inaugurated. He has kept the problems of the former Communist countries in
the public eye and has been prominent in support of more open markets in the
west for the products of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. He is
recognised as a source of dynamism and ideas from which the bank has
profited.
There is also a realisation among many shareholders that the EBRD has a
difficult task to perform that is not made easier by the statutes agreed by
member governments at the time of its foundation.
It was at the insistence of those founding members that the bank was saddled
with an unwieldy 23-person board of directors, each with an alternate and
office. The bank must lend on good bankable deals but also must not be doing
things that a normal commercial bank must do. As one official observed, such
a condition, if taken to a logical conclusion, is a formula for inaction.
Economic and administrative problems in the former Communist countries have
been another factor behind the much criticised slow disbursement of funds.
This was acknowledged on Monday by Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the Russian
governor, in an otherwise critical speech.
Member governments have sought this week to lend support to the bank's
efforts and to prevent a decline of morale among its staff.
The EBRD can take heart from the fact that its biggest shareholders, the
Group of Seven leading industrial countries, keep finding new tasks for it
to perform. The multilateral nuclear safety fund, which the bank will help
administer, will be operational this week.
Another sign of confidence in the bank is the proposed Dollars 300m fund to
foster small and medium-sized businesses in Russia. The bank has been asked
to create and manage the fund.

FT  28 APR 93 / E German steel aid faces EC barrier
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROVERSIAL plans to pump more than DM1bn (Pounds 400m) of state subsidies
into the Ekostahl steel plant in eastern Germany are likely to be turned
down by the European Commission today.
The decision will take the form of a proposal to member states rather than a
binding ruling, and will be subject to ministers' unanimous app-roval, but
is still likely to cause a storm in Germany.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, yesterday defended the
Ekostahl plans in a last-minute attempt to influence the decision.
Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, is recommending that the
Eko-stahl plan should not be exempt from strict rules on state aid for steel
producers. The Commission is under pressure from Germany, Spain and Italy to
approve steel aid, but Mr Van Miert has repeatedly stressed that the
Commission will adopt a tough attitude, to avoid a damaging 'subsidy race'
among European governments when the whole industry is under pressure.
An ambitious plan worked out by the Treuhand - the state agency responsible
for privatising the east German economy - would involve modernisation of
Ekostahl's cold steel works for DM310m. In a second phase, Ekostahl would be
turned into a mini-mill at a cost of DM750m.
The Commission, which has already expressed doubts about Spanish plans to
subsidise its steel industry, is gradually piecing together an overall
rescue plan for the sector.
Last week it approved measures to protect the EC industry from unfairly
cheap imports of Czech and Slovak steel. The Commission today will also
discuss a package of social measures, including funding of at least Ecu240m
(Pounds 187.5m), to help cover redundancy and closure costs in the industry.

FT  28 APR 93 / VW tries to calm worried suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE top management of Volkswagen yesterday attempted to calm the nerves of
key component-makers rattled by the company's dramatic plans to slash costs
and reduce outside suppliers.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, head of VW since January, told representatives of 29
companies from the group's home state of Lower Saxony that Volkswagen was
ready to help them meet new conditions.
The meeting was called by VW and Mr Gerhard Schroder, the regional prime
minister, who is also a senior member of VW's supervisory board. It was
intended to counter ill-feeling and fears stirred by the arrival at Europe's
largest car maker of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez, recently recruited from General
Motors in Detroit, and installed as production and procurement director.
It is also a response to private complaints from other German car
manufacturers that VW's over-aggressive and highly-publicised approach to
cost-cutting was terrorising the components industry and damaging confidence
when the whole motor industry was struggling to restructure.
Mr Lopez was dubbed 'the Russelsheim strangler' in recognition of the
cost-cutting expertise he demonstrated while head of buying at Adam Opel,
GM's German subsidiary.
He told the meeting that processing from raw materials to the end product
had to be optimised in order to give the customer increased value in terms
of quality, service and price. 'We can only win together,' he added.
VW, which dived DM1.25bn (Pounds 500m) into the red in the first quarter of
this year, following an 87 per cent profits plunge to DM147m in 1992, is
planning to reduce suppliers on its books from around 1,500 to 200.
At the same time, according to Mr Piech, parts prices are to be driven as
low as possible without pushing suppliers out of business.
The tone at yesterday's meeting was milder than that at earlier
'consultations' at which Mr Lopez reportedly told his audience that he
required 'the highest quality, the best service, the lowest prices. . . .
and soon'.
According to analysts, at least 30 per cent of Germany's 3,000 automotive
parts suppliers is threatened by the motor industry's restructuring plans.
Most at risk are the 2,900 small and medium-sized companies, which,
according to Price Waterhouse, account for only DM21bn of the components
industry's total annual sales of DM130bn.

FT  28 APR 93 / Yeltsin heads for showdown with congress

THE first shots in the post-referendum confrontation between the president
and parliament in Russia were fired yesterday as President Boris Yeltsin's
closest aides and ministers demanded immediate action on a new constitution
and economic reforms.
At the same time parliament cancelled a presidential decree keeping in
office a pro-Yeltsin republican leader who had been fired by his
conservative parliament.
The parliament voted to annul the decree signed this month by Mr Yeltsin
which restored in office Mr Vasily Guslyannikov, the president of the small
autonomous republic of Mordovia who had been removed by an order of his
Supreme Soviet. The deputies voted under article 109 of the constitution,
recently introduced by them, which enable them to abolish all presidential
decrees pending an appeal to the Constitutional Court.
Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the deputy prime minister and a key aide to Mr Yeltsin
during his referendum campaign,
said that Mr Boris Yeltsin should take the following steps in the days and
weeks ahead:
Consult with leaders of the regions and the republics on a draft
constitution and a law on elections: on agreement, he would present them to
the parliament and invite approval.
Following a likely refusal, decree a new constitution which would replace
the current Supreme Soviet and Congress of People's Deputies with a
bicameral parliament, and further decree elections to these in the autumn.
Mr Shakhrai said Mr Yeltsin would meet regional and republican leaders
tomorrow.
Mr Yeltsin's tactic, according to Mr Shakhrai, would be to proceed swiftly
but without 'major blunders' to fulfil the mandate given by the voters in
bringing in constitutional and economic reform.
Mr Shakhrai, introducing the draft constitution, said that it laid the basis
for a 'presidential republic ..with some of the values of a parliamentary
system.'
Mr Sergei Alexeyev, an expert on constitutional law who has helped prepare
the constitution, said it was the blueprint for a truly federal state which
would forestall the tendencies towards disintegration.
One such tendency showed itself yesterday with the announcement that
citizens of St Petersburg, Russia's second city, had voted to turn their
city into an autonomous republic.

FT  28 APR 93 / Congress threatens end to EBRD funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Congress is likely to refuse further money for the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development as a result of the outcry over excessive
spending on salaries, private aircraft and office fittings.
The Clinton administration has requested Dollars 70m (Pounds 45.1m) in its
1994 budget for the US's share of the EBRD's paid-up capital, but senior
members of Congress warned yesterday that they would almost certainly refuse
the request.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, said he shared Congress's concerns
about the EBRD, calling its spending 'absolutely unacceptable'. He defended
the capital subscription, however, and said the US was insisting on
restructuring of the EBRD's budget process, much tighter oversight and
outside auditing.
As the US issued its warning, Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's chairman,
promised in London to reinforce budgetary controls and introduce greater
transparency. Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Democratic chairman of
the Senate committee that controls foreign aid spending, said he planned to
reduce the EBRD budget allocation to zero unless very substantial changes in
the bank's management were made.
He said: 'I will not vote for one cent of money from the US for the EBRD
unless I see very, very substantial movements towards reform - not promises
of reform. There will not be one cent in my proposal unless I see that, and
frankly I don't think I am going to.'
Mr Leahy delivered a scathing indictment of the EBRD's spending and of Mr
Attali. 'I want to know why we should entrust another dime of the public's
money to Mr Attali,' he said. 'It's almost like this money that has gone in
there is a slush fund for personal use.'
The US is the largest of the 56 shareholders in the EBRD. It accounts for 10
per cent of the bank's capital.
Republican members are likely to follow the Democrats on the EBRD.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Mr Leahy's Republican counterpart on
the foreign operations spending committee, said: 'Short of immediate changes
in the policies and practices of the EBRD, I - like the chairman - cannot
support the administration's request for Dollars 70m.' Foreign aid remains
one of the least popular areas of the budget in the US Congress. Members
warn that it remains politically impossible to reduce aid to Israel and
Egypt, which receive the lion's share of the US aid budget, but Congress is
warning that Dollars 1.8bn needs to be found to fund the US's recent promise
of new bilateral aid at the Tokyo G7 meeting. The administration has not yet
specified where it wants the money to come from. Mr Leahy said he might not
support the administration's request for Dollars 1.25bn this year for the
International Development Association, a third of the US's contribution to
the tenth replenishment of this concessional loan arm of the World Bank.
Mr Bentsen argued, however, that the money was essentially the same in real
terms as the last contribution, negotiated in 1986.
He added that the US's ability to influence the multilateral development
banks was impaired by its position as the only leading industrialised
country in arrears in its payments to those institutions, to the tune of
Dollars 374m. 'These arrears damage the standing of the US in the
international community,' he said.
Mr Attali, speaking after the bank's annual meeting, said that the bank
would increase its private-sector investment.
He was warned by Ms Anne Wibble, the Swedish finance minister who has taken
over from Mr Theo Waigel of Germany as chairman of the bank's board of
governors, that 'the time for grand designs' was over. 'I would like the
bank to focus on the operational aspects of its activity,' she stressed.
Mr Attali said that after the criticism of the bank, there was now no
question of his quitting until his 'baby' can 'go it alone'.
Attali pressed to get on with main task, Page 2

FT  28 APR 93 / Halifax seeks freedom to widen range of products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALIFAX, Britain's largest building society, says it wants to join the
Personal Investment Authority, the proposed new self-regulatory body for
retail financial services, and to distribute a wider variety of financial
products.
Mr Jim Birrell, Halifax's chief executive, told the Financial Times that he
would like to see a relaxation of the polarisation rules that require
financial services outlets either to sell one supplier's products
exclusively or to offer the best product of each supplier.
Polarisation was introduced under the Financial Services Act to limit some
of the most abused sales practices. However, critics of the measure have
argued that what is needed is not polarisation but better regulation.
Mr Birrell said the PIA was showing signs of becoming an effective
regulator. 'We feel encouraged with the way the PIA is shaping up and we
thought we should say so,' he said.
The future of the PIA has been cloudy because life insurance companies have
said they will not join unless leading banks and building societies do,
while banks and building societies are insisting that tough rules should be
set for independent sales agents. Mr Birrell's remarks thus make the PIA's
success more likely.
Tied agents such as Halifax do not need to belong to any self-regulatory
body. Instead they are regulated indirectly by Lautro, the self-regulatory
body for life insurers, which oversees their insurance-company supplier.
Participation in self-regulatory bodies should give banks and building
societies the influence they deserve to help change the regulatory
structure, Mr Birrell said. 'We would like a seat at the table and the
ability to influence the discussion,' he added.
He made clear that Halifax, which is 'tied' to the life insurer Standard
Life, is hoping for regulatory changes that will allow it to offer a far
wider range of products. 'If you take the Marks and Spencer analogy, you
would deal with a limited number of suppliers for mainline products, but
surely they deal with more than one.'
Mr Birrell said Halifax had no plans to end its tied relationship with
Standard Life. 'But we want to look at our long-term strategy in retail
financial services.'
Among other things, Halifax would like to see the de-polarisation of certain
products, unit trusts in particular, whose pricing structure is more readily
apparent to potential customers.

FT  28 APR 93 / BT challenged by AT&amp;T on price of transatlantic calls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph, the largest US telecommunications
operator, is challenging British Telecom to agree cuts of more than half in
the 'wholesale' price of transatlantic phone calls.
The result could be significant tariff reductions for customers.
AT&amp;T's proposal, for a reduction of about 60 per cent in the accounting
rates for telecom traffic between the US and the UK, has become a weapon in
the battle between the two telecommunications companies over their pending
applications to gain direct access to the public network in each other's
countries.
Accounting rates are, in effect, the price which BT and Mercury pay AT&amp;T for
delivering international calls to their final destination in the US, and
vice versa. Rates are set and revised periodically by the operators under an
international agreement.
AT&amp;T has told the Federal Communications Commission, the US telecoms
regulator, that BT has already refused its request for an accounting rate
cut. BT yesterday insisted it was still under consideration, and would
respond next month.
Under strong pressure from the commission, transatlantic accounting rates
have been reduced by nearly half over the past two years.
AT&amp;T has told the commission that accounting rates could be cut by up to
another 60 per cent 'as a first step', with further reductions in line with
'the continuing pace of technology'.
Analysts believe AT&amp;T's proposed rates may be close to the actual cost of
delivering a transatlantic call. Mr Greg Staples, a Washington consultant,
said: 'If AT&amp;T thinks it can connect transatlantic calls from Florida to
Montana for half the current charge, it's up to BT to show why it cannot
reach London and Manchester for the same fee.'
So far operators have had a mutual interest in keeping accounting rates
high. But in the current battle over access to each other's markets, both
companies are portraying themselves to the regulatory authorities as firm
friends of open competition and lower prices.
AT&amp;T's argument for lower accounting rates is made in a petition to the FCC
opposing BT's application for access to the US's public network.

FT  28 APR 93 / IoD attacks handling of economy: Confidence rises sharply
but business leaders demand government rethinks strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH business leaders yesterday warned that long-term recovery would be
threatened without fundamental changes in government policy.
The gloomy prophecy came as the Confederation of British Industry announced
the sharpest rise in business optimism since 1983 in the first four months
of this year, with exports driving a significant improvement in
manufacturing output and order books.
The generally upbeat survey follows the release of other encouraging
economic indicators this week.
But delegates to the Institute of Directors' annual convention in London
heard business leaders warn that Britain could slip back into a boom-bust
cycle without a fundamental rethink of economic strategy.
Mr Peter Morgan, the IoD's director general, said the business climate was
improving but Britain risked re-entering the 'dreary pattern of post-war
economic decline' unless business and government worked together to build
lasting prosperity.
Accusing government of being 'in the hands of economists', Mr Morgan said
any recovery on the way was 'more or less over the dead bodies of Bank of
England and Treasury officials'. He called for an independent central bank
to oversee a policy of 'sound money' and the right financial framework for
stable economic growth.
Sir Alistair Grant, chairman of Argyll Group, the food retailer which owns
Safeway, Presto and Lo-Cost, attacked the government for being 'in the grip
of events' and for lack of vision. The state of the economy today was 'very
largely the consequence of Tory government policy'.
He added: 'Surely we are asking for no more than the appropriate level of
competence in government when we require from John Major that he should
create a vision of 21st century Britain, that he should assemble and
organise a government team that is competent to do its job.'
The CBI's latest quarterly industrial trends survey reported that while the
manufacturing sector was emerging from recession, the strength of recovery
was threatened by economic slowdowns in other European countries and
disappointingly weak investment intentions.
Sir David Lees, chairman of the CBI's economic affairs committee,
acknowledged that the findings of the latest quarterly industrial trends
survey were positive but said industry was waiting to see its trends
confirmed: 'We can't yet be fully confident that the economy is on a firmly
upward path,' he said.
The survey showed that a three-year decline in total new orders came to an
end in the first four months of this year. Manufacturers, who have depleted
stocks to their lowest level for almost three years, are now expected to
increase output at the quickest pace since 1989.
Exports rose in the past four months, suggesting that the effect of
industry's competitive edge is outweighing the difficult economic conditions
of the UK's main European trading partners.
The bad news was that both investment and employment in manufacturing are
expected to continue falling, albeit at a slower rate than for most of last
year. Sir David said he thought business was being 'quite properly cautious'
and waiting to be confident of the recovery.

MCI Communications yesterday underlined its fast growth by announcing its
largest-ever contract, worth more than Dollars 250m, to be the primary
long-distance carrier for Bank of America, the second-largest US bank.
MCI, the second-largest long-distance telecommunications group in the US,
has been increasing its traffic at up to twice the industry average in
recent quarters, due to numerous new business contracts and an innovative
consumer discount programme.
The Bank of America deal is one of several important accounts it has picked
up in the financial services sector. Last May, it won a four-year, Dollars
250m contract to be the primary carrier of long-distance US voice services
for Citicorp, the largest US bank.
MCI declined to give details of the Bank of America deal but said it would
provide the company with a wide range of domestic and international voice
and data services.

FT  27 APR 93 / Patient responds to a successful prescription: The company
has changed much in the past four years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEGACY that Mr Robert Bauman and Mr Henry Wendt, respectively SmithKline
Beecham's chief executive and chairman, hand over to their successors will
be very different from the one they inherited four years ago.
At that time, the two groups that merged, SmithKline Beckman of the US and
Beecham of the UK, were also-rans in the pharmaceuticals industry. Mr Bauman
explains: 'Back four years ago, we were told the merger would never work. We
were told we didn't have a drugs pipeline. We were told we couldn't fuse a
trans-Atlantic organisation and we were told our marketing wasn't up to the
job.'
Mr Bauman claims the group he intends to hand over to Mr is now a
firmly-established leader in the industry, with an increasingly convincing
pipeline of drugs, new product growth, and a firm control of costs. A sign
of the company's improving fortunes is the attitude of SB and analysts to
the expiry in May next year of the US patents of its best-selling product,
Tagamet. A few years ago, the expiry would have been a significant cause of
concern. Analysts believe its annual sales in the US are about Dollars 600m
(Pounds 389m) and could fall 50 per cent during the first 12 months.
That decline, however, should be more than offset by the growth of SB's four
new products: Paxil, an anti-depressant also known as Seroxat; Engerix B, a
hepatitis vaccine; Kytril, an anti-nausea drug; and Relafen, an
anti-arthritic. Analysts believe these products could add sales of Pounds
400m this year - an impressive achievement by SB's combined salesforces.
The group is further protected by its particularly strong position in the
rapidly-growing American managed healthcare sector where it has about 40 per
cent of its US sales. The company was forced into the managed sector because
of competition against its existing drugs, but now sees it as a strength
rather than a weakness. It expects that proportion to increase to 80 per
cent by the end of the decade.
'Bob (Bauman) is a very modest person,' says Mr Leschly. 'Who would have
anticipated at the time of the merger that 50 per cent of pharmaceuticals
growth would come from new products, and the other 50 per cent from volume
growth of existing medicines? It's a remarkable achievement that we're
generating such growth without any price increases.'
Analysts' concerns have also been allayed by the group's strengthened
pipeline of new drugs, which has been rationalised by the group's Australian
R&amp;D director, Dr George Poste. The company has focused its resources on
fewer but potentially more financially successful medicines. Analysts point
to the group's anti-herpes compounds, penciclovir and famcyclovir, which
should challenge Wellcome's best-selling product, Zovirax, as well as
enlarging the overall market.
With its stronger pipeline and impressive marketing clout, the group is
facing the expected US healthcare reforms in the US with equanimity.
Any measures to control prices will have little effect, since the company is
already cutting prices in the US. Last year they fell by more than 2 per
cent. The company also has little exposure to any changes in the tax relief
on manufacturing in Puerto Rico.
But not all has gone to plan over the past four years. Mr Bauman admits it
took longer than expected to sell Yardley-Lentheric, the cosmetics division,
which was eventually disposed for Pounds 110m. That meant debt was higher
than expected for some time.
He also remains disappointed that the price between the US and UK stocks has
not remained within the 5 per cent range he targeted.
Other disappointments include the unsuccessful European launch of Relafen,
the anti-arthritic medicine, and the slow development of Kytril, the
anti-nausea drug.
Mr Bauman says the European launch of Relafen started before the merger and
demonstrated the need for the merger to be carried out. The drug's more
recent US launch, which involved more than 110,000 visits to general
practitioners in a single month, was highly successful, he claims.
As for Kytril, he agrees the development took longer than it should. Glaxo
has recently agreed to pay royalties for marketing its competitor compound
Zofran in anti-nausea treatment, because SB discovered its use in nausea
first. Kytril, which is licensed in only about 20 countries, had worldwide
sales last year of only Dollars 55m. Zofran has been licensed in 63
countries and generated worldwide sales of Pounds 163m during the last six
months of 1992. However, Mr Bauman says the lessons have been learned and
the later stages of development accelerated.
Mr Leschly believes Mr Bauman's influence will continue to live on after he
leaves.
Given the likely difficult environment for the industry over the next few
years, Mr Leschly must prove he can further consolidate the group's
achievements.

FT  27 APR 93 / Two jailed for oil bids racket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO OIL industry information brokers were both jailed for three years
yesterday after being convicted of bribing senior employees of British
Petroleum to obtain confidential details of contract bids.
Mr Josef Szrajber and Mr Paulo Sorelli sold information about rival bids to
engineering companies competing for lucrative North Sea oil contracts. Mr
Sorelli obtained the information and Mr Szrajber negotiated and received
customers' payments.
Last month both men were convicted at Southwark Crown Court, London, on
seven counts of conspiring to defraud BP.
Sentencing them yesterday, Judge Valerie Pearlman said: 'You quite
deliberately, as a business, pursued a course of conduct where you obtained
the information about the contents of sealed tenders so you could sell this
information to other companies competing for the award of very lucrative
contracts. What each of you did was strike at the very root of commercial
probity and that has to be treated very seriously indeed.'
They were responsible for helping companies win work worth a total of Pounds
100m. The value of the contracts varied from Pounds 625,000 to Pounds 50m.
Working on a commission basis they received Pounds 1.7m between them.
Mr Szrajber was fined Pounds 407,000 and Mr Sorelli Pounds 429,000 after it
was agreed they had benefited to that extent. Both were ordered to pay
Pounds 65,000 towards prosecution costs.

FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Shareholders seek SE Banken
shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S small shareholders, fresh from a successful campaign for greater
openness at Volvo, are pressing for a shake-up of the board at Scandinaviska
Enskilda Banken, the country's biggest bank, which was forced to seek state
support after running up an operating loss of SKr5.3bn (Dollars 705m) last
year.
Having forced Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, chairman of Volvo, to reveal details of
hitherto secret executive salaries last week, Aktiespararna, the
65,000-member national shareholders association, switched its attention to
what it sees as a failure of board control at SE Banken, in which the
Wallenberg family, Sweden's premier corporate dynasty, is the senior
shareholder.
Aktiespararna will call at the SE Banken annual meeting today for a
committee of shareholders to be set up to appoint a new board 'able to guide
the bank through the hard times still to come.'
It wants to postpone formal approval at the meeting of the present board's
actions last year to give shareholders more time to decide where
responsibility lies for the 1992 loss.
Mr Lars Milberg of Aktiespararna said shareholders should not be expected to
absolve the board of blame for the losses. 'We are not saying we have no
confidence in all of the board now, but the presumption is that the board is
responsible for the losses.'
He said his association wanted to see large institutional shareholders exert
greater control to stop 'companies ruling themselves' and to help prevent
the kinds of heavy deficits which SE Banken and Volvo have incurred.
The top three figures on the SE Banken board are Mr Curt Olsson, the
chairman, Mr Peter Wallenberg, the first deputy chairman, and Volvo's Mr
Gyllenhammar, the deputy chairman. SE Banken paid no dividend last year
after it was plunged into the red by loan losses of SKr10.9bn. It reported
that its portfolio of doubtful loans had tripled to SKr28.8bn largely due to
exposure to Sweden's crippled property market.

FT  27 APR 93 / BASF plans new plant in Belgium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BASF, the German chemicals group, is to build a new DM350m (Dollars 217m)
acrylic acid plant in Antwerp, Belgium, in a move which may spell the end of
one of the three similar facilities at its main base in Ludwigshafen.
The new plant will have a capacity of 160,000 tonnes a year and is expected
to start production in July 1995.
BASF currently produces acrylic acid, used in paints, super-absorbers for
hygiene products and sewage treatment, at three facilities in Ludwigshafen
and one in Freeport in the US.
The moves underline a growing tendency among German chemicals companies to
try to counter structural disadvantages, most notably high domestic wage
costs, by moving capacity out of the country, concentrating on further
processing of base chemicals, or simply closing uneconomic capacity.

FT  27 APR 93 / Hoechst finds itself back under media spotlight: Spillages
may force the company to tighten procedures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST Sunday morning a bright yellow cloud drifted out over the western
Frankfurt suburb of Hoechst. Around tea-time, the fire-brigade was summoned
to douse a leaking rail tanker in Offenbach, east of the city. Later that
night, Hoechst, Germany's biggest chemicals concern, was back in the
television news headlines.
The weekend's events were the latest to damage a campaign being waged by
Germany's chemical companies to persuade Bonn to reduce environmental
requirements, costing the industry DM6bn (Dollars 3.79bn) and Hoechst
DM1.6bn a year.
Recent events make it likely they will instead have to pay more to restore
confidence.
Hoechst has repeatedly promised tighter controls, but there have been 15
accidents at Hoechst since the release two months ago of a 10-tonne toxic
cocktail into the Main valley atmosphere. On that occasion 40 people were
given medical treatment, dogs were provided with protective boots, children
were ordered indoors and topsoil from gardens and allotments was carted away
for safe disposal.
By contrast, the Sunday morning cloud, resulting from a blast of 50kg of
paint and plastics pigment released through a rip in a pump filter sack, had
been speedily checked and pronounced harmless. A few dozen local residents
were issued with vouchers entitling them to have their cars cleaned at the
company's expense. In the Offenbach incident, it turned out, a 'few grams'
of sulphur dioxide had dribbled into the air 'probably' through a faulty
seal. There was no danger to people or the environment, the fire brigade
announced.
In normal circumstances the weekend's events might be classed as routine,
even unremarkable; Hoechst admits to recording up to 100 'minor' occurrences
every year within its complexes.
But the company's defensive and disorganised reaction to the incident at
Griesheim which started the current series, and a death and a serious injury
in a later accident, have generated an atmosphere charged with mistrust and
bitterness which has damaged the public standing and reputation of the whole
of Germany's Dollars 100bn chemicals industry.
Earlier this month, Mr Joschka Fischer, the regional environmental minister,
after conferring with Mr Klaus Topfer, his federal counterpart, invoked for
the first time a federal law which will subject Hoechst's environmental and
security standards and management to intensive independent scrutiny.
Failings can be punished by the withdrawal of the company's right to
continue operating plant considered unreliable.
Mr Wolfgang Hilger, chairman of Hoechst, who is also president of the VCI
chemicals industry association, has offered fulsome apologies but so far
resisted calls that he should offer his or other board members'
resignations. The only role changes likely in the immediate future will be
made among the 900 security staff employed at the main plant in Hoechst.
The full board has assumed joint responsibility for security and
environmental matters, previously the job of Mr Karl Holoubek, and set about
reviewing and revising what Mr Hilger insists is a 'state of the art'
security system, and which he claims is not being operated properly at works
level.
'We simply cannot allow our highly complicated and expensive plant, which is
risky both for employees and local people, to be operated by careless
people,' he said in an interview this week.
Nor, he added, must the workforce be allowed to lose confidence and become
even more careless because of a series of mishaps. 'When there are a couple
of bus accidents, all bus drivers become nervous - and that can lead to
mistakes,' he added.
According to preliminary findings, many of Hoechst's recent accidents have
stemmed from sources which may be attributed to careless or relaxed
application of management's vaunted state of the art rules and systems:
blocked pipes, faulty seals, torn filters, damage caused by construction
workers, overflows caused by heating compounds in unsealed containers. A
loose screw was reportedly to blame for an explosion on March 15 which
killed one man and severely injured another.
'There are people who are by their nature less careful than others. We must
find out who they are and educate them better or entrust them with other
jobs,' Mr Hilger said.
Environment minister Fischer will probably have similar thoughts as he
proceeds with his own top-level investigations.

FT  27 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DULL and mostly downward day in stock market futures, with volume levels
half of Friday's, left dealers gloomy about the short-term outlook, writes
Christopher Price.
The June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 2,845 and was initially
squeezed up. It reached 2,849 within a short period, which turned out to be
the high point of the session. Dealers said that with little new economic
news to focus on - the official end to the recession already factored in to
the price - buyers of June were few and the contract began a slow drift.
A lacklustre Wall Street failed to inspire a rally and June continued its
decline throughout the afternoon period, a fall that gathered momentum
towards the close. It finished at 2,822, just two points ahead of what is
seen as a significant resistance point for the contract.
Dealers said the downward pressure was such that further weakness could be
seen at the opening today. Should 2,820 be breached, the next resistance
point is at 2,794 and then all the way down to 2,700. The more pessimistic
futures traders are preparing for such a bout of short-term selling. The
closing level was around 5 points below current fair value of 6. Volume was
7,509 lots.
Forte topped the stock options list, with 2,020 contracts dealt. Bid
candidate United Biscuits was also busy, with 1,648 lots transacted. The
total volume was 22,056.

FT  27 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: BP upset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The substantial outperformance of British Petroleum against the wider market
and the oil sector since the turn of the year was being eroded again
yesterday as the shares continued to react to sterling's appreciation
against the dollar.
BP shares have risen more than 16 per cent since the year-end, against a 0.3
per cent decline in the FT-SE 100 Index and a 3.4 per cent rise in the
FT-Actuaries oil index.
However, the near 5 cents decline in the sterling/dollar rate in the past
couple of weeks has triggered a reappraisal of BP's earnings profile, which
is substantially affected by currency shifts. And US investors, who have
provided much of the buying in the past year or so, have pulled out of the
market in recent sessions as Wall Street has come under pressure.
BP dipped 6 to 283 1/2 p, albeit in thin turnover of 3.1m shares. Dealers
said the market had merely adjusted to the latest currency shifts plus small
profit-taking. Shell slipped 5 1/2 to 560 1/2 p with 2.3m traded.
The banks sector came back with the rest of the market, with Barclays - said
by dealers to have been overbought on Friday - retreating 9 to 431p on
turnover of 4m. Lloyds lost 8 to 523p. National Westminster performed well,
in spite of the substantial damage to its headquarters building in the City,
the shares holding 468p on good volume of 3.8m.
Bank of Scotland, the Footsie's best performing stock last week with an 11.5
per cent rise, eased 2 1/2 to 133 1/2 p. TSB, where the market is still
expecting news of a sizeable disposal, possibly of the Hill Samuel merchant
banking operation, and where there remains lingering takeover hopes, dipped
3 1/2 to 189p on heavy turnover of 6.6m shares.
Merchant banks, meanwhile, continued to move ahead, with Kleinwort Benson
the sector's best performer and climbing 7 more to break through the 400p
barrier. The stock ended at 401p, its highest closing level since March
1990.
The massive damage wrought in the City of London by the IRA bomb had little
impact on an insurance sector still fretting about last week's slide in the
equity market. Sun Alliance finished 5 lower at 325p and General Accident 7
off at 564p.
Conglomerate Suter added 5 at 144p on a press tip. Engineering group Fenner
was lifted 7 to 80p by speculation that Wassall, the mini-conglomerate run
by former Hanson executives which acquired a 1.6 per cent stake last June,
might be building up to a bid. Wassall shares held at 240p.
Supermarket group Asda continued to climb, gaining 1 1/2 at 73p in turnover
of 17m. The stock was aided by an upgrade from James Capel, which raised its
1994 profits forecast by Pounds 20m to Pounds 205m and the following year's
by Pounds 35m to Pounds 250m. The last few month's trading at the group is
said to have been encouraging.
Hoare Govett was said to be positive on Booker. The shares firmed 4 to 384p.
Internationally traded stocks with large dollar earnings suffered from the
further slide of the US currency against the pound. Siebe, which earns 60
per cent of profits in the US, fell 11 to 466p, Reuters Holdings dropped 26
to 1258p and ICI shed 20 to 1237p.
However, BAT Industries recovered 4 to 853p as several securities houses
decided recent selling was overdone.
Bank note printer De La Rue saw its highly valued shares rise a further 7 to
709p following an enthusiastic report in the US financial press. The article
highlighted the company's links with the former communist countries of
eastern Europe.
Farnell jumped 9 to 387p after preliminary results at the top end of market
estimates. Unitech moved forward 16 to 250p and Sage 23 to 619p.
Building issues provided a handful of strong perfomers, notably John Mowlem,
3 higher at 114p, and Prowting, which rose 6 to 110p.
Tarmac, reporting preliminary figures today and expected to include heavy
provisions of around Pounds 300m, lost 6 to 134p.
Talk of a UBS buy recommendation drove Rolls-Royce 3 higher to 135p.
Water shares remained under moderate selling pressure, with the Footsie
stocks attracting persistent small selling. Anglian receded 6 to 504p, North
West 5 to 496p and Severn Trent 5 to 494p.

FT  27 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Boots Plunges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shock news that Boots' heart drug could kill sent the company's shares
plunging. The fall reversed gains made earlier in the day which had been
prompted by unfortunately timed recommendations.
Several brokers were advising clients to buy stock first thing yesterday.
They have been arguing that worries over the Do-It-All chain have been
overdone and the share rating is undeservedly low.
Then, in the afternoon, Boots issued a statement on Manoplax which contained
the chilling sentence: 'Preliminary results have shown that patients
receiving the 100mg a day dose of the drug have a significantly increased
risk of death compared to those not receiving the drug.'
The shares plummeted from a high of 497p to close 29 down on the day at 464p
after unusually high turnover of 6.6m.
Analysts were generally unprepared to speak out publicly after the news but
many said the whole future of the drug was now in question. One said: 'This
is the second piece of surprise news on Manoplax. Last time it was indicated
that the placebos were more effective than the drug.' Another spoke of
'complete incompetence on the part of the management'.
Analysts had pencilled in earnings projections of around Pounds 250m for the
treatment in 1996. However, if the drug is pulled it will boost short-term
profits, which are being dragged down by spending of up to Pounds 45m in
marketing and research and development.

FT  27 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: UB bid talk gains ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS no let-up yest-erday in the takeover talk surrounding United
Biscuits as speculators rushed to buy stock amid a rash of rumours fuelled
by widespread suggestions in the weekend press. As UB shares opened sharply
higher, market attention focused on Cadbury Schweppes as the prime predatory
suspect, its shares coming under pressure on speculation that a massive
rights issue might be required to mount such a bid. Food analysts have put a
price tag of around Pounds 3.5bn on UB.
The rise in UB shares was sustained throughout the day, with the size of
individual deals suggesting that smaller speculators dominated the buying.
Investor zeal was spurred by the view of one leading securities house that
UB's break-up value in a hostile bid would be 600p a share.
In spite of the small lots being bought, there was further stake-building
speculation. On Friday, when bid rumour began to gather, there was talk that
one leading securities house was building a stake for Hanson, another
alleged predator.
Yesterday, dealers said one foreign bank was in the market bidding for 10m
UB shares, although final turnover of 8.3m suggested it had been
unsuccessful. UB, nevertheless, recorded its largest daily trading volume
since last September, and the equivalent of a further 1.6m shares were dealt
in the options market. UB finished 29 stronger at 428p.
Food manufacturing specialists remained sceptical about the affair. Mr Carl
Short at Nomura said: 'The whole thing looks like smoke without fire. None
of the companies that are being mentioned as potential bidders sound
plausible at this point.'
Other experts said that although informal discussions are thought to have
taken place between UB and Cadbury executives, the feedback from both
companies was dismissive. One analyst commented: 'It all points to a ramp in
the share price.'
Analysts' scepticism allowed Cadbury shares to partially recover, closing a
net 8 adrift at 471p. Hanson was 3 easier at 235p.

FT  27 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares hit again by nervous selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH evidence of economic recovery in the UK proved no help yesterday to a
UK stock market overshadowed by renewed firmness in sterling, which
depressed the blue chip international stocks. Second line issues suffered
only minor losses but the FT-SE 100 Index fell a further 20 points towards
the lower end of its trading range.
London's financial district spent the day coming to terms with the damage to
property and confidence inflicted by Saturday's huge bomb explosion in the
City. Securities trading appeared little affected, however, in spite of at
least one bomb scare which prompted temporary evacuation of a leading
financial house.
Confidence in the outlook for equities was challenged by further demand for
gold. In the past, this has often indicated a flight from currencies and
paper securities because of inflation fears, but London traders refused to
believe that such views are credible at present. Nervousness was compounded
by a fresh slide in the Footsie futures contract, which at the close was
challenging an important support level.
The FT-SE 100 Index ended the day 21.5 down at 2,822.3, now around 24 points
below the level at which it started the year. Market analysts admitted that
if the Footsie fails to hold at around 2,790, then it could be vulnerable
all the way down to 2,700.
The fall in the Footsie would have been greater but for another spate of bid
speculation in United Biscuits, as the shares responded to widespread hints
of an impending takeover offer either from Cadbury Schweppes or another food
industry leader.
Strategists fear that the UK stock market, currently valued on more than 14
times this year's prospective earnings, may have already discounted too much
recovery in the economy and in corporate profits and dividends.
Such fears appeared supported by a cool reception from equities yesterday to
news of a 0.2 per cent rise in UK gross domestic product in the first
quarter of the year. While this was hailed both by market analysts and Mr
Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, as convincing evidence
that the recession in the UK economy is over, it brought no perceptible
recovery from early losses in share prices.
Although off the top at the close, sterling made further progress against
both the US dollar and the German D-Mark, and falls in shares of Britain's
overseas earnings companies reflected the forced rise in their selling
prices. At the same time, firmness in the pound is now thought unlikely to
bring further reductions in UK base rates.
The second line stocks, however, continued to avoid selling pressure. At
3,133.8, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index shed only 2.4 points.
Trading volume decreased sharply yesterday, with the Seaq total reaching
only 491.9m shares compared with Friday's 700.6m. Trading in non-Footsie
stocks made up about 61 per cent of total business yesterday, maintaining
the average of recent trading sessions.
Customer, or retail, business in equities has remained at comfortably
profitable levels for the securities houses since the middle of September,
when sterling's departure from the ERM triggered the recovery in share
prices. On Friday, retail business was worth Pounds 1.23bn.

FT  27 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow lower as concern about
economy grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
INVESTORS continued to sell US stocks yesterday as concern about the outlook
for the economy deepened and share prices fell for the fifth consecutive
day, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 15.40 at 3,398.37,
the first time the index has been below 3,400 in two weeks. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 finished 3.50 lower at 433.53, while the Nasdaq composite fell
12.54, or almost 2 per cent, to 645.87 after a heavy loss in Intel. Trading
volume on the New York SE amounted to 283m shares.
Weakness in overseas stock markets, and early declines in US bond prices
(which pushed the yield on the benchmark 30- year government bond back up
through 6.8 per cent) set the tone for a downbeat opening to trading.
Sentiment was already depressed by the previous week's losses, which have
raised the spectre of a possible substantial correction in share prices.
The day's economic news was also on the gloomy side, with the National
Association of Realtors reporting that existing home sales fell 2.9 per cent
last month. Although the data were undoubtedly affected by the severe winter
storms during March, the recent string of weaker economic figures has begun
to disturb investors.
In spite of the unpromising background, prices opened higher, with the Dow
posting a double-digit gain in the first hour of trading. The markets were
unable to hold on to those gains and the afternoon was spent firmly
entrenched in negative territory.
Bank shares took a beating as more investors decided to switch out of the
sector, which has had an extremely good run this year. Some analysts have
warned recently that bank stocks may have reached their near-term highs.
Citicorp slipped Dollars 2 to Dollars 25 3/4 , Chemical Dollars 1 to Dollars
36 7/8 , BankAmerica Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 44 1/4 , Banc One Dollars 1
3/8 to Dollars 53 3/8 and Chase Manhattan Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 30 1/8 .
Although IBM performed well, improving Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 48 3/8 ,
other leading technology issues encountered heavy selling pressure. Compaq
receded Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 47 3/4 , Motorola shed Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 69 1/8 and Hewlett-Packard fell Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 70 3/4 .
Norsk Hydro was one of the market's busiest stocks, advancing Dollars 1 3/8
to Dollars 25 3/8 in volume of 12m shares after the company announced a 133
per cent jump in first-quarter net profits.
On the Nasdaq market, Intel dropped Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 87 3/8 in
volume of 11m shares on concern that Motorola will undercut Intel's prices
with a new computer chip it is developing.
Canada
TORONTO share prices ended flat in heavy turnover as Canadian markets
awaited the federal government's budget, introduced in the House of Commons
shortly after the stock exchange close.
The TSE 300 index was off just 1.6 at 3,683.8, while rises narrowly
outscored declines by 376 to 351 after volume of 81.7m shares valued at
CDollars 756.6m.
The gold shares sector recorded the day's biggest change, up 2.1 per cent,
as the New York spot gold price rose USDollars 6.20 an ounce.

FT  27 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong at a record
high as Nikkei weakens
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LATE SELLING led by the futures market pushed the Nikkei average lower in
light volume, but overall share prices ended mixed, writes Wayne Aponte in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed 80.52 down at 19,623.63, after trading between an intraday
low of 19,562.90 and a high of 19,845.60. The Topix index of all first
section issues ended 3.08 up at 1,535,77, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50
index firmed 1.33 to 1,214.27.
Volume was estimated at 300m shares, compared with Friday's 311m. Declines
led advances by 565 to 457, with 157 issues unchanged.
Brokers said that pension and postal funds managed by the government
provided support; but the early advance triggered by the flow of public
funds lost momentum as late arbitrage-related sales entered the market.
An equity analyst at a UK brokerage said investors remain cautious about
taking long positions due to worries about the direction of the yen against
the dollar. Market participants are also hoping that the G7 members will
soon take steps to stabilise the yen's appreciation. He added that trading
volume is traditionally thin and the Nikkei average's range limited shortly
before next week's Golden Week holiday.
Drug manufacturers moved higher on speculation that certain companies will
benefit from a possible regrouping of the industry. Fujisawa Pharmaceutical
climbed Y20 to Y1,030 and Nippon Chemiphar Y12 to Y884.
Investors bought non-ferrous metals issues following the recent rise in gold
prices. Sumitomo Metal and Mining, the most active issue of the day,
advanced Y63 to Y990, while Mitsui Mining and Smelting added Y14 at Y510.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which formerly led the market, appreciated
Y11,000 to Y923,000.
Consumer electronic issues advanced, TDK by Y80 to Y3,910, Pioneer
Electronic Y50 to 2,420 and Sony Y30 to Y4,730.
In Osaka, the OSE average improved 21.46 to 21,429.49 in volume of 12.4m
shares.
Roundup
THERE were some significant movers among the region's markets yesterday.
HONG KONG soared to an all-time high on hopes of an agreement over the
colony's future, as China and Britain agreed to hold a second round of talks
following the three-days of negotiations which concluded in Beijing on
Saturday.
The Hang Seng index rose 94.81, or 1.4 per cent, to 6,845.75. Although
officials have declined to announce details of the talks, investors see the
developments as positive for equities. Turnover swelled to HKDollars 6.4bn
from HKDollars 4.1bn, boosted by an HKDollars 1.27bn placement by Wharf
Holdings on Friday.
Mr Peter Bristowe at HG Asia in London said the improvement in sentiment
caused investors to focus on blue chips which had been underperforming.
SINGAPORE firmed on gains in the shipyard and banking sectors. The Straits
Times Industrial index climbed 24.19 to 1,797.26 in volume of 275.3m shares.
Traders said interest had shifted from Malaysian shares to second and third
tier Singapore issues.
AUSTRALIA surged to its highest close since January 1990 in spite of the
fact that only Victoria and Tasmania were open for business, with other
centres closed for the Anzac holiday. The All Ordinaries index rose 7.5 to
1,710.1 in low turnover of ADollars 162m.
BANGKOK was unsettled by reports that investigations into alleged share
manipulation had been widened. The SET index fell 17.58, or nearly 2 per
cent, to 883.68 in low turnover of Bt3.74bn.
TAIWAN eased, with weakness evident in the banking sector following the
postponement of First Commercial Bank's dividend. The weighted index closed
14.53 lower at 4,547.78 in thin turnover of TDollars 31.7bn. First
Commercial Bank lost TDollars 4 to TDollars 149.
MANILA recovered momentum in late trading, with a gain in PLDT lifting the
market overall. The composite index firmed 5.42 to 1,552.41. PLDT added 20
pesos at 955 pesos. Turnover was 333.9m pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR saw further profit-taking in the afternoon but the composite
index managed a rise of 1.79 to 693.44. Turnover came to 510m shares,
against Friday's 345.7m.
BOMBAY remained weak, with a fall in the BSE index of 63.86 to 2,036.81.

FT  27 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Choice of new premier pleases
Milan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL bourses were mixed yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN found the prospect of having an economist, rather than a politician,
as the next prime minister to its liking and shares rose in heavy trading.
The Comit index added 9.63 or 1.8 per cent to 541.26.
Two names were at the forefront of speculation throughout much of the day,
Mr Romano Prodi, the former chairman of IRI, the main state holding company,
and Mr Carlo Ciampi, governor of the Bank of Italy.
In the event, it was Mr Ciampi who was summoned to see President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro late in the day.
'The appointment of somebody who is not a politician will be good news for
the market,' said Mr Nicolo Braendli of Akros Sim in Milan. 'It indicates
that the old political class has reached the end.'
Domestic and foreign funds were active buyers, concentrating both on blue
chips and second liners.
Privatisation stocks mostly posted strong gains, with Credito Italiano
rising L78 or 2.6 per cent to L2,989 and Sme up L171 or 2.7 per cent to
L6,417.
Fiat turned in another strong performance fixing L129 higher at L6,989 and
breaking through the L7,000 level on the kerb to L7,070.
ZURICH was seen entering a spell of consolidation and the SMI index fell
23.7 or 1.1 per cent to 2,139.0. The mood was depressed by the weaker dollar
and scant prospects for any further easing in interest rates in the short
term.
UBS bearers, down SFr18 at SFr947, led the market lower. Bearers in CS
Holding, which holds its annual news conference in London today, shed SFr60
to SFr2,380. Export shares were led lower by Roche certificates which fell
SFr50 to SFr4,230.
PARIS saw one of its weakest days this year in terms of market turnover,
down to FFr1.7bn, as the CAC-40 index lost 4.96 to 1,911.62.
Among issues acting against the trend Peugeot built on Friday's gain with a
further rise of FFr10 to FFr574 and Elf improved FFr2.90 to FFr359.90 with
Petrofina confirming that the French group holds a stake of 4.98 per cent.
Schneider slipped FFr16 to FFr644 after reporting a slight increase in
profits and forecasting difficult trading conditions in 1993. LVMH lost FFr5
to FFr3,641 as it announced plans for a 5-for-1 share split.
FRANKFURT edged down on futures-led technical trading, while exporters
weakened on concerns of further falls in the dollar against the D-Mark. The
DAX index fell 7.29 to 1,649.81 in turnover of DM6bn. Siemens fell DM1.4 to
DM627 ahead of half year results.
BRUSSELS posted its seventh consecutive fall led by a decline in financial
issues. The Bel-20 index fell 13.44, or 1.1 per cent to 1,210.50 in thin
trading. Generale Banque fell BFr150 or 1.9 per cent to BFr7,780 on reports
that a leading shareholder was releasing its stake below the market price.
OSLO was lifted by a largest-ever ship building order for Kvaerner's Finnish
subsidiary and favourable corporate earnings news. The All share index
gained 2.93 to 455.05 in turnover of NKr569.4m. Kvaerner's B shares rose
NKr4 to NKr197. Norsk Hydro put on NKr3.50 to NKr168 on good first quarter
results.
HELSINKI continued higher on satisfaction with the outcome of the Russian
referendum. The HEX index rose 33.5 or 3 per cent to 1,152.1.
Turnover in shares and bonds so far this year also surpassed yesterday the
entire FM25.81bn turnover for 1992, the bourse said. Trading volumes have
shot up as prices soared since September 8 when the markka was floated.

FT  27 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Europe is unexcited by cut in German
rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European equity markets moved in directions of their own making for much of
last week, with the Bundesbank's unexpected cut in rates on Thursday failing
to provide much of a lift. Overall, the FT-Actuaries World index reflected
an easier trend.
Dublin exemplified the lower trend, finally giving ground after posting
gains in each of the previous eight weeks. Mr Robbie Kelleher, head of
research at Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin, notes that given the extent of the
previous rise, straight forward profit-taking was a major factor.
However, in spite of the week's decline, the overall market index so far
this year was still 25 per cent higher and prices were 40 per cent above the
low reached last October.
Mr Kelleher adds that among specific factors dragging the market lower were
AIB, which fell 3 per cent, and Bank of Ireland, 7 per cent off, mainly
reflecting a perceived weakness in future contributions of US regional bank
subsidiaries.
Fyffes gave up 11 per cent of the previous week's 30 per cent rise as it
rejected a bid by Dole, the US fresh produce company, which said it had no
plans to launch a hostile bid or to raise the value of its offer.
Smurfitt fell 10 per cent after an announcement of plans to close a Spanish
associate because of price weakness in the European markets.
Looking ahead, Mr Kelleher believes valuations of shares that have found
most foreign demand no longer look unduly cheap by international
comparisons. 'Given that these stocks dominate the market in terms of market
capitalisation, we find it difficult to see how the market as a whole can
push significantly ahead from these levels without inducing some overseas
profit-taking.'
France was also lower, in spite of a further easing by the Bank of France in
the intervention rate to 8.5 per cent after the Bundesbank's rates reduction
on Thursday.
Mr Michael Woodcock at Nikko Europe says US funds, which were buyers in
January on the assumption that the franc would be forced out of the EMS,
were taking profits. Some domestic investors were also sellers on the view
that the next rate cut might be up to three months away. He also notes that
some investors might be keeping money back for forthcoming privatisation
issues.
In the opposite direction, Finland had a good week, on the back of lower
interest rates and a positive view on the outlook for the weekend's Russian
referendum. Mrs Mary Berg of James Capel in London notes that changes at the
start of the year which removed limitations on foreign ownership of Finnish
shares had prompted foreign funds to increase their holdings in a market
widely perceived to have underperformed for the last four years.
Moreover, forestry companies with a high proportion of exports had benefited
from the weakness of the local currency.
Mr Peter Tron of Unibank in London adds that the 35 per cent advance by the
market since the start of the year and 117 per cent increase since last
September, when the markka was floated on the foreign exchanges, were not
the result of speculative pressure but reflected falling interest rates, a
positive outlook for earn-ings, and the stable economy.
Malaysia continued to benefit from changes planned in the composition of the
Morgan Stanley Capital International index from May 1, effectivly splitting
its Malaysian and Singapore stock grouping. The move, which will give
Malaysia a much larger weighting, is pulling in investment from funds which
are obliged to invest in the area.
Last week's rally, which saw the composite index around its high for the
year and posting advances on every trading day but one, confounded some
analysts who had expected the market to consolidate after the strong
performance of the previous week. Instead, prices took their cue to continue
higher from heavy demand on Monday amid reports of a big programme buying
operation.
Mr Michael Franklin of Kim Eng Securities in London notes that interest has
shifted in recent weeks from third line stocks back to recent laggards among
core stocks, and in particular Tenago, the national electricity group, and
Malaysian Telecom.

FT  27 APR 93 / Money Markets: German futures fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUTURES dealers continued to be rather pessimistic about the outlook for
German rate cuts yesterday, in spite of last week's unexpected easing in the
Bundesbank's discount rate, writes James Blitz.
Dealers in German interest rate markets are currently moved by conflicting
waves and eddies. On the one hand, good regional figures for consumer price
inflation yesterday indicated that German inflation will be a touch lower
this month after March's year-on-year figure of 4.2 per cent.
However, a good inflation figure appeared to have been priced into the
market at the start of yesterday's trading, and the impact of the news was
limited.
Dealers also said there were reasons for pessimism as trade union leaders
across Germany called for steel and engineering workers to vote for all-out
strike action in demand for higher wages.
Both the threat of strike action and fears over Germany's budget deficit
raised concern that the Bundesbank might be forced to slow the pace at which
it is reducing rates.
The June Euromark contract fell back 5 basis points yest-erday to close at
92.62, one of the lowest levels at which it has been actively traded this
year.
Although the Bundesbank has taken 100 basis points off three-month money
this year, the June contract has not kept pace with the cuts and has come
down only 40 basis points since the beginning of January.
In the German cash market, call money fell to about 7.60 per cent because of
the high level of liquidity. A cut in the Bundesbank's repo rate, currently
at around 8.11 per cent, appears certain this week to match the decline in
short-term rates.
In the sterling cash market, there was a rise in deposit rates after the
Bank of England announced a large shortage of Pounds 1.55bn which proved
difficult to remove.
The overnight rate rose as high as 7.5 per cent before late assistance of
Pounds 430m was provided. Three-month money was as high as 6 3/16 per cent
before ending at 6 1/16 per cent.
Another factor tightening rates was a rise in the cost of temporary
liquidity facilities provided by the Bank of England on a weekly basis. The
mid-market rate for these facilities was put at 6 1/4 per cent for eight
days from a previous 5 29/32 per cent.

FT  27 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Focus is back on the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR weakened to below the DM1.5700 level against the D-Mark in Europe
yesterday as dealers again turned their attention towards the sluggish
growth in the US economy, writes James Blitz.
For most of the last few trading days, the market's attention has been fixed
on the Spanish peseta, which fell through its central rate against the
D-Mark on Friday.
However, pressure on the Spanish currency towards the end of last week had
been based on speculation that there could be a devaluation of the currency
at the weekend and the pressures eased yesterday.
According to Mr Jeremy Hawkins of Bank of America in London, this allowed
dealers to catch up with both the political and economic uncertainties that
have been seen in the US in recent weeks.
President Bill Clinton's inability to get his fiscal stimulus package
ratified by the US senate has led to speculation in the markets that his
presidency is in some disarray in its first few months of office.
The economic indicators for March, which have been affected by bad weather,
have also shown a more downbeat performance than had been anticipated.
Yesterday's 2.9 per cent fall in March US home sales confirmed recent
indications that US GDP in the first quarter of this year was significantly
below the levels reached in the 1992 fourth quarter.
According to Mr Mike Gallagher of IDEA, the market information group,
dealers must wait until the April non-farm payroll data at the end of next
week before the dollar can expect to receive any stimulus.
The US currency yesterday bottomed at DM1.5645. It later closed in London at
DM1.5675 from a previous DM1.5840. In New York the dollar finally stood at
DM1.5705.
In Europe, attention was focused on the Italian lira, which had a stunning
rally on expectations that Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the governor of the Bank
of Italy, would be chosen as the next prime minister of Italy.
Mr Ciampi's nomination was received very favourably by both the currency and
bond markets, with the Italian government bonds rising 1/2 point at one
stage. The lira closed at L931.0 from a previous L941.1 per D-Mark.
Sterling broke through the DM2.50 level against the D-Mark for the first
time in three months, following a raft of positive economic indicators in
the UK.
Yesterday's figure for GDP in the first quarter, showing a 0.2 per cent rise
from the previous three months, came as a slight disappointment. The pound
later closed  1/4 pfennig down on the day at DM2.4925.
The peseta performed slightly more strongly against the D-Mark yesterday as
the Bank of Spain's 100 basis-point rise in its daily intervention rate,
announced on Friday, came into effect. After bottoming out at Pta74.05 to
the D-Mark on Friday, the Spanish currency yesterday finished in London at
Pta73.88.

FT  27 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Green
shoots hide problems under the surface - Bare patches are appearing in many
UK fields, reflecting adverse planting conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE green shoots on farms all over the country. But like some of those
alleged to relate to the British economy they can be tender plants and the
apparent evidence on the surface does not always fully reflect the reality.
For instance, crops of wheat, barley and oilseed rape planted last autumn
are now growing vigorously. As they do so the volume and height of green
material helps to hide the many problems that are a legacy of the wet
weather in which they were planted. At least they do for the casual observer
passing on the road.
Look down on the same crops from an aeroplane, or as I have done recently,
from the windows of trains travelling right across the country from east to
west, often above the fields, and the scars are still there to be seen.
There are great patches of land into which good seeds were planted but did
not grow. The soil was so wet and cold last November that they rotted
instead of germinating.
There are other bare areas in a disturbing number of fields that are clearly
the work of pests - almost certainly slugs. The slug problem has become much
worse in recent years as more farmers have turned to chopping straw behind
their combined harvesters instead of burning it - a practice now banned by
law. Chopped straw is attractive fodder for slugs, enabling them to thrive
and reproduce to ever increasing numbers.
Collectively the patches amount to a sizeable area of the country and it is
already clear that many cereal and oilseed rape fields affected by one or
both of these problems will not fulfil their potential.
Add to that the fact that the Ministry of Agriculture's December census
recently revealed that 19 per cent fewer acres of autumn cereals were
planted last year because of a combination of the wet weather and the
European Community's new set-aside regulations and it can be seen that the
UK harvest of autumn sown crops this year is likely to be significantly
reduced. Indeed some trade sources have put the reduction at some 2m tonnes,
equivalent to about 10 per cent of last year's total harvest.
Within the constraints of set-aside, however, it is probable that some of
this may be made up by spring sowings. These have increased, mainly on land
originally intended for autumn planting, and in most cases they have gone
into excellent seed-beds and, following timely rains, have grown away well.
Spring-sown barley, peas, beans, sugar-beet and oilseed rape have all
benefited from the kind spring, although unusually for spring problems with
slugs are continuing in some areas. But all other things being equal and the
weather over the next few weeks permitting, yields from these crops should
be above average come August.
Livestock farmers too are having a good spring. Grass is growing well,
bringing the promise of plentiful seed through the summer as well as hay and
silage for next winter, and sheep farmers all over the country are reporting
the best lambing they have had for several years.
There are economic green shoots as well. The price of finished lambs, for
instance, is higher than it has been since the removal of the EC's variable
guarantee scheme nearly eighteen months ago. This is mainly because of
growing demand for English lamb in Italy and France and the fact that their
normal alternative sources in eastern Europe cannot supply because of ethnic
conflicts.
However, the greatest impact on UK farming this year has come from the
withdrawal of sterling from the exchange rate mechanism last September and
the subsequent devaluation. According to EC rules this discrepancy with
other community currencies had to be made up to British farmers through the
so-called 'green' currency system.
This has meant that prices of EC-supported commodities have at their peak
been increased by around 20 per cent, which more than cancelled out the
initial price reductions imposed by CAP reforms. Potentially it has also
increased area and set-aside compensation payments for the same reasons.
The crucial day, however, is July 1. For the value of sterling against other
EC currencies on that day will decide the level of those payments for the
coming year.
Needless to say farmers are hoping the pound will not recover too fast. They
have already seen guaranteed prices of grain rise to Pounds 20 tonne more
than they expected last harvest only to see those levels eroded by Pounds 5
a tonne in recent weeks as sterling has recovered. Further revaluations
leading to further price reductions are on the cards over coming weeks. Even
so commodities have been sold this year, both spot and forward, at prices
higher than farmers dared hope. Devaluation-induced windfall profits have
been and will be made. And when farmers have money they will spend it, as
tractor manufacturers have once again been reminded.
It has been reported by the Agricultural Engineers' Association that in the
first quarter of 1993 tractor registrations were 13 per cent higher than for
the same period last year. This followed several years of declining sales
and urgent replacement of ageing machines was therefore needed on many
farms. But the fact that many of the deals are being done on hire purchase
also reflects that farmers are alive to the fact that they can lock in
interest rates now lower than for a long time and that capital allowances
have been raised in the Budget from 25 per cent to 40 per cent.
It is however significant to learn that sales of tackle have dried to a
trickle in the last couple of weeks. Dealers believe this is almost entirely
because of the dreaded 'Domesday forms' that farmers are having to complete
to qualify for compensation for the equally unpopular set-aside. They have
spent so long stuck behind their desks or queueing for Ordnance Survey maps
that they have been unable to spare the time to buy, dealers say.
So, while the combination of spring and sterling's devaluation have led at
least to a partial recovery of confidence in British agriculture it is at
best patchy and there are real fears that worse may be to come. Last week
Copa, the Confederation of European Farmers' Unions, alleged that the Gatt
settlement on farm commodities negotiated between the EC and the US in
anticipation of a full agreement later would if implemented lead to a
massive extension of set-aside.
Mr Rene Steichen, the EC agriculture commissioner, denied that this would be
the case and said that any modifications to farm production could be
accommodated within last year's CAP reform package. But farmers, always
suspicious of politicians' promises, remain unconvinced.

SEVERAL BASE metals tested overhead resistance levels yesterday and although
the barriers were not breached further assaults were likely in the immediate
future, London Metal Exchange traders said. The three months COPPER contract
was twice driven up towards its Dollars 1,920-a-tonne target and held at
that level at the second attempt to register a gain at the kerb close of
Dollars 28 from Friday. Dealers noted narrowing forward premiums had aided
the bounce from recent lows, and some were beginning to talk about possible
supply disruption associated with forthcoming labour contract negotiations
in Chile and the US. Three months ZINC moved up with copper to end at
Dollars 1,028 a tonne, up Dollars 2. NICKEL's rally was halted, however,
after the three months price had added nearly Dollars 70 to last week's
Dollars 235 upsurge. Having failed to break through strong resistance the
price subsided to finish little changed at Dollars 6,170 a tonne. London
robusta COFFEE prices regained last week's losses as the New York arabica
market gave the lead. But sterling's strength kept COCOA under pressure.

EUROPEAN COMMUNITY agriculture ministers last night held out little hope of
reaching agreement this week as they started talks on farm prices and milk
quotas for 1993-94, reports Reuter from Luxembourg.
Although the Danish EC presidency was pressing hard for agreement, few
ministers believed a deal was now likely because of the political
uncertainty in Italy and a new French government.
'It's quite hard to see we'll get solutions in these circumstances,' said Mr
John Gummer, the UK minister of agriculture
The commission has proposed a relatively modest price package with
reductions for cereals and other products agreed under last year's farm
reforms, and a freeze for most other items.
Milk quotas would be unchanged except for Italy, Spain and Greece which
would get increases. Butter prices would fall 5 per cent.
Danish officials said they would still try to forge a deal even if it meant
stretching the meeting over several days.

methanol plant

<TEXT>
STATOIL, THE Norwegian state oil company, warns that costs for a NKr2.4bn
(Pounds 225m) methanol plant to be built on the west coast of mid-Norway are
threatening to escalate by several hundred million kroner, prompting a
comprehensive and critical review of the project.
The potential increase poses questions about the future of the NKr25bn
Heidrun oil and gas field development and a NKr3bn methyltertiary butyl
ether project. MTBE is used as an additive to boost the octane level of
unleaded petrol.
Statoil has an 82 per cent interest in the proposed methanol plant and
partners Conoco Norway and parent company du Pont de Nemours have 18 per
cent through the Statoil Methanol ANS partnership.
An estimated 650m cubic metres of gas annually is meant to be supplied to
the plant to allow it to produce 830,000 tonnes of methanol a year. The
plant is planned to supply 200,00 tonnes annually of feedstock to a proposed
MTBE plant allowing annual output of 500,000 tonnes.
Statoil stresses that the cost over-run figures are uncertain but, because
it takes such a serious view of the matter, a full appraisal of the project
will be undertaken with findings to be presented in June.

FT  27 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Finland's farming Euro-sceptic
in EC hot seat: The choice of an ex-farm union chief as foreign minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE Finnish government wanted to send Brussels a strong signal about the
importance it attaches to agriculture in its negotiations on European
Community membership, it could not have done better than appoint Mr Heikki
Haavisto as its new foreign minister.
He takes up the post on May 4, having been president of the influential
Central Union of Agricultural Producers. He is well-known for his anti-EC
views, which accord with those of the Finnish farming community as a whole.
Giving him a key role in the negotiating process is a shrewd move by the
government, not least because the dominant coalition partner, the Centre
Party, traditionally draws its support from rural areas. But it is a risky
strategy too. If the government can get a deal of which Mr Haavisto approves
it will have gone a long way to easing the membership doubts of the farming
community. If it cannot get such a deal opposition to EC membership, which
opinion polls put at about 38 per cent, might grow.
It is, perhaps, surprising that agriculture has become the key issue in
Finland's EC membership discussions. The country has only about 170,000
farmers, corresponding to just 7 per cent of its workforce. Finnish
agriculture is also a huge consumer of subsidies and support, costing the
taxpayer about FM7bn (Pounds 830m) a year, and food prices are high.
Farming's importance is not so much economic as psychological in a land
where the countryside is regarded as an essential part of national identity
and cultural heritage. It also overlaps with regional, conservation and
defence considerations, particularly given the security sensitivities
aroused by Finland's 1,300-km (800-mile) border with Russia.
What Finland wants is recognition of the special difficulties and costs of
agricultural production in a country where the growing season is less than
180 days and distances to markets are often huge.
Under the existing Brussels regime, support would fall away dramatically,
according to Mr Haavisto. A small dairy farm in the north of the Finland,
for which direct support and price subsidies now amount to FM94,200 a year,
would get only FM11,700 under EC rules. A southern farm's support would
shrink from FM39,700 a year to FM9,800.
There are plenty of reasons to believe that a suitable compromise can be
found. After all, Finland is not a production problem, as far as the EC is
concerned, and it will not add to existing surpluses. Nor is it a special
regime problem, as the EC has proved flexible in the past in adapting to new
situations. It may simply end up being a transition and funding problem -
whether it is Brussels or the national government that meets the continuing
subsidy cost.
Feelings on the agriculture issue are running high in Finland today because
of sensitivity about adding to unemployment, which is already about 18 per
cent of the workforce. But there is a chance that as the economy improves
those fears will become less important for much of the non-farming
population than the issue of high food prices. Certainly, there are many who
would be reluctant to see the whole question of Finland's EC membership
becoming dependent on agriculture alone.
In reality the country's farming industry is shrinking anyway. Even Mr
Haavisto accepts that 10,000 of Finland's 120,000 farms will disappear this
decade irrespective of EC membership.

FT  27 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: International financiers spark
off gold price surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONCERTED effort by some of the world's high-profile financiers to focus
investors' attention on gold paid off yesterday when the price moved up by
USDollars 7.35 troy ounce in London to close at a six-month peak of Dollars
351.50.
This followed weekend revelations that Mr George Soros, renowed for making
more than Dollars 1bn profit in the currency markets in September by betting
against sterling and the Italian lira, had bought Dollars 400m-worth of
shares in Newmont Mining, biggest of the North American gold producers.
The Newmont shares were sold by Lord Rothschild, the UK investor, and Sir
James Goldsmith, the international deal-maker. Sir James revealed he had
used the cash to purchase more than Dollars 300m of options to buy gold in
the London and New York markets.
The news 'had gold bugs coming out of the woodwork left, right and centre'
yesterday, according to one trader.
Mr Jon Bergtheil, analyst at James Capel, the financial services group,
heralded the involvement of Mr Soros in the gold market as 'a fascinating
development. I have felt for some time that the negative impact of central
bank selling (of gold) would soon be countered by the entry of specialised
investors. There is now a very definite shift in market psychology, and the
gold market is all about psychology'.
Some other commentators were more cynical. One pointed out, unkindly, that
'Goldsmith has made a song and dance ahead of buying 700,000 to 800,000
ounces of gold - that alone should stimulate some buying by other
investors'.
Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland, speculated that the
deals and the accompanying publicity might be part of a much grander
strategy as far as Mr Soros was concerned, perhaps connected with his
rumoured bond market positions. (Rumours suggest Mr Soros has been shorting
US bonds or selling bonds he does not yet own in the expectation that he
will be able to buy them later at a lower price.)
He said that the timing of the gold deals was perfect because 'troubles in
South Africa and Russia (the biggest and third-biggest gold producers
respectively) are coming to a head at the same time and the (German)
Bundesbank has cut its interest rates'.
Analysts said the gold price surge yesterday was helped by producers
resisting the temptation to do some forward selling. 'But they will start to
sell again when the price rise shows signs of stalling,' suggested Mr Ted
Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group.
He added: 'To put the market in perspective, gold might be at a six-month
high, but a few weeks ago it was at a seven-year low'. Mr Arnold said the
market was being driven by professionals, investment funds and the like, and
'there has been no wave of physical buying by the man in the street, Asians
are not falling over each other to buy at these prices and the Swiss banks
are still not putting their private clients into physical gold. And if the
physical buying is not there, it will be difficult to sustain a high price'.
Both Mr Smith and Mr Arnold said that market professionals would now be
looking at chart points and setting targets. Mr Smith suggested Dollars 360
an ounce was probably the next target. Mr Arnold said it was difficult to
judge where the price would peak but many people were targetting Dollars
360-Dollars 370.

FT  27 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Italian rally greets easing of political
uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN government bonds rallied yesterday as the market welcomed the
appointment of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor of the Bank of Italy, as
prime minister designate.
The half-point advance - with the BTP futures contract up by 47 basis points
to 97.22 - was fuelled partly by relief at the end to uncertainty after the
resignation of Giuliano Amato's government last Thursday and partly by the
market's approval of Mr Ciampi.
He is regarded as a strong defender of the lira and as lending weight to
efforts to cut the budget deficit. His lack of political experience was seen
as an advantage by some.
GERMAN government bond prices fell by nearly half a point on concerns over
disappointing inflation figures and anxiety over the situation in Bosnia.
Inflation was at the high end of expectations - in Hesse, the rate rose to 5
per cent. Last week's cuts in the Lombard and discount rates have diluted
interest in today's announcement on the repo rate, expected by some dealers
to fall below 8 per cent.
THE PROSPECT of further interest rate cuts in France is dominating the
French government bond market, helping the shorter end to hold up quite well
while demand is thin for longer-dated stock. This was reflected in a
widening of spreads between French and German 10-year benchmarks, while the
short end - bonds due 1994, for instance - saw a narrowing in yield spreads.
IN THE UK, news of a third quarter of growth in gross domestic product
caused few ripples in the UK government bond market. Excluding oil and gas,
a rise of 0.6 per cent, compared with the fourth quarter of 1992, was seen
as confirming that economic recovery is under way.
Economists have turned their attention to the associated potential
drawbacks: rising inflation rates, growth in the trade deficit and the
possibility that the next move in interest rates will be up rather than
down.
Bearish tendencies have been to the fore ahead of tomorrow's auction of
Pounds 3bn of 7 1/4 per cent bonds due 1998. But, with a pattern established
of prices making up some lost ground before each day's close, there is
clearly support at the cheaper levels.
Both the 7 1/4 per cent gilt due 1998 and the 9 per cent gilt due 2008 ended
the day less than  1/4 point down after losing nearer half a point in the
morning.
THE Spanish bond market's worries, centring on the continued attack on the
peseta, were intensified by reports of the Bank of Spain's low reserves.
This has raised the spectre of a reimposition of exchange controls which
caused a flight from the bond market last autumn.
US TREASURY prices eased at the long end yesterday but shorter-dated
maturities mostly held their ground as dealers and investors kept a watchful
eye on higher precious metals and commodity prices.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  13/32 at
103 13/16 , yielding 6.821 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was only slightly weaker, down  1/32 at 100 7/32 , to yield
3.738 per cent. Trading was extremely quiet, said dealers.
The recent rise in gold prices has unnerved the bond market, especially
reports over the weekend that Mr George Soros, the billionaire money
manager, was moving some of his money out of bonds and into gold interests.
Investors reportedly have been moving into gold as a safe haven during
uncertainty over the outcome of the referendum in Russia.
The market was also worried by a small uptick in the Commodity Research
Bureau's index of commodity prices.
On the economic front, news of a 2.9 per cent decline in March existing home
sales had little impact on sentiment. Once again, the weakness in the data
was attributed primarily to the effect on the housing market of last month's
severe winter storms.
One other factor affecting prices yesterday was awareness of supply
pressures, in the shape of today's auction of Dollars 15.25bn in two-year
notes and tomorrow's auction of Dollars 11bn in five-year notes.
THE JAPANESE government bond market remained quiet in the absence of new
data and ahead of the Golden Week holidays which start on Thursday.
Economists said the fundamentals remained favourable to bonds. Economic
weakness, including fears that the strong yen would undermine recovery, was
expected to show through in retail sales figures, out today, and in flat
levels of industrial production. On Friday, inflation figures may show rates
of less than 1 per cent.

FT  27 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Argentina looks for up to
Dollars 11bn - The country is exploiting its higher standing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA is returning to international financial markets in force. The
country - or its private sector, since companies are doing most of the
fund-raising - is expected to raise between Dollars 8bn and Dollars 11bn in
foreign capital to cover this year's current account deficit. Last year, it
raised about Dollars 8bn.
Argentine companies last year sold bonds worth Dollars 1.91bn on local and
international markets, nearly twice as much as in 1991. In the first quarter
of this year alone, companies raised a further Dollars 1.43bn through bond
sales. Officials at the Comision Nacional de Valores (CNV), the capital
markets watchdog, believe a further Dollars 3bn of corporate debt could be
placed this year locally and overseas.
Argentine companies are turning to foreign debt markets because
international interest rates are lower and maturities longer than locally.
Deregulation in Argentina also allows companies to sell paper in local and
international markets simultaneously.
Foreigners have bought about Dollars 1.8bn in shares listed on the Buenos
Aires stock exchange since 1991. Last year, three companies raised another
Dollars 1.52bn through international equity placements, including American
Depositary Receipts. CNV officials say companies could raise another Dollars
1bn through local and international equity programmes this year.
Privatisation issues will remain a leading attraction for overseas capital.
The government hopes an initial public offering this summer of half of YPF,
the national oil company, will raise at least Dollars 2bn. The government
could raise another Dollars 2.5bn to Dollars 4bn through the sale of
minority stakes in companies already privatised. Last year, privatisations
attracted Dollars 4.12bn from abroad.
Argentina's standing in financial markets has improved steadily. On April 7,
the government and creditor banks reached agreement on reducing its Dollars
29bn bank debt. Actual interest payments rose because the government was
previously servicing only part of its debt, but the agreement enhanced
Argentina's status and was expected to help to further reduce risk premiums
on new Argentine borrowings.
But some investors are impatient over often insufficient and sometimes
misleading information companies provide. Analysts warn companies could find
raising money more difficult unless business dealings become more
transparent.
Analysts say loose accounting regulations allow companies to hide profits
from minority shareholders and tax authorities. Complex shareholding
structures can conceal a company's real owners. Inadequate balance sheets
make it hard to monitor management. Estimating real liabilities and assets
is equally difficult.
The CNV is trying to improve management accountability. It recently ordered
Perez Companc, Argentina's third-largest listed company, to restate its 1992
accounts because the CNV suspected it of concealing profits.
The CNV also ticked off Molinos Rio de la Plata, part of the Bunge y Born
food giant, for not explaining adequately an item in its accounts called
'payments to third parties' that consumed nearly Dollars 26m in the second
half of 1992 - about 6 per cent of turnover.
Some companies may already be finding it harder to raise money overseas.
Bunge y Born recently had to pull a unit's international share offering
after poor investor reaction.
Investors hope Argentina will follow Chile and Mexico, which are cutting
down on abuses. Mr Martin Redrado, CNV president, says this is happening. He
says: 'There is less (manipulation) now than a year ago, and in a year's
time there will be even less.'
The government hoped proposals for a private pension fund system would add
depth to local capital markets. But the proposals are being diluted in
Congress, meaning Argentina's reliance on foreign capital will continue.

FT  27 APR 93 / International Bonds: Strong demand underpins more French
franc issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Eurobond market continues to see a steady stream of French franc issues
as borrowers try to take advantage of lower interest rates and strong
investor demand.
Yesterday, the European Coal and Steel Community launched a FFr1.5bn 10-year
Eurobond and Deutsche Bank Finance launched a FFr2bn bond with a three-year
maturity. The deals follow closely on the Kingdom of Norway's FFr3bn
five-year bond issue launched last Friday.
Dealers pointed out that demand for French franc-denominated paper is still
strong as investors expect the currency to remain firm while French interest
rates are likely to be cut further. The Bank of France has already cut
interest rates since the centre-right election victory, with the latest fall
announced on Friday.
The European Coal and Steel Community is not a frequent borrower in the
French franc sector of the Eurobond market, and BNP, the lead manager and
book-runner, claimed this 'rarity' factor enabled the deal to be
aggressively priced at a spread of 15 basis points over the mid-price of the
10-year OAT. BNP reported good demand for the triple-A rated paper from
Europe and eastern Asia.
The bonds rose from the fixed price re-offer of 97.785 to 97.82 by
mid-afternoon. The funds are being passed on directly to a client and will
be kept in French francs.
Deutsche Bank Finance, which also tapped the French franc sector, said it
would be swapping the proceeds of its FFr2bn issue into floating-rate funds.
Some of the recent French franc bonds have been swapped into floating rate
francs or into dollars, as swap opportunities have improved.
The other main feature of the Eurobond market yesterday was the launch of
two 'collared' floating-rate note issues - from ING Bank and Merrill Lynch.
Morgan Stanley, lead manager for ING's Dollars 100m 10-year deal, said
demand for these instruments remains strong. The deal has a minimum coupon
of 5.1875 per cent and a maximum of 8.125 per cent. 'The floor is well above
short-term interest rates, so people are willing to cap their upside in
return for a high floor,' the lead manager said.
The recent flood of Latin American deals continued yesterday, with a 2 1/2
 year Dollars 50m bond from Banco Bradesco, the largest private bank in
Brazil. Lead manager Deutsche Bank said the bonds were mainly bought by
specialist Latin American funds and Swiss banks.

SEIBU, the Japanese department store group, announced yesterday that sales
had fallen below those of Mitsukoshi, its main rival, for the first time in
five years, writes Charles Leadbeater in Tokyo.
Seibu, which is privately owned, took the unprecedented step of publishing a
financial report. It announced it had made its first ever pre-tax
unconsolidated loss in the year to end-February. It was the first loss at
the group since its founding in 1940.
The loss was mainly due to a scandal involving medical equipment, which
forced Seibu into an extraordinary loss of Y19.7bn (Dollars 175m).

INTEL'S stock price dropped sharply yesterday, on concerns that the
semiconductor manufacturer will face increasing price competition in the
market for microprocessors used in personal computers.
Intel currently dominates this market but yesterday Motorola, the second
largest manufacturer, announced its entry into the field with the launch of
its first Power PC microprocessor, developed in conjunction with IBM and
Apple Computer. Motorola said that it will price the first Power PC chip at
Dollars 280, for customers ordering 20,000 chips. A faster version will be
priced at Dollars 374.
'Our goal is to make the PowerPC a standard in the computer industry,' said
Motorola.
Prices for Intel's 486 microprocessor, its leading product, range from
Dollars 90 to Dollars 550, depending upon the speed and packaging of the
chip. Next month, Intel is expected to price its new Pentium microprocessor
at about Dollars 900.
Intel's shares dropped by Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 87 3/8 yesterday, while
Motorola lost Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 69 1/8 . Advanced Micro Devices also
retreated to Dollars 29 1/4 , down Dollars 1 1/4 .

FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Matra-Hachette swings back into
black for year

<TEXT>
MATRA-HACHETTE, the French group formed late last year by the merger of the
Matra defence electronics business with Hachette's media interests,
yesterday confirmed that it returned to the black in 1992 with a net profit
of FFr354m (Dollars 65m) against a FFr1.68bn loss in 1991, and forecast a
sharp increase in profits for 1993.
Mr Philippe Camus, chairman of the group's financial council, said
Matra-Hachette was considering ways of further streamlining its interests.
One option is believed to be a merger with the Lagardere group, the company
chaired by Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, which controls Matra-Hachette.
Lagardere also returned to profit last year by making FFr96m against a net
loss of FFr448m in 1991, when it was hit by Hachette's losses on La Cinq,
the failed French television station. It has raised its dividend from
FFr1.50 to FFr2.20.
The merger of Matra and Hachette, which was highly controversial when first
announced due to the apparent incompatibility of the two companies, has been
followed by the pooling of their head office functions. It has also
accelerated operational restructuring in terms of asset sales.
Matra-Hachette saw turnover rise from FFr53.11bn in 1991 to FFr55.1bn in
1992 with operating profits up from FFr2.32bn to FFr2.78bn. The 1991 figures
have been restated to allow for the merger.
The group also benefited from a sharp fall in exceptional losses from
FFr2.19bn in 1991 (when Hachette was hit by La Cinq's collapse) to FFr391m
last year, representing asset sales and restructuring costs. However
financial losses rose from FFr892m to FFr1.05bn over the same period.
Matra-Hachette is paying a dividend of FFr2.20 a share.

WIELKOPOLSKI Bank Kredytowy, Poland's first state-owned 'high street' bank
to be sold off, has been heavily oversubscribed, according to the finance
ministry.
Mr Slawomir Sikora, the head of the ministry's banking department, said
710bn zlotys (Dollars 42m) had been offered for the 460,000 shares with
total a issue price 52.9bn zlotys.
All foreign and local private sector buyers have been issued shares but only
9.2 per cent of the amount they had applied for.
This issue represents 10 per cent of the existing capital. However, the
bank's capital will be expanded when the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development invest Dollars 12.7m to acquire a 28.5 per cent stake.
State-sector company applications for 1m shares in the tranchee were not
considered. No investor has been permitted to buy more than 1 per cent of
the bank's entire equity.
Almost one-fifth of the tranchee was sold to foreign investors, who include
several banks. The sale has coincided with an unprecedented rally on the
Warsaw stock exchange, which has seen turnover in daily trading in its 16
quoted stocks more than treble since the beginning of last month to
yesterday's 203bn zlotys.
Today sees the opening of the public sale of a further 1,280,000 shares
priced at 115,000 zlotys each in the 'small' investor tranchee.

ITALGAS, the Italian gas and drinking water group, reported a L10bn fall in
net profits to L81bn (Dollars 53m) for 1992 following weaker sales which
eased to L3,381bn from L3,353bn.
The company blamed the mild winter, which had reduced gas demand, and higher
tax. It is holding the dividend at L100 a share.
Earnings were also held back by the freezing of gas prices, which have not
been raised since July 1991. Mr Carlo Da Molo, chairman, warned that an
increase in charges, even below the rate of inflation, was now
'indispensable'.
Italgas's client base rose by 155,000 units to 4.5m, though the volume of
gas sales remained little changed.
Sales in the drinking water business area grew more sharply, with a 10 per
cent increase in water supplies.
Italgas continued its diversification into refuse disposal, its still little
developed, business division, with the purchase of a 49 per cent stake in
Aimeri. The company is the leading private operator in the field.
Although net interest charges fell markedly to L18bn from L51bn in 1991, the
company reported a substantial downturn in extraordinary items owing to the
devaluation of the lira.
Dalmine, the stock market listed steel tubemaker controlled by the Ilva
state steel concern, reported a rise in net group profits to L5.6bn last
year from L5bn in 1991 in spite of the crisis in the European steel
industry.
The company, in which Ilva controls about 69 per cent of the shares, is set
to be privatised under the latest rescue plan for group, which lost L2,309bn
in 1992.

FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Toshiba sells audio unit stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOSHIBA, the Japanese electronics manufacturer, has sold its 69 per cent
stake in Onkyo, a specialised audio manufacturer, the company said.
The decision to sell the stake in Onkyo highlights the restructuring that is
in progress among Japanese corporations and the pressure that the domestic
slowdown is putting on traditional equity relationships in Japan.
Toshiba sold its holding in Onkyo to the president of a medium-sized
manufacturer of auto parts who expressed interest in buying the stake
through an M&amp;A firm affiliated with Nomura Securities.
Onkyo is an established audio manufacturer which has suffered from the
downturn in the consumer electronics market both in Japan and in other
industrialised economies.
Toshiba had been attempting to restructure the business. Last year, it made
a net loss of Y320m (Dollars 2.89m) and a programme to cut costs by reducing
its workforce, moving out of unprofitable businesses and increasing orders
from Toshiba was outlined last July.
However, Onkyo is expected to report a 12 per cent drop in sales to Y45bn in
the year ended 993 and a loss for the period.
Toshiba will continue to support Onkyo by marketing the audio-makers'
products through its own retail store network. Financial assistance and a
loan made to Onkyo will also be continued, Toshiba said.
The move by Toshiba reflects a changing attitude among Japanese corporations
on equity relationships as the economic slowdown puts increasing pressure on
them to offload unprofitable businesses. It points to the likelihood of an
accompanying increase in possibilities for mergers and acquisitions opening
up in Japan.

FLETCHER Challenge Canada, 63 per cent owned by Fletcher Challenge, the New
Zealand conglomerate, reports a sharp reduction in third-quarter losses to
CDollars 6.7m (USDollars 5.3m) compared with CDollars 24.3m for the same
period last year, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. Sales rose 39 per cent to
CDollars 318.6m.
Mr Doug Whitehead, president, said the result reflected substantially
improved market conditions for solid wood products, better prices for
lightweight paper and higher sales volumes for newsprint. The improvement in
results would have been even better but for a deterioration in pulp prices.
For the nine months ended March 1993, net losses were CDollars 30.3m, up
from CDollars 23.4m. The 1992 results included a non-recurring after-tax
gain of CDollars 35.3m.

BANCO BILBAO Vizcaya (BBV), Spain's biggest banking group, raised
first-quarter net income by 4.4 per cent to Pta17bn (Dollars 147m),
indicating a return to growth following a fall in income last year.
Operating profit rose 7.3 per cent to Pta36.7bn and ordinary profit rose
10.4 per cent to Pta21.8bn. Last year, the group's net profits were held in
check by a 42 per cent drop in extraordinary income.
BBV claimed that it was continuing its 1992 trend of increasing its share of
the banking sector's deposits and borrowed funds. Customer deposits stood at
Pta6,200bn, 10 per cent up on the first three months of last year.
The results were moderate in comparison with the 8.1 per cent and 6.1 per
cent first-quarter profit rises that were reported last week by Banco
Santander and Banco Popular respectively, but they were welcomed by
analysts.
'If BBV's operating profit continues to grow, the bottom line will not drop
this year and the quality of results will improve,' said one analyst
yesterday.
The state-run Spanish electricity utility, Empresa Nacional de Electricidad
SA (Endesa), said its net profit rose 10 per cent to Pta33.1bn in the first
quarter of 1993.

WHARF, the diversified Hong Kong conglomerate, is to bid HKDollars 1.22bn
(USDollars 158m) for the minorities in Harbour Centre Development, its
listed hotels subsidiary which operates the Omni chain of hotels.
Wharf already owns 56 per cent of Harbour Centre, with the Kadoorie family
owning 10.7 per cent through Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels and the remaining
33.3 per cent in the hands of the public.
Wharf will bid HKDollars 9 a share cash. This represents a 15 per cent
premium on Harbour Centre's pre-bid price of HKDollars 7.87, but a
substantial discount on the company's net asset value.
This is reckoned to be HKDollars 12.83 a share by Baring Securities and
HKDollars 11.90 a share by Wardley James Capel. A simple average of the two
valuations - HKDollars 12.36 - means Wharf's offer is at a discount of 27
per cent.
Wharf has funded the offer by placing 65m shares at HKDollars 19.50 each
with institutions. This raised HKDollars 1.27bn.
Harbour City has embarked on a recent series of acquisitions in the US and
Wharf said yesterday that it considered funding for these projects would be
substantially enhanced if Harbour City were to become wholly-owned.

ASEA Brown Boveri, the Swiss multinational, has acquired 40 per cent of
Taylor Instrument (India), the Indian instrumentation company owned by the
Birla group.
The deal leaves the Birlas owning 41 per cent of the venture, to be called
Birla Kent Taylor Instrument. The remaining 19 per cent will be held by the
government-owned Unit Trust of India and the Life Insurance Corporation.
The Indian company, which has a turnover of Rs600m (Dollars 19m) and an
equity base of Rs15m, will use its tie-up with ABB to increase exports.
Officials say the company's turnover should touch Rs800m in the next two
years.
Century Textiles and Industries, the textiles, cement and shipping group
owned by the Birlas, reported a 28 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to
Rs1.74bn for the year ended March, 1993 on sales 9 per cent ahead at
Rs11.97bn, writes RC Murthy in Bombay.
The operations of Century Rayon, the group's synthetic fibre division, have
been partially closed following criminal charges over alleged pollution from
a plant near Bombay.

FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Five resign from Hyogo Bank
board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE board members resigned yesterday at Hyogo Bank, a local Japanese bank,
taking responsibility for the institution's deteriorating bad loan burden,
reportedly the worst among regional Japanese banks.
Mr Minoru Yamada, the bank's president, is among those to resign, and will
be replaced by Mr Masateru Yoshida, a former director-general of the banking
bureau at the ministry of finance.
The appointment of a former official of Mr Yoshida's calibre highlights the
difficulties at Hyogo Bank, based in the western city of Kobe. The bank was
crippled by its lax control over financial affiliates, which pumped funds
into property-related projects during the late-1980s.
Hyogo has become a symbol of the over-ambitiousness of some Japanese
regional banks, which expanded beyond their home territory during the late
1980s and were big lenders to property developers and, in some cases, stock
market speculators.
However, Hyogo was not alone in using so-called 'non-bank affiliates' to
cultivate customers outside the traditional range. Much of the bad loan
burden faced by big city banks is also linked to the lending of affiliates.
The bank's 10 largest affiliates have outstanding loans of Y1,600bn, and an
increasing percentage of these loans are turning bad. Hyogo has also
accepted reduced interest payments from customers which have avoided
collapse, but which are in need of intensive care.
The extent of Hyogo's problems are such that the Bank of Japan has pumped in
loans at the official discount rate, now 2.5 per cent, allowing the troubled
bank to profit from the difference in market rates. Central bank officials
were concerned that there could be a run on Hyogo after its deposits fell
16.5 per cent in the first half last year.
Hyogo is expected to announce another restructuring programme tomorrow as
the present plan, scheduled to last until 2002, has been unable to stabilise
the bank. Apart from Mr Yamada, who announced the resignations, Mr Nobuo
Ishikawa, the vice-president, and Mr Tamenobu Nakatsu, senior managing
director, will leave the bank.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEN NORSKE BANK, Norway's biggest commercial bank, has opened talks aimed at
acquiring Oslobanken, the troubled Oslo-based concern.
Oslobanken warned last month that it would fall short of capital adequacy
requirements during the first quarter, and its shares were suspended.
DnB, which is 70 per cent state-owned, said earlier this month it was not
interested in acquiring Oslobanken, but the state-backed Bank Insurance Fund
has urged DnB to reconsider to at least acquire part of Oslobanken. In the
meantime, the central bank is prepared to provide liquidity support to
Oslobanken.
DnB has initiated a due diligence process before deciding on an Oslobanken
move. Oslobanken is expected soon to report poor quarterly results. In 1992,
it made a pre-tax loss of NKr108m (Dollars 16m) following a big reduction in
credit losses.
Fokus Bank, Norway's third-biggest commercial bank which the state acquired
last year, reports its first profit in four years. First-quarter net profit
was NKr36.7m, against a loss of NKr137.6m last year, after cutting losses on
loans and guarantees to NKr98.9m from NKr246.9m and reducing operating
expenses by NKr100.2m to NKr229.2m.
Vard, the cruise and ferry group, reports first-quarter losses, before taxes
and extraordinary items, of NKr127.3m, up from NKr44.6m last year. Vard
warned that its cruise business could be heading for an overall loss in
1993.

SEIBU, the Japanese department store group, announced yesterday that sales
had fallen below those of Mitsukoshi, its main rival, for the first time in
five years.
Seibu, which is privately owned, took the unprecedented step of publishing a
financial report. It announced it had made its first ever pre-tax
unconsolidated loss in the year to end-February. It was the first loss at
the group since its founding in 1940.
The loss was mainly due to a scandal involving medical equipment, which
forced Seibu into an extraordinary loss of Y19.7bn (Dollars 175m). It
covered the loss by selling Y35bn worth of fixed assets.
Sales were 12.3 per cent down from the previous year at Y790.1bn. Operating
profits were Y7.6bn and the pre-tax loss came to Y10.4bn.

<TEXT>
ASARCO, the integrated US copper producer, reported a first-quarter loss of
Dollars 30.9m, or 74 cents a share. A slide in metals prices and damage from
heavy rain at its biggest Arizona copper mine contributed to the loss.
The company reported a profit of Dollars 6.4m, or 16 cents, excluding
special accounting charges.
Sales were Dollars 457.1m, down from Dollars 458.9m last time.
Asarco's average realised copper price fell to 99 cents a pound in the first
three months, from Dollars 1.01 a year ago. Copper prices have continued to
slide, which would affect second-quarter results, the company said.
Lower metals prices accounted for an after-tax operating earnings decline of
Dollars 6m in the first quarter.
A scheduled 30-day maintenance shutdown of Asarco's smelter in Hayden,
Arizona, cost the company about Dollars 7m in first-quarter earnings, while
the effects of heavy rains, which continued through late February, cost the
company about Dollars 20m after tax in damage and production losses.

<TEXT>
FOMENTO Economico Mexicano (Femsa), the largest Mexican beverage and
bottling company, has agreed to sell 30 per cent of its soft-drinks division
(Femsa Refrescos) to Coca-Cola for Dollars 195m in cash.
The soft-drinks division of Femsa accounted for about Dollars 470m of the
group's overall revenue of Dollars 2.12bn last year. The purchase values
Femsa's soft drinks division at 15.8 times 1992 earnings, and two times book
value, said Mr Alfredo Livas, finance director.
The transaction is scheduled to be completed in late June or July. After
that, Femsa will offer up to 19 per cent of Femsa Refrescos' capital on
Mexican and international stock markets, obtaining a separate listing for
the soft-drinks division, probably both on the Mexican and New York stock
exchanges. The division will not assume any of Femsa's debt.
Coca-Cola has about 50 per cent of Mexico's soft drinks market, with Pepsi,
the main rival, having 21 per cent. Femsa owns, among others, the Coca-Cola
franchise in Mexico City, the largest such franchise in the world. Femsa
Refrescos will now become an anchor bottling operation for Coca-Cola in all
Latin America, and is likely to be awarded new franchises, both in and out
of Mexico, said Mr Roberto Goizueta, Coca-Cola's chief executive.
The soft-drinks division plans to invest about Dollars 500m in the next five
years in modernising plants and machinery and increasing production to meet
demand in the fast growing Mexican cola market. The expansion would be
financed by debt, the public offering, and future earnings from the company,
executives said.
Femsa took on sizeable debt about 18 months ago, when its principal
shareholders bought a 56 per cent stake in Bancomer, Mexico's second largest
bank, for Dollars 2.88bn (after interest).

losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHNEIDER, the French electrical engineering and construction group,
mustered a modest increase in net profits to FFr305m (Dollars 56.2m) in 1992
from FFr275m in 1991, in spite of continued losses at Spie-Batignolles, its
construction subsidiary.
The group, which was also affected by the cost of servicing the debt amassed
in its acquisition of Square D, the US construction company, indicated that
it anticipated another difficult year.
Schneider managed to counter the competitive economic climate by raising
capital in asset sales and through improved performances from Square D and
Merlin Gerin, its electrical distribution business. Although Spie remained
in the red, it reduced its net loss to FFr274.3m from FFr952.2m.
Group sales rose to FFr61.4bn from FFr59bn. However, Schneider swung from an
exceptional credit of FFr201m to an exceptional loss of FFr24m over the same
period, due to FFr400m of new provisions and amortisation charges.

TOYAMA Chemical, a mid-ranking Japanese pharmaceuticals company, and Mitsui
Pharmaceuticals yesterday announced they are to merge, expanding the Mitsui
group's influence in the Japanese drugs market, writes Robert Thomson in
Tokyo.
The deal involves one Y500 share in the private Mitsui Pharmaceuticals being
swapped for 10 Toyama Chemical shares of Y50 par value. The merged company,
to be formed on October 1, will be capitalised at Y18bn (Dollars 162.6m).
While the new company is supposed to be owned equally by Toyama Chemical and
Mitsui Pharmaceuticals, the merger is essentially a takeover by Mitsui group
companies.
Before October 1, Mitsui Pharmaceuticals will issue 3m new shares to
facilitate the swap.
The two companies have already made their first profit forecast, suggesting
sales in the year to end-March 1994 will be Y60.5bn, rising to Y75bn in the
following year, while pre-tax profit will rise from Y4.5bn to Y5.5bn over
the same period.

<TEXT>
CUMMINS Engine, the world's largest independent manufacturer of diesel
engines, yesterday announced a big increase in first-quarter earnings and
forecast the second quarter would be even better, writes Martin Dickson.
The figures underscore the turnround at the company, which suffered severely
when the US truck market was hit by the 1991 recession. It reported net
earnings of Dollars 41.1m, or Dollars 2.24 a share, on sales of Dollars
1.05bn, compared with earnings of Dollars 5m, or 20 cents, on sales of
Dollars 881.3m in the same period of last year, excluding accounting
changes.
The figures were better than the Dollars 2-a-share earnings forecast at the
start of this month by the company at its annual meeting.
Cummins said it expected that 'second-quarter sales and earnings will exceed
those of the first quarter, assuming economic conditions do not
deteriorate.'
It said its mid-range engine sales continued to grow as the company finished
its third quarter of shipments to Ford Motor for its medium truck range.

FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: 'Outsider' to add drive to IBM -
The new broom at Big Blue's data storage arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines is cutting its corporate apron strings and
has appointed an 'outsider' as chief executive to accelerate the
transformation of its Dollars 6.1bn data storage products operation.
The aim is to turn the division into an aggressive competitor in the booming
computer disk drive market.
Last week IBM, known in the industry as 'Big Blue', established Adstar, its
data storage products division, as a 'totally independent' subsidiary.
The company also announced the appointment of Mr Ed Zschau, founder of
Systems Industries, a Silicon Valley data storage company and a former
Republican congressman, as Adstar chairman and chief executive.
Adstar has become a testbed for IBM's strategies to return its key
businesses to profitability by blending entrepreneurial spirit and vision
with the scale, technology and manufacturing resources of its established
operations.
Mr Zschau has been charged with speeding up the transformation of Adstar
from a predominantly in-house supplier of data storage systems for IBM
mainframe computers into a leader in high-growth and emerging data storage
markets, said Mr Jack Kuehler, IBM vice-chairman.
Mr Zschau's appointment follows that of Mr Louis Gerstner, former chairman
of RJR Nabisco, who took over on April 1 as chairman and chief executive of
IBM.
The changes at Adstar were in the pipeline before Mr Gerstner's arrival, but
he 'enthusiastically endorsed' the plans, said Mr Kuehler.
Adstar, which for the past year has been an 'independent business unit',
will win even greater autonomy as a wholly-owned subsidiary, he said.
However, IBM has no plans to sell off all or part of Adstar, he said.
'Adstar is one of our most profitable entities. We want to keep it.'
In 1992, the first year for which Adstar's financial results were reported
separately, it recorded net earnings of Dollars 247m before a Dollars 512m
restructuring charge.
However, more than 90 per cent of Adstar's sales last year were
'intra-company', and its flagship products address the shrinking market for
data storage systems that work with IBM's mainframe comp-uters.
Still, Adstar remains the world's largest manufacturer of computer data
storage products, and over the past 40 years it has claimed numerous
technology breakthroughs, including the invention of the 'Winchester' disk
drive, the forerunner of today's personal computer 'hard drive'.
Yet, like IBM as a whole, Adstar faces technology trends that could
undermine its business.
Standard, low-cost disk drives used in personal computers are becoming the
building blocks for high volume data storage systems for use with mainframe
computers, replacing the proprietary systems that Adstar manufactures.
Price competition has forced Adstar to retrench. Last month, it closed its
manufacturing operations in Rochester, Minnesota, with the first compulsory
lay-offs in IBM history.
The cuts also affected three European plants, including IBM's manufacturing
operations in Havant in the UK, and one plant in South America.
All have been designated as 'industrial business centres' by IBM and have to
find new customers if they are to remain in operation.
'We have to refocus investments where the growth opportunities lie - in disk
drives for workstations and personal computers, as well as non-information
technology applications of data storage,' said Mr Kuehler.
The latter may represent Adstar's biggest opportunity. 'We forecast a market
that is five to 10 times bigger than today's Dollars 50bn data storage
market,' says Mr Ray AbuZayyad, an IBM veteran who has served as general
manager of Adstar for the past three years and who was named president of
the sub-sidiary last week.
Adstar must find ways to exploit the changes underway in the data storage
market, Mr Zschau maintains.
New applications of computing in the home and in the car - such as video
telephones, home information services, cable television 'movies on demand',
and maps and on-line traffic information for the driver - will all require
data storage products, he predicts.
Adstar will 'skate where the puck is going to be, not where it is,' adds Mr
Zschau, using an ice-hockey metaphor.
Adstar also aims to sell 'components' of data storage technology - including
semiconductor chips, software programs or other elements of data storage -
that could be licensed to other disk drive manufacturers.
IBM's competitors in the disk drive market may be more willing to buy from
IBM now that Adstar is an independent subsidiary, Mr Kuehler suggests.
For its part, Adstar will no longer have any qualms about trying to market
its products to IBM competitors in the personal computer, workstation or
other computer market segments.
'I don't know the things I'm not supposed to do, and I don't want anyone to
tell me,' says Mr Zschau. This, he suggests, is the advantage of being an
'outsider'.

USX Corporation, the US steel and energy group, yesterday reported net
income of Dollars 50m on sales of Dollars 4.28bn for the first three months
of 1993, compared with profits of Dollars 4m on sales of Dollars 4.11bn a
year earlier, excluding the effect of accounting changes.
Operating income rose to Dollars 163m in the latest quarter from Dollars
137m.
USX-US Steel, the Pittsburgh-based steel company, had net income of Dollars
13m, or 18 cents a share, in the 1993 quarter against an underlying net loss
of Dollars 20m, or 41 cents, a year earlier, excluding the effect of
accounting changes. Sales were flat at Dollars 1.2bn.
The group had operating income of Dollars 40m in the 1993 quarter against
restated operating income of Dollars 13m the previous year. In the latest
quarter, operating income benefited from a Dollars 28m gain from the use of
funds from a previously established insurance reserve to pay for some
employee insurance benefits.
Looking to the second quarter, the company expects operating income to
include a gain of Dollars 8m as these reserves are depleted.
In the latest quarter, the company had a pre-tax gain of Dollars 38m from
the disposal of assets.
USX-Marathon Group, the oil business, posted first-quarter net income of
Dollars 31m, or 10 cents, on sales of Dollars 3bn against underlying income
of Dollars 24m, or 8 cents on sales of Dollars 2.9bn a year ago, excluding
accounting changes in 1992.
Operating income for the group fell to Dollars 106m from a restated Dollars
124m last year.

BOEING, the world's biggest aircraft manufacturer, yesterday underscored the
recession in the global aerospace industry by reporting a 23 per cent drop
in first-quarter returns.
The company reported earnings of Dollars 325m, or 96 cents a share, on sales
of Dollars 6.64bn, compared with earnings of Dollars 420m, or Dollars 1.23,
on sales of Dollars 7.97bn in the same period of last year, excluding
changes in accounting practice.
The figures were broadly in line with analysts' expectations, which had
centred on earnings of around Dollars 1 a share.
The company said the drop was due mainly to lower sales of commercial
aircraft and defence and space equipment. Boeing delivered 93 commercial
aircraft during the first quarter, compared with 124 in the same period of
1992.
Commercial aircraft sales dropped from Dollars 6.54bn to Dollars 5.50bn,
while defence and space sales dipped from Dollars 1.29bn to Dollars 1.01bn.
Mr Frank Shrontz, chairman, said second-quarter sales were expected to be
somewhat higher than the first quarter, due mainly to the timing of
commercial jet deliveries, but second-half sales would be lower than the
first half, reflecting previously announced reductions in commercial
production rates.
For the full year, Boeing projected sales of some Dollars 26bn, down from
Dollars 30.2bn last year.
Boeing's annual meeting, also held yesterday, was told that the company was
studying a third version of its 777 airliner, which is currently under
development. The new version would allow a 20 per cent increase in capacity
over the two versions announced so far.
The company also confirmed it had invited aerospace groups Lockheed and
McDonnell Douglas to participate in the possible development of a new
super-jumbo jet, which it is studying with the four European partners in the
Airbus Industrie consortium. Neither company had yet replied.
Phillips Petroleum reported a first-quarter profit, compared with a loss a
year ago, higher oil and natural gas prices, Reuter reports.
Excluding special items, it had first-quarter earnings of Dollars 57m,
compared with loss of Dollars 29m a year earlier.

Bus and light commercial vehicle business improved significantly, mainly due
to demand for the Dodge Ram pick-up, which is powered by Cummins' B series
engine.
There was also a substantial increase in engine shipments to North American
heavy truck market.
Results were also helped by the company's drive to improve operating
efficiencies and reduce costs.
Sales in certain international markets, particularly the UK, remained
depressed, however.

SCHNEIDER, the French electrical engineering and construction group,
mustered a modest increase in net profits to FFr305m (Dollars 56.2m) in 1992
from FFr275m in 1991, in spite of continued losses at Spie-Batignolles, its
construction subsidiary.
The group, which was also affected by the cost of servicing the debt amassed
in its acquisition of Square D, the US construction company, indicated that
it anticipated another difficult year. It said that the past few months had
'definitely been more sluggish' than most of 1992.
Schneider last year managed to counter the competitive economic climate by
raising capital in asset sales and through improved performances from Square
D and Merlin Gerin, its electrical distribution business. Although Spie
remained in the red, it did succeed in reducing its net loss to FFr274.3m
from FFr952.2m.
Group sales rose to FFr61.4bn from FFr59bn. However, Schneider swung from an
exceptional credit of FFr201m to an exceptional loss of FFr24m over the same
period, due to FFr400m of new provisions and amortisation charges, most of
which were at Spie. Schneider compensated by making FFr220m from asset sales
and the settlement of doubtful foreign debts.
The group is continuing with asset sales in an attempt to further reduce
borrowings, following last year's 10 per cent decrease to FFr2.4bn. It
recently agreed to sell Jeumont-Schneider, its electrical components
subsidiary, to Framatome, the French nuclear reactor group. Schneider has
also transfered part of its debt into convertable bonds.
The company plans to alleviate the financial pressure on Spie-Batignolles by
buying 50 per cent of the latter's Spie-Trindel electrical installation
subsidiary. Terms of the deal have yet to be finalised.

FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Coca-Cola buys 30% stake in
Mexican bottler

<TEXT>
FOMENTO Economico Mexicano (Femsa), the largest Mexican beverage and
bottling company, has agreed to sell 30 per cent of its soft drinks division
to Coca-Cola for Dollars 195m.
Femsa owns the Coca-Cola franchise in Mexico City, the largest such
franchise in the world.
Coca-Cola's purchase ties in with its strategy of buying minority stakes in
bottling companies throughout the world as a way of increasing management
control and expanding into high-growth markets.
The soft drinks division of Femsa accounted for about 25 per cent of the
overall group's revenue of Dollars 2.12bn last year. The Coca-Cola brand has
about 50 per cent of Mexico's soft drinks market, with Pepsi, the main
rival, having 21 per cent.
Femsa is expected to separate the soft drinks division from the rest of the
company when the transaction is completed.
Mr Othon Ruiz, chief executive of Femsa, said earlier this year that the new
company would be an anchor bottling operation for all of Latin America, and
was likely to be awarded new franchises, both in and out of Mexico.
Femsa took on considerable debt about 18 months ago when its principal
shareholders bought a 56 per cent stake in Bancomer, Mexico's second-largest
bank, for Dollars 2.88bn (after interest). Since then, Femsa has sold its
mineral water division to Cadbury Schweppes for Dollars 325m. The latest
divestment will allow Femsa further to reduce debt.
Mr Carlos Laboy, an analyst with James Capel in New York, said the purchase
was 'in some respect a defensive measure against the recent consolidation of
Pepsi Cola in Mexico.' Grupo Embotellador de Mexico, the largest Pepsi
bottler outside the US, recently completed a Dollars 190m stock offering to
help finance its move into south-east Mexico.
Femsa is also looking for a partner for its beer division, with Miller of
the Philip Morris group tipped as a possible buyer. Philip Morris has a 7.9
per cent stake in Femsa.

Asarco to loss

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ASARCO, the integrated US copper producer, reported a first-quarter loss of
Dollars 30.9m, or 74 cents a share. A slide in metals prices and damage from
heavy rain at its biggest Arizona copper mine contributed to the loss.
The company reported a profit of Dollars 6.4m, or 16 cents, excluding
special accounting charges. Sales were Dollars 457.1m, down from Dollars
458.9m last time.
Asarco's average realised copper price fell to 99 cents a pound in the first
three months of the year, from Dollars 1.01 a year ago.
Lead prices dropped to 20 cents, from 25 cents; zinc prices to 47 cents,
from 53 cents; and Asarco's average realised price for gold sank to Dollars
334.86 an ounce, from Dollars 373.06.
Since the quarter's end, copper prices have continued to slide, and this
would affect second-quarter results, the company said. Lower metals prices
accounted for an after-tax operating earnings decline of Dollars 6m in the
first quarter.
A scheduled 30-day maintenance shutdown of Asarco's smelter in Hayden,
Arizona, cost the company about Dollars 7m in first-quarter earnings, while
effects of heavy rains, which continued through late February, cost about
Dollars 20m after-tax in damage and production losses.
During the quarter, Asarco opened a new copper smelter in El Paso, Texas,
which is expected to reach full capacity of 110,000 tons of copper
concentrates later this year.
Phillips Petroleum reported a first-quarter profit, compared with a loss a
year ago, higher oil and natural gas prices, Reuter reports. Excluding
special items, it had first-quarter earnings of Dollars 57m, compared with
loss of Dollars 29m a year earlier.
This year's profit included a Dollars 22m workforce reduction charge, part
of continued efforts to control costs. Last year's first-quarter loss
included a Dollars 62m charge relating to job cuts.
In the latest quarter, upstream operations recorded higher earnings, while
refining, marketing and chemicals remained under pressure.

<TEXT>
DU PONT, the leading US chemicals group, yesterday reported first-quarter
1993 net profits of Dollars 493m, or 73 cents per share, a 12 per cent
increase on the Dollars 439m, or 64 cents, of income recorded before special
charges were taken a year ago.
In the first quarter of 1992, Du Pont recorded a net loss of Dollars 4.4bn
due to non-cash accounting charges.
With these charges and one-time credits stripped out of the quarters for
both years, Du Pont's net income was 20 per cent higher in 1993.
The company's revenues of Dollars 9.07bn in the first three months of 1993
were down by Dollars 90m, or 1 per cent, due to reduced sales and selling
prices in areas of the group other than petroleum.
Mr Edgar Woolard, chairman of Du Pont, said the earnings performance was
better, notwithstanding the slow US economic recovery and very weak market
conditions in Europe.
'The improvement results from better petroleum earnings as well as from
cost-reduction and restructuring efforts that are paying off,' he explained.
The Conoco petroleum division had earnings that were 77 per cent higher in
the quarter at Dollars 200m.
This was due to higher crude oil and natural gas production outside of the
US and lower exploration costs.
The chemicals division's earnings were 17 per cent better at Dollars 69m.
Fibre earnings were down by 25 per cent at Dollars 102m. Polymer division
earnings were 10 per cent lower at Dollars 77m. The diversified businesses
unit improved earnings by 13 per cent to Dollars 107m.
Looking ahead, Mr Woolard said the extent of the improvement in the
full-year results would depend on the timing and magnitude of an economic
upturn in western Europe.
On Wall Street, Du Pont's share price was Dollars 1 1/4 higher at Dollars 53
1/8 before the close.

GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber, the last US-owned tyre group, posted
better-than-expected first-quarter earnings of Dollars 87.1m, or 60 cents a
share, against a forecast Dollars 83m to Dollars 86m.
A year earlier, underlying income was Dollars 66.1m, or 47 cents, excluding
the cumulative effect of accounting changes. Including the changes, it had a
net loss of Dollars 944.5m, or Dollars 6.67. Earnings per share have been
restated to reflect a two-for-one stock split effective May 4.
Mr Stanley Gault, chairman, said the company achieved higher operating
earnings despite 'economic confusion in the US with a new administration, a
lingering recession in Europe, and what is normally the tyre industry's
slowest sales period.'
He attributed the improvement to production efficiencies and lower selling,
administrative and general expenses as a percentage of sales. The company
also cut interest costs.
In the 1993 quarter, worldwide tyre unit sales rose 9 per cent and revenues
advanced 4.6 per cent to Dollars 2.4bn.
In the general products segment, operating income fell 18 per cent to
Dollars 43.4m on sales 15.2 lower at Dollars 411.4m,reflecting the sale of
polyester resin and industrial and commercial films operations.

interests

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOYAMA Chemical, a mid-ranking Japanese pharmaceuticals company, and Mitsui
Pharmaceuticals yesterday announced they are to merge, expanding the Mitsui
group's influence in the Japanese drugs market.
The deal involves one Y500 share in the private Mitsui Pharmaceuticals being
swapped for 10 Toyama Chemical shares of Y50 par value. The merged company,
to be formed on October 1, will be capitalised at Y18bn (Dollars 162.6m).
While the new company is supposed to be owned equally by Toyama Chemical and
Mitsui Pharmaceuticals, the merger is essentially a takeover by Mitsui group
companies.
Mitsui Toatsu, a chemicals company with an 80 per cent stake in Mitsui
Pharmaceuticals, will have a 23 per cent stake in the new company.
The deal shows the influence of keiretsu, or corporate families, in Japan.
It was arranged by Sakura Bank, the core institution of the Mitsui group,
which had a 4.9 per cent stake in Toyama, a common level of shareholding for
a main bank in Japan.
Toyama, strong in antibiotics, has struggled in an increasingly competitive
Japanese market, and reported a pre-tax loss of Y6.3bn in the year to the
end of November 1991, though it made a profit of Y3.6bn last year after a
recovery in sales.
The Japanese government is gradually lowering drug prices under a national
health insurance scheme, putting pressure on the industry to restructure.
Meanwhile, the Mitsui group has been attempting to build a pharmaceuticals
operation comparable to the large companies run by the Sumitomo and
Mitsubishi keiretsu groups.
Sales at Mitsui Pharmaceuticals last year were Y20.8bn, less than half those
of Toyama Chemical, and well below the Y422bn last year at Mitsui Toatsu,
which has a broader based business including industrial chemicals and
plastics.
Before October 1, Mitsui Pharmaceuticals will issue 3m new shares to
facilitate the swap.
The two companies have already made their first profit forecast, suggesting
sales in the year to end-March 1994 will be Y60.5bn, rising to Y75bn in the
following year, while pre-tax profit will rise from Y4.5bn to Y5.5bn over
the same period.

order books weaken

NET PROFITS at Siemens, Germany's biggest electrical and electronics group,
rose just 2 per cent to DM877m (Dollars 544.7m) in the first half of the
current year, the company said in an interim report yesterday.
Sales rose 3 per cent to DM37bn, but new orders - an important guide to
medium-term prospects - fell 4 per cent to DM41bn.
Incoming contracts from German customers, which account for just under 50
per cent of all business, fell 7 per cent, after being 4 per cent down at
the end of the first quarter.
Export orders, which were 10 per cent lower at the three-month mark, were
down 2 per cent in the six months to the end of March.
Siemens reported 'above average' orders for semiconductors and other
components, and strong business in transportation and automotive systems.
However, new contracts for the core telecommunications and power generation
divisions were lower than at the same time last year.
Most of the sales growth in the period under review was attributed to power
and transportation.
Yesterday's report made no mention of progress at Siemens-Nixdorf, SNI, the
computer subsidiary which last year lost DM513m on sales of DM13bn. However,
the company denied a report that SNI was heading for a DM1bn loss this year.
Siemens referred to a statement last month which said SNI might even show a
slight improvement, depending on economic conditions. But this seems
increasingly unlikely in the light of worsening economic conditions in
Germany and the lack of growth in overseas markets.
While the company said half-year sales matched its 'modest expectations for
the full year', it offered no further profits forecasts. Mr Heinrich von
Pierer, chief executive, said last month that it would be difficult for the
group to equal last year's DM1.96bn.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GAN, the French state-controlled insurance group which is a candidate for
privatisation under France's new conservative government, suffered a sharp
fall in net profits to FFr402m last year from FFr2.32bn (Dollars 420m) in
1991.
Mr Francois Heilbronner, chairman, said Gan's performance this year would
'depend on economic conditions'. Despite the group's poor performance, he
said its main objective in 1993 was to prepare for privatisation.
Gan, like the other big French insurers, was badly affected last year by the
intensely-competitive state of the insurance market, particularly the damage
sector. Union des Assurances de Paris and Assurances Generales de France,
the other two state-controlled insurers, have already announced steep falls
in profits for 1992.
However, Gan has been more vulnerable to the economic squeeze than its
competitors, chiefly because of its exposure to the depressed property
sector. This posed a dual problem last year because of the shortfall in
profits on asset sales and the need to make heavy provisions on its property
interests.
Insurance sales rose from FFr39.7bn to FFr43.7bn in 1992 but profits from
insurance fell from FFr1.5bn to FFr200m. Worst hit was damage insurance,
which made a loss of FFr1.1bn against a FFr501m profit, due to an increase
in claims, particularly in fraudulent ones.

FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Flaws in the Elf takeover theory
 -A strategic stake in Petrofina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PETROFINA, the Belgian oil and gas company, yesterday confirmed that Elf
Aquitaine, the French state-controlled oil company, had built up a 4.9 per
cent stake in the group.
Elf's undeclared presence on the Petrofina share register has fuelled
intense speculation about a possible bid for Belgium's largest industrial
company, which would rival the controversial struggle for control of Societe
Generale de Belgique, Belgium's largest holding company, in the late 1980s.
Petrofina's share price, which rose slightly to BFr8,790 yesterday, has come
down from its peak of BFr11,750 a year ago, making the stock a more
attractive target for predators. Shareholders are due to vote today on a
series of proposed defensive measures, one of which would have forced Elf
out into the open anyway, by obliging investors to declare stakes of more
than 3 per cent.
Meanwhile, La Generale, which controls an 11.33 per cent stake in the oil
company, is searching for ways of reducing its industrial exposure.
But in the last few days oil has been poured on these troubled waters. On
Friday, Mr Gerard Worms, chairman of Compagnie de Suez, La Generale's French
majority shareholder, said it was 'highly unlikely' the Belgian holding
company would sell its Petrofina stake. If it did, Petrofina's chairman, Mr
Albert Frere, who controls some 28 per cent of the group through Groupe
Bruxelles Lambert and other holding companies, would have first refusal.
Given Mr Frere's predilection for shuffling his holdings, this may not be as
sure a guarantee of future stability as Petrofina would like the speculators
to believe. But it is true that the typically Belgian network of agreements
between existing shareholders might deter outside predators.
A more important flaw in the Elf takeover theory is that Petrofina would not
fit into the French company's strategy. The activities of the two groups are
complementary - Elf is strong in exploration and production, while Petrofina
is more heavily committed to refining. But Elf would almost certainly have
trouble digesting Petrofina.
A more likely option is a strategic alliance between the two. Strapped for
cash and carrying debt of some BFr100bn (Dollars 3.02bn), Petrofina is
trying to cut operational costs by BFr3bn this year and raise between BFr5bn
and BFr8bn annually from asset sales - meaning strategic partnership rather
than outright disposals.
For Petrofina shareholders, such alliances could be their only consolation
over the next two years. Consolidated profits in 1992 fell by 72 per cent,
from BFr16.3bn to BFr4.6bn, as low crude prices, pressure on refining
margins, overcapacity in the petrochemicals sector and an adverse
dollar-franc exchange rate all took their toll. The dividend was halved -
the first cut since 1959. Moreover, the company is having to take swift and
expensive action to upgrade the ageing Ekofisk oil installations in the
North Sea. This year, a 7 or 8 per cent increase in oil production is
probably the best that investors have to look forward to.
The exploration budget - BFr10bn two years ago - is being cut to less than
BFr3bn this year, and some of the work is being farmed out to new partners.
Downstream, the group has reined in its US and European ambitions for a wide
network of Fina service stations, to concentrate on areas which can be
easily and cheaply supplied from existing pipelines and refineries, such as
northern France and Germany, or Texas and Louisiana.
The company's real hopes, however, are pinned on its BFr29bn investment in
the Antwerp refinery, which should allow it to add more value to its oil
products, while cutting sulphur emissions and content to levels much
stricter than required by European environmental regulations. The good news
is that the project is on schedule to come on stream at the end of 1994. The
bad news is that its benefits will not show through in the accounts until
1995.
Under the circumstances, analysts are surprised that the share price has
remained so buoyant for so long, but the speculation may continue.
Even Friday's calming statement from Suez prompted a small surge in the
share price, based on the fact that Elf would be interested in the La
Generale stake if it were sold.
For the future, there are new rumours about shadowy Elf 'allies', holding
stakes of less than 3 per cent and ready to support the French company
should it seek to parley with Mr Frere.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOULINEX, the French manufacturer of kitchen appliances, fell from a net
profit of FFr171m (Dollars 31.5m) in 1991 to a loss of FFr115m last year
because of difficult economic conditions in Europe and adverse exchange
rates.
The group, which two years ago took on heavy debts in acquiring Krups, the
German electrical goods producer, plans to seek new capital in an attempt to
return to profit 'within two or three years'.
For months Moulinex's management has been split over the recapitalisation
plan. But last month the group began negotiations with its banks after Mr
Gilbert Torelli, its deputy chief executive, raised his stake in Societe des
Fondateurs, the group's parent, from 35 to 44.9 per cent.
Moulinex, which also owns the Swan and Girmi brand names, has been under
pressure in the European electrical goods market where it faces fierce
competition from the giant multinational consumer electronics groups. Last
year, these general problems were aggravated by the slowdown in consumer
spending in its key French, German and UK markets.
Sales fell to FFr8.22bn from FFr8.36bn in 1991 But it was also hit by the
strength of the French franc after the September currency crisis, which cost
it an estimated FFr125m in lost income. Operating profits plummeted to
FFr235m from FFr499m in 1991.
Results were also hit by the restructuring of Krups, which cost FFr45m last
year. It has cut the Krups workforce by 800 since the takeover.

NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest publicly-quoted company, has more than doubled
first-quarter net profits to NKr506m (Dollars 75.5m) from NKr217m last year,
helped by lower production costs, higher crude oil output and a higher
krone/dollar exchange rate.
The result was better than analysts' forecasts as Hydro's four main business
segments outperformed expectations by boosting operating profits and sales.
The shares closed up NKr3.50 at NKr168 on the Oslo bourse yesterday.
Group sales increased by NKr807m to NKr16.47bn as operating profit rose by
NKr398m to NKr1.44bn. 'Hydro's oil and gas activities are continuing to
develop favourably, but otherwise the first quarter was characterised by the
persistent difficult market conditions and depressed prices,' said Mr Egil
Myklebust, chief executive.
Net financial expenses were cut to NKr625m from NKr868m as foreign exchange
losses fell to NKr194m from NKr470m. Hydro blamed the currency loss on a
fall in the value of forward contracts and a loss on receivables due to a
strengthening of the krone against European currencies.
The company said in the second quarter it would book a NKr2.4bn gain, before
interest income and tax, on the disposal of its 38.3 per cent shareholding
in Freia Marabou, Scandinavia's biggest chocolate producer, acquired by
Kraft General Foods International. KGFI paid NKr3.4bn for Hydro's Freia
stake.
The agriculture division lifted operating profit by NKr56m to NKr251m on
sales up NKr133m to NKr7.373bn.
Oil and gas lifted operating profit by NKr162m to NKr900m on sales up
NKr566m to NKr3.58bn.
Light metals improved operating profit by NKr201m to NKr290m on sales up
NKr159m to NKr4.3bn. Petrochemicals' profit rose by NKr16m to NKr112m on
sales up NKr48m to NKr1.1bn.

FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Societe Generale de Belgique
raise stake in Generale de Banque
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOCIETE Generale de Belgique, Belgium's largest holding company, has raised
its stake in Generale de Banque, the country's largest bank, from 21 to 26
per cent, writes Andrew Hill.
The purchase of 750,000 of the bank's shares from Fortis, the Belgian-Dutch
financial services group, is another step in La Generale's attempt to dilute
its exposure to Europe's weak industrial economy.
Fortis, which groups the activities of AG of Belgium and Amev of the
Netherlands, sold almost all its stake in Generale de Banque at the end of
last week at below market price, cutting its holding from 14.7 per cent to
1.77 per cent.
Smith New Court placed 1m shares - the largest part of the stake - with 30
international institutional investors. A further 140,000 were acquired by
Sofina, a Belgian investment holding company, which now owns a 1.5 per cent
stake.

FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Banks queue to buy Sweden's Gota
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SWEDISH government said yesterday that around 20 domestic and
international banks had shown 'serious interest' in buying Gota Bank, which
was taken over by the state in the face of mounting losses last December.
The news came as the government removed six Gota board members to signal a
clear break with the management who were in charge when the bank ran into
difficulties. The bank's chairman, Mr Dan Wersen, and managing director, Mr
Per Lundberg, both of whom only took up their positions towards the end of
last year, were the only board representatives to survive the clear-out.
The government wants to move quickly to return Gota Bank to the private
sector and believes a solution, which may involve one or more purchasers,
can be found by the end of the year. Credit Suisse First Boston is assisting
the government with the sale.
Potential purchasers are not being identified at this stage although talk
that Deutsche Bank had agreed to buy part of Gota was firmly denied by the
Swedish government and the German bank yesterday.
It is likely that any purchaser will only buy the bank's healthy assets,
which carry a value of some SKr50bn (Dollars 6.76bn). Its problem loans have
already been transferred to a separate 'bad bank' - following a model
adopted by other Swedish banks - although they are still formally under the
bank's ownership. So far the government's assistance to the bank amounts to
a SKr10bn guarantee which it provided in January.
Gota Bank is due to report first-quarter figures on Wednesday. Last year,
its operating loss deepened to SKr2.4bn from SKr1.9bn in 1991 after credit
losses more than tripled to SKr12.5bn from SKr3.7bn. The loss would have
amounted to SKr12.9bn without SKr4.5bn in financial insurance and SKr6.0bn
in state guarantees.
Five new members have already been appointed to the board, including a
representative from the finance ministry.

FT  27 APR 93 / UK Company News: Guinness silent on Red Stripe stake
speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS, the brewing and spirits group, is, according to industry sources,
negotiating to buy a majority stake in Desnoes &amp; Geddes, the Jamaican brewer
of Red Stripe lager.
Guinness declined to confirm the talks yesterday. 'We never comment on
speculation concerning possible acquisitions,' the company said.
However, Guinness has had a long and close relationship with the Jamaican
company which for many years has brewed its stout under licence. Jamaican
consumption has doubled over the last two years to make the country one of
the top 12 markets for Guinness worldwide.
Acquisition of a majority stake in the company, in which Heineken has a 14
per cent holding, would further the UK group's strategy of expanding its
international brewing operations by taking control of brewers with
substantial local market shares.
Guinness, which first began exporting to the West Indies 176 years ago,
already holds minority stakes in several of the 12 brewers which now produce
its stout under licence in other Caribbean countries.
Desnoes &amp; Geddes, which also produces a range of soft drinks, introduced its
Red Stripe lager into the UK in the late 1970s. Brewed under licence by
Charles Wells, the independent Bedford-based brewer, and marketed and
distributed by HP Bulmer, it is now the number three packaged lager in the
UK - behind Stella Artois and Beck's - with estimated annual sales of
100,000 barrels.
Charles Wells also exports the lager to several continental European
markets, including Spain and Italy.

FT  27 APR 93 / UK Company News: Wensum improves in second half but stays in
loss for year
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WENSUM, the men's wear manufacturer, showed an improvement in the second
half but that proved insufficient to offset the first half loss.
Consequently there was a pre-tax deficit for the year ended January 30 1993
of Pounds 44,000, compared with a profit of Pounds 607,000.
Following the cut to the interim dividend the final is reduced to 1.25p
(2.35p) for a total of 1.825p, against 3.5p. Losses per share came to 0.33p
(5.63p).
Both operating companies achieved a small trading profit totalling Pounds
75,000 (Pounds 747,000) but insufficient to offset an interest charge of
Pounds 119,000 (Pounds 140,000).
In manufacturing, turnover rose to Pounds 5m (Pounds 4.94m). The corporate
company saw a substantial fall to Pounds 1.57m (Pounds 2.7m) as the decline
in repeat orders continued through the year, and there was no significant
uniform launch.
The group entered into a three-year licensing agreement for a leading
Japanese company to manufacture and sell men's clothing in Japan under the
Wensum label.
Directors viewed that as 'an exciting development' with great potential for
the longer term development of the label.
On prospects they said both companies had substantially better forward order
books.
Corporate had a significant new launch and there were signs that repeat
orders were improving. The manufacturing subsidiary was well under way with
the projects for increased production and efficiency.

BOOTS, the retail and pharmaceutical group, is paying Pounds 14.5m for two
over-the-counter healthcare companies in Europe.
Boots said the acquisitions would give Boots Heathcare International, the
OTC medicines and consumer products business set up last year, critical mass
in France and Italy.
The French business being bought is La Societe Francaise du Triclocarban,
the main products of which are Nobacter, a shaving foam, and Solubacter, an
antiseptic wash. It has sales of Pounds 5.1m.
Boots will move production to its own manufacturing facility in France and
will sell the products through its existing sales force.
In Italy, Boots is buying Marco Viti, with annual sales of Pounds 4.4m and
products which fit with Boots' existing portfolio.
The purchase includes a manufacturing base near Milan and a sales team.

DIFFICULT trading conditions continued throughout the first half at S Lyles;
turnover fell 19 per cent and pre-tax profit slumped 78 per cent.
However, the interim dividend for the six months to December 31 1992 is held
at 1.55p, payable from earnings per share of 1.02p (4.47p).
Home sales of this yarn spinner and dyer dropped to Pounds 3.97m (Pounds

Pounds 102,000 (Pounds 486,000).
Mr John Lyles, chairman, said the significant fall in demand necessitated
the workforce being reduced by a further 10 per cent.
'However, if present indications of emerging confidence in the UK and US
economies are sustained, I would expect some improvement in demand later
this calendar year, although the economies of some of our European trading
partners remain a matter of concern', he said.
The decision on the final dividend would depend on the outturn for 1992-93
and prospects for the following year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AUTOMAGIC Holdings, the shoe repairing and key cutting retail chain,
returned to the black for the 28 weeks to January 9 with a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 76,000, against a loss of Pounds 436,000.
The profit was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 91,000 (Pounds
55,000) relating to losses arising from the disposal of leasehold premises.
Last year the USM-quoted company closed its dry cleaning factories, although
it has yet to dispose of the premises, and closed a number of branches, the
relevant leases being assigned during the period.
Mr Mike Strom, chairman, said the first half performance was encouraging and
although he did not necessarily expect the same contribution in the second
half, the group continued to trade profitably and he remained optimistic for
the outcome of the year as a whole.
Turnover was little changed at Pounds 6.38m (Pounds 6.47m) but operating
losses of Pounds 228,000 were replaced by profits of Pounds 273,000.
Earnings per share were 0.9p against losses of 7p.

FT  27 APR 93 / UK Company News: Wensum improves but stays in loss over year
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WENSUM, the men's wear manufacturer, showed an improvement in the second
half but that proved insufficient to offset the first half loss.
Consequently there was a pre-tax deficit for the year ended January 30 1993
of Pounds 44,000, compared with a profit of Pounds 607,000.
Following the cut to the interim dividend the final is reduced to 1.25p
(2.35p) for a total of 1.825p, against 3.5p. Losses per share came to 0.33p
(5.63p).
Both operating companies achieved a small trading profit totalling Pounds
75,000 (Pounds 747,000) but insufficient to offset an interest charge of
Pounds 119,000 (Pounds 140,000).
In manufacturing, turnover rose to Pounds 5m (Pounds 4.94m). The corporate
company saw a substantial fall to Pounds 1.57m (Pounds 2.7m) as the decline
in repeat orders continued through the year, and there was no significant
uniform launch.
The group entered into a three-year licensing agreement for a leading
Japanese company to manufacture and sell men's clothing in Japan under the
Wensum label.
Directors viewed that as 'an exciting development' with great potential for
the longer term development of the label.
On prospects they said both companies had substantially better forward order
books.
Corporate had a significant new launch and there were signs that repeat
orders were improving. The manufacturing subsidiary was well under way with
the projects for increased production and efficiency.
The first half was unlikely to reflect those developments but 'we are
optimistic that they will have a marked impact on the second half results',
the directors said.

FT  27 APR 93 / UK Company News: Jupiter Tyndall surges to Pounds 5.7m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ORGANIC growth and the success of the acquisition of the Tyndall group were
reflected in an upsurge in pre-tax profits at Jupiter Tyndall, the banking
and investment management group, in 1992.
After a net exceptional charge of Pounds 790,000, pre-tax profit for the
year was Pounds 5.7m, compared with Pounds 1.17m for the previous 10 months.
Net turnover rose to Pounds 14.4m (Pounds 5m).
The exceptional charge took account of a signing-on fee and associated costs
of Pounds 1.81m relating to Mr Leonard Licht joining the group as deputy
chairman and chief investment officer last July.
Mr John Duffield, chairman, said the Tyndall acquisition involved much work
and reorganisation throughout 1991 and into the second half of 1992. He now
regarded the company as fully integrated.
He warned that it would be impossible to maintain the past high rate of
growth 'now that we have reached our present size'. The current year would
be one of consolidation and he was not expecting a great increase in pre-tax
profits. Also a near-normal level tax charge would affect net profits and
earnings per share.
In the past year the two banks produced pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.38m, a
considerable improvement over the previous period.
The two banks were only involved in cash management. They lend customers'
deposits only to the leading banks and building societies in the interbank
market, so the possibility of a drop in deposits, if there was a prolonged
period of low interest rates, remained a concern, Mr Duffield noted.
Earnings per share were 13.6p (4.4p). The final dividend is 4.5p for a total
of 7.5p (5p).
As the majority of profits are earned overseas the group is following the
trend of offering scrip dividends in excess of the cash equivalent.
Shareholders can take a scrip of 7.2p, and James Capel, the brokers, are
underwriting the scrip shares at a value of 6.84p free of expenses to a
selling shareholder.

FT  27 APR 93 / UK Company News: Rocking the foundations - Non-property
companies are still failing to realise the implications of the fall in
property values
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE repercussions of the collapse of the commercial property market are
spreading throughout the corporate sector.
The slump has made deep inroads into the value of property owned by British
companies, which was estimated to be worth some Pounds 224bn in 1989.
There are signs, however, that companies outside the property sector have
not yet acknowledged the scale of their problems. Some analysts argue that
the likelihood of property-related shocks is now greater for non-property
companies than for quoted property companies.
'Many non-property companies with an involvement in property have yet to
face up to reality,' says Mr Marc Gilbard of NatWest Securities. 'Almost
certainly a lot of properties are overvalued.'
Companies have been slow to acknowledge the impact of the downturn on their
balance sheets in the hope that this will prove a temporary downturn,
leading to 'no permanent diminution in value'.
This attitude may prove too complacent. Unless inflation takes off, the
recovery of property values is likely to be a long, slow haul. That alone is
a reason for companies to bite the bullet on provisions.
Another, perhaps more pressing, reason why companies should take a more
realistic view of property values stems from new accounting standards. The
Accounting Standards Board, the body that sets standards, has proposed rules
that would force companies to revalue their assets every few years.
Financial Reporting Standard 3, due to come force in June, requires
companies to base profits of property disposals on book values, rather than
historic costs. That may encourage companies to get their book values
written down as quickly as they can.
The sectors most exposed to falling property values are:
The banks, which have a three-fold exposure to property: their own branch
network, their loans to property companies and their loans to companies that
are secured against properties. Many commentators believe that the
provisions already announced fall far short of what will eventually be
needed. One recent estimate suggested that the banks could face a shortfall
of some Pounds 8bn against office property in the south-east of England.
The construction companies, many of which expanded into property development
during the 1980s. Analysts expect the UK's 10 biggest construction companies
to make provisions of up to Pounds 700m for 1992. The total provisions from
the sector may top Pounds 1bn when the write-downs from small and medium
housebuilders and construction companies are included. Already, the top 20
builders have written off a total of Pounds 800m from the book value of
housing land and developments in the four years between 1989 and 1992,
according to Warburg Securities.
The brewers, which own assets with a total value of well above Pounds 10bn
in the form of breweries, pubs, off-licences, warehouses and so on. The fall
in property prices will knock huge sums off their assets. Whitbread, for
instance, would lose some Pounds 450m from reserves if its property estate
fell by 15 per cent, as was indicated by a sample revaluation of its
property assets last November.
However, analysts believe that revaluations should not have a great impact
on share prices, since brewing stocks are increasingly bought for earnings
stream rather than asset valuation. More palpable damage could arise from
the loans made by brewers to free-trade customers that are secured on
assets.
The retail companies, for which property accounts for more than 50 per cent
of their total asset base - the largest proportion of any sector.
Traditionally, asset values have been an important component in the value of
a stores group, particularly at the time of a takeover. But the main
problems concern those companies which diversified into property development
during the 1980s. Burton, the worst-affected, was forced to write off the
value of its property developments by Pounds 169m in 1990 and Pounds 155m in
1991.
Another problem, which has escalated during the recession, relates to the
rent due on former premises, if a subsequent tenant defaults. Boots made a
provision of Pounds 5.8m in its last financial year related to 'leases where
the assignees have defaulted'.
The hotels and leisure companies, the most property-rich sector of all, with
assets of more than Pounds 30bn, according to DTZ Debenham Tewson. The link
between property prices and share prices has been weakening, however.
Property transactions of the large leisure companies accounted for 26 per
cent of pre-tax profits in 1989 according to NatWest Securities. By
contrast, their contribution was minimal for most companies last year.
A comparison of the impact of falling property values on different sectors
demonstrates that a large property exposure does not necessarily damage a
company's prospects or share price. The damage inflicted by declining asset
values depends on its involvement in property trading and development, its
gearing and the size of its reserves.
The most visible sign of falling assets appears in those companies with
development or trading properties. Those often result in large write-downs
that damage the profit and loss account. In the past they have been tucked
away as extraordinary items. Under FRS 3, that is no longer an option.
Writing down fixed assets is not necessarily a pressing problem. Falls in
values are often comfortably written off directly to the revaluation
reserve, which provides a cushion built up from past unrealised surpluses.
This process is not always as straightforward as it might seem, however. The
definition of a fixed asset proved controversial in the case of Trafalgar
House, which reclassified development properties worth Pounds 102.7m as
fixed assets in 1991, thus taking the loss through reserves rather than its
profit and loss account.
The Financial Reporting Review Panel later forced a reversal of this,
resulting in the restatement of its 1991 Pounds 122.4m profit as a loss of
Pounds 38.5m.
Another problem with write-downs of fixed assets emerges when the
revaluation reserve is wiped out, forcing further deficits to be taken
through the profit and loss account. When Ladbroke made a 15 per cent
provision against its Pounds 1bn investment property portfolio, its 1992
profits collapsed from Pounds 146.3m to Pounds 5.2m.
But perhaps the most important and widespread problem concerns companies'
ability to borrow. Companies will find it more difficult to borrow as their
gearing increases. Falling asset values may cause companies to breach their
banking covenants and will make it more difficult borrow in the future.
A recent study for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors suggested
that a 10 per cent fall in property prices today would lead to at least a
Pounds 10bn fall in borrowing over the next two years.
The potential of falling property values to damage corporate profitability
and constrain corporate borrowing is gradually becoming increasingly
apparent.

FT  27 APR 93 / UK Company News: Transformation of the Triangle Trust - The
two men behind Mayflower's rapid acceleration into the fast lane
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN LESS than four years Rupert Hambro and John Simpson have transformed the
shell of Triangle Trust, the old Tri-ang toy holding company, into
Mayflower, the UK's leading automotive design and engineering group.
Barely pausing for breath in the midst of an aggressive 1-for-1 rights issue
announced a month ago to raise Pounds 34.6m, the Mayflower twosome jumped
last week to take advantage of the financial collapse of IAD (UK) to buy
Britain's leading independent automotive design house out of administrative
receivership.
Mayflower entered the automotive scene as an unknown quantity less than two
years ago with the purchase of Motor Panels out of the receivership of the
parent company CH Industrials in a deal worth Pounds 14.8m.
Now the combination of Motor Panels and International Automotive Design has
created for the first time in the UK an automotive design, engineering and
manufacturing group that has the resources to challenge some of the leading
continental European houses such as Pininfarina, Italdesign, Bertone and
Idea of Italy and Karmann of Germany.
Shaven-headed - apart from a pencil moustache - and with a taste for
colourful ties Mr Simpson, chief executive of Mayflower, has begun to cut a
distinctive figure behind the scenes of the motor industry.
With the backing of Rupert Hambro as non-executive chairman, he is well on
his way to achieving his ambition of building a Pounds 100m public company.
Mayflower currently has a market capitalisation of about Pounds 95.5m. Its
turnover of Pounds 67.8m last year, which was forecast to rise to some
Pounds 70m this year, will now advance by about Pounds 40m in a full year
through the addition of IAD.
The company has grown rapidly out of the opportunities and problems facing
Mr Simpson and Mr Hambro by the late 1980s.
Mr Hambro, who broke away from Hambros Bank with his father and two brothers
in 1986 to establish JO Hambro in corporate finance and investment
management, had a problem of what to do with Triangle Trust, a loss-making,
publicly-quoted company.
Hambro had bought into the company as an investment opportunity but had
failed to make a go of the group's operations spread across toymaking,
financial services and advertising.
Mr Simpson, aged 50, was looking for a vehicle to gain a stock market
quotation for his privately-owned mini-conglomerate Timelaw (RPHM), which by
1989 chiefly comprised Ribbons, a maker of webbing for seatbelts, parachutes
and other safety harnesses, and a direct marketing company PHM.
Prior to setting up in business on his own account, Mr Simpson's main
commercial experience had been with Bunzl, where at the age of 28 he had
been one of the company's youngest divisional managing directors responsible
for the Rolex Paper Company.
The two decided to join forces. In 1989 Triangle Trust paid Mr Simpson and
his business partners Pounds 11.2m for Timelaw - Pounds 4.5m in cash and the
rest in shares. Mr Simpson became chief executive with Rupert Hambro staying
as non-executive chairman. The company's name was changed to Mayflower.
Of their respective roles Mr Hambro says: 'I bring the City connections. I
act as a sounding board. John Simpson and David Donnelly, the finance
director, run the industrial operations and acquisitions.'
Mr Simpson was set on expanding his new company in engineering and
manufacturing. Motor Panels was the first big opportunity to arise.
Such opportunities do not come easily. By the time IAD fell into
administrative receivership three weeks ago, it was the 111th company that
Mayflower had looked at. It had previously had contacts with International
Automotive Design and Mr John Shute, its pugnacious founder and chairman,
but the price had always been too high. IAD's receivership changed the two
groups fortunes.
In 1989 the Cinvest venture capital group had bought into IAD, acquiring a
13.5 per cent interest for Pounds 4.5m which valued the group at Pounds 33m.
Mayflower has now paid Pounds 3.25m in cash to acquire the IAD business and
assets from the receiver together with the shares of IAD's overseas trading
subsidiaries, which did not go into receivership.
The combination of IAD's established design expertise and international
reputation in the world auto industry and Motor Panels' greater experience
in manufacturing could now produce a highly effective combination in the
intensely competitive world arena for automotive design, engineering and
manufacturing services.
Motor Panels, the Coventry-based automotive engineering group, already
operates in vehicle engineering design and development through to tooling
and manufacturing.
Before the IAD acquisition Mayflower was already expanding rapidly and was
in the midst of its second rights issue in less than two years with the
Pounds 34.6m it was already raising aimed at financing its existing
ambitious expansion in the UK and the US.
It raised about Pounds 17m in 1991 to buy Motor Panels.
Mayflower increased its pre-tax profit to Pounds 1.7m last year on turnover
of Pounds 67.8m and with a workforce worldwide of close to 1,000.
IAD incurred a loss of Pounds 105,000 on turnover of Pounds 62m for the year
to the end of April 1991, its last audited accounts. It also has a workforce
approaching 1,000 worldwide, including a large number of independent
consultants, with just under 300 in the UK. It suffered 'substantial losses'
of Pounds 2m to Pounds 2.5m in the last 12 months.
Based at Worthing, West Sussex, IAD has carried out contracts for many of
the world's leading vehicle makers since it was formed by Mr Shute in 1976.
It has established a presence in most of the world's leading car producing
countries with subsidiaries in Germany, France, Spain and the US and liaison
offices in Tokyo, Seoul and Moscow.
IAD has played a leading role in the design and prototype development of a
wide range of vehicles including the Ford Scorpio estate car, Ford's Lincoln
Town Car in the US, the Volvo 440, the Mazda MX-5 sports car and the
three-door Fiat Tipo as well as electric and light commercial vehicles.
The Motor Panels business in the UK and in the US has recently won, or is at
an advanced stage of negotiations on, several large contracts.
Even before the IAD takeover Mayflower had moved into the fast lane and
expected capital investment to jump from Pounds 3m in 1992 to about Pounds
23m this year, chiefly for the development of its plants and equipment in
the UK and in the US.
Its turnover more than doubled last year to Pounds 67.8m (Pounds 27.4m), and
Mr Simpson had forecast that turnover would rise to Pounds 110m-Pounds 120m
by 1995, before IAD dropped into Mayflower's lap.
Privately owned, IAD was brought down by a lack of financial resources in
recession.
Mayflower is seeking not to repeat the mistake. At the time of the rights
issue it had a Pounds 1.4m cash balance and no bank borrowings. Gearing was
expected to rise to only 26 per cent in 1994, when the Motor Panels
expansion programme was expected to be at its peak. IAD will worsen the
ratios, but according to Mr Simpson the opportunity was too good to be
missed.

FT  27 APR 93 / UK Company News: British Gas expands in electricity
generation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS has set up a new wholly owned subsidiary with initial capital of
Pounds 12m to invest in electricity cogeneration schemes worldwide.
The new division will invest in the development, construction and operation
of combined heat and power plants for customers in the UK and overseas.
Mr John Earl, managing director of Cogeneration Investments, said the
company will support British Gas's Global Gas business in its overseas
operations. 'Cogeneration provides a lot of environmental benefits and can
be at the end of many fuel chains,' he said.
Cogeneration involves the production of electricity and recycling the waste
gases to provide heating or cooling for other industrial processes.
Cogeneration Investments signed its first contract, worth about Pounds 15m,
to provide the energy requirements for SCM Chemicals Europe - one of the
world's leading titanium dioxide makers - for the next 15 years. As part of
the deal, the company will build a 15MW CHP plant at SCM's south Humberside
site.
The plant is expected to operate at over 80 per cent efficiency compared
with 30 per cent from conventional power stations, and greatly reduce carbon
dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions.
Mr Earl said the company expected to sign another deal this year and was
involved in discussions on two further contracts.

FT  27 APR 93 / UK Company News: Rise of 74% suits Moss Bros
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COLOURFUL jackets from Versace, retailing at about Pounds 300 each, helped
Moss Bros, the men's wear company, lift pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.3m for
the 53 weeks to January 30.
That was an improvement of 74 per cent on the Pounds 1.32m returned for the
previous 52 weeks.
More than a third of profits came from net interest receivable of Pounds
933,000 (Pounds 720,000). The company ended the year with a Pounds 14m cash
balance and said it was considering both organic growth and expansion by
acquisition.
After a tax credit of Pounds 1.05m in the previous year, Moss Bros paid
Pounds 877,000 tax. Earnings per share were 8.52p (5.19p before the tax
credit).
Directors propose a final dividend of 4p, giving a total for the year of
5.5p (5p).
The company, which sells more than one in every 20 suits bought, increased
turnover 8 per cent to Pounds 55.8m mainly due to an increase in
like-for-like sales of 5.5 per cent.
This figure masked a 14 per cent increase in the contribution from Cecil
Gee, the high street outlet for fashion products, including the jackets,
although the company said a range of racy briefs, also from Versace, had
sold less well.
Suit Co, the mainstream retailer, recorded a 3.5 per cent increase in sales
while classic outfitter Savoy Taylors Guild improved sales 3.5 per cent.
Turnover was also lifted by the inclusion for the first time of the Dormie
business acquired at the end of 1991 and the additional week covered by the
1992 accounting period.
Mr Rowland Gee, group managing director, said: 'Business failures in
clothing retail companies went up by 67 per cent last year which means
Britain is no longer over-shopped.
'We think we will be one of the sectors to come out of the recession
quickest.'

FT  27 APR 93 / UK Company News: European purchases for Boots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOTS, the retail and pharmaceutical group, is paying Pounds 14.5m for two
over-the-counter healthcare companies in Europe.
Boots said the acquisitions would give Boots Heathcare International, the
OTC medicines and consumer products business set up last year, critical mass
in France and Italy.
The French business being bought is La Societe Francaise du Triclocarban,
the main products of which are Nobacter, a shaving foam, and Solubacter, an
antiseptic wash. It has sales of Pounds 5.1m.
Boots will move production to its own manufacturing facility in France and
will sell the products through its existing sales force.
In Italy, Boots is buying Marco Viti, with annual sales of Pounds 4.4m and
products which fit with Boots' existing portfolio. The purchase includes a
manufacturing base near Milan and a sales team.
Boots' strategy is to develop its brands across Europe, based on four
product areas: analgesics, such as its Nurofen brand already sold in France
and Italy; eyecare, such as its Optrex brand; skincare, including brands
like E45; and cough and cold treatments such as Strepsils, which is the
leading OTC sore throat remedy in France.

<TEXT>
FARNELL Electronics, the components and equipment manufacturer and
distributor, reported a 12.5 per cent increase in operating profits
reflecting organic growth and a maiden full-year contribution from ESD
Distribution.
Pre-tax profits in the year to January 31 increased 27 per cent to Pounds
41.6m (Pounds 32.7m) after the sale of a non-trading subsidiary which
generated a Pounds 6.36m exceptional profit. Profits were also boosted by
interest income of Pounds 1.03m compared to costs of Pounds 468,000 last
time.
Earnings per share, adjusted to exclude the exceptional item and prior
years' tax credit, edged ahead to 17.2p (16.5p). A final dividend of 3.4p is
recommended, making a total up 7 per cent to 6.2p (5.8p).
Operating profits increased to Pounds 36.3m (Pounds 32.2m) on turnover ahead
24 per cent to Pounds 254.3m (Pounds 204.9m). ESD, which was acquired from
STC for Pounds 61m in July 1991, contributed turnover of Pounds 95.8m
(Pounds 55.9m) and an operating profit of Pounds 9m (Pounds 5m).
However, Mr Richard Hanwell, chairman, emphasised that organic growth,
including the expansion into continental Europe, was responsible for more
than a quarter of the turnover increase.
The core distribution division lifted operating profit to Pounds 36.2m
(Pounds 30.5m) on turnover of Pounds 208.8m (Pounds 159.6m).
The smaller manufacturing division has been restructured and split into
three businesses: power supplies, components and instruments. It reported a
reduced Pounds 1.04m (Pounds 2.52m) operating profit on turnover of Pounds
50.5m (Pounds 49.3m).
Commenting on the outlook Mr Hanwell said group trading in the first quarter
was 10 per cent higher than the comparable 1992 period on a like-for-like
basis and said prospects were 'promising.'
Farnell's strong cash flow enabled it to reduce debt by Pounds 14m and cut
gearing from 17 per cent to nil while continuing to invest. During 1992 the
group spent Pounds 9m on capital expenditure, including the completion of a
new computerised warehousing centre in Leeds. In addition, having expanded
into Germany in 1989, two more continental European operations were opened
last year in the Netherlands and France.
COMMENT
The results were as expected but nevertheless serve to underline that ESD
was a shrewd acquisition. However, Farnell's proven ability to achieve
organic growth despite recession should not be overlooked. The expansion
into continental Europe should help fuel growth with the German operations
expected to break-even this year. The additional good news is that after a
nine-month interregnum a new but as-yet unnamed chief executive has been
chosen. The improving economic backdrop in the UK should help the group lift
pre-tax profits to about Pounds 40m this year, equivalent to earnings of
19.8p. The shares gained 9p to 387p and are trading on a deserved
prospective p/e of 19.5.

FT  27 APR 93 / UK Company News: Plateau's Pounds 1.5m asset disposal angers
suitor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLATEAU MINING, which is resisting a Pounds 1.2m hostile bid, has agreed to
sell an asset to Delta Gold, an Australian group, for about Pounds 1.5m.
Guinness Mahon, Plateau's adviser, said the price was equivalent to 3.45p
for each Plateau share compared with 3p at which they were suspended in
August.
The bid is from Kingstream Resources, a small Australian exploration
company. Mr Michael Bradbrook of Ionian Corporate Finance, Kingstream's
adviser, said: 'It is unbelievable that an asset assigned a nil value in
March when the Plateau accounts were signed off now has such a huge value.'
He said Kingstream had no intention of giving up and was now reconsidering
the terms of its offer to take account of the Delta deal.
Plateau, formerly a natural resources group but now a shell, is to sell the
net smelter royalty interest it holds in the Mhondoro platinum-nickel-copper
project in Zimbabwe jointly owned by Delta, the Anglo American Corporation
of South Africa and RTZ.
Delta will allot a minimum of 1.85m shares. Australian stock exchange rules
do not permit the shares to be sold for 12 months and, depending on the
length of the escrow period, Delta will issue up to 200,000 more shares as
an additional consideration to take account of the delay.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Net asset value at Lowland Investment Company increased from 201.2p to
252.3p over the 12 months to March 31. At September 30 1992 it stood at
200.8p.
Net revenue for the six months to the end of March was lower at Pounds
899,000, compared with Pounds 983,000. Earnings per share came out at 3.82p
(4.19p), but the interim dividend is raised from 3p to 3.2p.
Directors said the final should be at least maintained at 5.5p.

FT  27 APR 93 / UK Company News: BTR reveals higher earnings bands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SALARY of Mr Alan Jackson, chief executive of BTR, is not revealed in
the industrial conglomerate's annual report because his duties are
considered by the company to be discharged mainly outside the UK.
In fact, Mr Jackson earned between Pounds 460,001-Pounds 465,000 last year -
not the figure of Pounds 272,590 reported in the Financial Times last week.
The lower figure was that of BTR's highest paid UK-based director, which an
adviser to the company wrongly identified as being the chief executive.
BTR has now revealed the higher earnings bands of three directors which were
not published in the annual report - Mr Jackson, a director who earned
Pounds 365,001-Pounds 380,000, and another who earned Pounds 410,001-Pounds
415,000.
Mr Graeme Pearson, who joined BTR's main board on November 25, earned Pounds
20,001-Pounds 25,000 for his work to December 31.
Mr Jackson's salary increased by 5 per cent last year, a period which saw
group profits increase 18 per cent to more than Pounds 1bn. His salary is
not regarded in the City as excessive, given the company's performance.
Mr Stanley Williams, BTR's company secretary, said: 'We are proud of the
basis on which our executives are rewarded.'
BTR declined to comment on whether Mr Jackson, an Australian, was resident
in the UK for tax purposes. Under Inland Revenue rules, anyone who spends
183 days or more in the UK per annum is resident - whether or not the person
is a UK citizen.
Mr Williams said the salaries of these executives had not been in the annual
report because of the terms of the 1985 Companies Act, which requires only
the salary of the chairman and UK executives be published.
The act also states that this information 'need not be given in respect of a
director who discharged his duties as such wholly or mainly outside the UK.'
Analysts and institutional investors in BTR were surprised to learn that Mr
Jackson came into this category, although more than 60 per cent of BTR's
sales and profits come from outside the UK.
Mr Jackson, 57, moved to the UK in 1991 when he became group chief
executive, after having been managing director of BTR Nylex, the UK group's
Australian subsidiary.
He is still chairman of BTR Nylex and in 1991 was appointed a director of
the Australian Reserve Bank.
BTR's reputation for restraint was burnished when Sir Owen Green, the
group's retiring chairman, received a pay increase of just Pounds 804 to
Pounds 217,616 - a rise of 0.37 per cent. One analyst said: 'You can
understand why the Companies Act was drawn up in the way it was, but there's
really no reason why we should not know the salaries of all directors of UK
companies.'

FT  27 APR 93 / Gerstner pledges to revive IBM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAMPA, FLORIDA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR LOUIS Gerstner, IBM's new chairman and chief executive, yesterday pledged
to restore the world's largest computer company to profit. 'We can bring IBM
back,' he told the company's annual meeting in Florida.
'I'm determined to restore not only the value of your shares, but also your
confidence in the company,' he told shareholders in his first public
statement since taking over at IBM on April 1.
He faces the challenge of winning over shareholders angry at the performance
of IBM shares, which have lost half their value over the past year. Much of
that anger was directed at the board of directors 'on whose watch' IBM's
problems emerged.
As a signal of their unhappiness with the board, 28 per cent of all IBM
shareholders voted to eliminate retirement benefits for non-employee
directors.
Although Mr Gerstner appeared to make a favourable impression upon
shareholders, several raised questions about his remuneration. His salary is
almost double that of his predecessor Mr John Akers. In addition to a
Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.2m) salary, Mr Gerstner received a one-off payment of
Dollars 5m on joining IBM and generous share options.
He acknowledged that employee morale was low in many parts of IBM, and vowed
to try to complete the 'downsizing' of the company as quickly as possible.
'I don't have a plan that I can describe to you today,' Mr Gerstner said,
stressing he has had little time to assess IBM's problems.
Mr Gerstner outlined his priorities: first to 'right-size' the company
through job reductions. 'Secondly, we will sharply define our strategic
priorities, pin down what businesses we'll pursue, which deserve priority
and what competitive platforms we'll build on,' he said. 'Third, we will
organise the company around that strategy, achieving the benefits of
decentralisation while seizing the advantage of our size. Fourth, we will
redouble our commitment to our customers.'
IBM's share price has plunged over the past year from more than Dollars 100
last summer, to around Dollars 50 in recent weeks. Last year IBM cut its
dividend by 55 per cent to 54 cents per quarter.
Yesterday IBM's board voted to maintain the quarterly dividend at this
level, dispelling fears of another dividend cut.

FT  27 APR 93 / SmithKline Beecham announces succession
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHKLINE Beecham, the Anglo-American drugs and consumer products group,
yesterday announced that Mr Henry Wendt, chairman, and Mr Robert Bauman,
chief executive, will retire next April.
Sir Peter Walters, chairman of Midland Bank and a non-executive director of
SB since 1989, will then become non-executive chairman.
Mr Jan Leschly, head of SB's pharmaceuticals since 1990 when he moved to the
company from the US group Squibb, will take over as chief executive. SB's
share price yesterday closed down 3p at 446p.
The appointment of Mr Leschly, a 51-year old Danish pharmacist, cuts through
the problem of whether to appoint a former employee of SmithKline Beckman or
Beecham.
The appointment of Sir Peter, 61, will calm concerns that the company is
becoming too American. He is expected to surrender his chairman's position
at Midland over the next 12 months. He will continue to be a non-executive
director of HSBC Holdings.
The surprise announcement, made at SB's annual general meeting, is, the
company says, part of a carefully planned transition to ensure the group
maintains continuity and focus.
The approach is in marked contrast to recent events at Glaxo, the UK
pharmaceuticals group, where Sir Paul Girolami, chairman, sacked his chief
executive Mr Ernest Mario.
Dr Jean-Pierre Garnier, president of the north American pharmaceuticals
operations has been appointed executive vice-president of pharmaceuticals.

FT  27 APR 93 / Rowland reluctant to sell the Observer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Tiny Rowland has told colleagues he does not want to sell the Observer,
the newspaper he has controlled since 1981.
Mr Rowland, joint chief executive with Mr Dieter Bock of Lonrho, the
international conglomerate, still believes the paper is worth far more to
the group in terms of influence than the Pounds 8m to Pounds 9m it is
expected to lose this year.
Last year it lost Pounds 14.9m. Mr Bock, Lonrho's biggest shareholder with
18.8 per cent, has decided to sell the Observer title and is believed to
have the support of a number of other directors who are more interested in
reducing costs than owning a lossmaking national newspaper.
Mr Rowland's relectance to sell the newspaper, despite bids from Newspaper
Publishing, publishers of rival The Independent and its Sunday stablemate,
and The Guardian, could mark the first trial of strength between the two
chief executives.
One of Lonrho's financial advisers yesterday said Mr Bock is as determined
as ever to dispose of the Observer.
Mr Paul Spicer, Lonrho's deputy chairman, declined to comment.
The group's shares yesterday rose 4p to 88 1/2 p on a day the market fell.
A financier close to Lonrho said: 'The City is clearly pleased that Mr Bock
is already making his presence felt by reducing the group's debt and
tackling a loss-making operation.'
No formal decision has been taken by the Observer board to sell.
But if its parent decides to dispose of the title, then the arguments will
centre on finding a solution that will protect the existence of Britain's
oldest Sunday newspaper.
A sale to Newspaper Publishing might be called a merger but would in effect
end the Observer's 201 years as a separate title.
In a Commons statement on Lonrho's purchase of the Observer in 1981, Mr John
Biffen, then trade secretary, said Lonrho should consult the Observer board
if it proposed to dispose of the paper at a future date.
The Observer board meets on May 4, when the issue of the paper's future will
be on the agenda.

FT  27 APR 93 / Boots reveals death risk of heart drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Boots Company, the UK retailer and pharmaceuticals group, yesterday
revealed that Manoplax, its heart drug, can lead to significantly higher
mortality.
The revelation is a severe blow for the company's pharmaceuticals division,
whose executives have described the medicine as one of the last hopes for
the drugs operation.
Mr Terry Richardson, international and marketing director said last year:
'We are betting heavily on Manoplax. It is a very important drug capable of
reshaping the whole business.' Manoplax was predicted as potentially
eventually generating sales of between Pounds 100m and Pounds 300m a year.
Boots said sales of the drug, launched in the UK last September and in the
US this March, had been far above expectations.
The company said preliminary results from a clinical trial involving 3,500
patients in the US, Canada and Sweden, had suggested that patients with
severe congestive heart failure taking 100mg of Manoplax a day had a
'significantly increased risk of death compared with those not receiving the
drug'.
Boots would not say how large the increase in mortality had been, nor would
it state when the results of the trial, called the Profile study, would be
published. It said the full analysis of the data, which might show if the
increased mortality had been among a sub-set of patients, would be known in
two to three weeks.
'We have had a very difficult couple of days with the US and British
regulatory authorities which have different views about the significance of
the trial,' said Mr Alastair Eperon, director of corporate affairs at Boots.
The company said the data did not suggest there was an increased risk of
death at a dose of 75mg. It said the company had every confidence in the
future prospects of Manoplax.
Boots has been forced to write to all US, Canadian, Scandinavian and British
physicians who might prescribe the drug, warning them not to use the 100mg
dose.
Manoplax has been dogged by controversy.
Delays before it was licensed were so long that the medicine was dubbed by
analysts 'Mananaplax'.

BRITISH AIRWAYS will exercise its option on Dollars 86.3m (Pounds 54m) worth
of USAir stock to maintain its current 24.6 per cent equity stake in the
sixth largest US carrier.
The UK flag carrier is also in advanced negotiations with the Danish AP
Moller group over the future of their joint interest in Brymon European
Airways, the UK regional carrier formed last year by the amalgamation of
Brymon Airways and Birmingham European Airways.
BA's decision to exercise its rights to buy additional USAir stock follows
the US carrier's plan to sell 10m new shares to investors to raise about
Dollars 260m to improve its debt-laden balance sheet.
The move will increase BA's financial investment in USAir to Dollars 386.3m.
The UK carrier acquired its minority stake in USAir last January for Dollars
300m. Under its investment agreement with USAir, BA also gained certain
rights to buy shares of preferred stock convertible into USAir common shares
to maintain its underlying interest if the US carrier proceeded with a new
equity issue.
BA's decision to subscribe to the new issue confirms the UK flag carrier's
commitment to the partnership with USAir, which it regards as an integral
part of its strategy to become a global airline.
BA said yesterday the USAir convertible preference share stock it was
subscribing to were convertible into 3.27m common shares at Dollars 26.40 a
share.
BA also said it would subscribe a further Dollars 12.9m should underwriters
to USAir's offering exercise options to take an additional 15 per cent above
the offering.
While consolidating its partnerships in the international market, BA is also
continuing to reorganise and rationalise its domestic operations.
The latest rationalisation is expected to involve the loss-making Brymon
European Airways, the regional carrier owned by The Plimsoll Line in which
BA has a 40 per cent stake.
The AP Moller group, through its Maersk Air subsidiary, also owns 40 per
cent of The Plimsoll Line with the remaining 20 per cent held by Jim Harris
Holdings. Mr Harris is a former BA marketing director and a former chairman
of the London Ambulance Brigade.

FT  27 APR 93 / IMF warns UK of tax rise or cut in spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITAIN will have to increase taxes or cut spending to curb its growing
government deficit, possibly as early as this year, the International
Monetary Fund warns in its latest World Economic Outlook, published
yesterday.
The fund also suggests that Britain might have trouble in meeting its
inflation target next year.
The IMF's message is the starkest warning since the recent signs of a return
to growth in the UK economy that the recovery might be blown off course by
either a continuation of large fiscal deficits or rapidly rising prices.
The IMF has also slashed its growth projection for the European Community
this year to 0.1 per cent. In its last outlook, published in October, the
IMF said EC growth would be 2.3 per cent in 1993.
The report says the sustainability of the UK recovery 'will depend on the
(UK) authorities' ability to safeguard the credibility of their
anti-inflationary commitment, especially in the light of the potentially
inflationary consequences of sterling's decline (since leaving the European
exchange rate mechanism)'.
The recovery 'in turn depends critically on the adoption of further
measures, in the 1994 budget or even before, to secure a faster reduction of
the large budget deficit'.
Any further cuts in UK interest rates 'should be resisted', the report
continues, unless there is good reason to believe inflation is under
control.
However, UK economic prospects for 1993 have 'improved', with the likelihood
that recovery will be 'firmly established' by next year. Gross domestic
product is thought likely to expand by 1.4 per cent this year, and by 3.1
per cent next year.
The gap between government spending and income is put at 6.2 per cent of
gross domestic product last year, rising to a likely 8.8 per cent this year
and falling slightly to 7.7 per cent in 1994. The deficit will still be 3.8
per cent of GDP in 1998 on current policies, the IMF calculates.
The IMF reckons the retail prices index, minus mortgage costs, will rise by
3.9 per cent this year, against 4.7 per cent last year, and rise to 4 per
cent in 1994.

FT  27 APR 93 / Scalfaro asks banker to be PM: Political outsider promises
electoral reform and fiscal austerity in Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR CARLO Azeglio Ciampi, the veteran governor of the Bank of Italy who has
never held political office, accepted a challenge from Italy's president
yesterday to form the country's 52nd post-war government. His appointment
comes against the background of a deepening corruption scandal.
Mr Ciampi, aged 72, promised to carry out the radical electoral reform
endorsed by Italy's voters this month. He pledged that he would also
continue with fiscal austerity, defend the lira and regain the lost momentum
of privatisation.
The surprise move represents the personal choice of President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro, who has used his constitutional powers to the limit. It is the
first time that a non-parliamentarian has been asked to head a government, a
fact that underlines the deadlock among the main parties over a replacement
to Mr Giuliano Amato, whose four-party coalition government resigned last
Thursday.
Mr Ciampi is understood to have had reservations about accepting the task
and has demanded freedom from the normal tutelage of the party leaders in
choosing his cabinet.
He hopes to be able to announce his team today. It will then have to be
endorsed by parliament - a process that cannot be taken for granted.
Temporarily Mr Ciampi's position in the Bank of Italy will not be filled.
Earlier this year he indicated his desire to retire, but the political
parties have been squabbling over who should succeed him.
His government will have the limited aim of introducing a new set of
electoral laws as soon as possible and will then hold early elections.
The financial markets reacted positively to the news, with the lira
strengthening from L941 against the D-Mark to L933 by the end of the day. In
his acceptance speech, Mr Ciampi made a point of promising to continue to
reduce the public-sector deficit.
The president has gambled on Mr Ciampi's professional prestige to be able to
pick a government that can achieve a broad consensus in parliament. Last
night, though, political commentators pointed out that electoral reform -
the central task after last week's referendum - would be extremely difficult
to steer through parliament.
The choice of Mr Ciampi was greeted with caution last night by the main
opposition party, the Party of the Democratic Left, and by the principal new
political grouping, the Lombard League. The Socialists, one of the two
dominant partners in the outgoing coalition, also made clear that Mr Ciampi
was not their first choice.

FT  27 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Gold
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
These days, one need only breathe the name George Soros to quicken the
investment pulse. Sir James Goldsmith still excites some in the same way and
when the two are linked, passions in saloon bars may swell beyond endurance.
Add the intellectual endorsement of modern-day Jeremiahs such as Lord
Rees-Mogg and a stampede cannot be far off. However tempting it may be to
deflate such hype as a little canny buying and a lot of talk, there may be
something more stirring in the gold market.
For US investors, returns on cash are as near to zero as makes no odds. Bond
yields may be around a cyclical low point and equities remain expensive by
most historical measures. Those worried by the recent weakness in the dollar
may well be tempted by a little gold - especially with the opportunity cost
of holding bullion low. The balance of supply and demand has also been
slowly shifting in recent years. Jewellery fabrication and bar hoarding now
soak up more metal than new mined supply and scrap provide. Forward sales by
producers, using borrowed central bank bullion, have locked many into
current low prices for some of their production. If they wish to unwind
these, sales producers will have to buy in the open market because they
cannot produce sufficient from their own mines or stocks. Russia has
probably sold most of the gold fitments which can be easily unscrewed.
Against that is the threat of central bank selling and a subdued inflation
trend. But the banks may hold off once a run starts, and the gold price has
hinted of inflation to come before now.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After sterling's devaluation and the four percentage point cut in interest
rates since September, it would be deeply worrying if there were no sign of
economic recovery. From that perspective, the 0.6 per cent first-quarter
rise in non-oil GDP was the least that might have been expected. It leaves
the chancellor's Budget forecast of 1.25 per cent for the full year looking
conservative. City consensus expectations may move up a further notch to
settle above 1.5 per cent, but even that is not much to write home about.
More important is whether this is a recovery capable of sustained momentum.
Today's CBI trends survey will provide some indication of what
follow-through to expect in the second quarter. Doubts remain for the longer
term. The debt problems that underlay the recession are not over: negative
equity and the stock of repossessed property will restrain recovery in the
housing market. Sterling is strengthening again just as exporters need
additional competitiveness to confront the downturn in their European
markets. Next year's large tax increases may undermine confidence,
especially as the perception grows that interest rates have hit their
trough.
All that fits with an anaemic US-style recovery. The difference is the two
successive monthly falls in unemployment. These could be signalling a much
stronger recovery than previously expected. It is more likely, however, that
patterns of behaviour in the labour market have changed in ways that make it
respond more quickly to shifts in economic sentiment.

FT  27 APR 93 / The Lex Column: United Biscuits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 11 per cent rise in United Biscuits' share price in the past two trading
days shows how excited the market is becoming about a possible break-up bid.
UB's supposed vulnerability lies in the weakness of Ross Young's and
Keebler, which account for half UB's assets but generate poor returns. UB
has long argued it would not be wise to sell at fire-sale prices. Besides,
it finally appears to be making progress in rationalising both companies.
But thanks to the wonders of acquisition accounting, a bidder could take
short cuts, enduring greater rationalisation pain than UB could stomach.
This would leave the acquirer with UB's two attractive core businesses.
McVitie's biscuits could be run for cash, KP snacks for growth.
The trouble with this scenario is the timing and context. Any lurking asset
strippers would have struck seven months ago when Keebler's problems
undermined the shares. A bidder must also know a hostile approach would
surely send UB scurrying into the arms of a white knight.
UB will hardly moan if the bid premium remains in the price. It may even be
able to catch up with the rating on pure trading grounds if the recovery at
Keebler proves as fast as some suspect. The launch of a cigarette price war
by Philip Morris will squeeze RJR Nabisco hard. There could be some
relaxation of Nabisco's aggression in the biscuits market which so
embarrassed Keebler.

FT  27 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Compound growth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The smooth management transition at SmithKline Beecham stands in marked
contrast to the sudden departure of Mr Ernest Mario from Glaxo last month.
The relaxed reaction of the shares yesterday shows which approach the market
prefers. The marriage of SmithKline Beckman and Beecham in 1989 must also be
judged a success for ending years of underperformance for shareholders in
both companies. There have been disappointments along the way. The cosmetics
business might have been sold for more. Yet the balance sheet has been
restored to good order, as promised. More importantly, the combined business
looks diverse enough to ride out nasty shocks.
The merger might still provide a model in this respect. One might wonder
whether Boots' drugs business is broad-based enough to bounce back should
Manoplax, its heart drug, flop following yesterday's poor clinical trials
data. Fisons' future as an independent pharmaceuticals company is open to
question for similar reasons. SmithKline Beecham must still deal with the US
patent expiry of Tagamet, it biggest selling drug, but US sales of Tagamet
now account for only a small percentage of turnover.
Cheap generic versions of Tagamet may be more of a threat to Glaxo, which
depends on its rival anti-ulcer treatment Zantac for almost half of sales.
Whether Glaxo can overcome its dependence on Zantac alone, or needs an
outside partner to bring diversity, remains the burning question. Those with
long memories will remember blood-letting among the top management at
SmithKline Beckman before it settled on the merger solution.

FT  27 APR 93 / Willis likely to be succeeded by deputy as head of TUC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Willis, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, yesterday
announced he would take early retirement after the TUC's annual congress in
September.
Mr Willis, aged 60, has held his post for nine years. Although tributes to
his past work came from both inside and outside the union movement
yesterday, there has been criticism over the years of his leadership style
and, in particular, his lack of impact as a public speaker.
The next TUC general secretary is likely to be Mr John Monks, aged 47, the
current deputy general secretary. Nominations from affiliated unions for the
post will be open until mid-July and an election at this year's congress in
Brighton will follow if more than one candidate stands.
Mr Willis said he had considered retiring last year but had postponed the
decision because of the TUC's campaign to save miners' jobs.
One factor which may have persuaded him to announce his retirement at this
point was the recent vote by members of the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union to affiliate to the TUC. The vote came five years after
members of the EETPU electricians' union, now a section of the AEEU, was
expelled from the TUC for breaking its rules over poaching members from
other unions.
Mr Willis said he had been 'greatly encouraged' by the vote which had paved
the way for the organised unity the TUC needed. 'However, given that other
serious problems and challenges may persist, I believe that the new thrust
of trade union drive and leadership can best be sustained by electing a new
general secretary now to carry out those responsibilities for some years
ahead,' he said.
Mr Alan Tuffin, TUC president, said Mr Willis had 'led the TUC through a
period when the trade union movement has come under unprecedented and
sustained attack'. Under his leadership the TUC had 'still found positive
ways of moving forward', Mr Tuffin added.
Mr Neil Kinnock, former Labour leader, said: 'In destructive times Norman
Willis has never stopped being constructive. Norman's sense of justice and
his sense of humour have both been irrepressible.'
Mr Geoff Armstrong, director general of the Institute of Personnel
Management, said Mr Willis's unfailing good humour probably did much to hold
the movement together and avoid disaster.
Trade union membership has fallen by more than 25 per cent to 7.7m since Mr
Willis first took office, creating severe financial problems for the TUC -
both staffing levels at headquarters and activities have been reduced.

FT  27 APR 93 / Plan for private sector to take over running of 20 pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE SECTOR companies are to be given the opportunity to run 20 pits
under plans for the first stage of privatisation of the coal industry.
British Coal has added two pits which had been mothballed for several years
to the 18 which the government said in its coal white paper last month would
be offered to independent operators.
It also emerged yesterday that under proposals being finalised this week,
British Coal intends to offer the pits on a one-by-one basis, rather than
wait for the conclusion of consultations with unions on all 20.
This raises the possibility that British Coal will advertise for bids in
about a month and could result in some pits reopening under private sector
control in the autumn or early winter.
The sale or licensing of the pits - either is a possibility - will be the
prelude to full privatisation of the industry, including the 31 remaining
pits. British Coal executives expect a privatisation bill to be tabled in
the autumn with royal assent likely in the middle of next year.
British Coal also plans to offer for sale in the late summer its Coal
Products subsidiary, which makes and sells smokeless fuel, and Compower, a
data-processing business dealing with pay systems.
A management buy-out team will be among the likely bidders for Coal
Products, which has a turnover of Pounds 150m a year.
Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, said yesterday that he also hoped a
new home could be found for the Coal Research Establishment, a research
agency, possibly under another government organisation.
British Coal expects to complete later this week the initial legal
documentation for the potential sale or leasing the 20 pits.
The pits which have now been added to the list are Frances, Fife, which has
been mothballed since 1984 when it produced 350,000 tonnes a year, and
Keresley, Warwickshire, which closed in 1991 when production was 1.2m
tonnes.
These are added to 12 pits earmarked for closure and six for care and
maintenance.
British Coal has rejected requests from potential bidders, including the
Union of Democratic Mineworkers, that it continues to mine the pits pending
lease negotiations.
Mr Ray Proctor, executive in charge of the leasing or sale arrangements,
also said yesterday that British Coal would take some machinery from the
pits. 'We have to be conscious of the needs of the continuing collieries,'
he said.
Any mines licensed will be added to the 94 which already operate in the
private sector. Their output, at 1.1m tonnes a year, is small compared to
British Coal's, and they employ an average of 12 people.
The new generation of licensed mines will be able to employ up to 150 people
under legislation which is unlikely to be changed before full privatisation.

FT  27 APR 93 / Personal View: No way to run a health service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC CAINES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is accepted by most outsiders and even acknowledged by a few honest
insiders that Whitehall's greatest skill is in stopping things happening -
not in the sense of bringing things to a halt but preventing them from being
as good as they might have been.
Nowhere is this illustrated more strikingly than in the development of the
National Health Service since Kenneth Clarke, then the health secretary,
introduced his reform package in April 1991. It released a wave of
expectation and energy among progressive general managers of the service and
even caught the imagination of some doctors and nurses. But the sad truth is
that disillusionment has now set in.
The reforms introduced the idea of survival through performance. A market
would be created in which the purchasers were separated from the providers
of healthcare. Hospitals providing an effective service would thrive and
would attract more business; those which performed less well would be at
risk.
Purchasing power was to be the order of the day, but this was to be balanced
by giving local management wide-ranging freedoms from central control. This
left management's survival in the new market to be determined by its own
efforts. No longer were managers to be strangled in a web of central
bureaucracy. So much for the theory. In practice, matters are turning out
very differently.
To take the health market first. There are deep divisions at political and
senior management levels about how the market should be allowed to develop.
Some believe in encouraging a free market which should be regulated only
when it seems that the provision of essential services to particular
communities might be squeezed out by competitive pressures. Others believe
that the market should be managed in a way which ensures that the
consequences of market pressures are almost entirely avoided by, for
example, the retention of large contingency funds for use wherever providers
run into difficulties. This 'back pocket' approach, which is the one being
pursued at present, undermines the belief that providers in the new NHS have
to stand on their own feet.
If the health market is simply adrift, the approach to making the best use
of staff is in disarray.
The reforms offered an opportunity to break free of the centralised pay and
personnel dictates imposed by the review bodies and Whitley councils. This
could have happened by the trusts themselves taking the initiative, or they
could have been made to take it by the central abolition of the pay bodies.
Neither has happened. Trusts have not, with a very few exceptions, created
new employment packages for their staffs and ministers have not been
prepared to withstand the fuss which the unions and staff associations would
undoubtedly have made if the pay bodies had been disbanded by central
diktat. The NHS should not now complain if it finds its freedom of manoeuvre
over pay and personnel matters to be increasingly limited over the next few
years.
In one area of staffing, however, unstoppable forces have been released. In
simple terms, managers are beginning to insist that staff concentrate on
what they are trained to do. They are increasingly reluctant to pay staff to
do work which others could do just as well and at less cost. This is called
skill-mixing - redressing the balance between professionally qualified and
support staff in favour of the latter. Some bolder spirits are even
beginning to encourage staff to acquire additional skills. This will lead to
fewer multi-skilled staff doing the work which more people with narrower
skills do at present.
The tragedy is that these moves are being frowned upon by ministers because
of the anxieties they are creating among the professions, with whom
ministers do not wish to quarrel.
I fear for the NHS reforms. In their first year, which coincided with the
run-up to the general election, the NHS was shamelessly used as a political
football. No risks were allowed either with the operation of the market or
the exercise of new flexibilities. Managers, eager to prove themselves, were
never able to do so. Central authority was strictly upheld. At the end of
the second year, however, the same dreary pattern continues with managerial
flexibility still being sacrificed to political expediency.
Health ministers are not dismantling the central bureaucracy in the way the
supporters of the reforms were promised. At the same time they appear to be
doing their utmost to squeeze out of the system examples of local
initiatives which seem best designed to produce increased efficiency. This
is no way to run a railway.

As the referendum returns are announced across Russia, it is clear that
President Boris Yeltsin has carved out some space for action - but no more
than that.
To win a vote of trust and of support for his economic and social programme
from a turnout of more than 60 per cent is not bad in any democratic state.
Yeltsin's opponents, such as General Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president,
who argued yesterday that the president's policies were 'based on a
minority', are prisoners of a prevalent Soviet attitude which sees anything
less than formal unanimity as a defeat.
Was the victory fairly won? Not by western standards. The television and
radio were overwhelmingly biased towards the president and his camp. Though
opponents were heard, it was via 'sound bites' on news programmes. Yeltsin,
benefiting from the covert advice of Saatchi and Saatchi and Gallup, was
presented as both strong and lovable, a Russian muzhik who was also a
statesman.
In his confidential report on how Yeltsin was perceived, Mr Gordon Heald,
Gallup's managing director, wrote that 'time and again, (people) stressed
his muzhestvennost, or his manly qualities. . . . He was seen to be strong,
brave, frank, straightforward and, most important, resolute. . . . We
believe this should be very much emphasised in the campaign . . .' It was.
The most popular poster had the slogan: 'A strong president for a strong
Russia'. On the TV talk shows, it was Yeltsin's people who tended to be
over-represented, Yeltsin's tours and speeches which were highlighted.
The reason is not just that the top management of the two national channels,
Central and Russian TV, are political appointees of the president. It is
also that most producers and news presenters are liberal - like those in the
media everywhere usually are - and have not yet developed an objective
style. Many see the problem clearly enough, but regard their duty as
confirming democratic and market change through Yeltsin's leadership rather
than as upholding abstract standards of fairness. Thus when Mr Nikolai
Pavlov, a leader of the nationalist-communist National Salvation Front, said
yesterday that 'the subservient mass media will start a hysterical cry about
massive support for the president', he had part of a point.
Nobody, however, is going to pursue that with much vigour. The question now
is: what is to be done? In this area, the initiative is very much Yeltsin's.
He has been clear about what he intends to do. He usually is. He was clear
on March 20 that he intended to introduce presidential rule; it was instead
bartered away within the Congress of People's Deputies for Sunday's
referendum. Some observers believe Yeltsin's proclivity for compromise will
again reassert itself. However, most - and this seems to include most
Russians - expect his courage to assert itself, and for him to push through
some hard decisions.
In his eve-of-referendum speech, Yeltsin said his first priority would be to
usher in a new constitution, the main principles of which have already been
published. It comprises a 'strong' presidential republic in which the
president is both head of state and chief executive, with the rights of
appointment and dismissal of all key officials - only some of which would
need parliamentary approval. The parliament itself would be changed from the
present Soviet structure of Congress and Supreme Soviet to a bicameral body,
with an upper Council of the Federation elected from the republics and
regions, and a lower State Duma of Deputies elected on an equal territorial
basis across Russia.
Yeltsin must get this through the existing Congress - and cannot. He must
therefore find some way - either by decree, and/or by agreeing it with the
heads of the republics and regions - of putting the constitution in place
while observing (as he said in his pre-poll speech) the 'principles of
constitutionality', if not the details of the constitution itself. This is
the key battleground. His opponents have the advantage of being able to lean
on the constitution to stop him. He has the drawback of having to act
unlawfully.
To get the support of the regional and republican leaders for the
constitutional and economic changes he proposes, Yeltsin must give them
something - probably in the form of a new federal treaty which would allow
the regions to enjoy a different relationship with the centre. In effect,
each one would make a separate treaty with the central government, producing
more of a confederation than a federation. This would probably lead to
endless trouble in the future, but it is likely to be the price he must pay.
Finally, he has said he will act decisively on the economy, proposing
decrees on limiting credit, on providing a legal basis for private property
and on 'safeguarding Russia's interests' in relations with the other former
Soviet republics in the Commonwealth of Independent States. All of this will
provoke the opposition of parliament, which he must override if he is to
prevail. It is this action which will determine whether Russia can at last
capitalise on the reforms of the past 15 months by constructing the skeleton
of a financial, monetary and fiscal system robust enough to allow the
development of a real private sector, and convincing enough to allow the
west to shell out the billions it has promised.
A broad economic strategy is ready - though the government is now less
united than it was last year, and the reformers more boxed in by the
so-called 'industrialists', such as Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime
minister. The plan would bring real pain in some areas, especially for the
enterprises, which have escaped relatively lightly until now, but it carries
the possibility of making 1993 the year in which reform was consolidated.
The battle against inflation is at the core of the strategy. Inflation has
eased to about 15 per cent a month, but it is far from under control. It
continues to wipe out savings, deprive enterprises of the ability to plan,
keep foreign investment at bay and render the dollar a more attractive store
of value than the rouble. To this end, the growth in central bank credits -
seen as the basic engine of inflation - will be scaled back to 30 per cent
in the current quarter, and to 15 per cent in the next two, from a high of
about 70 per cent in the past year.
This would mean figures which will hurt those, including the government,
which have been anaesthetised to the financial crisis by cheap credits. The
advances made by the central bank to cover the budget deficit will be cut to
about Rb1,300bn this quarter, and cut further in the next two. Credits to
the former Soviet states - some almost completely dependent on them - will
be pulled back to about Rb200bn this quarter, and to Rb150bn each in the
next two. Enterprises, including agriculture, will get a total of Rb1,500bn
this quarter, less in the next two.
These figures spell, respectively, harsh cuts in government spending; the
possible collapse of state budgets in the neighbouring republics; and
bankruptcies and unemployment in industries. It would be very difficult to
retain political and social stability if they are implemented; but it would
be very difficult to control inflation and benefit from international
assistance if they are not.
In this scenario, foreign assistance on the Dollars 44bn scale proposed by
leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations in Tokyo earlier this month
is essential. It would fund enterprises, the privatisation process and above
all social security and unemployment benefit with dollars. Since the dollars
would be used by the government to buy existing roubles, there would be no
inflationary effect. Thus the strategy depends crucially on G7 commitment
and approval - bringing the west into the reform process in a more committed
and interventionist way than before.
This is a challenging programme indeed. It is another big chapter in the
Russian revolution which rattles on. Yeltsin did not run an impressive
campaign, yet the active majority of his fellow countrymen and women felt
that they could trust him and that they wanted him to carry on with his
reforms. They did not feel the need to see other candidates for the
presidency, but they do want a different parliament. This does not give
Yeltsin the legal right to press ahead, but it gives him a popular base, for
a time.

FT  27 APR 93 / Leading Article: Bosnia - no easy options
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OUTRAGE provoked by atrocities against the Moslem population of Bosnia
has brought worldwide calls for international military intervention.
Democratic governments must take account of public opinion, but they must
also avoid letting moral outrage outweigh their judgment of what is in the
national and international interest. It remains the case that the west has
no solution to this Balkan conflagration.
The easy part is to define a moral position. It is not acceptable that one
legally established state should seize the territory of another, although
there are grey areas in the complexities of post-Yugoslavian politics. It is
absolutely unacceptable that people be driven from their homes or massacred
by a state in pursuit of such expansion. For the west to have stood aside,
as some advocated, would have morally diminished it, while running the
incalculable political risk of apparently sanctioning such behaviour
elsewhere.
Perhaps there was a moment, early in the conflict, when western military
action would have made a decisive difference, but few were prepared to argue
so at the time; President Bush and Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali both thought it
was a problem for the EC to deal with. The EC made many mistakes.
Single strategy
Essentially, though, the west has pursued a single strategy: to intervene in
a humanitarian way and to apply pressure through negotiations. The aid
measures have been hesitant, but cumulative. Their success has been greater
than many forecast. Negotiations, most recently for the Vance-Owen plan,
have been frustrating and sometimes subverted by differences among the
western allies which have simultaneously generated hope of intervention
among the Moslems and confidence among Serbs and Croats that nothing
effective would emerge from the UN.
Against this background, the international community has clung to its
objectives: to lay the foundations for a permanent settlement and to
maintain the unity of the western alliance and the post-cold war consensus
within the UN. It is not clear how the military options under consideration
will support these objectives.
All governments have ruled out the massive despatch of ground troops, for
the good reason that this could lead to a Vietnam-type involvement,
eventually intolerable to public opinion. A selective lifting of the UN arms
embargo for the Moslems appeals to those who want to do more without
becoming directly involved. Such a step would, however, prolong the conflict
and could well require the suspension of the aid effort, as fighting
intensified. The UN's position would then be untenable, weakening its
influence in the Balkans and beyond. The third option - selective air
strikes - also has serious flaws, given the mountain terrain, where arms can
easily be concealed. Sooner or later, today's frustrations would be resumed,
unless air raids were followed by the use of ground troops.
Safe havens
With the Vance-Owen peace plan in ruins, where does that leave the
international community? A tougher regime of international sanctions, which
takes effect today, does not feel like a sufficient response, yet the west
would do well to learn from its mistakes. The most persistent of these has
been its own lack of unity, something which the Clinton administration needs
to bear powerfully in mind as it prepares to launch its policy initiative.
Military gestures designed to improve the rating of American and European
politicians with their domestic electorates should be avoided.
Instead, the west should continue to build upon the two strands of action
which have proved sustainable and, at least to a degree, effective. Economic
sanctions should be intensified, and extended to Croatia, which has been
shown again in recent days to be complicit in redrawing the map of the
region by force. UN forces should meanwhile continue to focus upon
channeling essential supplies, while their political masters urgently define
a wider policy of safe havens behind lines which UN forces may well have to
defend. Western airmen and soldiers may yet join this Balkan war. They
should not do so until the political aims of their so doing have been
defined.

Wakie wakie. The discovery that an experiment in etching photos and
signatures on some of its cheque guarantee cards reduced fraud by nearly 99
per cent sets the Royal Bank of Scotland wondering how long it will take the
English to catch on.
An early security measure in which the Scots captured the lead was the 1777
introduction of multicoloured bank-notes, followed, in 1835, by the
innovative step of printing two-sided notes. It was not until 1928 that the
Bank of England decided to introduce both measures, the Royal Bank points
out modestly.

The British Tourist Authority would seem to have scored an own goal. In a
campaign aimed specifically at enticing Germans to the UK, it has put its
boot right in it. Its latest ad in the Britain is Great series running in
Stern magazine is couched entirely in footballing metaphor.
'Their week in England started with a goal way offside,' it says of the
lucky German tourists. 'For him football and holidays had one thing in
common: England. This was the motherland of football . . .'
As the ad is co-sponsored by seven ferry companies there also has to be
mention of the 'very special kick' the couple got out of their crossing.
On the last day a Mr Aston invites the couple to his villa (sigh) in
Beverley for 'Yorkshire pudding' and their trip to England ends with
'exciting extra time'. The BTA could not be hinting at the exciting extra
time experienced by some other Germans when they lost the World Cup a mere
27 years ago, could it?

Call it chutzpah if you will, but the zeal displayed by South Africa's rugby
officials can only befit a recent convert. They have decided that the
Springboks won't play against the Maoris on their next New Zealand tour
because the team is selected on a racial basis.
This is all a bit rich. In 1967 an All Black tour to South Africa was
cancelled when the South African government refused to allow Maoris to be
included in the touring team. Only after the late Danie Craven took up
cudgels did the government relent and allow Maoris to tour with the All
Blacks three years later.
When South Africa toured New Zealand in 1981, opposition to the tour divided
opinion in the country. Opposition to apartheid also led to the cancellation
of the planned 1985 All Blacks tour to South Africa.
But now Nic Labuschagne, chairman of the tours committee of the
newly-integrated South African Rugby Football Union, says: 'We are very
sincere about the integration of our sport. We would not want to be a part
of anything that smacks of discrimination.'

Red faces - if not red lights - at Manchester Airport's new Terminal Two.
Electronic traffic lights failed to change from amber to red on Saturday and
a Qantas jumbo overshot its space, inflicting minimal damage but
inconveniencing about 800 passengers. Flights to Australia about to take off
from Heathrow were delayed while the Mancunians caught up.
Manchester's pride in its Pounds 265m showplace seems to be the greatest
casualty, especially as the 600 metres-long terminal is supposed to be the
most up-to-date. For the time being, aircraft are being waved in by the
decidedly less than state-of-the-art, but all too familiar, table-tennis
bats.

The fate of the consortium bank might aptly be linked to that of the oofus
oofus bird, fabled of course for flying in ever decreasing circles - and
then disappearing.
Fashionable 20 years ago, the idea of banks of assorted nationalities
getting together to do international business they were unable to do
separately collapsed as soon as the shareholders found themselves competing
with the consortia they part-owned.
The latest to come to the end of the line is Intermex. Its main shareholder,
Banco Nacional de Mexico, has just said it wants to take over the bank
entirely. It is increasing its stake from 51 per cent to almost 75 per cent,
and has begun talks to win Bank of England approval to buy out completely
the remaining shareholders, Bank of America and the Mexican state-owned
institutions Nafinsa and Bancomext.
Banamex wants to bring under its wing some Intermex businesses, in
particular its Latin American asset trading operation, and is returning to
London Rafael Mancera, nephew of the president of the Mexican central bank,
who will become head of Banamex's European operations and managing director
of Intermex.
Unsurprisingly, the changes are not to the liking of Gerard LeGrain, the
longstanding managing director of Intermex who, having guided the
institution through the debt-distressed 1980s, has now flown the nest.

FT  27 APR 93 / Leading Article: Moving on at the TUC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE resignation of Mr Norman Willis as general secretary of the Trades Union
Congress offers an opportunity for renewal in the UK's trade union movement.
Mr Willis's likely successor is Mr John Monks, a younger, sharper man who is
more capable of thinking strategically about the future of the TUC. However,
it will take more than a change at the top if Britain's trade union centre
is to re-establish itself as an important organisation in national life.
The most important challenge for the new general secretary will be to
restore the fortunes of the TUC after a period of steep decline. From 12m
affiliated members in 1979, the TUC now has around 7.7m members today. More
than members, it has lost its place in the corridors of power, no longer
wielding great authority as an estate of the realm.
Yet like the unemployed person who daily leaves home for work that no longer
exists, the TUC still behaves as if it remained a power in the land.
Staffing levels have only recently been cut below 1979 levels. The annual
seaside conference continues to instruct the nation on every aspect of
policy from vibration white finger to international relations. Congress
House generates endless paper for a myriad of committees which attempt to
shadow Whitehall.
Further weakening
Until the mid-1980s, it might just have been possible for the TUC to revert
to its previous role - had a government prepared to return to the
corporatism of the 1970s been elected. No such government materialised. And
all the while, the growth of a few large super-unions has undermined the
need for a trade union centre which acts as the general command of labour.
Unions such as the mighty TGWU general union, the AEEU craft union and the
newly-formed Unison public-sector union are capable of providing their own
research, negotiation and support services. They have little need for a TUC
which soaks up Pounds 1 a year for every affiliated member.
A further weakening of the centre's role will come when the new trade union
bill reaches the statute book. The TUC will no longer be able to operate the
Bridlington Agreement, which stops its affiliates from competing for
members. For many smaller unions, affiliation to the TUC was partly
justified by the protection it gave against poaching. Without Bridlington,
competition for members may further fracture union unity.
The challenge for the TUC is to find a new niche, in which it offers
indispensable services which no individual union can hope to provide. This
includes the collection of data from its members, in much the same way that
the CBI, the employers' body, has become a unique source of figures on
business confidence. The growing importance of European Community law in the
workplace makes the recent opening of the TUC's Brussels office overdue.
Coherent strategy
The TUC should also be the think-tank which throws out new ideas on the
issues facing people at work and outside the labour market. It is hard to
think of much that Congress House has contributed to the debate over labour
market reform to cut unemployment, for example, that stands comparison with
the effusion of ideas which has flowed from the tiny Employment Institute
with a fraction of the TUC's resources. Nor has the TUC found it possible to
open a dialogue with employers on the possible trade-off between pay rises
and extra jobs, an issue on which rank and file trade unionists in places
such as Sheffield have taken bold initiatives.
At the heart of TUC's difficulties, however, is the absence of a coherent
strategy for the union movement in a post-collective bargaining era. There
is certainly a role for unions in such circumstances, as is seen in the
success of those unions which provide high-quality services to individual
members. And unions are uniquely well-placed to voice the concerns of people
at work in national discussions on workplace matters such as health and
safety, employment law and pensions. If the TUC did not exist, a government
might have to create a surrogate to represent such interests in the future.
The challenge for Mr Willis's successor is to encourage the TUC to fill
these needs, and to sweep away the delusions of grandeur based on its past.

FT  27 APR 93 / Major reaches dry land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The agenda for Thursday's cabinet meeting is tame. It contains proposals for
new laws that might be introduced in the 1993-94 parliament. We can consider
some of these in a moment. First, note that the very nature of the
forthcoming deliberations must be a relief to the prime minister. A mundane
list of familiar ideas for new legislation is what he needs right now. It
speaks of continuity, business as usual - better yet plain, ordinary,
in-charge, day-to-day government.
Combine it with last week's defeat of the Maastricht rebels, this week's
announcement of the end of the recession, and a smart new line in
speechwriting and you have the makings of a possible reconstruction of Mr
John Major. I have always assumed that Humpty Dumpty can be put together
again, although the cracks will show forever.
The regluing could be interrupted. Fate might reassert itself. Issues of
immediate urgency could arise. It is, however, possible to anticipate some
of these and see how they might quickly be disposed of. An announcement by
President Clinton of US policy in Bosnia? Easy. It was decided last week
that Washington's lead will be followed by the British government. Salt and
pepper has already been ground over the foreign secretary's past words, the
better to prepare them for when they may have to be eaten. In any case, this
is a government that feasts on its own pronouncements.
Further news of the proposed boycott of tests by the teachers? Routine.
There is no solution. Parents want simple pencil-and-paper tests. Teachers
want complicated tests that they can control. The government just wants
tests. It cannot please parents without alienating teachers, and vice-versa.
It cannot cave in. It will therefore pretend that the tests go ahead, while
in fact they do not. Then tests become next year's problem.
Some of this week's lesser decisions will affect later ones. To take a
single example, the lottery bill, which returns to the Commons tomorrow,
provides for a wide range of outlets to sell tickets. This includes small
shops, notably those that act as Post Office sub-branches. The latter depend
on the revenue from both postal business and the handling of social security
payments. They will need to earn money as agents for the lottery if they are
to survive the eventual (but currently postponed) privatisation of the post.
The government has not yet decided whether pubs will be permitted to sell
lottery tickets; if they are, the village Post Office/shop will face what
could be killer competition. This might happen at around the time voters are
lying to pollsters again by telling them that they rather like the Labour
party. This is not a picayune question. Tory constituencies may be at stake.
It will be seen from all the above that Mr Major is lightening up. The long
torture that began with the evaporation of his authority on Black Wednesday
may have come to an end. The life or death of his political career no longer
hangs upon every move he makes. The prime minister can begin to exert
himself at what he does best - normal administration, with a little forward
planning thrown in. The long term is no longer next week; the medium term
further ahead than tomorrow morning. Meetings on the outlook for the
forthcoming year or so have been held with most of his senior colleagues,
and a package for this autumn's parliament is being prepared.
The first draft should be discussed at Thursday's cabinet. It is regarded as
particularly important, since 1993-94 is the session in which most of the
heavy stuff must be ploughed through if it is to be in place and working
well before the next election. So far I have taken it that that will come in
1996, four years after the last one. Nothing anyone connected with the
government has said to me suggests otherwise. But Mr Major's majority is
only 21. A few Tory by-election losses, plus a resurgence of inflation in
late 1994, could make a 1995 election seem suddenly attractive. The fact
that the opposition is working to a 1996 timetable would add to the
attraction of 1995. Mr Major may not have thought of this yet. He will.
Meanwhile he must consider Thursday's agenda. Two broad themes govern the
list of probable legislation: law and order, and deregulation/privatisation.
A third will create itself if the review of long-term public spending
produces any ideas that the government can nerve itself to implement. Thus
Mr Kenneth Clarke will get his police reorganisation, and Lord Mackay his
new controls over magistrates' courts. The Criminal Justice Act, the subject
of a skilful rubbishing campaign by both the higher and the lower reaches of
the judiciary, will be amended. This will be ever so slightly embarrassing,
since the ink on the existing legislation is not yet quite dry. Better a few
blushes now than red faces on polling day as juvenile persistent offenders
get away free and Labour wins points as the party of law and order.
The privatisation/deregulation programme contains well-known items:
railways, coal, London buses, municipal airports if they do not beat the
government to it by privatising themselves; a bundle of regulations
originating in Brussels that Mr Michael Heseltine sniffs out as unnecessary;
licensing laws (particularly affecting public bars); and Sunday trading. The
latter will probably be presented to the House as a list of options upon
which members will be given a free vote.
The key question asked about each one of these proposals is: will it get
through? Outlines of bills disappear into the chief whip's office for
'soundings' and stay there longer than was necessary when the government had
a dependable, and excessively large, majority. This may be one reason why Mr
Major seems to be funking the equalisation of the pensions age at 65 and why
we have to see him cut long-term public spending before we believe that he
will do it.
In short, there is no call to re-evaluate this administration as excellent,
or even good, just because it has climbed out of a swamp and looks less like
sliding back in than it did a few months ago. Its fortunes may have changed
for the better, but its quality remains the same. It is persistent,
workaday, a convincing extension of the civil service in general and the
Treasury in particular. It contains many bits of glass, and a few pearls,
but no string to draw them together. It is the government we deserve.

FT  27 APR 93 / All change, or fall down: The new TUC boss faces twin tasks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Norman Willis, who yesterday announced his early retirement as
general-secretary of the Trades Union Congress, has been called many things
during his nine years at the top of British trade unionism; 'a hard act to
follow' is not one of them.
But for Mr John Monks, Mr Willis's little-known deputy and likely successor,
the benefit of favourable comparison with his often ineffectual predecessor
will provide only temporary relief in the uphill struggles ahead.
He has two main tasks: to redefine the role of the TUC in relation to
government and to its affiliated unions, and to convince an increasingly
sceptical world that unions are still of benefit to their members and to the
economy as a whole.
Since 1984, when Mr Willis took the helm, union membership in the UK has
fallen by more than 25 per cent to 7.7m. The authority of the TUC has been
diminished both by hostile Conservative governments and the rise of
'super-unions' formed, or to be formed, by mergers between the big craft,
general and public-service unions.
Mr Monks, an unassuming but able 47-year-old Mancunian, is aware that Mr
Willis is not to blame for those unfavourable trends and that he is likely
to remain a manager of a declining industrial force. But there are few
officials, either in the TUC or in outside unions, who doubt that he will do
a better job than Mr Willis.
Although Mr Willis can be fluent and witty in private he seems plodding and
sometimes confusing on television and radio. Critics charge that coming from
the ranks of the Britain's biggest blue-collar union, the TGWU general
union, he failed to modernise the movement's cloth-cap image.
However, Mr Willis has been head of the TUC during one of its most difficult
periods, and at times, during the 1984-85 miners strike, for example, he has
shown considerable courage. But he has failed to rethink the role of the TUC
and his internal management style has been widely criticised as inept.
Mr Monks, on the other hand, is widely praised as an excellent manager both
within the TUC and in the handling of disputes between unions. The former
student of economic history at Nottingham University also better represents
both the new 'classless' meritocracy within the unions, and the new,
predominantly white-collar, trade union members, most of whom now have at
least one A level.
'He has a good feel for how the average Lancashire textile worker thinks,
but is also a moderniser who knows how the unions need to reposition
themselves,' says one senior trade union official. He certainly understands
the value that the trade union movement places on loyalty and has been
properly applauded over the past few years for abstaining from the
whispering campaign by some union leaders against Mr Willis, great though
the temptation might have been.
Mr Monks will have to prove that he can deliver the sharper focus for the
TUC that has been much talked about since the Labour party's election defeat
last year but little acted upon. The TUC must become a service centre for
its affiliates, concentrating on key areas where it can best add value:
Europe, health and safety, labour law, pensions and education. It must also
become a more effective lobbyist of government, rather than the labour
movement's civil service, producing documents on all public policy issues
which are usually ignored.
Mr Monks believes strongly in this new role. One colleague who has attended
meetings between Mr Monks and Conservative MPs, as part of the TUC's
new-style lobbying on the current employment bill, says: 'He is a good
performer in meetings with Tory MPs. He's got credibility and a certain
establishment feel about him, and he's got no hang-ups about doing it.'
But while he might be able to deliver on internal reforms, especially as
there is now a wide consensus in favour, it is less clear that he can
succeed in the broader role of selling the unions. Mr Monks is an
uncharismatic TUC bureaucrat who sometimes appears rather worn down by his
six years as deputy. He can seem cautious about new ideas, such as enlisting
the unions in the attempt to reach a better trade-off between pay and jobs,
for example, or pushing harder in the direction of positive rights for all
employees rather than just union members.
He is also unlikely to become a great media performer, which is why some TUC
insiders believe his deputy should be a more appealing and fluent outsider
such as Mr Jack Dromey, of the TGWU, or Ms Brenda Dean, the former print
union leader, instead of Mr Brendan Barber, the in-house candidate.
With or without such an aide the best hope for the TUC is that Mr Monks can
grow in the job. He is certainly a thoughtful and open man with none of the
strutting rhetoric sometimes associated with union bosses. He believes
strongly in Europe - he has a Dutch wife, Francine - and is politically
pragmatic, urging his colleagues to show more flexibility and substance when
arguing the union case.
In the age of the super-union it may, in any case, be more appropriate to
have a thoughtful manager at the head of the TUC rather than an
authoritarian leader trying to stamp his authority on everyone. As Mr Monks
himself points out, the conglomerate unions are here to stay, mirroring the
development of British industry.
The unions have had little to celebrate in recent years, and even failed to
turn popular discontent over pit closures to their advantage. The employment
bill before parliament will hit them hard, especially the proposal to make
it more difficult for unions to have dues automatically deducted by
employers. In his typically pragmatic vein, Mr Monks likes to point out that
ending automatic 'check-off' will hit employers too, because they usually
hold the money for unions on deposit for a few weeks before handing it over.
Despite the battering the unions have taken Mr Monks also likes to point to
the fact that more than 50 per cent of the workforce is still covered by
collective bargaining and that almost all of Britain's top exporters, such
as ICI and British Aerospace, are highly unionised companies.
Unions, he believes, should signify efficiency, productivity and
profitability as well as decent treatment of employees. He will make that
point to government and employers more eloquently than his predecessor.
Whether he can halt the long-term slide in TUC influence must remain in
doubt.

FT  27 APR 93 / Letter: Japan must face up to its Gatt obligations on
low-alcohol tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RONALD BROWN and Mr TIM JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We refer to Mr Kojiro Shiojiri's letter 'No contravention of Gatt rules
by Japan's low-alcohol tax' (April 20), which does less than justice to the
position held by the European Commission and the industry.
The EC disappointment with the new tax structure is two-fold. First, as Mr
Shiojiri says, EC regulation 1576/89 prohibits European whisky distillers
from producing and selling whisky less than 40 degrees proof. The new tax is
thus discriminatory in its effect on European producers, including the
French who cannot produce and sell whiskies below this strength - one recent
attempt to circumvent the legislation, to which Mr Shiojiri is possibly
referring, failed last year in a Paris court.
Second, European producers feel the Japanese government has not taken
advantage of an opportunity for implementation of full liquor tax
harmonisation as provided for in the 1987 Gatt council ruling. The latter
was accepted by Japan and partially implemented in 1989, and full compliance
was again formally requested last year by the Commission. The key finding
was that Shochu (accounting for about 65 per cent of Japan's distilled
spirits market) is competitive with all distilled liquor (including whisky,
brandy and vodka), and should be taxed similarly so as not to afford
protection to domestic production.
It appears that, in printing, Mr Shiojiri's figures have become confused:
Shochu Koh is taxed at Y83.1 per litre and Shochu Otsu at Y48 per litre
(each on the basis of 20 degrees alcoholic strength). This compares with
Y978.29 per litre for 40 per cent proof whisky and brandy, and Y331.4 per
litre for all spirits such as vodka and gin. Even allowing for the
differences in alcoholic strength, the ratios are therefore between 5:1 and
10:1 for Shochu and whisky/brandy, and slightly less for other spirits.
It is also worth noting that duty levels on whisky entering Japan are six
times those of whisky entering the UK, and 10 times those of whisky entering
the US.
The recent new tax on diluted whisky seems a partial admission of the need
for a more level playing field. But, by leaving European distillers in the
cold, it raises yet again the question of why Japan continues to protect the
ailing domestic spirits industry at a time when its trade surplus continues
to soar.
Michiyo Nakamoto's article (April 21) illustrates the EC's pessimism on this
point, and in particular the Commission's unhappiness with Japan's
discriminatory liquor taxes. It seems the appropriate time for the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs and the Japanese government to face up to their
international Gatt obligations.

FT  27 APR 93 / Letter: Mayor of St Petersburg a 'tireless' campaigner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Commenting on the mood of St Petersburg citizens ('Referendum fails to
inspire St Petersburg', April 24) and the reputation of the city leadership,
your reporter commented that, on the eve of the referendum, Mayor Anatoly
Sobchak was 'enjoying himself in London at the annual meeting of the EBRD'.
We hope that Mr Sobchak enjoyed his hectic day and a half in London. But I
can say that, in almost six hours which Mr Sobchak spent in our company (in
private sessions with more than 40 international business and other
leaders), he was tireless in putting the case for helping his city and
engaging in partnership projects. These included youth enterprise and
training, building rehabilitation and assisting the city's unique yet
impoverished cultural institutions.
Those who met him were left in no doubt as to his boldness and commitment in
leading St Petersburg through the unprecedented social and economic
challenges it faces.

FT  27 APR 93 / Letter: Think ahead on terrorism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr COLIN APPLEBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Within a year we have seen bombings in London, Manchester, Warrington
and, now, lightning has struck twice in the City of London.
Just like last time, the atrocity has caught a number of concerns with their
organisational pants down. The various disaster recovery and business
continuity services should be well known by now, yet a great many companies
are still failing to prepare adequate contingency plans. Businesses must
learn that disasters do happen and that terrorism represents only the most
visible of risks.
I suspect that, even with the latest tragedy still filling our television
screens, there are still companies prepared to risk their corporate
existence, rather than invest a fraction of turnover in business continuity
planning.

FT  27 APR 93 / Letter: Nigerian debt proposal too optimistic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IVAN NUTBROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Paul Adams and Michael Holman's suggestion (April 23) that Nigeria
could receive debt relief of 60 per cent on its debts through a Trinidad
terms deal is more than a little optimistic for two reasons.
First, because Trinidad deals only cover government-to-government debt,
which, at Dollars 14.7bn, forms only half of Nigeria's debt. Second, because
the amount of debt written off for the first 15 countries to receive
Trinidad terms relief represents just 3 per cent of their total outstanding
debts.
They must wait for a review three years hence for any prospect of the debt
relief they so badly need. Little wonder that the World Bank, in its World
Debt Tables 1992-1993, itself concluded that 'in several severely indebted
low income countries, debt burdens remain at unsustainably high levels, even
after the application of the Trinidad terms'.
There is the broader question that without assistance now, which the World
Bank and IMF have so far refused to give, there cannot be a successful
transfer of power to a civilian government later this year.

FT  27 APR 93 / Letter: Red tape will be cut from waste laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID MACLEAN MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have a lot of sympathy with the letter that you published (April 21)
from David Brown of the Federation of Small Businesses about the burden of
waste law on business. I am personally dedicated to cutting red tape on
business. Any new regulation on the environment that reaches my desk has to
justify itself. We are also launching a deregulatory review of existing
controls, including those on waste.
The particular target in Mr Brown's letter is the definition of waste.
Whether or not anyone thinks it a sensible one, I have to point out that it
is not new - a definition of identical effect has been in force since 1976.
The courts ruled several years ago that waste can still be waste even if it
has value. The definition of waste in European Community law makes the same
point, so for the present it is an established fact we have to live with.
What we do not have to live with is a system of controls on waste that is
bureaucratic nonsense. Something may be waste, but that is no reason why
what happens to it should be regulated any more than is needed to protect
the environment. Differing kinds of waste in different quantities can
produce different effects - including the pollution of aquifers and the
generation of methane gas. But some of the examples mentioned by Mr Brown -
such as a shopkeeper giving a cardboard box to a customer - there is no
earthly reason to regulate. That is why the government's proposals for new
waste licensing regulations, to come into force later this year, contain a
greatly increased number of exemptions for such obviously innocent
activities.
In other cases we have to strike a balance. Mr Brown's example of the farmer
who wants some hardcore is a good one. Anyone who opens a site where he
dumps large heaps of waste forever should be licensed. He should be able to
accept demolition hardcore for making up tracks or hard-standing without a
licence, and we shall make sure he can.
Keeping business costs down is crucial, but so is protecting the environment
appropriately.

FT  27 APR 93 / Arts: The history of sculpture, and Moore - William Packer
reviews diverse examples of the stone-carver's art / Exhibitions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The conversion, by the Jeremy Dixon/Edward Jones partnership, of a group of
Victorian offices and warehouses alongside the Leeds City Art Gallery, was
discussed in an architectural context by my FT colleague, Colin Amery, last
week. In more general terms, what it does is to give the newly constituted
Henry Moore Institute its headquarters, and the public a fine new gallery
dedicated to the display of sculpture.
The Henry Moore Centre for the Study of Sculpture was set up by the Henry
Moore Foundation in 1982 and housed within the Leeds City Art Gallery. The
Henry Moore Sculpture Trust came next, in 1988, to make work of all kinds
better available to the public. And since 1989, the Trust's active
collaboration with working sculptors has been centred upon the Henry Moore
Sculpture Studio, at Dean Clough in Halifax. For all this apparently
confusing - though hardly confused - activity the Institute will provide an
administrative heart and public focus.
However, the inaugural show is no celebration of the modern or contemporary.
Rather, in going back to some of the earliest surviving examples of English
medieval sculpture, it lays proper emphasis on a continuing and universal
tradition. It is nicely appropriate, too, to Henry Moore himself, whose
first conscious encounter with sculpture as such was with the medieval
monuments and decorative carvings in the parish church at Methley, a village
between Castleford and Leeds, to which he was taken by his schoolmaster as a
boy.
Rather more ironically apropos is the story Moore often cited of the carving
rolled down the hill and reduced to its truer self as all the unnecessary
bits were knocked away. At Leeds, with the more-or-less life-size figures
from the West Front of York Minster which dominate the exhibition, are
sculptures not so much with the unnecessary bits knocked off as with
virtually all the bits knocked off, mere ghosts and dim echoes of
sculptures, so grievously are they eroded.
They remain extraordinary objects, the physical nature of their substance
wonderfully revealed in the weathering and pitting that reduces the
limestone to honeycomb. But to claim such residue as art is wishful
thinking. What it might have been is another matter. Certain of these
figures - and the rather better-preserved fragments and reliefs from York
itself, Gisborough, Lincoln and elsewhere - do more than enough to tell us
what has been lost. They do this by their own vigour, formal invention and
refined simplicity. Devils devour a sinner's soul: a mason carves at a block
of stone. Such images touch the heart across the centuries.
The importance of the art-historical research into these works is undoubted,
and already it has been established that the York figures long pre-date the
14th century West Front, with which they had always been assumed
contemporary. But scholarship, however worthy, does not always make for
successful exhibitions. Here the Romanesque would have been a subject
entirely appropriate to the occasion of this brave new departure, but sadly,
in the event, this exhibition is a misjudgment and a disappointment.
Over at Kirkstall Abbey, an incongruously complete and magnificent ruin in a
Leeds suburb, the German sculptor, Ulrich Ruckreim has installed a series of
works in the north arcade, which appears made for the spot. Ruckreim is a
minimalist, but a romantic minimalist, splitting open his blocks of stone in
a way that both celebrates the material itself, in its mass and physical
texture, and the manner of his working it - the drilling and cutting and
splitting.
Here he also responds directly to the setting, putting the component pieces
of these works through as many permutations, but making each single work
conform to a consistent buttress-like image that both echoes and opposes the
ambient gothic architecture. And if, in the event, his work here serves to
celebrate the great spaces of the Abbey rather than itself, it is as clear
that Ruckreim is as moved by them as we are, turning with us to consider the
high vaults, the great void of the West Window, and the sky above.
Jorgen Sorensen is a Danish sculptor of international reputation, yet one
who is barely known in Britain. Indeed, this exhibition at the Yorkshire
Sculpture Park is his first substantial showing in Britain in a 30-year
career. Set in the Park's upper spaces, high above Bretton Hall near
Wakefield and the valley beyond, his work could hardly be seen to better
advantage. In particular, never before has he had the opportunity to throw
his work up so high against the sky.
He too is now principally a carver and a consummate carver at that, working
the surface of the stone with the utmost subtlety and variety of tone and
texture, yet never sacrificing an essential and monumental simplicity that
lately has grown ever simpler.
Here he shows only his non-figurative work, resting mass upon mass to be
held by sheer weight alone and, like Ruckreim, leaving the marks of drill
and wedge to declare themselves.
And yet, for all their massiveness, these things retain a curious humanity,
if not of scale then at least of feeling. The great granite piece that
stands alone in the centre of the sloping Bothy Garden, abstract as it is,
recalls nothing so much as one of the late two- or three-piece reclining
figures of Henry Moore - an indirect and unconscious homage perhaps, but in
these circumstances wonderfully appropriate.

An animal with eyes on stalks and lots of legs will terrify people even if
humans are thousands of times bigger and heavier, but such is our
anthropomorphism that a much bigger animal will cause cooings of delight if
it simply does something supposedly characteristic of humans. Hence the
appeal of the meerkat, which looks like a cross between a dog and a monkey
and stands on its hind legs to watch for predators. 'Meerkats United' is
repeated today in David Attenborough's Wildlife 100 collection (7.00 BBC1).
In today's The Great Picture Trail National Gallery director Neil MacGregor
talks about Velasquez's 'Old Woman Cooking Eggs' and Manet's 'Bar At The
Folies Bergere' which, for some reason, always seems to be chosen, as here,
for any collection of reproductions destined for the walls of schools (7.35
BBC2). BBC2's foreign affairs series Assignment screens the programme about
the illegal export of religious icons from Russia which was postponed last
week (7.45). 40 Minutes considers the life of comedian Ernie Wise without
his teammate, the late Eric Morecambe (9.50 BBC2).

FT  27 APR 93 / Arts: Chekhov meets the Brooklyn sisters - Broadway Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What a joy to pass a few hours in the company of the sisters Rosensweig,
each as lovely as Wendy Wasserstein's play about them, which has transferred
to the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on Broadway after a sold-out off-Broadway
run.
They are achievers, those three Rosensweig girls, born in Flatbush, Brooklyn
and now living individually exceptional lives across the globe, who come
together for eldest sister Sara's 54th birthday at her home in Queen Anne's
Gate, London.
The clash and mingle of British and American cultures is more than the
subject of this play but its formal lineage. The Sisters Rosensweig combines
the wit and style of a British drawing room comedy - everyone here is
clever, accomplished, wealthy, or at least good-looking, and always has a
great exit line - with the inward focus of the American family drama, and
spices it all with a dash of Chekhov.
The play is steeped in Jewish references which lend it not only much of its
humor but its deepest resonance: the Rosensweigs cannot move forward,
Wasserstein suggests, until they can live with their cultural past, as Jews,
Americans, and women. Like their Chekhovian predecessors these three sisters
are in search of an elusive moment of happiness, but this is not a play of
smouldering subtext and compromised desires. The Rosensweigs, like the women
in Wasserstein's previous plays, Uncommon Women and Others, Isn't It
Romantic, and the Pulitzer-prize-winning The Heidi Chronicles, are finding
their way to their own personal Moscows.
The Sisters Rosensweig is set during 1991, the breakup of the Soviet Union
provides a symbolic equivalent to the shakeups happening between and within
the characters on stage. The sister whose world needs and gets the most
shaking is Sara Goode (Jane Alexander), a high-powered manager for the
Hongkong Shanghai Bank who lives in London with her teenaged daughter Tess
(Julie Dretzin).
England is the perfect place for Sara to hide from herself: 'What a relief,'
she says, 'to live in a country where your emotions are openly repressed.'
Tess is less impressed with expatriate life: she is threatening to join the
Lithuanian resistance with her witless working-class boyfriend (Patrick
Fitzgerald).
The shaking starts for Sara when Merv (Robert Klein), an American
faux-furrier and passionate Zionist, crashes her birthday party. In town for
the party is Sara's youngest sister Pfeni (Christine Estabrook), a restless
travel writer who 'leads her life like she's on an extended Junior year
abroad.' Pfeni's inability to find permanence extends to her romantic life:
her lover, Geoffery, a British theatre director (John Vickery, in a
wonderfully showy turn), is bisexual.
Completing the trio is Gorgeous Teitelbaum (Madeline Kahn), a radio pop
psychologist and wife of a wealthy Boston lawyer, who comes to London
leading a tour of her temple women's group. The character, which could
easily be a brassy cliche, is in Wasserstein's sensitive writing and Kahn's
brilliantly understated performance, a suburban sage. Gorgeous's hilariously
aphoristic yenta-ing: 'You can't judge a book by its cover,' she tells Pfeni
about Geoffery, 'but it seems to me that you are in the wrong library,'
masks her own secrets and deceptions.
Daniel Sullivan's direction is as elegant, subtle, and attentive to detail
as John Lee Beatty's set and Jane Greenwood's costumes. Jane Alexander
brings just the right combination of defensiveness and gentleness to Sara;
her performance is perfectly observed down to her touch of British accent.
Robert Klein, best known as a comedian, is a less polished actor than the
others, but his rough edges make him a wholly plausible Merv: out of place,
but full of a singular charm.
Estabrook seems implausibly wan for a woman who has made a career as
unconventional as Pfeni's, but the problem lies as much in the writing as in
her performance. Pfeni's personal journey is less satisfying than her
sisters'; she wafts off at the end of the play as she entered it, still 'a
wandering Jew.' Perhaps Wasserstein is leaving room for The Sisters
Rosensweig II: Pfeni's Return? We can only hope.

FT  27 APR 93 / Arts: A deserved promotion - London Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When it is promoted from pit to concert platform the Orchestra of Covent
Garden's Royal Opera House can more than give the London orchestras a run
for their money. Last year it made its South Bank debut in a concert of
Richard Strauss; on Sunday it returned to London's Royal Festival Hall,
again conducted by Bernard Haitink and with Felicity Lott as soloist.
Haitink first introduced the ROH Orchestra to the orchestral repertory in
the series of 'Garden Concerts', which took place on the ROH stage. Those
programmes made a point of including new commissions from British composers,
but on the South Bank so far the choice of works has been much more
conservative. There was not much sense of enterprise about this latest
selection of Berlioz, Ravel and Shostakovich, but the performances
transformed it into a memorable occasion.
Haitink's account of the Overture to Benvenuto Cellini was unexpectedly
rich-toned and muscular; although not especially French in timbre or rhythm
it was still convincingly powerful, Berlioz as viewed from an uncluttered
Beethovenian perspective. Ravel's Sheherazade, though, caught all the
appropriate French inflections. The refinement of the orchestra's pianissimo
playing and the poise of its woodwind principals provided Lott's performance
with a beautifully shaded halo. Her tone was not as radiantly full as one
might have hoped, but the attention to verbal detail and the expressive
nudges projected each song intelligently.
There is a refreshing lack of self-regard in the ROH Orchestra's playing; a
couple of times, as in the scherzo to Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony, a band
used to showing itself off might have turned on a more extravert display.
Haitink's view of the symphony, in any case, does not lend itself to
anything so meritricious. It continues to develop its depth and power,
pivoted about remorseless unfoldings of the first movement and the Largo
which made full use of the orchestra's prodigious dynamic range and plunging
into the finale with heedless abandon, yet braking to a pained slowness for
that final exploration of its empty rhetorical themes. This was the precise
antidote to Solti's inert performance of the Fifth with the Vienna
Philharmonic in the same hall earlier this year, and as disturbing as any
imaginable account could be.

FT  27 APR 93 / Arts: Beauty relocated - New York Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID VAUGHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The San Francisco Ballet can lay claim to being the oldest company in
America: the San Francisco Opera Ballet was formed in 1933 with the
Diaghilev dancer Adolph Bolm as ballet master. But from the late 1930s the
company was chiefly identified with the Christensen brothers: William
(artistic director), Harold (director of the company's school), and
especially Lew, Balanchine's first American Apollo, who succeeded William in
1951.
From early on, therefore, there was a Balanchine connection, reaffirmed in
1985 when Helgi Tomasson left New York City Ballet to take over the company
after Lew Christensen's death in 1984. The company's claim to national
status was boosted by seasons at the Kennedy Center in Washington in 1990
and at the New York City Center in 1991. It recently played for a week at
the New York State Theater in Lincoln Center, and the larger stage made it
possible to show Tomasson's production of Swan Lake, dating from 1988.
The original libretto states that 'the action takes place in Germany.' Not
so in Tomasson's version: he has set it in 18th century France, with insipid
designs by Jens-Jacob Worsaae. The first act begins with a frozen tableau
perhaps meant to suggest a fete champetre after Watteau; the third act is in
a salon decorated with paintings of the school of Boucher, behind one of
which the vision of the betrayed Odette will appear. If Tchaikovsky had
intended the ballet to happen in that place and time, he would no doubt have
written music evocative of them.
Tomasson does not appear to have any particular point to make by relocating
the ballet this way: this is not a 'concept' production. Until the last act,
he follows the usual sequence of numbers, more or less, except in Act II and
the 'Black Swan' pas de deux in Act III he has changed all the steps, to
very little effect. Then in Act IV he has thrown out most of the music and
interpolated Tchaikovsky's 'Serenade melancolique' as another pas de deux
for Odette and Siegfried. (What branch of the French nobility does he belong
to?)
The corps de ballet, which plays such a powerful role in both the Ivanov and
Ashton versions of this act, has very little to do. This is too bad, since
the corps made a strong impression in the second act. In general, this is a
finely schooled company that up to now has lacked a world-class ballerina.
Elizabeth Loscavio, who danced Odette/Odile on opening night in New York,
has shown promise of becoming one and her Odile proved that she has
technique to burn; her Odette was well thought-out - too well, it looked
almost calculated at times.
The dancer everyone in New York wanted to see was Tina LeBlanc, who left the
Joffrey Ballet to join the San Francisco Ballet last year. On the second
night of the San Francisco Ballet season she appeared in a very
uncharacteristic role, the first ballerina in Rubies, and gave it a wit,
freshness, and feminine charm it has not had since its originator, Patricia
McBride.
Rubies was the only Balanchine work shown in this brief season. The rest
suggested that the company, like all companies today, has a repertory
problem. Tomasson's works are not terrible; not in bad taste, not grossly
unmusical, just not very interesting. He has also brought in the kind of
works that represent today's international style in ballet: ballets by
William Forsythe, James Kudelka, Glen Tetley (the Tetley piece was not given
in New York). A Mark Morris work is promised for next year, a hopeful sign,
except that it is anybody's guess whether the choice arose from some
conviction as to the direction the company should take, or because Morris,
like Forsythe, is fashionable just now.

FT  27 APR 93 / Business and the Law: Insurers search for some cover - The
IRA's latest bombing in the City of London may force the government to speed
up legislation to insure property against terrorist action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The IRA bomb in the City of London at the weekend has underlined the urgency
of introducing as swiftly as possible the government-backed scheme for
insuring commercial property against terrorist bomb damage.
Last December - 10 months after the IRA's first big bomb in the City which
caused an estimated Pounds 350m damage - the government agreed to act as
'reinsurer of last resort'. But legislation to bring the scheme into
operation has yet to be presented to parliament.
Until it is, the insurance industry must continue to rely on Department of
Trade and Industry assurances that it will pick up the bill for
terrorist-inflicted damage.
Pool Re, the mutual reinsurance company set up by the insurance industry to
manage the proposed terrorism fund, began collecting monies for the pool in
January. But the estimated Pounds 300m-Pounds 400m cost of repairs arising
from Saturday's bomb in Bishopsgate will more than exhaust the premium
income collected so far, leaving the government and the insurance industry
(which has agreed to bear 10 per cent of the excess reinsurance costs) to
stump up as much as Pounds 200m.
With Pool Re's existing funds likely to be absorbed by claims from the
weekend bombing, the government will have to bear the bulk of the cost of
any further IRA attacks on mainland Britain this year.
The Association of British Insurers (ABI) called at the weekend for the
legislation to enact Pool Re to be brought forward from its planned
implementation date in mid-May.
However, there are still several problems with the scheme itself which
remain to be resolved before the enabling legislation can be introduced.
Many of the scheme's details remain sketchy.
Property owners and insurance purchasers, who welcomed the government's
earlier decision to fill the gap created when the insurers own reinsurers
withdrew support for terrorism cover last November, have expressed doubts
about Pool Re's viability.
Under the proposed scheme participating insurance companies and syndicates
would all charge the same level of premium for cover against terrorism;
premiums would be determined by factors such as the sum insured and the
location of the property. The premiums would go into a pool to be managed by
Pool Re and would be used to meet all claims up to an amount equal to the
reinsurance company's annual premium income; the government would reinsure
most claims in excess of that amount.
Beyond this little is known about how the scheme would operate. No one, for
example, seems sure about the size of the pool. The government expects the
pool to attract about Pounds 500m a year in premium income; the ABI is less
optimistic, suggesting a pool of Pounds 250m-Pounds 300m.
After Saturday's bomb that figure looks woefully inadequate. So how can the
size of the fund be increased? Should it be compulsory to purchase
additional cover against terrorism possibly through the imposition of a
standard levy on all commercial insurance policies?
And what would happen to the pool if no claims were made during a particular
year. Would companies receive a contributions holiday the following year? If
there are no claims who would share in the profits?
These questions are typical of the concerns voiced by the Association of
Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce (AIRMIC). At a recent
AIRMIC conference, members (companies which buy their own insurance on the
market) raised several serious reservations about the scheme:
the heavy cost of administering quotations;
the unclear position of captive insurance companies set up offshore by
companies such as Imperial Chemical Industries to insure their own
businesses; will they be able to buy into Pool Re?
doubts about whether the scheme would cover the cost of disruption for
businesses;
the difficulty of defining terrorist-inflicted losses where companies have
not insured against such damage.
ambiguity over office blocks with multiple leases. What is the position of
tenants who are covered against terrorism while others in the same building
are not?
Because of the uncertainty over a scheme described by the AIRMIC as vague
and impractical some companies are looking for cover elsewhere in the
market; they are also becoming increasingly selective in their purchase of
terrorism cover, insuring some buildings in high-risk areas such as central
London but leaving buildings in lower risk areas uncovered.
Before the IRA bombing in Warrington last month such an approach might have
been acceptable. Today it constitutes an extremely risky strategy, says the
AIRMIC. 'If a company without cover suffers a big hit, it could be ruined.
What would its shareholders and bankers say?' an AIRMIC spokesman says.
Property owners share most of these concerns but raise one more significant
problem which could ultimately prove fatal to the scheme's success.
According to Mr David Knight, a property lawyer with City solicitors Lovell
White Durrant, one of the most worrying aspects of the scheme from the
insured's point of view is that it is the only option available in the
market; as all insurance companies and Lloyd's syndicates are likely to
offer the same quote, there is no opportunity to shop around. The insured
must take what is on offer. That, he says, may have serious implications
under EC competition law.
Ms Pat Treacy, a competition lawyer with Lovells, believes an agreement or
arrangement between the insurance companies and the Lloyd's syndicates
participating in the new scheme could contravene EC competition rules.
'Where a number of competing insurance undertakings enter into an
arrangement under which they will provide cover only through an agreed
mechanism which will enable them to demand uniform higher premiums in such a
way as to minimise risk to themselves and to decrease cover for the insured,
that arrangement may well fall within the scope of Article 85 of the Rome
treaty,' she says.
Article 85 prohibits anti-competitive agreements or arrangements which have
an effect on trade between member states of the EC. To avoid the risk of the
arrangment being declared unlawful and insurance companies incurring fines,
the insurers would have to obtain an exemption for the agreement from the
European Commission; companies could either seek an individual exemption or
a block exemption for agreements in the insurance sector which came into
force on April 1. Obtaining an exemption will be difficult.
However, privately, the ABI appears to be quietly confident of winning an
exemption for the scheme.
The ABI says it is aware of the potential competition problems and that it
is in contact with Brussels over the issue. The AIRMIC, however, is more
dismissive of the competition issue. 'Without Pool Re there would be no
cover. Why would any company want to see it struck down?' it says.
Lovell's lawyers say property owners are relieved the government has agreed
to act as 'reinsurer of last resort' and are anxious not to rock the boat.
However, property owners and other interested parties dissatisfied with Pool
Re could still lobby the Commission if they oppose the final shape of the
scheme. Lovells, which believes the scheme may eventually be accepted by
Brussels, says it will be advising its clients that such a course of action
would be a legitimate option to enforce change.
Whatever the merits of such tactics it is clear that there are still many
problems with the Pool Re scheme. Saturday's bomb is a reminder that time is
not on the government's side.

FT  27 APR 93 / Business and the Law: Peugeot supply ruling upheld -
European Court

<TEXT>
A refusal by Peugeot, the French car maker, to supply cars to a company
specialising in parallel imports has been declared unlawful by the European
Court of First Instance.
The court upheld a European Commission decision that Peugeot's refusal to
supply Eco System, a French car importer, was contrary to EC competition
rules. The Commission found the refusal to supply hindered the importation
into France of new Peugeot cars bought in Belgium and Luxembourg by French
consumers who used Eco System as a professional intermediary. It also said
Peugeot's action did not come within the scope of the block exemption
relating to certain categories of car distribution and servicing agreements.
Peugeot argued that its refusal to supply was covered by the block
exemption. Although the block exemption specifically authorised the sale of
cars by a distributor to the final consumer who used an independent
intermediary for the purpose of purchasing the car, Eco System was not just
an independent intermediary but in fact acted as a reseller, Peugeot said.
Under the terms of the block exemption, it was lawful for a distributor
within an exempted network to refuse to supply independent resellers.
The court was not convinced by these arguments. It found Eco System was not
acting as a reseller and that therefore Peugeot's actions could not be
validated by virtue of the block exemption.
T-9/92: Automobiles Peugeot SA and Peugeot SA v Commission, CFI 2CH, 22nd
April 1993.
Interpretation of the scope of the Brussels Convention
In a reference from the German Bundesgerichtshof, the Court gave a
preliminary ruling on aspects of the Brussels Convention, which sets out the
rules for the jurisdiction and enforcement of civil judgments in the EC. The
case involved the death of a German school boy while on a trip to Italy.
The teacher in charge of the trip was charged in Italy with manslaughter.
The boy's family intervened in the case, bringing a civil suit for damages
against the teacher. The Italian court found the teacher guilty of
manslaughter and awarded damages of L20m (Pounds 8,500).
The German courts, on application from the family, ordered the enforcement
of the damages award. The teacher appealed this decision. The appeal court
held that he was liable to pay the damages as the judgment of the Italian
court fell within the scope of the Brussels Convention. This decision was
further appealed, and it was during the course of this action that reference
was made to the European Court.
The court ruled that the Brussels Convention applied to civil matters,
whether they were brought before civil or criminal courts.
It then had to determine whether the teacher, who at the time of the
incident was employed by the local authority, was acting in the exercise of
his public duties as the Brussels Convention does not apply to
administrative matters, which is taken to include those matters involving
the exercise of public authority powers. The court found that although the
teacher was a civil servant he was not at the time of the school trip
exercising his public authority powers. This was so even if under German
law, he was assumed to be acting under such powers. The case was therefore
covered by the Brussels Convention.

In last week's column, in the report of Case C-19/92: Kraus v Land
Baden-Wurttemberg, the sum of money referred to should have been DM130, not

FT  27 APR 93 / People: Hutchinson's visa for new job
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Four months after leaving Nationwide Building Society when his job
disappeared, John Hutchinson has stepped into a new post at Visa
International. Nationwide's former corporate strategy director is to become
Visa's UK managing director.
Hutchinson was employed by Nationwide to develop strat-egies for
diversifications such as moves into selling insurance in branches, but lost
his post in December when the society decided to concentrate on its core
business.
The intervening months gave him time to think. 'It is never an easy time
when you are casting around trying to sort out the future. But it gave me
some time to think about what I enjoyed, and what suited me,' he says.
He came to the conclusion that he would like a strategy job connected with
credit cards, having headed Lloyds bank's Visa card operations earlier in
his career. 'I have been very close to credit cards for a long time,' he
says.
It also suited Visa to take him on for a new post with responsibility for UK
operations within Visa's Europe, Middle East and Africa operations.
Hutchinson envisages eventually heading a policy staff of no more than 20
people.
Hutchinson will report to Jean-Jacques Desbons, chief executive of Visa
International for the region. He will also report to the Visa UK board
representing the 43 banks and building societies which wanted a director for
Britain.

FT  27 APR 93 / Technology: Three-D vision of the future - IBM's new
graphics system is an effort to marry R&amp;D with commercial instinct
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The images are stunning: a sleek red sports car turns slowly and cruises off
screen; a blue-green rendering of the earth's atmosphere shows how the ozone
layer is thinning alarmingly; red balloons drift through a group of
near-abstract futuristic buildings.
Capping all this, the viewer - wearing special glasses - is treated to
three-dimensional pictures of breaking pottery, with fragments spilling in
slow motion off the big high-definition screen, and a sinister-looking metal
container with forked arms which pursues autumn leaves as they scatter
across a garden and appears to enter the room.
Producing this blend of realistic and toy-like images is IBM's Power
Visualisation System, now being sold to scientific institutions, special
effects studios and industrial users in the US and abroad. PVS costs between
Dollars 300,000 and Dollars 1m (Pounds 200,000 and Pounds 677,000), can be
hooked up to supercomputers or used with parallel processing systems for
increased power, and can be combined with a variety of software and
connecting equipment.
But more important than all of PVS's capabilities and potential is what this
advanced computer graphics system represents for IBM, now no longer the
overlord of the world computer industry and struggling to regain profits and
credibility in fragmenting markets.
That challenge thrusts deep into the heart of IBM, affecting not only its
products and marketing operations, but also its research activities. For
PVS, like several other new products including speech recognition and
multimedia conference systems, was developed in the group's research
facilities and not by one of the product divisions.
'We have to run like hell to survive,' says Jim McGroddy, IBM's director of
research. 'As a company, we've not been in enough of a hurry. We've not felt
the heat of the market so much.' With group losses last year of some Dollars
5bn, further heavy job cuts in prospect and a tough new chief executive
appointed from outside to stop the financial rot, the heat inside IBM has
become scorching. Every part has to justify its existence.
That is true of the research activities - headquartered in New York state
and employing 3,300 people in the US (including California), Switzerland,
Japan and Israel - just as it is for other more commercially exposed parts
of the business. The research division's funding has been cut by 10 per cent
to Dollars 500m this year, though there are hopes that some will be made up
from federal sources. (IBM's total research and development budget was
Dollars 6.5bn in 1992.)
In the present harsh business climate, IBM's research unit is determined to
show that it can combine its scientific and electronics skills, which have
yielded several Nobel prizes and a third of IBM's 30,000 worldwide patents,
with the hard-nosed commercial abilities needed to succeed in the market
place.
That means pushing beyond IBM's traditional areas of mainstream computer
activity into new markets. According to Mark Bregman, head of technical
plans and controls at the research division: 'In the last five to seven
years, the principle value creation in information technology has come from
the formation and exploitation of new business segments rather than just the
expansion of existing segments.'
As well as being developed by IBM's research division, PVS is also managed
and marketed from there. Previously, when a product idea was identified as
being commercially viable, it was developed by one of the concern's
operating divisions. The decision to invest depended on whether there was an
IBM unit in the relevant business. 'If there was not an IBM partner, most
often it would be decided not to invest,' Bregman notes.
Since there was no obvious IBM operation to bring PVS to end-users, the
research division decided to run with the system itself. 'It was aimed at a
market where IBM is not a major player,' says Armando Garcia, research
director of visualisation systems.
Convinced of PVS's future, and backed by IBM executives, the research
division sank Dollars 20m into the system's development and brought it to
the commercial stage in less than two years. Normally, this would have taken
twice as long. A special team was set up to propel PVS, with its own Data
Explorer software, from the laboratory to the market place.
When this had been done, PVS's managers faced the problem of convincing the
market of its uses. In the entertainment world, this has not been too hard.
The special effects that can be generated by PVS are an obvious asset in the
constant Hollywood battle for big screen success. IBM has sold the system to
several US film studios.
Scientific applications are also fairly easy to identify, as huge volumes of
data can be transformed into animated visual images with PVS. These can be
spun round, shrunk and blown up, or twisted into new shapes. Thus scientists
can view and analyse complex arrays of information in new ways. Examples
include the mapping of the ozone layer's deterioration, simulated chemical
interactions and medical scanning images. Both Cornell and Princeton
universities have PVS equipment.
The real test, though, will be the extent to which IBM can move its
research-derived products into the wider industrial and business world.
Honda of Japan has a PVS system and European car companies are also showing
some interest. With PVS, says IBM, manufacturers can speed up car design by
dispensing with clay models.
Yet some in the industry remain to be persuaded, says Garcia. 'True car
designers are still not convinced they can dispense with traditional tools.'
This is where IBM's researchers, many of whom are more used to talking and
thinking along scientific rather than commercial lines, have to ally
themselves with marketing experts.
PVS is in competition with other high-powered systems sold by companies such
as Silicon Graphics, Qantel and Kodak. It is not meant to replace
supercomputers like Cray's, but to be used with them if necessary. According
to Eric Rosencrans, marketing manager for PVS, the next step is to sell the
system as an analytical tool to financial institutions and industrial
companies, to provide them with improved visual means of monitoring
performance and understanding how the parts of their operations interact.
But to do this, IBM will have to make its systems more readily usable by
managers who know little or nothing about computers. The group has not
always been good at exploiting its technologies. It was slow, for example,
to bring out its own computer using Risc (reduced instruction set computing)
which it invented in the mid-1970s.
To inject the necessary urgency and financial discipline into research
projects which enter the commercial category, strict criteria have been laid
down. Projects are evaluated on the basis of what they are trying to
achieve, how this can be recognised so as to prevent them from becoming
open-ended, and the value to IBM. That value used to focus on higher
revenues or lower costs. Now, explains Bregman, 'it is increasingly used in
a broader sense to include new markets and new businesses'.
One of these is rapid prototyping, an industrial design tool aimed at giving
engineers an actual plastic model of what they are trying to create. This
example, not yet on the market, illustrates what McGroddy means when he
talks of 'entering the white space' where IBM has traditionally not
ventured. IBM's researchers insist that such activities do not mean it will
weaken its commitment to fundamental research.
Instead, they hope that the flow of funds back from the sale of successful
products will be used, at least partly, to enhance the research spending. If
IBM can pull its new ideas out of the research laboratories and put them
into the market place quickly enough, it could gain a new entrepreneurial
impetus at a time when this is desperately needed. If not, the white space
it is so keen to enter will be blinding rather than enlightening.

FT  27 APR 93 / Technology: Concorde's heavy use of protocol - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN GILBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER the last few years, HIV-infected patients have faced a bewildering
barrage of press opinion about the efficacy of Wellcome's drug Retrovir.
The latest episode occurred earlier this month when a press conference from
an Anglo-French trial called Concorde revealed preliminary data that
suggested there was no benefit among people in the early stages of
HIV-infection after three years of treatment.
This conclusion contrasted with other Retrovir trials, such as the one-year
study published in August 1989 which was acclaimed as providing some hope in
deferring the disease.
To those present at the US Food and Drug Administration meeting in January
1990, it will come as little surprise that the benefits of Retrovir could
decline over time. Nevertheless, the preliminary conclusions of the Concorde
trial seem discouraging.
A recent article in the British Medical Journal supports Wellcome's view
that changes in protocol make any meaningful analysis difficult. The main
problem is that about 40 per cent of people who initially received a placebo
changed early to Retrovir for compassionate reasons.
The article also quotes Ian Weller, a principal investigator in the trial.
He says the only way to analyse the data was on a so-called
'intention-to-treat' basis. This means that patients who start in a control
group remain there for statistical purposes regardless of whether they
continue taking the placebo.
'Any statistician will tell you that unless you do this, you destroy the
randomisation of the study. You can't just forget people who stopped or
started taking the capsules or it introduces bias,' claims Weller.
Intention to treat analysis is discussed in a number of recent articles. A
standard discussion is included in the 1990 book 'Statistical issues in Drug
R&amp;D'.
This article supports the general principle of intention to treat analysis.
But it does raise a number of practical questions about its limitations,
pointing out that one crucial problem in clinical trials is that they
rarely, if ever, can be performed without flaw. There is, for example, a
danger that patients may not comply perfectly with the assigned therapy or
they may deviate under medical advice.
Problems of this nature are of particular concern in a long-term clinical
trial with large numbers of people involved, especially in Aids therapy
where popular advice tends to influence the patients involved in the trial.
Similar concerns are raised in a second article, 'The application of the
principle of intention to treat to the analysis of clinical trials' (Gilling
and Koch, in Drug Information Journal P41 1, 1991). Though this article
emphasises the need to follow intention to treat analysis, it recognises the
problems of meaningful analysis when the original trial protocol is breached
to a significant extent.
Weller, therefore, appears to be sticking rigidly to the principle of
intention to treat. Given the number of changes from protocol in this trial,
one must query the strength of Weller's conclusion.
Results of another Retrovir trial in early-stage patients are to be reported
shortly and doubtless will lead to a similar worldwide debate on the merits
of this therapy.
A recent article in Nature, demonstrating how HIV infects large numbers of
cells in the lymph glands during the early phase of the infection, has
received comparatively little publicity outside the medical press.
This explains how the disease was progressing during the latent phase even
when difficult or impossible to detect in the bloodstream. It indicates the
importance of starting drug therapy at the earliest stages of infection.
The Concorde study's preliminary findings indicated that Retrovir was
well-tolerated. It must be hoped that combination therapy, using Retrovir,
will provide a greater level of success in deferring the onset of the
disease.

FT  27 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Travelling the Globe - An
innovative export scheme which might be just the ticket for unemployed
managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stephen Elliott covered 4,000 kilometres of German motorway in eight days
earlier this year, visiting 14 companies in process.
Like any other export salesman, Elliott was attempting to interest potential
buyers in his company's products. HVR International, a Tyneside-based
manufacturer of high voltage resistors used mainly in electrical switchgear,
is keen to get more of its products used in industrial applications.
Unlike other salesmen, Elliott was not on the full-time payroll, though HVR
does employ 36 people. He was on a five-month assignment to the company as
part of an innovative exporting scheme devised by Project North East (PNE*),
a Newcastle-upon-Tyne enterprise agency.
PNE's Globe programme places unemployed managers who have a degree or a
professional qualification with small and medium-sized companies trying to
develop their export business.
Globe (the Graduate Level Overseas Business Exchange) allows companies which
could not afford to take on a full-time export manager to test overseas
markets. 'Smaller companies often don't have the time, the resources or the
contacts to do this on their own,' says Colin Weatherspoon, manager of the
Globe programme.
Globe is intended primarily for companies which are 'passive exporters',
responding to the occasional overseas order but unable to develop an active
exporting strategy. They pay up to a quarter of the Pounds 4,000 cost of the
programme while the secondees have continued to receive their unemployment
benefit. PNE hopes this year to replace this with a system whereby companies
pay a salary to secondees, of about Pounds 150 a week, but make no direct
contribution to the programme.
The unemployed managers start in October with eight weeks of training from
PNE and the University of Northumbria in international marketing,
negotiating and selling skills. They then spend three months on assignment
with a company learning about its products and its business and carrying out
market research. Towards the end of their assignment, in February, they
spend a fortnight in continental Europe following up phone leads and
visiting potential customers.
Another Tyneside company, Kirkdale Engineering, fitted the Globe criteria
perfectly. Kirkdale, a sub-contract engineer with sales of Pounds 1.7m and
38 employees, makes only 2 per cent of sales outside the UK.
But co-founder and director John Jobling sees good prospects overseas for
his company's speciality, rotational moulding tooling used in making plastic
products such as road cones and litter bins. 'To survive we have to grow and
the only growth can come from exports,' says Jobling.
At the suggestion of PNE, which was already providing financial advice,
Jobling acquired the services of Charles Scales, an unemployed manager in
his late 30s with experience of manufacturing.
Working much of the time from home, Scales researched the continental
marketplace before spending a fortnight visiting potential customers in
Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium.
Jobling says he expected to wait six months for Scales's efforts to produce
results but earlier this month he received his first order, worth Pounds
11,000, from Germany. He believes two other inquiries, one from Germany, one
from the Netherlands, will become orders.
Elliott's company, HVR International, was already an experienced exporter,
selling 80 per cent of its Pounds 1.5m turnover overseas. But existing
export business took up all the time of the company's three-strong sales and
marketing team and there was no one available to open up new markets.
Roger Manning, managing director, had drawn up a five-year growth plan which
envisaged an increase in sales to Pounds 3.5m. Vital to the plan was a
reduction of the company's dependence on the switchgear market and expansion
into fields such as industrial controls and factory automation. HVR had one
particular product on its books developed for a US customer but never
exploited in Europe.
Elliott took this product to potential German customers and has already
produced two small orders. Like many of the other Globe participants,
Elliott did not have a marketing background - he has qualifications in
mechanical engineering and accountancy - but this was not a handicap, says
PNE's Paul Sampson. An engineering background gave participants a head start
in understanding the products they were selling and their applications.
Language skills were a bonus but did not prove absolutely necessary for
participants, says Sampson. Elliott spoke enough German to get through to
the design engineers he needed to reach and once he had found them they were
willing and able to speak English.
But helping north-east companies get into overseas markets is only half of
the Globe project. It is also intended to help the unemployed managers find
jobs, if possible in the company to which they are allocated. Kirkdale was
not able to offer Scales a job but HVR has kept Elliott on for a further six
months. If this works out he can expect to be offered a senior job, says
Manning.
As the Globe initiative has evolved - Weatherspoon is now working on the
third programme - it has had to move upscale. It started out supporting
companies with between 10 and 15 employees but these were too small to
sustain the export drive or to offer a job to the secondee.
The third programme is targetting companies employing between 30 and 250
people though Weatherspoon is concerned that this shuts out the smaller
business. 'Maybe there are other ways of helping them,' he muses.
Pitched at companies of a suitable size, Globe appears to provide a valuable
service. 'If we hadn't taken part in this project we would have had to do
the job in-house in the tea break,' says Jobling. 'It would have taken us
two years to get this far if we had been doing it ourselves.'

FT  27 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Revenue gets tough over
late payments - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers who are late in transferring PAYE and National Insurance
contributions to the Inland Revenue face the prospect of automatic interest
charges and a more stringent implementation of penalties under new Revenue
rules, according to Touche Ross.
On April 19, employers became liable to an automatic interest charge on all
tax and NI contributions not paid over within 14 days of the end of the
payment year. Although there has been no change in the penalty rules, they
were not previously enforced with great rigour and the tougher interest
rules may prompt a more stringent regime, Touche says.
Penalties for late returns are up to Pounds 300 each with an additional
Pounds 3,000 on each incorrect return. May and June 1994 may signal a
concerted Revenue operation once the new rules have been in force for a
year, Touche warns. Employers must gear up for the new regime in time and
clarify any uncertainties with their tax office, the accountants urge.

FT  27 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): How to challenge a rates
assessment - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Businesses regard their rates bill as a fixed overhead but in many cases
they can challenge an assessment and reduce its impact, according to a new
guide from surveyors Nelson Bakewell.
The Occupier's Guide to Commercial Rates explains how the rating system
works with particular reference to the transitional arrangements brought in
following the last revaluation in 1990.
Rate demands are frequently hard to decipher because of the complexity of
the law and a lack of standardisation, layout and detail contained in the
forms, the guide states. Rating authorities often make inaccurate
assumptions or fail to apply the transitional calculations correctly.
The guide explains the circumstances in which businesses may appeal against
their rate demand and points up the importance of making sure that the next
re-rating, from April 1995 but based on notional rental values of April
1993, is accurate.

FT  27 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): 10 ways to speed payment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The upturn, when it comes, can be no excuse for easing the tighter credit
controls many businesses have introduced during the recession. Financing an
upsurge in orders requires continuing tough cash management and customers
must still be made to pay on time, according to Alex Lawrie, a factoring
company. It has a 10-point plan of action:
Evaluate the credit status of new customers and regularly review that of
existing customers. New orders are good news, unless the customer cannot or
will not pay.
Define and agree credit limits with customers. Giving unlimited credit is
dangerous. Some customers may take advantage by delaying payment on large
orders, others may go bust.
Agree payment terms with customers. State terms clearly on invoices.
Make sure invoices are sent out promptly to the correct address. Ensure they
are accurate, relate to the goods delivered and include details such as
order numbers.
Keep a record of amounts owing. The sales ledger should carry records of
sales and credit notes issued.
Follow up outstanding accounts. Check that customers have received invoices
and that they have approved payment. Issue regular monthly statements on
time. Do not hesitate to send reminder letters to overdue accounts.
Get on the phone to confirm which invoices are being paid, how much is being
paid, when and how payment will be made and who you are dealing with. Always
ask to speak to the same person. Set objectives for the phone call. They
should be to obtain payment, retain goodwill and 'make this the last call'.
Confirm in writing what has been agreed on the phone.
Do not be afraid to consider legal proceedings if payment is not
forthcoming. Often the threat is enough - 75 per cent of slow payers settle
on receipt of a solicitor's letter.
Match payments against invoices and maintain a separate record of unpaid
invoices.
CBA card with a checklist of how to handle telephone calls to slow payers is
available free. Tel. 0295 272272.

FT  27 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Buoyant Tories put money on
economic upturn - The issues dominating the likely two-horse race for next
month's Newbury by-election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR PEOPLE who could trample on the green shoots of Mr John Major's
political spring, the voters of Newbury appear remarkably calm about their
opportunity.
The risks for the prime minister are considerable. Defeat in the by-election
next Thursday would cut the government's overall majority at Westminster to
19. It would also threaten the fragile confidence beginning to emerge among
Tory MPs, especially if it was coupled with a poor performance in the county
council elections on the same day.
Liberal Democrat by-election victories in the last parliament showed that
the 9.3 per cent swing which the party would need to take the seat  - held
by the Tories with a majority of 12,300 last April - should be well within
their grasp. But they still need to find the issue to set their campaign
alight.
In villages such as Lambourn on the Berkshire downs, it is easy to see how
the constituency has been solidly Tory since 1924. In the more suburban
parts of the constituency such as Thatcham and in Newbury itself, a market
town of just under 40,000, the presence of a consistent Liberal challenge is
more apparent.
The Tory candidate is Mr Julian Davidson, the determinedly buoyant
30-year-old who fought Mr Paddy Ashdown in Yeovil in the general election.
Although his own family firm has been a victim of the recession, Mr
Davidson's message is relentlessly positive about the prospects for the
economy, and for Newbury, and particularly for the two together if he wins
the seat. It is a re-run of the general election campaign: 'vote Tory on
Thursday for recovery on Friday'.
Mr David Rendel, his Liberal Democrat opponent, has a better doorstep
manner, his attentive concern honed by four general elections as well as
involvement in local politics.
For Labour, it scarcely matters that Mr Steve Billcliffe is a competent and
irreproachably local candidate - the party polled fewer than 4,000 votes
last April. It is even split about whether it would prefer a Tory or a
Liberal Democrat victory.
Although the contest is a two-horse race, it has attracted a record 19
candidates. Beyond the usual fringe contenders are three candidates in
favour of a referendum on Maastricht, a Give the Royal Billions to Schools
candidate, and a Defence of Children's Humanity in Bosnia candidate.
On the doorstep, however, the main issue is the economy.
The constituency is still prosperous though not at the level of its
expectations in the 1980s boom years, when high-tech companies took
advantage of its prime location on the M4 corridor.
House prices have collapsed, and the unemployment rate of just under 7.5 per
cent is much higher than it was a few years ago, though it is still below
the national average.
Even so, the will to punish the government for the recession has been
weakened by some encouraging economic signs locally as well as nationally.
There are also more specialised concerns. The racing industry, an important
local employer, emphasises that the Budget decision on value added tax on
bloodstock has been a critical element in retaining support for the
Conservatives.
Mr Rendel's anti-hunting stance is suspect in such a rural area, but among
farmers the government's handling of the integrated administration and
control system is even more unpopular.
The only specific national issue to show signs of dominating has been the
Tories' unpopular Budget decision to impose VAT on domestic fuel.
While Mr Rendel says the tax change has aroused 'very strong anger', the
mood is not yet like the fury over the poll tax, which swept away a Tory
majority of 19,000 in the Ribble Valley by-election. He has also seemed
surprisingly ill-prepared for the Tory counter-attack over the Liberal
Democrat commitment to a carbon tax.
To win, the Liberal Democrats need to make VAT on domestic fuel more of a
focus for widespread anger about Conservative broken promises, and make
people believe that a vote for them will mean change. Otherwise, the Tories
look set to win by a short head.

FT  27 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Publicity offensive to back testing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday launched a publicity campaign to win support among
parents for the controversial national curriculum tests for schools in
England and Wales, John Willman writes.
Launching the Pounds 700,000 campaign, Mr John Patten, education secretary,
said it would be a tragedy if this year's tests did not go ahead.
The government's campaign includes Pounds 250,000 of press advertising to
explain the rationale behind the tests. Advertisements will be placed in
national newspapers.
Some 3m leaflets have been printed giving details of the tests, which will
be available through schools and libraries. People collecting child benefit
from post offices will also be given a copy during the weeks immediately
before the tests for 14-year-olds in June.
Mr Peter Smith of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers said that
differences over testing could not be solved by a public relations campaign.
The six unions representing school teachers in England and Wales yesterday
united to urge Mr Patten to suspend the controversial national curriculum
tests for 1993.
The unions called in a letter for the suspension of the tests pending a
review, but Mr Patten dismissed the appeal as 'an extraordinary suggestion'.

FT  27 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lilley pressed over benefits policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS aimed at focusing social security benefits increasingly on those
in need were among the options being considered by the government, Mr Peter
Lilley, social security secretary, told MPs yesterday.
He also confirmed that during the lifetime of the present parliament the
government was committed to maintaining the basic retirement pension and
uprating child benefit in line with inflation.
Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow social security secretary, pressed in vain for
more information about the policy papers discussed at the week-end by
ministers engaged in the long-term review of social security policy.
Mr Lilley declined to comment on whether a decision in principle had been
taken that those on middle incomes and above should be asked to opt out of
the basic state retirement pension, and, ultimately, from sickness and
unemployment benefit as well.
Miss Ann Widdecombe, junior social secretary, attacked Mr David Winnick,
Labour MP for Walsall North, for saying that the basic retirement pension
was no longer safe in the government's hands.
The Treasury estimates that only about 1 per cent of the additional yield
from extending VAT to all fuel and power is likely to be paid by charities,
Sir John Cope, the paymaster general, said yesterday.
'We expect almost all of the remaining additional yield will be in respect
of private households, though there is no reliable information on the
expenditure by non-private households on fuel and power.'

FT  27 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory backbenchers urge rethink on
oil tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR TORY backbenchers last night called on the government to revise its
proposed changes to the North Sea tax regime following an outcry in the oil
industry. Many companies say the government's changes to petroleum revenue
taxes would lead to a halving of exploration activity and the loss of up to
40,000 jobs.
Mr John Butterfill, Conservative MP for Bournemouth East, tabled an
amendment to the Finance Bill which would provide some transitional relief
for oil companies affected by the tax changes.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, proposed in the Budget a reduction in the
PRT rate from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and the abolition of tax relief for
exploratory drilling.
Mr John Watts, Tory chairman of the Treasury and Civil Service committee,
also urged a change to the transitional relief proposals.
In moving the oil taxation 'pendulum' from one extreme to another, the
government may have gone too far, Mr Watts said.
Speaking as the finance bill im-plementing the Budget measures received its
second Commons reading, Mr Watts said transitional relief should be allowed
in cases where companies had contractual obligations to incur expenditure
that had been entered into in the expectation that relief would apply.
Mr Butterfill, vice-chairman of the Tory Backbench finance committee, has
suggested that tax relief for exploration work to which the industry is
already commited is maintained. This could be paid for by raising the PRT
rate to 55 per cent until the end of December 1996.
The proposal addresses one of the industry's prime concerns about the new
tax regime. Many explorers were angry that tax relief would not apply to
wells they had committed to drill as part of their applications to the
Department of Trade and Industry for oil exploration licences.
The industry has committed to drill between 160 and 180 wells which would
have qualified for tax relief under the previous regime. Although the
Treasury says those wells are not legally binding, Mr Tim Eggar, industry
minister, confirmed - in a parliamentary answer - that he expects the
industry to stick to obligations made under previous licensing rounds.
Winding up last night's finance bill debate, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial
secretary to the Treasury, adopted a conciliatory tone, saying the
government recognised the need to avoid 'unnecessary dislocation' and would
endeavour to do so.
Labour and the Scottish National party both joined the calls for a rethink.
For Labour, Ms Harriet Harman, a frontbench Treasury spokeswoman, said it
was 'extraordinary' that the Finance Bill contained oil taxation measures
which 'on the chancellor's own admission' would result in at least 10,000
job losses.

FT  27 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Cross-party calls for curb on
budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY MPs yesterday joined Labour in urging further action to control the
government's budget deficit, as a Commons committee published a report
highly critical of last month's Budget.
The most critical part of the report by the Treasury and Civil Service
committee followed an ambush by opposition MPs which led to the inclusion of
a call for chancellor Norman Lamont to be replaced by someone 'who can
inspire more trust'.
This was not backed by Tory committee members, who also voted against the
report as a whole being adopted. But Conservative MPs made clear yesterday
that they shared the committee's misgivings on a variety of other issues.
Principal among these was the committee's concern that the measures
announced in the March Budget would not be enough to meet the government's
objective of bringing its budget towards balance over the economic cycle.
If the government was to achieve such a balance, further action in the form
of tax increases or cuts in public spending would be required, the report
said.
The report also expressed concern that a current account deficit of as much
as 2 per cent of gross domestic product should exist 'at the trough of a
very long and deep recession'.
It drew a comparison with the 2.6 per cent surplus at the trough of the 1981
recession and concurred with the Bank of England that this deficit
represented a 'fundamental weakness in the economy'.
On mortgages and housing finance, the committee accused the government of
embarking 'by stealth' on a policy of phasing out mortgage tax relief by
limiting its range of coverage and the rate of relief. Mr Lamont should 'now
make this policy explicit and explain the reasons behind it,' it said.
While Labour hailed the report as 'a landmark', Mr John Watts, the
committee's Tory chairman, admitted the manoeuvrings might affect the
seriousness with which the government took its 'more reasoned criticism'.

FT  27 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Portillo signals pay crackdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Portillo yesterday warned that the government would not break its
public expenditure targets, as he underlined the root and branch nature of
its departmental spending review.
As the finance bill implementing the measures in last month's Budget
received its second Commons reading, the chief secretary to the Treasury
also signalled a renewed crackdown on wages.
Sustaining Britain's competitive advantage would depend on controlling costs
'wage costs in particular', he said. Wage restraint would 'help business to
compete' and assist in the creation of new jobs.
In a combative speech, Mr Portillo sought to portray the government's battle
to control public spending as for the good of the whole economy. If public
spending was too high, it weighed upon the 'wealth-creating sector of our
country', he said.
Offering a coded warning to cabinet ministers as the new round of
public-spending discussions starts he predicted that the government's
spending would grow at a slower rate than overall growth in the economy over
time. He said the government had published fixed spending ceilings 'above
which we will not go.'
Seeking to buttress his argument with statistics, Mr Portillo said central
government debt interest payments were projected to rise by nearly 9 per
cent a year in real terms between now and 1996-97.
This alone would add close to 1 per cent to the proportion of national
income taken by public spending, which is planned to weigh in at over 45 per
cent in the current financial year.
Turning to his rolling four-year public spending review, Mr Portillo said he
had agreed 'demanding agendas' with the four cabinet ministers whose
big-spending departments had been initially targeted.
'We have chosen these programmes because they are among the largest - what
is loose change in these programmes can be more than the entire budget for
another department,' he said.
Ms Harriet Harman, a front-bench Labour Treasury spokesman, took the
government to task for breaking its pre-election pledges not to raise taxes,
while Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokesman, urged
ministers to remember that they meant 'we are climbing out of the hole into
which the government pushed us'.
The bill received a second reading by 310 votes to 266, a government
majority of 44.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday launched a publicity campaign to win support among
parents for the controversial national curriculum tests for schools in
England and Wales.
Launching the Pounds 700,000 campaign of national press ads and leaflets, Mr
John Patten, education secretary, said it would be a tragedy if this year's
tests did not go ahead.
Mr Peter Smith of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers said that
differences over testing could not be solved by a public relations campaign.

FT  27 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pressure over Jubilee line deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS have come under pressure from both Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs
over the question of government guarantee or underwriting as a result of the
deal by which the European Investment Bank agreed to provide Pounds 98m
towards the extension of the Jubilee line.
The EIB is a public sector institution owned by the European Community
member states, which usually lends to public sector projects underwritten by
governments.
Mr Steven Norris, the junior transport minister, said yesterday that the
detailed arrangements were still being discussed and were subject to
commercial confidentiality.
There were signs, however, that once the negotiations had been concluded
ministers would be more forthcoming about the arrangements between London
Transport, London Underground and the parties involved in financing Canary
Wharf which should allow the Jubilee line extension to go ahead.

FT  27 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont to lobby on unitary taxation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, will this week raise the stakes in the
long-running battle over California's system for taxing foreign companies by
raising the prospect of possible retaliatory action, David Owen and George
Graham write.
Mr Lamont will use a visit to Washington for a series of high-level meetings
to raise the matter with Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary.
The chancellor will be bearing the tough message that Britain's ultimate
sanction could be to invoke retaliatory clauses in bilateral double tax
treaties that would bar tax credits to the parent companies of US groups
with subsidiaries in the UK.
The move follows this week's decision by President Bill Clinton not to file
a brief in support of a suit brought by Barclays Bank against California's
worldwide unitary tax law.
It is widely felt the situation could produce the first confrontation over
the US's tough new approach to the taxation of foreign multinationals.
Although the Clinton administration has decided not to support Barclays'
suit, as previous US governments have done, the US Supreme Court would
probably require the White House to express its view if it heard the case.
Lawyers involved do not believe it is a foregone conclusion that the
administration would side with California.
However, California, which estimates it stands to lose Dollars 800m if the
decision goes against it, believes the administration is motivated by the
desire to ease its fiscal difficulties.

FT  27 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Challenge renewed on social chapter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS to ensure that MPs can have an effective vote on the social chapter
have already been renewed in advance of the next stage of the marathon
debate on the Maastricht treaty.
Both the Labour frontbench team and Mr Bill Cash, a leading Tory
Euro-sceptic, have re-tabled the amendment excluding the social protocol
from the bill ratifying the treaty.
While Labour MPs are concentrating on the social chapter, almost 60
amendments have been tabled so far by various Euro-sceptics on both sides of
the Commons.
Their determination not to relax their efforts has been fuelled by anger
over the comments of Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, who signalled
at the weekend that the UK intended to join other EC countries in closer
economic and political co-operation even if Denmark rejected Maastricht in
its referendum next month.
Last night, former Tory party chairman and prominent Euro-sceptic Lord
Tebbit said: 'If his (Mr Hurd's) words have any meaning they can mean only
that the pledge he gave at Edinburgh - the pledges of the prime minister,
too - were not matters of honour, just words to help get the Maastricht bill
through parliament.'

support for Britsh industry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night continued his campaign to persuade industry that
the government is now on its side with a commitment to establish more joint
public/private sector projects in Britain and to fight harder for its
interests in Europe, Philip Stephens writes.
In a speech to the Freight Transport Association the prime minister also
underlined his commitment to further deregulation to reduce the burdens on
business.
Welcoming the latest evidence from official GDP figures that recovery is
under way, Mr Major said that his priority was to ensure the upturn was
sustained.
Industry would have to take advantage of the opportunities offered by low
inflation and interest rates.
The government for its part was giving high priority to projects to improve
the nation's infrastructure. Where possible the government would ensure that
private companies provided the finance and expertise.

FT  27 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs refuse to let bombs set agenda
 -Westminster's reaction to Saturday's explosion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major's refusal to be provoked by the IRA's attack on the City
captured the mood of most MPs yesterday - and avoided the terrorists
triggering a debate over government policy on Northern Ireland.
Pressure for tougher security on the UK mainland was palpable at Westminster
yesterday - although there was no consensus on specific measures, beyond
greater vigilance.
But Conservative MPs and the Labour party were determined to avoid
'knee-jerk' reactions. 'Today in the City, it is business as usual,' the
prime minister told the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development.
Mr John Smith, Labour party leader, said: 'It has to be made absolutely
clear to the evil men of the IRA that . . . the nation as a whole will not
be intimidated or diverted from their normal course of action by bombing.'
There were no calls for a Commons' statement by the government. One loyalist
Tory MP said: 'We keep on. The road is seamless. There is no great
groundswell for a change of policy.'
Yet a Commons debate may have revealed Conservative tensions over government
thinking on Northern Ireland. Some Tories have joined Ulster Unionist MPs in
expressing fears that the government is drifting too close to a nationalist
agenda, encouraging the IRA to think it is making an impact.
'We need to make it quite plain that Ulster shall remain part of the UK and
stop constitutional mongering that panders to the US and the south of
Ireland,' said Mr Nicholas Budgen, Tory MP for Wolverhampton south-west.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, has said Britain has 'no
strategic interest' in Northern Ireland and that the province remains part
of the UK because a majority of its population wants to be. Last Friday he
ruled out a future political agreement in Northern Ireland that precluded
future unification.
Fresh protests from Ulster Unionists MPs came yesterday from comments by Sir
Patrick in a German magazine when he went further than intended in saying
Britain would 'very happily' release Northern Ireland if unification was
supported locally. The remark was withdrawn immediately.
However, it would be unfair to suggest that support for Northern Ireland's
Unionist parties is unbending within Tory ranks. Mr Budgen admits he is in a
minority: 'I don't think most of my colleagues have much of a view about
Ulster, to be honest.'
To an extent, there is indifference - few Tory MPs take a close interest in
Northern Ireland; relations with the Northern Ireland parties are not often
intimate. But there is also a consensus that, after nearly 25 years of
'troubles', Northern Ireland's problems have to be addressed through
political talks. Events such as those that occurred on Saturday have to be
divorced from that process.
'In spite of its murderous actions, the IRA does have a political rationale
and that is a united Ireland . . . Any reaction based on a political
solution is actually what the IRA wants to see happen,' said Mr Graham
Riddick, Tory MP for Colne Valley.
In practice, the successful resumption of political talks will depend on
local factors. The biggest obstacle may be the reaction of Ulster Unionists
to discussions between Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, and Mr John
Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party.

FT  27 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Teachers' plea on testing rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIX unions representing school teachers in England and Wales yesterday
united to urge Mr John Patten, the education secretary, to suspend the
controversial national curriculum tests for 1993, John Willman writes.
The unions called in a letter for the suspension of the tests pending the
review of the national curriculum and testing by Sir Ron Dearing,
newly-appointed chairman of the two government advisory bodies on school
education.
Mr Patten immediately dismissed the appeal as 'an extraordinary suggestion'.
He said it would lead to the scrapping of the tests for seven-year-olds, now
in their third year, in spite of 'overwhelming evidence that they are
helping push up standards'.
The appeal brought together the Professional Association of Teachers and the
two headteachers' unions with the National Association of
Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers which is boycotting the tests. These
were joined by the National Union of Teachers and the Association of
Teachers and Lecturers, both of which are balloting members over a boycott.
The appeal came as the government launched a Pounds 700,000 publicity
campaign to win support for the national curriculum tests for schools in
England and Wales.

FT  27 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories sidestep debate on water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE possible privatisation of Scotland's water and sewage services will not
be the subject of a separate debate at the Scottish Tories' annual
conference next month, in spite of being one of the country's main political
issues at present,
None of the seven motions on water submitted by party associations has been
chosen for debate and only one supports transferring the industry from
regional councils, which currently run it, to the private sector. Two
motions call for it to stay in public hands.
The future of the water industry will instead be discussed in the debate on
the reform of local government which begins the three-day conference in
Edinburgh on May 12. Eight cabinet ministers, including Mr Norman Lamont,
chancellor of the exchequer, will attend the conference, and Mr John Major,
the prime minister, will address the closing rally.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said yesterday he will announce his
decision on the water industry and on the new shape of local government
before parliament rises in July.
Mr Lang confirmed yesterday that privatisation had proved to be the least
popular option in the responses to the green paper. There have been
suggestions that he is likely to propose a form of franchising.

FT  27 APR 93 / Hard evidence of recovery eludes northern professionals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A PRIVATE dining room at Worsley Old Hall, Greater Manchester, an
informal luncheon club of a dozen members of various professions was
searching for tangible reasons to believe recovery is under way. Among these
people, who included lawyers, actuaries, accountants and consultants, faith
was in short supply.
A generally agreed perspective was provided by Mr Len Collinson, chairman of
Collinson Grant, a local management consultancy. He said: 'We have a number
of clients who are doing better, but it's against very bad results last year
and the year before. Things can only get better because they could hardly
have got worse, short of people going out of business.'
Times are tougher than they look in professional services, which experienced
remarkable growth in Manchester and Leeds during the latter half of the
1980s.
Professionals have been putting up a good front but Mr Graeme Jump, partner
in charge of the Manchester office of Mace &amp; Jones, said what many of his
fellow solicitors have kept quiet about.
'Three or four years ago, corporate lawyers used to boast about how much
they could charge for their time,' he said. 'They pushed prices up and
clients hardly ever protested. Not now. Prices are negotiable downwards.
Real fee levels are probably down 30 to 40 per cent on two years ago.'
Mr Jump added that job prospects are poor in corporate legal services: 'For
the first time since the 1960s there are trainees coming to the end of their
articles who are unable to find jobs.'
Mr Dennis Wright, a director of Reeves Brown Associates, a firm of
actuaries, echoed this: 'The very idea of an unemployed actuary used to be
unthinkable. Now there are very many.'
Nor are professional groups particularly buoyant on Humberside, where the
Humber's four large ports and myriad smaller wharves have been growing with
export trade to Europe during the recession.
Mr Roger King, a partner in Kidsons Impey accountants of Hull, told the
luncheon club last week: 'My clients say any recovery is extremely slow. In
the construction industry, it's non-existent. The accountancy profession is
suffering redundancies all over the country. There are many newly qualified
accountants who have completed their training but cannot be kept on.'
There are some hopeful signs, however. North West Business Insider, the
regional business magazine, has surveyed Manchester advertising agencies and
found this year's budgets were 25 per cent up on last year. Corporate
finance activity was also up as medium-sized companies turned to
professionals in this field for advice on how to prepare themselves for
economic recovery.

FT  27 APR 93 / IoD sees surge in business confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP improvement in business confidence and activity was reported
yesterday by the Institute of Directors, adding to evidence that the economy
is climbing out of recession.
Mr Peter Morgan, the institute's director-general, said the latest
two-monthly survey shows business confidence at its highest level for nearly
five years with 64 per cent of directors more optimistic about their
company's prospects.
Mr Morgan emphasised that the upsurge in confidence was accompanied by a
rise in output, orders and profits.
Predicting a 'brisk' improvement in economic activity, he added: 'When
business confidence and performance are marching together, we have a sound
base for sustained economic recovery. But it would be wrong to suppose the
economy is back to the levels of 1988. It is only a start to the end of a
very deep recession and there is a long way to go.'
Mr Morgan said that, because of extensive spare capacity, the UK economy was
in a position to sustain an annual growth rate of between 3 per cent and 4
per cent, although that was not likely during 1993.
He said the challenge was to ensure 'steady, organic growth which avoids the
vast booms and terrible slumps of the past'. Public-sector spending and pay
had to be kept under tight control to avoid another inflationary burst.
The survey - conducted among more than 300 members of the institute in the
first three weeks of April - shows that only 9 per cent of directors are
less optimistic about their own company's prospects.
The upturn is, according to the institute, being experienced throughout the
regions - with the south-east coming through strongly. Nearly three quarters
of respondents say their business is doing well. Order books are improving
significantly, profits are rising and business volumes are also increasing.
However, most directors report no significant change in employment
prospects, although a third say they expect some improvement in employment
levels within their businesses in the next six months.
Investment continues to stagnate, with just over half of the companies
taking part reporting no increase in spending. The institute says sluggish
investment reflects under-capacity and that spending should rise as recovery
takes a hold.
The survey puts cashflow at the top of companies' present concerns, and Mr
Morgan yesterday asked banks to show understanding as businesses coped with
the pressures faced when coming out of recession.

FT  27 APR 93 / Rise in start-ups reverses trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL business start-ups increased in the first three months of this year,
the first rise since the third quarter of 1991, says National Westminster
Bank.
A total of 95,000 new businesses began trading in the first quarter, an
increase of 6 per cent on the final quarter of last year.
This figure is still well below the quarterly number of start-ups in 1991
and early 1992 but it does mark the first signs of recovery within a
significant sector of the economy and the labour market, the bank said. On
average each new small business creates 1 1/2 jobs excluding the proprietor.
The first quarter traditionally shows an improvement on the preceding final
quarter. However, if forecasts for recovery in demand, output and consumer
spending prove correct, the growth in business formation should be
sustained, said Mrs Jane Bradford, head of NatWest small-business services.
A total of 400,000 new businesses started last year, NatWest said. The bank,
which claims 31 per cent of the small-business market, bases its figures on
the new business accounts that are opened at its branches.

FT  27 APR 93 / Buy-out fund launched for public sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE venture-capital groups are joining forces to provide Pounds 100m of
investment for management buy-outs by government agencies and other
public-service organisations.
Electra Kingsway, Schroder Venture Advisers and ECI Ventures have launched
the initiative with Capita Corporate Finance, a subsidiary of the
fast-growing Capita Group.
Capita - which started as a buy-out from the Chartered Institute of Public
Finance and Accountancy - will assist managers preparing their businesses
for privatisation, providing commercial advice and developing corporate
plans and financial packages.
The consortium expects an increasing number of buy-outs to follow last
November's Citizen's Charter report which promised further privatisation. It
is already retained in three current buy-out proposals.
Among likely candidates for buy-outs are undertakings such as municipal bus
companies, ports, airports and parts of British Rail once privatisation
begins.
Several of the 80 government agencies are also to be put up for sale as part
of the market-testing policy, including DVOIT, the information technology
wing of the Department of Transport, and Companies House. Other agencies
will also be considered for privatisation every three years as their
framework documents come up for renewal.
The joint venture will back bids for such businesses by the management team,
drawing on Capita's experience in public-sector buy-outs in local government
and public utilities.
Mr Clive Ward, managing director of Capita Corporate Finance, said: 'The
major ingredients for successful management buy-outs already exist in many
public-sector activities - strong management teams and secure, thriving
businesses with good opportunities for growth outside the public sector.'
Capita has advised in more than half the buy-outs in local government,
including MRS Environmental Services, the management and employee buy-out of
Westminster City Council's street cleaning and refuse collection operation.
Capita also advised in the buy-out of London Coaches, the sightseeing
division of London Buses and its first subsidiary to be privatised, as well
as the Pounds 71m management and employee buy-out of West Midlands Travel.
The three venture-capital groups together manage or advise funds of more
than Pounds 1bn in the UK.

FT  27 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Offers from rivals ease space scramble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SEARCH for new offices to house the estimated 20,000 workers who have
been displaced was helped by offers from suppliers, subsidiaries, and even
rivals.
The British Bankers' Association said it had been contacted by members with
offers to give space in their facilities to other banks and institutions
affected by the blast.
Daewoo Securities, the Korean securities company, moved its 10 staff into
the offices of Coryo International, another Korean company, on London Wall.
Bessemer Trust, which occupies 76 Bishopsgate, has moved its 11 staff into
Kleinwort Benson's offices.
The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan has called on help from Mitsubishi Bank -
'a friendly competitor' - to accommodate its London branch and Dai-Ichi
Europe - 'a very close friend' - to accommodate its international branch.
Its computer operation is being accommodated in Digital Equipment Company's
Tottenham Court Road offices.
Surveyors said that the relocation of the occupiers of an estimated 1m sq ft
of damaged offices has gone relatively smoothly. 'Compared with last year's
explosion outside the Baltic Exchange, the City is better equipped to
respond, as many large organisations developed disaster recovery plans for
this kind of emergency,' said Mr Robert Calnan of Jones Lang Wootton.
The well-laid contingency plans and the glut of empty offices in the City
meant that few tenants felt obliged to scramble to find new offices. 'People
are not taking swift decisions about the long-term occupation of space,'
said Mr Nigel Grice of Drivers Jonas, chartered surveyors.
The recession, which has left many companies with surplus space within their
own buildings, allowed many to relocate displaced staff in their premises.
'It's been a matter of a judicious use of a shoehorn,' said Willis Corroon,
the insurance broker, which has relocated the 500 people who worked in 1
Camomile Street within other buildings in the group.
National Westminster Bank and the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation,
the two companies that were most affected by the bomb, were able to relocate
staff within their existing offices.
About 300 of Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's 600 staff were
back at work yesterday in two other buildings owned by the bank's parent
company HSBC Holdings in Lower Thames Street.
The Bank of Scotland, which had three of its offices in the City damaged by
the blast, has moved staff temporarily from its chief office in Threadneedle
Street and another in Old Broad Street to a third in Bishopsgate.
Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett, a US firm of solicitors at 99 Bishopsgate was
assessing bomb damage to its offices for the second time in a year. 'This
time the damage is more comprehensive,' said Mr Rhett Brandon, a partner.
'But as long as London is a main financial centre, we have to be here.'

FT  27 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Damage insurer assesses itself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTTLES OF Evian water, briefcases, jackets and nine worried executives were
cluttering up the office of Mr Guy Belcher, managing director of Richard
Sparrow, a London firm of reinsurance brokers yesterday.
Mr Belcher himself was sitting outside with his secretaries and other
colleagues as the directors of Macey Williams, a Lloyd's insurance broker
that had been bombed out, scoured the City for somewhere to do their
business for the next six months.
Among other parts of the business, Macey Williams provides insurance cover
for bomb damage to property companies. This time it found itself on the
receiving end. It is based in St Helen's Place close to the heart of
Saturday's City bomb blast.
Mr Roger Macey, the managing director, began drawing up emergency plans on
Saturday evening but it wasn't until yesterday that someone managed to
inspect the damage.
He said the company had been offered one office at Pounds 75 per sq ft which
he said was 'far too high'. Other rentals were close to Pounds 20 per sq ft
not far from the Pounds 18 which the company had been paying.
Directors came in and out throughout the afternoon to report on
possibilities. One site seemed ideal at 3,000 sq ft but had no telephone
points. 'We'll keep trying until we find somewhere, but we will,' said Mr
Macey. Mr Belcher said: 'If they don't get anywhere then they'll have my
office again tomorrow. That's how the Lloyd's community helps each other.'
Other executives were visiting the bombed premises, getting past police
barriers by wearing white hard hats and using side entrances. The company,
Mr Macey said, needed to get its files, fax machines and other equipment out
but he did not know at that stage whether a removal lorry would be granted
access.
He said the company had been unable to write much business but had still
managed to take two orders. 'We shall need our Macey Williams paper slips to
go to Lloyd's so that will mean another sortie tomorrow,' he said.

FT  27 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Fears on future location of European
central bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OUR FOREIGN STAFF
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SIR William Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the parent of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank - warned yesterday that the IRA's
weekend bomb blast could undermine London's chances of being chosen as the
home for the future European central bank.
London is one of the cities vying to be home for a future European central
bank when monetary union is achieved.
Expressing concern at the damage caused by the explosion, Sir William said:
'I would have thought when Europe is deciding where its central bank is
going to be, which may not be imminent, security and transport are
difficulties which are going to count against London when many other things
should be favouring London.'
However, Sir William said London would remain a leading financial centre and
is still the favoured home city for the Hongkong Bank's parent company,
which is moving its headquarters to London after buying Midland Bank for
Pounds 3.9bn last year.
Mr Claus-Werner Bertram, managing director of Deutsche Bank AG, said the
blast would not deter international financiers. 'There is not even a
discussion about it. We have to be in this city. There is no question of us
moving out.'
Relocating from the Square Mile - the heart of the financial district - to
another business centre such as Canary Wharf in London's redeveloped
Docklands area, was no solution, Mr Bertram said. He said the bombers would
just follow.
In Zurich officials at Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) and Swiss Bank
Corporation (SBC) underlined their commitment to London.
In the US Mr Richard Fisher, chairman of Morgan Stanley, said: 'It's
obviously a tragedy and a matter of great concern. But I don't believe it
will have any impact on the importance of London as a financial centre.'
Mr Bernard Poignant, director of BNP Capital Markets in London, and a board
member of BNP France, said: 'If the risks increase we will increase our
security.' He added that to pull out would just encourage terrorism.
Mr Richard Spiegelberg, Merrill Lynch Europe's director of corporate
communications, said: 'There is so much going for London as a financial
centre. It will take more than a couple of bombs to shake that commitment.'

FT  27 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Japanese banks undeterred by damage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE banks in London yesterday said they would not be deterred from
doing business in the City as a result of the weekend bomb, despite severe
damage to the offices of two leading Japanese institutions.
Tokai Bank, the largest in Japan, had four floors in the Hongkong and
Shanghai Bank tower, one of the buildings most severely damaged in the
blast.
'London is an international finance centre and doing business there is
necessary,' Tokai said. 'The bomb doesn't damage that image, but the risk is
increasing. We will have to consider how to reduce the risks for our
operations.'
The Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, one of a small group of long-term
financing institutions, was also forced out by the bomb, and has moved into
temporary accommodation with two other Japanese banks, Mitsubishi and Daichi
Europe.
Other Japanese institutions hit by the two City bombs over the last year
include Mitsubishi Corporation Finance, the financing arm of the Mitsubishi
trading group, whose office was devastated over the weekend, and Sanwa Bank,
which was forced out of offices in the Commercial Union building last year.
The general reaction from Japanese financial institutions was that they must
maintain a presence in London regardless of the risk. But the blast comes as
many of these institutions, still troubled by bad loans at home, are
reviewing or trimming international operations.
Japanese securities houses have cut expatriate staff in London as part of
general shifting of resources out of Europe to take advantage of higher
growth in Asia. A brokerage official said terrorism in London was one more
reason to send fewer Japanese expatriate staff, but would not of itself
prompt the company to bring staff home.
'Japanese know that the IRA has exploded bombs in the past, but the attacks
on the City give us a different feeling. We wonder why they are attacking
financial targets, and it does make us feel a bit uneasy,' the broker said.
The Bank of Tokyo ordered a security assessment before a recent move to new
London premises, which were unaffected by the explosion. The latest incident
appears to have confirmed the wisdom of the assessment.
Mitsubishi Bank will review the security of its offices in London, which
were not damaged. Sumitomo Bank, another leading Japanese institution, said:
'We are gathering information and will consider what action should be
taken.'

FT  27 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Loss assessors see little that can be
salvaged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATER poured through the ceiling of a wrecked sandwich shop, 50 yards from
the crater caused by Saturday's bomb blast. Mr Justin Balcombe, of loss
assessors Balcombe Group, wanders over, treading carefully through twisted
metal window fittings, rubble and fragments of glass littering Bishopsgate.
'It's not the water main. It's a sprinkler that's gone off,' he says, noting
the details carefully. This could be useful information for a claim.
With his colleague Mr John Gale, the group's deputy managing director, Mr
Balcombe has been examining damage since early yesterday, sometimes
following up inquiries from anxious shop owners and businessmen, who are
still denied access to the area, sometimes - as in this case - simply
collecting information.
Saturday's attack has brought a flood of inquiries to Balcombe Group, which
advises companies on insurance coverage and claims. Both men are convinced
that the loss will be greater than that caused by the Baltic Exchange bomb
last year, and insist that total claims will exceed Pounds 1bn.
They believe structural damage to be far heavier than in last year's bomb.
'If this building is not pulled down it will be a miracle,' says Mr Gale,
pointing to an office building beside the remnants of St Ethelburga's
church.
Balcombe's preliminary assessments of half a dozen properties have shown
that very little is salvageable. Claims for lighting and other office
furniture and fittings will also mount up into hefty sums. In the buildings
closest to the blast daggers of glass still hang uneasily from the windows.
Removing glass and securing buildings will take at least a further week.
The firm expects claims for interruption to business - what insurers call
B/I - to swell the size of the total loss. B/I accounted for about a third
of the Pounds 300m of damage caused by last April's bombs.
Demolition work will inevitably mean curbs on access to the area even after
workers return, reducing customers and hindering suppliers. 'Restriction of
access will be covered under some insurance policies,' says Mr Balcombe.
Damage to telecommunications links and gas, electricity and water supplies
will slow construction work. 'It is going to take months to reroute them,'
he adds.
At the wrecked Bishopsgate branch of Pret a Manger, the takeaway food chain,
Mr Sinclair Beecham, the chain's owner, has asked Balcombe to help with an
overall claim for several hundred thousand pounds, of which B/I will amount
to over half.
Wearing an unfamiliar hard hat, he surveys staff cleaning up broken glass
and predicts it could be months before the shop will open again. 'There are
no customers out there. There will be no one out there for a while.'

FT  27 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Business as usual but City workers are
apprehensive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Francis McWilliams, Lord Mayor of London, had an indifferent reception
from commuters at Liverpool Street station as British Rail officials handed
out 20,000 maps of the no-go area.
The Lord Mayor's upbeat message was that it was business as usual but some
workers were apprehensive about going back to their jobs.
Mrs Barbara Hollis, 41, a switchboard operator for NatWest who is based in
Broadgate, said: 'For the first time I am questioning working here. It's the
NatWest Tower. I've got friends over there. I just think everyone feels the
same - frightened.'
Ms Michele Mumford, 25, an accounts manager for the Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority, said: 'It has put me off working in the City. The bombers have
made so many hiccups so far, there's no guarantee they might not accidently
set one off when there's thousands of people about.
Mr Peter Davies, 56, managing director of Priceware, a financial information
company in Staple Hall, Stonehouse Court, said his company, a start-up
operation, had been due to open for business today.
'We were going live today. It doesn't look very like it now.'
Police were allowing some workers into premises at the periphery of the
cordonned-off area. Most key holders in the worst-hit areas were arranging
passes but some sneaked through unofficially to make quick damage
assessments.
Businesses away from the heart of the blast were sweeping up glass in an
attempt to open as soon as possible. Balls Brothers at the corner of
Liverpool Street and Bishopsgate lost much of its wine but the manager, Mr
Chris Atkins, said: 'Most of the best stuff seems to have survived.'
The Suit Company, part of Moss Brothers, displayed signs offering
bomb-damaged stock at up to 75 per cent off. Assistant manager Mr Peter Opie
said: 'It's in the best Moss Bros tradition. We have brushed ourselves down
and gone for it in the best way we can.'
Mr John Emin, 22, an accounts manager at the Royal Bank of Scotland's
premises on Threadneedle Street, spent the weekend at home in Braintree,
Essex and had heard nothing from his company: 'I think the bomb was
disgusting. I don't know if I'm outraged, it's more disbelief.'

FT  27 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Search for greater security gets under way
/ A look at the questions the City must answer if it is to strengthen its
protection against further terrorist attacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHOULD there be more police on the streets to enforce parking restrictions
and check on suspicious vehicles?
Following the bomb attack last year in St Mary Axe, the Corporation of
London increased the number of police officers by 40 at a cost of Pounds
1.5m. The extra cost was borne mainly by the big financial institutions
which bear the burden of the corporation's Pounds 700m annual budget.
The corporation likes to claim that a bomb discovered in Stoke Newington,
north of the City, before last year's Lord Mayor's Show, did not end up
being left in the City as a result of the heavy police presence. But this
alone cannot stop bomb attacks - and didn't last weekend. In Northern
Ireland, a large police presence and additional troops have not prevented
bomb attacks. Should there be more regular checks on vehicles which are
circulating in London?
The police would like to carry out more checks at irregular intervals in
order to wrongfoot potential terrorists. They are seeking more powers to do
so but feel that their powers of detention on suspicion are restrained under
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. There is a specific restriction
against the police setting up permanent road blocks to check vehicles. The
police themselves worry about the potential of turning areas of the mainland
into new versions of Ulster, which would be considered a victory by the IRA.
Are there other ways of regulating traffic flow in the City?
Three streets in the City have been turned into pedestrian precincts, and
plans to pedestrianise other areas are likely to be hastened. Some back
streets have already been closed off since last year's bomb - Throgmorton
Street, for instance, which runs behind the Stock Exchange and the Bank of
England. This, and moves to discourage the use of private cars, could lead
to a concentration of commercial vehicles on to main thoroughfares, reducing
the areas that need to be policed.
Are the City's buildings adequately protected against bomb blasts?
Short of rebuilding offices with reinforced concrete of the kind that might
be used in a nuclear fall-out shelter, no material is available that can
protect a building which is next to a bomb blast.
Some City buildings gain some protection through the use of laminated glass
with special frames, plastic film on windows or protective curtains, or
mobile laminated fibreglass mat screens. These can minimise the risk of
injury by flying glass by about 95 per cent and reduce the potential damage
to equipment.
The costs involved could be reduced if additional security were built in at
an early construction phase rather than as a replacement.
To fit out a 30ft by 20ft reception area in a City office with laminated
glass can cost about Pounds 750,000.
Is there adequate co-ordination of security strategies between the police
and businesses operating in the City?
Some security advisers think not. The problem is that companies tend to
devise their own security policies without co-ordinating with each other and
do not have serious forward planning on the issue. The corporation says that
some businesses did get together with their neighbours to co-ordinate their
security after last year's bomb, although it has not attempted to
co-ordinate or encourage such action. Could private businesses be doing more
to guard against terrorist acts?
Police say yes - increased vigilance by company security staff, and better
co-ordination with police. At least one large commercial establishment has
been working closely with its private security advisers to monitor vehicles.
Would increased use of video cameras help?
Videos, together with additional technology capable of enhancing wide-angle
images, can be used to provide evidence on the culprits of a bomb but do not
necessarily guarantee prevention. There are about two dozen cameras in use
to monitor traffic on the City's main streets, although few of these are
linked to video recorders. The corporation said it would consider extending
the use of cameras.
Is the City more vulnerable than other financial centres?
It is, not so much because it is less protected, but because the IRA is
better organised and better resourced than any other terrorist organisation.
Terrorist attacks on the European mainland are not on the scale they were in
the 1970s and rarely involve destruction of property.
Nonetheless in Frankfurt the Bundesbank has barriers supervised by armed
police while businesspeople and bankers are known to be protected by
personal bodyguards. Some senior executives use private lifts and work in
offices without windows. In New York co-ordination of anti-terrorist
policing under the FBI did not prevent the recent bomb at the World Trade
Center. One of the main criticisms launched at anti-terrorism measures in
the UK is that the security forces are too fragmented.

FT  27 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Safety net catches displaced dealers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WE HADN'T planned to test things out so soon,' says Mr Philip Lovell,
general manager of Safetynet Trading Places, an emergency computer back-up
facility on the fringes of the City.
Workmen are carrying in fax machines and paper. A photocopier has been
delivered. Engineers are installing telephones.
Trading Places - which has the capacity for three small City dealing rooms
and back-up operations - opened last Wednesday after three months of fitting
out.
Eight dealers and a dozen support staff from Tokai Bank were working in the
centre from first thing yesterday. Another room was being kitted out for use
by an unnamed bank.
Mr Lovell says the blast has provided 40 per cent of the company's annual
budgeted revenues. 'From a business point of view it has been good, though
we hadn't planned it to come as a result of this awful event,' he says. Most
use of the rooms results from more mundane events  - such as floods and
engineering failures.
Mr Hamid Noorizadeh, assistant general manager at Tokai Bank - based at the
now devastated Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank building at 99 Bishopsgate - said he
heard of the bombing on Saturday morning, but that contingency plans had
been laid last year.
'We haven't lost anything,' he says. 'We were able to retrieve all our
accounting and treasury data from back-up computer information stored
off-site. But we cannot trade as actively as we would have.'

FT  27 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Call to rethink terrorism insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARRANGEMENTS to insure against terrorism damage are unworkable in the wake
of Saturday's bomb damage, commercial insurance buyers claimed yesterday.
The Association of Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce
(Airmic), which represents more than 300 UK insurance buyers, said a
compulsory levy should be attached to all commercial insurance policies.
Failure to introduce a levy could lead to much higher premiums for
businesses based in the City and other high-risk areas. 'Companies should
not be penalised by high premiums for being based in the City,' said Ms Liz
Taylor, who chairs Airmic. 'All UK businesses should contribute something .
. . to what is a national problem.'
Insurers withdrew terrorism cover from standard commercial policies last
year. Under new arrangements negotiated with the government last year,
businesses can 'buy back' terrorism insurance. These additional premiums are
channelled into Pool Re, a specially created reinsurance company which is
reinsured by the government. However, losses of at least Pounds 300m from
Saturday's bomb will almost certainly exhaust Pool Re funds.
Mr Tony Baker, public relations manager of the Association of British
Insurers, said yesterday that Pool Re was likely to re-examine its rating
structure and could increase premiums for businesses in vulnerable areas.
Airmic believes that even fewer companies will then buy cover from Pool Re.
'There is a natural reluctance for people in industries that are not
vulnerable to buy the cover,' said Mr Geoff Saunders, a member of the Airmic
council.
The DTI said yesterday that questions regarding the viability of Pool Re
should be addressed to insurers, but the ABI insisted that a levy was
'unrealistic'.
A compulsory levy was turned down by the government during negotiations to
set up Pool Re last year.

FT  27 APR 93 / Travel industry attacks government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is likely to face legal action over its failure to provide
package holiday travellers with the protection required by a European
Community directive, Mr Mike Grindrod, president of the Association of
British Travel Agents, said yesterday.
He told an association convention in Majorca that package tour regulations
which came into force at the beginning of the year were an 'un-satisfactory
mishmash'.
The directive requires all companies to have bonding or insurance
arrangements to ensure customers can be re-patriated or receive their money
back in the event of corporate collapse. Mr Grindrod criticised the
government for allowing companies to make their own arrangements outside
recognised trade organisations.
If a failed travel operator had insufficient insurance, travellers would
merely have the consolation of knowing that the company faced a fine. They
would have no means of getting their money back.
Mr Grindrod said: 'Lewis Carroll at his most imaginative could never have
invented anything as topsy-turvy and through a cracked looking glass as Her
Majesty's government has concocted.
'Eventually I am convinced that a future British government, either
voluntarily as a matter of policy or having been hauled kicking and
screaming before the European court, will amend the regulations to provide a
statutory guarantee.'

FT  27 APR 93 / Millions lack basic skills for jobs

about 6m people - has serious literacy and numeracy problems and face
difficulties with filling in forms or giving change, says the
government-funded Adult Literacy and Basic Skills Unit.
Most are in work but the unit's survey concludes that the range and number
of jobs open to them is shrinking.
The survey, one of the most extensive on basic skills, was carried out in 73
of the 82 Training and Enterprise Councils. It encompassed 24,000 employers,
covering 1.3m lower-level jobs.
Only half the employers surveyed said their workforces generally had good
basic skills.
Mr Alan Wells, director of the unit, warned that people with poor skills
faced intense competition from people with better skills - even for the
decreasing number of jobs that did not require much competence in basic
skills.
He said there was no single reason why people had difficulties with basic
skills.
Some had missed long periods of schooling, others had physical problems such
as undiagnosed hearing or sight loss, some had not been well-taught or some
did not have English as their mother tongue and were not educated in the UK.

FT  27 APR 93 / 'For sale' boards go up at mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR SALE OR LEASE: 20 coal mines, many loss-making and none wanted by their
owner. Required to compete in a fast-shrinking market of uncertain size.
Not perhaps the most tempting of public-sector assets to be offered to the
private sector, but enough to have already attracted the attention of 22
companies which have expressed an interest to British Coal.
In a month or so British Coal is likely to start advertising the first of
the pits it is closing or mothballing for sale or lease.
It will be another three or four months at least before the first of the
companies takes control of a pit.
The timetable must seem grindingly slow to companies such as RJB Mining and
Edwards Energy, which are among the frontrunners.
The apparent tardiness of the process has already been criticised by MPs.
However, Mr Neil Clarke, the British Coal chairman, says that the
corporation is moving as fast as possible.
'The principle is established: it is reasonable that if we have decided to
close a colliery, we should make it available to someone else,' he said
yesterday.
He described the process as 'enormously complicated'. The corporation must
take account of consultations with unions, competition law, the 1947
Nationalisation Act and the Transfer of Undertakings regulations of the
European Community.
There has been opposition by unions to the proposal by British Coal to
consult on the closure of all 10 pits collectively. This particular issue is
likely to be settled in the High Court.
Only when the closure procedure for each pit is over will British Coal start
the hiving-off process. Newspaper advertisements will invite expressions of
interest, which will entitle a bidder to detailed information on a colliery
and a chance to visit it.
Shortly after that it will become clear which bidders are serious.
Mr Ray Proctor, the British Coal executive heading the operation, said the
corporation intended to operate a competitive open-tender system, with a
'pre-qualifying process'.
He said: 'It will not be like sending off your application for a driving
licence and getting it back within a few days. Success will not just depend
on the level of someone's bid. We will be checking out the financial and
technical competence of bidders.'
British Coal is unlikely to look favourably upon companies intent on 'rape
and pillage' operations - mining easily accessible coal but doing no
development work.
'We do not want short-term bursts of output that will displace the coal of
collieries with long-term prospects,' said Mr Proctor.
The corporation will use consultants to help assess bidders and, said Mr
Clark, to ensure that licensing is 'judicial rather than arbitrary'.
Bidders will have to think long and hard before buying - the pits are being
discarded by British Coal because there is apparently nowhere to sell their
output. Nor will the size of the potential market become apparent until
British Coal concludes contracts for additional tonnages with the
electricity generators. That might not be achieved before October.
Most independent operators expect to concentrate on niche markets.
'We are running a system that is geared to the electricity supply industry
but gives some output for the domestic and industrial markets,' says Mr
Proctor. 'They (the independents) are seeking to reverse that logic, with
coal for electricity being the residual product.'
Independent analysts believe opportunities are limited. 'I would be
surprised if half a dozen of the 20 were licensed off,' said one yesterday.
'Even that is optimistic.'

FT  27 APR 93 / Auditors are told to provide more details of work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUDITORS will be required to provide more detailed documentation of their
work under draft guidelines issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
Five new auditing standards call for formal documentation throughout the
audit process, and add new guidelines on making estimates.
Mr David Young, a member of the board, said: 'This represents a hardening of
emphasis on particular points. I think it will make a difference through
lots of minor individual changes.'
The guidelines reflect concerns by audit regulators that auditors do not
have adequate information on paper which can be inspected to determine the
quality of their work.
A standard on planning stresses more emphasis on documentation and a
distinction between formulating general strategy and detailed planning of
procedures.
One on documentation says there should be evidence that the audit was
carried out in accordance with auditing standards, and which gives detailed
information of the content of working papers during the audit.
A standard on estimates stresses the importance of the auditors verifying
with sufficient evidence the larger number of accounting estimates during an
audit.
Comments on the guidelines are invited by July 31.
The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy yesterday unveiled
a new corporate image and announced fundamental changes to professional
qualifications.
New students will use open learning rather than being required to attend
college, making the qualification more flexible. Continuous assessment of
students' performance will assume a greater role. Greater emphasis is to be
placed on commercial accounting and reporting, taxation and business
planning.
Cipfa is also emphasising post-qualification development, and will shortly
launch an advanced diploma in business and financial management and a public
service Master of Business Administration degree.
The restructuring comes as Cipfa - which has about 11,500 members - faces
new challenges with the fundamental changes affecting the public sector.
Mr Noel Hepworth, director of the institute, said: 'Our objective is to
ensure that our qualifications and training remain relevant to the new
environment.'
The organisation has been given a new logo - the abbreviation Cipfa, with an
italic sweep to the letter p. It now calls itself 'the leading accountancy
body for the public services'.

FT  27 APR 93 / Daf Vans sets turnover goal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEYLAND Daf Vans expects to achieve a turnover of about Pounds 150m in its
first year of operation, Mr Allan Amey, chief executive, said yesterday.
The company, which was acquired at the weekend through a management buy-out
from the Leyland Daf administrative receivers, is forecasting annual output
of about 12,000 vehicles compared with 20,099 last year. Mr Amey said the
contraction of the van operations and the shedding of more than half of its
workforce in receivership had reduced its break-even level to an output of
less than 10,000 vans a year.
The venture capital group 3i said yesterday that it had provided about
Pounds 6.5m of equity finance for the buy-out with an additional Pounds
500,000 coming from management and employees. It emerged yesterday that the
buy-out plan had run into serious difficulties last week, when at a late
stage Lloyds Development Capital withdrew its offer to provide Pounds 1.5m
in equity to the venture.
The Lloyds share was provided by 3i, which plans to seek other partners to
share part of its present risk.
The other main elements of the Leyland Daf Vans financial package include:
Working capital and a medium-term bank loan of more than Pounds 7m provided
by Royal Bank of Scotland.
Financing of up to Pounds 20m from United Dominions Trust, a subsidiary of
TSB Bank. UK state aid of Pounds 9m. The Department of Trade and Industry is
making regional selective assistance grants of Pounds 5m, while the
Department of the Environment has funded the Pounds 4m purchase by the
Birmingham Heartlands Development Corporation of 42 acres of surplus land at
the van plant site.

FT  27 APR 93 / Du Cann paid by failed company
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER Tory minister Sir Edward Du Cann was paid Pounds 9,000 as
vice-chairman of Homes Assured when the mortgage broking company was
insolvent, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday.
A further Pounds 416,000 went to other Homes Assured directors, members of
their families and companies associated with them at a time when the company
was trading fraudulently, the court was told. It collapsed in August 1989
with debts of over Pounds 9m.
Mr Michael Kalisher QC, prosecuting, said Sir Edward, a non-executive
director for much of the company's 19-month life, was not concerned with its
day-to-day running, but played an active role in raising finance for the
company and negotiating with insurance companies.
Homes Assured directors Mr Anthony Dobson, Mr Michael Robinson and Keith
Woodward all deny a joint charge of fraudulent trading. Mr Dobson also
denies two charges of procuring the execution of a valuable security by
deception and Woodward one charge of furnishing false information.
The trial continues today.

FT  27 APR 93 / Photos on bank cards cut fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXPERIMENT in etching photographs and signatures on cheque guarantee
cards cut fraud by nearly 99 per cent, the Royal Bank of Scotland said
yesterday, John Gapper writes.
The bank, which has 1m customers, said it intended to be the first British
bank to offer them all the chance to have photographs on cards.
The laser etching of photographs and signatures on the reverse of the bank's
Highline cheque guarantee, cash dispenser and debit cards costs about Pounds
1.20 per card - about three times the cost of conventional cards.
The bank said an experiment covering 30,000 customers in 39 branches over
the past 18 months had reduced the anticipated level of fraud from about
Pounds 45,000 to three cases involving a total loss of Pounds 494.
The bank said it would not charge for such cards - though it charged
customers Pounds 2 per card in the pilot scheme. It believed it could
increase its gain by lowering the processing costs per card.
TSB has been testing putting photographs on customers' credit cards through
thermal imaging - a method adopted nationally by the National &amp; Provincial
Building society.
Mr Alex Barr, Royal Bank's card services development manager, said it was
also considering trying to put photographs on its credit cards. It would
have to negotiate this with First Data Resources, which makes its credit
cards.

FT  27 APR 93 / Unitised policies questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTUARIES HAVE expressed concern about the adequacy of reserves guaranteeing
the returns on certain life companies' unitised 'with-profits' policies.
A working party set up in 1991 by the actuarial professional bodies in
England and Scotland has confirmed that life assurance companies have been
rapidly switching 'with- profits' business to the unitised form first
introduced in the mid-1980s.
The working party's survey of 29 'mainstream' with-profits offices found
unitised with-profits reserves at the end of 1991 totalling Pounds 17.4bn -
21 per cent of all with-profits reserves.
The actuaries welcome the retention by the life offices of the right to
impose a 'market value adjuster' - a unit price reduction - in unusually
adverse investment conditions. But adjusters can prove controversial for
investors, who have little guidance on when they will be applied or how
large they might be.
Half the offices have imposed adjusters at some time on surrender of
policies, but not necessarily across the board; most appear to regard them
as a last resort. Half the companies have restrictions on their application,
and most offer guaranteed minimum annual returns. The working party says
some of these guarantees now look 'rather onerous'.

FT  27 APR 93 / BBC to give Birt large pay rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN BIRT has negotiated a large pay rise to take over as
director-general of the BBC.
Mr Birt is to be paid more than Pounds 185,000 a year. This compares with
Pounds 140,000 paid to his predecessor Sir Michael Checkland, who left the
corporation last year.
The increase comes two months after a row developed concerning Mr Birt's pay
while he was the corporation's deputy director-general.
For six years in the post Mr Birt was not on the staff of the corporation
but was paid as a freelance consultant through his private company, John
Birt Productions.
Mr Birt announced his intention to join the staff of the corporation on
March 1. Since then he has not been paid through his private company and has
been taxed on a Pay As You Earn basis. He has not, however, formally signed
a BBC staff contract yet.
The increase will more than compensate Mr Birt for the loss of tax
advantages he enjoyed as a consultant. Accountants Ernst &amp; Young looked at
the accounts of John Birt Productions for 1991 and found that his family
saved Pounds 3,935 in tax in 1991 - Pounds 810 after deducting accountancy
and administration charges.
The director-general's salary is set by a remuneration committee of the BBC
governors.
During the freelance dispute Sir Michael Checkland argued that Mr Birt's
position should be reviewed in 12 months, but that Mr Marmaduke Hussey, BBC
chairman, should resign.

FT  27 APR 93 / Radiation safety limits tightened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER LIMITS for the level of radiation that workers and the public can be
exposed to are fixed today in a comprehensive set of standards from the
National Radiological Protection Board.
The guidelines are a response to revised estimates of fatal cancer cases
among survivors of the two atomic bombs dropped on Japan in 1945. These
showed that radiation risks were two to three times higher than previously
believed.
The recommendations are expected to make most impact on medical X-rays, the
main source of man-made radiation exposure. Mr Geoffrey Webb, the board's
secretary, says his target is to reduce average radiation doses by half over
the next few years by persuading hospitals to avoid unnecessary X-rays and
to reduce the level of each exposure.
The guidelines provide a basis for new UK and European Community regulations
to control radiation exposure. The maximum permitted annual dose is cut from
50 to 20 millisieverts for a worker and from five to one millisievert for
the public.
UK industry already complies with the new guidelines 'with very few
exceptions', said Mr Webb.
The Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant in Cumbria 'should be able to
comply, although it comes pretty close to the new limits,' he said.

FT  27 APR 93 / Ex-chief of Bestwood took funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TONY COLE, former chairman and chief executive of Bestwood, the collapsed
finance and property mini-conglomerate, yesterday pleaded guilty to
misappropriating company funds.
The eight charges include perjury, false accounting, authorising loans
contrary to the Companies Act and making a false statement to an auditor.
The offences all concern the misuse of more than Pounds 712,000 belonging to
Bestwood subsidiaries and one of their pension funds and Mr Cole's attempts
to conceal this from the company's auditors.
The money was used to finance Mr Cole's personal share dealings before the
1987 stock market crash.
Mr Cole had originally pleaded not guilty to all 24 charges brought against
him by the Serious Fraud Office and his trial was due to start at the Old
Bailey yesterday morning. But he changed his pleas on eight counts,
prompting the prosecution to drop the other charges. He will be sentenced
today.
The money taken by Mr Cole came from three Bestwood subsidiaries - Atlantic
Fund Managers, Bestwood Securities and the pension fund of British Drilling
and Freezing, Mr Jeremy Roberts QC, prosecuting, said.
'He gave various false information to staff and trustees of the pension
funds to account for the disappearance of the money,' Mr Roberts said.
Mr Cole continued giving untrue accounts of his use of the money - including
perjuring himself in an affidavit to the High Court. He intended to repay
the money in due course and was confident he could make enough in the bull
market of the mid 1980s to do this, Mr Roberts said.
During this period, both Bestwood and Mr Cole enjoyed considerable apparent
success. The company grew rapidly as a result of a series of takeovers and
Mr Cole enjoyed a conspicuously expensive lifestyle.
However, the 1987 stock market crash left him heavily indebted to banks and
unable to repay money he had taken from his own companies.
The crash also left Bestwood itself over-stretched and in severe financial
difficulties. Mr Cole was forced to resign as chairman and chief executive.
Behind-the-scenes talks led to him using his compensation to repay some
debts, but some Pounds 300,000 remained unpaid.
Department of Trade and Industry inspectors were appointed in June 1989 and
reported to the SFO in early 1991. Two other men who worked for Mr Cole, Mr
Peter Southgate, an accountant, and Mr William Collins, a partner with the
now defunct stockbrokers Guy Puckle, both pleaded guilty to single charges
of false accounting last year. Mr Southgate received a suspended sentence of
15 months and Mr Collins one of nine months.

FT  27 APR 93 / NUM claim that threatened pits could make a profit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL 10 mines that are threatened with immediate closure are 'capable of
making a profit', the National Union of Mineworkers said yesterday.
Mr Arthur Scargill, the union president, said that a new study of the pits,
which employ 6,817 people, proved 'beyond any shadow of a doubt' that the
pits were viable. 'They have extensive coal reserves and all of them are
capable of making a profit or a financial contribution,' he said.
The study showed that the 10 pits had a lifetime of between three years for
Vane Tempest in the north-east and 150 years for Betws, in south Wales. The
Markham Main pit near Doncaster had 115.6m tonnes of coal reserves.
The other seven collieries that are faced with closure are Grimethorpe,
Houghton Main, Silverhill, Trentham, Parkside, Taff Merthyr, and Cotgrave.

FT  27 APR 93 / Reed opens office in prison
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REED EMPLOYMENT, the recruitment agency, yesterday opened an office inside
Holloway women's prison to provide training and work for inmates. The
project is the first of its kind to be run by an employer in a UK prison.
Prisoners will take on typing, data processing and telephone sales work for
outside companies, supervised by Reed staff. If the scheme is a success it
could be extended to other prisons, Reed said.
Part of the inmates' pay of about Pounds 3 an hour will go towards their
keep in the prison, with the rest for pocket money and savings. Women taking
part in the scheme will also be able to make a voluntary donation to the
charity Victim Support. Outside businesses will be charged ordinary basic
commercial rates for work done.
The pilot initially involves four inmates who 'go to work' each day dressed
in Reed corporate colours. A room decorated by Reed to resemble an ordinary
branch of the agency, equipped with computers and telephones, has been set
aside within the prison for the project.
Mr Alec Reed, executive chairman, said the aim was to treat the women as
ordinary temporary staff and to encourage them to identify themselves as
part of the company team. He said yesterday the only difference was that 'we
bring the work to them, rather than them going to the jobs'. Women would
finish their sentences with valuable skills, references and job prospects,
as well as earnings in the bank, said Mr Reed.
Reed has set aside Pounds 20,000 for the first year of the project out of
the funds of the registered Reed Charity, which was set up by the company.

FT  27 APR 93 / Banks may alter loans practice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH street banks are likely to consider changes to their code of practice
in the light of cases where individuals have been surprised by the amount of
money for which they are held responsible when their spouse's business
collapses.
The British Bankers' Association code says banks should advise individuals
asked to guarantee a loan for someone else to seek independent advice. The
association said further safeguards might be added to the code next year as
a result of cases such as that of Mrs Bridget O'Brien, who is resisting
Barclays' attempt to repossess her house.
Lord Inchyra, the association's director-general, said banks might consider
a safeguard to discourage individuals from unknowingly becoming responsible
for a larger sum when the loan they guarantee subsequently grows.
Mrs O'Brien's case is being heard in the House of Lords this week, and a
judgment is expected in several weeks. The Appeal Court last year overturned
a county court judgment that would have allowed Barclays to repossess her
home.
The association has started a general review of the code of practice
following its implementation in March last year. Any changes would apply
from next March.

FT  27 APR 93 / Photos 'cut card fraud by 99%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXPERIMENT in etching photographs and signatures on cheque guarantee
cards cut fraud by nearly 99 per cent, the Royal Bank of Scotland said
yesterday, John Gapper writes.
The bank, which has 1m customers, said it intended to be the first British
bank to offer them all the chance to have photographs on cards.
The laser etching of photographs and signatures on the reverse of the bank's
Highline cheque guarantee, cash dispenser and debit cards, costs about
Pounds 1.20 per card, about three times the cost of conventional cards.
The bank said an experiment, covering 30,000 customers in 39 branches over
the past 18 months, had reduced the anticipated level of fraud from about
Pounds 45,000 to three cases involving a total loss of Pounds 494.
The bank said it would not charge for such cards - though it charged
customers Pounds 2 per card in the pilot scheme. It believed it could
increase its gain by lowering the processing costs per card.
TSB has been testing putting photographs on customers' credit cards through
thermal imaging - a method adopted nationally by the National &amp; Provincial
Building society.
Mr Alex Barr, Royal Bank's card services development manager, said it was
also considering trying to put photographs on its credit cards. It would
have to negotiate this with First Data Resources, which makes its credit
cards.
He conceded that the bank's competitive advantage would probably be eroded
if other banks adopted similar tactics. At present most other financial
services companies are working together on new card fraud prevention
measures.
Mr Barr said 31,500 of the 100,000 customers offered cards in the pilot had
applied for them. The bank expected a similar proportion of all its
customers to take up the offer, but they would be free to choose.

FT  27 APR 93 / British Coal sets up fast loan plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Coal Enterprise yesterday announced almost 'instant loans' for small
businesses to try to speed up job creation in pit closure areas.
Under its new Fast Track Loans scheme, it will lend up to Pounds 15,000 at a
fixed interest rate of 9 per cent without security.
The wholly owned subsidiary of British Coal will start the scheme
immediately in Wales, the west Midlands, and north-west and north-east
England. It hopes to extend it to the east Midlands, the Yorkshire region
and Scotland before the end of next month.
Decisions on loans are promised within 21 days of application in an attempt
to counter past criticism of the subsidiary's secured lending programme, in
which decisions have taken up to six months.
The loans will be open to anyone setting up or operating a business in a
coal closure area. The subsidiary says nearly 42,000 jobs have been created
by the 3,775 projects it has backed with Pounds 76m since it was founded
eight years ago.
'We are prepared to back anything legal, barring gambling and speculative
building,' said Mr John Dutton, manager of the enterprise's Warrington-based
western region. The enterprise is usually wary of backing retail projects,
apart from cases where a former miner wants to buy a shop to provide work
for himself.
Mr Dutton said the ceiling for fast-track loans would be raised to Pounds
25,000 as soon as the scheme had proved itself.
The initial Pounds 15,000 ceiling is based on the enterprise's experience
that about 80 per cent of new businesses backed need less than this once
they have all relevant grants and as much bank funding as they could afford.

FT  27 APR 93 / World Trade News: Danes open output-for-export plant in
Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ST PETERSBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DANISH investment company 2M Invest has opened a company for manufacturing
machinery components in St Petersburg. The company, ZMI, is rare among
western investments in Russia in that it is based exclusively on production
for export to the west.
Mr Michael Mathiesen, main shareholder of 2M Invest, made his name and
fortune as founder of Dataco, a Danish company making networking equipment
for computer systems. Dataco was sold at to the UK's Dowty Group in 1990.
He decided, after looking at the potential for investment in St Petersburg,
that an ordinary joint venture or participation in a privatisation project
would not be satisfactory.
The factory is on premises rented from a state-owned company in the defence
industry. ZMI is not a normal company, as it is a production unit only. All
selling is done from a sister company, EBI Suppliers, in Copenhagen, which
also uses the facilities of the Copenhagen Free Port to hold buffer stocks.
Another of Mr Mathiesen's principles was to start small. The total
investment is DKr13.5m (Dollars 2.2m), of which 56 per cent was subscribed
by 2M Invest and 25 per cent by the Danish government's Investment Fund for
Central and Eastern Europe. Russian shareholders have about 1 per cent of
the stock and two ZMI executives have options which can be converted to
shares within two years.
The plant has a total staff of 19 and four Russian machine tools, equipped
with western cutting tools and measuring instruments. ZMI's staff is
Russian, but the management has received training in Copenhagen in how a
western company functions.
Mr Mathiesen expects to see a fairly rapid expansion of ZMI over the next
year or so, taking employment to about 100, and he expects that the
investment will be profitable. The first orders have already been received,
after test orders had showed product quality up to the standards required by
customers in Denmark and Germany.
ZMI expects to receive the coveted International Standards Organisation ISO
9002 quality control certificate this year, probably a first for a Russian
manufacturing company.
Workers at ZMI are paid the rouble equivalent of about Dollars 150 a month.
The Russian machine tools cost a fifth of the western tools, with which they
have proved to be competitive.

FT  27 APR 93 / World Trade News: Mexico may seek EC trade accord - Once
Nafta is ratified, business eyes will turn to Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO may try to pursue a trade agreement with the European Community once
the North American Free Trade Agreement has been ratified, Mr Fernando
Solana, Mexican foreign minister, said yesterday.
Mr Solana, in London for the annual meeting of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, said that Nafta ratification was the Mexican
priority, but talks about a trade agreement with Europe could start next
year.
Mexico already has a trade co-operation accord with the EC, which came into
effect in October 1991. That, for example, provides an informal disputes
procedure - but there was a desire to 'go beyond what we have,' the minister
said.
He was returning from Copenhagen, where EC and Latin American foreign
ministers were meeting, and said negotiations to complete two side
agreements to Nafta, on labour standards and the environment, should be
complete by June. This would allow for a vote on Nafta in the US Congress
after its August recess, in the third quarter or in October, permitting the
accord to be put into effect on schedule at the start of next year.
Mr Solana said he was open to the extension of Nafta elsewhere in Latin
America, in the first place to Chile, then to Colombia and Venezuela, and
including the smaller states of central America.
On Friday, President Bill Clinton had reiterated his support for Nafta, a
comment that followed fresh criticism of Nafta on Thursday by Mr Ross Perot,
who opposed Mr Clinton in the US presidential election last November.
The president added that the US needed to 'build those bridges in our own
area' by moving to expand free trade arrangements into other Latin American
nations, including Chile.
He stressed that, for Nafta to move ahead, the US had to secure supplemental
agreements to address environmental and labour issues. Noting Mexico's
concerns over creating multilateral commissions to oversee enforcement to
some degree, he said: 'There's some merit to their position.'
Mr Clinton added: 'What we're trying to do is agree on an approach that, if
there is a pattern of violation, there will be some enforcement.'

FT  27 APR 93 / World Trade News: Power companies hail the fruits of
lobbying - The EC/US trade deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL last week, there was no better way to get executives of US power
generating equipment companies on to their soapboxes than to ask them about
the difficulties of selling their products in the European market.
General Electric, the biggest US producer, regularly complained that it had
not sold a steam turbine in Europe since the Marshall Plan.
Earlier this month, Mr John Yasinsky, group president at Westinghouse
Electric, the other big US supplier, said in an interview: 'Across the board
there are European countries that are closed to us. In the US, European
competitors are competing head-to-head with us on products that we are not
allowed to sell in Europe.'
Now, after years of lobbying by the two, a transatlantic phone call between
Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative has changed the outlook.
The partial EC-US deal on public procurement reached last week waives
Article 29 of the EC utilities directive, introduced on January 1, for the
US manufacturers of heavy electrical equipment.
Two parts of Article 29 had most irritated the US companies. One was the 3
per cent rule, which stipulated that public utilities must prefer a European
bid where it is no more than 3 per cent dearer than the best bid from
overseas. The other was the local content rule which said customers could
reject a bid with less than 50 per cent of European content.
The waiver confirms Mr Yasinsky's view that the issue of access to Europe
would be more important for President Bill Clinton's administration than for
the preceding Bush and Reagan administrations. Mr Kantor's feisty style has
gone down well at Westinghouse.
At GE, the latest development is greeted with pleasure and relief. 'We're
delighted,' says Mr Eugene Zeltmann, manager for trade and industry
associations at GE Power Systems. 'An awful lot of effort has gone into
this, and it should bring more transparency and openness to the market.'
'Clearly, it's a step forward,' says Mr Frank Bakos, vice president and
general manager of Westinghouse's power generation business unit.
The problem for the US suppliers was that Article 29 re-established at
Community level the discrimination that they claim to have suffered for
years at national level. The size of power station orders, and the need to
keep local suppliers busy in a market suffering from overcapacity, has
inevitably made contract awards an intensely political affair.
On top of that, the European utilities industry remains rooted in the public
sector, with nowhere near the level of independent power production seen in
the US. Hence the importance of any regulations affecting public
procurement.
The successes achieved by the US companies in Europe have largely come
through their strategic alliances and licensing deals. GE has long
considered such alliances indispensable, particularly in less open markets.
But the focus of the alliances in Europe has been the newer technology of
gas turbines, where the US companies have more to offer potential partners
than in the more mature steam turbine technology.
The gas turbine co-operation between GE and the Anglo-French GEC Alsthom has
been an important reason for both companies' recent successes in Europe,
while the wide-ranging tie-up between Westinghouse and Rolls-Royce last year
gave the UK aero-engine and industrial power group access to heavy duty gas
turbines.
Both GE and Westinghouse, in partnership with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of
Japan, have sold gas turbines directly in the UK, although continental
Europe is much tougher even for sales via an alliance, let alone direct
sales.
For GE, therefore, the main focus of its lobbying in the public procurement
debate has been on steam turbine sales, says Mr Zeltmann, so the deal might
not make any difference to the strategic alliances. Instead, it gives the
company an opportunity to sell its steam turbines in Europe, and the company
will be bidding to test the new environment.
This could heighten yet further the contract battles in Europe for a product
where there is little to choose between the big US and European players,
where competition and pricing is already fierce, and where growth prospects
in the European Community are relatively slow.
For Mr Bakos, the access problem is more institutional than
product-specific. 'The real issue is how the ultimate process of awarding
contracts is treated,' he says. 'Will it be handled openly or fairly, or
will it go underground?'

The Canadian province of Ontario is closing all 17 of its foreign trade and
investment offices as part of moves to hold down government spending, writes
Bernard Simon in Toronto. An official of the province's economic development
and trade ministry said that, thanks to modern communications and air
travel, the offices 'are seen as structures that have outlived their time'.
Ontario will now promote its trade and investment interests through Canadian
embassies, and through more sharply-focused visits by government officials.
It also plans to work more closely with business associations abroad and
consultants hired for specific assignments. Some of the money saved will be
channelled towards providing advice within the province to companies seeking
export opportunities.

in Kuala Lumpur. The contract, awarded by Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia's
partially privatised electricity utility, is one of several multi-million
dollar deals either awarded or under consideration in Malaysia.
The country's near double-digit growth over recent years has caused an
unexpected surge in electricity demand. The government has given new
emphasis to the power sector, following several recent black-outs. The
Siemens power plant will be built at Serdang, near Kuala Lumpur, and is
scheduled for completion by the end of next year.

A GROUP of Singapore-based and Japanese investors will undertake a Dollars
905m joint venture project to redevelop the southern Vietnamese port of Vung
Tau, according to property consultants Colliers Jardine, writes Victor
Mallet, South East Asia Correspondent, in Jakarta.
Foreign investors include Singapore-based Tredia Investment and the Japanese
trading companies Mitsui and Mitsubishi. The Vietnamese partners are the
provincial communist people's committee and the state-owned National
Maritime Bureau (Vinamarine).
The Japanese government, which recently resumed aid to Vietnam, is anxious
to help Japanese investors and traders by improving Vietnam's battered
infrastructure, and is expected to provide financial assistance for the
project.
Colliers Jardine, part of the Hong Kong-based Jardine Matheson group, said
it had arranged the deal as a 'build, operate and transfer' project, with a
70-year lease on the property. Mr Ong Beng Kheong, Colliers Jardine's
executive director in Vietnam, said the project would allow Vung Tau port to
overtake the Saigon river port in Ho Chi Minh City as the country's busiest.
Under the first phase of the project, construction of a terminal for bulk,
conventional and containerised cargo should begin next year, boosting
handling capacity to 18m tonnes per year by 1998 from the current 4m tonnes.

FT  27 APR 93 / Brazil central bank may go it alone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Itamar Franco of Brazil yesterday announced his intention to make
the country's central bank independent, to reinforce the measures announced
in his economic plan on Saturday.
He gave no details of the decision but aides said that he was meeting
economists yesterday to prepare draft legislation to present to Congress.
Analysts were confused by the move, which followed Mr Franco's announcement
on Saturday that interest rates on short-term investments would be cut to
below inflation, so as to deter financial speculation and stimulate growth.
The surprise interest rate cut will be brought in gradually, according to Mr
Eliseu Resende, finance minister. It is the most radical part of the package
of measures he will present today to the International Monetary Fund, in the
hope of a new stand-by accord.
A senior IMF official, speaking last week before the measures were
announced, warned that the fund's patience with Brazil's 'six years of
gradualist approach' was running out. The IMF was not willing to jeopardise
its credibility by supporting what it saw as 'an overly gradualist and
minimally ambitious programme'.
The official described the country's record as 'a scandal that has to be
corrected'.
The IMF is expected to question the plan's concentration on spending to
stimulate growth and alleviate poverty rather than on tackling inflation,
now 30 per cent a month.
Mr Resende insists 'the government will only spend what it can raise', but
the measures seem unlikely to achieve his target of removing the deficit,
now at Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn).
The plan includes considerable cuts in spending by state companies and
revenue-raising exercises such as acceleration of the privatisation
programme and cracking down on tax evaders, but the measures will need time
to have any effect.
The plan leaves real fiscal reform to be tackled during the debate on
constitutional revision in October. 'It is hardly a frontal attack on
inflation,' commented Mr Roberto Macedo, a former secretary of economic
policy. 'It is more something to gain time.'
There was also criticism over the decision to raise money through the sale
of preferential shares in so-called strategic state companies, such as the
electricity utility Eletrobras and the telecoms entity Telebras, with
analysts pointing out that the government would be selling cheaply.
But Brazil's financial markets reacted positively to the Franco plan,
relieved by the absence of heterodox measures which have characterised
previous Brazilian economic packages. Traders said they believed it
signified the end of the paralysis which has marked the first six months of
the Franco government.
Banks operated normally yesterday, in sharp contrast to the panic that has
greeted previous plans, and the main Sao Paulo stock market rose 5 per cent
before lunchtime.
The director of a leading bank said: 'It is not a messianic plan, it doesn't
promise zero inflation and it doesn't confiscate anything. It's basically a
'let's stick by the budget' plan. What matters now is whether the government
has the political will to execute it.'
The new measures need Congressional approval.

FT  27 APR 93 / Cautious budget for Canadians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S finance minister yesterday tabled a cautious pre-election budget,
avoiding tax increases and making an unexpectedly modest dent in government
spending.
Mr Donald Mazankowski forecast that the federal budget deficit would fall to
CDollars 32.6bn (Pounds 16.8bn) in the fiscal year to March 31 1994, from
CDollars 35.5bn in 1992-93. Last year's shortfall was CDollars 8bn higher
than the 1992 budget projection, and more than CDollars 1bn above estimates
made last December.
The 1992-93 deficit, the second highest on record, was blamed on shrinking
tax revenues caused by the recession and low inflation.
The Progressive Conservative government has repeatedly failed, during its
nine years in office, to meet its deficit-reduction targets. However, Mr
Mazankowski pledged yesterday to eliminate all new government borrowing
within five years.
Federal spending will rise by 1.5 per cent next year - a zero increase in
real terms. However, with a general election likely to be held in September
or October, Mr Mazankowski's belt-tightening excluded touchy political
subjects such as social security programmes and revenue transfers to the
provinces.
Even so, grants to special interest groups will be cut by 15 per cent in the
1995-96 fiscal year, with further reductions later. Several government
agencies due to be disbanded as part of the budget measures exist only on
paper.
Mr Mazankowski forecast that Canada's growth rate would accelerate to 4.6
per cent in real terms in 1994, from 2.9 per cent this year.

FT  27 APR 93 / Venezuelan opposition picks reformer: Battle lines drawn for
a presidential election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAIN Venezuelan opposition party has chosen a state governor favouring
economic and political reform as its candidate for the presidential election
due in December.
The social Christian party (Copei), voting in open primary elections on
Sunday, chose Mr Oswaldo Alvarez Paz, governor of the western state of
Zulia, which produces most of Venezuela's oil and agricultural products.
Mr Alvarez, 50, won clearly, with some 60 per cent of 2m votes cast,
according to preliminary figures. This gives the Copei candidate strong
impetus for the presidential race.
Mr Eduardo Fernandez, who has long controlled Copei's bureaucracy and was
its presidential candidate in 1988, received a disappointing 34 per cent,
and Mr Humberto Calderon Berti, a former minister, came third. The two
losers pledged party unity and support for Mr Alvarez.
The Copei presidential candidate says he supports free market policies and
broad political reform. Mr Alvarez joined the party at the age of 14. He is
a lawyer, has occupied various party jobs and has been a member of the
Chamber of Deputies. He won the Zulia governorship in 1989, and was
re-elected last December.
The choice of Mr Alvarez puts Venezuela's 1993 presidential campaign into
better focus, both of the country's main political groups, the governing
Democratic Action Party (AD) and Copei, now having chosen their candidates.
On April 18, AD elected Mr Claudio Fermn, a 43-year-old former mayor of
Caracas, as its presidential standard-bearer.
Other figures seeking the presidency are Mr Rafael Caldera, aged 77 and
president in 1969-1974, and Mr Andres Velasquez, aged 40 and the left-wing
governor of the south-eastern state of Bolvar.
Mr Caldera founded Copei and was its long-time chief, but he broke with the
party after Mr Fernandez won the presidential nomination in 1987. Mr Caldera
said he will run in December as an independent.
The Sunday primary suggests that Venezuelans want a younger generation in
the presidency and a chief executive identified as a party 'outsider'. Mr
Alvarez, although linked with Copei for many years, has not been at the top.
He has been very critical of corruption among the ruling cliques of
Venezuelan political parties and the way party officials are chosen.
The Copei election marked the first time that a political party in Venezuela
has held an open presidential primary where any registered voter, regardless
of party affiliation, could participate.
The turnout was larger than expected, with almost 20 per cent of Venezuela's
9.8m registered voters taking part. Fewer than 600,000 people participated
in AD's primary.

SALES of previously owned US homes dropped 2.9 per cent in March, the third
straight month of declines caused by severe weather, a real estate trade
group said yesterday, AP reports from Washington.
Sales fell in every region except the Midwest.
The National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned homes
totalled 3.36m at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in March, down from
3.46m a month earlier.
The revised 8.5 per cent drop in sales in February was even steeper than the
6.1 per cent initial estimate. Sales had fallen 6.4 per cent in January
after rising 4.7 per cent in the final month of 1992.
Mr William S. Chee, president of the association, said this year's big
blizzard brought housing activity to a virtual standstill for several days
in March in the south and north-east. But he said anecdotal evidence
suggested sales had resumed: 'Buyers are continuing to take advantage of low
mortgage rates.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CORRUPTION is part of doing business in Argentina, a fact now recognised by
the University of Buenos Aires, which will include a new course on 'perverse
systems' in its MBA syllabus.
The course - the first of its kind in Argentina - is to begin next week. It
will focus on the causes and nature of corruption, and discuss ways to
combat it.
Prof Jorge Etkin, who will lead the course, says it will be based on case
studies of 100 episodes of corruption. Lecturers will include businessmen,
judges and government officials, including the mayor of Buenos Aires. His
predecessor was charged last week with fraudulent administration.
Opinion polls report corruption as a main concern of Argentines, a large
majority of whom see the government of President Carlos Menem as corrupt.
Mr Menem's free market policies have reduced corruption, through substantial
deregulation packages and privatisations, but businessmen still complain
that politicians and bureaucrats exploit every opportunity to demand bribes.
The administration has been rocked by 19 big corruption scandals since it
took office in July 1989, and 20 senior aides and ministers have been sacked
on suspicion of corruption. For all that, no investigation has ended in a
trial. Mr Luis Moreno Ocampo, a former federal prosecutor, says Argentine
laws make convictions in corruption cases impossible.
Prof Etkin, author of a book on corruption, says: 'When the justice system
does not work independently or efficiently, there is always a greater
predisposition to corruption in democracies. Weak justice systems lead to
impunity.' Yet he stresses that one can do business in Argentina without
becoming involved in corruption. He says, 'business is not just about
profit, but (ensuring) the survival of a company - this depends directly on
a company obeying the law.'

FT  27 APR 93 / US healthcare plans worry trade unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WITH the unveiling of the Clinton administration's healthcare reform plan
just weeks away, industries and trade unions are arguing nervously over the
degree to which businesses should be compelled to come into the scheme the
administration is expected to propose.
One core component of the reform is to be the creation of regional
purchasing pools, which the administration hopes will keep a lid on costs by
bringing to bear the buying power of thousands of people insured by their
employers or by state health schemes.
But big businesses may be allowed to stay outside these pools, according to
a report in the New York Times, prompting concerns particularly among trade
unions that this could undercut the equitable treatment of all citizens.
Mr Lane Kirkland, president of the American Federation of Labor-Congress of
Industrial Organisations, the main grouping of unions in the US, has written
to Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton, who heads the White House healthcare reform
task force, arguing strongly against allowing employers to opt out.
One criticism that has been made of the proposal is that it would turn the
state-sponsored pools into dumping grounds for the poor and the sick and for
companies with older or less healthy workforces.
Most big businesses argue, however, that they already exert enough
purchasing power to keep down their health insurance costs on their own; if
they were forced into the state-sponsored pools, this could disrupt their
often complex labour agreements, which usually cover health benefits.
Administration officials say big employers would, in any case, be required
to comply with new federal guidelines on the type of health coverage they
give their workers.
The controversy encapsulates one of the dilemmas for reform: how to achieve
universal, government-mandated health coverage while avoiding a universal,
government-run health insurance scheme.

THE US space shuttle Columbia went into orbit yesterday with seven

reports from Cape Canaveral.
It was Nasa's third attempt to launch Columbia on the laboratory research
mission. The first, a month ago, ended abruptly with an engine shutdown.
Eighty-eight Spacelab experiments are planned involving about 200 scientists
from around the world, including a slew of medical tests.
All science will be managed from the control centre in Germany, with Nasa's
Johnson Space Centre in Houston overseeing everything else on the nine-day
flight. The only other time a US space mission has been controlled from
outside the US was during Germany's first Spacelab flight, aboard shuttle
Challenger in 1985.
This mission was targeted for 1988 but put on hold along with everything
else after Challenger exploded in 1986.

THE International Monetary Fund yesterday urged governments to take
'effective action' to increase world growth by a combined programme of cuts
in interest rates, together with moves to bring down state borrowing.
The suggestion, in the Fund's World Economic Outlook, published yesterday,
is aimed primarily at Germany, where the level of interest rates has a big
effect on borrowing conditions throughout Europe, and where the fiscal
deficit has soared since reunification.
The study sees 'a considerable risk' that the prospective fall in interest
rates across Europe, sparked by likely Bundesbank easing in the coming
months, 'might occur too late or be insufficient to contain the negative
forces' damping European economic activity and raising unemployment.
According to a possible programme of action outlined by the IMF, the
'principal contribution' to a world growth package would be 'a further,
significant and progressive reduction in interest rates, starting in
Germany'.
The IMF says the idea of lower interest rates 'is generally warranted in
light of the current weakness of activity and declining inflation in most
(industrial) countries'.
At the same time industrial nations should cut their rising government
deficits to boost confidence of financial markets and clear the way to
steady long-term economic expansion.
The IMF has slashed its growth projection for the EC this year, arguing this
will be a minuscule 0.1 per cent. In its last outlook, last October, it said
EC growth would be 2.3 per cent in 1993. Growth in the US is more
encouraging and is picking up virtually as predicted six months ago.
However, Mr Michael Mussa, director of the IMF's research department,
yesterday called on the US government to show 'somewhat more movement' in
pushing down its large fiscal deficit, which on current plans is to come
down to about 3 per cent of gross domestic product by 1998, excluding social
security payments. Even then, it was 'desirable' to cut the deficit by a
further 2 percentage points 'over the longer term'.
The expected recovery in the international economy is 'hesitant and uneven',
the report says, with prospects affected by factors in many nations,
including 'extensive balance sheet restructuring, persistently high
short-term real interest rates, considerable financial tensions and
depressed levels of consumer and business confidence'.

THE DIFFICULTIES of European Community countries in meeting the economic
convergence targets specificed by the Maastricht treaty could hold up moves
towards economic and monetary union, the IMF suggests.
Of the 12 nations, only Luxembourg meets all four targets on the basis of
its economic performance last year. Five countries - France, Germany, the
UK, Denmark and Ireland - meet three of the criteria. Belgium and the
Netherlands satisfy only two, Spain meets one, and Italy, Greece and
Portugal fail on all four.
The relevant criteria, given as guidelines in the treaty, are that consumer
price inflation must not exceed by more than half a percentage point the
average for the three member states with the lowest inflation rates;
interest rates on long-term government securities must not be more than two
percentage points higher than those in the same three member states; general
government deficit is limited to 3 per cent or less of GDP; and the public
debt/GDP ratio should be less than 60 per cent.
In 1992, Britain failed the targets because of its large government deficit,
as did France. Germany fell down on its inflation record; Denmark and
Ireland failed to meet the target on government debt.

FT  27 APR 93 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Reduction in fiscal deficits
urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY industrial nations should take steps to reduce fiscal deficits to boost
the confidence of financial markets and lay foundations for long-term
growth, the IMF says.
A big factor behind much of the world's economic fragility is the high level
of state borrowing, which the report says has sapped the confidence of
investors and reduced governments' opportunities to lessen unemployment by
cash injections into their economies.
Governments should reduce spending or raise taxes to 'achieve a more
efficient balance of public and private spending'. The IMF says: 'By
improving opportunities for private investment and reducing the cost of
capital, fiscal consolidation raises countries' medium-term growth
prospects.'
The higher deficits have come about partly because of economic slowdown and
partly because governments have failed to control rises in state spending
unrelated to the economic cycle.
In 1993 the structural budget deficits of Germany, France, Canada, the UK
and the US are estimated by the IMF to be 2-5 per cent of gross domestic
product. Italy's figure is 'considerably higher'. The structural budget
deficit is defined as state borrowing excluding borrowing due to higher
spending or lower tax revenues linked to economic weakening.
In 1989, according to the report, the deficits were generally lower, at 1 to
3 per cent of GDP, in the US, France and Britain and 4 per cent in Canada,
while Japan and Germany both had structural surpluses.
Britain's structural budget deficit showed a particularly large increase in
1992 and there is likely to be another big rise this year, the report says.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEDIUM-TERM economic prospects for the developing world appear brighter than
for decades, the International Monetary Fund reports in its World Economic
Outlook.
After growing by more than 6 per cent last year, the best result in more
than 10 years, the economies of the developing countries are projected to
achieve growth rates of 5 per cent in 1993 and 1994, accelerating to an
average 5 3/4 per cent in 1995-98.
Economic performance has diverged widely among countries, however, and the
IMF notes with disappointment its failure to find evidence that living
standards in the developing world are catching up with those prevailing in
industrialised nations.
Nevertheless, the Fund's economists expect some convergence in economic
performance over the medium term as more countries in Asia, Latin America
and Africa implement the kinds of macro-economic policies they advocate, and
as more countries get over the debt servicing problems they experienced in
the 1980s.
Western hemisphere countries, in particular, are forecast to show a strong
pick-up from 2.5 per cent annual growth in 1993-94 to 4.8 per cent in
1995-98.
Growth in Asia is expected to remain strong, averaging 6.6 per cent in
1993-94 and 7 per cent in 1995-98, while growth in Africa is projected to
accelerate from 3.3 per cent over the next two years to 4.4 per cent in
1995-98.
Developing countries in the Middle East and Europe are expected to show
stable growth averaging 4.4 per cent a year from 1993 to 1998.
The IMF says the developing countries with the best growth share some
characteristics: low and predictable inflation, stable fiscal balances, low
but positive real interest rates, competitive and relatively stable exchange
rates.
They have higher and more efficient investment, financed by high rates of
domestic saving, and strong export growth resulting from outward-oriented
trade and industrial policies, which do not discriminate between production
for the domestic market and for export, or between purchases of domestic and
foreign goods.
Stable macro-economic policies may not be enough to ensure strong growth,
the IMF warns, citing the slow growth of the CFA franc zone in West Africa
and India's moderate growth, now accelerating in response to structural
reforms.

FT  27 APR 93 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Hyperinflation threatens eastern
European reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CENTRAL Europe and the former Soviet Union will need continued financial and
technical help from the industrialised nations, if they are to stay on the
path of economic reform, the IMF warns.
Most countries of central and eastern Europe have already adopted radical
changes in economic policy, but the course of reform faces considerable
strains from large government budget deficits and from the threat of
hyperinflation.
'The risk of hyperinflation is now the major threat to continued reform in
the former Soviet Union. High and accelerating inflation has already caused
massive capital flight and, if unchecked, will eventually destroy the price
system and make further economic reform virtually impossible,' the report
warns.
The IMF's economists have revised their growth forecasts for both central
Europe and the former Soviet Union sharply downwards since their last
projections six months ago.
Even so, they see the severe economic contraction experienced in central
Europe in 1991 and 1992 slowing down this year, with growth resuming in
1994.
Output is still expected to contract by 11.8 per cent in the former Soviet
Union this year, and by 3.5 per cent in 1994.
'But, if macroeconomic stability can be achieved and if the economic reform
programmes are followed through, most of the countries in the former Soviet
Union could experience sharply falling inflation during 1993 and economic
turnaround as early as the middle of the decade,' the report says.
The IMF warns that government budgets are still showing considerable strains
in central Europe because of the dramatic decline in tax revenues. Albania,
Bulgaria and the former Yugoslavia all showed budget deficits in excess of
10 per cent of gross domestic product last year.
In the former Soviet Union, the republics of Armenia, Georgia and Ukraine
all ran government deficits in excess of 30 per cent of GDP.
Monetisation of these deficits, with excessive credit expansion by the
central banks and the explosive growth of inter-enterprise arrears, are the
main factors behind inflation, the report warns.

FT  27 APR 93 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Growth prospects shrinking - The
industrialised countries in difficulties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWTH prospects for the industrialised world have deteriorated sharply in
recent months, partly as a result of the serious slowdown in Europe and of
governmental failure to tackle big budget deficits, the International
Monetary Fund said yesterday.
In its twice-yearly World Economic Outlook, the fund says that, in Europe,
'there is a risk that high real interest rates, weak confidence, continuing
exchange rate turbulence and uncertainties about implementation of the
Maastricht treaty may continue to delay recovery.'
While the outlook for the US is more favourable, the recent weakening in the
Japanese economy has been another factor behind the deterioration in world
growth prospects.
The report suggests that, in the light of low Japanese inflation and the
strength of the yen, there 'remains some room' for cuts in Japanese interest
rates if the economy stays sickly.
The report also says the recent devaluations of some currencies in the
European exchange rate mechanism may have 'overshot', worsening economic
strains throughout the continent.
Countries which devalued during the crisis between last September and early
this year include Britain, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland. Increased
economic pressures may have arisen from a stimulus to inflation in the
nations affected, or by their deriving a competitive advantage which other
countries might resent.
The report, written by IMF economists after consultations with member
states, says that, within the ERM, uncertainties are still evident as a
result of the high level of interest rates in Germany. However, there are
good grounds for believing German rates may come down soon, in the light of
reduced worries about inflation as the German economy weakens.
Growth in the industrialised world is projected this year at 1.7 per cent,
as opposed to the 2.9 per cent forecast in the IMF's last economic outlook
last October. Last year, output expanded by 1.5 per cent; in 1994, the
corresponding figure is likely to be 2.9 per cent, according to the IMF's
latest predictions.
The IMF is forecasting growth this year across the European Community of a
feeble 0.1 per cent, compared with a forecast six months ago of 2.3 per
cent. Much of this revision is due to the IMF now thinking the German
economy will contract by 1.3 per cent this year. In October, the
organisation had thought it would expand by a vigorous 2.6 per cent.
Projections for Japanese growth this year have also come down - to 1.3 per
cent from 3.8 per cent last October. US output is expected to increase this
year by 3.1 per cent, in line with what the IMF said six months ago.
In the US, even though the IMF says the 'pressing priority' for the
government of President Bill Clinton is to reduce its large fiscal deficit,
the document is relatively bullish about growth prospects.
In the industrialised countries, inflation has generally come down, in line
with slower economic activity. Consumer prices went up by 3.2 per cent
across these nations last year; the comparable figure is expected to come
down to 3 per cent this year and stay at that level in 1994.
World trade volumes have seen generally healthy expansion, thanks partly to
relatively high growth outside the industrial nations.
Total world output this year is likely to show higher growth than in the
industrial nations alone. The figure for the whole world is put at 2.2 per
cent, accelerating to 3.4 per cent in 1994.
This is largely due to the good economic performance of the developing
nations, which are reckoned to be responsible for 34.4 per cent of the total
international economy, with the industrialised countries accounting for 54.4
per cent, and the ex-communist countries of eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union responsible for 11.2 per cent.

<TEXT>
INDIA'S finance minister Mr Manmohan Singh yesterday announced that the
'internal control mechanism' of India's central bank would be revamped and
its board reconstituted 'very soon' to prevent misuse of funds by banks in
securities transactions, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi.
Mr Singh, who was questioned for nearly four hours by a parliamentary
committee investigating the Rs37bn (Pounds 784m) Bombay securities scandal
that broke last year, admitted failure of the Reserve Bank's supervisory
machinery, and said that the bank had failed to take 'prompt corrective
action'.
However, the minister fiercely defended Mr S Venkitaramanan, former Reserve
Bank governor, saying he had 'done his duty well' despite 'tremendous
pressure of the foreign exchange crisis' India suffered in 1991.
Mr Singh insisted that neither he nor his ministry had been aware that the
funds which had fuelled the artificial escalation of the Bombay stock market
last year came from banks 'in an illegal or clandestine manner', as
suggested by the investigating committee.

FT  27 APR 93 / Nigeria cracks down on petrol smuggling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA yesterday banned all cross-border movements of petrol in an effort
to halt domestic fuel shortages and stop smuggling, Our Foreign Staff
writes.
The official petrol price in Nigeria is 0.7 naira a litre (about 1 1/2
pence), compared with N9.72 in Benin, N10.93 in Cameroon, N14.61 in Niger
and N16.11 in Chad.
Massive smuggling of petrol to these neighbouring states has left some parts
of Nigeria short of fuel. It also represents a substantial loss of revenue
for the government and the state-owned Nigerian National Petrolum
Corporation (NNPC). The government has said it plans to raise petrol prices
but has deferred implementing the decision, bitterly opposed by most
Nigerians, until after mid-June presidential elections.

FT  27 APR 93 / Japanese vehicle output falls 6.2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE vehicle production fell by 6.2 per cent in the year to the end of
March, the sharpest fall since 1974 when the industry was hit by the deep
recession brought on by the rise in world oil prices.
The fall, the second consecutive year in which car production has declined,
underlines the severity of the decline in Japanese personal consumption in
the past year.
Car makers played down the significance of a modest pick-up in car
production in March, about 0.8 per cent up from the year before. The
Japanese Automobile Manufacturers Association says that in spite of the
increase in output, new car sales in the first half of April were more than
10 per cent down on last year.
Japanese vehicle makers produced 12,334,999 cars, buses and trucks in the
year. Domestic sales fell by 7.4 per cent to 6.9m units, while exports fell
by 2.9 per cent to about 5.66m vehicles. Passenger car production fell 4.3
per cent at 9.3m units, while truck production was about 12 per cent down at
1.9m.
The restructuring forced on car producers by the downturn took another small
step forward yesterday when two car producers, Nissan and Isuzu, announced
an agreement for Nissan to supply Isuzu with minibuses which would be
marketed under Isuzu's name.
The spread of the consumer downturn was reflected in an 8.8 per cent fall in
department store sales in March from a year before. Sales fell to Y772.5bn
(Pounds 4.47bn), the 13th consecutive monthly drop. Excluding an 8.9 per
cent fall in March 1990 the decline last month was the sharpest recorded
since the department stores association started collecting data in 1965.
The economic outlook was further complicated yesterday when three long term
credit banks, the Industrial Bank of Japan, Long Term Credit Bank and Nippon
Credit Bank, announced a 0.2 percentage point rise in their prime lending
rate to 5.1 per cent, which some analysts believe may begin an upward
movement in Japanese interest rates.

FT  27 APR 93 / Oxfam wants urgent Marshall Plan for Africa: West attacked
for lacking political will while IMF/World Bank policies 'hurt but do not
work'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OXFAM yesterday called on the west to back a Marshall Plan for sub-Saharan
Africa, warning that without greater assistance the region's economic crisis
is set to deepen.
'Africa is on a knife edge,' Mr David Bryer, director of the Oxford-based
charity, told the London launch of its Africa recovery programme.
The end of the Cold War, 'fragile' peace in Ethiopia, Eritrea and
Mozambique, and the emergence of more representative governments in Africa
provided the opening for a western initiative, said Mr Bryer, adding:
'Northern nations have the power to tip the balance: to support the current
opportunities for recovery or to sentence the region to a spiralling and
agonising decline.'
But unless the opportunity were seized, prospects were bleak, Mr Bryer
warned. In the words of the charity's 40-page analysis* of the crisis:
'Economic stagnation, social breakdown, decaying infrastructures, crippling
debt burdens, ruinous prices for commodity exports, and environmental
degradation threaten to retard Africa's development prospects into the next
century, with frightening consequences for human welfare.'
'Without recovery, more than 300m people - half the region's population -
will be living in poverty by the end of the decade.'
The report accuses the west of lacking the political will, contrasting the
response to problems of eastern Europe and Russia with 'their neglect for
over a decade of Africa's far deeper problems'.
Some of Oxfam's sharpest criticism is directed at the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank, arguing that their policies are 'hurting but not
working'.
The Fund's 'increasingly damaging role' stems from policy mistakes in the
early 1980s, says the report: 'The Fund treated what was a problem of
insolvency as one of short-term liquidity, extending short-term loans at
high interest rates to cover structural and trade deficits.'
The Fund embarked on financing 'what was bound to be a slow process of
adjustment and recovery with the wrong resources and the wrong approach . .
.'.
'Africa has been paying the price ever since.' It is time for northern
governments 'to face up to the fact that the IMF has failed Africa . . .'.
'The time has come either fundamentally to reform the IMF or extricate it
from Africa.'
The report calls for a write-off or concessional rescheduling of much of the
region's external debt.
The debt crisis is deepening, says Oxfam. Total external debt in 1992 was
Dollars 183bn (Pounds 116bn), including IMF and World Bank debt - Dollars
30bn higher than in 1989 when large scale cancellations began.
Multilateral agencies, mainly the World Bank and IMF, accounted for 36 per
cent of debt servicing payments in 1991. Neither agency, under existing
rules, is permitted to reschedule or write off debt.
Tackling the debt burden would be central to Oxfam's five-point recovery
programme, which urges western governments to treat Africa with the same
sense of urgency and concern that prompted the Marshall Plan.
Under the plan, launched at the end of the second world war, the US
transferred some 2 per cent of its gross national product to support the
rebuilding of post-war Europe.
Oxfam will put its debt proposals to the G7 summit in Tokyo in July.
Oxfam's recovery programme also calls for:
Increased aid flows, moving towards the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GDP for
aid budgets. Oxfam urges Britain to take a lead by agreeing an extra Pounds
100m in support of Africa's recovery.
A fund to help Africa process its commodity exports; the ending of
subsidised disposal of agricultural surpluses; reduction of protectionist
barriers against Africa's exports.
Reform of structural adjustment programmes, including protection for African
industries and greater investment in health and education.
Strengthening the UN role in aid and peacekeeping; the appointment of one
special representative responsible for co-ordinating UN operations.
The report says that while the 1980s were grim, 'things are getting steadily
worse'. Gains in health and education are being eroded, and as a result
'Africa is being disempowered as the educational gap between itself and
other parts of the world widens'.
Oxfam's analysis is at odds with the World Bank's appraisal, published last
February.* * 'Sub-Saharan countries have achieved significant progress in
the last few years. Growth has resumed,' said the Bank.
Though it acknowledges the 1990s will be a critical decade, the Bank
maintains that there has been general agreement on the merits of its
reforms, arguing that 'adjustment has improved the lives of the vast
majority of Africa's poor'.

FT  27 APR 93 / China-Taiwan meeting is 'the first crack in their Berlin
Wall' / The talks in Singapore today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE and TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first tentative steps towards resolving more than 40 years of animosity
between China and Taiwan are likely to be taken today when representatives
of the two meet in Singapore.
The meeting will be the highest level of contact between Beijing and Taipei
since the foundation of the People's Republic of China in 1949 and the
decampment to Taiwan of Generalissimo Chiang Kai Shek and his Kuomingtang
(KMT) forces.
The talks are described as unofficial and it is unlikely that they will mark
any big diplomatic breakthrough. Nor is anyone suggesting that the years of
mistrust between China and Taiwan are about to come to an end.
But the meeting does have considerable symbolic significance. Even the
delegates themselves seem in awe at the turn of events. 'We will be
witnessing one of the historic moments of the century,' said one delegate.
Mr Wang Daohan, leader of the Chinese delegation to the talks, said China is
ready to offer Taiwan peaceful reunification. 'We stand for peaceful
reunification,' said Mr Wang soon after arriving in Singapore. 'As both
sides share the wish to develop cross-straits relations and realise peaceful
reunification, there is nothing that we cannot sit down and talk about.'
Western analysts in Beijing say China appears to have initiated a bold shift
to a more conciliatory Taiwan policy, details of which are only now
emerging. Various factors have prompted the change:
China realises the substantial gains to be had from an alliance between its
own fast-growing economy and a cash-rich Taiwan (Taiwan has foreign exchange
reserves of more than USDollars 80bn (Pounds 51bn). China not only needs
Taiwan's capital, it also needs its expertise in a number of fields.
As China's trading power grows it is becoming increasingly concerned about
access to markets and fearful of possible protectionism in the form of the
North American Free Trade Agreement and the European single market. Beijing
is beginning to see the value of a stronger north-east Asia regional trading
axis which would include Japan, South Korea, possibly the resource-rich
Soviet far east - and Taiwan.
China's elderly leadership is concerned about the rise of an opposition in
Taiwan demanding not only more democracy but also independence. Any such
move is anathema to China. Beijing had always argued that its first priority
was Hong Kong and that there was plenty of time to deal with Taiwan after
1997. This has changed: China's leaders feel that forces in Taiwan in favour
of reunification are in urgent need of a boost.
Taiwan also seems to realise it has far more to gain than lose by a closer
relationship with China.
As China's economy has opened up, investment from Taiwan has flooded in.
According to the official New China News Agency some 12,000 Taiwan-funded
enterprises have been established on the mainland with total investment of
USDollars 8.9bn. Taiwan says that last year alone Taiwanese businesses
invested Dollars 5.5bn in China while two-way trade was more than Dollars
7bn. Taiwan wants to establish some legal framework for the protection of
such investments.
Taiwan's KMT government is as anxious as Beijing to contain the rise of the
opposition. It sees making moves towards reunification and normalising
relations with Beijing as one way of doing this, though this also brings
opposition accusations of 'selling out' Taiwan's interests to Beijing.
The opening up of China and the easing of travel restrictions to the
mainland by Taiwan has led to increased contact between people on the two
sides of the Taiwan straits. Many of the big spenders visiting cities such
as Shanghai are from Taiwan. Cultural, linguistic and family ties are still
strong. Families split for the past 40 years have been reunited. According
to the Taiwan authorities about 5,000 Taiwanese have applied for approval to
bring their spouses from the mainland to Taiwan in the past two years.
The Singapore meeting has involved much delicate diplomatic manoeuvring. It
is believed to have been arranged by Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's elder
statesman, who over the years has managed to maintain close personal
contacts with both Beijing and Taipei.
Mr Lee has recently been emphasising the need for Singapore to invest more
abroad, particularly in China. By playing host to such a meeting,
Singapore's standing in Beijing will be considerably enhanced.
Because Beijing refuses to recognise Taiwan as an entity in its own right,
it is represented in Singapore by a semi-official body called the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits. For its part Taiwan is
represented by the Straits Exchange Foundation, also described as a
semi-official group.
Much ground has to be covered before these two once bitter enemies become
friends. Officials concede that it will be some time before they even have
direct trade, transport or postal links.
But Singapore marks the start of a process. 'It's something which would have
been inconceivable only a short time ago,' said a Singapore-based analyst.
'In its own way it is a bit like the first crack appearing in the Berlin
Wall.'

FT  27 APR 93 / Yemeni rulers approach poll without doubt: Illiteracy
confounds secrecy in ballot requiring written vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON and ERIC WATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WILL TAKE three days for the results of today's first general election in
unified Yemen to be published. Few, however, doubt the likely outcome - a
strong enough showing for the two parties that engineered unification in
1990, North Yemen's General People's Congress and the south's Yemen
Socialist Party, to continue in coalition government.
Both parties have made it clear that Yemen 'requires' a coalition to nurture
its democratic experiment, which, on paper, is the most ambitious ever
undertaken in the Gulf.
Generously, they have also said that other successful parties in the
election will be welcome to join them in ruling the Gulf's poorest and most
populous, fractious and ruggedly wild territory.
This formula is likely to draw in several members of Islah, an alliance of
Islamists and the country's biggest tribal group, the Hashid, which is
Yemen's fourth biggest party and, possibly, a few members of the Ba'ath
party.
President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the GPC leader, told a weekend press
conference: 'There is the idea that there should be a coalition - giving the
chance to other parties to come forward and participate in government with
us.'
Even the most enthusiastic among international observers witnessing the
election agree with opposition parties that there has been, as one US
observer put it, 'some major fancy footwork going on' to ensure GPC and YSP
dominance in the poll. But both the government and opposition groups hope,
for slightly different reasons, that today's ballot will mark an historic
turning point.
For the governing parties, the poll will lend their rule representative
legitimacy. But it also offers the hope that Yemen can rehabilitate an image
in the west which was tattered by its refusal to join the anti-Iraq
coalition during the Gulf war. That directly cost Yemen an estimated Dollars
2bn (Pounds 1.27bn) in aid from the Gulf, US, Britain and others - money
Yemen, with 13m people, and a failing economy, cannot afford to lose.
'We are hoping the elections will very much improve our relations with these
countries,' says Mr Ali Salem al-Deid, the vice-president. 'It is time for
these countries to support us.'
Projecting a progressive image of democratisation and stability is also
vital to sustaining the confidence of the 20 international oil companies
already in Yemen, and to attracting more. Hopes of economic revival rest
entirely on the prospect of raising oil production from the present 180,000
barrels a day to 1m b/d, based on the government's optimistic reading of
Yemen's potential reserves.
For the smaller opposition parties in the election today's vote offers the
prospect of Yemen moving towards a centralised, constitutionally guaranteed
civic society. Previously, power was brokered, often violently, between the
still non-unified army, the ruling parties and tribal groupings.
'The army and the tribes are still stronger than civil society here,' says
Mr Mohammed Abdul al-Mutawqil, an independent candidate. 'They have the
authority, the money and the guns.'
For many, the cosy-looking struggle between the main parties is less
important than a broader contest within the country between the forces in
favour of consolidating their present powers and the forces of democratic
and constitutional change.
Mr al-Mutawqil says this battle is being waged inside the biggest parties,
by the younger technocrats within Yemen's elite, as well as against these
parties. He believes that if 20 per cent of the 301 deputies returned after
the election represent the progressive tendency, that will constitute a
substantial success and platform for future elections.
Neither he nor other opposition figures believe they can realistically hope
for much more out of what is, after all, a considerable experiment.
Mr Abdul Rahman al-Jifri, leader of the opposition Son of Yemen League,
points out that both the GPC and YSP were former ruling parties. 'They have
never implemented democracy in their lives - how can we expect they'll do so
now?' he says.
Allegations of vote-buying, the pre-filling of soldiers' ballots, drawing
constituencies in the ruling parties' favour and other charges have dogged
the campaign and raised eyebrows among the 20-strong team of international
observers.
Some 37,000 troops are being deployed to help guarantee peace. But there are
some signs of procedural difficulties. The election observers, though loath
to commit themselves before the poll takes place, have raised doubts about
some aspects of the ballot. Concern centres on the fact that, with up to 80
per cent illiteracy in Yemen, a large proportion of the 2.7m registered
voters will have to enlist help in the polling station to cast their vote
 for which they are required to write in the candidate's name on the ballot
sheet.
Mr Ed Stuart, observer with the International Republican Institute, said it
was 'highly unusual to see a ballot constructed' as it has been in Yemen. 'I
think it will present some problems.' A colleague went further: 'The concept
of a secret ballot has gone out of the window,' he said.

FT  27 APR 93 / Internal control of India's central bank to be revamped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S finance minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, yesterday announced that the
'internal control mechanism' of India's central bank would be revamped and
its board reconstituted 'very soon' to prevent misuse of funds by banks in
securities transactions.
Mr Singh, who was questioned for nearly four hours by a parliamentary
committee investigating the Rs37bn (Pounds 784m) Bombay securities scandal
that broke last year, admitted failure of the Reserve Bank's supervisory
machinery, and said that the bank had failed to take 'prompt corrective
action'.
However, the minister fiercely defended the former Reserve Bank governor, Mr
S Venkitaramanan, saying he had 'done his duty well' despite the 'tremendous
pressure of the foreign exchange crisis' that India suffered in 1991.
Mr Singh insisted that neither he nor his ministry had been aware that the
funds that fuelled the artificial escalation of the Bombay stock market last
year came from banks 'in an illegal or clandestine manner' as suggested by
the investigating committee. The finance ministry found it hard to believe
the state bank of India would engage in such illegal activities.
Mr Singh rejected an allegation by investigating MPs that he had taken
credit for the stock market boom instead of action to regulate it. The
finance minister emerged from the gruelling afternoon of questioning looking
relaxed and saying that he had 'enjoyed every minute of it'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MAR'IE Muhammad, Indonesia's finance minister, said yesterday his
government planned to improve incentives for foreign investors in response
to increasing competition for capital from China, Vietnam and India.
The government is expected to streamline industrial licensing procedures,
extend the periods for which foreigners are allowed to lease land and
continue to liberalise the economy as a whole.
'We recognise that on a competitiveness rating we are now rather behind,
especially compared with China,' Mr Muhammad, appointed minister in last
month's cabinet reshuffle, said in an interview. 'We have to improve the
whole investment climate . . . We will do it soon.'
Investors have complained about corruption and bureaucracy in granting
factory licences in the provinces and have also urged the government to give
them more secure land tenure.
Economists expect the lease periods of 30 years normally granted to
foreigners to be increased to 50 years.
The authorities are anxious to maintain investment to provide work for 2.5m
people who enter the jobs market every year. Mr Muhammad said the government
would further deregulate trade and industry, and liberalise the hitherto
protected agricultural sector.
The government had set a target of between 5 per cent and 7 per cent
economic growth a year, the minister said.
Mr Muhammad also recognised investor concerns over the parlous state of the
banking system, dominated by state banks which are burdened with
non-performing loans.
'We have to improve the quality of their productive assets,' he said,
stressing the need for 'better management, especially in their credit
analysis, in monitoring outstanding credits - that's very, very important
and critical'.
New laws governing the capital markets are also being drafted, Mr Muhammad
said. Changes would allow foreigners to increase their holdings in companies
which have listed only a portion of their shares on the stock exchange.

FT  27 APR 93 / US calls for more cuts in interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday said that further interest rates cuts were needed in Europe
to boost growth.
Mr Roger Altman, the US deputy Treasury secretary, said the US welcomed last
week's reduction in the Bundesbank's discount and Lombard rates. He said
that the recent pace of reductions in European interest rates was 'good'.
But it hoped that the process of lowering European interest rates would
continue.
Mr Altman made his comments to journalists at the annual meeting of the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development after addressing the bank's
annual meeting.
His remarks suggested that that Germany could come under pressure from its
Group of Seven partners later this week to accelerate the easing of its
monetary policy. The G7 is due to meet on Thursday in Washington to discuss
the state of the world economy amid concern at the spread of recession to
Japan, Germany and other continental European countries.
Senior British Treasury officials said yesterday that the emergence of
recession to these parts of the world more than offset encouraging signs of
recovery in the US and the UK.
The officials also said the UK would press at this week's spring meetings of
the International Monetary Fund and World Bank for wage restraint in the
international financial institutions. The UK had been disappointed not to
win a majority on the IMF and World Bank boards to reduce this year's 6 per
cent pay increases at the two bodies.

FT  27 APR 93 / Attali promises change at EBRD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, East Europe Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACQUES ATTALI, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, yesterday promised he would 'carefully oversee rigorous
implementation' of new measures decided after two weeks of criticism which,
he said, 'had provided constructive lessons for the bank and for me'.
But the barrage of criticism continued after the opening speeches, with Mr
Viktor Geraschenko, Russian central bank chairman, adding his voice to
complaints about the EBRD's slow pace of disbursement. He decried the
'paltry' sum of Ecu6.3m (Pounds 4.97m) disbursed in Russia to date by the
bank.
Despite admitting that Russia's own unpreparedness was equally to blame for
slow progress, Mr Geraschenko criticised what he called the lack of 'Russian
specialists acquainted with the real conditions of the country'.
He called on the bank to go beyond investments in the energy and minerals
sector, and help foster investment in the conversion of military industries,
the agro-industrial sector and the development of 'healthy competition in
the banking system'.
By contrast, Hungary reflected the concern of the fast-track central
European countries to prevent Russia acquiring the lion's share of available
resources. Mr Ivan Szabo, finance minister, called for the EBRD to 'focus on
a manageable number of well-defined priorities'.
One area in which the bank has a new chance to demonstrate its practical
worth isof nuclear safety, which was raised by Mr Attali as a top priority
at the EBRD conference in Budapest last year.
The nuclear installation safety fund, to which more than Ecu100m (Pounds
79m) has been committed by 11 countries and the European Commission, 'will
be operational by the end of this week', Mr Attali announced. The first
project, for improving safety at the Kozloduy nuclear complex in Bulgaria,
will be submitted by the bank to the committee of donors next month, he
said.
Mr Attali also showed his penchant for the broader perspective by reminding
his audience that the Yugoslav crisis revealed the need for Europe's
diversity to be respected, and that, without stable institutions, the former
Soviet Union could be split into 15 nuclear powers.

FT  27 APR 93 / Worner presses Paris to take bigger Nato role
</HEADLINE>

FRANCE would have 'everything to gain and nothing to lose' by taking a more
active role in Nato, Mr Manfred Worner, the alliance's secretary general
said in Paris yesterday.
Before an audience at the National Assembly which included the French
foreign minister, the Nato top official clearly hoped that his impassioned
appeal for France to shake off its historic chilliness towards the alliance
would catch the Balladur government at an impressionable early stage in its
life.
Mr Worner brandished his 'European' credentials by noting that, as German
defence minister in the late 1980s, he had helped 'father' the joint
Franco-German brigade which the two countries hope to build into the
'Euro-corps' by 1995. But European defence efforts, he said, could not
possibly substitute for the US security link enshrined in Nato, which now
played an important role in establishing ties with Russia and east Europe
and in providing military and logistic support for United Nations
peace-keeping.
France need not reverse its 1966 decision to leave Nato's integrated
military command, Mr Worner said. It could follow Spain's example in keeping
its troops outside Nato in peacetime, but sending its defence minister to
Nato meetings to give the alliance 'the benefit of its (military) competence
and experience in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and in UN operations,' Mr
Worner flatteringly suggested, picking up an idea floated by Mr Pierre Joxe,
France's former socialist defence minister.
But Mr Alain Juppe, the new French foreign minister, was cautious in advance
of a new defence white paper later this year. He did, however, signal that
Paris might moderate its opposition to Nato extending its links eastward. Mr
Juppe conceded that the new states in eastern Europe were looking for their
security 'not to pan-European organisations such as the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), but to organisations such as
Nato which included the US'.

FURTHER evidence emerged yesterday of the fledgling recovery in the French
economy when a survey of small and medium-sized businesses showed that some
companies are starting to hire extra staff and to increase investment.
Small companies have borne the brunt of France's economic problems over the
past year as high interest rates have cut into corporate investment and
consumer spending. Until recently the mood of small businesses was
unrelentingly grim. But a new survey by the Sofres research consultancy and
Credit du Nord bank published in yesterday's La Tribune Desfosses, suggests
confidence is slowly improving.
The number of small businesses intending to hire new staff rose to 8 per
cent, against 5 per cent three months ago. The proportion planning to lay
off employees has fallen from 44 per cent to 33 per cent over the same
period. Some 17 per cent of companies said they would raise investment.
The pressure on the French economy has alleviated slightly since the arrival
late last month of the new centre-right government and the subsequent falls
in interest rates.

<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will adopt a more
decentralised approach towards helping the former communist countries of
Europe and the former Soviet Union develop market economies, Mr Jacques
Attali, the EBRD president, said yesterday.
Reporting on a closed meeting of the EBRD board of governors, Mr Attali said
this was a turning point in the bank's operations. It is intended to make
its activities more visible and understandable in the countries in which it
operates.
Instead of taking all decisions from its London headquarters, the EBRD would
establish local institutions, most probably in partnership with governments
or private sector companies.
It is likely that the new philosophy will be applied in policies to help
create small and medium sized companies in the former communist states.
Two plans will be developed in the months ahead.
A Dollars 300m (Pounds 195m) fund to be administered by the EBRD, proposed
at the recent meeting of Group of Seven finance and foreign ministers in
Tokyo. This would take equity stakes in small and medium sized enterprises
in Russia.
A national development bank for Russia. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance
minister and chairman of the EBRD board, suggested that this could be
modelled on the German Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau that helped in the
reconstruction of West Germany after the second world war.

FT  27 APR 93 / Corruption seeps into Russian politics: Allegations of
venality exchanged in run-up to referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RATHER than any of Russia's most pressing problems, corruption has become a
pathetic hostage to the country's political infighting, illustrated by a
stream of allegations in the referendum campaign.
The real question is not so much whether the charges levelled against
high-level individuals in the run-up to the referendum are true or not, but
whether the problem can ever be tackled as long as it remains a political
football, and as long as reforms to eradicate its causes are held back.
Corruption is all pervasive in Russia, encouraged by incomplete legislation,
a lack of political will and a failure quickly to remove assets, and
economic decision-making from state hands - or at the least to discourage
officials from stealing.
Having had their uses in the past as a tool to fight President Boris
Yeltsin's opponents, corruption allegations have been used most recently as
a weapon to get at the Yeltsin camp. Tomorrow Vice President Alexander
Rutskoi, a presidential hopeful who has said Mr Yeltsin cannot claim
decisive victory despite winning a majority in Sunday's referendum, plans to
unleash new charges of venal wrong-doing in high places.
A statement by the office of Prosecutor-General Valentin Stepankov accusing
Gen Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, of corruption just three days
before the referendum was also no accident. An ally of parliament in the
struggle with Mr Yeltsin, Mr Stepankov, who has done little to prosecute
graft until now, who has asked journalists to pay for interviews, and who
published a book on the coup leaders before they were even put on trial,
appeared more set on discrediting the presidential camp. The statement also
threatened to undermine the hold by Yeltsin allies over the armed forces at
a time when splits in the army could lead to civil war.
A week earlier, Gen Rutskoi, who claims he is loyal to the president but
opposed to his entourage, accused him of doing nothing to stop the
plundering of the country by an alliance of senior officials, civil
servants, and mafiosi. On Saturday, the government, without denying the
detailed allegations, countered that Gen Rutskoi had abused or distorted
material privy to him as head of an inter-governmental committee to fight
corruption, making it more difficult to investigate the crimes he had
mentioned.
Now that he appears to have won some kind of popular mandate to continue his
reform course, one of the most burning tasks facing Mr Yeltsin will be to
put together an effective strategy combining institutional and economic
reform to fight corruption. Although he is believed to be personally honest,
Mr Yeltsin has all too frequently reorganised efforts to fight corruption.
He has also been prepared to overlook violations by various local officials
to buy their political support. Mr Yuri Boldyrev, the president's state
inspector was fired last month after President Yeltsin complained that he
had caused 'too many conflicts' with local authorities.
Mr Boldyrev also said he had been under pressure to focus corruption
investigations on opponents of Mr Yeltsin, and that his requests for an
independent body capable of investigating crimes in the military had been
turned down.
Mr Mikhail Gurtovoi, head of the government's anti-corruption commission
before he was sacked and his commission dissolved in February, believes the
only solution now is to create popular militias. However, the tired Russian
people are unlikely to emulate Italian-style outrage against their
establishment. If they do rise up, however, Mr Yeltsin knows that it will be
a lot messier in Moscow than in Rome, hence the urgency of acting soon,
before it is too late.

FT  27 APR 93 / War weariness blurs Belgraders' vision / Finding residents
of the city more worried about the price of potatoes than the prospects for
peace in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ATMOSPHERE of confusion yesterday pervaded Belgrade, the Serbian and
Yugoslav federal capital, after Bosnian Serb leaders once again rejected the
Vance-Owen peace plan.
As Serbians faced the imposition of new United Nations sanctions aimed at
isolating the country, weary shoppers at Kalenic, the city's biggest
vegetable market, appeared more worried about the rising price of potatoes
than the future of the peace plan for Bosnia.
They praised the refusal of Bosnian Serb leaders to cave into western
threats of sanctions and military intervention. But most also claimed to
back the efforts of President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to persuade the
Bosnian Serb deputies to vote in favour of the peace plan.
No-one appeared to see any contradiction between the rejection of the peace
plan and the appeal from Mr Milosevic and his Yugoslav and Montenegrin
counterparts, who on Sunday warned the Bosnian Serb deputies: 'You have no
right to endanger the lives of 10m Serbs'.
Many Belgrade residents seemed uncertain about the first public division
between the interests of Yugoslavia, now comprising Serbia and Montenegro,
and Serb-held territories in other former Yugoslav republics.
'They are both right. Each from their own perspectives,' said Olga, a
67-year old pensioner. She denied there was any reason to resent Bosnian
Serbs because Serbia had to bear the brunt of the new sanctions regime. 'The
sanctions will be lifted when the west realises it has have made a mistake,'
she added.
While Belgrade inhabitants seemed confused, diplomats were also at a loss on
how seriously to take the apparent split between Mr Milosevic and Mr Radovan
Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader. 'It is the first visible fissure. But it
remains to be seen how deep and serious it is,' said one diplomat.
Most people backed the rejection of the peace plan. 'They made the right
decision. If America bombards us, we will defend ourselves,' said Milan, a
pensioner born in Srebrenica, the fallen Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia.
'They could not approve a plan that takes away everything that is ours with
one stroke of the pen,' he said. The proposed plan calls for Serb forces to
give up nearly half of the territory they have seized over the past year of
war.
Amra, a 25-year-old Moslem married to a Serb in Belgrade, said: 'I would
have given in. I would do anything for peace.' My parents are living in
Bosnia. I am scared for them amid the lies that no-one can live together any
more,' she said wheeling her year-old daughter through the park.
Reports that buses heading for Hungary were turned back at the frontier
yesterday also heightened fears among Yugoslavs of being cut off from the
outside world.

FT  27 APR 93 / Contours alter on the Vance-Owen map: Change is probably on
the cards for 'the only game in town'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Vance-Owen plan for Bosnia may never be declared formally dead, but few
observers still believe that it can serve unchanged as the basis for a
durable peace settlement, after its latest rejection by the Bosnian Serbs.
The funeral oration for the plan cannot be delivered for the simple reason
that the package of tougher international sanctions decided by the United
Nations Security Council, due to come into effect today, are linked to the
plan. The sanctions are specifically intended to force the Bosnian Serbs to
endorse the plan, as the result of pressure applied on them by their Serbian
'big brother' in Belgrade.
If the Security Council, or the US and its allies alone, should decide to
take military action, be it the selective lifting of the arms embargo to
help the Bosnian Moslems or air strikes against Bosnian Serb supply routes,
those measures, too, will officially have the same political objective.
In the well-worn phrase often applied to it by commentators, it is still the
only game in town, meaning that it is still the only official political
blue-print for a peace settlement, backed by both the United Nations and the
European Community.
Its defects are widely recognised. But so is the fact that these very flaws
are the result of the insistence by the international mediators, Mr Cyrus
Vance and Lord Owen, to preserve both an independent state of
Bosnia-Hercegovina and the virtual autonomy of its various ethnic groups in
regions which they traditionally inhabited. The result would be the
withdrawal of the Bosnian Serbs from much of the territory they occupy at
present, reducing the area allocated to them from 70 per cent of the total
to 43 per cent.
Those considerations are considered to be central to any peace settlement by
the international community, particularly given the Bosnian Serbs'
undisguised desire to submerge an independent state of their own in a
greater Serbia. But they have made it difficult to devise a viable
alternative project showing the same degree of impartiality or one which
could muster anything like the same international support as the Vance-Owen
plan has done.
Western opinion has tended to blame the Bosnian Serbs for all the plan's
setbacks during the many months it has been discussed by the warring parties
in Geneva and New York. But the question has often been asked whether, even
if the Bosnian Serbs had endorsed the plan, it was ever realistic to believe
that it could be effectively implemented or offer a durable solution to
Bosnia's complicated ethnic and political problems.
The viability of a state divided into 10 semi-autonomous provinces, many of
which are separated from others with the same ethnic composition, has always
been questionable. The policing of the borders of this jigsaw of cantons and
the freedom of movement along specially designated routes linking different
parts of the country, would be an extraordinarily difficult task. At a
conservative estimate it would require at least 60,000 UN peacekeepers to do
the job for an indefinite period. That could last at least two decades given
the bitterness felt by all the ethnic groups - Moslems, Croats and Serbs -
at the atrocities perpetrated against each other. And even such a large
number of UN troops might not be sufficient to prevent a renewed outbreak of
hostilities.
Even if the Bosnian Serbs can be forced by tougher international sanctions,
or military intervention, to reconsider their outright opposition to the
plan, it seems increasingly improbable that it will survive in its present
form. Given the mutual hostility between Moslems, Serbs and Croats, a
greater concentration of the various ethnic groups in homogeneous regions is
much more likely to be the long-term outcome of the Bosnian imbroglio than
the Vance-Owen map, however sophisticated and equitable it is on paper.

TWO LEADING German trade unions yesterday announced agreement on 9 per cent
pay rises for their east German members, just as tens of thousands of
engineering and steel workers started voting in a strike ballot on whether
to reject a similar offer.
The agreements by the chemical workers' union, IG Chemie, for 5,000 rubber
workers, and by the banking and retail workers' union, HBV, for 300,000 shop
workers, are likely to undermine the militant campaign by IG Metall, the
giant engineering union.
Steel and engineering workers were being asked to vote for all-out strike
action yesterday in protest at the unilateral abrogation of their pay deal
by Gesamtmetall, the engineering employers, which says it will force many
eastern members into bankruptcy.
The details emerged as Chancellor Helmut Kohl issued a call for urgent
negotiations in the engineering dispute, and then hastily withdrew it,
apparently for fear of being seen to interfere in the wage-bargaining
system.
The rubber workers' deal is the most embarrassing for the engineers, because
they have agreed to renegotiate a step-by-step contract for wage
equalisation with the west, and settle for a relatively modest 9 per cent.
The shopworkers, working in a sector which is far more resilient than
manufacturing, have accepted 9 per cent, but it takes them to 86 per cent of
western pay levels - above the 82 per cent level the engineering workers are
seeking.
The engineers have so far refused to accept a significant slowdown in their
step-by-step contract providing for pay to rise from 71 to 82 per cent of
western levels this year (equivalent to 15.5 per cent on current rates), and
reach 100 per cent next April. They have rejected a 9 per cent offer from
Gesamtmetall, the engineering employers' organisation.
The engineers' pay deal was originally the model for most east German
industrial workers, but the collapse of manufacturing industry in the
region, and fears over excessive unit wage costs, have persuaded others to
slow down the equalisation process.
Voting in the strike ballot began briskly yesterday, with IG Metall
officials insisting they would win the 75 per cent Yes vote necessary to
call an all-out stoppage.

THE WORLD began tightening the economic noose around the rump Yugoslavia
yesterday after Bosnia's Serbs defied international pressure and rejected a
United Nations-sponsored plan to end the civil war in Bosnia.
The self-styled Bosnian Serb assembly, which has no international
recognition, announced yesterday that it would reject the plan to divide
Bosnia into 10 ethnic provinces although sanctions on Yugoslavia were
certain to be stepped up.
The assembly rejected the plan in spite of a last-minute appeal from
Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic and his Montenegrin and Yugoslav
counterparts. The message warned the deputies gathered in the Bosnian
frontier town of Bijelina that they had 'no right to endanger 10m citizens
of Yugoslavia because of . . . some minor points'.
The US and France said they would take immediate action to freeze Yugoslav
assets, and last night President Bill Clinton said that the US and its
allies must come up with a 'stronger policy' on Bosnia. He said he hoped to
announce new US proposals shortly after discussions with Congress.
The tougher sanctions won support from Russia. The measures include a land,
sea and air trade embargo that will virtually isolate Serbia and Montenegro,
the remaining Yugoslav republics, from the rest of the world.
Within hours of the vote, other countries began to tighten the sanctions,
which have brought the Yugoslav economy to its knees since they were imposed
last May in retaliation for Belgrade's support for the Bosnian Serb war
machine.
As western countries scrambled to find a new diplomatic direction on Bosnia,
, Yugoslav and Serb leaders said they still sought to end the year-old civil
war through diplomacy.
In Bonn, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, called for the
reconvening of the EC-chaired Yugoslav peace conference - excluding the
warring parties - so that the west and its allies could agree on new moves
to bring peace to the region.
'We are not saying the peace plan has failed,' the German Foreign Ministry
said last night. 'If we said that, we would have to have an alternative, and
nobody sees alternatives. We are saying the plan is temporarily rejected.'
The participants in the EC peace conference, convened in London by the
British government last year when it occupied the chair of the EC Council of
Ministers, included the US, Russia, Japan and Canada, as well as Turkey,
Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the 12 EC member states, and all the countries
bordering Yugoslavia.
Mr Kinkel and Lord Owen, the EC peace envoy, both avoided any suggestion of
military action. Lord Owen said the price of cutting Serbian supply lines
might be too high if it meant an end to humanitarian relief for the civilian
population.
In Sarajevo, a UN official said Serb forces ringing Srebrenica were asking
150 Canadian UN peacekeeping troops to leave, saying it had not been
properly demilitarised as laid down in a ceasefire accord.
The official said the Serbs had not set a deadline for the withdrawal, and
emphasised that the UN had no intention of pulling out its peacekeepers.
The Serb demand came as Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader,
promised to allow free access to Srebrenica for UN relief convoys and French
aid doctors.
Foreign ministers of 52 Islamic countries meeting in Karachi, last night
adopted a resolution calling upon the UN Security Council to lift the arms
embargo on Bosnia-Hercegovina immediately and impose a blockade on Serbia
and Montenegro, writes Farhan Bokhari in Karachi.
They also stressed Bosnia's 'inherent right of individual and collective
self-defence' and urged the Council to take further appropriate measures
including authorisation of the use of force.
A session of the conference today will be devoted to securing monetary help
for Bosnia. Saudi Arabia yesterday announced a Dollars 20m donation.

<TEXT>
AN EAST German castle which contains 13 km of property registers for the
territory was severely damaged in an arson attack at the weekend.
The attack appears to have been a dramatic attempt to disrupt the
restoration of east German properties to their former owners, including
Jewish families dispossessed by the Nazis, and opponents of the former
communist regime.
Only a small proportion of the files was totally destroyed or severely
damaged by the fire and water - initially estimated at some 400 metres of
shelving, or about 3 per cent.
However, the entire collection will now have to be moved to other buildings,
causing new difficulties and delays in the very complex restitution of
property.
Most of the roof and floors of Schloss Barby, an 18th-century mansion near
Magdeburg, were burned out after the attack, which was started in eight
separate places, according to a spokesman for the justice ministry in the
state of Saxony-Anhalt.
'This was not just some individual pouring a little petrol in a remote
corner of the building,' Mr Thomas Ahrens, the spokesman, said. 'This was a
rather professional job, carried out in a sophisticated manner.'
It was impossible to say whether the arsonist or arsonists were motivated by
the desire to destroy individual files, or intended to disrupt the entire
property restitution, he said.
'It does not look like the work of a single person. Many people might be
annoyed at the whole process of restoring property to former owners,
although scarcely enough to try to burn down the entire land registry,' he
added.
The federal German government has insisted that, wherever possible, property
in the east should be restored to its rightful owners, and compensation paid
only as a second-best solution.
Opposition critics say compensation should be the norm, to prevent the
possible eviction of innocent occupants.
Before the latest attack, the staff at Barby had been inundated with tens of
thousands of requests for titles to properties confiscated before and after
the second world war.
They were expecting to spend years searching in files which had been stored
in damp cellars, and deliberately damaged by the Nazis to destroy evidence
of Jewish ownership.
The castle was once owned by Prince Heinrich of Saxony. Under the communist
regime in East Germany, it was used as a garrison for Soviet troops, then as
a hostel for migrant workers from Cuba and Vietnam, and since 1979 as a
top-secret registry under the control of the Stasi security police.

FT  27 APR 93 / Confusion pervades Belgrade as Serbs face new UN sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ATMOSPHERE of confusion yesterday pervaded Belgrade, the Serbian and
Yugoslav federal capital, after Bosnian Serb leaders once again rejected the
Vance-Owen peace plan.
As Serbians faced the imposition of new United Nations sanctions aimed at
isolating the country, weary shoppers at Kalenic, the city's biggest
vegetable market, appeared more worried about the rising price of potatoes
than the future of the peace plan for Bosnia.
They praised the refusal of Bosnian Serb leaders to cave into western
threats of sanctions and military intervention. But most also claimed to
back the efforts of President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, to persuade the
Bosnian Serb deputies to vote in favour of the peace plan.
No-one appeared to see any contradiction between the rejection of the peace
plan and the appeal from Mr Milosevic and his Yugoslav and Montenegrin
counterparts, who on Sunday warned the Bosnian Serb deputies: 'You have no
right to endanger the lives of 10m Serbs'.
Many Belgrade residents seemed uncertain about the first public division
between the interests of Yugoslavia, now comprised of Serbia and Montenegro,
and Serb-held territories in other former Yugoslav republics.
'They are both right. Each from their own perspectives,' said Olga, a
67-year old pensioner. She denied there was any reason to resent Bosnian
Serbs because Serbia had to bear the brunt of the new sanctions regime.
'The sanctions will be lifted when the West realises they have have made a
mistake,' she added.
While Belgrade inhabitants seemed confused, diplomats were also at a loss on
how seriously to take the apparent split between Mr Milosevic and Mr Radovan
Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader. 'It is the first visible fissure. But it
remains to be seen how deep and serious it is,' said one diplomat.
'It is extremely late in the game for where.'
But Jelena was a rare critic. Most people backed the rejection of the peace
plan. 'They made the right decision. If America bombards us, we will defend
ourselves,' said Milan, a pensioner who was born in Srebrenica, the fallen
Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia.
'They could not approve a plan that takes away everything that is ours with
one stroke of the pen,' he said. The proposed plan calls for Serb forces to
give up nearly half of the territory they have seized over the past year of
war.
'I would have given in. I would do anything for peace,' said Amra, a
25-year-old Moslem married to a Serb in Belgrade.
'My parents are living in Bosnia. I am scared for them amid the lies that
no-one can live together any more,' she said wheeling her year-old daughter
through the park.
Reports that buses heading for Hungary were turned back at the frontier
yesterday also heightened fears among Yugoslavs of being cut off from the
outside world.
Eleven months of UN sanctions, including an oil embargo, have created a
siege mentality amongst most Serbs. The sanctions regime has pushed even
pro-Western Yugoslavs towards anti-Western sentiment.

WESTERN countries scrambled for a policy direction on Bosnia yesterday after
Serbs in the republic rejected last-minute attempts to persuade them to sign
up to the Vance-Owen peace plan.
The Bosnian Serb assembly announced at dawn yesterday that it would reject
the plan to divide Bosnia into 10 ethnic provinces despite the certainty of
stepped-up sanctions on the last two republics left in Yugoslavia, namely
Serbia and Montenegro.
The self-styled assembly rejected the plan despite an appeal from Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic and his Montenegrin and Yugoslav counterparts.
The message warned the deputies gathered in the Bosnian frontier town of
Bijelina that they had 'no right to endanger 10m citizens of Yugoslavia
because of. . . some minor points'.
The refusal meant new United Nations sanctions took affect against Serbia
and Montenegro.
In Bonn, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, called for the
reconvening of the EC-chaired Yugoslav peace conference - excluding the
warring parties - for the west and its allies to agree on new moves to bring
peace to the region.
He put forward his proposal at talks with Lord Owen, the EC peace envoy, to
discuss the rejection of the Vance-Owen peace plan by the Bosnian Serbs.
'We are not saying the peace plan has failed,' a German Foreign Ministry
spokesman said last night. 'If we said that, we would have to have an
alternative, and nobody sees alternatives.
'We are saying the plan is temporarily rejected. The question is how we
proceed from here. We fear the atrocities will continue. The participants at
the conference - excluding the warring parties - must now decide what next
steps they will take.'
Lord Owen flew from Bonn to Copenhagen yesterday, where he was expected to
put the German proposal to the Danish government, now in the EC chair.
Mr Kinkel made it clear that he believed the Serbs should be put under 'the
most massive pressure' to stop their aggression.
Lord Owen described the Bosnian Serb proposal to hold a referendum in Bosnia
as 'perfectly obscene' in the light of their campaign of annihilation of
Bosnian Moslems.

FT  27 APR 93 / Slower rise in German inflation rate forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE underlying rate of west German inflation will slow 'relatively quickly'
as a result of this year's moderate pay settlements, according to a leading
Bundesbank official.
At more than 4 per cent, the current rate of prices growth was still
'worrying', Mr Otmar Issing, a member of the central bank's directorate said
yesterday.
But he made clear that the worries were not great enough to affect the
bank's policy of cautiously reducing interest rates, which continued last
week with the third cut so far this year. Inflation was a lagging indicator,
he noted, and as such was not suitable on its own as a guide for monetary
policy.
The internationally important discount rate, the effective floor for money
market rates, is now 7.25 per cent compared with its most recent peak of
8.75 per cent, reached in mid-1992.
Mr Issing's comments, which coincided with preliminary April figures from
four key states showing regional consumer price indices still rising by
between 4 per cent and 5 per cent annually, indicated that the bank is for
the present satisfied that the main controllable source of inflation has
been effectively dammed.
Pay deals averaging 3.5 per cent represented a marked reduction after rises
of 7 per cent in 1991 and nearly 6 per cent last year, Mr Issing said.
Commenting on a value-added tax increase in January which generated an
unwelcome surge in inflation, he said tax rises did not stem solely from the
authorities' need for revenue. They were also a consequence of high wage
awards in the public sector.
The braking effects of wage restraint on inflation were not felt
immediately, but basic developments were going in the right direction, Mr
Issing said.
According to most estimates, annual inflation rate will be down to 3.5 per
cent by this year's final quarter, by which time the Bundesbank is expected
to have cut its discount rate to around 6 per cent.
A severe housing shortage is maintaining upward pressure on rents, which
account for 18 per cent of the basket of goods and services included in
German inflation figures. However, recession and falling demand - the
federal consumer confidence index fell to a record low of 75.5 per cent in
March - leave manufacturers and retailers little scope for price increases.

FT  27 APR 93 / Fraud doubles in the Community: Common agricultural policy
proves the most tempting target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPORTED FRAUD in the European Community almost doubled in 1992, with the
common agricultural policy offering the most tempting opportunities,
according to a European Commission report released yesterday.
One in three cases involving abuse of the EC's farm export guarantee system
occurred in Italy, according to the report. France, Germany, and Britain
accounted for another third of these cases which cover false declarations
and abuse of EC support for sectors such as milk, milk powder, meat, oils
and cereals.
In agricultural funding, the number of cases reported by member states rose
last year by 616 to 820, at a cost of Ecu152m (Pounds 120m). The cases of
fraud occurring in areas such as customs duties and farm levies rose from
600 in 1991 to 1030 in 1992, at a cost of Ecu117.8m.
Two years ago, independent experts estimated that the EC was losing around
Ecu10bn a year to fraud. Yesterday, the Commission said only 10 per cent of
the money lost was ever recovered, largely because of the difficulties in
detection and lengthy prosecution in national courts.
The Commission also declared there was no reliable way of calculating the
level of fraud. 'Only one thing may be said with certainty: the scale of
fraud against the Community far exceeds the figures reported by the member
states,' according to a question-and-answer sheet made available yesterday.
The Commission paper suggests there is no such thing as a typical EC
fraudster; but in agriculture 'there does appear, broadly speaking, to be a
north-south division'.
In the north, large-scale fraud matches larger farm holdings; but in the
south, there were more cases of small farmers making fraudulent declarations
covering olive oil and other farm products, according to the paper.
Mr Emile Mennens, the Commission's senior anti-fraud official, said
Brussels' budget in this area would increase from Ecu76.5m (1992) to
Ecu133.2m this year, largely to ensure that the agreed reform of the CAP was
carried out by member states. But he stressed that the main responsibility
for tackling fraud remained with the individual EC members.
Mr Mennens added that new techniques were being introduced to fight fraud:
such as satellite photography to inspect 10 per cent of livestock and 5 per
cent of land every year. The Commission also plans faster exchange of
information among customs officials and tax officials in member states,
bolstered by new computerised systems.

FT  27 APR 93 / Italy's quiet civil servant steps into political arena:
Widely respected bank governor chosen to form government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS impossible to hear anyone speak ill of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the
72-year-old governor of the Bank of Italy.
The high personal esteem in which he is held by politicians of all parties
explains why Mr Ciampi was chosen yesterday in extremis to form Italy's 52nd
post-war government.
At a time of public concern over corruption, his integrity is beyond
question. And he has always been scrupulously neutral in his public attitude
towards the parties. As the epitome of a discreet civil servant his name has
cropped up on occasions either as a figure to head a 'super' economy
ministry or to head a government of technicians.
He has been reluctant to press his own candidacy. Partly, this is because he
is already close to retirement as governor after nearly 14 years at the
helm. In February he confirmed his desire to retire when asked about rumours
of his departure: 'If a person has been asked to stay on, it means that the
same person has requested to go.'
More importantly he lacks direct political experience. Since 1946, his
entire working life has been within the confines of the Bank of Italy, and
the world of central bankers. He has dealt with politicians at arms length
invoking the Bank of Italy's prestige as a bi-partisan institution and has
been instrumental in ensuring it has become fully independent.
Over the years, the politicians have all nodded reverentially in his
direction and then proceeded to ignore his advice on reigning in public
spending and tackling Italy's mountain of debt.
The tone of his public statements has as a result become increasingly
exasperated. Last May in his annual bank statement on the state of the
nation said bluntly: 'It is unacceptable that a society with a clear
awareness of the nature of the problems it faces, which has identified the
instruments and means of resolving them, defined its objectives, and has the
resources to achieve them, is incapable of translating this into action.'
He enjoys a strong personal relationship with President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro, which is likely to be a central factor in efforts to achieve a
consensus among the political parties on electoral reform. Both are of the
same generation, saw service during the war, experienced the founding of the
Republic and are devout Catholics. They also have summer houses north of
Rome near each other.
Mr Ciampi had hoped, like many from his native Livorno, to pursue a naval
career. Though invalided out because of problems with his eyes, his
conversation is full of nautical metaphors and he likes to run the bank with
the firmness of a ship's captain. He is going to need all this firmness.

FT  27 APR 93 / Yeltsin claims a convincing win in Russian referendum

<TEXT>
RUSSIAN president Boris Yeltsin yesterday claimed to have won a convincing,
if not absolute, victory in Sunday's referendum but his opponents
immediately dismissed the result.
Mr Yeltsin's office said he won 59.2 per cent support for his presidency in
the first 79 of Russia's 88 regions to tally results from the referendum.
Voters also backed the government's reform policies, with 53.61 per cent
declaring their support.
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the chairman of the Russian parliament, dismissed the
results and claimed the referendum had split society. He accused Mr Mikhail
Poltoranin, the Yeltsin aide in charge of the state-owned media, of
'Goebbels-style lies'.
While only a simple majority was required for the first two questions, Mr
Yeltsin failed to achieve the absolute majority required by the
constitutional court to call early parliamentary elections. Only 42.9 per
cent of the electorate of 106m supported early elections, with which Mr
Yeltsin would like to combine the introduction of a new-style bicameral
parliament foreseen by his draft constitution.
The results confirmed that he was more popular than the parliament, with
only 32.8 per cent of the electorate supporting early presidential
elections. Although aggregate results were not yet available, turnout was
reported by the Russian Information Agency as just above 60 per cent.
Mr Alexander Rutskoi, vice-president, another high-profile Yeltsin opponent,
said it was impossible to talk of 'overall popular support' for the
president.
Mr Vladimir Isakov, the co-ordinator of the parliament's hardline Russian
Unity bloc, said the results gave 'neither political nor moral ground for
any unconstitutional acts by the president'.
Mr Sergei Shakhrai, deputy prime minister and a key Yeltsin aide, said the
president would move swiftly to capitalise on the results. There would be a
cabinet shake-up on Thursday and a new constitution would be discussed with
leaders of the republics and regions this week before it was submitted to
parliament. If deputies refused to adopt the constitution, Mr Yeltsin would
call immediate parliamentary elections.
'There must be no cavalry charge but nor can the president sit on the
result,' Mr Shakhrai said. He stressed the need for rapid action in the
economic sphere, particularly on inflation.
Mr Yeltsin's support was at its highest in Moscow and St Petersburg, but
lower in the central provinces and rebel autonomous regions.
US president Bill Clinton telephoned Mr Yeltsin yesterday to congratulate
him and said he expected the outcome would make it easier to win Congress
backing for additional US aid.

FT  27 APR 93 / Increase in GDP signals an end to recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday reported the first significant rise in gross domestic
product for 2 1/2 years, confirming recent evidence that the country has
emerged from one of its longest recessions since the 1940s.
The Central Statistical Office said the UK economy grew by 0.2 per cent in
the first quarter of 1993, compared with the previous quarter. GDP was 0.6
per cent up on the same period a year ago.
Weak oil output in the first two months of 1993 meant non-oil GDP grew more
strongly. Excluding oil and gas extraction - 6 per cent of total GDP -
output rose by 0.6 per cent on the quarter, to stand 0.6 per cent higher
than in the same period of 1992.
This was the first significant rise in non-oil GDP for more than two years
and the first time since the second quarter of 1990 that both measures of
GDP have risen on the previous quarter.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, hailed the figures as the best evidence
yet of a broad recovery.
'We are beginning to see the fruits of all the difficult decisions I and the
government made over the last couple of years,' he said. 'We had to get
inflation down. We have got recovery underway.'
Mr John Major, the prime minister, seized on the recovery signs to renew his
call to industry to make the most of the 'unparalleled opportunities'
offered by the UK's low inflation and interest rates and a competitive
exchange rate.
The increase in GDP gave weight to other signs that the recession is over,
including three consecutive monthly rises in retail sales, an increase in
manufacturing output and strong narrow money growth.
A survey from the Institute of Directors yesterday showed that business
confidence among company directors has reached its highest level for five
years.
After peaking in the second quarter of 1990, GDP shrank by 3.9 per cent over
eight quarters to a trough in the second quarter of 1992. For the next six
months, the economy was stagnant.
In the 1979-81 recession, output fell by 5.5 per cent, but over only seven
quarters.
Excluding oil and gas extraction, the economy shrank by 3.8 per cent over
seven quarters from a peak in the second quarter of 1990, to a trough in the
first quarter of last year.
The preliminary figures do not give a thorough breakdown of where growth was
generated during the first quarter. However, the CSO said that manufacturing
output was estimated to have risen while energy production declined. Service
sector output rose 0.5 per cent.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said he hoped the recession was over
but added that skills shortages and an investment gap with the UK's
competitors could stymie future growth.

FT  27 APR 93 / Police seek more powers to combat terrorism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR police officers stepped up their calls for wider powers and greater
resources to fight terrorism yesterday as a series of arrests were made in
connection with Saturday's bomb, which devastated a wide area in the heart
of the City of London.
But the government refused to be pushed into a wholesale review of its
anti-terrorist policy in spite of concern in Westminster and Whitehall.
Downing Street said the government was determined to resist playing into the
terrorists' hands with a 'knee-jerk' reaction. Mr John Smith, the Labour
party leader, said: 'It is the duty of us all to show that this kind of
campaign will never succeed.'
Scotland Yard confirmed yesterday that a warning of a 'heightened threat'
was circulated to police the day before the City bomb. It refused to
disclose any details though forces throughout the country were reportedly
put on alert.
Yesterday, up to 20,000 City workers were either unable to work or were
relocated in temporary offices with only the barest facilities. Some of the
banks and other businesses worst affected by the blast had to take up space
in the offices of their competitors in order to get back to work.
Nevertheless, the Corporation of London, the City's local authority,
declared its efforts to get people to work were a success, with 'more than
90 per cent' of City workers able to carry on as normal.
Mr Owen Kelly, City of London police commissioner, said he wanted the
government to change the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to give
police greater flexibility to search vehicles on suspicion of terrorism. His
comments were echoed by senior Metropolitan police officials.
Police believe the act lays them open to civil action in cases where a road
check does not lead to a conviction. 'We think there is a case for relooking
at that legislation. It does reduce our effectiveness,' Mr Kelly said.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, did not respond to the comments, but said
London had given its response in opening financial markets: 'Today in the
City it's business as usual.'
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, emphasised his determination to tackle
terrorism but said there could be no guarantee against further bomb attacks
on the UK mainland.
Last night, police were trying to establish a connection between those
arrested - described as fewer than 10 men and women - and the weekend bombs.
The anti-terrorist squad said two men were seen hurrying from the tipper
truck containing the bomb, but the witness failed to get a clear view of
them.
Police were also studying video film from police traffic cameras and an
office security camera for clues. Although the images were not of sufficient
quality to identify the bombers, they confirmed that the bombers' vehicle
had been parked in Bishopsgate before 9am on Saturday.
Lord Inchyra, director-general of the British Bankers' Association, said the
effect of the latest bomb would be to 'increase insurance premiums, but
hopefully not to the extent that people will say the City is uncompetitive'.

FT  27 APR 93 / Attali under attack at EBRD meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACQUES ATTALI, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, was yesterday subjected to severe criticism from the countries
that had set up the bank.
In the opening session of the bank's annual meeting, governor after governor
admonished it to exercise better control over costs after recent reports of
extravagance in the fitting out of the EBRD's new London headquarters.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Theo Waigel, the German
finance minister and current chairman of the board of governors, delivered
only a light rap on the knuckles in the course of the opening ceremony. But
other ministers were more outspoken.
Representing the only country that had voted against the EBRD's
headquarters' budget, Mr John McDermid, the Canadian minister of state for
finance and privatisation, said the EBRD should set an example.
Fiscal restraint was essential if private sector development was to be
fostered in former communist countries, Mr McDermid said. 'Our public
institutions must play a part both as agents for change and as examples of
an appropriate role for government in economic development. In this
connection, EBRD must always be conscious of its responsibilities as a
public institution.'
Mr McDermid said it was 'essential for the bank to be a leader in promoting
efficiency and financial probity'. Canada would work with other members of
the bank and its management to ensure that expenditure was kept under
control, and 'if warranted, that appropriate remedial measures are taken'.
He said: 'Our taxpayers expect no less.'
Mr Roger Altman, deputy US Treasury secretary, expressed concern at reports
of extravagant spending at the bank. Later he told journalists it was clear
that some tightening of internal controls at the EBRD was required.
While he said the US believed the bank 'was doing very important work' and
that the US was 'not unhappy' with the bank, he failed to say the same of Mr
Attali when asked whether he would use the same words about the EBRD
president.
Ms Helle Degn, the Danish minister of development co-opera tion, who spoke
on behalf of the European Community, said the recent information on the
bank's spending had been 'a great concern for all of us'.
Mr Attali said recent criticisms had 'provided constructive lessons for the
bank and for me'. He recalled the bank had decided on some organisational
changes. 'I shall carefully oversee their rigorous implementation.'
Earlier, Mr Major had delivered a more coded message. After briefly praising
the EBRD for generating projects worth Pounds 7.9bn, he said that it must go
about its task 'in the most cost effective way possible, ensuring value for
taxpayers' money'. Mr Waigel said 'careful handling by the bank of the
resources entrusted to it was 'absolutely essential.'

price war in US
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
R. J. REYNOLDS, the domestic US tobacco arm of the R. J. R. Nabisco food and
cigarettes group, is to match the large price-cuts in full-priced cigarette
brands that its big rival, Philip Morris, announced earlier this month.
Reynolds said yesterday it would slash the price of its Winston brand by
Dollars 4 a carton, or 40 cents a packet. It would also apply 'increased
promotional activity' to its Camel brand, although it declined to be more
specific. 'Frankly, we'd like to stay light on our feet,' Reynolds said.
But the Reynolds cuts will apply to June only, and no other brands will
participate. The company said yesterday it would reassess in late June.
Winston is one of Reynolds' flagship brands and the one which competes most
closely with Philip Morris' Marlboro. Camel is also a non-menthol,
full-priced brand, although its total US market share, at around 4.1 per
cent last year, was smaller than Winston's, taking close to 7 per cent.
Philip Morris' decision to reduce the price of Marlboro, the best-selling US
cigarette brand, by 40 cents a packet (from around Dollars 2.10-Dollars 2.20
to Dollars 1.70-Dollars 1.80), sent the cigarette market into turmoil
earlier this month. Tobacco stocks plunged on the prospect of a ferocious
price-war in one of the most profitable consumer product sectors. Reynolds,
which has almost 29 per cent of the US cigarette market, against Philip
Morris' 43 per cent, said immediately it intended to remain competitive, but
had not previously detailed its response.
Philip Morris shares were Dollars  3/8 lower, at Dollars 46 3/4 , compared
with almost Dollars 65 ahead of its price-cut announcement. RJR closed at
Dollars 5 3/4 , against Dollars 8 before the price-war broke out.

<TEXT>
CHRYSLER, the US car manufacturer, has raised Dollars 100m by selling a
further tranche of its shareholding in Japan's Mitsubishi Motors to US
investors over the past few weeks, the company announced.
Chrysler said the sale of 15.5m shares left it with a holding of about 35m
shares in the Japanese vehicle manufacturer and cut Chrysler's stake from
about 5.9 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Chrysler has been gradually reducing its Mitsubishi stake as part of a plan
to concentrate financial resources on its own motor operation.
In March last year, Chrysler sold about 43.6m shares in the Japanese car
manufacturer for about Dollars 215m.
Chrysler said the company planned to sell its remaining Mitsubishi shares,
which are worth some Dollars 200m at current exchange rates, but had yet to
set a timetable for the disposal.
It said it may take a gain on the latest sale into its second-quarter
earnings.

FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Insurance costs expected to rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITY businesses could face big rises in insurance costs following Saturday's
bomb attack, even though the government is expected to meet a large part of
the bill.
Increases are almost inevitable because the cost of the damage is likely to
exceed Pounds 300m, exhausting available insurance funds of Pool Re, the
specialist reinsurer set up by UK insurance companies earlier this year to
cover terrorism risk.
Insurers will provide some reinsurance for Pool Re, with the government
guaranteeing all other claims.
'Unquestionably it looks like higher rates,' said Mr Alan Fleming, executive
director of the Association of Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and
Commerce (Airmic), which represents more than 300 insurance buyers.
Mr Tony Baker, public affairs manager for the Association of British
Insurers (ABI), also suggested increases were likely, with City businesses
bearing most of the burden.
Mr Fleming suggested it might become necessary to make the purchase of
terrorism insurance compulsory, possibly through the imposition of a
standard levy on all commercial insurance policies.
He said: 'The danger is that we will price some people out of the market. It
has to be paid for one way or another. The only solution is to broaden it.'
It also emerged that a number of insurance companies could be badly hit by
claims on policies sold before terrorism was excluded from covers. Royal
Insurance and others have reinsurance in place to protect these exposures.
But it is understood that some other companies are unprotected.
Business has had to pay more to protect itself from terrorist attack since
insurers withdrew cover from standard commercial insurance policies last
year after sustaining losses of more than Pounds 300m from last April's bomb
attack in the City.
Additional premiums for terrorist cover are collected by insurers and fed
into Pool Re. Pool Re meets all claims until its funds - relying on total
premiums of between Pounds 250m to Pounds 300m each year - are used up.
Insurers then contribute an additional tranche of cover equal to 10 per cent
of premiums collected by Pool Re. Beyond this level the government meets all
claims, acting as a reinsurer of last resort.
The DTI said yesterday the government would stand by these commitments even
though Pool Re has still not been authorised. Funds paid to it are being
held by insurers in specially earmarked accounts.
Even under present arrangements cover is expensive, especially for companies
in high-risk areas. The owners of a central London office block worth Pounds
100m in central London might expect to pay Pounds 50,000 for terrorism
insurance, according to the ABI.

FT  26 APR 93 / International Company News: Mitsukoshi slips into red as
sales fall 3.9%

<TEXT>
MITSUKOSHI, Japan's most famous department store yesterday reported a
Y2.16bn (Dollars 19.5m) pre-tax loss for the year ended February.
The company blamed the fall in consumption plus a shift away from the luxury
goods which Mitsukoshi is famous for. Mitsukoshi is facing tough competition
from a string of newer retailers.
The results reflect the difficulties which Mitsukoshi has had in cutting
costs in the face of a downturn in sales. It is bearing a heavy depreciation
charge for aggressive expansion in the late 1980s.
The Japan Chain Store Association yesterday reported that sales last month
were 4.6 per cent down from the year before, the seventh consecutive monthly
fall. The decline was led by a 34 per cent fall in sales of household goods.
Mitsukoshi swung from a Y10.9bn pre-tax profit to the Y2.16bn loss on a 3.9
per cent decline in sales to Y842.4bn.
Mitsukoshi said it would pay an unchanged annual dividend of Y6 per share.
It forecast it would move back into modest profit in the coming year.
Mitsukoshi's vulnerability to a fall in sales contrasts with Daimaru,
another department store operator, which reported a 23.2 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits to Y4.6bn on a 6.3 per cent fall in sales to Y569.8bn.
Matsukaya department store group reported pre-tax profits for the year to
the end of February fell to Y3.8bn from Y10.2bn in 1992 on sales of
Y491.3bn, down from Y501.9bn.
Nagasakiya, the leading supermarket chain, reported a consolidated pre-tax
loss of Y2.37bn in the year ended February, its first loss since listing on
the Tokyo stock market in 1963. It sales were 3.8 per cent down at
Y494.52bn.

FT  26 APR 93 / A dash of real Clintonomics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the first 100 days of Mr Bill Clinton's presidency the nation has heard
little of the 'people-based' economics that figured so prominently in
campaign speeches. You will recall the argument. In tomorrow's competitive
global economy everything will be mobile except labour. The relative
performance of nations will thus depend mainly on the quality of their
workforces.
President Clinton did talk about investment in people when he unveiled his
economic plan in February, but the ensuing debate focused mainly on the
merits (or otherwise) of his deficit-cutting proposals. Attention then
switched to the short-term fiscal stimulus, finally defeated last week by
Senate Republicans. The social issue monopolising everybody's attention has
been healthcare. Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton has a 500-strong army of
technicians working like slaves to produce a health plan sometime next
month; hardly anybody is steamed up about vocational training or science
teaching.
This crucial element of Clintonomics has been delegated to Messrs Richard
Riley and Robert Reich, respectively education and labour secretaries. Stiff
and somewhat inarticulate in public, Mr Riley hardly conveys a dynamic
image. But the tenacity with which he pursued educational reforms while
governor of South Carolina has apparently earned Mr Clinton's lasting
respect. Mr Reich, one of the original FOBs (Friends of Bill) and former
professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, does have the capacity
to sell new ideas. But whether either man will actually have much impact
remains uncertain.
In a newspaper column a couple of years ago, Mr Reich attacked fellow
Democrats for proposing only 'tiny, symbolic shifts' in Republican spending
priorities. Preparing the workforce for the 21st century, he claimed, was a
mammoth task requiring an additional public investment of Dollars 200bn a
year. It could be carried through only by 'the political equivalent of a
warrior like General Norman Schwarzkopf,' the Gulf war hero. Well, General
Reich is now in command, but unfortunately his president is proposing only a
tiny, symbolic increase in spending - about Dollars 10bn a year for all
educational and training reforms.
This is fortunate because correcting flaws in US education and training
mainly requires a change of attitudes and behaviour rather than masses of
extra cash. In real terms per capita spending on schools has risen more than
a third in the past decade. US companies spend about as much on training as
their counterparts abroad. So what do Riley and Reich hope to achieve with
the limited sums?
They set out their philosophy last week in a joint press conference. For a
British journalist there was a strong sense of deja vu. In effect, the
administration is adopting large chunks of the Thatcher reforms of the late
1980s. Building on the work of the Bush administration, Mr Riley is creating
a national council to oversee the introduction of new curriculum standards
and assessment techniques. As in the UK, the aim is to establish greater
central control over what is taught in schools and to devise tests that
effectively monitor the performance of both students and schools.
Mr Reich, meanwhile, is creating a national council (composed of
businessmen, educators and trade unionists) to oversee a new system of
vocational qualifications along European lines. Nearly a decade after
Britain, the US is waking up to the fact that its educational system is
geared almost exclusively to the needs of the minority who gain university
degrees. As in the UK, each stage of education is essentially a preparation
for more advanced education, rather than for life or work. Little or nothing
is done to ease the transition from school to work for non-academic
youngsters; there is no system of nationally-recognised credentials for
non-graduates.
Both moves could provide substantial long-run benefits. But the Clinton
reforms differ from Britain's in crucial ways. In the first place everything
is voluntary. On the school side, this was unavoidable because the US
constitution gives states primary responsibility for education. With federal
spending accounting for only about 6 per cent of school budgets, Washington
is like a flea trying to discipline an elephant. At best it can hope to
influence states by cleverly deploying the small carrots and sticks at its
disposal. The success of new vocational qualifications, meanwhile, will
largely depend on support from private business - which is by no means
assured.
The other big difference is that the administration is putting no emphasis
on increased competition between schools. Many reform-minded Democrats
believe that schools should be able to opt out of the often stifling
bureaucracy of local school districts (the US equivalent of local education
authorities) and receive funding directly from state governments. Mr Clinton
is not throwing his weight behind the idea partly because of opposition from
the teachers' unions, big contributors to the Democratic party.
Whether more 'choice' would greatly improve educational quality is as hotly
debated in the US as in Britain. But it is plausible to argue that a
freeing-up of any long-established system will offer potential benefits. At
the moment, the 'people-based' economics that supposedly lies at the heart
of Mr Clinton's strategy is looking decidedly tame.

FT  26 APR 93 / Slippery slopes of Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chorus of demands that something more be done to stop the interminable
horror of the war in Bosnia is becoming irresistible. The present United
Nations-sponsored policy, combining diplomatic persuasion, trade sanctions
and humanitarian aid, is obviously not bringing peace. And since the world
naturally turns to the US for leadership in a crisis, America's new
president is under growing pressure to respond.
Unfortunately, there are no easy alternatives to the present policy which
would be safe for us and which would make things better for them. All the
limited schemes currently being touted can only make matters worse. If we
seriously want to do something to stop the Serbs and end the slaughter,
there will be no halfway stopping point.
Arming the Moslems: The proposal that the outside world should arm the
Moslems seems to me indefensible on any grounds - political, practical,
humanitarian or moral.
In the first place, the UN would be forced to close down its humanitarian
aid programme. This would be a moral setback, unless we suppose the war
would end instantly. Second, I defy anyone to frame a UN resolution
endorsing such a policy - not just because the Russians would object, but
because it is inconceivable that the UN should actually promote a civil war.
By implication, the UN would be forced to get out of the peacekeeping
business, not just in Bosnia, but worldwide.
Should Britain, France and the US promote the supply of arms to the Moslems,
acting outside the UN and and in opposition to declared UN policy? Could
they prevent other countries from supplying the Serbs?
Such a policy would effectively turn a small war into a large war, with a
much more unpredictable end. Some claim that a large war would be morally
better because the sides might be more equally matched. But we cannot
predict the balance of forces; we only know there would be much more
killing.
Air strikes: Some people argue that the outside world must intervene
directly to compel an end to the war; they claim that this can be achieved
by precision bombing against Serb artillery, supply lines, or even the Serb
homeland.
Such arm's-length intervention would have three advantages: it is less
hypocritical than arming the Moslems; it acknowledges that any alternative
to the present policy must involve direct intervention; and it is unlikely
that western soldiers would be killed.
Unfortunately, the disadvantages are much greater. It is virtually
impossible that precision bombing in wooded mountain country can take out
enough artillery pieces, which are small and mobile, to make a serious
military difference. It is even less likely that it could stop the Serbs on
the ground, let alone make them sign up for the Vance-Owen plan, and then
surrender the vast excess territory they have conquered.
Moreover, western leaders would be then hooked on the undeclared logic of
military intervention. They would have denied that they were going to put
troops into Bosnia; but since bombing by itself must fail, they would then
face a painful choice between going back ignominiously, or going on to the
next stage, which is to put fighting troops on the ground. It would be
better if they spelt this out in advance.
Safe havens: Some people argue for a purely defensive intervention, to
create a safe haven for the Moslems. This might be militarily feasible, with
a few thousand troops, in limited areas such Sarajevo. But if the safe haven
were easy to set up, because it was limited to the Moslem heartland, it
would in practice define the future frontiers of a new minimal Moslem state,
which would be much more restricted than anything in the Vance-Owen plan. If
it were less limited, it would mean fighting the Serbs and Croats. We have
no reason to suppose that other outsiders would not then pile in on the side
of the Serbs, ostensibly for equally 'defensive' purposes.
The fundamental dividing line is between intervention and non-intervention.
But there is no way we can remain at arm's length for our own safety, yet
have the impact on the war that can only come from going in on the ground.
There is no safety net between limited intervention at the start and total
intervention at the end. This logic cannot be finessed, and the politicians
must not pretend that it can.
Second, there is no sense in talking about a military intervention without
devising, in advance, a political strategy to go with it. The seductive lure
of the arm-the-Moslems option is that it appears to exonerate us from
responsibility, though of course it could not protect us from the
consequences of such an incendiary policy. But any of the interventionist
options, however small at the start, must end inexorably with the sending of
troops.
I am not against sending troops. But what will they be sent to do?
The answer is, unfortunately, self-evident: it can only be to impose a
settlement on the whole of Bosnia, with or without the benefit of a peace
plan. There is no point starting down the road of military intervention
unless the objective is a comprehensive political strategy. That means that
governments must be prepared, in advance, to send very large numbers of
troops.
Personally, I should prefer to stick with the present policy, unsatisfactory
as it may appear. The dead and the dying are a daily horror; but every
single life saved is a life saved. But if governments are determined to
change tack, at the very least let them spare us the pretence that their new
policy will be safe and moral.

FT  26 APR 93 / Monday Interview: A star of the small screen - Howard
Stringer, president of CBS Broadcast Group, talks to Raymond Snoddy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY

<TEXT>
Howard Stringer's office in Black Rock, the New York headquarters of CBS,
has no shortage of the memorabilia you might expect to find surrounding the
president of a US television network. There is a display of Emmy awards and
a weighty bronze statue of a bronco rider, a gift from Burt Reynolds, star
of the successful CBS sitcom Evening Shade.
But, as the Coronation mugs and Welsh national flag on his desk suggest,
Stringer hardly fits the stereotype of a top American media executive. Born
in Cardiff and educated at Oxford, he served with the US army in Vietnam
before rising through the ranks of CBS.
More recently, the Welshman has proved himself American television's most
astute arbiter of taste, taking CBS's audience ratings from third to first
place in the 1991-92 season - the first time any network has made such a
jump in a single year. Its ratings supremacy was confirmed last week, with
CBS completing the 1992-93 primetime season with the highest overall
ratings, while increasing its number of nights with top ratings from two to
four.
'Two years ago NBC said that in two years there would be only two networks
and that CBS would be the one that would go away,' says Stringer with an
understandable sense of satisfaction. It is now NBC that is mired in third
place.
As president of the CBS Broadcast Group, Stringer is in charge of all the
company's broadcasting operations, a Dollars 3.5bn-a-year business which
includes the CBS network as well as wholly owned television and radio
stations.
But although he is the boss of a leading US corporation Stringer is just as
likely to be wooing the stars of rival networks as he is to be studying
balance sheets. In January, after a long courtship, the CBS president lured
away NBC's David Letterman, the popular late-night chat show host, in a deal
believed to be worth more than Dollars 40m.
Programming victories such as this are starting to translate into profits.
Last year CBS had pre-tax profits of Dollars 227m with only Dollars 14m
coming from the network, Dollars 170m from CBS television stations and
Dollars 21m from radio. This year Ms Jessica Reif, media analyst at
Oppenheim, the stockbrokers, is forecasting group pre-tax profits of Dollars
388.7m of which Dollars 170m will come from the network. This is despite the
disappointing ratings for the network's sports programming - an area in
which CBS has been criticised for overspending.
The genial Stringer, 51, has risen to the top at a sedate pace. At 30, when
he was a CBS television researcher, he was given the opportunity to produce
programmes, and the result was four prize-winning news documentaries.
His next big challenge was in 1981 when he was became producer of the CBS
Evening News, the network's main evening news programme, which had slipped
into third place, behind NBC and ABC. Within two years he had taken the
programme to number one, partly by resisting the trend towards short news
stories. It has since fallen back into second place.
Stringer rose through the CBS ranks during the 1980s, changing jobs every
two years as those above him - many brought in from outside the organisation
 -were fired.
'I had relationships and a sense of loyalty to the organisation that kept me
from being fired,' he says, although he concedes he came close to being
sacked when CBS was acquired by Mr Larry Tisch's Loews Corporation in 1986.
It was a time of rapid change and Stringer was not only one of the old guard
but as executive vice-president of CBS News he was in charge of one of the
big spending departments. When he accompanied Tisch on a train journey from
New York to Washington he saw it as a make-or-break occasion. Tisch promptly
fell asleep, which could have cost Stringer his one chance to get to know
the new CBS owner. But Tisch woke up in time to talk, found he liked his
employee and made him president of the news operation.
'Then I had to preside over the largest lay-offs in our history,' Stringer
laments. 'The company was in third place, the network was in third place and
news division was losing Dollars 50m-Dollars 60m a year.'
In response, he came up with new programme ideas which, together with
spending cuts, started to turn things round.
Stringer was happy as head of the news operation. But in 1988, at the annual
convention of CBS's affiliates - stations which take network programming -
he walked into the centre of a bitter attack on network executives. The
affiliates were in open rebellion over CBS's dismal ratings.
'For some reason I was the only one who decided to speak. I took on
everything and everyone,' recalls Stringer. Two months later he was head of
all of CBS with a brief to take the network out of bottom position. The
challenge was not only to increase ratings but do it while cutting costs. In
his first year, he cut Dollars 250m from the budget and had to push ahead
with another round of lay-offs.
How Stringer came to the CBS network in the first place is as remarkable as
how he came to run it. Born in Cardiff, he won an assisted place at Oundle,
the English public school, and went on to Merton College, Oxford, to read
history.
He was drawn to America by images of President Kennedy and his 'new
frontier' and a belief that England by comparison was a stuffy place. But
soon after persuading CBS to give him a clerk's job logging viewers
comments, he was drafted into the army.
'For three weeks I had a dilemma. Do I join the army? Do I flee the draft?
It was just stubbornness . . . I couldn't get on that plane to get out of
the country,' says Stringer, who returned from two years in Vietnam as a
sergeant with an army commendation medal. The experience, he says, has given
him a certain perspective on the corporate hand-to-hand combat of network
television.
He has pursued a dual strategy. As CBS president, his first aim was to
encourage stability and collaboration after the years of turmoil. He made
certain all eight CBS divisions worked closely with one another, and that
the corporate headquarters in New York and the entertainment headquarters in
Los Angeles had a strong, open relationship. He also installed good
communicators in senior positions. 'Whatever you could do in the 1980s,
there is no place for autocrats in the 1990s,' Stringer says.
In a more stable atmosphere he set about rebuilding his network's
performance by concentrating on winning individual programme slots one at a
time. On Monday nights, he brought in a hit programme called Murphy Brown, a
sharp-edged comedy starring Candice Bergen, and used it as a lead-in to
promote the rest of the schedule. On Tuesday nights he began showing popular
films aimed at a younger audience.
'It's really a question of consistently slamming home building blocks over
four years and when something doesn't work ditching it fast,' he explains.
Yet the battle for ratings among the four American networks - CBS, ABC, NBC
and Rupert Murdoch's Fox Television - is only one part of the challenge
facing Stringer and his counterparts in broadcast television. The
proliferation of rival cable and satellite channels - there are expected to
be as many as 500 within the next few years - threatens to erode further the
networks' audience share, which has declined by a third in the past 15 years
to just over 60 per cent.
Stringer, however, is relatively optimistic about the future. Technology may
create excitement but the networks, he believes, will continue to create the
bulk of original programming. On one recent Thursday evening between 9pm and
10pm, Stringer notes, the four networks got 90 per cent of the available
audience. The total network share of viewing, he says, increased marginally
last year from 62 per cent to 63 per cent and he believes the 60 per cent
line can be held.
Stringer has signed up for another four years at CBS at more than Dollars 1m
a year, but after that he may return to the UK. Last year he was sounded out
for the chief executive's job at ITV but he was not interested. If he was
offered the director-general's job at the BBC, it might be a different
matter. 'I wouldn't rule it out. But by then I'll be too old and probably
seen as too American.'

FT  26 APR 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Awaiting US GDP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH most of the price action in foreign exchange markets was in the
peseta crosses last week, the main focus for dealers may now move back to
the dollar, writes James Blitz.
At the start of the year, the markets were bullish for the US currency in
the first half of 1993. That optimism has now all but withered away, with
the dollar failing to break through the DM1.67 level against the D-Mark.
On Friday, the US currency fell to DM1.5770, a new low in the current cycle
 -and some analysts believe it is going lower still. Economic indicators in
the next few days will decide the dollar's near-term fate.
The most important indicator is the first quarter GDP figure, due out on
Thursday. There is little doubt that the economic upswing in the US in the
first three months of this year was more shallow than the one which took
place in the last quarter of 1992.
But Mr Gerard Lyons of DKB International in London is more pessimistic about
the figure than other economists: he thinks it will be around 2 per cent,
against market estimates of 2.6 per cent.
The Conference Board's consumer confidence figures, due tomorrow, will also
be keenly watched.
The market expects only a slight rise in confidence, of around 63.4 per
cent, compared to last month's Conference Board figure of 62.6 per cent.
In Europe, there will be a strong focus on the peseta, although economists
believe this is unlikely to have an effect on the structure of the ERM.
One factor which may help the peseta would be another cut in the
Bundesbank's repo rate on Wednesday. The sharp decline in German call money
in recent days, down to 7.62 per cent on Friday night, has made a repo rate
fall inevitable.

FT  26 APR 93 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Portugal (8):
AutoEuropa proves a magnet / A look at the progress of investment from
overseas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISCUSSION of foreign investment in Portugal over the past few years has
inevitably focused on the massive Ford-Volkswagen project, known as
AutoEuropa.
The largest foreign investment ever made in the country, AutoEuropa draws
attention not only because of its scale: a Es450bn project creating 5,000
jobs directly and another 10,000 indirectly. It is also proving a magnet for
other investments.
In a typical development, a 16-strong Spanish delegation seeking joint
ventures with Portuguese companies to supply the AutoEuropa project recently
visited the country. Other suppliers are moving in from Germany and other
European countries.
In addition, Portuguese companies are upgrading their quality standards to
meet the rigorous standards of Ford-Volkswagen in a process that is pulling
domestic industry into the 21st century faster than any series of government
programmes.
But AutoEuropa is not the beginning and end of the foreign investment story
in Portugal. Other projects have been attracted by the conditions that led
Ford-Volkswagen to select Portugal from hundreds of possible sites.
These advantages, according to Mr Miguel Athayde Marques, president of ICEP,
the body that promotes investment, trade and tourism in Portugal; include:
low overall costs;
low wage costs;
productivity to equal the best in Europe when workers are allied to modern
managements;
attractive EC-backed incentives;
rapidly improving communication and other infrastructures;
political stability;
the workforce with the best strike record in Europe; and
pleasant living conditions.
Another major investment in Portugal has recently been made by Pepsico Foods
International, which is to invest Es13bn (Dollars 90m) in setting up a
snack-food factory and an Iberian distribution network centred at Carregado,
some 50km north of Lisbon.
The project should be fully operational by 2002 and the first stage of
production will start shortly. Turnover, when cruising speed is reached in
1996, is expected to total some Es21bn, approximately 70 per cent of which
will be from the export market.
The construction of the new factory will lead to the creation of over 1,000
jobs directly as well as a further 600 indirectly. Pepsico officials say
that aim of the project is to integrate its operations in the Iberian
peninsula and that the site in Carregado offers several advantages over
other possible choices in both France and Spain.
The potential of the Portuguese market, where about 30 per cent of total
output will be sold, weighed heavily in Pepsico's decision as did the
development of transport networks and economic arguments that outweighed
Portugal's disadvantages of being further away from the principal demand
centres and the fact that the country has a less developed agricultural
sector and less up-to-date distribution facilities.
'This is an integrated project from farmer to consumer,' says Mr Cesar
Bardaji, president and general manager of Pepsico Inc in Portugal. 'Our role
starts on the farm, where we provide all the seed-potato technology that the
farmer requires - irrigation, cultivation techniques and even storage
requirements.'
'At the outset we considered the possibilities of France, Spain and
Portugal. The reason we decided on Portugal, in the end, was market
conditions: it's a market that's growing considerably and has great
potential.
'Also, we knew that the local authorities were greatly interested in the
investment and were prepared to grant assistance,' he says. 'One of the
factors that exerted the greatest influence on the Portuguese government was
the fact that the project provided a high level of employment and that it
was an integrated agro-industrial concern.'
The interest of the Portuguese government translated into sizeable EC-funded
investment grants that for contractual projects like the Pepsico enterprise
can reach 50 per cent or more of the total investment.
In a recent move to make contractual investment projects more accessible,
the government has halved the minimum qualifying investment for the
contractual regime from Es10bn to Es5bn. It is hoped that this will also
enable some larger domestic companies to qualify.
Neste, the Finnish group, also recently reached agreement with the
Portuguese government on a Es17bn project to make full use of the
comparative advantages of the Sines Petrochemical complex, less than 100km
south of Lisbon, where Neste already runs a petrochemical plant.
The contract envisages setting up a Methyl Ter Butyl Ether plant with a
production capacity of 45,000 tons a year. MTBE is a compound that replaces
lead in petrol, reducing pollution.
The project also includes increasing the production capacity of Neste's
high-density polyethylene plant from 80,000 to 120,000 tons a year and
enlarging and developing its polypropylene plant from 70,000 to 80,000 tons
a year. The highly capital-intensive project will create only about 40 jobs.
These major contractual investments get into the headlines. But it is small
and medium-sized investments and joint ventures that make up the bulk of
foreign investment in Portugal.
Even though both the Ford-Volkswagen project and the Pepsico investment were
authorised in 1991 - Neste was the only contractual investment made in 1992
 -and despite the international recession, direct foreign investment in
Portugal last fell only to Dollars 4.3bn from Dollars 5.5bn the previous
year.

FT  26 APR 93 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Portugal (7):
State asset sales face snags - Clouds over the government's future
privatisation programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSANNE RINDLISBACHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF EVENTS go according to plan, the weight of state-owned companies in the
Portuguese economy will cut by half during the current term of Mr Anibal
Cavaco Silva, the prime minister.
According to the 1993 budget, their contribution towards gross domestic
product should be no higher than 8.5 per cent by the time the general
election is due in 1995, compared to 16.2 per cent this year.
Other declared aims of the government's privatisation programme are to boost
capital markets and to strengthen domestic entrepreneurial groups, preparing
them for the impact of the single market.
Although the privatisation programme has been a success so far - at least in
financial terms - analysts warn that the future could be less rosy.
From spring 1989, when it began, to the end of last year, the total or
partial sale of 25 companies yielded Es676bn (Pounds 2.96bn). In 1993, the
finance ministry expects privatisation revenue of Es225bn, 20 per cent of
which will be channelled back into remaining state-owned companies.
Investors are critical that little else is known about the government's
privatis- ation plans. There is no official timetable, which the government
says depends on the state of the markets, and finance min- istry officials
are customarily tight-lipped about future privatisation plans in general.
In 1992, the government concluded the reprivatisation of the insurance
sector. This year, it is expected to sell its remaining assets in banks,
with the exception of the large Caixa Geral de Depositos and Banco Fomento
de Exterior groups, which will remain under state control.
Portugal's private financial groups are still busy establishing themselves
and one of their main objectives is to increase in size. This has ensured
that most privatis- ations in the financial sector have been a success. With
the possible exception of Banco Pinto e Sotto Mayor, which faces grave
financial problems, forthcoming sales in this sector should go smoothly.
The same cannot be said of the state- owned industrial sector where many
companies are seriously ailing. This has been seen in unprecedented
difficulties in selling off cement, steel and petrochemical companies.
This year's programme started on the wrong foot when the government failed
to find a buyer for the cement companies Secil and Cimentos de Maceira and
Pataias. It set a minimum price of Es59bn for its 80 per cent share in the
two companies. Only Portuguese-controlled groups were allowed to
participate. But the two domestic groups originally interested in the deal
backed out, complaining that the price was too high. The government is now
expected to open up the process to foreign groups in a second attempt.
After apparently missing the right time to sell the Siderurgia Nacional
steelworks, the government now faces the unpleasant prospect of having to
pay to sell this loss-making giant. Analysts said it was clear from the
start that SN could survive only as part of an international group.
However, the one group that has come up with an offer, the French-Spanish
Usinor-Sacilor joint venture, is reported to be interested only if the
government takes over SN's liabilities, estimated at Es60bn.
Portugal's largest enterprise, the oil company Petrogal, is proving to be
another complex and arduous case. The Portuguese media has suggested that
the government is considering declaring the sale of the first 25 per cent of
the company null and void because of a dispute with the purchasers, the
consortium Petrocontrol.
Petrocontrol - a group comprising domestic investors and Total of France -
is refusing to share the costs of a badly-needed Es40bn capital increase,
arguing that when it bought the 25 per cent share last year it had no way of
foreseeing the extent of losses Petrogal would make in 1992.
One need not envy Mr Jose Manuel Elias da Costa, secretary of state for
finance, who is responsible for the privatisation programme, his task. In
addition to the international recession, which has reduced the value of
companies, he has to contend with a constantly depressed domestic capital
market and with the increasing apathy of investors aware that the best
companies have already been sold. In addition, margins between fixed minimum
share prices and the highest bids have been practically non-existent.
In several cases the government has been accused of presenting the companies
it is putting up for sale in too favourable a light. Share prices have often
fallen following a privatisation, making small investors wary.
Domestic business groups complain of a lack of consideration for their
restricted financial potential compared to the power of foreign investors.
They claim that if the government were really interested in creating strong
domestic groups, it would not make raising as much capital as possible from
privatisations its first priority.
It has been suggested that one way of achieving this would be to privatise
more companies through direct negotiations or tenders instead of stock
exchange auctions, the method used in most privatisations to date.
The government has indicated there will be fewer auctions in future,
particularly in the industrial sector. However, officials are caught in a
double bind as they have been criticised just as strongly for imposing tight
restrictions on foreign participation as a means of protecting domestic
interests. The arguments here are that there is simply not enough money in
Portugal to guarantee the successful sale of all public companies and that
the government is distorting the market by imposing such limits.
These restrictions and the practice of revitalising state-owned companies
with public money prior to their sale have also provoked a complaint from
the European Commission.
Mr Elias da Costa sought to justify the limits on foreign participation in
talks with Commission officials in Brussels earlier this month. He argued
that only Portuguese assets were nationalised after the fall of the
Portuguese dictatorship in 1974 and that the decision to give priority to
domestic capital was a way of compensating for this 'injustice'.
While the Commission apparently remains sceptical, Mr Elias da Costa is
confident that the matter can be resolved without a lawsuit against Portugal
in the European Court of Justice. He says the Commission's reservations will
not interrupt or slow down Portugal's process of privatisation.
Companies that may be privatised at least partially this year include:
Banco Portugues do Atlantico; third phase;
Banco Totta e Acores, remaining 14.5 per cent;
Banco Pinto e Sotto Mayor;
Petrogal, second phase;
Secil and Cimentos de Maceira e Pataias;
Siderurgia Nacional;
Gas de Portugal;
Estaleiros Navais de Viana do Castelo, shipyard;
Portucel: paper, pulp;
Four bus companies belonging to Rodoviaria Nacional;
Part of the water distribution network.

Stumbling blocks still need to be overcome - Project Finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORTUGAL is enjoying an unprecedented era of infrastructure development. A
new 11km, Es121bn (Pounds 530m) bridge is to span the Tagus estuary at
Lisbon. A railway crossing will be added below the existing bridge - all in
time for 1998, the year when Lisbon hosts the inter- national exhibition
Expo 98 that will lead to a major facelift for the eastern side of the city.
In the power sector, a consortium led by the UK's National Power is paying
Electricidade de Portugal, the state-owned power company, Es183bn to take
over over the construction of two 300MW coal-fired power plants at Pego in
central Portugal. The deal could eventually extend to four units. Natural
gas is be introduced into the country and one, probably two, gas-fired power
plants will be built downstream.
The total cost of European Community and government infrastructure
development between 1989 and 1993 is estimated at Es3,500bn and a similar
sum is expected to be spent to the end of the century.
What distinguishes the above projects from the billions being spent on new
motorways, bridges, railway improvements and telecommunications is that all
are being financed by phenomena new to Portugal - project finance, in the
strict sense of private sector enterprise in which the cash flow of the
project is enough to pay back all the loans raised without recourse to
shareholders.
Previously, major infrastructure projects in Portugal were carried out by
giant state-owned enterprises and financed by loans to enterprises that had
the state guarantee of Portugal Inc. Government officials do not deny that
has led to the building of one or two white elephants.
'Following the wave of privatisations that Portugal has experienced it no
longer makes sense to farm out all the major projects to state-owned
companies,' says Mr Abdool Magid Vakil, chairman of the Lisbon-based Efisa
investment company. 'The government believes that, if it can get the private
sector involved, they will be much more careful and scrutinise everything
and in this way avoid the possibility of building another costly white
elephant.'
But so far Portugal's experience with project finance has failed to overcome
some initial stumbling blocks. 'It's a little worrying,' says Mr Filipe
Crisostomo Silva, a director of Banco Finantia. 'Portugal has been involved
in this for three or four years now and so far has failed to close one
deal.'
The first project to turn sour was the Es130bn plan to introduce natural
gas. The government called off two years of talks in March between an
international consortium led by Gaz de France (GDF) and EDP after the two
failed to agree on prices and risk-sharing.
'We would rather have no deal than a bad deal,' Mr Luis Pereira, Portugal's
energy secretary, said. He blamed GDF, saying it had expected EDP to take on
exaggerated risks. It had insisted on fixed costs that were too high and had
undermined the talks by reviving already agreed questions close to
negotiating deadlines.
GDF said it remained determined to bring off the project if only the points
in dispute could be overcome. The Portuguese government has set a deadline
of mid-May to decide on what route it will take to bring natural gas into
the country.
The difficulties leave a question mark over a 900MW plant powered by natural
gas that is being constructed in Portugal by a Siemens-led consortium -
which cannot be financed until there is a guarantee of natural gas reaching
Portugal - and over plans for a similar plant to be built by 2001.
'The failure of the gas project could be a bad precedent because project
finance lives off credibility,' says Mr Crisostomo Silva. 'International
banks have to trust in Portugal, in the stability of the Portuguese
government and the economic situation. When you start having problems like
the gas project, people might look at Portugal as an unsafe, unstable
country and resources may be diverted elsewhere.'
A project much nearer financial closing than the natural gas project is the
Pego power plant deal. But it, too, has been delayed. The closing was due to
have been signed on March 31 but problems arose in three areas: an EC
question over the competition status of EDP signing a 28-year exclusive deal
to purchase power from the plant and difficulties over both the contract for
coal to be unloaded and over the contract for rail delivery of the coal.
The finance package in place behind the Pego deal is as complex a deal as
any major international project finance agreement. It involves the issuing
of ordinary shares in Lisbon, shareholder loans, and two Deutsche Mark
non-recourse loans to be provided by two syndicates of banks. One is an
'offshore facility', the other a 'domestic facility' provided by Portuguese
banks.
Analysts predict financing the new bridge project will be even more complex
than the Pego plan. The main guarantee for Pego is the power purchase
agreement to be signed by EDP. In the case of the new bridge, which also
brings with it the concession for the existing toll bridge, many complex
factors have to be examined.
A list of eight international consortia for the bridge project has been cut
down to five and should be reduced to two before the end of the year. Their
proposals for the build, operate and transfer deal will have to take into
account how many cars will cross the bridge, what toll should be charged,
how soon can the consortium hand back the bridge to the state, what will be
the impact of the new rail crossing over the existing bridge and other,
difficult to assess questions.
'Portugal is learning from its mistakes,' believes Mr Crisostomo Silva, 'I
think you will now see the government waiting longer to choose the preferred
bidder and guaranteeing first that it actually has the banks and the money
behind it before going into detailed negotiations.'

The challenge of freedom - The opportunities for commercial banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANK lending rates for mortgages in Portugal have fallen from 24 per cent 18
months ago to as little as 14 per cent today.
This boost for home-buyers is just one signal of the new spirit of
competition that has taken hold among commercial banks, and of the
significant improvement in underlying fundamentals such as inflation that
has occurred over the past two years.
Released from the straitjacket of government-imposed credit limits and with
the process of privatisation in the sector close to completion, banks are
operating in a new atmosphere of freedom that is both an opportunity for
growth and a challenge to their creativity.
Despite the increase in competition and the squeezed margins that result,
banks, globally speaking, have fared well in this new environment that
brings them closer to the operating conditions of their European
counterparts. With a few exceptions, net assets and net profits grew solidly
in 1991 and 1992.
But 1993 will be a year of bigger challenges. 'This year will be relatively
difficult for the banking sector,' says a Portuguese banker. 'First, heavy
capital investments were made over the past two years to defend and expand
market shares when the sector was fully liberalised in 1993. These
investments will have to be amortised.
'Secondly, the banking sector will inevitably reflect the marked
deceleration of the economy as a whole.'
After two years of strong expansion and diversification of their credit
portfolios following the abolition of government credit restrictions, banks
will now be challenged to exercise constraint and be far more rigorous in
their risk assessment.
Credit problems are already growing at a slightly faster rate than credit
overall. But banks are not too concerned. One of the advantages of the
previous credit ceiling system is that the majority of Portuguese banks are
well capitalised. The two or three exceptions are all public with the
guarantee of the state behind them and are eventually likely to be
financially restructured.
A key area of attack for Portuguese banks in the less auspicious climate of
1993 will be costs. Higher financial margins in Portugal compared to the
rest of Europe tend to allow a higher ratio of costs, enabling banks to
accommodate inefficiencies that would otherwise not be tolerated.
With few exceptions, Portuguese banks are much more labour-intensive than
their European counterparts and investments in information technology are
more recent and often far from complete. Routine operations in a great
number of banks are still carried out by hand.
'In an environment of falling margins, the crucial objective is cost
control,' says Mr Joaquim Gomes, an analyst with Lisbon-based independent
stockbrokers Midas Investimento. 'Only by reducing the number of employees
per branch, installing information technology and generally growing lean and
mean can you assure a decent return on assets in these conditions.'
BCP, a classic success story in many respects, cannot afford to ignore its
difficulties on the cost side. A bank that has grown to the size of
century-old rivals in less than a decade, now with net assets of Es1,522bn,
BCP runs several networks for different sectors of the market and is
reputedly a text-book story of achievement studied at Insead, the French
based European institute of business administration.
'But when you've been growing at such a pace you're bound to pick up a lot
of fat,' says one Lisbon analyst. 'When you take it onto yourself to open 40
branches on the same day, you can't be too careful about costs. BCP could be
twice as big as it is now, without massive new investments or massive new
recruitment.'
Because they operate on a vastly different scale, other banks have grown at
a rapid pace without gathering so much fat. In 2 1/2 years, Barclays has
grown from three corporate offices in Portugal to a network of 65 retail
branches catering to medium- and high-worth customers. 'We have now built up
the critical mass to establish a viable project,' says Mr Joao Eduardo
Freixa, assistant general manager.
The Barclays system is based on margins of below 3.5 per cent,
cost-consciousness and a low staff ratio - branches are run by three to five
people. The project aims for a medium-term payback but cash flow has been
positive since the end of last year.
'The nature of our project is competitive interest rates and low delivery
costs to make them possible,' says Mr Freixa. 'I believe that is how the
business here is going. The margins of 5 or 6 per cent that some Portuguese
banks are working at will not be the margins of the future.'
Apart from the major Spanish banks, nearly all of which are aggressively
expanding in Portugal, Barclays is one of the few foreign banks in Portugal
to take the retail path, and as these have at least a two-year head start,
other banks seem unlikely to enter that market.
As margins shrink, another avenue that Portuguese banks will have to explore
is that of commissions. Banking services in Portugal have largely been free
because institutions were earning so much on their margins. Now a lot of
services that were free, from cheque books to financial intermediation, will
attract charges.
Banks will also have to become more expert at cross-selling, according to Mr
Gomes. 'It will be crucial for banks to turn what have been just bank clerks
into fully-fledged sales people, selling insurance, leasing and other
products at the bank counter,' he says. Only in this way will they increase
premium income to satisfactory levels and get an adequate return from the
financial groups they have been building up.

Novelty of a network in insurance / Profile of Banco Mello
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH PROVAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWLY-created Banco Mello is one of Portugal's smaller banks but its owners
believe it is poised to make an important impact on the financial sector.
The family bank has two major factors in its favour - it belongs to the
financially- astute Mello family and is being developed hand-in-hand with
the clan's other big asset, Portugal's top insurance company, Imperio.
'When we acquired the bank in May 1991, it was nothing more than a bank with
a licence and a team of people,' says Mr Vasco de Mello, the bank's
36-year-old president. 'We implemented a new strategy. 'We decided it was
important to change the bank's name - it was called Sociedade Financeira
Portuguesa - and adapt to a new culture,' he says. 'We wanted to be a market
player in corporate business, in personal business and in the capital
markets.'
One of Portugal's leading financial families before 1974, the Mellos saw a
left-wing revolution whittle away most of their wealth through
nationalisation. Mr Jose Manuel de Mello was one of the country's leading
businessmen in pre- revolutionary Portugal, controlling the largest economic
group, Companhia Uniao Fabril, which had interests in shipping, banking and
insurance.
The family dispersed after the 1974 coup and headed for more
financially-sound centres such as New York, London and Switzerland. But they
never quite turned their backs on their homeland.
Today, with a stable democratic government in office, the Mello family has
returned in force. The govern- ment, embracing capitalist ideals and a free
market ideology, has helped pave the way for their comeback. Through his
personal holding company, Uniao Internacional Financeira, the family
patriarch Mr Jose Manuel de Mello regained more than 90 per cent of SFP
shares when the institution was reprivatised in May 1991.
SFP, granted the status of a special investment company, was originally
created in 1969 by the former right-wing dictatorship as a public limited
company, mainly as a vehicle to support industrial and development projects
in Portugal and its African colonies, particularly Angola and Mozambique.
The group changed the name to Banco de Mello six months after the purchase.
Last November, Mr Jose Manuel further tightened his grip on Portugal's
financial world by regaining control of the country's largest insurance
company, Imperio, buying a 65.55 per cent stake at its reprivatisation.
For the past two years, the reorganisation of the Jose de Mello Group has
centred round the fledgling Banco Mello. Today the bank with a 204-strong
workforce has graduated from a small to a medium-sized institution and is
ready to climb further. The Mello family plans to use the already
established Imperio network, with its 700,000 clients and 80 branches, to
expand throughout the country, initially focusing on Lisbon and Oporto. 'The
main difference is in the concept of banking,' Mr Vasco de Mello explains.
'We aim to distribute in other ways rather than act like a traditional bank.
'Imperio changes our way forward dramatically,' he says. 'We plan to do the
opposite from other banks by devel- oping banking products to add to a
distribution network already there. It has a certain novelty - insurance
contributing a network for a bank.'
Mr Vasco de Mello, the eldest son of shipping tycoon Mr Jose Manuel de
Mello, says that there are clear similarities between Imperio and the bank
and the family decided it was possible to develop a joint distribution
network, using the physical facilities of Imperio, to get closer to a more
personal market.
Banco Mello, still the child of the financial sector of the Jose de Mello
Group, is just one aspect of an integrated group which is organised into
three main financial fields: banking, insurance and investment management.
The bank's cash flow for 1992 increased 14.8 per cent to Es1.9bn (Pounds
8.32m), while net assets jumped 72 per cent to Es92.4bn. However, owing to
large investments, mainly in personnel and information technology, net
profits were slightly down.
The group hopes to open three more branches by the end of June, with an
additional nine six months later. By the end of 1994 Banco Mello is expected
to have opened facilities in all Imperio branches.
Although banking comp- etition is intensifying and economic activity has
slowed, the group is positive about the development of the bank. It has the
advantage of knowing that Portugal's insurance market is expected to show
the biggest growth rates in the EC this year.
In 1992, Imperio remained the leading insurance company with a total market
share of 12.9 per cent. Net profits were up 8.2 per cent to Es690m while
cash flow increased 43 per cent to Es2.6bn. The group is moving into
chemical companies and shipping, as well as maintaining its presence in
financial services through Banco Mello and Imperio.
'History doesn't repeat itself, but there are opportunities,' says Mr Vasco
de Mello. 'We're just trying to develop those opportunities.'

Target is to exceed EC growth - The Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PORTUGUESE government may be perfecting a cure for a malady that makes
life miserable for finance ministers - the need to set macroeconomic targets
and the almost inevitable need to explain why they have not been met.
So it is with convergence - the effort being made by member states of the
European Community to raise the performance of their economies in order to
be able to form a monetary union by the end of the decade. Portugal, like
its neighbour, Spain, and a number of other EC members, has previously
published a series of inflation, growth and debt targets to guide
policy-making as monetary union approaches.
Unfortunately, not many of these targets are being met as Europe falls into
economic recession. In Lisbon, though, Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, the finance
minister, deals neatly with the problem. It does not matter, he argues, that
official forecasts of the country's economic growth this year have fallen
from, first, 3 to 2 per cent and, finally, to 1.75 per cent.
In fact, the minister does not even blanch at suggestions that Portugal's
GDP could grow at less than 0.5 per cent this year. What matters is that it
grows faster than the EC average. That way, even zero growth would imply
continued convergence if the rest of the Community were in recession.
'I don't want to harp on numbers,' he says. 'We believe we will continue to
grow by more than the rest of the Community.'
That confidence is crucial now. Portugal is being buffeted by some strong
winds. Critically for an export-led economy, its two biggest trading
partners, Germany and Spain, are either close to recession or in it.
And while inflation is falling - it currently hovers at between 7 and 8 per
cent - the government is committed to a stable exchange rate policy which
forces it to keep interest rates frustratingly high.
Economic growth may above the EC average but it is a far cry from the
buoyant late 1980s. Unemployment, while extremely low at just over 4 per
cent, is likely, economists say, to rise about 2 percentage points this year
and wages are going up at an average 9 to 11 per cent if you listen to
private sector analysts or, according to the finance minister, between 8 and
9 per cent.
Perhaps most worrying to the authorities, though, has been a series of
niggling problems with the escudo. This started during the currency turmoil
in Europe last autumn. While the currency weathered the initial storm quite
well, the Portuguese were forced into a 6 per cent devaluation last November
when Spain devalued. Ironically, the escudo quickly recovered after that but
was hit again in March by the resignation of the deputy governor of the Bank
of Portugal.
The affair was quickly and credibly explained away as so much political
theatre but the markets were not listening and have been doggedly testing
Lisbon's resolve. Intervention by the Bank of Portugal cost it 10 per cent
of the country's non-gold reserves in March. The central bank also chivvied
short-term interbank rates up from around 13 per cent to 25 per cent at the
peak.
Although Mr Miguel Beleza, governor of the Bank of Portugal, quite discards
the possibility that Portugal would, as Spain did to its discredit last
year, resort to capital controls to defend the escudo, he insists that 'we
can and we will use the instruments at our disposal (interest rates and
reserves)' to defend the escudo's parity.
Despite this resolve to hold the escudo within its current parity band in
the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, calming down
the markets, he concedes, 'has taken longer than we would have liked'.
Neither he nor independent economists believe the attacks will continue much
longer. Short-term rates have already fallen back to around 18 per cent and
the bank believes it has ample reserves - some Dollars 17bn - to fend off
attackers and to hold the escudo above Es93 to the D-mark.
Typically, both the Bank and the finance ministry rule out a Lisbon-inspired
realignment in the ERM, in which the escudo could gain a little
competitiveness. 'We believe exchange rate stability is crucial,' Mr Beleza
says.
Fortunately for Portugal, non-residents do not actually own many escudos but
the nature of the attack on the currency is changing and, believes Mr Rui
Martins Dos Santos, chief economist with Banco Portugues de Investimento,
perhaps becoming more dangerous.
Last autumn, the assault consisted of foreign institutions selling their
long positions in escudo securities. The volume of shares, bonds and money
market instruments in foreign hands has fallen from Es800bn last September
to Es350bn now. At almost the same time, worried Portuguese companies began
paying back foreign loans in order to borrow in escudos. First, though, they
had to borrow foreign currency to pay the original loans back, thus further
weakening the escudo.
Mr Beleza now sees the short positions that foreign institutions have taken
in the escudo as being much more problematic, potentially, for the central
bank. These positions are modest but he believes the Bank was wrong to
resort to an interest rate defence of the currency after the resignation of
his deputy. The fact that rates moved so quickly caught the market's
attention, he says.
'It was counterproductive. Predators can see the fear in the eyes of their
victims,' he says. 'It's better to have one or two sharks nibbling away than
to have a whole lot of blood in the water. That just attracts more.'
The sharks, if they care, will also have noticed recent pledges by the
government to pump about Es1,000bn into housing, agriculture and exporting
programmes over the next few years despite many proclamations in the past of
its fiscal discipline. Is the government's political nerve failing?
Its political programme will have an impact on the budget from next year -
though much of the total will come from EC transfers and includes the value
of land the government plans to give away. That may slow progress towards
convergence, but Mr Braga de Macedo is quick to point out that Lisbon's
convergence programme commits it to meeting only EC averages and not the
strict monetary union targets established in the Maastricht treaty.
Economists like Mr Dos Santos like what they see. 'Policy is becoming more
flexible,' he says. 'The government needs to pay much more attention to the
economy and forget a little about nominal convergence.'
How quickly these programmes put money into the pockets of construction
companies, farmers and exporters remains to be seen but both the finance
minister and independent analysts believe the current slump is different and
that Portugal is poised to make an important break with its economic past.
Mr Dos Santos argues that even if Portugal does slip into recession, it will
be this year and it will be short and shallow. Typically, Portugal would go
into recession much later than its main trading partners but the hope in
Lisbon is that, this time, it will recover along with the rest. But the
speed with which recession has overtaken Spain has clearly alarmed the
Portuguese and it may be that the 'last in, first out' conjecture is just
wishful thinking.
'Our great concern is to avoid the impression that there is nothing we can
do in the crisis,' says the finance minister. 'This time we have a
medium-term strategy in place and the economy continues to show a resilience
which the government hopes will enable it to pick up with the rest of
Europe. Our cycle is always late and we need to hold on until recovery
occurs.'

Why the minister stepped in - Government 'interference' at the central bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jorge Braga de Macedo, Portugal's forceful finance minister, looks almost
hurt when asked if he might not have had just a tiny bit to do with the
resignation of the deputy governor of the Bank of Portugal in March and the
subsequent attack on the escudo in the foreign exchange markets, writes
Peter Bruce.
He does not quite put his hand on his heart and say 'Who, me?', but neither
does he apologise for any trouble he might have caused.
On Thursday March 11 Mr Braga de Macedo made a speech taking the bank to
task for not paying attention to the needs of what he called the 'real
economy' and for not playing a forceful enough role in lowering interest
rates. Mr Antonio Borges, its popular deputy governor, immediately resigned
in protest at the minister's 'interference'.
At one level, the affair probably assumed more importance than it deserved.
Mr Borges has not explained exactly why he left and it is assumed by some
market operators in Lisbon that he may have been looking for a suitable
excuse to leave the bank any way.
The most ominous result, though, occurred in the foreign exchange markets,
where the escudo immediately came under pressure, dropping to Es94 to the
D-mark at one point. In the absence of a clear explanation, the pressure
persisted.
It forced short-term interbank rates up from around 13 per cent to 25 per
cent at one point and, in March, intervention to support the currency cost
the Bank of Portugal about 10 per cent of its non-gold foreign exchange
reserves.
However, the important question surrounding the affair may be whether the
minister was, indeed, trying to interfere with central bank policy and, if
he was, to what extent was he damaging the Bank of Portugal's reputation as
an independent institution?
The bank's credibility is central to the growth of Portugal's financial
markets and its banking industry. The prospect of it becoming fully
autonomous under the monetary union rules of the European Community holds
out a vitally important promise of monetary stability for tiny Portugal.
The present government has already overseen an important transfer of
autonomy to the Bank of Portugal. It is no longer obliged to finance the
government (by underwriting treasury bills) and, says Mr Miguel Beleza, the
governor, while it could if it was thought appropriate, 'we have not thought
it appropriate for the last two years'.
For the moment, though, exchange rate and interest rate policy are made in
conjunction with the government, meaning, probably, that the finance
ministry has the final say.
But, assuming the EC's efforts to forge a monetary union remain on track,
the Bank of Portugal will become its own master, fully autonomous, before
the end of the decade. It will (so the theory goes, at least) control
monetary policy and remain the main regulator of the country's financial
system.
This may have been where the finance minister stepped in. He says he was not
trying to force the bank to cut official interest rates but to get it to
persuade commercial banks to narrow the vast gap between their prime lending
rates and the high rates that small businesses have to pay for loans.
'The Bank of Portugal could do more to explain how the economy works in a
time of change,' he says. 'It is part of forming a consensus.'
The minister sees this political role for the central bank as an extension
of four key structural measures taken by the government in the last few
years to drag the country's financial system into the late 20th century:
The end of the bank's obligation to finance the government.
The start, last December, of full convertibility of the escudo.
The decision to enter the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS last year.
New banking laws which open the sector to full competition.
By explaining 'how the economy works', Mr Braga de Macedo means that the
bank should become involved in debates on how the banking system should
respond to the crisis sweeping small and medium-sized businesses as the
country teeters on the verge of recession. 'Consensus is important,' he
says. 'If we are incapable of responding rapidly to the crisis we will find
ourselves still at the bottom while others are recovering. There is a great
deal of work for everyone to do.'
Is this interference? On balance, it probably is. The question is whether it
is interference in the bank's monetary policy role, or in its other task as
a regulator. More likely, it is the latter. Even after full autonomy is
granted to the central bank, it is unlikely to include banking regulation,
where the government will still have the power to make banking law.
The issue has implications for the approaching independence of central banks
in Spain, France and elsewhere in the EC. If a central bank cannot be told
how to behave as a guardian of monetary policy once full autonomy is
achieved, will governments then try to follow Mr Braga de Macedo's lead and
implicate their central banks, through their continued exposure to
government as banking regulators, in the implementation of policy?

PORTUGAL has a history of arriving late for recessions. In the 1970s and
1980s, the Portuguese economy boomed when the rest of Europe suffered. But
then it sank into crisis, just as its peers began to celebrate recovery.
This time round, Lisbon's centre-right Social Democratic government is
determined not to repeat the pattern.
As a small, open economy, Portugal is being tinged by the recession that is
gripping most of its European Community partners. But the government is
convinced that however low growth in Europe dips, Portugal can keep its head
above the crowd.
Portugal may again be the last to fall into recession, government officials
say, but it is determined that it will also be the first to climb out.
Why in past decades did Portugal feel the full brunt of recession when other
countries were enjoying an economic comeback? The answer, according to Mr
Jose Braga de Macedo, the finance minister, is that profligate governments
threw money at problems and lost control over budget deficits.
This time round, he says, things will be very different.
Structural measures have been taken to stimulate the competitiveness and
product- ivity of the economy, a tightly- controlled public spending
programme focuses on investment and keeps budget deficits from eating into
economic growth, and a social pact should help keep wage rises moderate, he
argues.
'We have the resilience and the policies to hold on until the recovery comes
and then take full advantage of that recovery,' he says.
Portugal today is working to a markedly different set of economic and
business rules than when it was dragged down by recession in the 1970s and
the 1980s. EC entry came in 1986 and with it the support of a massive inflow
of structural funds and later a strong commitment to economic and monetary
union.
This goal led to the development of a 1992-95 convergence plan, Quantum II,
that set annual targets aimed at bringing inflation, public debt and budget
deficits down to EC averages. The election of Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva as
prime minister of a majority government in 1987 brought political stability
and business began to be able to plan medium and long-term strategies.
Low wages and high growth rates, well above the EC average, attracted an
important inflow of direct foreign investment.
The late 1980s were rosy years of expansion for Portugal when gross domestic
product growth peaked at 5.2 per cent and capital investment climbed at
rates of more than 15 per cent a year.
But, at the same time, as Portugal became more tightly locked into the EC -
the Community today accounts for 75 per cent of Portugal's foreign trade -
so the risk of being caught up in Europe's misfortunes grew. Recession began
to cast its shadow across Portugal as darkly as elsewhere in Europe.
Shaken by the aftermath of the Danish vote against ratifying the Maastricht
treaty, some economic commentators in Portugal began to predict disaster,
warning that their country was too small and too exposed to escape the
recession afflicting their neighbours.
The government originally forecast 3 per cent GDP growth for 1993 but has
since revised that figure down to 1.75 per cent. This contrasts sharply with
what some independent analysts predict. Mr Rui Martins dos Santos, chief
economist at Banco Portugues de Investimento, for example, estimates growth
at zero to 0.5 per cent.
But this is a numbers game in which the finance minister refuses to get
tangled up. 'What is important is not exactly how much we grow but that we
grow more than rest of Europe, to ensure that we are continuing the catching
up process,' he says.
'As long as we are growing faster than the rest of the Community, we are
dampening the effects of the foreign recession,' he continues.
'If the EC grows 2 per cent and we grow by 3 per cent, that is one thing.
But if Community growth is zero, then reaching just 1 per cent is much,
much, harder. If EC growth is negative by, say, 0.5 per cent then just
reaching zero growth would be absolutely wonderful.'
But in the bleak climate currently facing Europe, what makes Portuguese
officials so sure they can escape all but a smidgeon of recession this time
and come up smiling as soon as European growth re-establishes itself?
Lisbon believes it has learned from the mistakes of some its EC partners and
put the right structural measures in place at the right time. 1992 brought
tax harmonisation, placed the escudo in the exchange rate mechanism of the
European Monetary System and saw the beginning of the reform of the public
administration.
Last December the escudo become fully convertible when the Banco de
Portugal, the central bank, lifted all restrictions on currency
transactions. Risk capital funds to support private investment are being
made available by both the public and private sector.
Competition in a newly- liberalised financial sector has been stimulated by
a new banking law and the virtual completion of a sweeping privatisation
programme.
The result has been a drop in corporate interest rates and more attractive
and flexible cash-management services.
The government has sharply cut its borrowing needs, raising a considerable
amount of funds abroad and freeing up credit for the productive sector.
Earlier this year, the government announced a series of EC-supported
packages worth more than Es1,100bn (Pounds 4.81bn) to support housing,
agriculture, export diversification and other areas.
'These are structural programmes that are exactly the opposite of throwing
money at problems,' insists Mr Braga de Macedo. He says they are contained
within medium-term plans for control of budget spending. Their aim is help
the Portuguese economy pick up quickly when the European recovery comes.
The government is confident that it can take the European recession in its
stride. But there is ample room for it to stumble. 'If there is a breakdown
in one economic policy, all the interlocking architecture of the govern-
ment's macro-economic policy could come tumbling down,' says Mr Miguel
Namorado Rosa, chief economist of Banco Comercial Portugues.
The commitment to a strong escudo, preventing lower interest rates, in a
context of a marked deceleration of economic activity, is considered the
weakest link in the policy chain.
How well could the government withstand a recession? Low unemployment,
currently less than 5 per cent, would help lessen the shock and the threat
of unemploy- ment would almost certainly moderate wage claims.
Politically, the government is in a strong position. While it could suffer
losses in local elections scheduled for December, the next general election
is not due until October 1995. The opposition Socialists do not appear to
have the strength to force an early poll, even if the economic situation
seriously deteriorates.
Were Portugal to escape the recession, that would be a boon as it struggles
to catch up with its richer EC partners. Ironically, the know-how for doing
so may come from peering quietly over the fence to see where the country's
more advanced partners have gone astray.

FT  26 APR 93 / International Bonds: UK companies hit the US private
placement trail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK companies are flocking to the US private placement market, attracted by
the ready availability of long-term funding at relatively favourable terms.
Last week saw the announcement of a Dollars 116m US private placement for
Lucas Industries, the engineering group. The deal, which has a 6.95 per cent
coupon and 12-year maturity, comes hot on the heels of similar placements
for the Vinten Group, HP Bulmer, and Hunting. Corporate advisers expect more
UK borrowers to follow suit.
UK companies say there are advantages in using the US private placement
market. 'Interest rates in the US are at their lowest in nearly two decades,
so you can lock into low fixed rate financing which is very attractive,'
says Mr Richard Green, financial director at Vinten. The group, a camera
mountings and systems, surveillance and electro-optics company, raised
Dollars 40m of 10-year money this month. It is paying a coupon of 6.72 per
cent to the US institutions which hold its bonds. By comparison, Mr Green
estimates the company would have had to pay at least 7.52 per cent for fixed
rate dollars in the UK.
As important as the low interest rates is that companies find it easier to
borrow long-term (from seven years up to about 15, depending on the
borrower) in the US private placement market.
That UK companies have turned their attention to the US market reflects the
lack of suitable borrowing opportunities on their own doorstep.
Many of the UK names which have followed this route point out that they have
little alternative to obtain long-term financing. The pricing on bank loans
has risen over the past three or four years, reflecting new controls on
capital and concern about the creditworthiness of borrowers at a time of
recession.
HP Bulmer, the cider group, raised Dollars 25m of seven-year money and
Dollars 20m of 10-year money recently. Mr Michael Ward, group finance
director, says: 'We wanted a source of long-term funds. Currently there is a
lack of preparedness by the UK clearing banks to extend over three years, so
if you are looking for five- to seven-year money you have to be prepared to
pay a very high price.'
Mr Ward points out that he would expect to pay a margin of 75 basis points
over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) for loans of between three
and five years, and 'quite a significant premium' for loans of over five
years.
Mr Green says there is more flexibility in terms of covenants with a US
private placement than with straightforward bank lending.
In his view, the tight UK covenants - which set out the limits on financial
ratios such as gearing - could prevent a company from making acquisitions
which in the longer term would help to lift its profits.
While some of the bigger, blue chip names can tap the Eurobond market for
longer-term financing, this route is not open to less renowned credits.
'Companies below the double-A rating level can't access the Eurobond market
easily,' points out Mr Stephen Schechter, managing director at Wertheim
Schroder.
Lucas's long-term credit rating was recently downgraded by IBCA from A - to
BBB+. Mr Edward Freeborn, Lucas's director of corporate finance, admits that
given the current credit rating 'it would not have been as easy' to go to
the Eurobond market as to the US private placement market. Others, such as
HP Bulmer, do not have a credit rating so would not be able to tap the
Eurobond market, or else are too small in size. 'We have a market
capitalisation of about Pounds 200m and pre-tax profit of about Pounds 13m .
. . certainly for us a Eurobond would be out of the question,' points out Mr
Dennis Clark, finance director of Hunting.
Proceeds from US placements are often used to refinance more expensive debts
at lower rates. Hunting has used proceeds from its Dollars 50m US private
placement to replace its existing dollar borrowings at lower rates, while
the proceeds from its Dollars 35m seven-year placement have been converted
into floating and fixed rate sterling. Lucas plans to use the proceeds of
its bond placement to refinance its short-term debt, although it swapped
proceeds from an earlier private placement into floating rate dollars and
sterling. HP Bulmer chose to swap its long-term dollar borrowings into
floating and fixed rate sterling to give effective 10-year funding at a
margin over Libor of less than one percentage point.

FT  26 APR 93 / Risk and Reward: Plotting a safe course along the yield
curve as the slope changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS official German interest rates were reduced last week, the D-Mark yield
curve took another lurch towards the sort of positive slope that the bond
markets have been awaiting for some time. If short-dated bonds are set to
outperform longer-dated ones, what are the most effective ways of taking a
position to benefit from the change in the months ahead?
The longer end of the yield curve has swung considerably, with the spread
between five and 10-year yields lurching up as the curve has become
positive. According to some, there is still a long way to go. Mr Jeremy
Hale, fixed income economist at Goldman Sachs in London, points out that the
differential between five and 10-year yields has shifted more slowly that in
other interest rate cycles, suggesting there is a sharper swing to come.
Simply buying short-dated paper has had one big disadvantage: the relative
lack of duration (the life of the bond, taking into account both the
maturity date and the timing of coupon payments) of short-term paper makes
it less price sensitive as interest rates fall. Why pay more for a
higher-yielding bond if it repays anyway in the near future?
One answer has been to move out along the yield curve towards the five-year
area, picking up duration without losing the relative outperformance of the
short end of the yield curve. Also, banks have used the swap markets to
structure instruments specifically aimed at investors wanting to take a
position on the shape of the yield curve. These have sold well in recent
months, though could prove expensive if the curve fails to steepen as
sharply as many investors expect.
This year has seen the issue of more than DM6bn of reverse floating rate
notes, which pay investors a higher return as interest rates fall, according
to Deutsche Bank. The buyers of this paper were almost exclusively German
retail investors.
As expectations of falling interest rates have grown, these instruments have
progressively offered less of a return: the first issues paid 14 1/2 per
cent a year minus the London Interbank Offered Rate, a level which had
fallen to around 12 1/4 per cent minus Libor by the time the flow of paper
began to dry up a month ago.
Medium-term notes specifically structured for investors looking to play the
German yield curve have been produced in abundance in recent months.
Typically, the redemption price of the paper is linked to the fall in
short-term interest rates: the sharper rates fall, the higher the redemption
price.
Mr Paul Abberley, a director of Lombard Odier Investment Management, the
London-based arm of a Swiss bank, said his firm had used such paper to
extend the duration of its D-Mark investments while keeping its exposure to
the short-term end of the market. Such notes bought by Lombard Odier had
been issued by institutions such as the Halifax Building Society and the
Republic of Ireland.
'As recently as a year ago, this type of investment was very innovative  -
no one much in London was doing it,' he says. US investment banks have more
recently been marketing the idea hard both to issuers and investors, and
making considerable headway.
Such swap-based products have a cost, of course - both the market spread,
and the profit margin of the bank that constructs them. As a Deutsche Bank
official says: 'Most of our bigger investors can reproduce these in the
market by taking out a number of swaps.'
Most investors still prefer to focus their efforts on getting the direction
of the market right, rather than on innovative investment products.

FT  26 APR 93 / UK Gilts: Inflation news helps ease the recovery blues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE gilt market shrugged off the economic recovery blues, but is thought
susceptible to further attacks of this debilitating illness in the weeks
ahead.
The first sign of this could come as early as today when the Central
Statistical Office announces figures for growth in UK output in the first
quarter. Should this lead to the first hard evidence that the UK recession
is over, watch out for cries of alarm from the gilt market which could
affect this Wednesday's big gilt auction.
Last week's rash of economic data gave further signs that a slow upturn may
be on the way, a development that gilts traders reckon could kick off a
spurt in inflation and bring a halt to the run of cuts in UK interest rates.
The biggest concern on this score came on Thursday when long gilts lost
nearly half a point on news that UK unemployment fell last month for the
second month running. The 26,000 fall in the March job queues, after a
revised 25,500 reduction in February, arrived with other indicators from the
car and housing sectors pointing to a pick up in demand.
At the end of a week of promising economic data, the government said shop
sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent in March compared with
February, and were 4.1 per cent higher than in the same month a year ago.
However, by the end of the week gilt investors had perked up, on the grounds
that inflationary trends were more favourable than these straws in the wind
would indicate. Pointing in this direction was that average earnings growth
dropped again in February to a year-on-year 4.5 per cent from 4.75 per cent
in January, the lowest increase for 25 years.
For manufacturing, the rate dropped 0.25 percentage points to 5 per cent,
while for the services sector average earnings dropped to 4.25 per cent,
compared with 4.5 per cent.
The figures on wage inflation came after several months in which wage
increases have been severely dented, and indicated that a take off in
earnings demand may be some way in the future.
Business Strategies, a consultancy, and Gallup, a market research group,
weighed in with a joint report saying the recession was still not over and
that consumer confidence in the first quarter of this year was less than the
far from high levels in the same period a year ago. The survey estimated
that consumer spending grew by a minuscule 0.1 per cent in the first quarter
compared with the final three months of last year.
A third pointer was Friday's release of monetary data showing a Pounds 1.2bn
fall in bank and building society lending last month. Indications from the
retailing industry, meanwhile, are that consumers are still some way from
spending more money in the more luxurious end of the food sector, a sign
that any upturn may be extremely slow.
Sentiments sparked by this kind of doleful news pushed life into the gilt
market on Friday, with long gilts regaining much of the previous day's loss.
While yields on 10-year gilts changed little on the week, those on
short-dated bonds were pushed up by up to 10 basis points on the week. This
was on the assumption that the UK government was unlikely to be in a hurry
to cut base rates, in spite of the surprise reduction in German interest
rates during the week.
The size of the government borrowing requirement will for some time send
shudders through the market, with the record Pounds 9.5bn deficit for March
underlining theories that borrowing for the current financial year could top
the Pounds 50bn mark. The outcome of this Wednesday's auction of Pounds 3bn
of 7.25 per cent bonds due 1998 will be a good guide as to underlying demand
for the instruments. Many gilt investors fear that the bonds' value may fall
over the next two years should the more extreme worries about the build up
of government debt turn out to be accurate.

FT  26 APR 93 / Swedish Government Bonds: Riksbank cautious in spite of
market cheer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Swedish bond market had plenty to cheer about last week and yields ended
Friday on a firm downward trend. The cut in German interest rates, a
fiscally tight budget package and reduced political uncertainty contributed
to the positive mood.
Given this and the recent strength of the krona, the decision by the
Riksbank, the central bank, to cut its marginal rate by a mere 0.25 of a
percentage point to 9.50 per cent after the market closed on Friday seemed a
little miserly. Dealers had expected a reduction of at least half a point,
the round of European rate-cutting which followed the Bundesbank's
announcement on Thursday. The Riksbank is taking a cautious line to enhance
the credibility of Swedish monetary policy, indicating that further
adjustments will be in 0.25 per stages.
'We are keen to show the market that we do not intend to pursue a policy of
aggressively lowering interest rates,' said Mr Thomas Franzen, Riksbank
deputy governor
The bank's policy is based on the over-riding importance it attaches to a
strong currency and the fight against inflation. However, Mr Bengt
Svelander, senior bond deal at Consensus Fondkommission in Stockholm, points
to a difference of perception between the bank and the market. 'The market
believes the krona will get stronger as the economy gets stronger with lower
interest rates. The bank is still concerned that it is only interest rate
differentials which are preventing the currency from weakening,' he said.
Nevertheless, most bond dealers expect the marginal rate to fall to 8.75 per
cent to 9 per cent in the next few weeks, giving a much needed stimulus to
the recession-hit economy. One prediction suggested the rate would be as low
as 6.5 per cent early next year.
Bond prices are discounting further interest rate cuts, with the yield on
the benchmark 1020 bond, due 1997, closing at 8.38 per cent on Friday, down
6 basis points on the day and 33 basis points on the week. Yields on
longer-dated bonds were falling, with the 1033 bond due 2003 ending the week
at 9.19 per cent, a drop of 30 basis points since the previous Friday.
The budget figures produced last week caused few surprises, as large savings
had been signalled in the main January budget.
The market appeared to have discounted the government's gloomier short-term
economic predictions, which suggested gross national product would fall by
1.7 per cent in 1993. Even a prediction of a SKr190bn budget deficit for the
1993-94 year, equivalent to 12.9 per cent of GNP, and a SKr255.3bn borrowing
requirement failed to disturb sentiment.
What the market liked about the budget was its emphasis on heavy spending
cuts in the next five years to eliminate the structural budget deficit. By
disclosing a further SKr81bn in savings for the 1994-98 period, the
centre-right minority government has announced cuts of about SKr160bn since
it took office in September 1991, equivalent to 10 per cent of GNP.
Equally positive was the backing given to the budget package by New
Democracy, the political party that holds the balance of power in the
Swedish parliament. This suggests an end to the political uncertainty which
has unsettled sentiment in recent weeks.
Yet the market reaction could hardly be described as ecstatic for two
reasons. First, there are doubts about implementation, given that most of
what is being proposed is scheduled to take effect after the next election
in September 1994, which may bring the opposition Social Democrats back to
power.
Second, there is a feeling that government forecasts on inflation and
economic growth over the next few years might prove over-optimistic, and
hence upset its calculations. The aim is to limit annual inflation to 2 per
cent to 2.5 per cent while achieving GNP growth of about 3 per cent a year
between 1995 and 1998.
The inflation forecast seems optimistic. Sweden is a country which is
associated with the problem. Since the krona was floated last November it
has weakened by nearly 20 per cent. Hence a large influence on bond market
sentiment is likely to be the progress of the current round of wage talks.
Evidence of low settlements will probably push yields down further.

FT  26 APR 93 / US Money and Credit: Clinton's Congress defeat shrugged off
by markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE killing of President Bill Clinton's economic stimulus package has
injected some fresh political anxieties into the US credit markets, though
these were hard to discern in last week's directionless trading pattern.
Mr Clinton suffered his first large defeat in Congress on Wednesday when
Democrats abandoned his much-vaunted economic stimulus package in the face
of a prolonged filibuster by an unexpectedly united Republican Party.
The setback, combined with the new administration's clumsy handling of
several other issues, raises questions about Mr Clinton's ability to push
through Congress the more important items on his legislative agenda,
especially large cuts in the federal budget deficit.
Failure to cut the deficit would be very bad news for the credit markets,
since it could stoke inflationary pressures and increase the supply of
government paper, thus tending to put downward pressure on bond prices.
However, the markets took Mr Clinton's defeat in their stride, with the
benchmark 30-year Treasury issue ending the week at a yield of 6.79 per
cent, just four basis points higher than the 6.75 per cent of seven days
earlier.
There are several reasons. First, the new administration is on a steep
learning curve and Mr Clinton is expected to learn from his strategy
mistakes over the stimulus bill.
Second, the credit markets were opposed to the stimulus package as
potentially inflationary, even though in its final Dollars 16bn form it
would have had minimal impact on the direction of the economy.
Third, the consensus Wall Street view of the economy presents a benign
backdrop for bonds: the US is expected to remain in a slow but sustainable
expansion, with both real gross domestic product growth and consumer
inflation for the year likely to be around 3 per cent.
These assumptions will be tested on Thursday when the Commerce Department
releases its report on first quarter GDP, which will show a sharp slow-down
from the 3.7 per cent and 4.7 per cent growth rates recorded in the last two
quarters of 1992, possibly to around 2 per cent.
The slow-down was underscored on Friday when the government released
statistics showing that orders for durable goods fell 3.7 per cent in March,
the biggest decline in 15 months and more than Wall Street had been
expecting.
However, both these figures and those for first-quarter GDP will have been
distorted by the severe storms which disrupted business activity in the
middle of last month, and the underlying economic picture seems rather
healthier than the GDP figures are likely to suggest.
Wall Street should get a clearer view of the momentum in the first week of
May, when the first statistics for April are released, and these could
propel the market out of its narrow trading range.
The market remains prone to inflation scares - the weakness of
interest-sensitive share prices and the strength of gold prices last week
has some analysts warning of a build-up in inflationary pressures - and
signs of an April bounce-back could unnerve bond traders.
The first week of May will bring details of the Treasury's refunding plans
for the month, as well as the results of a government study into the mix of
maturities that make up the federal debt.
The new administration has been considering a shift of emphasis from
long-dated to shorter-dated instruments, although Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the
Treasury secretary, repeated last week that nothing radical was planned.
Even so, the market has been subject to speculation that the government may
not auction 30-year bonds in May, which has been one of the factors keeping
yields steady over the past week.

FT  26 APR 93 / International Company News: Court gives go-ahead to Marriott
bond group

A US court has declined to dismiss the fraud suit brought by certain
bondholders of Marriott Corporation, against the hotel and food services
group. The bondholder group is led by PPM America, the Chicago-based US fund
management arm of Britain's Prudential insurance group.
The controversy centres on Marriott's plan to demerge its
financially-healthy lodging business, leaving behind a company which retains
the property assets and the bulk of the group's large debts.
The PPM-led bondholders alleged that Marriott sold them debt securities in
the spring of 1992, when it knew of the plan. Marriott, which announced the
plan last autumn, sought to have this suit dismissed.
Judge Aexander Harvey, in the US district court in Maryland, denied to
dismiss four counts of the complaint but dismissed a fifth count. This
allows the PPM-led bondholders to go ahead with the pre-trial 'discovery'
process.

FT  26 APR 93 / International Company News: Packer, Murdoch in joint
satellite TV licence bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TELECOM Australia, the government-owned telecommunications carrier, has
joined forces with News Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's US-based media
group, and Mr Kerry Packer's Channel Nine television network to bid for
Australia's first satellite television licence.
If the bid is successful it would establish Mr Packer, proprietor of the
Consolidated Press Holdings media group, as the dominant force in Australian
commercial broadcasting. It would also mark the return to Australian
broadcasting of News Corp, which controls 70 per cent of daily newspaper
circulation through its News subsidiary.
The consortium said other investors might join the consortium before the end
of the week - the bidding deadline for two four-channel satellite
broadcasting licences being offered by the government.
Australia's two other commercial television broadcasters are believed to be
seeking a role in satellite television, as are a number of US media groups,
including Time Warner, Times Mirror and the Los Angeles Times.
Independent Newspapers, the Irish newspaper and a subscription television
group run by Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of Heinz, the US food manufacturer,
have expressed a wish to become involved.
The inclusion of Telecom gives the consortium significant technical
flexibility if problems emerge in the development of the digital
transmission system which will be a condition of both licences.
The formation of the consortium clears the way for a US-based bid for the
second licence, which was reserved for new entrants in an attempt to reduce
the concentration of Australian media ownership.
The uncertainty about the shape of subscription television services adds to
confusion about the future of the John Fairfax Holdings newspaper group, the
main competitor to News Corp.
The government agreed last week to allow The Telegraph, Mr Conrad Black's UK
newspaper group, to increase its shareholding in Fairfax from 15 per cent to
25 per cent to 'safeguard' its investment.
In spite of its small shareholding, The Telegraph has management control of
the group, which publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, The (Melbourne) Age,
the Australian Financial Review and Business Review Weekly.
Mr Packer recently acquired 10 per cent of Fairfax, but is unable to launch
a takeover bid unless he reduces his controlling stake in the Channel Nine
network to less than 15 per cent.
An article published last week referred to Mr Dan Colson as deputy chairman
of The Telegraph. In fact, Mr Colson is vice-chairman of the board. The
deputy chairman is Sir Frank Rogers.

FT  26 APR 93 / International Company News: Empty first class on All Nippon
Airways - The response to dwindling domestic demand at the Japanese airline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All Nippon Airways, Japan's largest airline and one of world's biggest,
suspended for one day its first class service on its London to Tokyo flight
last Sunday because there were no fee-paying first class passengers. On its
Tokyo to Sydney route it has discontinued first class. And on its
recently-launched Tokyo to Shanghai service it has decided to offer only
business and economy class.
ANA has been hit by the turmoil in the international airline market as well
as at home by the downturn in the Japanese economy. 'We've seen a big
decline in first and business class passengers of between 10 per cent and 20
per cent depending on specific routes,' said Mr Isao Yagi, the airline's
corporate planning director. 'As a result we are thinking of discontinuing
first class service on certain routes,' he added.
The rationalisation of the airline's first class service is only one
relatively small aspect of a broad series of measures ANA is undertaking to
adapt its operations to difficult times. Although the airline remains one of
the few big international carriers to remain profitable, it expects net
earnings for the year ended March, 1993 to have fallen to about Y3bn
(Dollars 68.5m) from Y7.6bn in 1991-92.
Profits are likely to come under even greater pressure during the next two
years. 'We are going to make the maximum effort to achieve another Yen 3bn
profit next year but it's going to be tough,' Mr Yagi said.
The airline's shareholders are expected to approve in June the appointment
of Mr Seiji Fukatsu as ANA's new president and chief executive. Mr Fukatsu,
head of the airline's domestic Air Nippon subsidiary, will take over from Mr
Akio Kondo, who is to become vice-chairman.
The new chief executive is expected to place the emphasis on
rationalisation, unlike Mr Kondo, who presided over the airline's
international and domestic expansion during the past 6 1/2 years.
Senior ANA officials acknowledged that the costs of Japanese carriers have
been too high.
However, they explained it was virtually impossible even in hard times to
adopt the same sweeping approach to restructuring and job cuts as airlines
in other parts of the world.
ANA has established a task force to study ways of improving efficiency,
cutting costs while increasing revenues in the difficult climate. Senior ANA
managers indicated that cost saving measures could include the hiring for
the first time of lower cost foreign cabin attendants and a reduction in the
traditional annual intake of new trainee recruits. It has started relocating
headquarters staff to sales and marketing tasks to strengthen the airline's
marketing and sales operations.
'We are also trying to contract out some of our functions and have postponed
the delivery of some new aircraft on order,' Mr Yagi explained. ANA is
cutting back its 1991-95 capital expenditure plan from Y1,300bn to Y1,000bn.
It is resorting increasingly to leasing rather than purchasing aircraft. The
airline is considering trimming its dividend.
The aim of ANA officials was to improve competitiveness by reducing costs
close to the level of rival US carriers. However, they conceded it would be
difficult to bring Japanese costs down to those of other Asian carriers.
The strategy is likely to slow down the rate of the airline's international
expansion. ANA, whose operations have been centred in Japan where it has a
53 per cent share of the domestic market, started expanding into the
international market in 1986.
With a network covering 18 international destinations, Mr Taiji Kameyama,
ANA's head of international relations, said the company's international
route expansion was complete. The next step will be to increase the
frequency of services on some of these routes. In the shorter term, the
airline sees the biggest potential in the Asian and especially Chinese
markets.
The company is slowing down the expansion of its international hotel
business and has suspended plans to open a hotel in London.
The airline's strong presence in the domestic market has helped it weather
the downturn better than Japan Airlines, its rival which relies on
international services for 70 per cent of its business. But growth has
slowed down in the Japanese airline market after averaging about 10 per cent
a year during 1985-90.
'For the first time since 1985 we had a small decline in domestic passenger
numbers in our fiscal year to March 1993,' Mr Yagi said.
In spite of a 0.3 per cent fall in domestic passengers to 33.3m, these
services remained profitable last year.
By contrast, the international operations facing fierce fares competition
lost money, although passenger numbers rose by 7 per cent to 1,574,201.
ANA expects competition on international services from Japan to intensify
during the next two to three years with the completion of new runways at
Tokyo and Osaka offering greater access for rival international airlines to
fly into the Japanese market.
'Our domestic services will continue to be in the future our core business,'
Mr Yagi said.

FT  26 APR 93 / International Company News: Deal soon on Leyland trucks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 40m-plus deal, including the management buy-out of Leyland Daf's
Lancashire truck factory, is expected to be finalised this week following
agreement over the week end by Barclays Development Capital to provide all
the equity finance.
An equity injection of Pounds 5m was the final piece needed to complete a
complicated package involving the company's management, clearing banks,
Barclays Development Capital and Lancashire Enterprises.
Coopers and Lybrand, the management's principal adviser, will today start
what it hopes will be final negotiations with Arthur Andersen, the Leyland
Daf receiver. The aim is to complete the deal before Friday.
If successful, the buy out would secure the 900 jobs remaining at the truck
factory in Leyland, Lancashire. Nearly 1,200 jobs have been lost there since
Daf's parent company in the Netherlands went into receivership in February.
If the factory was to close, it would leave a gap in Daf's range of trucks
in Europe.
Under the deal now proposed by Coopers, Lancashire Enterprises - the
privatised industrial development arm of Lancashire County Council - would
buy the 230-acre site and 1.8m sq ft complex of factory buildings from the
receiver. It would then lease back 800,000 sq ft of factory space to the
truck company's management - which is all the truckmaker says it will need -
and develop the rest as a science and technology park.
The values of individual elements of the deal have not been disclosed but Mr
Tony Hyams, director of the Manchester office of Barclays Development
Capital, put the total between Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m.
Management would buy the business and other assets - such as equipment,
stock and work-in-progress - needed to run it, but would be free of the
burden of having to buy land and buildings, the bulk of which it does not
need.
Most of the management's deal would be financed with bank loans. It has been
talking with Barclays and NatWest.
The package envisages deferred terms for the buyout, involving a large down
payment, of which the equity injection is an important element. Staged
payments would follow over several months, funded from cash flow. The
company has sufficient contracts with the British Ministry of Defence and
Daf dealers throughout Europe to guarantee future payments, provided it can
keep trading.
Lancashire Enterprises is confident about marketing the site, which is
strategically well-placed near the M6 motorway south of Preston. There is a
large pool of skilled local labour because of the concentration of delining
and defence industries in the area
Mrs Louise Ellman, leader of Lancashire county council and deputy chairman
of Lancashire Enterprises, said: 'This deal would maintain truck production
in the area and safeguard thousands of jobs among suppliers, many of whom
are locally-based.'

FT  26 APR 93 / International Company News: Pounds 150m tag on Field in
summer flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIELD GROUP, one of the longest established and biggest carton packaging
companies in Britain, will come back to the stock market through a flotation
in the summer which is expected to value it at about Pounds 150m.
Field was first listed on the stock exchange in 1929, but has had a series
of different owners since being purchased by Reed in 1965. In 1988 it was
sold as part of the management buy-out of its parent's packaging interests,
Reedpak, which was in turn acquired in 1990 by SCA, the Swedish paper and
packaging group.
The recession caused SCA to sell Field in 1991 through a Pounds 109m
management buy-out led by Mr Jim Gilchrist, the company's chief executive
since 1986.
In spite of these changes of ownership, Mr Gilchrist said the business had
continued to grow steadily and now had 14.5 per cent by value of the UK
market for folding cartons.
Field's cartons are used to package brands such as Kodak, Cadbury's Milk
Tray and Chivas Regal, and a significant proportion of its output is
exported. Sales for the year to April 4 are estimated to have grown from
Pounds 124m to not less than Pounds 135m.
The group employs about 1,900 people and has six manufacturing sites in the
UK and one in Belgium. Some 600 employees participated in the 1991 buy-out,
which was organised by CINVEN, the venture capital arm of the Coal Board
pension fund, and Barclays Bank among others.
Mr Gilchrist said: 'By focusing on market sectors with international
exposure such as confectionery, drinks, tobacco and pharmaceuticals, Field
has proved resilient to the recession, increasing sales by an average of 11
per cent per annum over the last five years.'
Field is to use the proceeds to help it expand steadily in higher-margin
areas such as pharmaceutical packaging.

FT  26 APR 93 / International Company News: Changing image at Pearson / A
look at its strategic move towards TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAY SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Thames Television executive said with a smile that Pearson had 'started
wearing its hair just a shade longer.'
He was referring to the planned acquisition of Thames by the publishing,
banking and industrial group noted more for caution and a rather
conservative outlook than getting involved in racy and high risk businesses
such as indepenDent television production.
Yet with irrevocable undertakings already given for Thorn EMI's 58.85 per
cent stake in Thames at 200p a share, Lord Blakenham, chairman and chief
executive of Pearson, will soon find himself in control of Rumpole of the
Bailey, the smutty double entendres of the Benny Hill Show and Arthur
Daley's Minder.
But why should Pearson want to buy Thames when its principal asset, its
broadcasting licence, has already been lost to Carlton Communications, and
why should Thames be seen as a 'nice little earner' worth just under Pounds
100m? Many of its remaining assets, programmes such as This is Your Life and
Wish You Were Here, have been around a long time and could be replaced by
ITV at any time after the end of this year.
Pearson's decision to buy what is now the UK's largest independent producer
is not a totally new departure. The publishing group already has stakes in
BritishSky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, and in Yorkshire
Tyne Tees Television.
However, last autumn the Pearson board took a strategic decision - that it
had to have a more central role in visual media to complement its profitable
but mature print based companies such as the Financial Times and Penguin
Books.
Although Pearson has no plans to dispose of its oil services and fine china
businesses - at least for the foreseeable future - the company is likely to
move towards being a more tightly focused media and entertainment group.
Against such a background Pearson and Thames were destined to meet.
Parts of the Thames deal are easy to value - others much less so. Apart from
a net cash balance of Pounds 13.8m there is the recently revalued Pounds 20m
stake in the Astra satellite system and freehold studios at Teddington.
The Thames programme library of more than 10,000 hours has been variously
valued at amounts ranging from Pounds 18m to Pounds 80m. Mr Derek Hunt, the
retiring finance director of Thames, insists the truth definitely lies
somewhere between those two figures.
The programmes already being shown are the UK Gold Library Channel launched
on satellite by Thames and the BBC. A second channel of general
entertainment aimed mainly at women is expected in the autumn.
Programme making is even more difficult to value. ITV will pay Thames more
than Pounds 40m this year for its programmes, many of them in the ITV top
20, but so far no longer term contracts have been signed. Rating winners
such as the three times a week police series The Bill are likely to have a
considerable life on ITV. Thames longer term success will depend on its
ability to come up with new ideas for sale to UK broadcasters and
international markets.
But even if a fraction of the hundreds of televison channels now being
promised actually materialise, then there will be a growing demand for
programmes from those who own the rights in them.
Thames represents the core of a ready-made television division for Pearson.
But Mr Frank Barlow, managing director of Pearson and current chairman of
BSkyB, clearly sees it as something of a beginning. Stakes in other
broadcasters around the world and the launch of new international channels
could follow.

FT  26 APR 93 / International Company News: Anagen valued at Pounds 40m in
June float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANAGEN, a biotechnology company with no sales to date, plans to raise about
Pounds 10m through a flotation in June. About 25 per cent of the company's
capital will be sold in the float through its brokers Albert E Sharp, giving
a total market valuation of some Pounds 40m.
Anagen is developing a line of automated medical diagnostic systems
following development of a fully automated immunoassay system.
The initial product, to be known as AN2000, is a fully automated immunoassay
system which is an ultrasensitive method of measuring the presence of cancer
markers, fertility hormones and other substances in blood.
Mr Mervyn Sennett, managing director, said the company will not be ready for
commercial production until November 1993 although its product is currently
in pre-production.
Its development costs - so far at Pounds 14.5m - are financed by a
consortium of venture capital firms led by Schroder Ventures and including
CINVEN, the venture capital arm of the Coal Board pension fund, Electra
Capital, Norwich Union Venture Capital and Questa.
Anagen has signed a marketing agreement with Organon Teknika, a subsidiary
of Dutch pharmaceutical chemicals company Akzo. Teknika already markets a
line of tests for such diseases as hepatitis and HIV, considered
complementary with the product line contemplated by Anagen.

FT  26 APR 93 / All Nippon Airways plans to cut dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL NIPPON Airways (ANA), Japan's largest airline, is planning to cut its
dividend in the face of the downturn in the international and Japanese
airline markets.
The airline expects to report sharply lower net profits of around Y3bn
(Pounds 17m) for the year ended March, 1993, against a profit of Y7.6bn
previously.
Profits are expected to remain under pressure during the next two years, Mr
Isao Yagi, ANA's corporate planning director, said.
Mr Taiji Kameyama, ANA's head of international relations, warned the
dividend was likely to be trimmed. 'It represented 10 per cent of the face
value of the shares last year; this percentage will most probably be reduced
this year,' he said.
The airline is embarking on rationalisation and cost-cutting, including
increased use of aircraft leasing, the reduction in the annual intake of new
recruits, the possible hiring for the first time of lower-cost foreign cabin
attendants, and the redeployment of corporate headquarters staff to sales
and marketing functions.
Faced with a Y10bn increase in interest charges, the airline is reining back
its 1991-95 capital spending programme from Y1,300bn to Y1,000bn, and is
delaying the introduction of some new aircraft.
The airline's international operations lost money last year while domestic
operations were profitable.

FT  26 APR 93 / Economics Notebook: A cool look at the costs of global
warming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE environment is a bit like Lewis Carroll's Cheshire cat where economic
policy-making is concerned.
Environmental arguments loom as large as life if they can be used to bolster
the case for unpopular measures. At other times, however, the environmental
cause fades even when it may be vitally important to the future physical and
economic welfare of the nation concerned.
Take two recent examples. In his March Budget, Britain's chancellor Mr
Norman Lamont cited last year's agreement in Rio de Janeiro on a new UN
convention on climate change as the reason for imposing value added tax on
domestic fuel and power from 1994 and for UK government plans to increase
road fuel duties by an average 3 per cent a year in real terms in future
Budgets.
Less than a month later, Mr Lamont was in Tokyo at the Group of Seven
finance and foreign ministers' meeting to decide western help for Russia.
Although Mr Lamont's Budget speech had referred to the possible need for
further co-ordinated international action on global warming, he and his G7
colleagues failed to consider any such plan when working out how best to
help Russia.
Admittedly, Russia's problems of slumping output, incipient hyperinflation
and policy gridlock were and are pressing. Moreover, the perceived need of
the West to provide speedy support for President Boris Yeltsin probably
precluded an elaborate link between western support for economic reform and
action to clean up Russia's environment.
But Mr Lamont's Budget speech referred to the Rio convention on climate
change as a 'milestone in international efforts to halt global warming'. If
it is that important, it clearly merited being taken into account in the
discussions over Russia's economic policy.
The reason why is spelt out in a recent work* from the Paris-based
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. This makes clear
that efforts to control global warming by limiting the emission of
greenhouse gasses cannot succeed if they are confined to the industrial
countries.
Russia and the other former communist countries of the Soviet Union and
eastern Europe have - alongside India and China - a key role to play in
limiting the output of carbon dioxide, the most important man-made
greenhouse gas, in the next 50 years.
Using an econometric model, known as GREEN, the OECD has concluded that its
24 industrialised member states would need to cut emissions by 44 per cent
compared with the level that could be expected on a 'business-as-usual'
basis if they were to act alone in the spirit of Rio to stabilise their CO
emissions at 1990 levels in the period to 2050. But this effort, which would
inevitably cost output, would reduce world emissions by only 11 per cent
from what they would otherwise be.
'Thus', the OECD says, 'action to tackle the climate change issue must
involve the major non-OECD countries emitters - China, India and the former
Soviet Union.'
At first sight, Russia is not the biggest problem. On a business-as-usual
basis, the OECD projects that China and India, with their much larger
populations and relatively unsophisticated technologies, will increase
carbon emissions by an annual average of 3.7 and 3.9 per cent respectively
in the period from 1990 to 2050. By contrast, the growth of carbon emissions
in the former Soviet Union is projected at 1.4 per cent a year on average.
In the OECD area, emissions would grow by 1 per cent a year if no action is
taken.
On the other hand, Russia and the other former Soviet republics top the
international league table for subsidising domestic energy prices.
The OECD study makes clear that only the western industrial countries
actually tax energy. Coal prices in China and India are kept lower than
marginal costs. At the time of writing, the administered oil prices in the
former Soviet Union were only a tenth of the world prices because recent
increases in the official oil price had been offset by successive rouble
devaluations. Russia's domestic oil prices have fluctuated wildly in
relation to the world price in recent months but are now estimated at only 4
per cent of world prices compared with about one third last autumn.
The OECD study estimates that worldwide energy subsidies (net of taxes in
the industrial countries) amount to Dollars 235bn (Pounds 152bn) in 1985
prices and exchange rates, which is equivalent to a subsidy of Dollars 45
per ton of carbon pumped into the atmosphere. Subsidies in the former Soviet
Union alone totalled Dollars 163bn, an implicit subsidy of Dollars 175 a ton
of carbon produced, it says.
Eliminating energy subsidies worldwide could go a long way to cutting carbon
dioxide emissions. Calculations based on the GREEN model suggest that such a
reform would cut world emissions by almost 20 per cent below
business-as-usual levels in 2050 while also raising the real income of many
non-OECD countries by improving the efficiency with which energy resources
are used.
US and UK officials argue that the International Monetary Fund's economic
reform programme for Russia should go some way to reducing such subsidies as
Russia brings its energy prices into line with world market levels.
But if - and it may be a big if - we are to take global warming seriously,
it is difficult not to conclude that the G7 missed a trick in its recent
negotiations in Tokyo.
Although it is always possible to dispute the assumptions behind, and
results from, econometric exercises such as GREEN, the OECD's figures
suggest that a huge effort will have to made in both the industrialised and
non-industrialised countries to limit emissions of greenhouse gases.
Making the environment a clear part of the G7 assistance for Russia would
have provided a useful precedent for the international co-operation
agreements that will be needed to turn the aspirations of last year's Rio
earth summit into reality.

FT  26 APR 93 / Bond traders take over the reins of Wall Street / A look at
a shift in power as takeover experts lose status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALL STREET'S bond traders are on a roll.
Not only have they been bringing in billions of dollars of revenues for
their employers in recent years, and millions of dollars in salary and
bonuses for themselves, but they have also taken a firmer grasp of the reins
of management on Wall Street.
Their rise is a turnround from the 1980s, when the investment bankers from
corporate advisory and mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) departments, who put
together the multi-million dollar transactions and earned the multi-million
dollar fees, ruled the roost. Revenues from the M&amp;A business have tumbled
over the past few years, and with them the status of corporate advisers and
dealmakers.
Recent managerial changes at big firms illustrate how the power base on Wall
Street has shifted.
In the most interesting move, Morgan Stanley surprised Wall Street in early
March by announcing that Mr John Mack was replacing Mr Robert Greenhill as
president of the firm. Mr Mack emerged from the bond trading side, having
run Morgan Stanley's fixed-income securities operations for six years. His
predecessor was a veteran investment banker, and one of the top M&amp;A advisers
of the 1980s.
Later the same month, a management shake-up was announced at Merrill Lynch.
After the firm had created two management committees and moved executives,
analysts labelled Mr David Komansky, the head of Merrill's bond operations,
as the winner in the reshuffle. He was given charge of both debt and equity
trading and sales, and was promoted to the new office of the chief
executive.
Finally, at the end of March the investment bank Lehman Brothers named Mr
Richard Fuld, a former bond trader, as sole president of the company. Mr
Fuld's appointment left his former co-president, the M&amp;A veteran Mr Tomilson
Hill, out in the cold. Mr Hill promptly resigned.
As Mr Michael Flanagan, an analyst at Lipper Analytical in New York, says:
'Just from the examples we've seen over the past few months, the emergence
of the bond trader as a manager on Wall Street is more than a coincidence.'
Mr Perrin Long, securities industry analyst at First Michigan, agrees. 'Bond
traders, and traders in general, are getting more power. We saw that, for
example, with the recent shifting around of the second- and third-tier
levels of management at Morgan Stanley. And to some extent it's the M&amp;A
people and the dealmakers who are losing out.'
Mr Long, however, says there is nothing unusual about this power shift on
Wall Street. 'If we go back to May Day (the abolition of fixed brokerage
commissions in 1975) and the 1970s, the big guns were from the research
department. They then went away, and in came the M&amp;A people during the
1980s, and they had their day in the sun. Now it's the bond people who are
having their day in the sun. They will be in the driver's seat for the next
couple of years, at least until interest rates come back up.'
Low US interest rates and the steepening of the yield curve (the widening in
the differential between yields on short- and long-term government
securities) have been key elements in the traders' success.
Low rates have reduced firms' total interest costs, which despite large debt
loads are now shrinking to 1987 levels. And the steep yield curve has
allowed traders to borrow cheaply at the short end and use the money to buy
longer-term assets that not only earn higher rates of interest, but which
also have been appreciating considerably in value because of the booming
bond market.
In this favourable climate, bond traders have thrived. According to Mr Long,
trading revenues at Wall Street firms reached Dollars 16.3bn (Pounds 10bn),
up from Dollars 9.9bn in 1988. Over the same period, however, revenues from
the M&amp;A business have tumbled.
In 1988, at the height of the M&amp;A boom, Wall Street's investment bankers
brought in Dollars 1.37bn of fees from M&amp;A transactions. By last year, fees
were just Dollars 217.3m. Trading revenues now account for a much bigger
percentage of total industry earnings. In 1988, earnings from trading
accounted for about 19 per cent of industry revenues, while investment
banking revenues (which include M&amp;A, underwriting and corporate advisory
fees) accounted for about 10 per cent of the total. By 1992, trading
contributed 26 per cent of revenues, while the share taken up by investment
banking had risen to only 12 per cent.
Now that they play a greater role in generating profits, it is no surprise
that traders are assuming more power on Wall Street. Yet does this mean that
firms will now concentrate their energies more on their trading businesses,
and less on the traditional work of advising corporate clients? Such a
strategic shift would make the industry's earnings, already very volatile,
even more prone to sudden swings.
An emphasis among Wall Street firms on trading for their own account,
however, is not a particularly new development. Since the mid-1980s
securities houses and investment banks have increasingly pursued the
shorter-term rewards of trading profits more rigorously than they have the
longer-term returns from client relationship banking. The arrival of the
traders at the top of the management tree can be seen as the culmination of
that process.
As for the danger of increased earnings volatility, Wall Street firms are
well aware of the potential pitfalls.
In the past few years many of the biggest players in the industry have added
a new dimension to their earnings profile by aggressively building up a
presence in asset management - an area traditionally dominated by the big
mutual funds and money managers.
The asset management business has grown quickly. In 1985 the fees Wall
Street firms earned from managing client accounts totalled Dollars 947m.
Last year, the business brought in more than Dollars 3bn.
So does this mean that executives from the asset management will eventually
take their turn at the top, perhaps after the traders? It is unlikely, says
Mr Long, who adds, only half joking, that asset management 'just isn't a
sexy enough business for Wall Street'.

FT  26 APR 93 / Soros puts Dollars 400m into rising gold market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GEORGE Soros, the international currency trader, has agreed to buy a
Dollars 400m (Pounds 259m) stake in Newmont Mining, the Denver-based gold
mining company, as a way of gaining exposure to the rising gold market.
The company will announce today that funds controlled by the Soros family
have bought 6.8m shares in Newmont and agreed to buy a further 3.2m shares
at a cost of Dollars 39.50 a share. About 9m of the shares are being sold by
General Oriental Investment, which is controlled by Sir James Goldsmith,
with the rest coming from Lord Rothschild's RIT Capital Partners.
The sale will make Mr Soros the second largest shareholder in Newmont Mining
with 13 per cent, leaving Sir James with a stake of about 30 per cent. Lord
Rothschild's stake will fall from 7 to 5 per cent. Mr Soros rose to fame in
September when he made a Dollars 1bn profit as the UK was forced to leave
the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System.
Mr Gordon Parker, Newmont's chairman and president, said yesterday that he
'couldn't have imagined a better home for the shares, for what it tells the
world about sentiment on gold'.
The gold market has been improving recently with the price reaching a
six-month high of Dollars 347 per troy ounce on Friday.
'We're seeing the confluence of gold as a commodity and gold as money,' said
Mr Parker. Demand for gold from Asia has been increasing while production
has remained steady. At the same time, investors have increasingly been
buying gold as a hedge against uncertainty in the currency markets, fear of
inflation and economic unrest.
Newmont's shares rose by Dollars 3 in New York trading on Friday to Dollars
45 7/8 while trading in gold futures on the Comex was extremely busy.
Mr Parker said that Sir James's decision to sell part of his Newmont stake
was consistent with his plans when he bought into the company two and a half
years ago. Sir James first started selling Newmont shares in February when
he placed 1.8m with a range of institutions. At the time, he said he was
still bullish on gold.
Sir James acquired a 42 per cent holding in Newmont as part of a deal with
Lord Hanson in October 1990.

FT  26 APR 93 / Daf vans plant to be sold to MBO team

<TEXT>
A MANAGEMENT buy-out team from Leyland Daf Vans reached agreement with the
administrative receivers at the weekend to take over the Birmingham-based
van operations of the failed Dutch commercial vehicle maker.
A separate management buy-out of Leyland Daf's truck factory in Lancashire
is also expected to be announced this week, securing the plant's remaining
900 jobs.
The van deal is supported by funding of around Pounds 45m, including equity
support from a venture capital consortium led by 3i, UK government financial
aid including regional selective assistance, and bank facilities provided
mainly by the Royal Bank of Scotland.
The total funding includes the purchase price, working capital, and
financing of dealer stocks. Equity in the venture is understood to total
around Pounds 7.5m in both ordinary and redeemable preference shares.
The deal marks the first rescue of part of the Leyland Daf truck and van
operations in the UK, which plunged into receivership at the beginning of
February as part of the financial collapse of Daf, the Dutch commercial
vehicle maker.
Mr Murdoch McKillop of accountants Arthur Andersen, one of the joint
receivers, said the rescue of the van operations had 'put a whole corner of
the (Leyland Daf) jigsaw firmly into place'.
The MBO has saved around 975 jobs at the Birmingham plant, with workers
agreeing to a pay cut as part of the rescue. Separate negotiations are under
way for the rescue of the other parts of the failed UK Leyland Daf business
including the Multipart parts warehouse and distribution operation at
Chorley, Lancashire, the Albion axle and components plant at Glasgow, the
marketing and sales operation at Thame, Oxfordshire, and the individual
international businesses in several African countries.
The rescue marks a more interventionist approach by the UK government. The
deal has received UK state funding both through regional selective
assistance totalling around Pounds 4m from the Department of Trade and
Industry, and through additional finance of Pounds 4m provided to the
Birmingham Heartlands Development Corporation to purchase 42 acres of
surplus land at the Leyland Daf van plant site at Washwood Heath in east
Birmingham.
The business plan prepared by the MBO team is far more modest than the
failed van strategy developed by Daf in the wake of its takeover of the
former Freight Rover van operations in 1987 as part of its acquisition of
Leyland Vehicles.
The MBO team plans to concentrate on the sale of basic, low-cost utility
panel vans to large UK fleet customers.

EAST European governments are frustrated by growing protectionism among
western states pledged to assist economic reform in the region, several east
European trade and economy ministers warned yesterday.
The ministers voiced their concerns during a weekend meeting in Tokyo of
ministers and businessmen from the Group of Seven leading industrialised
nations and their counterparts from east European and former Soviet states.
The conference discussed proposals to assist micro-economic reforms such as
privatisation, small business development and trade promotion in east
Europe. But growing signs of protectionism in west Europe sparked prolonged
and heated debate.
Several east European delegates warned that without access to export
earnings it would be harder for former communist states to reduce foreign
debts and so stabilise public finances.
Dr Karel Dyba, the Czech economy minister, told the meeting that to attract
foreign investment from the west, eastern states needed access to export
markets.
Mr Dyba said: 'If we are to help ourselves we have to have access to
markets. We are worried by some tendencies in some western countries towards
more protectionism.'
Mr Bela Kadar, Hungary's minister for international economic relations,
said: 'We want to speed up the implementation of a free trade agreement
within Europe. But the propensity of the west to speed up the removal of
trade obstacles seems to have diminished in recent months.'
Western officials conceded that trade tensions were a growing concern. Ms
Helle Degn, Danish minister for development representing the EC presidency,
said trade liberalisation could not proceed as quickly as the east wanted
because some west European industries were sensitive about low-cost
competition.
Mr Andrei Shapovaliants, the Russian deputy economic minister, said the
issue of protectionism had been the most vexed. 'We have to export to repay
our debts,' he said.

FT  26 APR 93 / EC backs new Serbian sanctions: Foreign ministers express
grave reservations about the use of force

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers yesterday backed tougher UN sanctions
aimed at ending the fighting in former Yugoslavia, but left open the option
of military intervention against the Bosnian Serbs.
After two days of talks at Hindsgavl Castle near the Danish town of
Middelfart, the ministers pledged to enforce new sanctions which will freeze
Serbian assets abroad and clamp down on traffic on the Danube and in the
Adriatic Sea from today.
The EC agreed to consider appointing a new 'sanctions supremo' to streamline
the multiple international efforts to tighten the sanctions, with the UK
favouring an American.
Lord Owen, the international mediator, in Belgrade yesterday tried to win
last-minute backing for his international peace plan from Bosnian Serb
leaders. At the end of his five-day diplomatic shuttle around the Balkans,
Lord Owen cautioned that the fate of the Serbian people hung on the
acceptance of the plan, which divides Bosnia into 10 provinces along ethnic
lines.
If Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, rejects the proposed maps,
more sanctions will go into force in Yugoslavia, now comprising Serbia and
Montenegro, at midnight New York time today.
Deputies to the Bosnian Serb assembly last night debated whether to accept
the peace plan. In the 11th-hour meeting, a shaken Mr Karadzic warned
deputies in the frontier town of Bjelina that the international community
would impose sanctions and was also likely to bombard Serb-held parts of
Bosnia.
An often stammering Mr Karadzic asked deputies if they were 'prepared to
wage war against the entire world' if they failed to back the plan.
Croats again fought Moslems, their former allies in several towns in central
Bosnia despite an organised ceasefire.
The EC ministers expressed grave reservations about using force against the
Bosnian Serbs because of unpredictable consequences and the risk of
disrupting the United Nations humanitarian effort. Mr Klaus Kinkel, German
foreign minister, said: 'We could pass the point of no return.'
The UK, however, appeared to cross a psychological line on Saturday when UK
officials said Britain was prepared to use force if necessary to protect 150
Canadian troops engaged in humanitarian operations in Srebrenica.
UK officials have said they expect a senior US envoy to arrive in Europe for
consultations on possible military options. But Mr Hurd said he did not
expect 'a cut and dried plan' and said UK support would depend on its
concerns about the use of force being met satisfactorily. France, along with
other EC members, stressed that the use of force required UN backing.

FT  26 APR 93 / Portillo expects modest recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is heading for an economic recovery which will be modest compared
with that of the 1980s but should be better sustained, Mr Michael Portillo,
chief secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday.
Provisional first-quarter figures for gross domestic product to be published
today are generally expected to signal a formal end to the recession.
Mr Portillo said it was likely that rates of growth 'even a few years out'
would not be as fast as in the 1980s, but that they would be 'better
sustained, for a longer period of time and with greater certainty'.
He said recent data on industrial production, retail sales, exports and from
the housing market were 'very encouraging' while, contrary to expectations,
there had been falls in unemployment.
The government was confident that it would meet its goal of holding
underlying inflation in the 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range this year
and next.
Mr Portillo, in an interview on BBC Radio's World this Weekend programme,
promised the government would adjust its policies to keep inflation under
control. Although 'there was no immediate prospect' of the UK rejoining the
European exchange rate mechanism, the government would take account of the
sterling exchange rate in pursuing its goal of low inflation.
Mr Portillo rejected suggestions that Britain's manufacturing industry had
been so weakened by the recession that the country faced another cycle of
stop-go.
'I don't know that this recovery is going to be like other recoveries,' he
said. He pointed out that UK manufacturing productivity and exports had
never been higher. Because industry had kept control of wages, unit wage
costs were falling, giving the British economy a lasting efficiency and
competitive gain that was 'over and above' that conferred by the fall in the
value of sterling since last September.
Falling unit wage costs might already have contributed to surprise falls in
unemployment in February and March. He urged managers, trade unions and
opposition parties to support further wage restraint.
Mr Portillo also sounded an optimistic note about UK export prospects in
spite of the worsening economic condition of Britain's main European
markets. The government has passed a turning point in its fortunes, Sir
Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, said yesterday. 'The fact of
the matter is that the recovery has been taking place over the last 12
months, but it has now speeded up,' he said on the BBC TV Breakfast with
Frost programme.

FT  26 APR 93 / Attali faces further criticism before EBRD annual meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development yesterday pressed ahead
with its efforts to help the economies of eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union as controversy about the bank's high spending continued to dog
Mr Jacques Attali, its president.
As the bank announced an Dollars 80m (Pounds 51.9m) loan to Romania to
improve its roads and launched a new programme on behalf of the United
Nations Development Programme to improve management practices in central and
eastern Europe, a senior German politician from Chancellor Kohl's Christian
Democrat party called for Mr Attali's removal from the top of the EBRD.
In a letter to Handelsblatt, the German business newspaper, Mr Karl Fell,
spokesman for the influential finance committee of the German Bundestag,
also urged Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister and current chairman
of the EBRD board of governors, to intervene more in the bank's affairs.
Referring to the high cost of fitting out the EBRD's London headquarters, Mr
Fell said that 'extravagance on such a scale would normally be regarded as a
breach of trust' in Germany. He also accused Mr Attali of being
'professionally out of his depth'.
The EBRD's annual meeting gets under way formally today in London with its
board of governors, representing the countries owning the bank, due to
discuss the costs of its City establishment as well as the bank's progress
towards assisting former communist countries develop market oriented
economies.
It is expected that member countries, if they want to voice criticism of Mr
Attali's management style, will save their most forthright comments for a
closed session of the board this afternoon rather than express them in the
public opening session.
However, Mr John Major, who as chancellor played a key role in ensuring the
EBRD would be headquartered in London, is expected to underline the
importance of the bank providing value for money when he speaks at today's
opening ceremony.
The British government appears to be satisfied with last week's statement
from Mr Attali in which he admitted that mistakes had been made at the bank.
It regards the measures that he announced to reinforce the EBRD's management
structure, including the plan to appoint a new budget director, as a good
basis for further development.
Some delegates attending the EBRD meeting also suggested that the bank might
emerge strengthened from the recent controversy, with its efforts more
clearly focused on assisting the former Communist countries and its member
countries taking a greater interest in its affairs.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US administration seems to be causing no little irritation in Tokyo with
its apparent attempt to talk up the yen. Having delivered a stimulus to the
Japanese economy which was larger than expected, the government had hoped
that US officials might ease off on trade. Instead, it seems that some of Mr
Clinton's advisers believe that the strengthening yen has prompted a drop in
Japanese car sales in the US. They hope that any further appreciation will
hit other Japanese exports. Either the Japanese make trade concessions or
the US allows a strong yen to do its work for it.
So far, Bank of Japan intervention has managed to hold the the line at Y110
to the dollar. Still, the pain is being felt. Japanese exporters are making
some efforts to reduce costs, but deep cuts have been avoided, and companies
are loath to give up cosy labour practices. While the currency has not moved
as sharply as it did in 1986, Japanese companies are starting with much
weaker balance sheets. Lower cost Asian manufacturing centres such as Taiwan
and even China are now producing high-quality textiles and commodity
electronics which are displacing Japanese goods. A strong currency is a
significant brake on the stock market's recent run.
It remains unclear whether a rising yen is the right prescription to solve
the trade problem. The imbalance is caused more by a collapse in Japanese
demand than by an export surge. Further cuts in the Japanese discount rate
might have more effect - always supposing that US exporters can take
advantage of any recovery in the domestic Japanese economy.

FT  26 APR 93 / The Lex Column: UK property
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
New life is struggling from the rubble that was the UK property sector. Last
week, British Land issued a Pounds 200m debenture stock following a Pounds
147m rights issue from Slough Estates. Great Portland Estates and Frogmore
Estates have also staged share placings to help fund acquisitions. The good
reception for these issues makes it likely that a wad of other paper will
follow. Companies may want to pay down debt to gain greater financial
flexibility.
But any enthusiastic shareholders will be taking a lot on trust despite the
sector's recent strong stock market rise. Intuitively, it may seem probable
that the bottom of the property cycle has been reached. Yet the latest
evidence suggests both rental and capital values are still falling fast. The
hope is that rights issues will lessen the compulsion for cash-strapped
property companies to sell high-yielding assets. For most, the cut in
gearing would not be enough to remove their attractions in the upturn. Fresh
capital may also create a self-reinforcing mechanism whereby greater
liquidity ensures firmer property values, more secure dividend yields and
higher share prices.
The theory is debatable. The most certain beneficiaries of fresh capital
injections into the property market, though, will be the banks. If the
appetite for new equity issues extends to some harder-pressed property
developers, this will help firm up some of the banks' shakier loans. New
funds may also stimulate the property market itself to the benefit of the
UK's two biggest property companies - Barclays and NatWest.

FT  26 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Tarmac
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Building material and construction companies have announced some thumping
provisions in recent weeks but Tarmac could lay claim to the clear-out cup
when it reports its results this week. The UK's biggest housebuilder
provisions may exceed Pounds 300m, knocking a quarter off the value of
shareholders' funds. Yet despite the profusion of red ink, both Tarmac and
its sector have been star stock market performers since sterling's
devaluation. Tarmac's shares have risen from a low of 53p in September to
140p now; the building materials sector is up by two-thirds.
Investor demand has been fuelled by falling interest rates, the continuing
strength of housebuilding starts and evidence that recent price rises from
the likes of Pilkington, Blue Circle and RMC appear to be sticking. Many
such companies have high financial and operational gearing ensuring that
even small sales and price increases have a startling impact on profits.
Savage cost-cutting has also left the sector primed for recovery.
Much of this, though, is already in the price. The prospective rating on
both the building materials and construction sectors now stands at a
considerable premium to the market. Many companies will doubtless exploit
such buoyancy and seek extra funds. Nevertheless, few investors will want to
sell such stocks at this point in the cycle. Guessing the intentions of the
predatory and cash-rich MB-Caradon will only add spice to the market.

FT  26 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Tough prescriptions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It will take more than comforting profits figures to restore drugs stocks to
a premium rating. With competition increasing and government regulation
tightening, past results are an unreliable guide to future prospects. Yet
respectable first-quarter figures from the likes of Merck and SmithKline
Beecham last week lifted the stricken sector. Friday's correction
notwithstanding, drug company ratings may have hit bottom just below the
market average.
A sustained rally cannot be expected until Mrs Clinton's plans for reform of
US healthcare are clearer. Even then, most drugs stocks will not return to
the heady rating of the 1980s. That was founded on worldwide sales of
pharmaceuticals which, according to Zeneca's pathfinder prospectus, grew at
an annual compound rate of 13 per cent. The price component of that growth -
perhaps 5 percentage points - is unlikely to be repeated. Regardless of US
reforms, buyers of healthcare are getting tough. Following government
intervention, drug prices are falling in Japan and Germany. Margins will be
squeezed even if volume growth is maintained.
The industry can cut costs, especially in sales and marketing. But that will
only run so far. Profit margins of 30 per cent, after research and
development expenditure, look unsustainable. If volume growth can match the
1980s, drug company prospects might still look better than the market
average - but only for those which develop innovative new drugs. The best in
the sector may return to a premium rating. Robbed of the ability to hide
behind price increases, the rest may never make a full recovery.
