FT  26 APR 93 / Leading Article: The bombing of the City
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDONERS picking their way back to work today through a litter of broken
glass should spare a moment's thought for the cities of Northern Ireland,
devastated over the past quarter-century on a scale that defies comparison
with Saturday's damage in the City.
If the Northern Ireland policy supported by all Britain's political parties
is correct, it would be quite wrong to waver in it now merely because the
buildings being damaged are in Bishopsgate not Belfast.
In discovering the vulnerability of London's financial district to large,
primitive bombs, the IRA has put its hands on a fresh, powerful weapon. That
does not of itself change the nature of the political problem - it merely
adds to its urgency.
These are the issues of principle. But many people, in the City and
elsewhere, will find one practical issue more pressing. How great a threat
do two huge explosions in a year pose to London's position as a financial
centre?
The initial responses of some of the companies most affected by the two
giant bomb attacks are reported elsewhere in this issue. On this sort of
occasion, however, second thoughts are the ones that count. They will be
influenced by a number of factors. First will be the adequacy of the
insurance arrangements, underpinned by government guarantee, which were set
in place after last year's explosion.
The scheme is in its infancy; its enabling legislation has yet to pass
through parliament. The government would be right to avoid legalism in its
approach to this issue. The important thing is to make sure that the scheme
works, and that the state provides the backing necessary for it to do so.
Escape route
A second factor is the way in which changing modern business practices
reduce the impact of this sort of disaster. These days, a large business has
its files, its intellectual capital, its soul, stored in its computers.
That sounds like an added risk, but in fact it is an escape-route. Providing
the computer operators have been taking routine security measures - backing
up the files daily, storing copies safely off-site, and so on - the entire
system can be rapidly re-created elsewhere.
The third factor is less encouraging. The risk is that the bombing will be
one more reason to view London as different, risky, a place at the margin,
subject to its own unpredictable influences.
There are enough of such forces already at work: the EMS debacle, the Taurus
collapse, the City's well-known transport problems, the local authority
swaps fiasco - even the perennial nuisance of passing through immigration
controls at Heathrow.
City's advantages
Until now, these have been far outweighed by London's countervailing
advantages: an open, innovative atmosphere, skilled labour and support
services, welcoming authorities, and a cosmopolitan financial tradition. Two
bombs are unlikely to tilt the balance. But it is the future risks that
matter; and even with extra security precautions, they will clearly be much
greater than they seemed 13 months ago.
Britain's big financial houses are tied to London; so are the handful of
leading international ones. It is the smaller, more footloose institutions -
the ones that give the London markets their unique breadth and depth - which
can choose to vote with their feet. Ensuring that their decisions come down
in London's favour will require tighter security precautions, keener
intelligence and better use of police resources. But as important will be a
renewed determination to focus on the other aspects of the City's
competitiveness.
The speed with which the City has coped with the two big disasters of the
past year is a tribute to the professionalism of its support staff and the
flexibility and commitment of its workforce. Those are among the reasons why
London has remained the leading international financial centre. Its chances
of retaining that title were high before Saturday's bomb. They remain high
now - as long as the government, the City authorities and the leading
financial houses display a commitment not just to London's physical
security, but also to its future competitive advantage.

FT  26 APR 93 / Leading Article: Mr Heseltine's magic lantern
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine is enjoying himself again. After hard labour in the
House of Commons over the future of British Coal, the trade and industry
secretary is again doing what he does best - reorganising a Whitehall
department and selling a line in policy.
The central themes of the slide show he premiered to the Financial Times and
a group of industry leaders last week are incontestable. British industry is
inadequately competitive and the rambling government department which
oversees it is unfocused and ineffective.
Mr Heseltine has a good track record in Whitehall management. At both the
Department of Environment and the Ministry of Defence, he improved
motivation and efficiency. At the Department of Trade and Industry, he will
use similar techniques, overhauling structures and accountancy procedures
and drawing in private-sector managers to sharpen up performance.
'Partnership' has long been a Heseltine watchword and it is still very much
in vogue.
A key aim is to improve communication within the department and between
officials and industry, so that the DTI knows what it is talking about.
There will once more be teams of officials to analyse the competitiveness of
15 sectors of British industry; data base will speak unto data base in
government research establishments; a 'domesday book' of regulations will be
heavily edited; there will be 'one-stop shops' around the country to
facilitate the transmission of advice and information to business. Mr
Heseltine will proclaim these plans with a promoter's flair. Hezza is
backing British industry, in export markets and in the cabinet.
Good deeds
It will be some time before the effectiveness of these changes can be
judged, but they will certainly be welcome to British industrialists. The
question is whether Mr Heseltine, in his 1990s manifestation, will stop
short of the market-distorting and economically damaging forms of dirigisme
with which he flirted in the 1980s.
To judge by deeds rather than words, his record in the last year has been
good. He has fought for the right policy on coal, at some personal political
risk. He has resisted the temptation for quick, taxpayer-funded fixes at
Leyland Daf.
More doubtfully, his strengthened financial support for exporters could
result in subsidies for poor business deals, even if the measures are not
lavish by international standards. Government selection of 'national
champions', even in the limited context of bids for export contracts, is a
tricky game.
Competition policy
But the biggest question marks over Mr Heseltine's tenure at the DTI concern
competition policy and Europe.
On the former, he insists that there is no change in the Tebbit-Lilley
doctrine, to confine competition policy judgments to questions of
competition. But doubts have been raised in practice by his decision to
overrule the Office of Fair Trading in a couple of recent cases. Since Mr
Heseltine shares the view of his predecessors that no public explanation
should be given for these decisions, there is a danger that policy will
become opaque and arbitrary. With crucial judgments ahead on British Gas and
other privatised utilities, this is worrying.
More important still, if Mr Heseltine fosters an illiberal culture of shady
ministerial meddling in his own department, it will be reflected damagingly
in the councils of the European Community, where DTI ministers play a large
role, on everything from energy to trade.
Mr Heseltine's instincts will certainly be to join the political fray on
questions such as the future of Airbus and its potential collaboration with
Boeing on a super-jumbo project. He looks back with pride at his role in
creating the European Space Agency.
On some such matters, ministers have a necessary role, but there is a risk
that Britain is lured towards the unrewarding and outdated game of picking
industrial and technological Euro-winners. More broadly, Britain could blunt
its influence as an economic liberaliser, in matters of trade, industry and
energy. If he can avoid these pitfalls, Mr Heseltine will show that he is
the right man in the right job at the right time.

FT  26 APR 93 / Miracles beyond the free market: Whether east Asia's
economic success can be repeated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The biggest challenge for economists today is understanding the
extraordinary success of east Asia. The region has nearly quadrupled per
capita incomes in the past quarter of a century - a record unparalleled in
economic history. On present trends it may begin to overtake much of the
industrialised west early in the 21st century.
If its startling success could be replicated elsewhere, billions of people
in developing and formerly communist countries could look forward to
improved living standards. And the hope, eventually, of eliminating the
scourge of grinding poverty would seem less quixotic.
Yet the region is as puzzling as three-dimensional chess. It has done far
better than conventional theories predict, even allowing for such
quantifiable pluses as macroeconomic stability, high rates of investment and
a focus on exports. There is just no generally accepted explanation for its
main distinguishing feature - supercharged rates of productivity growth (see
chart).
The puzzle is deepened by the region's lack of homogeneity. The high-fliers
are far from being carbon copies. At one extreme, Hong Kong has pursued a
broadly free market approach; at the other, South Korea has intervened in
just about every way conceivable. And the magic formula for growth has
entirely eluded some countries in the region, such as the Philippines.
At the World Bank in Washington, an exhaustive analysis of the 'Asia
miracle' is nearing completion. Bank staff are distilling lessons from
Japan, the four 'tigers' - South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore -
and the so-called 'cubs' - Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. They have also
taken a look at the recent explosive growth in parts of southern China.
The study was undertaken partly at the instigation of Japan, the bank's
second-largest shareholder, which has long wanted to play a bigger role in
policy design. Japan has been critical of aspects of conventional World
Bank/International Monetary Fund prescriptions and, justifiably, believes
more attention should be paid to its own outstandingly successful
development strategies - which formed a model for much of east Asia.
In 1991, Japan's Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund told the bank it was
putting too much emphasis on deregulation and privatisation and made a case
for selective import protection in developing countries and for the use of
subsidised credits as a tool in industrial policy.
Mr John Page, a senior member of the bank's Asia miracle team, says the
Japanese criticism struck a chord because the results of market-oriented
reforms had often proved disappointing in developing economies. By cutting
budget deficits, eliminating market distortions and shrinking government,
client countries had stabilised their economies. But too often they had not
achieved a virtuous cycle of rapid growth; they still lay 'at the bottom of
the league table relative to east Asia'. The question became: 'What now?'
The bank's benchmark for judging Asian policies is not an extreme free
market philosophy, which would have the public sector shun responsibility
for just about everything bar national defence. It is rather the less
controversial 'market friendly' strategy set out at length in the bank's
1991 World Development Report.
This clearly delineates the role of markets and the state. Development would
be fastest, it claimed, when government concentrated on two jobs:
maintaining macroeconomic stability through conservative fiscal and monetary
policies; and investing in people through public education, training and
healthcare programmes.
Beyond this, developing countries should rely on market forces. They should
create as competitive as possible a regime in industry, commerce and the
financial sector. And they should eliminate all barriers to trade and
foreign investment. The core idea is that governments should focus on the
things only they can do and leave everything else to markets.
It turns out that most of the Asian high-fliers have adopted a more
permissive attitude to the role of government. Indeed, Mr Page argues that
the success of the region can best be understood in terms of a 'strategic
growth' model that focuses more on what has to be done to achieve rapid
growth than on who should do what.
On the strategic theory, development will be rapid provided countries find a
way of: accumulating capital rapidly; allocating resources efficiently; and
catching up technologically.
But there is no presumption that any of these functions should be reserved
exclusively for the private sector. The miracle economies appear to have
used a mixture of market incentives and state intervention in each of these
areas:
Accumulation. Gross domestic investment averages a startling 37 per cent of
GDP in east Asia against an average of 26 per cent in developing countries
as a whole. Yet this advantage was not won purely by adhering to the
market-friendly approach.
The region has admittedly created a positive climate for business investment
by pursuing conservative fiscal and monetary policies - inflation has
averaged 9 per cent over the past 30 years, less than half the rate in other
developing countries. The public sector has also invested effectively in
people (enrolment in primary education far exceeds levels elsewhere, as does
attention to vocational education), although it has not spent an atypical
proportion of national income on social services.
But most of the Asian high-fliers have also interfered with market
mechanisms. They have limited the personal sector's ability to consume and
heavily regulated the financial sector so as to ensure a predictable supply
of low-cost capital for industry. Mechanisms for forcibly shifting resources
from consumption to investment vary - Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, for
example, have maintained stringent controls on consumption and housing. The
net effect, however, is the same everywhere: an abnormally high rate of
savings.
Efficient allocation of resources. Governments have striven to ensure that
the most important market of all - that for labour - is flexible, if not
fully competitive. Wages have largely reflected market supply and demand,
partly because trade unions have been suppressed. Focusing hard on success
in export markets has also imposed crucial competitive discipline and
prevented domestic prices for industrial inputs moving far out of line with
world markets.
Yet bank research indicates governments have also intervened vigorously.
While less protectionist than the third world as a whole, few accepted
western free-trade principles. Many have used import controls to protect
strategic sectors (for example, quotas in South Korea, high tariffs in
Thailand) and showered offsetting subsidies on export industries. At one
time or another state-owned industries have played an important role in many
of the economies, including South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, Singapore and
Thailand. Many have not hesitated to direct the supply of credit to
particular sectors. Both South Korea and Taiwan provided automatic credit
for exporters in the early stages of development.
Technological catch-up. The lesson again is that remarkable productivity
growth only partly reflects market-oriented policies. Singapore, Malaysia,
Thailand and, to some degree, Taiwan, have welcomed foreign investment.
Early developers such as Japan and South Korea used other devices, such as
licences letting them copy foreign technology. But unlike many other
developing countries none tried to rely on home-grown technology.
However, all high-fliers intervened selectively to promote particular
industries, with varying intensity and success. The process of trying to
shift industrial output towards high-valued-added sectors is described by
enthusiasts as 'getting prices wrong in order to create dynamic comparative
advantage'.
South Korea provides a wealth of examples of aggressive and successful
intervention. The government's most audacious move was perhaps to create
from scratch a domestic steel industry despite foreign donor opposition and
lack of private-sector enthusiasm. The state-run business went on to become
the world's most efficient steel producer.
An internal bank memo sums up South Korea's record: 'From the early 1960s,
the government carefully planned and orchestrated the country's development.
. . . (It) used the financial sector to steer credits to preferred sectors
and promoted individual firms to achieve national objectives. . . . (It)
socialised risk, created large conglomerates (chaebols), created state
enterprises when necessary, and moulded a public-private partnership that
rivalled Japan's'
Singapore provides another classic example of directed growth. When private
sector companies failed to respond to opportunities identified by
bureaucrats, state-owned or controlled groups were often pushed to the fore,
the memo says. The bank has documented selective interventions throughout
the region, even in supposedly free market Hong Kong.
The Asian example poses a dilemma for bodies such as the IMF and the World
Bank, especially in former communist countries. Does it still make sense to
advocate a form of 'shock therapy' - the doctrine that deregulating and
privatising everything as fast as possible is the optimum policy? Or should
they recommend east Asia's slower, more interventionist path to economic
maturity? It all depends on whether east Asia's deviations from orthodoxy
can be replicated.
There are some grounds for caution. Mr Vinod Thomas, the bank's chief
economist for east Asia and an architect of the market-friendly strategy,
points out that government activism outside east Asia has produced dismal
results. A distinction should also be drawn between the earlier 'northern
tier' of Asian high-fliers - Japan, South Korea and Taiwan - and the later
'southern tier' of Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.
Until the 1980s, countries such as South Korea were able to promote exports
and protect imports without provoking much criticism. But pressure for a
more level playing field has since grown intense. Broadly speaking, the
southern tier of later developers has pursued more market-oriented policies
than the first wave of Asian stars. Industrial interventions have also
tended to be less successful. A bank memo describes Malaysia's efforts as
'by and large a costly failure' and Thailand's as 'largely ineffective'.
Less tangible political and cultural factors may also be crucial. Most Asian
high-fliers benefited from long periods of stable (if authoritarian)
political rule. This encouraged long-term horizons. Public-sector
bureaucracies have also tended to be more able and less corrupt than in most
other third world countries. Governments were thus unusually well placed to
implement development strategies.
Policymakers were also remarkably pragmatic; if a policy did not work it was
rapidly dropped. South Korea, for example, went through several phases. It
was relatively market-oriented in the early 1960s, became highly
interventionist during the 'heavy and chemical industries' drive of the
1970s, and then reverted to greater reliance on market forces in the
mid-1980s. No region, it seems, has been less weighed down by ideology or
more willing to seek advice from abroad.
The bank has only just begun the politically charged process of drawing
conclusions from mountains of research papers. But senior officials believe
the study may lead to a new paradigm for development in the 1990s. The
evidence confirms that the miracle economies did indeed 'do things
differently'. In many instances, 'government played a big role, trade was
not open and financial markets were repressed', concedes Mr Thomas.
'If we're right,' says Mr Page, 'the economic policy arsenal has many more
weapons than we suspected.' Mr Thomas agrees: the lesson from east Asia is
that 'you need a government guiding hand; you cannot just abdicate
development to the private sector'. He predicts that the bank will pay more
attention to the role of institutions and to the potential for partnerships
between the public and private sectors.
The most encouraging aspect of the Asian story, officials say, is that
habits and institutions crucial for economic success were created rather
than inherited. To raise the social standing of entrepreneurs, for example,
South Korea had to overcome its Confucian traditions, which had glorified
the scholar-bureaucrat. Singapore raised its savings rate from 1 per cent in
1965 to more than 40 per cent today. The implication is that sufficiently
determined governments can work similar miracles in other places.

Considering that it exists to promote independent non-executive
directorships - and is chaired by Sir Adrian Cadbury of corporate
governance, no less - Pro-Ned is scarcely a model of openness when it comes
to circulating its own annual report and accounts.
Perish the thought, but could one of the reasons be that, just as directors'
pay rises are coming in for such sharp criticism, the 1992 figures show the
organisation's highest paid director received a healthy 9 per cent increase
to a comfortable Pounds 77,812?
Since it would appear from the accounts that Pro-Ned is lacking a
remuneration committee at the moment, perhaps its board should consider
creating one to investigate such questions.

FT  26 APR 93 / Observer: Black biting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sixteen months after winning control of Australia's Fairfax newspaper group,
Conrad Black is embroiled in a second public row with John Kerin, the
country's former finance minister.
After Kerin claimed the bid was against the national interest, Black
labelled Australian politicians 'venal' and described the bidding process as
a 'degrading, grotesque charade', but was later allowed to acquire 15 per
cent of Fairfax, and management control.
Now Black is saying he became angry because, during a meeting with then
prime minister Bob Hawke, Kerin had assured him that foreign holdings of
less than 35 per cent were 'piffle', implying that the bid would be allowed
to go through.
In reply, Kerin claims that no assurances were given, and insists he would
never use such an un-Australian word as piffle.
All good fun, but the back-biting may be a bit academic. Black admits that
the government's 25 per cent ceiling on his Fairfax stake makes the group a
sitting duck if Kerry Packer decides to add to his 10 per cent holding.

Meanwhile any supposition of a deep change in Lady Thatcher's philosophy is
an exaggeration. However outraged she may be by the plight of Bosnia's
Moslems, she was back in classic form during her visit to Warsaw, whose
citizens must be feeling peculiarly blessed by the presence of retired
British politicians of conservative hue.
In town to open her foundation's office as well as Forte's new hotel, the
former prime minister drummed home to her audiences that they must never,
never succumb to the allure of Marxist and Leninist ideology. All would be
well in the world, she boomed, as long as the frontiers of socialism were
being turned back.
What may lead the local citizenry to feel not just blessed but somewhat
confused is that in Thatcher's wake there arrived her ex-deputy Lord Howe of
Aberavon, whose views on the matter differed in more ways than being voiced
in less strident tones.
Besides wondering aloud whether the situation in the erstwhile Soviet Union
would not take a turn for the worse, he admitted the west was now less
confident about the future than it had been three years ago when the Berlin
wall came down.
There was another contrast too.
President Lech Walesa, for reasons best known to himself, gave Lady Thatcher
a wide berth. But Lord Howe - attending the opening of a Centre for English
Legal Studies at Warsaw University, financed by the UK Know How Fund - did
get to renew acquaintanceships with Solidarity chiefs he met when he was
foreign minister and they were opposition leaders on a visit to Warsaw eight
years ago.

Could peace be near in the Beer War at Britain's Department of Trade and
Industry?
As Observer reported last Tuesday, Edward Leigh and Neil Hamilton, both of
them Thatcherite ministers at the department, are at loggerheads over
regulations that a pint must consist fully of liquid - the frothy head
cannot be included.
Hamilton wants to get rid of the rule as part of the government's
deregulation initiative. Leigh is sympathetic, but as he introduced the
regulation in the first place, he wants it saved.
A compromise plan being floated is that pubs should become total
regulation-free zones, able to serve beer in whatever measures they liked.
There would be no need to check that a pint was a pint, and disgruntled
customers could take their custom elsewhere.
Such radicalism has obvious appeal to right-wingers such as Hamilton and
Leigh. But it seems unlikely to win approval higher up in the government.
Indeed, the plan has the look of being brewed up over a pint or two.

The time for eating their own words has perhaps arrived for any pillars of

On Friday night leaders of the new worshipful company of same were looking

Telecentres.
But now the company's master, Mrs Steve Shirley, is volunteering to prove
the product's mobility by rescheduling the launch for London. The
demonstration model could easily be put on a lorry and delivered to the City
ready to operate from Wednesday morning, she says.

(Letters, April 15) for a much-increased emphasis on technology in
industrial and economic planning, I 'could make a stronger case'. But I
already have.
In my 1986 book Sunrise Europe (now regrettably out of print), I believe I
gave a convincing description of how the European electronics industry got
into its mess (now even messier) vis-a-vis the Americans and Japanese. And
this was followed by an even more convincing prescription of how to get out
of it through the increased demand for information technology products and
services which would have been created by my proposed pan-European
fibre-optic network, Eurogrid.
But, as usual, the cry of the technologists was of little avail. Apart from
the laboured efforts of the European Commission in setting up the Race
(Research on Advanced Communications in Europe) project, there is little
sign of my mooted broadband connections to every European home, office,
hospital and school etc. Meanwhile, President Clinton is energetically doing
just that by actively supporting the US infrastructure investment in
'information highways' - or the 'USA-grid'.
The point, then, is that whereas the views of technologists are important in
the formulation of corporate and governmental policies in America, Japan and
elsewhere in Asia, this is certainly not the case in the UK or many other
European countries. Until we can match their understanding of the salience
of technical matters, both in production and use of technological goodies,
we shall continue to suffer substantially lower economic growth rates than
our transoceanic competitors.

FT  26 APR 93 / Letter: Bar on age discrimination unlikely in EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRYAN CASSIDY MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Joe Rogaly's suggestion that we should be thinking of raising rather
than lowering the pension age ('Age of the old buffer', April 20) has an
attractive logic given the recent Carnegie inquiry projections of 31 per
cent of the UK population in the age group 50-74 by 2021, compared with 24
per cent now. But what are we going to do to enable older people to work
more years if they wish to? (Mr Rogaly quotes statistics which show a
declining percentage of men aged over 55 as being 'economically active'.)
One way would be for the EC to follow the US and bar age discrimination in
employment. I regret that it is unlikely to do so, however, since the
Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European parliament all
practice age discrimination in recruitment with the full approbation of EC
staff unions]

FT  26 APR 93 / Letter: No remuneration hike at Premier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr C JAMIESON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lucy Kellaway's article, 'Facts show fat cats are fatter' (April 20)
and the letter from Mr Donald Butcher, of the UK Shareholders' Association
(April 23), both suffer from a failure to check facts, and from the tendancy
for an untruth, once written, to be accepted as fact.
The supposed 50 per cent hike in management remuneration in Premier's 1992
accounts stems from an elementary failure to notice that the comparative
period is one of only nine months. When the comparative figure is grossed up
to the 12-month period, the increase is 12 per cent. However, this is not
due to directors being awarded 12 per cent increases, but that an additional
executive director joined Premier in June 1992 and in the previous year
another new executive director did not join until September 1991.
The real increase for executive directors for that year and for 1993 was
basically in line with inflation - that is, no increase. In 1993, following
retirement of two senior executive directors in June and December, total
management remuneration is likely to be down by at least 30 per cent.
I suggest that in future both your newspaper and the representative from UK
Shareholders' Association have the courtesy to check the facts. The old
adage about not being able to believe what you read in the newspapers seems
true in this situation, but unfortunately in our case mud tends to stick.

FT  26 APR 93 / Letter: Future of the Travelcard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MAXWELL BLAKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Why is it that the deregulation of London buses should be paid for by
their riders ('Travelcard doomed', April 22)? I use my Travelcard to go by
bus where I cannot easily travel by the Underground. Is the Travelcard
underpriced? Its 'critics' appear to forget that London Transport gets my
annual fare upfront; would that all customers were so willing.
Can it really be beyond the wit of 40 or so bus operators (about one bus
load, incidentally) to draw up a revenue-sharing agreement? It would be more
equitable to use the smart-card technology to record individual journeys at
the point of sale - that is, the bus - and use that data to apportion the
pooled revenue. That at least might encourage some competition between the
operators.

FT  26 APR 93 / Monopoly under the microscope / Examining the case for a
radical restructuring of British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the City of London headquarters of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission,
a handful of experts is hard at work disentangling one of the most
complicated issues in UK competition policy - what to do about British Gas.
The deliberations are being followed closely - not only by the monopoly gas
supplier, but by potential rivals in the industry and the rest of Britain's
privatised utilities. The MMC report is expected to set a marker for the
development of competition in industries privatised during the 1980s and
will determine in which areas, and to what extent, the gas market is opened
to new entrants.
The commission's discussions will focus on an ambitious blueprint for a
fully competitive gas market. The plan, drawn up by Sir James McKinnon,
director-general of the regulatory body Ofgas, calls for the division of the
company into 12 regional businesses, a separate gas-purchasing arm and a
pipelines company. So complex are the issues that the commission has
postponed its report, due at the end of this month, until the end of July.
Sir James's ideas are radical. His plan is to break up the monopoly
structure forced on the industry six years ago when British Gas was
privatised as a single entity. The company's dominant position in the market
has obstructed the development of competition, Sir James believes. Rivals
now supply about 30 per cent of industrial sales, but Sir James would like
to see competition extended beyond the industrial sector.
Ofgas also wants competitors to move into the household supply market -
where British Gas holds a monopoly. This is the only way to offer consumers
real choice and lower prices, Sir James claims.
Ranged against him are British Gas, many of the North Sea oil operators and
the Gas Consumers Council, which represents household customers. British Gas
says prices will rise in a more open market. Large industrial users fear
they will lose their access to cheap supplies of gas - which are currently
subsidised by household customers - if more competition is introduced.
British Gas desperately wants to retain its monopoly over household supply.
It has proposed decentralising its own operations in an effort to fend off
calls for a wholesale break-up. It has suggested to the commission that it
split its business into five wholly owned subsidiaries covering sales of gas
to the industrial market, household supply, pipelines, sales of appliances,
and installation and servicing. The company has also offered to disband its
central purchasing arm as a way of diminishing its buying power in the North
Sea.
British Gas receives some support from North Sea oil companies. Producers
such as Shell point to the need for long-term supply contracts to assist the
development of gas fields - these may not be available without British Gas's
strong buying power.
Shell argues that the current industry structure has served customers well
in many respects. Consumer groups agree with this prognosis. The Gas
Consumers' Council is sceptical about the benefits accruing to domestic
consumers in a liberalised market.
The commission's first challenge is to weigh these arguments and decide
whether British Gas's monopolistic power has worked against consumers'
interests. If it concludes that the household supply market should be opened
up to rivals, it must then decide how this could be done and, if necessary,
suggest relevant structural changes. But the commission can only recommend
action - the government does not have to follow its advice.
The government has indicated that it would look favourably on a gradual
opening of the gas market. Last year, Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said he
would consider the introduction of competition in household supply in May
this year. But the government's plans were thrown into disarray by the
monopolies reference last August.
Rival gas shippers are nonetheless convinced that pressures for liberalising
the market will be difficult to resist. British Gas has about 25 main
competitors in the industrial market and almost all of them have told the
commission they are keen to become involved in sales to households.
Though they differ over how quickly and in what way they should be given
access to those customers, the competitors to British Gas do agree that they
could offer customers cost savings. Alliance Gas, a joint venture between
British Petroleum and Norway's Statoil and Norsk Hydro, reckons that
households could save an average Pounds 50 a year or 10 per cent of their
gas bills if it were allowed to supply them. The company is basing its
claims on evidence drawn from sales to the industrial sector, where it
currently supplies 6,000 sites.
British Gas buys its gas at about 20p a therm and sells it to households at
close to 50p a therm, a substantial profit margin which competitors believe
they could erode. But the mark-up is not pure profit, counters British Gas.
Transportation costs must be added to the cost of the gas, and these are
higher for some customers than others. For this reason, the company says 12m
of its 18m customers could end up paying more in a liberalised market and
only 6m would make a saving.
British Gas believes there would be a political outcry if customers in those
parts of the country which are the greatest distance from the gas terminals
end up paying substantially higher costs than others.
In addition, the company has argued that the flow of gas through its
pipelines would be difficult to balance - ensuring that customers get enough
gas on cold days - with no single company to monitor supply and demand.
This view is echoed by some industry experts. 'If anything goes wrong in the
system, there will be all sorts of recriminations, with shippers blaming the
pipeline company and vice versa. In the meantime, the consumer is going
without gas,' said Mr Jonathan Stern, an industry consultant with the Gas
Strategies group.
Competitors say these drawbacks are not insurmountable, saying they could
provide financial bonds with the regulator so that the pipeline company
could draw on the money if rivals fail to meet their supply obligations. 'No
one worries about the security of supply of, say, milk,' said one rival.
The Gas Consumers' Council, however, says it is not convinced that
competition would bring more benefits to consumers than are currently
available from the heavily regulated monopoly. Mr James Cooper, chairman of
the council, is also doubtful about whether effective competition is
possible in the household market. He believes it is not practical to have
several companies competing for customers in a small area because of the
huge infrastructure required to service those customers.
Large industrial users are similarly sceptical about the benefits of
increased competition. They fear losing supplies of cheap gas in the
so-called interruptible market. Interruptible users pay very low prices for
their gas in return for being cut off during periods of peak demand  - on
the coldest days in winter - when their supply is redirected to households.
'We're getting ready to fight very, very hard to preserve the interruptible
market,' said Mr Anthony Mitchell-Harris, who represents large gas users in
the Major Energy Users Council, a lobby group.
If competitors were to supply the interruptible customers - and so far none
do because prices are too low - those large users fear prices would rise.
The rival suppliers would not have British Gas's economies of scale or the
same need to balance demand in the domestic market. In addition, if
competitors were promising savings to domestic customers, they would not be
able to subsidise industrial users.
British Gas is trying to allay such fears by suggesting the creation of a
market in peak gas sales to cover supply in this sector of the market.
Initially, it says, competing suppliers could bid for industrial contracts,
with the sale going to the lowest bidder. Eventually, a so-called spot
market could evolve, where gas is bought and sold like any other commodity.
The company is planning to consult its rivals on how this market might work.
British Gas will be hoping that such proposals will pre-empt the imposition
of more radical reform. It might draw some comfort from the government's
concern to avoid another damaging energy dispute after its controversial
coal decisions. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, will
be aware that he is bound to make enemies whichever way he decides. He is
likely to hope that the experts remain embroiled in the complexities of the
sector for as long as possible.

FT  26 APR 93 / Personal View: Germany in need of new policy mix
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUERGEN B DONGES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Western Germany is in recession. Real gross domestic product is now expected
to fall in 1993 by between 1.5 and 2 percentage points; unemployment will
rise; and a turning point may be reached only in the first half of 1994,
provided expectations of a sustained economic recovery in the US and a rapid
expansion of world trade materialise. The western German economy, to be
sure, will not play the role of a locomotive for the rest of European
Community in the near future. The hope is that the recession does not become
stronger than is now foreseen, otherwise eastern Germany would be adversely
affected.
To many, it appears that a quick recovery is impeded by the Bundesbank's
high interest rates which have strangled the other EC economies and thus
have hampered German exports. But the Bundesbank is not the problem; the
real difficulties lie elsewhere.
The biggest problem is fiscal policy. The fiscal deficit has been rising
significantly since unification. In 1992, it amounted to 4 per cent of GDP;
if off-budget liabilities are included, the deficit was 7 per cent. Public
financial transfers to eastern Germany (about DM150bn (Pounds 60.9bn) in
1992, equal to 5.5 per cent of west German GDP) will remain high for years
to come. Such financial imbalances are not sustainable over the medium term.
Hence, strict budget consolidation, with a cumulative four-year cut to bring
the structural deficit down to 2 per cent of GDP, is necessary.
Whether or not the 'solidarity pact' which political leaders agreed in
mid-March puts fiscal policy back on a sound financial path remains to be
seen. On the positive side, it is important that decisions on financial
transfers to the east and the burden-sharing in the west have finally been
taken. However, the chosen approach gives cause for concern.
Priority is being given to sharp tax increases rather than substantial
spending cuts. Direct taxes, rather than the more investment-neutral
indirect taxes, will be raised (with effect in 1995). The projected saving
measures exclude social payments, whereas curbs on financial aids (which
account for two-thirds of total subsidies) will remain relatively small.
Moreover, public indebtedness is going to increase further, as the borrowing
limits of the Treuhand and the German Bank for Reconstruction will be
raised. All this falls short of a sensible medium-term consolidation
programme. The government expects the deficit to come down substantially,
but this is based on quite optimistic assumptions on nominal GDP expansion
in the next four years and on the ability of the public sector to limit the
growth of expenditures.
With regard to wage policy, things look relatively positive in western
Germany. Recent wage settlements have been moderate and in view of high
unemployment rates wage moderation is likely to persist for a while. In
eastern Germany, however, there is cause for concern. Trade unions insist on
a rapid convergence of wages with western levels in spite of the great
productivity gap still prevailing. A damaging strike in the metal and
electrical sectors is possible next month. Fresh investment may therefore be
deterred.
Monetary policy has been gradually eased since last autumn, with the latest
cuts in Bundesbank interest rates made last Thursday. A further sharp
reduction in key rates is not recommended. Inflation is still high and after
the excessive rise last year, annual growth in the money supply (M3) has not
come down convincingly to the target range announced for 1993 (4.5 to 6.5
per cent). If the Bundesbank were to give way to pressures at home and
abroad and embark on an outright expansionary policy, it would put the
credibility of its anti-inflationary policy at risk.
It should also be recalled that expansionary monetary policies have not
proved to be particularly successful in the past in overcoming recessions,
above all when deep structural adjustments are necessary. A continued
cautious easing of monetary policy would lead to a full normalisation of the
yield curve later this year.
Germany needs a two-track strategy: consolidation on the budget side and a
medium-term supply-side policy to enable potential output to grow at a
reasonable rate. This includes trade liberalisation, deregulation and
privatisation, as well as reform of the tax system, to make it more
conducive to private investment in the context of high international capital
mobility. Germany also needs to overhaul its social welfare system, to
reduce costs and strengthen economic incentives.
There is little, if any, co-ordination between these policies and short-term
macroeconomic policies. Some measures are under way, but the government's
preferred piecemeal actions are resisted by well-organised interest groups.
The recent decision to protect, via subsidisation, so-called 'core
industries' in eastern Germany is counter-productive and will be
ineffectual.
The planned tax reductions, both on corporate profits and on earnings from
doing business, will be combined with a narrowing of depreciation
allowances. Such tax reform, if enacted, would therefore have only a minor
impact on investment. Moreover, income tax increases agreed as part of the
solidarity pact will transform Germany into a truly high-taxation country.
On trade policy, Germany still has to persuade her EC partners and the
European Commission that the successful completion of the Uruguay Round is
critical, especially in the short run, to restore business confidence about
future economic developments.

FT  26 APR 93 / Letter: Survival jeopardised by steel price rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr T F BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, What business in today's marketplace can increase its prices by more
than 40 per cent? Answer: the European steel industry.
We are a fairly typical engineering company supplying fabricated and
machined products to a variety of markets from defence to leisure. We have
survived the recession to date by prudent management and a shift in emphasis
to exports and new products. We employ 50 people. All this could be in vain
now that the steel industry is implementing a 40 per cent-plus increase in
its prices.
Our markets are extremely fragile - and our best customers refuse to accept
any price increases. So we are faced with a huge, totally unrealistic
increase which, because of our purchasing power (5 tonnes a month), we can
do little to resist and our large customers refuse to accept.
We have made inquiries in countries outside the EC to see if we can purchase
two or three months' supply from producers there. Consistently we are told
that they cannot supply or must be careful on price because EC mills may
cause problems for them. So much for a free market.
This increase - reasons for which include huge demand from China and
capacity reduction - is nothing more than the result of deliberations of a
price cartel taking no notice of the realities of the European market.
Almost certainly prices paid by China will be extremely low and we are being
asked to support the steel mill margins. Apart from being inflationary it
hits the medium and small-sized user, the bedrock of UK manufacturing
industry.
Are we to support China at the expense of the UK?

FT  26 APR 93 / Arts: Viennese alternatives - London Sinfonietta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several hundred more people were needed to fill the Queen Elizabeth Hall for
Saturday's 'Alternative Vienna' concert, by the London Sinfonietta. Nearly
all of them would have been entranced and even moved by the final work, HK
Gruber's hugely disarming Cello Concerto (1989). Most would have responded
to Kurt Schwertsik's mock-simple music too, as also to Gruber's edgily
tonal, sweet-tempered revue movement The Red Carpet is being Unrolled
(1968). They should have been there. There are four more concerts to come,
this week and next.
Only a pair of Intermezzi from the music-theatre Medea of a younger Viennese
composer, Christian Ofenbauer, let the side down. Dadaism without verve,
pointillisme with no guiding line to join the dots - and unconscionably
long: in that dim context, Ofenbauer's mildly outre instrumental effects had
no point to make.
80-odd years ago, Ravel used three non-synchronised metronomes in his
L'Heure espagnole prelude; they must come together periodically, but never
quite in synch with the tender orchestral music - a metaphor for that whole
little opera. Ofenbauer multiplied the trick interminably, and his
protracted coda for metronomes alone, one after another being switched off,
was painfully predictable.
Everything else was far better. Schwertsik's song-cycle Shal-i-mar after HC
Artmann's 'Persian Quatrains', sung freshly and eagerly by the baritone
Peter Savidge, recalls the old romantic ache of the young Berg in a
temperate new language. His octet Twilight Music, plainer still on the
surface, makes charming play with ancient Celtic jigs, in which Nona
Lidell's fiddle struck all the right notes. (Schwertsik himself was present,
and unsurprisingly he turns out to be a kind of leprechaun.)
Gruber's 20-minute Cello Concerto is a tour de force and a kind of
masterpiece. These same musicians gave its London premiere two and a half
years ago. Christopher van Kampen delivered the fiendish solo part with even
more generous warmth than before, and Lothar Zagrosek drew enchanting sounds
from Gruber's magical little ensemble, in which everything gleams.
The vibes, and the falling phrase (with a turn-up at the end) that haunts
the score, suggest an hommage to Berg's Lulu: might that have been
intentional? The phrase itself also recalls the master-tune of Szymanowski's
First Violin Concerto ' but I suppose that must be an accident. If it is,
it's a happy one.

FT  26 APR 93 / Arts: A Modernist of east and west - The work of Fumihiko
Maki, winner of the Pritzker Prize
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
He has been described as a 'New Modernist'; he is famous for his loud and
frequent laughter; his architecture is thought by some to be in the realm of
transcendental materialism; and today he joins the small band of architects
to win the Pritzker Prize. Fumihiko Maki is an architect who is often seen
as bridging the cultures of east and west because he was born in Japan in
1928 and from 1953 has spent a large part of his career in the US.
This coveted prize is often described as the Nobel prize for architecture.
It was the brainchild of Jay A. Pritzker, the president of the Hyatt
Foundation, and it has been presented annually since 1979. It is generous -
Dollars 100,000 - and the presentation ceremonies have been held at
important architectural locations all over the world. The jury is
international but inevitably there is a strong transatlantic flavour to the
award. The list of laureates is interesting: Philip Johnson; Luis Barragan;
James Stirling; Kevin Roche; IM Pei; Richard Meier; Hans Hollein; Gottfried
Boehm; Kenzo Tange; Gordon Bunshaft with Oscar Neimeyer; Frank Gehry; Aldo
Rossi; Robert Venturi; and Aalvaro Siza. Seven of the winners have been
American and many more are prominent in the academic world of architecture
which has a strong leaning towards the American schools.
There is, I think, a feeling that the award should mark the whole career of
the architect and so it is inevitable that it should have a certain
predeliction for the masters of the modern movement and their immediate
heirs. This year the jury states its view of Maki very clearly: 'He is a
modernist who has fused the best of both eastern and western cultures to
create an architecture representing the age old qualities of his native
country while at the same time juxtaposing contemporary construction methods
and materials . . . Maki has expressed his constant concern for the 'parts'
and the 'whole' describing one of his goals as achieving a dynamic
equilibrium that includes sometimes conflicting masses, volumes and
materials. He uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of
his design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a
way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony.
He uses precise detailing to give his structures rhythm and scale.'
Maki's buildings are not as well known in Europe as they are on the
American/Japanese architectural axis. His major works are all in Japan,
although he is now designing major office buildings in Munich and has a
number of commissions in the US. He is, curiously, very famous for not
winning the competition for the major new Getty museum in Los Angeles: his
entry was much favoured by many members of that jury. An important visual
arts centre project by Maki is currently under construction, which is
literally on top of the Moscone Convention Centre in the Yerba Buena Gardens
in San Francisco.
As a student Maki was much influenced by the Bauhaus and after studying at
the Harvard School of Design he worked for Skidmore, Owings and Merrill in
New York. When he returned to Japan in 1965 he became a founding member of a
group that called themselves 'The Metabolists' . They had a terrifying
philosophy of creating the largest possible megastructures as the solution
to urban architectural problems. Their ideas embraced technology and
vastness of scale as natural bedfellows and sometimes the results were built
in Japan. The great Harumi apartment block designed by Kunio Maekawa is one
of largest concrete framed blocks of flats, and it was admired by the
Metabolists for the way it fitted hundreds of little traditional Japanese
houses into a Corbusian block. Kikutake's Sea City and Tange's plan for a
megastructure for the whole of Tokyo Bay were the most extreme examples.
Many of the Metabolist's ideas were taken up by mad groups like Archigram in
England or Paolo Soleri's collectives in Arizona. Today it all has a sad
period feel and Metabolism is rightly seen as a dire example of a modern
architectural megalomania.
Maki clearly recovered from this moment of madness and in his famous
Hillside Terrace apartments in Tokyo he demonstrates successfully the
virtues of small-scale town planning. I saw recently his Tokyo Metropolitan
Gymnasium, which is a giant of a building but has a strange, anthropomorphic
presence that is very powerful. His Spiral Building, which is part of the
Wacoal Arts Centre in Tokyo, has an elegance and an invisible mastery of
technology that is masterful. I particularly enjoyed the games he plays with
the language of modernism in the Tepia Science Centre in Tokyo full of
refences to De Stijl and reinterpretations of the dead language of cubism.
The greatest influence on Maki is probably the late work of Eero Saarinen in
the US. Both architects have the same fascination with new shapes and a
certain clarity combined with innovation when it comes to structure.
Contemporary Japanese architecture is not specifically eastern or western
and I feel it is wrong to think of architects like Maki as important
cultural 'bridges'. Architecture in Japan is undoubtedly contemporary but in
a more timeless way than fashionable contemporary western architecture. Maki
does for architecture what Japanese manufacturing has done for cars and
electronics. He makes technology and structure work for the user; and so his
architecture remains cool and often elegant as a setting for modern life.
His best buildings have a quality of stability that is very rare and
rewarding in modern architecture.

FT  26 APR 93 / Arts: Kathleen Ferrier Awards - Singing competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prize money at the Kathleen Ferrier Awards has gone up again this year.
No doubt there is good reason in trying to keep the competition itself in
first place ahead of its rivals - but the result is not necessarily as
intended.
A five-figure first prize does not just bring in high-quality students. It
is enough to lure young professional singers, who could not earn as much in
a couple of evenings otherwise. The result was a selection of finalists more
experienced than in previous years, who fitted in the competition before
flying off to engagements at San Francisco or La Scala, Milan (I jest not -
the biographies of the eight touched that level).
The main culprit is the Cardiff Singer of the World competition, which has
pitched its sights at the international level, luring away the public's
attention and a lot of the available finance. Other competitions have either
closed down or been forced to raise their game. A gap has opened up, leaving
the young, unfinished singer of 23 or 24 who really needs the money without
much chance of winning a major award.
Against that background the jury of this year's Ferrier Awards (chaired by
Janet Baker) did a good job. The first prize went to Ruby Philogene, who was
a finalist last year, but re-appeared at the Wigmore Hall on Friday much
advanced. Her richly-coloured mezzo was better focused; her artistry was
more mature, filling out the long lines of her aria from Massenet's Werther
with skill and heartfelt emotion. She was the right choice - by a whisker.
Second prize was taken by the mezzo Sara Fulgoni, already noted as a major
talent at the Royal Northern College of Music. The size and range of her
voice are remarkable. Had she sung her two songs at the final with a bit
more variety of colour, she might have won. Ruth Peel, a contralto generous
in tone, less forthcoming with words, came third. That left no prize for the
baritone Peter Snipp, who had taken command of the stage with unabashed
professionalism.
In contrast, the soprano Eldrydd Cynan-Jones and tenor Toby Spence gave
notice of genuine promise, deserving of recognition. There was no
accompanists' prize this year (has it been dropped?) but with one or two
exceptions the standard in that department was poor, as the jury rightly
noted.

FT  26 APR 93 / Arts: The Who's Tommy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Broadway careened into the video age last week with the opening of The Who's
Tommy, a spectacular new musical theatre version of the classic 1969 rock
opera that is as addictively watchable - and as troublingly meaningless - as
MTV music television.
Former Who member Pete Townshend, who wrote the music and lyrics, and
director Des McInuff, have bolstered the narrative for this version which is
playing at the St James Theatre, but the story's basic outline remains the
same as the original.
A young British boy sees his father shoot his mother's lover and turns
catatonic when his parents force him to suppress the experience. The 'deaf,
dumb and blind kid' is subjected to myriad unsuccessful cures, sexually
abused by his uncle and harassed by his streetkid cousin. As a teenager,
Tommy becomes a 'pinball wizard' and is declared a genius. He snaps out of
his daze when his mother smashes the mirror into which he constantly stares.
This miraculous recovery makes him a media superstar, but he eventually
rejects the adulation as meaningless.
The musical represents Tommy's estrangement from his environment by having
Michael Cerveris, the rich-voiced and otherworldly-looking actor who plays
the full-grown Tommy, appear on stage to voice the inner experience of
himself at ages four and ten, played by two younger actors, before he takes
over the action midway through the first act. It is characteristic of
McInuff's high octane direction that Tommy can fly. He bounds ten feet in
the air to land on top of the mirrored wardrobe in which his younger self
stares, and somersaults from the top of the proscenium to the middle of the
stage (all supported by discreetly efficient wires).
Tommy's excellent staging is at its best in the overture, an expositional
masterwork which, through Wayne Cilento's exuberant choreography, state of
the art technology and stagecraft, tells a story that it would take pages of
dialogue to communicate. It is filled with visual shorthand as when
uniformed actors enact an air lift by jumping through an unseen hole in the
stage floor as hundreds of tiny paratrooper images appear on a screen
covering the front of the stage.
John Arnone's spare set consists of a series of girders which frame the
proscenium, and a few set pieces representing internal location. Crucial to
the production's visual effect is a multi-panelled wall of video screens
filling the back wall of the stage. The screens flash images which provide
settings and comment on the action, representing Tommy's experience.
Diehard Who fans will probably find it jarring to hear the beloved
rock'n'roll hymns of their adolescence played by a full orchestra and sung
by 27 trained voices, but the score remains as vital as ever.
Tommy bombards the audience with so much aural and visual stimulation that
there is little time to wonder what it all means. It is a story that
probably made much more sense in the marijuana cloud of the late 1960s.
Broadly, it is concerned with the difficulty of leading an emotionally
complete life in an uncompassionate, abusive society in which reality and
relativity are distorted by the media. These are themes that have increased
in relevance in the several decades since Tommy was written, but the
production seems less interested in investigating these troubling ideas than
in glossing over them.
Anything menacing about the story is played down; pains are taken in casting
and direction to make the characters whose actions might seem reprehensible
appear sympathetic. Uncle Ernie (Paul Kandell) is an alcoholic who cannot
control his impulses; Tommy's parents (Jonathan Dokuchitz and Marcia
Mitzman) are a good-looking middle-class couple; the murder and subsequent
denial which set the story in motion are made out to be an understandable
crime of passion, soon forgotten.
Clearly the forces behind this production were more excited by Tommy's music
and its visual possibilities than its message. They chose to dress up the
story in the trappings of a Broadway musical - and what trappings they are]
 -but, although it feels great at the time, eventually, there is nothing
there.

BBC2 begins a week of 10-minute programmes commenting upon 40 of the 'best'
(whatever that means) pictures in British art galleries. Today in the first
episode of The Great Picture Trail Neil MacGregor, director of the National
Gallery, presents his choice of of eight, beginning with Titian's 'Three
Ages Of Man'. The paintings were selected for 'Sainsbury's Pictures For
Schools', a scheme providing 750 schools with framed prints and videos
(7.20). The expensive bickering between British Airways and Virgin
continues. World In Action reports on the price war between the two airlines
and the 'dirty tricks' campaign alleged to have been waged by BA (ITV 8.30).
Channel 4 launches a sequence of documentaries about television around the
world, Channels of Resistance (10.55) starts with 'Distress Signals' which
advances the well-worn thesis that television is becoming global without
becoming international: 'The danger is that one national style, the
American, will be imposed on all others with disastrous consequences for
indigenous production'.

FT  26 APR 93 / Arts: Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor - Shakespeare in
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sam Wanamaker's grand design of a faithfully reconstructed Globe Theatre
close to the original site took another step forward at the weekend with a
production of Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor by the Bremer Shakespeare
Company.
The weather on Friday was not kind, but not quite cruel enough to prevent
the show going through to the end. If the sun had shone, the superlatives in
this piece would be even stronger. For I do not share the general British
scepticism that Wanamaker is pursuing a heroic endeavour doomed not to come
off. He has been at it now for over 20 years and the arguments for what he
is trying to achieve become stronger with time.
In the first place, the international audience for Shakespeare is greater
than the British. There are imitation Globe Theatres strewn around the
world, though none with the advantage that could accrue to one set in the
heart of Shakespeare's London.
The site is on the south bank of the Thames more or less midway between the
Royal National Theatre on the same side of the river and the Royal
Shakespeare Company's Barbican home not far across the waterway. All three
sites are just about within walking distance of each other, and would be
even more comfortably so if Wanamaker's further dream of a pedestrian bridge
across the river were realised.
The concentration of three theatres in broadly the same area would add to
the attraction, especially to foreign visitors. Both the RNT and the RSC
stand to benefit from the Globe going ahead.
I also think that Shakespeare is very good in German, as the Bremer
production, brought to us in association with the Goethe-Institut, showed.
As we have already seen from the Schiller Theater's interpretation of
Macbeth, the Germans take a less deferential approach to Shakespeare than
some of our own directors. That does not mean that they are always right,
but it does help to demonstrate the Bard's infinite variety.
Die lustigen Weiber (or in other words The Merry Wives of Windsor) is a
perfect example. Some of the language and contemporary allusions are hard
enough to understand in English. But it is a marvellous comedy designed to
take liberties with, which perhaps explains why it has been the base for
several operas.
The Bremer production looked as if it had added components especially for
London. Characters carry their bits and pieces in Harrods bags. A search for
a marriage partner is pursued by consulting the (obviously newly introduced)
agony column in the Evening Standard. When things go wrong, as in Friday's
conditions frequently they did, the characters address the audience in
English.
There is a cast of only five - true to the Shakespeare tradition, all men.
One of the revelations is that it is the arms rather than the legs that tell
the men from the women. Erik Rossbander is a splendid Anne Page, almost
better when just gesturing than when speaking.
The triumph is Norbert Kentrup's Falstaff. The Germans do these things on
the grand scale. No padding is required - we know this because for much of
the time he wears a see-through nightshirt: he is just enormous, bigger even
than Helmut Kohl, and remarkably good natured to boot. Note his entrance,
dripping wet, after the interval, having just been thrown in the river,
which in this case is conveniently nearby. Whether you understand German
becomes immaterial.
*****
The Bremer company specialises in Shakespeare and has done 17 productions
since it was founded 10 years ago. Possibly The Merry Wives, which is
largely in prose, is a natural for a British audience. One wonders what it
would do with As You Like It, the RSC's production having arrived at the
Barbican from Stratford.
David Thacker's direction is notably austere, almost to the point of
removing the comedy. But there is is one wonderful performance by Kate
Buffery as Rosalind, the heroine who dresses as a boy in pursuit of her
love. At times she commands the entire, almost bare stage, and could equally
well be the hero. Every Shakespeare production is different. That is why we
can take more. The Globe Theatre could become a permanent fixture in a year,
given another Pounds 2m.

Nigel Lester, who heads County NatWest Investment Management, is leaving for
personal reasons, but has been asked by the board of NatWest Markets to stay
on for another three months while a successor is found.
The fund management operation has been hit by a string of departures, with
two other senior figures quitting just recently. David Gamble, deputy chief
executive, has left to run the British Airways Pension Fund, and Bruce
Pullman, who was in charge of quantitative product development, is moving to
Hill Samuel Life and Investment Management.
County denies that these departures are connected or reflect changing
fortunes of the operation. Total funds under management last year rose from
Pounds 12.6bn to Pounds 14bn.
Lester, 40, had been at County for three years.

FT  26 APR 93 / People: Chatham House plugs environment gap
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Institute of International Affairs, Britain's premier
foreign-policy think tank, has plugged an embarrassing gap at the top of its
research staff by promoting Michael Grubb, 33, to be director of its energy
and environment programme.
Grubb, who has worked at the Royal Institute's Chatham House headquarters
since October 1988, replaces Gerald Pollio. The latter had been hired in
July 1992 from Chemical Bank - where he had been a senior adviser on energy
 -to take over from the widely respected Jonathan Stern.
Under Stern the institute had made quite a name for itself in the energy and
environment world. Its programme has twice as many corporate sponsors as any
other in the institute and Pollio's abrupt departure after less than six
months in the job led to a leadership vacuum in an important part of Chatham
House's research effort.
Grubb, previously at Imperial College and the Cavendish Laboratories,
Cambridge, has been the energy and environment programme's senior
researcher. His appointment means that the research programme can return to
normal.
The Institute is scheduled to publish next Wednesday three of the pieces of
research which have been held up. These include a 200-page analysis of the
Rio Earth Summit Agreements from last June; a 100-page report on
environmental profiles of European business; and a report on the current
stalled state of EC climate policy.

FT  26 APR 93 / People: Consultant picks up the reins at Exco
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Lacy, one of the best known figures in the global money broking
business, is handing over the chief executive's reigns at Exco International
to Ron Sandler, a 41-year-old management consultant.
Lacy, who joined Exco in 1966 as a trainee broker and tea-maker, may be only
45 but he comes from a sector of the financial services industry where
executives tend to retire before 50.
A popular figure with staff, Lacy has helped keep Exco on an even keel
following the collapse of its parent, the British and Commonwealth empire,
in 1988. He tried to mount a management buy-out of Exco from the B&amp;C
administrators in 1990, but this came to nothing and in July 1991 he handed
over the chairmanship to Carel Mosselmans, a former chairman of Sedgwick
group.
Last summer the administrators sold 60 per cent of Exco's shares to a group
of institutions and the intention is to refloat the company on the stock
market. Lacy has now decided to lighten his workload and move up to be
deputy chairman.
Ron Sandler, Exco's new chief executive, comes from a very different
background. After Cambridge and Stanford, where he got his MBA, Sandler
worked first for Boston Consulting and then became managing director of the
UK operations of Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton, before running his own consultancy
for a period.
At the end of 1990, he was introduced to the money-broking world after one
of his clients, Citibank, sought his help in recovering money lent to Gary
Klesch's Quadrex, owners of Martin Bierbaum, another money-broker. Sandler
took over as chief executive and reshaped the Bierbaum group so that it
could be sold to David Hagan's Trio Investments at the end of 1992.
Sandler, who takes over a business roughly twice as big as Martin Bierbaum,
dismisses suggestions that he has been brought in to Exco for a similar
mission. He says Exco has a good cash flow and a strong position in the
three time-zones in which it operates.
Meanwhile, Exco has also announced that Richard Jackson, 45, previously
president of RMJ Securities, Exco's US treasury bond inter-dealer broker,
has been appointed chairman of RMJ and retires from the Exco board.

<TEXT>
Being made redundant is not such a big deal, according to John Rauwerda,
fiscal manager at the Foundation for San Francisco's Architectural Heritage.
For him it was a blessing in disguise.
As in the UK, executives in the US have recently discovered that redundancy
is not a malaise restricted solely to the ranks of the blue-collar worker.
But Americans are finding increasingly that being a temporary executive has
its perks.
Rauwerda is one of thousands of executives who fell foul of recessionary
layoffs and then found another position after a period as a 'flexecutive'.
With more than 30m Americans employed as either temporary workers,
part-timers or independent contractors, the contingent workforce has become
one of the fastest-growing sectors of employment in America and accounts for
more than 25 per cent of civilian jobs.
'I had been working on a temporary assignment at the Foundation for four
months when they offered me a permanent position,' says Rauwerda, 'I took it
because it gave me security.'
For those who sit in wait for their next permanent role, becoming a
flexecutive has advantages. According to Tom Johnston of New York-based
Interim Executive Services, approximately 52 per cent of temporary
executives receive permanent job offers. In addition, interim employment
eliminates gaping voids on a CV and broadens one's skill base.
Not everyone regards temporary employment as a stop-gap. Amy Ross presently
heads up the benefits unit at Lifescan, a nationwide medical monitoring
manufacturer. Ross left the permanent job market because she sought greater
freedom and flexibility.
'I was burned out and my former role was too demanding. This way I'm more in
control,' she says. Ross, who spent two months travelling with her family
recently, says that she would not accept a permanent job if it was offered
to her.
But Ross is fortunate in that temporary employment suits her lifestyle.
Others are resigned to a career in temporary executive roles because they do
not see the employment market supplying sufficient opportunity for them to
return to the permanent positions they would prefer.
In the present economic climate there are advantages for companies in
favouring temporary recruitment, especially at the higher echelons of
management where perks are expensive. Temporary employees do not receive
holiday pay, maternity leave, health care insurance, pension plans or sick
leave.
It is largely for this reason that the incidence of temporary employment
rises towards the end of a recession when companies find they have been too
eager with the paring knife and need certain skills on board, but cannot
afford a permanent executive.
Small companies as well as large have been attracted towards the ever
increasing pool of executive expertise on the marketplace. Many have used
temporary skills to cover for under-staffing caused by maternity leave,
sabbaticals or overly enthusiastic redundancy programmes.
Says Don Muller, the director of client services for lawyers Thelen, Marrin,
Johnson and Bridges: 'I bring in the level of expertise I need, when I need
it.' Muller now finds that while his permanent staff is on the decrease, his
use of flexecutives is on the increase and there is rarely a time when he
does not have at least two temporary top managers on the payroll.
Muller stresses the financial advantages for companies are enormous.
Recently, he employed a specialist to set up a new communications system
within the company, at a rate of Dollars 100 (Pounds 65) an hour.
The project took seven weeks, and the individual worked a 20-hour week,
costing Dollars 14,000. 'Had I employed her full-time, her level of
expertise would have warranted a Dollars 120,000 annual salary,' explains
Muller.
Recent reports by the Bureau of Labour Statistics suggest that the growing
army of 'discouraged workers' in the US (resigned to never securing another
permanent job) has reached 1m, while the temporary professional sector is
the fastest growing segment of the temporary-worker industry, generating
Dollars 70m per annum.

FT  26 APR 93 / Management: Big changes to take on board - After 10 years
fighting the old boy network, Pro Ned now faces questions about its own
future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Amstrad, the UK electronics group headed by Alan Sugar, advertised late
last year for the appointment of two non-executive directors, Colin St
Johnston was entitled to indulge in an ironic smile.
As managing director of Pro Ned, the organisation for the promotion of
non-executive directors which co-ordinated the recruitment, he was
witnessing the remarkable alliance of a vocal advocate for reform of
corporate governance with a company criticised for its failure to embrace
the topic.
A decade after it began producing annual reviews, Pro Ned retains an
evangelical slant, calling regularly for an end to the 'old boy network' for
appointments, and providing booklets and hosting conferences to promote
better boardroom practice. But some are now questioning whether it should
continue in its current form.
Pro Ned came into being in 1981 with the backing of nine sponsors including
the Bank of England, the Confederation of British Industry and the Stock
Exchange. Its first, typewritten annual review in 1983 may have since been
replaced by rather more glossy production techniques. But its objectives
have remained almost unchanged.
The first and primary aim was 'to create a climate of opinion in which
boards perceive that it is in their own interest to put their house in
order'. That meant promoting independent non-executive directors and
encouraging the split of roles between chairman and chief executive.
The second aim was to create a search service to help companies find these
directors. In 1983, Pro Ned estimated that just 5 per cent were selected
through search firms while three-quarters came through the personal
recommendations of the chairman, company directors or senior management.
One senior executive with knowledge of the organisation says: 'It worries me
that Pro Ned lacks a clarity of purpose and focus and is not as commercial
as it might be.' He cites the dominance of representatives of associations
rather than working business executives on the Pro Ned board.
Peter Waine, joint chief executive of Hanson Green, a search firm for
non-executive directors which claims to place nearly half the estimated
600-700 vacancies a year, has 'a lot of respect' for Pro Ned. 'But I think
it has probably lost its purpose as an appointments agency. It should stick
to being a professional institute.'
Of the 850 people on Pro Ned's register, 60 per cent are 55 or older, and
just 10 per cent are women. Many names stay on the register for years
without being selected. Waine says the register is too reactive, and offers
candidates 'in the twilight of their careers' who are too reliant on
non-executive remuneration to act independently.
But St Johnston argues that Pro Ned actively canvasses for new names, and
does not 'purge' its list too ruthlessly because candidates who have been
untouched for years can suddenly be requested. He stresses that companies
hunting for non-executives can consult the register without identifying
themselves, and in the knowledge that candidates will be available.
Less controversy surrounds Pro Ned's primary aim. 'The promotion of
non-executives was one area in which there was no division between the City
and industry,' says Jonathon Charkham, adviser to the governors of the Bank
of England and Pro Ned's first director in 1981-85.
Sir Adrian Cadbury, Pro Ned's chairman, says: 'Pro Ned has established
itself as the one really independent source of advice and has become an
accepted authority. Everyone else has an axe to grind. But we have an
enormous job still to do to make directors more independent and more
effective.'
There is little doubt that there has been tremendous change in the last
decade. According to figures from Hemmington Scott, the corporate
information company, all FTSE-100 companies now have non-executive
directors, as do all but 8 per cent of the 1,533 UK-quoted companies
excluding investment trusts. Four-fifths have split the roles of chairman
and chief executive.
By contrast, a survey by the Bullock Committee showed that one quarter of
the Times 1,000 companies had no non-executive directors in 1976. Even in
1982, a Bank of England survey showed 20 per cent without any on the board.
How far Pro Ned was responsible for this change is difficult to assess.
Other organisations and some regulators in the UK and overseas have
influenced changes in corporate governance.
Charkham cites at least one instance of a Pro Ned-generated idea: that
quoted companies should publish details of the backgrounds of non-executive
directors in their annual reports. That was taken up by the Stock Exchange,
and is now a listing requirement.
A more fundamental question is whether Pro Ned's campaigning zeal has been
focused in the right direction. Most evidence on corporate governance is
dangerously anecdotal. A recent analysis by Hemmington Scott suggests that
there is little correlation between long-term corporate performance and the
presence of non-executives or the separation of chairmen and chief
executives.
Equally, some argue that the organisation has focused on topics on which
there is considerable consensus while neglecting more controversial but
important issues, such as the scope for two-tier or supervisory boards.
Sir Adrian says: 'That is an important question but let's not divert
attention from what needs to be done here and now.' He admits that there is
a tension between the campaigning and the recruitment roles of the
organisation, and says he will be drawing up options for his successor
before retiring from the board next year.

FT  26 APR 93 / Management: Are two heads better than one?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEX RENFIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Are we in danger of going overboard on corporate governance? No one
challenges the concept or the objectives - but who is counting the cost?
Ultimately, are shareholders getting added value?
For example, splitting the roles of chairman and chief executive can be
expensive, particularly at executive level. Two salaries for what was
previously one job is the starting point. And how often is the chief
executive reimbursed at a lower level than his predecessor, who had been
handling the dual role? Even a part-time chairman will, almost inevitably,
bring an additional burden to the payroll.
The hidden costs are more difficult to identify and justify. Decision making
with one ultimate arbitrator should be straightforward. A decision with
split roles can be time-consuming but the outcome is unlikely to be
materially different or more profound from two minds than from one.
Another issue arises over communicating with the City, a process that the
chairman is duty-bound to lead. Yet it is the chief executive who really
knows the business, and it is he who fund managers wish to hear. I suspect
that this will not be easy for many chairmen to accept.
Many senior executives are frustrated with the challenge of working for two
masters, particularly if they worked closely with someone combining
efficiently the two roles. If a company has in place a well qualified,
independent set of non-executive directors, are further safeguards
necessary? If arm's-length committees covering audit, renumeration and so on
are in place and working efficiently, will the horrors of the past be
repeated?
When too much power lies in one person's grasp, then the likelihood of
fraud, dishonesty and variations on those themes is always a danger. But
executives and companies of the highest integrity will always outnumber
those with the propensity to go off the rails. It should not be necessary,
as a matter of course, for every company to split the chairman and chief
executive.
In providing such safeguards companies are often wasting hundreds of
thousands of pounds.
It is time to think again, to analyse the practical implementations and to
consider carefully whether we really are creating a better, safer corporate
world.
The author is employed at a senior level in an FT-SE company.

RESULTS DUE
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the UK's biggest manufacturer, reports its
first-quarter results on Thursday in the crucial run-up to the flotation of
Zeneca, its bioscience subsidiary.
Analysts expect pre-tax profits of about Pounds 180m compared with about
Pounds 211m for the same period last year.
They will be looking at the extent of the impact of the slowdown in
continental Europe, particularly in fibres, as well as the upturn in films
polyurethanes and acrylics in the US.
As for Zeneca, the rate of decline in US sales of Tenormin following the
expiry of its patents will also studied. So, too, will the impact of the
reform of the EC's common agricultural policy on European agrochemicals.
Sears, the UK retail group that includes the Selfridges department store and
a large slice of the UK's shoe shops, is generally forecast to announce
pre-tax profits of about Pounds 97m to Pounds 100m tomorrow before
exceptional items of about Pounds 73m.
That would represent an improvement on last year's pre-exceptional Pounds
96.3m, although some forecasts are as low as Pounds 90m. The exceptional
costs this year include about Pounds 32m for rationalising the footwear
operations of British Shoe Corporation, other restructuring and redundancy
costs, and a write-off for the sale of the Galliford housebuilding division.
Tarmac is expected to announce pre-tax losses of up to Pounds 355m when it
announces its 1992 results tomorrow. The company is widely expected to adopt
the FRS 3 accounting standard which means that provisions of more than
Pounds 300m will be taken above the line. The final dividend of 5.5p is
expected to be maintained.
The market will want to know what progress the company's disposal programme
is making, particularly the planned sale of its waste disposal business.
Analysts will also want to hear from Mr Neville Simms, chief executive,
about progress the group is making in the recently renascent UK housing
market.

FT  26 APR 93 / Economics: Clear end to UK recession expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY'S release of the provisional estimate of first quarter GDP figures in
the UK will mark the clear end of a recession that began almost three years
ago.
Economists say manufacturing output will be the driving force behind the
rise, having increased strongly so far this year.
There will be more clues to the strength of the UK's economic recovery in
the Confederation of British Industry's quarterly industrial trends survey
tomorrow, generally a good guide to future trends in manufacturing.
But while the news in the UK might be good, the world's economic problems
will be taxing the minds of G7 finance ministers and central bank governors
when they meet in Washington on the eve of the IMF's Policy Making Interim
Committee meeting.
Other economic highlights and figures this week follow. The figures in

FT  26 APR 93 / Furniture union votes for merger
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE furniture union FTAT has voted to merge with the GMB general union.
Delegates at the union's Blackpool conference at the weekend voted
overwhelmingly for merger in principle and, by a narrow margin, to link up
with the GMB rather than the TGWU transport and general union.
The GMB had argued that merging with it, rather than the TGWU, carried
greater industrial logic in terms of relations with employers in the
furniture, construction and building materials sectors.
The FTAT had held talks with other unions, including the MSF technical
union. The FTAT, with about 32,000 members, lost 10 per cent of its
membership last year.
The union was once thought likely to merge with the Ucatt construction
union, but talks were called off.
The FTAT and GMB are now expected to begin detailed merger talks. The FTAT
is likely to seek the status of a section in the union rather than lose its
identity.

FT  26 APR 93 / Patten threatens teachers on tests
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT would consider changing the law to stop teachers in England
and Wales boycotting national school tests, Mr John Patten, the education
secretary, confirmed yesterday.
'I've ruled nothing in and I've ruled nothing out,' he said on ITV's Walden
programme. 'We've come to no decision whatsoever about whether to
legislate.' But he stressed he would prefer not to legislate and that he
favoured persuasion.
Mr Patten said he would study the detail of Friday's Appeal Court judgment
upholding the legality of the teachers' boycott as a lawful trade dispute
over excessive workloads created by the reforms.
It was important for the government to 'look and reflect' for a few days and
decide on possible action, he said. 'A very good maxim in government is
'legislate in haste and repent at leisure'.'
Mr Patten appealed to teachers to think very carefully before boycotting the
tests and 'introducing industrial turmoil into our classrooms'. A boycott
would damage pupils, parents and the professional standing of teachers, he
said.

FT  26 APR 93 / Government tests on food 'unreliable and inaccurate'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT tests for pesticide contamination in food were condemned as
unreliable and often inaccurate yesterday after tests were performed by
commercial laboratories on foods which were deliberately spiked.
The Food Commission said it had obtained Ministry of Agriculture documents
which raised 'disturbing doubts' about the accuracy of government
contamination figures.
The documents showed that the government's food science laboratory sent
foods deliberately spiked with pesticides to more than 50 commercial
laboratories which it uses to carry out scientific analysis.
In one test, bread was spiked with three pesticides. But only 44 of the 58
laboratories identified all three contaminants, while seven identified
pesticides that were not present.
In a second test, beef fat was contaminated with four pesticides, but only
18 of the 58 laboratories isolated all four, while 10 identified pesticides
which were not present.
There were also variations in the amount of contamination, the commission
said.
Mr Peter Beaumont, of the watchdog Pesticides Trust, said: 'We have grave
doubts about the reliability of the testing procedures being used by the
government.'

FT  26 APR 93 / Companies resist accounting campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES are still resisting the Accounting Standards Board's campaign to
outlaw extraordinary items, according to a survey by Company Reporting, the
monthly monitor of annual accounts.
The analysis showed that during the past 12 months 39 per cent of a sample
of 570 companies continued to use extraordinary items. For accounts
published in the first quarter of this year, the proportion was 32 per cent.
Extraordinary items are income or expenditure outside the normal activities
of a company that are not treated as part of earnings on the profit and loss
account. Their continued widespread use comes in spite of standards issued
in late 1991 by the Accounting Standards Board, which argued that very few
items should be classified in this way.
The new rules do not become mandatory for financial year-ends until June
this year, but the board has been keen to encourage companies to comply as
quickly as possible.
Those companies still using extraordinary items in their latest accounts
include Lonrho, the international trading conglomerate, Thorn EMI, the
entertainment group, and Reckitt &amp; Colman, the household products company.
The majority of those aspects classified as extraordinary were profits and
losses on disposals and discontinuance, reorganisation and redundancy. The
study shows that the number of companies using extraordinaries has fallen
from 53 per cent two years ago.

FT  26 APR 93 / Barclays chief warns of bank lending curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH street banks' lending to small businesses may be under threat unless
the government helps them to widen loan margins and restore their
profitability, Sir Peter Middleton, deputy chairman of Barclays Bank, has
warned.
In one of the strongest warnings yet about the danger of a 'credit crunch',
Sir Peter said it would 'not be very surprising if the banking system became
risk-averse in a big way when a need comes for finance for the recovery'.
Sir Peter's remarks at a lecture given to public-relations practitioners in
London follow widespread concern that banks' losses on small-business
lending in the late 1980s will lead them to restrict lending over the next
few years.
Although bankers have denied this, Sir Peter argued that 'whatever may be
said, there are some areas of lending that are clearly under threat'  - even
though 'money is always available at a price.
'It is not totally clear that lending to small businesses can earn returns
sufficient to allow for the risks,' he told members of the Institute of
Public Relations.
Banks have suffered big losses on small-business lending over the past two
years, and Sir Peter's bank made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 242m last year
after provisions for bad and doubtful loans in the UK of Pounds 1.96bn.
Sir Peter's remarks follow a call from Mr Brian Pearse, Midland chief
executive, in February for measures such as a 'loan support scheme' giving
subsidies for small-business loans.
Sir Peter said the government should follow the example of the US government
and the Federal Reserve in helping banks to widen their margins in order to
help them to raise profitability and maintain lending in recovery.
The Fed has helped US banks to restore depleted capital by establishing a
gap between money market interest rates and short-term bond yields. That has
allowed banks to increase their capital by buying government bonds.
However, the Bank of England has indicated that it is not likely to try to
imitate that. Banks have limited incentive to use money-market funds to buy
Treasury gilts at present as the yield on such bonds is not high enough.
Sir Peter said banks needed 'some of the same attitude and some of the same
understanding' on the part of the British government. He said banks had made
mistakes in the late 1980s after the relaxation of credit control. Many
'took on excess amounts of risky assets and mistook the result for profits'
only to suffer loan losses later.
Unemployment is set to rise by another 210,000 and will peak at about 3.15m
by March next year, National Westminster Bank predicted yesterday.
Interest rates may also be cut by half a percentage point to 5.5 per cent in
the summer - but the government will have to backtrack and increase rates to
perhaps 7 per cent by next summer, said Mr David Kern, chief economist.
In spite of the fall over the past two months, unemployment will continue to
grow with the south-east bearing the brunt, he said. Joblessness in the
south-east will increase by 94,000 and reach 1.034m by next spring, he
predicted.

FT  26 APR 93 / Legal advice in custody criticised
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FEWER THAN one in four people in police custody who request legal advice see
a solicitor, the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice said yesterday.
Most are seen by untrained, inexperienced staff - untrained clerks or former
police officers or, less often, a trainee solicitor - and many receive
incorrect advice. Very few know their adviser is unqualified.
A report by the commission challenges claims by the police that defence
advisers counsel clients to remain silent under questioning to win
acquittals. It says only one in five suspects were advised to stay silent.
Nearly half were told to co-operate, while a further 31 per cent were given
no advice.
Clients were generally advised to stay silent as a precaution because
investigating officers refused to give information about their suspicions.
The researchers, from Warwick University, spent six months observing
interviews at police stations with clients of 17 large criminal legal aid
firms in London and eight other cities and towns in the north, north-west,
Midlands and East Anglia.
They also shadowed freelance advisers - mostly ex-police officers - from
three agencies used by defence solicitors to give cover at police stations.
No attempt was made to match the seriousness of a case with the experience
of advisers, the report said. Clerks were found to advise in cases involving
murder, unlawful killing, robbery, aggravated burglary and arson, as well as
small thefts, criminal damage, driving and public order offences.
In almost half the cases, advisers spent less than 10 minutes in private
consultation with their client.
This meant most legal representatives agreed to police interviewing clients
though they knew little about what the client might tell officers.
Safeguards to stop compliant individuals making false or unjustified
confessions were inadequate, the researchers said, and the right to silence
should be strengthened rather than weakened.

MR Richard Caborn, chairman of the Commons trade and industry committee has
accused the government of subverting the authority of parliament in its
handling of the coal crisis. He made the charge because of the way MPs were
denied the opportunity to vote on his committee's report on the crisis. The
government's coal white paper, published last month, largely passed over the

Interviewed in the church's magazine Life and Work, published yesterday, he

He added: 'The idea that the Church should not be involved in politics is
not sustainable in terms of the gospel as I understand it.'

BRITISH companies have turned to benchmarking in the past five years to
measure their performance internally and against competitors, and 80 per
cent of them believe it has been of benefit.
These are two of the main findings of a report published today by the
Confederation of British Industry, based on a Gallup survey for the CBI's
national manufacturing council and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm.
Gallup questioned 1,000 of the UK's largest companies - 50 per cent of them
involved in manufacturing.
Some 67 per cent of the companies claimed to be using benchmarking; more
than 90 per cent said it acted as a catalyst for change and none felt it had
been unsuccessful.

FT  26 APR 93 / Norway gas talks may hit impasse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TALKS between Britain and Norway resume today on the ratification of a
NKr20bn (Pounds 1.89bn) gas import deal agreed two years ago amid fears that
they may have reached an impasse, Karen Fossli writes.
The deal involves National Power, the electricity generator, buying 2.2bn cu
m of gas over 15 years from the mid-1990s from GFU, Norway's gas negotiating
committee.
National Power wants the gas to fuel two power stations to produce 1,300MW
of electricity. The deal would require an amendment to a treaty to allow new
gas to flow through the Frigg pipeline which runs between the Norwegian
North Sea Frigg gas field and St Fergus in Aberdeenshire.

FT  26 APR 93 / British Gas break-up opposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GAS Consumers Council has warned the government against breaking up
British Gas into separate companies as proposed by Ofgas, the industry
regulator.
Mr James Cooper, council chairman, said: 'No case has yet been made for
radical and irreversible restructuring.'
In the council's annual report published today, Mr Cooper says any
restructuring should show benefits for the consumer: 'Competition just for
the sake of competition is no reason for change.'
Proposals to break up British Gas are being considered by the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission, which is due to report in July.
The council said complaints from consumers about British Gas fell by 14 per
cent last year to 19,281 - the biggest drop since 1989. The council said
British Gas's reorganisation into district centres had led to improved
customer service.
But Ofgas registered an 89 per cent increase in complaints to 1,624 in its
annual report in February.
The disparity appears to result from Ofgas's higher public profile, which
has meant more complaints being directed towards it, rather than a rise in
consumer dissatisfaction.

FT  26 APR 93 / Observer moves to prepare the ground for changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECULATION at the end of last week that Lonrho, the international
conglomerate, was about to sell the Observer Sunday newspaper to The
Independent, continued yester-day.
This was in spite of a vigorous denial of such a possible sale in the
Observer's editorial column yesterday.
The editorial dismissed as 'mischievous and irresponsible' reports last
Friday that Lonrho, owner of the title for 12 years, has decided to sell it
to Newspaper Publishing, owner of The Independent and its sister Sunday
title.
The Observer's editorial confirmed what had long been suspected - that
Lonrho has 'received a number of offers' for the newspaper, which was first
established in 1791 and is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper.
Nor did the editorial sound completely convinced that, were the Observer
sold to Newspaper Publishing, it would not be merged with the Independent on
Sunday and cease publication as a separate title. The editorial said: 'If
Lonrho were to sell the Observer - and the if must be stressed - we do not
believe that they would do so without safeguarding the newspaper's future
and ensuring that its most precious asset, its distinctive voice and values
forged over two centuries of publication, were maintained.'
The editorial seemed to be attempting to prepare the ground for a sale by
spelling out the advantages of joining forces with a daily newspaper. It
claimed that the Observer's financial difficulties were mainly due to it
being a one-day-a-week publication while having to bear seven-day overheads.
Observer journalists have written to Mr Tiny Rowland, joint Lonrho chief
executive with Mr Dieter Bock, asking him not to sell to Newspaper
Publishing but to The Guardian, which, the letter said, 'would be a more
effective guarantor of the paper's identity and character than any other
bidder'.
The letter to Mr Rowland added: 'Since Lonrho took over the Observer in 1981
you have frequently expressed your affection for the paper, and we thank you
for the investment that has enabled us to survive in a highly competitive
environment. We hope that you will not mark your relinquishing of control by
closing us down. Britain cannot afford to lose a newspaper with the
Observer's distinctive voice and history.'
The Independent on Sunday yesterday made no mention of the subject. Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, may face pressure to make a
Commons statement today on the Observer's future. Mr David Winnick, Labour
MP for Walsall North, called on Mr Heseltine to make a statement.
The Observer's annual losses are running at about Pounds 8m, compared with a
Pounds 14.9m deficit last year. When Mr Bock, Lonrho's biggest shareholder
with 18.8 per cent, took his seat on the board in February he set up a team
to work on the newspaper's sale.
The Observer is printed by the Financial Times under a contract which runs
to January 1995.

FT  26 APR 93 / Sickness benefits targeted in search for cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STATE-FUNDED sick pay and industrial disablement benefit have emerged as
front-line targets of the government's review of social security spending
after a Treasury demand that the review deliver immediate as well as
long-term cuts in public spending. Reductions in the two benefits would
significantly increase costs for employers.
The sharp squeeze on Whitehall budgets imposed by the government's Pounds
1bn-a-week borrowing requirement also threatens the prospect of legislation
next year to curb eligibility for invalidity benefit and to shorten the
period for which the jobless are entitled to receive unemployment benefit.
After a weekend conclave of social security ministers to discuss the future
of the welfare state, Whitehall officials will today begin drawing up two
separate strategies to cap the inexorable rise in the department's Pounds
80bn budget.
They will examine in detail the prospect for a radical overhaul of the
contributory benefits system, including steps to encourage the better-off to
'contract out' of unemployment benefit and the state pension.
Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, believes that in the long
term, private pension provision and unemployment insurance could replace the
state schemes for many of those in work.
But the potentially explosive political backlash against such inroads into
the core of the welfare state is likely to postpone any firm decisions
beyond the election due by 1997. The government has indicated that during
this parliament it will not break its manifesto commitments to universal
state pension and child benefit payments.
So the Treasury is insisting that Mr Lilley deliver a second set of options
for savings which could be implemented next year. The social security
department's traditional defence against deep cuts - that they involve
politically controversial legislation - has been dismissed in advance by
Treasury ministers.
Ministers believe that the Pounds 1.1bn annual cost of statutory sick pay
and sickness benefit is a prime target because the responsibility could be
shifted to employers. Industrial disablement benefit - which will cost the
government nearly Pounds 600m this year - is also regarded as an area where
employers rather than the state should provide insurance.
Mr Lilley, who has been told by the Treasury to produce an interim report by
June, is expected also to consider a proposal to phase out statutory
maternity pay, with the Pounds 385m-a-year cost again being transferred to
employers.
Suggestions circulating on capping the cost of invalidity benefit include
introducing a cut-off point for the benefit at age 65 and tightening up the
medical criteria for eligibility. The time limit for unemployment benefit
might be reduced from 12 months to six months.
Mr Brian Prime, a former chairman of the National Federation of
Self-employed and Small Businesses, said yesterday that any move to cut
statutory sick pay benefits or require employers to pay such benefits would
be counterproductive.
He added: 'At a time when the recession has hit small businesses very hard,
I would have thought this was the last thing the government would have
wanted to do.'

FT  26 APR 93 / Ministers accused of wrecking drugs bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS have been accused of colluding with the pharmaceutical industry
and reneging on commitments to open government by refusing to support a
Labour MP's bill that would allow for more published information on drugs.
The Medicines Information Bill proposed by Mr Giles Radice, Labour MP for
Durham North, is expected to collapse under opposition from Tory MPs and the
government when it is debated by the Commons on Friday.
Mr Radice said: 'If at the end of the day the government opposes this bill,
it will have destroyed the credibility of the prime minister's
open-government policy.'
His bill seeks to relax provisions in the 1968 Medicines Act on the release
of information so that they restrict the publication only of genuine trade
secrets. He also wants to create rights to information on drug safety.
The government is sympathetic to the principle of the bill. But Mr Tom
Sackville, junior health minister, is expected during Friday's third reading
and report stage to argue that UK drug companies would be put at a
competitive disadvantage and jobs would be threatened.
Some backbench Tory MPs have also expressed concern. Mr James Couchman, MP
for Gillingham, tried to introduce amendments during the bill's committee
stage that could have wrecked the bill. Mr Couchman declared an interest as
an adviser to Pfizer, the pharmaceutical group.
Mr Radice has dropped some clauses from the bill following pressure from the
industry and has promised to make more amendments.
But his bill is unlikely to survive in anything other than a truncated form.

FT  26 APR 93 / Parliament 'subverted' in coal row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHAIRMAN of the Commons trade and industry committee has accused the
government of subverting the authority of parliament in its handling of the
coal crisis.
Labour MP Mr Richard Caborn made the charge because of the way MPs were
denied the opportunity to vote on his committee's report on the crisis. The
government's coal white paper, published last month, largely passed over the
select committee's detailed recommendations.
Mr Caborn's charge is contained in a letter to Mr Terence Higgins, chairman
of the Commons liaison committee, which oversees the select committee
system. He says that, by ensuring the only way MPs could have voted on the
report was on an opposition motion, the government 'undermined the
credibility and independence of the select committee system'.
He calls for reform, saying 'a more rational and transparent means of
dealing with such matters' is needed.

FT  26 APR 93 / Portillo sees modest but firm recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is heading for an economic recovery which will be modest compared
with that of the 1980s but should be better sustained, Mr Michael Portillo,
chief secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday.
Provisional first-quarter figures for gross domestic product to be published
today are generally expected to signal a formal end to the recession.
Mr Portillo said it was likely that rates of growth 'even a few years out'
would not be as fast as in the 1980s, but that they would be 'better
sustained, for a longer period of time and with greater certainty'.
He said recent data on industrial production, retail sales, exports and from
the housing market were 'very encouraging' while, contrary to expectations,
there had been falls in unemployment.
The government was confident that it would meet its goal of holding
underlying inflation in the 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range this year
and next.
Mr Portillo, in an interview on BBC Radio's World this Weekend programme,
promised the government would adjust its policies to keep inflation under
control. Although 'there was no immediate prospect' of the UK rejoining the
European exchange rate mechanism, the government would take account of the
sterling exchange rate in pursuing its goal of low inflation.
Mr Portillo rejected suggestions that Britain's manufacturing industry had
been so weakened by the recession that the country faced another cycle of
stop-go.
'I don't know that this recovery is going to be like other recoveries,' he
said. He pointed out that UK manufacturing productivity and exports had
never been higher. Because industry had kept control of wages, unit wage
costs were falling, giving the British economy a lasting efficiency and
competitive gain that was 'over and above' that conferred by the fall in the
value of sterling since last September.
Falling unit wage costs might already have contributed to surprise falls in
unemployment in February and March. He urged managers, trade unions and
opposition parties to support further wage restraint to ensure the recovery
produced increased employment faster than before.
Mr Portillo also sounded an optimistic note about UK export prospects in
spite of the worsening economic condition of Britain's main European
markets. People were still buying goods in markets that were less buoyant,
while UK exporters were also active in markets outside Europe, he said.
The government has passed a turning point in its fortunes, Sir Norman
Fowler, the Conservative Party chairman, said yesterday.
'The fact of the matter is that the recovery has been taking place over the
last 12 months, but it has now speeded up,' he said on the BBC TV Breakfast
with Frost programme.
But Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, said: 'Over the next two
weeks, Sir Norman is going to try and con people into believing that all the
economic problems of this country have blown away.'
He said people could not trust the Tories' word or judgment.

UNEMPLOYMENT is set to rise by another 210,000 and will peak at around 3.15m

Interest rates may also be cut by half a percentage point to 5.5 per cent in

perhaps 7 per cent by next summer, said Mr David Kern, the bank's chief
economist.
In spite of the fall over the past two months, unemployment will continue to

FT  26 APR 93 / Insider dealing change backed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR is to support the campaign for changes to the government's Criminal
Justice Bill to ensure that the offence of insider dealing is not defined
too broadly.
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's City spokesman, said: 'I have yet to be
persuaded it will do anyone any good to create a large class of potential
insiders who are doing no more than commentating on and analysing a
company's likely results.'
The bill, designed to implement a European Community insider-dealing
directive, would, as drafted, make it an offence not only to deal on the
basis of inside information but also to take advantage of such information
by disclosing it or by encouraging others to trade.
This has prompted concern in the City that analysts and brokers could fall
foul of the law in the course of their normal day-to-day activities.
The bill recently received its second Commons reading. A committee of MPs
who will carry out the bill's line-by-line committee stage scrutiny is due
to be chosen this week.
Labour will link the issue to its drive to encourage companies to disclose
information more readily. It argues that the proposed legislation could
create a 'black market' in information and lead to more criminal activity,
rather than less.
'The best weapon against insider dealing is openness,' said Mr Darling. 'The
brokers' lunch ought to be a thing of the past.'
Mr Darling will also use the committee stage to make clear that Labour will
demand an overhaul of the Financial Services Act as its price for backing
the establishment of a professional regulatory body to deal with misconduct
falling short of insider trading under the civil code.

15 sectoral units set up a year ago to build a constructive partnership
between industry and government. Ten of the 19 people in the vehicles
division have on-line experience, with companies such as Honda, Nissan and
Unipart.
Their 'hands-on' experience represents the sharp end of Mr Heseltine's move
to win back for his department the respect of industry - the basis of his
ambitions to create a new partnership between the state and business.
The 15 divisions cover most of UK manufacturing and much of the service
sector - from vehicles, air, chemicals and steel to electronics, offshore
supplies, textiles and retailing to all the energy markets.
With the unmourned demise of the National Economic Development Office and
its own sector working groups, the intention is to use the DTI divisions as
a conduit between DTI and industry and as a source of quality market
intelligence to assist competitiveness at home and overseas. There will also
be plenty of emphasis on so-called benchmarking - continually comparing
company and industry performance against best practice and recommending ways
of improvement.
The ambition, according to a senior official with responsibility for some of
the industry divisions, is to make them so informed and knowledgeable that
the private sector will value their contribution. 'There has to be some
added value on our part. We cannot just parrot the views put to us by the
usual range of petitioners.'
He adds: 'When the managing director of a division of a major company feels
it is worthwhile to spend some time talking with someone in his sponsored
division we will be getting somewhere.'
The sectoral divisions are also expected to provide an important channel for
feeding industry's case into other parts of central government, offering
advice on the potential impact on business of other departmental proposals.
So far, so easy. The new regime will need time before it can be fairly
judged but the DTI acknowledges it still has much to do to earn its spurs
and to overturn the image of unhelpful, uninformed civil servants whose own
productivity is measured in vacuous conversations.

FT  26 APR 93 / Business leaders welcome package
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS leaders not easily impressed by political rhetoric said they were
encouraged by Mr Heseltine's message, although significant doubts remain
over his ability to deliver.
Shortly before the trade secretary made his presentation to the FT, four
business organisations were invited to DTI headquarters in London to hear
the same message.
Mr Neil Johnson, director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation,
said he hoped the unique overture offered 'a clear punctuation mark' in Mr
Heseltine's tenure at the DTI - the early stages of which had been hijacked
by the coal crisis.
Mr Johnson said: 'There is no better industry champion in cabinet than
Michael Heseltine. He is showing signs of warming to the task and we should
encourage him. He must be demanding of his officials and they must be
demanding of us.'
A more cautious note was introduced by Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of
the Institute of Directors, who welcomed Mr Heseltine's efforts to create a
'department for the market' but stressed that some of the preconditions he
had spelled out for long-term economic strength were well outside the
minister's remit.
'What he is trying to do is useful but, although he sees the total picture,
he can only influence part of it. We will have to see how successful he is
in getting other departments to join in.'
Mr Christopher Stewart-Smith, president of the British Chambers of Commerce
commented: 'We greatly welcome the constructive approach. Business
definitely feels that an important change in attitudes is under way.
'We have been understandably sceptical, given the history of the DTI, but
there is a real sense of partnership beginning to develop. As the economy
recovers, it is very encouraging to see a change in attitudes within
government, which will also help improve confidence.'
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said Mr Heseltine and the DTI were 'clearly moving in the right direction,
albeit rather slowly. The DTI has been more active in advancing industry's
interests in Whitehall, which is good.'

FT  26 APR 93 / Where the main thrust of the DTI's new competitive policy
will be focused ...: Exports
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PROOF that the DTI's new compet-itiveness strategy is working will lie in a
lasting improvement in Britain's unhealthy balance of trade.
Boosting exports - with the help of the DTI - lies at the centre of any
strategy to achieve long-term economic recovery.
The department's responsibilities for encouraging exports - Britain already
sells abroad 25 per cent of what it produces - is consequently being given
high priority under Mr Richard Needham, trade minister.
There has been a spate of recent initiatives aimed at assisting an
export-led revival, including a boost to export insurance cover, lower
insurance premiums, DTI-led export campaigns and the reorganisation of the
department's Overseas Projects Board, whose remit it is to support the fight
for big export projects.
Two years ago a partnership was also forged between the DTI and the Foreign
Office, intended to improve exporting back-up around the world. According to
one DTI official: 'The FO no longer sees trade as second-rate.'
Although details remain under wraps, Mr Heseltine is also in the process of
finalising a internal restructuring of the DTI's export support operations,
which now cost the taxpayer Pounds 170m a year - excluding the bill for
trade aid. He says his plans will extend to much more than 'moving chairs'
and will further sharpen up exporting services.
In the meantime, the private sector is being called upon to play its part in
the shape of so-called export promoters, drawn on secondment from companies
and brought in to give the benefit of their experience to others.
Mr Heseltine dismisses the concept of office-bound civil servants imploring
companies to 'get off your bottoms and go out there'. The answer, he says,
is to recruit people who have spent their careers selling overseas and who
can teach others how to do it.
About 25 full-time promoters have so far been enlisted, initially for one
year, and the intention is to get about 100 into the DTI. The department
traditionally recruits around one quarter of that number.
Freed from day-to-day line management responsibilities the promoters will
liaise with overseas posts and also maintain a dialogue with UK companies.
They will be expected to visit businesses around the country, keeping them
informed on exporting opportunities and providing advice on how to exploit
them.

FT  26 APR 93 / Heseltine's plan 'to help Britain win':  He is committed to
revitalising the relationship between the government and industry. A year
ago the trade and industry secretary promised a new industrial strategy.
After being sidetracked by the pit closure debate, this blueprint is largely
completed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, trade and industry secretary, is in search of respect.
He runs a department used to being sidelined by its political masters and
sneered at by the industries it is supposed to sponsor.
Last week, flanked by his six department ministers and his most senior civil
servants, he gave the Financial Times a detailed insight into the proposals
he is now putting into force 'to help British companies win'.
He believes the Department of Trade and Industry and its 12,450 staff have a
critical role in building a beefy British economy. But he knows the DTI's
reputation is ragged and that low morale has led many bright minds to
defect.
His task, overshadowed while the government dug itself out of the
pit-closure crisis, is to establish the DTI's authority in government and
industry; to place it at the hub of a national effort to make Britain fully
competitive in a cut-throat world.
His message to the FT was a mix of realism and enthusiasm, delivered with a
distinct Heseltine flourish, in spite of his insistence that it had not been
polished up, party conference-style, for his audience.
He stressed that his plans are long-term. They will have to be, given the
inertia to overcome, the damage to be undone and the findings of an
unpublished DTI report which says Britain's product base is weak and still
deteriorating. It, like Mr Heseltine, talks in terms of decades of
reconstruction. He dismisses gimmicks and magic solutions and talks only of
a mutual partnership with the wealth-creating sector, not of intervening at
every meal time.
His partnership, however, will not be based on cosy conversations with 'the
self-selecting elite' of big business but will embrace as many as possible
of Britain's 3m companies.
Hence his plans for a national chain of 'one-stop' advice shops for
businesses, derided by critics as another, inconsequential player in the
bewildering complex of agencies and outlets the government likes to set up.
But to Mr Heseltine, his shops are 'an idea whose time has come', a small
but important vanguard in what he says is the march towards a cultural
revolution in business and government.
Manufacturing companies have to innovate, market, get off their behinds and
go for it; government has to act as a catalyst for elements of national
self-interest and to think more carefully before it legislates in a way
which could harm business. He wants to be industry's 'friend at court'.
A man with his fair share of political enemies - but who retains a powerful
pull in cabinet and the trust of the prime minister - he does not want to
enlist any more. His evangelising will be polite but pervasive, in
Westminster and Europe. 'We will not adopt a confrontational role. That is
the way to lose influence, to close doors.'
He is certainly 'not prepared to have a punch-up with the Treasury, although
that does not mean they win all the time'. He adds: 'You are not going to
hear from me when I win. No doubt you will hear from them when I don't'
Mr Heseltine once spoke of investing in the DTI powers to rival those of the
Treasury, which dispenses to him a tiny annual budget - little more than
Pounds 1bn against Pounds 65bn for social security. It is not planning to
give him any more.
No problem. 'We do not seek to put large sums of money on the table in order
to buy an objective.' Government's role must be limited, he emphasises.
While it can climb on board to help promote industrial success, free
enterprise is in the driving seat.
Government should certainly provide some of the critical ingredients, like
sound macro-economic management, high-quality education and good transport
infrastructure. None of these is his direct responsibility and all are
subject to harsh criticism.
His underlying theme, the formula for success, is competitiveness, between
companies and between countries. Britain, in spite of some progress in the
1980s, lies 18th in the 24-nation OECD league of competitiveness. Though Mr
Heseltine admits people cannot agree on a definition, competitiveness now
represents - if such concepts are permitted - his government's industrial
policy. With it, he says, will come a critical leg-up for a national
exporting effort which is impressive but nowhere near impressive enough.
Selling overseas is to be a prime focus for the DTI, with the department's
exporting operations about to undergo a fundamental restructuring. Mr
Heseltine is happy to resurrect old, corporatist language to talk of
'national champions', though strictly in the context of export drives. 'I
would be prepared to decide what is more likely to win in the circumstances
and will put all our resources behind it. If I can help to fight on one
front then I will.'
But the first task, he says, is to establish industry's strengths and
weaknesses. On his arrival a year ago, he told his officials to get on
aircraft and 'case the world', firstly to see what the competition is up to
and then to assess, with British industry, the strategic, longer-term issues
it faces.
'Information is critical. Because on the quality of the information we
gather, the respect of industry depends. If we are known to understand, to
be aware, to have views that are coherent, thought through, well-informed,
then industry will take this department seriously'.
At the heart of his mission to understand and his plans for partnership are
the 15 sectoral divisions set up last July to shadow large chunks of British
industry. Though he once also wanted a revitalised National Economic
Development Organisation, which ran its own sector working groups, he denies
its closure was a personal defeat. He says he supported Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, in killing it off.
'My department is now doing what Nedo should have been doing on a scale
beyond the wildest dreams of Nedo's architects'. It was always kept at the
margins of government, he stresses, while his sector operations will be at
the heart of it.
Under Mr Heseltine's plan, his own department will, for example, have to be
fully abreast of state-of-the-art aerospace technology. 'We are constantly
being asked for project launch aid and I would expect people here advising
ministers to be experts in leading edge technology, knowing where its going
to be in 10 years time'.
As you spend money on frontier-type research, he says, it is vital you ask
questions as you go. 'Should you just be reactive to one scheme someone puts
up or should you have a view about where it's taking you?' Ask some
applicants about the spin-off from their activities to other sectors of the
economy and they have no idea, he shrugs.
But though Mr Heseltine has some officials on board capable of such
dialogue, he is going outside to find personnel with 'street cred'. There
are now more than 50 private-sector secondees in the DTI and more will
follow. The plan is to recruit 100 exporting experts alone.
His plans, though presented in modest, worldly-wise tones, are ambitious and
his efforts could sink in the sea of good intentions surrounding Britain's
industrial decline.
He is not prime minister, able to orchestrate from the centre, though the
prime minister on Friday publicly backed him to the hilt.
Mr Heseltine claims there has already been a sea-change in government
language and that it is seeping through the government machinery, though
there are ministers happy enough to frustrate him. Industrialists cannot
deny that much of what they have recently sought has been granted. He
expects and relishes a hard slog. 'I cannot do it faster, unless I want to
do it in a dirigiste, proscriptive way. That's disaster.
How on earth, the eighth secretary of state for trade and industry in 10
years is asked, are you going to sell this cultural change? 'I'm going to
stay here,' he chuckles.

FT  26 APR 93 / Where the main thrust of the DTI's new competitive policy
will be focused ...: Competitiveness
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH the DTI's 12,450 staff committed to 'championing competitiveness' - the
best available definition of the government's present industrial policy -
the competitiveness division inevitably lies at the core of the department's
activities.
The establishment last July of the division was among Mr Heseltine's first
initiatives on arrival at the department. Mr Bob Dobbie, an under-secretary,
was put in charge and instructed, along with his colleagues, to 'travel the
world' to size up the competition and assess Britain's weaknesses and
strengths.
Mr Dobbie and his team start with the knowledge that, in spite of some
useful improvements in productivity during the 1980s, Britain stands 18th in
a competitiveness league table of OECD countries. Mr Heseltine says the
government has a legitimate role, albeit a limited one, in improving the
UK's position.
At present, the division has a team in the Far East, while another group has
just returned from Australia, Singapore and New Zealand. Responsibilities of
the division - which currently has secondees from KPMG Peat Marwick and
Ernst &amp; Young - include an international appraisal of competitiveness among
major trading nations. Policies which effect competitive performance,
ranging from education and training through to competition policy and inward
investment, are put under the microscope. The intention is to add
first-hand, quality information to the more usual data bases.
The division, apart from being charged with spreading the competitive
message within the DTI itself, is also keen to nurture its own contacts with
companies and representative organisations.
But it also has a more difficult task - that of trying to cajole and
persuade other departments to follow the same banner.
While Mr Heseltine pledges to battle away behind closed doors - in cabinet
and cabinet committees - to ensure industry's case is heard, the division is
expected to mirror his efforts at less exalted levels, trying to prevent
other departments inflicting the competitive 'own goals' of which industry
regularly complains.
Though such intervention may not always prove popular, a senior official of
the division claims a more constructive phase of inter-departmental dialogue
is under way. The DTI, he adds, is also learning. There has been a 'decided
shift of emphasis' towards a better understanding of what other departments
are trying to achieve.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
a 'one-stop shop' for companies of all types and sizes requiring information
and advice on every aspect of running a business in a cut-throat,
competitive world.
Last July's announcement that the DTI intended to create a nationwide chain
of centres representing 'a revolution in the delivery of business services'
has been widely dismissed by sceptics as a gimmick.
Many remain unconvinced that the initiative will provide any real benefit
for business. The DTI, however, puts the plan close to the centre of its
efforts to help industry help itself. To back its words, it is putting in
Pounds 5.5m over the next three years.
There were 57 applications from partnerships - invariably involving local
chambers, training and enterprise councils, enterprise agencies and business
organisations - which competed for government cash to help operate the
centres. Some of those which failed plan to have another go.
Six initial winners have been given the go-ahead to open 23 units - dubbed
'marriage bureaux' by Baroness Denton, the minister for small businesses -
in Manchester, Birmingham, Cheshire, Tyneside and Hertfordshire. The first
should be opening in July.
The DTI hopes that around 50 shops will be operating by the end of the year
and up to 200 are planned.
The units will normally be open from early morning until well into the
evening. Some services will be free but others will be charged for. The
shops will be open to businesses of all sizes.
Customers will be able to seek advice on a range of issues, from market
intelligence and exporting to training and guidance on available finance,
possibly including locally available private funds.
Small companies might be able to plug into video-conference facilities and
will have access to databanks normally beyond their resources.
The emphasis will be on networking, designed to make life easier for
business executives who feels they operate in a lonely world.
Mr Heseltine claims that the 'one-stop shops' will replace the present
bewildering range of business support services - 'the vast majority of which
companies have no idea actually exist'.

FT  26 APR 93 / Where the main thrust of the DTI's new competitive policy
will be focused ...: Innovation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DTI started taking seriously the subject of innovation about two years
ago under Mr Peter Lilley, when the department realised that boardrooms were
not showing the same enthusiasm for the subject as their technical
departments.
'We were putting too much money into funding research and development and
not enough into making people value it,' says one DTI official.
Earlier this year the department released the findings of an investigation,
conducted jointly with the Confederation of British Industry, which showed
only one in 10 UK companies could claim to be truly innovative.
Innovation is going to be a buzz word in the 1990s and the DTI, which
acknowledges that many people still do not know what it means, is at pains
to stress that it is not only for backroom boffins. Neither does it have to
cost money.
In Mr Heseltine's words, innovation is not necessarily about the sharp end
of high technology. 'Small, low-tech companies can innovate simply by
finding a way of doing something a bit better than they did it before. It is
a process of constantly seeking to improve performance.'
On his arrival at the DTI, he told his innovation team, headed by Mr
Geoffrey Robinson - brought in from IBM to be chief adviser on science and
technology - that he was minded to abolish the unit. Having taken their
breath away, he explained he merely wanted the entire department to assist
in promoting the innovation message, both within the DTI itself and
externally.
Mr Heseltine again decided to recruit outsiders with 'street cred' to help
with the job by talking to businesses and organising conference and local
working groups to stimulate best practice in innovation. Networking systems
designed to promote local technology transfer are also being encouraged.
The unit now has five industry secondees dedicated to spreading the
innovation message throughout the sectors sponsored by the DTI. Plans
involve the eventual recruitment of up to 30 secondees to establish a
national, innovation network involving companies of all sizes, educational
establishments and sources of finance.
But Mr Heseltine has to tread carefully. Mr William Waldegrave, minister for
public service and science, is responsible for science and technology policy
and is about to unveil white paper proposals for giving it a higher profile.

FT  26 APR 93 / Where the main thrust of the DTI's new competitive policy
will be focused ...: Deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DTI's deregulation unit operates under the watchful eye of the prime
minister. Mr John Major says he hates red tape and, in memorable scenes
during last year's Tory party conference, urged Mr Heseltine to don his
jungle garb and get rid of it.
Day-to-day responsibility has been handed down to Mr Neil Hamilton, consumer
affairs minister, but Mr Major demands a progress report every eight weeks.
In July he will convene the second Downing Street meeting this year to see
if the 'burden on business' is being gradually lifted.
But the war on unwanted paper work - carried forward by a deregulation
minister in each department - draws only cynical sneers from critics who
dismiss it as a cheap bid for headlines.
Business, particularly small business, thinks differently, though it remains
to be convinced that the government will not simply print two new
regulations for every one it scraps. As Mr Heseltine put it: 'Ministers
quite like regulations. They are the frame on which political success is
often measured.'
The latest hunt has yielded 3,500 regulations which are deemed to impinge
directly on UK business, all of which have now been entered in the DTI's
'Domesday Book' for early examination.
Last month, the department appointed heads to seven 'task forces' of
business people, who will spearhead an attack on unnecessary regulations
across a broad spectrum of industry, ranging from engineering and
construction to transport, pharmaceuticals and financial services.
Lord Sainsbury presides over the seven teams, who have six months to do
their work and report back. 'It's a blitz, rather than a marathon,' says one
DTI official who is involved. The job is not simply one of dismantling
obstacles in the way of business - which will not necessarily be easy, given
the likely need in some cases for primary legislation. Some regulations will
be retained but simplified.
The government has since February also insisted that no new regulations can
be imposed on UK companies unless the cost to them is spelled out before
being put to parliament. Red tape emanating from the European community is
also under scrutiny, with 500 small businesses being surveyed to find what
they think about the regulations they are expected to obey. Mr Hamilton says
he has gone to great lengths to ensure the survey itself will not be a
burden.

FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Business almost usual at EBRD - Peter
Norman, who was at a seminar in the bank when the bomb exploded, says staff
hardly flinched as the building trembled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BRIEF flickering of lights on the fifth floor of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development gave the first hint of an explosion.
A moment later, at about 10.25am on Saturday, the 12-storey steel and
concrete structure lifted and trembled as the blast, a few hundred yards to
the south along Bishopsgate, rolled and roared around Liverpool Street
station and the Broadgate office complex for what seemed several seconds.
While the EBRD has achieved notoriety for the un-British opulence of its
headquarters, it reacted on Saturday with a very British stiff upper lip,
business-as-usual approach to the IRA bomb.
While most of the City was enjoying a day off, the bank was almost as busy
as on a normal day. About 1,000 businessmen, bankers, journalists and
officials were in the EBRD headquarters for a day of seminars and
round-table discussions ahead of the formal opening today of the bank's
annual meeting.
In the fifth-floor room where I was, Mr Mario Sarcinelli, the vice-president
responsible for development banking, gamely continued a press briefing on
fiscal problems in eastern Europe.
As wire service reporters rushed from the room, Mr Sarcinelli brushed aside
a recorded announcement of a fire in the building as 'something that always
happens'. He doggedly kept up his expose of east Europe's need for tax
reforms as announcements urged all to stay at their work stations and away
from windows.
The voice in the loudspeaker need not have worried. The bank and its
celebrated marble fittings survived virtually unscathed. Although the
building had heaved, breaking a few windows in a ground-floor wine bar,
there was a notable absence of panic. 'We put the blinds down and carried
on,' an official explained.
The emergency may have gone some way to fostering camaraderie among
delegates and easing tensions created by recent disclosures of the bank's
alleged high spending.
Yesterday the Dunkirk spirit was again on show as bands of hob-nobbing and
networking delegates wove around cordoned-off streets on their way to the
EBRD headquarters at One Exchange Square.
For some veteran staffers, it was a matter of deja vu. Last year's big April
bomb had gone off much closer to the previous EBRD headquarters and caused
far more damage to the bank's building.

FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: IRA exploited reduction in spot security
checks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE second significant IRA bomb attack in the heart of the City in just over
a year has served as a chilling reminder of the terrorist organisation's
capacity to strike and strike again, and the security forces' apparent
inability to stop it.
According to Mr John Wyatt, a bomb disposal expert and security adviser, the
type of bomb proved the extent of the IRA's logistical and organisational
capacity.
Unlike Semtex, which can be lethal even in small quantities, the ammonium
nitrate fertiliser used in the City bomb needs to be gathered in
considerable quantities, mixed with other base materials, and then packed
into several containers.
The process by which this material was gathered, stored, assembled, and then
transported to the City seems at no point to have been detected by the
security forces.
According to security sources, the IRA appears to have exploited a reduction
in the frequency of armed spot checks on traffic by the City of London
police.
The security forces are understood to have been assuming the next big
terrorist attack would be directed at a political figure rather than
property.
Professor Paul Wilkinson, an expert on terrorism, estimated yesterday that
there were probably now as many as 40 people actively engaged in IRA
terrorism on the mainland.
In a comment echoed by some MPs, Prof Wilkinson described present
arrangements for dealing with the IRA as a 'recipe for fragmentation' and
urged the creation of a 'single body' to co-ordinate resources and
intelligence.
Since last year MI5 has in theory been in overall charge of intelligence
gathering, with the Metropolitan Police's anti-terrorist squad giving it
logistical support. But in practice the mainland anti-terrorist drive has
continued to involve any of Britain's 54 regional constabularies, as well as
forces on both sides of the Irish border.
The intelligence record in fighting against the IRA remains in deficit, with
bomb attacks far outnumbering arrests, let alone convictions.
'Short of turning each building in the City into a concrete bunker at huge
cost there is no guarantee this won't happen again,' said Mr Wyatt.
But he believes companies can make themselves, if not totally secure, at
least less vulnerable by using a strategy based on:
Restricted access of large vehicles to specific times which can be monitored
by the companies concerned and the police.
The use of mobile screens of laminated fibre glass mat which can quickly
cover an office's window in an emergency and reduce injuries from shattering
glass.
The location of computers and other expensive equipment well away from
street-facing areas of an office.
Mr Owen Kelly, City of London police commissioner, called yesterday for
extended powers to tackle the terrorist threat. He said he wanted the power
to set up road checks 'wherever and whenever, without specific reason for
doing so'.
In the meantime, the IRA will consider the weekend events as a significant
coup, consistent with the terrorist organisation's own policy of forcing
Northern Ireland on to the English and international political agenda.

FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Historic church reduced to rubble after
600 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHURCH that was built before the Great Fire of London, which survived
the Victorian building boom, the Blitz and the plate-glass revolution of the
1980s, has been reduced to rubble.
There was, however, an ironic if small silver lining to its fate - some of
its treasures were moved to St Paul's Cathedral last year after it suffered
damage in the Baltic Exchange bomb. Valuables, including a painting from the
Bruegel school, escaped the weekend bombing.
St Ethelburga the Virgin on Bishopsgate, parts of which date back to 1400,
was the smallest and one of the oldest churches in the City. Only 30 feet
wide and 60 feet long, it was tucked between the two office blocks which
bore the brunt of Saturday's explosion.
Its larger sister church and the accompanying rectory were badly scarred by
last April's bomb, which wrecked the home of the the Rev Dick Lucas, rector
for 30 years.
Repair work to bomb damage at St Ethelburga's was just about to begin before
Saturday's blast. The church was enjoying a fragile revival after being
closed down some years ago. It had been re-dedicated as a Chapel of Ease in
March 1992 and after some refurbishment was open for a few days before
suffering Pounds 75,000 worth of damage in April.
Hopes of a renaissance for the church were shattered on Saturday when Mr
Paul Sutherland, the parish clerk and the building's official keyholder, was
called to the Guildhall by police. The church was at the centre of the
central danger zone which is expected to be closed for at least four days.
But reports suggested that nothing remained except for one wall. 'Its just a
crater and a pile of rubble,' said Mr Sutherland.
The parish is now reduced to two churches but yesterday parish administrator
Ms Elizabeth Ellingworth said: 'We are still holding services at St Peter's
in Cornhill . . . in spite of the hardship we are determined not to be
beaten.'

FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Lord Mayor in the spotlight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'EXCUSE ME for a minute,' said Sir Francis McWilliams, the Lord Mayor of
London, breaking off our interview yesterday. 'The Japanese Ambassador is on
the phone.'
It was just one among several dozen calls that he had received, at his
office in Ironmonger Lane in the City, which became the centre of operations
to help prepare for business again today.
'The Japanese banks are a very important market for us,' said Mr Michael
Cassidy, chairman of the City corporation's policy committee, during the
pause. 'We do need to reassure them that we are doing everything we can.'
Mr John Major, the prime minister, had called to offer condolences and
promise a meeting early next week. Sir Francis had spoken to the US
ambassador and put in a call to the Saudi ambassador.
By mid-afternoon he had also talked to 'the major ratepayers' and others
affected by the bombing or involved in attempting to restore normality,
including the heads of the Stock Exchange, Lloyd's, Mitsubishi, Barclays,
NatWest, British Rail, London Transport and British Telecom.
'I was bloody angry,' said Sir Francis. 'It's so pointless. It's not going
to change anything or improve things in Belfast. But everybody is coping
remarkably well.'
The ancient wood-panelled rooms, ornament-covered mahogany desks and
servants in maroon tailcoats carrying bringing tea in silver pots stood in
stark contrast to the urgency of the day.
A constant stream of officials from the Corporation of the City of London
passed through the office for strategic meetings to help co-ordinate
reaction to the blast.
The Commissioner of the City of London police and other uniformed senior
officers rushed through at lunchtime. A few minutes later came the City
engineer, with helmet and luminous hazard-jacket, nervously pulling out a
comb to smarten his hair before ascending to the Mayor's office on the first
floor.
A few hundred yards away, the Corporation of London's headquarters at
Guildhall had been besieged since 5am with keyholders wanting passes to
allow them and their contractors into the cordoned-off area so that they
could assess the damage to their buildings.
The central area of damage remained sealed off even to contractors as police
forensic experts examined the site of the blast, and engineers inspected
buildings for safety.
The City was not slow to capitalise on yesterday's recovery action. It said
its swift response showed the effectiveness of the Corporation government,
while the action by St Bartholomew's hospital in dealing with casualties
added fresh weight to the case against closure.

FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Glut of offices remains despite damage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE second time in little more than a year the City has reluctantly
begun the gruesome calculations of how an IRA bomb will affect the City's
oversupply of office space.
Chartered surveyors, agents and property companies were yesterday keenly
aware that the City's reputation and attractiveness as an international
financial centre has been severely damaged. Already one firm, Wates City,
had set up shop within the heart of the Corporation of London to place
tenants in vacant properties.
But just as the shock waves of the Bishopsgate bombing may have spread
further this time, so the short term benefit to the property market may be
greater than when the IRA bombed St Mary Axe in April last year.
The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors estimated yesterday - without the
benefit of a tour of the most badly affected area - that tenants occupying
1.1m square feet of office space have been badly affected by the bomb.
By comparison, the St Mary Axe bomb led to 300,000 sq ft of additional
property being let after two buildings bore the brunt of the attack,
according to the property surveyors, Jones Lang Wootton.
Mr George Grillon, chairman of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors,
said yesterday that it was far too early to say how much of the damaged
space would be back in service after easy and quick re-glazing efforts by
the thousands of glaziers already swarming through the City.
But any increase in demand would come against a backdrop of chronic
oversupply.
Within the boundaries of the City of London there are about 3.5m sq ft of
new and unoccupied office premises ready for use and about the same quantity
available within older buildings.
Extending the survey area marginally to include a broader definition of the
City - taking in post codes EC1 to EC4 - there are 5m sq ft of new office
space and another 7.5m in older buildings.
Additional capacity would also come out of mothballs should the property
market show any sign of firming.
Other considerations suggest the damage to the City's reputation might have
a more enduring impact than the increase in demand.
The larger affected companies - such as NatWest and HSBC - have contingency
arrangements that mainly involve squeezing into space they already occupy
elsewhere in London. Also, lessors have an obligation to return to their
original buildings once they are repaired, so any increase in demand would
be temporary.

FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Hongkong Bank bombed again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 300 of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's 600 staff in
London are expected to be at work today in different buildings, after the
bank yesterday hastily re-allocated most of the work carried out at its
Bishopsgate branch.
Hongkong Bank, a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings, said the most severe
disruption would be through the loss of paper files. Papers such as letters
of credit dating back three months were scattered and destroyed in the
blast.
The bank was yesterday allowed to send managers into its office to retrieve
computer data. It will today start re-running the data from a processing
centre in Sheffield owned by Midland Bank, another HSBC Holdings subsidiary.
The bank said most of its offices inside the Bishopsgate building
transferred their paper files to microfilm after three months, but customers
with more recent dealings could suffer disruption.
The bank had to spend Pounds 600,000, largely replacing windows, to repair
damage to the same building caused by the IRA bomb that blew up the Baltic
Exchange a year ago. However, the damage this time was far more severe.
Sir William Purves, HSBC Group chairman, said the Hongkong Bank branch in
Bishopsgate, which concentrates on trade finance and corporate banking, was
'a relatively small branch' but was still the main one for the bank in
Britain.
In Hong Kong, Sir William said: 'It is fair to say that the computer is out
and that the building is in a bad state. The water pipes were broken and
water is flowing through the building and it has no power.'
Hongkong Bank occupied eight of the 26 floors in the tower, which was opened
18 years ago. It had just moved its treasury operations to an office on
Lower Thames Street in which its trading operations are merged with Midland.
Hongkong Bank said that the main banking and trade finance operations of the
bank would be relocated to spare office space at HSBC Holdings' head office
in Lower Thames Street, and an adjacent Midland Bank data processing
building.
Its corporate finance and property services functions would be moved to an
office in Devonshire Square where it carries out asset management functions
and the fund management side of its James Capel subsidiary.
The bank's vaults on the lower ground floor are thought to have remained
intact, in spite of the collapse of some lower level floors. They hold all
valuable documents such as securities.
Hongkong Bank said it would have no clear idea of the damage to the building
and whether it could be salvaged until it was allowed back in by the
authorities, which it expected could be 'a matter of weeks rather than
days'.

FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Estimated insurance losses at 'Pounds
300m'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURED losses caused by Saturday's bomb attack are likely to exceed Pounds
300m, according to the Association of British Insurers, the industry trade
association.
The ABI said the losses would be of the same magnitude as last year's City
bombs. The pattern of payouts could also be repeated, it added. Two thirds
of claims were for material damage - to property, fixtures and fittings -
with roughly one third of payouts compensating lost profit and rental
income.
Mr Nick Balcombe, a loss assessor, said he expected losses to be more
extensive and could exceed Pounds 1bn. 'Many more buildings will have to
come down. The Hongkong bank has had its guts ripped out. I don't think
Bishopsgate will be open for some time.'
Describing these and other estimates as 'likely to prove wildly inaccurate',
the ABI said most businesses affected are likely to have 'carefully worked
out contingency plans which should minimise disruption and keep down
business interruption claims'.

FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Unease over security as frustrations build
up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASSURANCES that business would continue as usual were again much in evidence
as mopping up began yesterday after the City's second one-tonne bomb in just
over a year.
But this time the questions being asked were more pointed, the unease among
financial institutions more pronounced.
Sir William Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings, which owns Midland Bank as
well as the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, summed up the sense
of frustration. 'I am absolutely sure that the authorities are doing the
best they can. It is very difficult, I'm sure, to track down these people.
But it does seem quite extraordinary that that quantity of explosives can be
put in a truck and brought into the City.'
The shock from this second bomb could have a bigger impact in the long term
than the first. Sir William said: 'At a time when there is a fair amount of
competition for a future central bank of Europe, this must work against the
case for it being in London.'
The attack is likely to have little effect on where institutions such as
National Westminster Bank and HSBC Holding - two of those worst hit  -
choose to do business. NatWest operates at the heart of the UK financial
establishment, while HSBC only moved its head office from Hong Kong to
London at the start of this year. Through subsidiaries such as James Capel
and Midland Bank, as well as through the London branch of the Hongkong Bank,
it has one of the biggest presences of any financial institution in London.
The Corporation of London, the City's local authority, lists HSBC and
NatWest - alongside BP, the oil giant - as among its biggest ratepayers,
shouldering a large part of the Corporation's annual Pounds 700m budget.
Large institutions such as these had already pressed after last year's bomb
for a greater police presence to protect the City from terrorist attack and
are likely to become more vociferous still this time around.
The devastation could have more of an effect on institutions whose presence
in London is smaller. The number of foreign banks in London has remained
more or less constant at about 500, but many have already cut operations
sharply in the face of unprofitable banking markets in recent years. Events
such as the Bishopsgate bomb may give some the excuse they need to pack up
altogether, though this would have little impact on the City's main markets.
The City establishment was yesterday dismissing the thought that London's
competitive position was about to be undermined. Lord Alexander, chairman of
National Westminster Bank, said: 'At first glance, this is obviously bad for
the City. But it does provide the opportunity to emphasise that it is
business as usual the next morning, which is, after all, what the City
stands for. I'm confident that, whatever the pressures, the City remains
competitive.'
Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the Stock Exchange - itself the target of
terrorist bombs in the past - added: 'It's perilously easy to get
overwhelmed by the drama of events like this. Other centres have their
problems - though perhaps they haven't had two big bombs like us.'
He pointed to the terrorist bomb this year at New York's World Trade Centre
and to the assassination in the past two decades of the heads of two of
Germany's biggest banks - Alfred Herrhausen of Deutsche Bank and Jurgen
Ponto of Dresdner - as proof that other financial centres faced similar
difficulties.
The Bank of England also waded in to the debate in defence of London's
financial centre, which recorded Pounds 16.9bn of overseas earnings in 1991.
'The experience of last time doesn't suggest that this will affect the
City's ability to do business internationally or to attract business from
overseas,' the Bank said.
It conceded, though, that as far as London's competitive position was
concerned, 'obviously it doesn't help'.
Behind the assurances was an acceptance that the City would remain
vulnerable to terrorist attack and that the cost of insuring against damage
to property or the loss of earnings that results from bomb attack is likely
to rise further. Last year's bomb had already led to a doubling of the cost
of insuring large commercial buildings in the City, according to the
Corporation.
The proof that Europe's leading financial centre is vulnerable to terrorist
attack, in spite of extra security arrangements introduced after last year's
bomb outside the Baltic Exchange, has not come at a good time for the City
establishment.
Last month's move by the Stock Exchange to scrap its planned Taurus
automated settlement system, at an estimated cost of Pounds 400m, was a big
reversal for the credibility of London's securities markets - though the
computer disaster had little effect on the operations of the markets.
Foreign financial institutions often complain of London's poor transport
system or its heavy burden of regulation on the wholesale investment markets
 -though recent steps have reduced the second of these complaints. The
threat of bombing, and the probable rise in the cost of insuring against it,
could become the latest on the list of moans.
The City's future security arrangements were already the subject of
discussion yesterday. 'There's no financial centre that is free from all
risk, and we can't expect to be either,' the Bank of England said. However,
the Corporation, whose budget supports an 800-strong police force, among
other services, was working on plans yesterday to make the chance of a third
bomb more remote.
'This has got to have some impact on security arrangements,' said Sir Andrew
Hugh Smith. 'There will have to be some further tightening up.'
The Corporation has been trying to discourage private cars from entering the
City area, in part by turning side-streets into pedestrian areas. This
process will be accelerated, said Mr Michael Cassidy, head of policy,
allowing the police to put more effort into checking commercial vehicles
going into the Square Mile. There was an acceptance at the Corporation and
elsewhere, though, that the City could not be protected from all risks of
attack.
The bomb is also likely to have a direct financial impact, in the process
adding to the cost of operating in the City and making it a less attractive
centre from which to operate. Insurance costs have risen as a result of last
year's bomb, as insurance companies have moved to exclude terrorist damage
as an insurable risk and a government-backed reinsurance arrangement has
been launched.
According to most estimates of the cost of the weekend's damage, the
private-sector contribution to this insurance fund for the current year has
been more than exhausted, leaving it to the taxpayer to foot part of the
bill - and the full cost of any further damage to large commercial buildings
on the UK mainland from further terrorist attack over the coming year.
Given this, it was thought highly probable yesterday that insurance premiums
to cover the risk of terrorism will increase sharply in future years.

FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Damaged buildings may be destroyed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST one office building and a parade of shops will need to be
demolished in the wake of Saturday's blast, construction experts said
yesterday.
St Ethelburga's, one of London's oldest churches, was also destroyed in the
blast. Two other offices, the headquarters of the Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation and a building belonging to the National Bank of Abu
Dhabi, were also severely damaged.
A decision on their future will not be taken until a full structural
assessment can be made. The initial reaction of experts was that more
windows had been destroyed than in the explosion which last year badly
damaged London's Baltic Exchange, but that structural damage was less.
The streets around Bishopsgate are broader than those around the Baltic
Exchange, which allowed the effects of the blast to spread.
Among the first engineers to be called out was the dangerous structures team
run by Costain, the UK contractor. The unit is under contract to a
consortium of 12 London boroughs and has been present at virtually every
disaster in the capital during the past 20 years - including the Baltic
Exchange bomb, the Brixton riots and the Iranian embassy siege in 1981.
Its first job yesterday was to ensure that damaged buildings were made safe
for repair work to start and allow for emergency services to conduct more
detailed searches for clues.
Mr John Milcock, the team's foreman, said: 'It could be several weeks before
the full extent and cost of the damage is known.
'First impressions are that three or four buildings may have suffered
structural damage. In addition there are vast quantities of broken glass.
'The church has been wiped out and the offices next to it (Kansallis House,
occupied by the Finnish bank Kansallis-Osake Pankki) are severely damaged.
The Hongkong and Shanghai bank appears to have some of its pillars damaged.
Almost all of its windows have been destroyed.'
Mr Peter Bennett, deputy city surveyor for the City of London said: 'Most of
the damage to Hongkong and Shanghai bank was blast damage rather than
structural. All the internal walls have been blown through.'
Mr Bennett added that Kansallis House would have to be demolished as it was
in a dangerous state. The blast had shattered the concrete frame and blown
away some of the reinforcing.
The National Bank of Abu Dhabi at 90 Bishopgate, next door to Kansallis
House, was also severely damaged and might have to be pulled down, Mr
Bennett said.
He said that a parade of Victorian shops on the corner of Wormwood Street
and Bishopsgate would also have to be demolished.

FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Shattered NatWest tower unfit for use
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 600ft National West-minster tower, one of the City's landmarks, is
likely to remain empty for some time. Up to a third of the 12,000 square
metres of glass in its windows was shattered in the bomb blast.
The bank yesterday started allocating the 1,300 staff who work in the tower
to desks at other buildings in the City. It emphasised that none of its data
processing or trading functions would be affected by the blast.
Nearly all staff and managers in the tower work on its UK branch business -
about 50 work on international business - and NatWest said it did not
believe their work would be substantially disrupted by having to move
offices.
Mr Derek Wanless, the bank's chief executive, said it was still assessing
the extent of damage to the tower and surrounding buildings, including a
hall where its annual shareholders' meeting was due to be held tomorrow. The
meeting has been moved to the Whitbread Brewery Conference Centre in
Chiswell Street.
Mr Wanless said damage to the tower was 'substantially worse' than last
year, when it lost about 160 windows in the Baltic Exchange bombing. The
bank expects to be able to make an assessment of damage by the end of the
week.
He said there had been 'slight damage' to the NatWest Markets investment
banking subsidiary at 135 Bishopsgate, but trading and other operations
would continue without interruption today, and clients would not be
affected.
The bank said the tower, opened in 1981, had been 'fully insured'. It did
not expect to lose files or data as a result of the blast, and operations
such as credit cards and local branch services would be unaffected.
NatWest's staff who are not needed for work immediately will be advised to
take up to two days off work while the bank re-allocates functions. The bank
said it was establishing a telephone service to advise employees.

FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Glaziers flock to the 'bazaar'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLAZIERS were the first beneficiaries yesterday as an army of construction
workers began clearing up hundreds of tonnes of broken glass and rubble.
Some companies were called within minutes of the bomb going off. Central
Glazing was called almost immediately by Libra Litho in St Botolph Street
and Union Discount Company in Cornhill, and was at work on Saturday
afternoon.
Many glaziers turned up on spec to tout for work, pressing business cards
into the hands of anybody who would take them. One observer said: 'It is
like a bazaar down there.'
A woman answering the phone at Plate Glass yesterday said there was nobody
to take the call because all the vans were out. 'The drivers went out as
soon as they heard of the explosion on the radio. They did not wait for
customers to contact them but went out chasing work.'
The first task has been to remove broken glass and board up empty windows.
Some customers may have to wait until today before assessing the extent of
damage to their windows.
Workmen were yesterday busy removing acres of broken glass from the roof of
Liverpool Street station. British Rail estimated damage at Pounds 250,000.
Hayes Glass said it had gone out on Saturday to assist a long-standing
client, one of the Bill Bentley wine bars in the City, but had been
prevented by police from entering the area. It ended up boarding up the
seven floors of windows of a nearby bank building.
Companies such as Hayes are likely to be busy again today, and for some time
to come.

FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Contingency plans smooth the aftermath for
some
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY CITY businesses have seen carefully laid contingency plans work
smoothly, although a few were considering their future in the Square Mile.
Mr Hamid Noorizadeh , assistant general manager of Tokai Bank, a Japanese
wholesale and commercial bank, said: 'We set up a disaster contingency plan.
That is why it is working so well for us now. We have been working on this
since yesterday morning flat out.'
Tokai's headquarters, which occupied three floors in the Hongkong and
Shanghai Bank building, is moving temporarily to the offices of a subsidiary
in nearby Finsbury Square. It has about 50 dealing positions, eight of which
have moved to Safety Net Trading Places, a company which offers emergency
dealing facilities.
Mr Noorizadeh said: 'We drew up a comprehensive disaster plan back in July
1992 and it went very well. It will be business as usual from Monday
morning.'
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan also had a contingency plan and has
successfully moved to King William Street.
Banque Indosuez, part of the French group, was yesterday negotiating dealing
space at Bankers Trust, the US commercial bank.
The response of many foreign institutions is likely to calm fears that
London's status as an international financial centre could be undermined by
the bombing.
Mr Takeshi Kadota, managing director of Mitsubishi Corporation Finance,
which has moved to premises on Cheapside, said: 'Our business will not be
fully operational for at least one week because we do not like to start up
with an unsatisfactory infrastructure and uncertain market information. But
it is not our idea to move from the City.'
Others feel differently. Saudi International Bank, which has found
alternative premises, said it would consider its future location
'carefully'.
Mr Richard Wilson, chief operating officer, said: 'We were bombed out last
year. At that stage we had a contingency plan of sorts but we tightened it
up considerably following the first bomb.'
He said the bank had not yet decided whether to stay in the City. 'We will
have to wait and see. It is something we are going to have to think about
very carefully. Obviously security will be an issue.'
Few said they believed London was now more dangerous than other locations.
One executive said: 'These things happen. You could be in the World Trade
Centre in New York and a bomb could go off.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NATWEST TOWER COMPLEX
No. 15 Bishopsgate.  Sole occupier, National Westminister Bank. Structural
damage to the tower is minor.  The complex at street level has been blown
through, although the damage is mostly superficial. Work is in progress to
replace an estimated 3,000-4,000 sq metres of glass, and fittings.
No. 99 BISHOPSGATE
Main occupier is Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, but many floors
are sublet to other tenants.  The office block sustained serious damage.
The blast blew through all the walls leaving just an outer shell.  Damage
was also sustained by some of the supporting pillars. Engineers are
attempting to make the building safe but are being hampered by falling
glass.  No decision has yet been taken on whether to demolish the building.
PALMERSTON HOUSE
No. 55 Bishopsgate.  Sole occupier Long Term Credit Bank of Japan. Serious
blast damage has been sustained, but the structure remains intact.  The
fascia has been largely destroyed, along withe internal fixtures and
fittings.  Engineers are engaged in further safety checks before repair work
can start.
Nos. 38-68 BISHOPSGATE
Other offices and shops.  Despite heavy superficial damage, the structures
of the next few hundred yards of buildings remain sound. Glass and fittings
have been blown out and some internal walls have collapsed.  Repair work is
being hampered by hazardous conditions.
Nos. 20-26 WORMWOOD STREET
The Victorian parade of small retailing units bore the side impact of the
blast, which ripped out frontages and inflicted serious damage.  Demolition
is considered likely.
No. 90 BISHOPSGATE
Sole occupier is the National Bank of Abu Dhabi.  The building bore some of
the brunt of the blast, sustaining structural damage.  All the interior
walls have been blown through.  Demolition is under consideration.
Engineers are being hampered by the poor state of the neighbouring building.
KANSALLIS HOUSE
Nos. 76-86 Bishopsgate.  Party sublet.  The building took the full impact of
the explosion.  No internal walls or fittings have survived. The exterior
has been extensively destroyed and reinforced concrete supporting pillars
are dangerously exposed.  A buckled wall is said to be supporting the entire
structure.  Demolition is a neccessity. However, the bomb crater is making
building work difficult.
ST ETHELBURGA CHURCH
Smallest and one of the oldest churches in the City, it is now 'a pile of
rubble', according to one visiting engineer.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Aids memorial quilt stretches along the Mall in Washington where,
according to police, 300,000 people marched yesterday for equal rights for
homosexuals in the US. President Bill Clinton sent a message to the
gathering: 'I stand with you in the struggle for equality for all
Americans.' But he was in Boston yesterday to speak to newspaper editors.
The president's decision not to attend angered some homosexual rights
activists, who claim he has backed away from some of his electoral campaign
promises to them, but others said it was better that Mr Clinton had stayed
away in that right-wingers would have less to use against him.

FT  26 APR 93 / China's potential emerging from behind the figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA is a large country with a big economy which is getting bigger by the
year. But only now is it being understood quite how large and economically
powerful China could become early in the next century - provided, that is,
its development is not derailed by another of the bouts of inflation that
have accompanied its impressive performance.
Chinese gross national product grew by an average 9 per cent a year over the
last 13 years, far outstripping the growth rate of the population. The
authorities may be about to put the brakes on to prevent over-heating, as at
the end of the 1980s.
Growth rose last year to 12 per cent, but the year-on-year inflation rate
also accelerated to 15.7 per cent in the first quarter of this year. But
Chinese GNP in 1994 should still be four times larger than in 1978, when
market-based economic reforms began.
Yet China's economic potential has been partly obscured from view by some
strange World Bank statistics. According to the latest World Development
Report, the dollar value of Chinese output per person has been falling over
the past decade.
It has dropped from Dollars 410 in 1976 to Dollars 370 in 1990 -
one-sixtieth of US GNP per head. With China's population estimated at 1.13bn
in 1990, total measured GNP was Dollars 410bn, smaller than that of Canada,
which was Dollars 542bn, and the UK, which was Dollars 908bn.
The reason for this strange result is the steep fall in the value of the
yuan against the dollar since 1979. This has cut deeply into the dollar
value of Chinese GNP, measured at national prices. But Chinese GNP is
understated at current exchange rates because of the low prices of services
relative to those in developed countries at market exchange rates.
One measure of this distortion is the large size of the China's export
sector relative to measured GNP. The value of Chinese exports has risen from
Dollars 13.7bn in 1979 to Dollars 62bn in 1990, or 15 per cent of measured
GNP. This implies that China's export/GNP ratio is twice that of the US,
despite China's huge geographic size and relative isolation.
World Bank officials have never denied that these statistics are misleading.
In the latest issue of Global Economic Prospects for developing countries,
they have provided an alternative, more realistic measure of the potential
economic size of the Chinese economic area - which includes Hong Kong,
Singapore and Taiwan, as well as China - at the beginning of the next
millennium.
The bank believes that China can maintain economic growth rates in excess of
7 per cent over the coming decade. Using its baseline forecasts, it
estimates that CEA national output, measured at market prices, will be
larger than that of the UK, Italy and France by 2002, although still only a
quarter of US GNP.
The picture changes dramatically if GNP is measured instead by standard
international prices for both traded and non-traded goods and services. On
this basis, CEA output is already larger than that of both Germany and
Japan.
By 2002, the bank estimates that CEA's GNP will have risen to Dollars
9,800bn, marginally larger than that of the US.
Even then, GNP per head in the CEA would be lower - Dollars 7,300 compared
to Dollars 36,100 in the US, Dollars 37,900 in Japan and Dollars 39,100 in
Germany - but the gap would be much narrower than when measured at current
exchange rates.
These alternative calculations also mislead. As a measure of economic
welfare or quality of life, they make sense: people in China need haircuts
as much as those in the US, even if they cost far less in Beijing than in
New York. But China can only convert the value of these haircuts into
international goods at current exchange rates, which give little
international purchasing power to those who provide them.
As the Chinese economy develops, the domestic price of these non-traded
goods will gradually rise relative to the internationally determined prices
of traded goods. But for now, GNP measured at standardised prices, while
useful for some purposes, overstates China's presence on the world economic
stage.

Seasonally adjusted data used in all cases. Statistics for Germany
apply only to western Germany. GDP/GNP is broken down into private
consumption expenditure, investment (the sum of gross fixed capital
formation and the change in stocks), general government final
consumption, and net exports (exports of goods and services minus
imports of goods and services). The US includes investment by
government in the government series, rather than under investment.
Quarterly GDP/GNP totals are annualised. The growth rates are the
percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous year,
and are positive unless otherwise stated. The figures in the fifth
column of each set of growth rates refer only to exports, rather than
to net exports. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA from national
government sources.

FT  26 APR 93 / Funerals raise tension again: Impatience with political
talks in South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR

<TEXT>
SOUTH Africa yesterday braced for another round of potential violence at
political funerals, after the death at the weekend by natural causes of Mr
Oliver Tambo, elder statesman of the African National Congress and patron of
the liberation struggle.
He had been in failing health since a stroke in 1989 and was no longer
active in ANC policy-making, but remained a potent symbol of resistance to
apartheid. ANC officials said they believed his funeral would be as large as
that for Mr Chris Hani, whose violent death two weeks ago provoked a serious
political crisis in South Africa.
Mr Tambo, though his health kept him away from the negotiations, is credited
with helping to engineer a shift in ANC policy in 1989 - the movement opted
to negotiate rather than fight for an end to apartheid.
Within the next week, South Africa will bury two political leaders - Mr
Tambo, who is to be interred next Sunday at his old home town of Benoni,
east of Johannesburg, and Mr Andries Treurnicht of the right-wing
Conservative party, who is to be buried tomorrow at a big ceremony in
Pretoria.
On Wednesday, a mass funeral will be held, at Sebokeng township near
Johannesburg, for the 19 victims of a massacre on the eve of Mr Hani's
funeral last week. A funeral will also take place for a TV reporter of the
state-run South African Broadcasting Corporation, murdered in Sharpeville
township at the weekend.
The funerals are likely to create new tension, as multi-party negotiations
resume today for a new constitution. Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC leader, stressed
the impatience of young ANC members at the slowness of negotiations over a
political settlement in South Africa. 'Time is not on our side. A date for
elections must be set now,' he said.
ANC and government negotiators have committed themselves to push for
agreement in the multi-party negotiations within six weeks, this to include
an election date, the installation of a multi-party transitional executive
council to advise the government before multi-racial elections, an interim
constitution until elections, and principles for a future constitution.
This last would include multi-party power sharing until the end of the
century.
However, while the basis for agreement exists between the two main parties
to the talks, others in the 26-party forum vehemently oppose certain
aspects.
Seven people were killed yesterday when ANC supporters shot two Inkatha
Freedom party members at a funeral vigil for a regional Inkatha leader and
then mourners killed five of the attackers.
Mr Charles Nqakula, a former journalist, has been appointed general
secretary of the South African Communist party to succeed Chris Hani.

BRITAIN and China have agreed to resume talks this week on the vexed Hong
Kong issue, having concluded a first round at the weekend.
Both sides are maintaining a virtual news black-out on any progress, with
spokesmen non-committal on details since the first round resumed on Thursday
in Beijing. Britain's chief negotiator, Sir Robin McLaren, ambassador to
China, said after negotiations had concluded on Saturday: 'We're working
hard and there's hard work ahead of us, too.'
The talks - over plans by Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong governor, to broaden
the scope for popular participation in elections leading to China's takeover
of Hong Kong in 1997 - could last for weeks or months.
Beijing has repeatedly denounced Mr Patten's plan, demanding his recall and
referring to him in its official press as a prostitute and a petty thief.
China claims that Mr Patten's plan for elections in 1995 runs counter to an
agreement reached with London over arrangements for transition to Chinese
rule. Beijing officials have charged Britain with a breach of faith.
In Hong Kong, Mr Patten commented: 'Both sides know there are very difficult
issues we've got to resolve, but there has been a constructive approach.
Both sides must be glad that the talks have started in such a sensible and
balanced and businesslike way. I hope that we will be able to see progress
over the next days and weeks.'
In Beijing, a Chinese official was quoted by the official New China news
agency as saying that China hoped Britain would 'return to the correct path'
over Hong Kong.

FT  26 APR 93 / Brazil launches plan to stimulate growth
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL is making yet another attempt to stabilise its battered economy with
an emergency plan of spending cuts and acceleration of its privatisation
programme. It aims - more controversially - to stimulate 3.5 per cent growth
this year through a return to subsidies and lowering interest rates.
This long-awaited first plan of the six-month-old government of President
Itamar Franco was announced at a cabinet meeting on Saturday, broadcast live
on television.
The plan, Brazil's sixth in seven years, is the first to involve no shock
measures such as freezing prices or bank accounts.
The plan concentrates more on spending than saving, and is unclear on how to
reduce inflation, now 30 per cent a month. Mr Franco's address did not
mention inflation as a priority, though finance ministry officials say they
hope to reduce inflation to 17 per cent a month by December.
The plan will be presented to the International Monetary Fund this week by
Mr Eliseu Resende, Brazil's third finance minister in the last six months.
Analysts doubt that it will be sufficient to achieve a new IMF accord in the
near future.

FT  26 APR 93 / UK warns US against bilateral trade accords
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH government yesterday warned the Clinton administration in the US
that it would endanger the future of the free trade system if it were to
press for bilateral agreements to guarantee shares of foreign markets in
specific products.
Mr Neil Hamilton, UK trade minister, delivered the warning during a meeting
in Tokyo with Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary. They were in Tokyo at a
meeting of trade and industry ministers from eastern Europe and the Group of
Seven leading industrialised countries to plan assistance for industrial
restructuring in eastern Europe.
Mr Hamilton said he told Mr Brown the UK was opposed to 'the balkanisation
of trade by bilateral agreements'. The minister added: 'It is clearly
unhelpful to the Gatt world trade talks if countries as powerful as the US
and Japan go off and negotiate bilateral agreements. It sets a very bad
precedent which might encourage others to follow suit.'
The British concerns were raised by recent statements from the US
administration that it will seek trade agreements with Japan which would
deliver measurable progress in opening Japanese markets.
The US and Japan are due to finalise plans for a revised framework for their
trade relations in talks over the next three months.
The US is widely expected to press for agreements to deliver a specific
share of the Japanese market in key products such as supercomputers.
Mr Hamilton said: 'Mr Brown was at pains to say that the US was not seeking
Y per cent of X market - if that is the US policy, we are happy to support
such a view.'
He said US irritation with the closed character of parts of the Japanese
market was understandable, but should not lead to responses which would set
bad precedents for the international trading system.

FT  26 APR 93 / Clinton fails to join in Barclays tax suit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has broken with previous US government policy by
deciding not to file a brief in support of Barclays Bank's suit against the
California worldwide unitary tax law.
Past administrations have always argued with Barclays that California's
efforts to tax companies on a percentage of their worldwide profits, rather
than on the profits they actually make within the state, interfered with the
federal government's constitutional prerogative to 'regulate commerce with
foreign nations'.
The UK government and 19 other industrialised countries have filed arguments
against the California tax, which runs against the bilateral tax treaties
between the US and many other nations. British MPs are expected to argue for
retaliation, as permitted by a 1985 UK law, during the second reading of the
finance bill in parliament today.
The Barclays case has been rumbling through the state and federal courts for
more than a decade. California's state supreme court ruled against Barclays
last year and the issue may be approaching its final round in the US Supreme
Court.

FT  26 APR 93 / IMF may seek to expand reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHEL Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund,
is expected to press finance ministers at this week's IMF/World Bank meeting
in Washington to support moves to expand the foreign exchange reserves of
former communist and developing countries.
The IMF believes world trade is being artificially restricted because at
least 40 countries have severe shortages of reserves.
It is pressing for a new allocation of special drawing rights, an
international reserve asset equivalent to a basket of the leading
currencies.
A senior IMF official said a new issue of SDR36bn (Pounds 32.5bn), 10 per
cent of the expected demand for reserves resulting from increased global
economic activity in 1992-1996, was required.
He said rich countries, which faced no shortage of reserves, should hand
over a portion of any new SDR allocation to former communist and developing
countries as loans or grants.
The IMF would oversee this process and impose conditions so that the
reserves were used responsibly.
The official said opposition by many finance ministers to a new SDR issue -
in effect an increase in global liquidity - made no sense because
inflationary pressures were at their lowest for 30 years. Ministers had
agreed an increase in the 1980s when inflation was higher.
The share of SDRs in total world reserves had fallen from about 5 per cent
in the early 1980s to below 2 per cent.

<TEXT>
CHINA will press the European Community this week to support its entry to
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, arguing that orderly
international trading would be better served by its membership.
Mrs Wu Yi, the new minister of China's powerful ministry of foreign trade
and economic co-operation, will head the country's team in the 12th session
of the China-EC joint commission on trade and economic co-operation.
The Sino-EC meeting assumes more than usual importance this year because of
the Gatt issue, and because of continuing European misgivings over China's
large trade surplus of Dollars 13bn with EC member states.
Speaking on the eve of her departure for Europe, Mrs Wu called on the EC to
be more understanding of China as a developing country with low average per
capita income. 'We still need international understanding and support,
including that from the EC,' she told China Daily.
Beijing has been disappointed by the tough US attitude to its Gatt entry.
The US is making the running on resolving details of Chinese access to the
world trading body. One of Mrs Wu's aims will be to loosen EC support for
the US position, which China believes is partly dictated by US domestic
concerns.

FT  26 APR 93 / Export hopes ease industrial gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GLOOM in west German industry eased marginally in March, thanks to hopes
of higher export orders, although both production and order books continue
to shrink.
That is the main conclusion of the monthly report on the German business
mood published by the Munich-based Ifo institute.
In contrast, the more optimistic mood of those manufacturers still in
business in east Germany has worsened, with both the current business
situation, and the outlook for the next six months, seen to be growing less
favourable.
The average level of order books in west German industry has dropped from
2.6 to 2.5 months' production since last December, while capacity
utilisation has slipped from 80.5 to 78.5 per cent, the institute reports.
Production plans for the coming three months in the west are being sharply
reduced, but the expectation is for a continuing slowdown in price rises
too.
In primary product industries, such as chemicals, paper and cellulose
manufacturers, the decline in pessimism was also reported, although not
directly related to exports.
Investment goods producers are more sanguine about export opportunities
later in the year, although the overall mood remains extremely pessimistic.
Orders remained at the same level as February.
As for consumer durables, there was a stabilisation in orders for electrical
goods, but a continuing decline in car orders, according to survey
participants.

FT  26 APR 93 / Stakes raised in Andreotti hearing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Giulio Andreotti has raised the stakes in his battle with magistrates
seeking to remove his parliamentary immunity so that he can be questioned
for allegedly consorting with the Mafia.
By accusing the Palermo magistrates of conspiring to discredit him with
cooked evidence from former Mafia 'supergrasses', the Italian life senator
and former prime minister is no longer merely protecting his own reputation.
He has placed the 23-member Senate commission hearing his case in an
increasingly awkward position.
The hearing, which began on April 14, has turned into an inquisition that
can now reach one of only two conclusions. Either his parliamentary
colleagues regard him as 'economical with the truth' or they reject the
evidence of the Palermo magistrates.
If Mr Andreotti loses his immunity, parliament will be seen to have deserted
Italy's best known politician and confirmed the links long suspected at the
highest level between the Christian Democrat party and the Mafia.
If the decision goes the other way the public will be convinced that Mr
Andreotti is hiding behind the unacceptable device of parliamentary
immunity, and his own party will be the chief loser.
More important, any rebuff to the Palermo judiciary will undermine the state
campaign against the Mafia. Mr Giancarlo Caselli, the Palermo
attorney-general, was brought in from Turin last year after the killings of
the two leading anti-Mafia magistrates, Mr Giovanni Falcone and Mr Paolo
Borsellino, to deal decisively with the Sicilian Mafia, Cosa Nostra.
He has put behind bars several top figures in Sicily's organised crime
network, including Mr 'Toto' Riina, the alleged 'boss of bosses'. The key
has been the use of former Mafia figures who have agreed to give evidence
under plea-bargaining programmes - the pentiti (supergrasses). Their
evidence has led to the allegations against Mr Andreotti.
The evidence against Mr Andreotti comes from three main sources - Mr Tommaso
Buscetta, Mr Francesco Manino Mannoia and Mr Baldassare Di Maggio. Both Mr
Buscetta and Mr Mannoia are confessed senior members of Cosa Nostra living
in the US under witness protection programmes. Their evidence has been
central to prosecution cases in all the main Mafia trials of the past seven
years: evidence accepted up to, and including, the appeal court. Mr Di
Maggio has been co-operating with the Italian authorities for less than six
months but his evidence as former chauffeur to Mr Riina led to the latter's
capture after 23 years on the run.
All three are fundamental to Mr Riina's prosecution on charges including
multiple murder. Thus if the allegations against Mr Andreotti are dismissed,
doubts must be sown about prior evidence by these pentiti. The system of
pentiti - the most effective means of prosecuting the Mafia - is at risk.
The thrust of the accusations against Mr Andreotti is that he was for long
the Mafia's point of reference in Rome. The specific allegations range from
his being party to the decision by the Sicilian Mafia to the 1982 murder of
General Carlo Alberto della Chiesa, the Palermo chief of police, to his
links with Mr Salvatore Lima, the Euro-MP murdered last year by the Mafia
and now acknowledged in a report by the parliamentary anti-Mafia commission
to be associated with Cosa Nostra.
To these accusations last week came Mr Di Maggio's testimony of being
present when Mr Andreotti met Mr Riina, Mr Lima and other Mafia leaders in
Palermo in September 1988. Mr Andreotti has belittled the evidence as either
hearsay or unreliable.
On Thursday his allies on the Senate commission (a majority who reflect
faithfully the composition of the outgoing government coalition) secured a
further delay of five days. The excuse was the need to know the names of
individuals left blank by Palermo magistrates in the latest set of documents
supplied this week. The names had been omitted to protect the secrecy of
other anti-Mafia investigations in progress. But this delay has merely
heightened the atmosphere of confrontation.

</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE UNION leaders across Germany called on steel and engineering workers
in the eastern states to vote for all-out strike action today to protect
their pay deal for rapid wage equalisation with the west.
They warned that cancellation of the contract could undermine nationwide
collective bargaining in west Germany as well as in the east.
The outcome of the strike ballot in the states of Saxony and
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern over the next three days is in the balance, with a 75
per cent vote of all members needed to go ahead with the action.
If they vote in favour, the giant IG Metall union is expected to launch the
strike from May 3, with a warning that it could last for months.
Employers in the ailing eastern steel and engineering industries say that
100,000 workers out of some 320,000 could lose their jobs if the strike goes
ahead.
They are refusing to pay more than a 9 per cent pay rise from April 1,
compared with a deal agreed two years ago to pay a 26 per cent increase on
the wage rates existing then - equivalent to a 15.5 per cent increase on
current rates.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, leader of IG Metall, told a rally of some 60,000
workers in Leipzig on Saturday that allowing the employers to abandon their
pay deal in east Germany would threaten collective bargaining in the whole
country.
'We did not vote for reunification (of Germany) just in order to allow the
employers to turn east Germany into a cheap-wage colony,' he said.
However he left a hint of compromise: if the employers would cancel their
legal move to abrogate the eastern pay deal, the union would immediately
return to the negotiating table and discuss the timescale of wage
equalisation, he said in an interview with the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.

<TEXT>
CENARGO, the UK marine group, has postponed the inauguration of its ferry
service linking the Moroccan port of Nador and Almeria in south-east Spain
to allow time for an agreement between the Rabat and the Madrid governments
over the new shipping link.
Mr Michael Hendry, Cenargo's chairman, said yesterday the service, which was
scheduled to start today in defiance of the Spanish authorities, would
commence in 10 days time. He expected Morocco and Spain to amend next week
an existing bilateral arrangement that shares out the ferry services between
the two countries.
Cenargo claimed it was legally entitled to operate the ferry under the terms
of the EC's single market deregulation of cabotage between Community members
and third nations. Spain however, insists changes must be introduced to
their agreement with Morocco before the the EC's directive can be
implemented.

FT  26 APR 93 / Peseta remains vulnerable to further attacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BELIEF in the international money markets that Spain's foreign exchange
reserves have been drastically depleted is likely to prompt fresh attacks on
the peseta, now the weakest currency inside the European exchange rate
mechanism.
The reserves are understood by traders to have fallen as low as Dollars
20bn, well down on the Dollars 50.4bn recorded at the end of the 1992 and
below the Dollars 30bn level considered by the Finance Ministry to be the
minimum amount needed to defend the peseta.
In addition to forcing up interbank rates the Bank of Spain is thought to
have spent around Dollars 10bn of its reserves in the past few days to avert
a devaluation. Last Friday, the peseta dropped to an historic low in the ERM
of Pta74.00 against the DM.
Mr Carlos Solchaga, finance minister, pledged at the weekend to keep the
peseta within the mechanism. 'Our friends and allies in the EMS . . . are
convinced that exchange rate stability is good for the peseta and for the
EMS and that the actual level (of the peseta) is realistic,' Mr Solchaga
said.
But the Bank of Spain, which earlier this year intervened when the peseta
weakened to Pta72 against the D-Mark, now appears under pressure from the
markets to accept a rate below the peseta's central parity. Analysts say the
peseta could be pushed further down on its 6 per cent ERM band to Pta75-76
to the D-Mark, just off its Pta77 floor.
The attacks on the currency are being fuelled by Spain's recession and by
predictions of political uncertainty after general elections on June 6. An
opinion poll published yesterday by Barcelona's La Vanguardia newspaper put
the centre right Partido Popular party marginally ahead of the ruling
socialists but well short of gaining a governing majority.

WITH an easy manner, rugged looks and a shock of white hair, Mr Wim
Duisenberg has the appearance of an ageing film star. As a leading light in
the European soap opera of moves to economic and monetary union (Emu), he
will have plenty of opportunity to be centre stage in the months ahead.
Chairman of the European Community's committee of central bank governors and
head of the Dutch central bank, Mr Duisenberg appears unruffled by recent
currency market strains. He welcomes last week's cut in interest rates by
the Bundesbank as giving Europe a 'psychological boost'.
Mr Duisenberg, who is today giving his views about the European economy at
the launch in Amsterdam of the Dutch bank's annual report, reckons plans for
European monetary union are on track, even though he believes only a
relatively small group of 'core' EC nations may join the first phase of full
currency union with one central bank.
The 57-year-old economist stands out in the somewhat staid central-banking
community for his colourful and direct comments. He is probably one of the
leading candidates for the future presidency of a pan-European central bank,
assuming it is set up according to the Maastricht schedule towards the end
of this decade.
Mr Duisenberg once described the Bundesbank as being 'like whipped cream:
the more you beat it the harder it gets'. Last week he ruffled feathers in
London by criticising the UK government for not playing by the rules during
its short-lived tenure in the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
An apostle of open government, who was called in by a Labour-led Dutch
government in the 1970s for a five-year spell as finance minister, Mr
Duisenberg has for some time invited 10,000 school or university students a
year into the Dutch central bank to introduce them to high finance. He took
over as bank governor 12 years ago and is looking forward to a third
seven-year term.
As for Emu, he is playing his part by presiding over a mass of technical
work by the EC's central banks, including the design for a pan-European
banknote, in preparation for this event. Next month in Denmark he will
present to EC finance ministers an account drawn by the governors' committee
of what went wrong during the currency crisis between last September and
early this year.
He looks only slightly perturbed when asked to recall these events, which
pushed the UK and Italy out of the ERM.
The central bank chief says the pound is welcome back into the ERM, even
though if Britain wants to succeed in a future re-entry it would do well to
follow the lead of Germany and Holland by making the Bank of England rather
than government ministers responsible for monetary policy.
Mr Duisenberg gives the impression of being an Anglophile - he once wrote a
thesis on the UK's balance of payments - and says he sympathises with
Britain's predicament. Because of the large mortgage debts among
householders and the preponderance of variable-rate rather than fixed-rate
borrowing, decisions about short-term interest rates have much bigger
political implications in Britain than in most other European nations.
Even so, an independent Bank would be a vital step in increasing financial
markets' confidence.
He believes that as a trading nation Britain stands to gain by being part of
a single-currency area, even with the inevitable loss of sovereignty and
historical wrench. 'The Netherlands once had an empire too,' he quips.

ITALIAN President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro yesterday put strong pressure on the
leaders of the main parties to co-operate in forming a new government as
quickly as possible.
After three days of consultations with all 16 parties represented in
parliament, there was little sign that any of the leaders had shifted from
entrenched positions. This was despite Mr Scalfaro's aim to have a new
government agreed at the latest by today.
Mr Scalfaro alluded to widely contrasting views when he wound up his formal
consultations yesterday. 'The difficulties are there for all to see, and
everyone must confront them with absolute clarity and calm,' he said. It is
the first time that an Italian president has assumed such a direct role in
forming a new government.
Mr Giuliano Amato, the Socialist prime minister, handed in the resignation
of his four-party coalition last Thursday following the overwhelming
referendum vote in favour of electoral reform. However, Mr Scalfaro has yet
formally to accept the government's resignation.
In the search for a new prime minister, the Christian Democrats have refused
to drop their objections to the candidature of Mr Giorgio Napolitano, the
highly respected former communist who is leader of the Chamber of Deputies.
Mr Napolitano has been proposed by the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) to
head a non-partisan 'institutional' government.
The Christian Democrats say they favour a government with a clear political
base in parliament rather than relying on the prestige of a bipartisan
figure to secure a majority.
Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the Christian Democrat leader, has also been
unenthusiastic about the candidature of Mr Mario Segni, the referendum
movement leader who is backed by the Lombard League and as an alternative by
the PDS.
Among possible compromise candidates yesterday were the names of Mr Amato
himself; Mr Leopoldo Elia, a Christian Democrat senator and former president
of the constitutional court; Mr Romano Prodi, the distinguished economist
and former chairman of Iri, the state holding company; and Mr Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi, the veteran governor of the Bank of Italy.

ELENA Leskova, a 26-year-old teacher from the Russian town of Tula, south of
Moscow, stood in the polling station at school number 45 yesterday and gave
a sheepish grin.
'Last week I thought I wouldn't vote. I'm fed up with politics,' she said.
'But today the weather isn't so good and we didn't go to our dacha, so in
the end I voted for Yeltsin.'
Judging from the scenes at the polling station in this industrial Russian
city yesterday it appeared that Ms Leskova was not alone in her indecision.
Although the turnout in the region had reached 60 per cent two hours before
polls closed - above the level needed nationally to render the first two
questions on the referendum valid - there were signs of the apathy and
uncertainty that surrounded the referendum, especially outside Moscow.
'Compared to before, the turnout is not very good. But it's better than we
expected,' said Ms Nadezhda Zabotina, head of the election committee at the
Tulachermet factory, as she sat ticking off the voters on multi-coloured,
hand-drawn charts. Like most polling stations the factory was playing music
and selling cut-price snacks in an effort to attract the voters.
The expectation yesterday was that President Boris Yeltsin would receive a
majority in this town, but not a large one.
Although he received a warm welcome here on a visit during his presidential
campaign two years ago, support among the regional council and local factory
directors has evaporated, in part because the town's many arms factories
have suffered from cuts in defence spending.
Slightly over half the people questioned at polling stations yesterday said
they had voted for Mr Yeltsin, some out of enthusiasm, others from habit. 'I
voted yes to all the questions - that's what we're supposed to do, isn't
it?' said an 81-year-old pensioner, as she shuffled out of the polling
station, clutching a pot of milk.
Further along the street a group of young soldiers said they too had mostly
voted for Mr Yeltsin. Some had not. 'I voted against him because he has
betrayed his promises and it's so hard to live on our student grants,' said
Sergei, 22, a student at the local engineering institute.
Against a background of rumours of attempted vote rigging, every voting
paper had been signed in duplicate by the election committees, and the
ballot boxes stamped with the old Soviet wax seal. Observers from the
region's democratic movements and Russian Communist party were present at
most stations.
Several US observers were also in attendance. But reflecting the political
disputes now bubbling in the regions, the local election committee had
refused to recognise them officially. 'We don't want any foreign observers
or journalists here. We have enough experience of running elections,' said
Mr Andrei Tuyarkin, chairman of the regional election committee.
However, the complexities of the vote, which required voters to deal with
four separate pieces of paper, left many confused. 'It's a very crude
system,' said Mrs Rufina Vitass, 65, who had arrived at a polling station
with two other friends to vote for Mr Yeltsin. After receiving their ballot
papers, they spread them out on a table and loudly argued over them for
almost 10 minutes before agreeing on the 'correct' answers.
'I'm absolutely for Yeltsin. He is our hope for the future.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EASTERN European states should create model enterprises to serve as symbols
of economic restructuring, a meeting of trade and industry ministers from
eastern and western Europe, the US and Japan agreed yesterday.
The proposal to create enterprises as a model for restructuring in the
former communist economies came from Mr Yoshiro Mori, Japanese trade and
industry minister.
The conference, the second of ministers from the Group of Seven
industrialised countries and states of the former Soviet Union and eastern
Europe, discussed measures needed to attract foreign investment to eastern
Europe, promote privatisation, develop legal, financial and accountancy
systems, encourage the growth of small businesses and help defence factories
convert to civilian production.
The proposal for model enterprises will be studied by working groups over
the next few months, before the third ministerial conference next year, to
be held in Warsaw.
The plan is to draw up comprehensive restructuring plans from which other
enterprises could learn. The plans would cover every aspect of the
enterprise, from production methods and product mix to marketing, sales,
finance and foreign strategy.
The summary of the conference's conclusions said that only some of the 12
conditions for attracting foreign investment, outlined at last year's
conference, such as freedom to remit profits, had been satisfied.
Business leaders at the conference outlined a long list of other conditions,
such as acceptable living and working conditions for foreign staff and
better telecommunications, so there shall be an increase in foreign
investment.
Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, said there was growing support for the
Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn) privatisation fund which the US administration
had first outlined at the G7 finance and industry ministers' meeting on
Russia, in Tokyo two weeks ago.

FT  26 APR 93 / Current Account Problems in E Europe

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland and Romania experienced a
large deterioration in their current account balance of payments towards the
end of last year, according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, Peter Norman writes.
The deterioration, which has clearly concerned officials at the bank,
reflects a sharp and unexpected decline in export growth and higher imports
of consumer rather than investment goods.
In its latest quarterly review, the EBRD says the fall in exports may
reflect temporary factors, including a drought, but warns that more lasting
factors, such as structural difficulties in agriculture, increased budget
deficits, EC import quotas and lower personal savings, could also be
involved.

AT THE headquarters of the Writers Union of the USSR - alias polling station
number 3 in Moscow's Krasnopresenski district - they were doing a brisk
trade yesterday lunchtime. Of the 3,000 voters registered for the area, 500
had trooped in from the spring sunshine during the 5 1/2 hours since polls
opened. An informal survey suggests they were overwhelmingly voting Yes to
Yeltsin.
Pavel Kozhen, first voter of the day, anticipated the emerging trend in his
answers to the main ballot questions: yes to Yeltsin, yes to his economic
reforms, no to pre-term presidential elections, and yes to parliamentary
elections - in the words of the campaign slogan, da, da, niet, da.
Nina Malachkova, an 83-year-old 'veteran of labour' from Soviet days and an
official poll observer, had been at station 3 since 6.30 am. Chivvying
dawdling voters in slippers and housecoat, she had no doubt about how they
should vote. 'My whole family is united in support of Yeltsin and reform,
and so is a majority of people in Moscow. Life is very hard, but most people
know that without these reforms it would be worse.'
Moscow is not typical, not least because its voters have been under a
constant barrage of referendum propaganda. But street interviews yesterday
revealed an interest in, and understanding of, the referendum that seemed to
belie the image of the post-Soviet citizen as downtrodden and apathetic.
At Izmailovo market, a sprawling bazaar in the shadow of a sports stadium on
the outskirts of Moscow, lunchtime buying and selling was keeping many from
the polling booths. But all the traders surveyed had voted or intended to.
Volodya Rusin, 27, a caretaker during the week but a hawker of Soviet
memorabilia at the weekend, was for Yeltsin, although his support for the
president was less than enthusiastic. 'They used to call what I am doing
speculation,' he said. 'If Yeltsin loses, communism will come back and we'll
have to stop trading. If Yeltsin wins, at least things won't get any worse.'
Viktor Sensov, a journalist and bookseller, had voted for Yeltsin but
against his policies. 'We are against the parliament, but we are concerned
about Yeltsin,' he said. 'He is a man with courage but without policies.'
Tatyana Sultanova, another bookseller, refused to endorse either the
president or his parliamentary opponents but voted for new elections for
both. 'I am against all of them, because all they do is help themselves. I
want young and clever people to enter politics.'
But for the young, Yeltsin still seems to promise a better future. Slaking
his thirst outside a cafe, Mikhail Borokov, 24, a worker in the Zil
limousine plant, said: 'Things will get better if Yeltsin wins, but it will
take five to 10 years. Under communism young people couldn't breathe. But
Yeltsin is giving everybody the chance to trade, to own land, to be free.
Younger people believe in Yeltsin because they have time to wait.'

FT  26 APR 93 / Privatisation before restructuring, says bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATISATION and the encouragement of new small and medium enterprises and
greenfield investments should take priority over attempts to restructure
state-owned companies in eastern Europe, the EBRD has concluded from the
first three years' experience of transforming centrally planned into market
economies.
Access to export markets was also critical to the success of economic
transformation in the region, Mr Guy de Selliers, the EBRD's deputy head of
merchant banking, told a seminar on privatisation and restructuring attended
by heads of privatisation agencies throughout the region.
Mr Lajos Csepi, head of the Hungarian state property agency, said that with
competition for foreign investment from all the former Soviet states, and
many of the best companies already privatised, Hungary's favourable
treatment by foreign investors was over.
Future privatisation would have to rely more on domestic savings and
'alleviated terms of sale'. To broaden the scope of privatisation Hungary
planned a mass privatisation programme (MPP) next year to mobilise small
savers. It will also offer leasing, instalment payments, subsidised credits
and 'all reasonable ways' of encouraging domestic entrepreneurs to takeover
the hundreds of less attractive Hungarian companies still awaiting either
privatisation or liquidation.
Germany's Treuhand privatisation agency, endowed with billions of marks to
facilitate the process, found it 'easier to get financial assistance than to
find internationally recognised managers experienced in turning round
companies to work for a short time in eastern Germany', said Ms Birgit
Breuel, Treuhand president.

FT  26 APR 93 / Turn gunmen into taxmen - EBRD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COUNTRIES of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union should retrain
military personnel and surplus civil servants as tax collectors, to
strengthen fiscal reform in the former Communist states, the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development says.
In its latest quarterly economic review, the bank identifies tax
administration and legislation as two areas where the former communist
countries must make improvements in their efforts to build market-oriented
economies.
They 'need to get their tax structures right early on. Otherwise it will be
difficult to tackle tax evasion later,' says Mr Mario Sarcinelli, EBRD vice
president responsible for development banking.
The EBRD says present tax systems are 'particularly unsatisfactory' in their
treatment of corporate profits, with accounting rules often resulting in an
excessive tax burden.
The EBRD says the tax burden is excessive in many eastern and central
European countries, and says the need to encourage entrepreneurship and
capital accumulation in the new market economies argues for a low level of
tax.
Although the EBRD report gives clear advice on the need to improve the tax
gathering system, it is less explicit about the need for lower state
spending. This reflects a lively debate within the bank over the merits and
demerits of sharp spending cuts in the former Communist states.
While the EBRD says efforts should be made to reduce state spending and
taxes in parallel, it also notes that countries in central and eastern
Europe have large elderly populations and rapidly growing unemployment that
create a need for big social transfers. Although cuts in social security and
welfare payments might be achieved by a better targeting of benefits, it
warns it would be difficult to reduce tax rates in the new market economies.

EC FOREIGN ministers left open the possibility of using military force
against the Bosnian Serbs at the end of their two-day meeting at Hindsgavl
Castle in Denmark, but made it clear they will exert that option with
profound reluctance and only under pressure from the US.
Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, the Danish foreign minister who chaired the talks,
echoed majority sentiment when he told a news conference yesterday that he
remained unconvinced about the value of military intervention. 'I have great
difficulty in seeing the really positive aspect and why it would go a long
way to solve the problem (in Yugoslavia).'
But Mr Petersen, a member of Denmark's Radical Liberal party, which has a
strong pacifist streak, seemed unclear whether the tighter UN sanctions due
to go into effect today would persuade the Bosnian Serbs to sign the
Vance-Owen plan sponsored by the EC and UN.
After being reminded that Serbia-Montenegro - the rump republics of former
Yugoslavia - had already been threatened with expulsion from all
international organisations without obvious effect, Mr Petersen issued a
correction. On April 30, a meeting of the United Nations Industrial
Development Organisation was due to take place; and he for one was adamant
that Serbia should not be allowed to attend.
Ministers insisted, but without great conviction, that the tighter sanctions
approved by the UN a week ago would start to bite. They noted the raging
inflation in Serbia, and the sharp fall in imports; and they pledged to
enforce the sanctions more effectively - possibly through a 'Super
Co-ordinator' who could make the many international organisations such as
the CSCE, West European Union, EC, and the United Nations work more
efficiently. The most telling point, however, was that the EC/UN team had
not had enough people to operate around the clock to block traffic on the
Danube.
Tougher noises emanated from the French and British, who supply the bulk of
the UN force in Bosnia. Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, said
lifting the arms embargo against the Bosnian Moslems or supplying large
numbers of ground forces were not acceptable; but France was ready to
discuss tighter sanctions and possible selective air strikes.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said air strikes needed to be
consistent with international law, with due regard to UK troops and the
overall UN humanitarian effort to supply besieged towns.
Despite their common reservations about military intervention, the French
and British positions are blurred because London does not share Paris's
desire for a new UN resolution. Partly, this reflects France's desire not to
be marching to US orders; but it also suggests France believes there are
political benefits in Russian support.
This week, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, or possibly Mr
Reginald Bartholomew, the US special envoy, is expected in Europe for
further consultations with the UK and France. He will discover an EC
hesitant, divided and frustrated - and once again looking to the US for a
lead.

FT  26 APR 93 / Britain set on closer EC ties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday signalled that it intends to join its EC partners in
closer European political and economic co-operation if Denmark rejects the
Maastricht treaty in next month's referendum.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, made clear that there was no question
of Britain joining Denmark outside the EC in the event of a second Danish
'No'.
Speaking in Denmark at the end of a two-day meeting of EC foreign ministers,
Mr Hurd said if the Danes rejected Maastricht next month, the treaty would
not proceed. But he added: 'Of course, I am not saying we would not take
part in further arrangements.'
Mr Hurd's position echoed the UK government's recent enthusiastic
pro-European line, which matches a growing confidence that the Tory
Euro-sceptics are on the run and that the treaty is likely to be ratified at
Westminster by the end of the summer.
Mr Hurd made clear yesterday that he expected the Danes to support the
treaty in the May 18 referendum - a view supported by recent opinion polls
showing a clear lead for the Yes campaign.
At the Edinburgh summit last December, France, Germany, Belgium and Spain
all warned the UK and Denmark that failure to ratify Maastricht would prompt
other countries to launch new treaty arrangements.
Mr Hurd's explicit commitment to closer European co-operation contrasts with
a much more guarded approach to future EC treaty arrangements last year,
when the UK suggested that it might not take part in a future EC effort to
recreate or expand on Maastricht in the event of a Danish or British
rejection.
Philip Stephens, Political Editor, adds: Mr John Major has made it clear
that there could be no question of Britain pressing ahead with ratification
of Maastricht if the Danes vote 'no' on May 18.
But Mr Hurd's comments will nonetheless inflame the anger of the Tory
Euro-sceptics. In the past the government has sought to limit the size of
the Conservative rebellion against Maastricht by insisting that it would not
allow the rest of the Community to leave Denmark behind.

FT  26 APR 93 / Yeltsin heads for victory on key poll issue

<TEXT>
MR BORIS Yeltsin was last night heading for victory on a key issue in the
Russian referendum with early results showing a clear majority of voters
declaring trust in him as president.
However, his attempt to achieve the degree of backing which he requires to
force new parliamentary elections was in the balance.
The delayed struggle between president and parliament is likely to resume,
in heightened form, as both sides interpret the referendum differently. If
the early results are confirmed, Mr Yeltsin will claim a mandate for
sweeping economic and constitutional change while parliament will insist
that his failure to win the majority of the 106m electorate has deprived him
of authority for radical action on any issue.
A Russian television exit poll in 16 cities across the country showed Mr
Yeltsin winning 75 per cent support in the vote of confidence, the first of
the four questions being asked yesterday.
Both the first and the second question, which asks Russians whether they
support economic reforms started in 1992, require only a 50 per cent
majority of those who voted. An exit poll of just over 5,000 voters by the
Russian Centre for Public Opinion and Market Research found 56 per cent
backing market reforms: parliament insisted on the question and a resounding
No might have been expected, given the hardship caused by the reforms.
The third and fourth questions, on early presidential and parliamentary
elections, require a majority of the electorate.
The first results, from the Koryak autonomous district, from some districts
in the city of Magadan and from the town of Anadyr, all in the far east,
showed around 70 per cent of those voting answering Yes to the question on
trust in the president - which Mr Yeltsin had identified as the most
important to him. There were lower majorities supporting economic reform.
High percentages voted for re-election of the parliament in many areas. But,
according to the pro-Yeltsin Public Headquarters for the Referendum, low
turnout meant this was not enough to secure the 50 per cent majority of the
total electorate required by the Constitutional Court for early elections.
In the far eastern city of Khabarovsk, only 25 per cent of the eligible
electorate supported early parliamentary elect-ions.
Mr Yeltsin has already indicated, however, that he would consider a simple
majority enough to dissolve the parliament and push through a new
constitution which the old-style Congress of People's Deputies has resisted.
In the preliminary Magadan results, 60 per cent of the total electorate
supported new parliamentary elections. In the president's own home town of
Yekaterinburg, this figure was more than 50 per cent.
The turnout was reported by local representatives of the president to be
averaging 60 per cent or a little over - not high by Russian standards, but
higher than feared by some of the president's aides, especially in good
weather which tempted many to their country houses.
By mid-afternoon, it was clear that over 50 per cent had voted - the
qualifying mark for the referendum to be valid.

FT  26 APR 93 / 'I thought stuff the IRA' and Sunday service went ahead

THE SPIRIT of the blitz returned to the City of London yesterday as an army
of contractors' lorries queued at first light down London Wall, waiting to
help repair the damage caused by the latest terrorist attack.
'It was like the troops waiting to embark on D-Day,' said a Guildhall
official. Platoons of glaziers had started out for the City before first
light.
By 7am, as key holders moved among the rubble and police cordons in the
drizzle, about 200 contractors were waiting at the door of Guildhall. City
landlords were on hand offering office space to those displaced by the
blast. Two hours later the crowd had swelled to 600.
Inside the Lord Mayor was telling the world that while the pictures told a
story of devastation, the spirit of London would beat the terrorists.
Throughout the day he held the line.
At St Paul's Cathedral, the dean, the Rev Eric Evans, was moved to draw an
historical metaphor: 'This great city has faced plague, pestilence, fire and
the blitz and it has won through. It will do so again and the IRA have no
more hope of killing the spirit of London and its people than Hitler had.'
Many of the victims were cared for at St Bartholomew's Hospital. Few could
resist reflecting that, if its history is abruptly ended by government
closure, the City may indeed lose a vital amenity which has served it
through many wars.
In St Botolph's churchyard, green spring buds, blown from trees by the
blast, mingled with shards of glass. Its leaded windows were bowed, and its
heavy doors cracked, but the church appeared to have survived.
St Botolph's was silent, but a few hundred yards away the bells rang out in
defiance for morning service at St Michael Cornhill, one of the City's Wren
churches, which suffered damage to its stained glass windows.
The Rev David Burton Evans, the rector, had guided his choir and
congregation under the police tapes. The churchgoers, choir and organist
numbered only 19. 'I thought stuff the IRA and we went ahead and did it.'
But at St Ethelburga's the bells may never ring again. The church,
originally built before the Great Fire of London and which survived the
Victorian building boom and the Blitz, was reduced to rubble. The smallest
and one of the oldest churches in London's business district had taken the
full force of the blast.
The weedkiller bomb packed into a tipper truck left a crater nearly 20 feet
deep and 30 feet wide. All that was left of the truck were small twisted
bits of metal.
Among the destruction there was a touch of wartime humour as an office
worker from the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation watched paper
blowing in the breeze. 'Our computer data is all safe, but our files are
spread around the City. If anyone sees a piece of paper with our logo on,
could they kindly pick it up and return it to us?'
In those early hours of the morning Bishopsgate resembled a sea of glinting
blue glass. Two Barclays bank cash machines sat askew in their housings. The
window had caved in on a security shop called Bishopsgate Crime Prevention
Centre.
By mid-afternoon on Saturday, Emergency Dealing Services was offering
displaced dealers desks and telephones in two offices at Butlers Wharf,
Tower Bridge and Chiswell Street, Shoreditch. 'I started setting this up
after the St Mary Axe bomb last year,' said stockbroker Terry Galgey.
Ms Janine Barber, an executive director of IndoSuez Aval in St Helen's
Place, just off Bishopsgate and near to the centre of the blast, said: 'We
got hit by the last bomb, we've just had a burglary and now we have had this
so we've learnt to cope by now.'

FT  26 APR 93 / Calls for tighter security: Anti-IRA campaign criticised as
City is bombed for second time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK, RICHARD WATERS and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT faces calls to sharpen its anti-terrorist campaign after a
massive IRA bomb in the City of London left one man dead and caused damage
provisionally estimated at more than Pounds 300m.
As thousands of City workers were confronted with the prospect of being
moved into temporary office space, the prime minister will come under
pressure from backbenchers for a much wider review of the government's
efforts to halt the IRA's mainland bombing campaign.
Senior ministers, however, were cautioning last night against any
'knee-jerk' response that would add to the propaganda value for the IRA of
the latest attack.
Downing Street was seeking to avoid a formal Commons statement on the
bombing because of its longstanding view that government should not add to
the publicity on which the IRA thrives.
Two other bombs exploded on Saturday night, destroying minicabs hijacked by
terrorists to attack Downing Street and New Scotland Yard. The drivers
ignored instructions and alerted police. One explosion was near King's Cross
station, the other in Finsbury Park.
The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said early estimates of the damage
inflicted by the City bombing, which have run as high as Pounds 1bn, may
prove to be exaggerated.
It said the damage was likely to be on the same scale as last year's Baltic
Exchange bombing.
The government signalled last night that it was ready to pick up most of the
bill for the devastation. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, sought to
underpin confidence in London's position by emphasising that the government
was 'playing its part' by acting as reinsurer of last resort against
terrorist attacks.
Sir Francis McWilliams, Lord Mayor of London, co-ordinating the effort to
clear up the City and protect its reputation as Europe's leading financial
centre, said as he toured the devastated area: 'The Stock Exchange will be
working, Lloyd's (insurance market) will be working, the Baltic Exchange
will be working, Liverpool Street station will be open and London
Underground will be working.'
Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the Corporation of the City of London's
policy committee, estimated that at least 20,000 people might need to be
temporarily relocated from offices nearest the blast.
Mr David Mellor, the former cabinet minister, called for a review of
security policy, echoing the private view of many ministers and Tory MPs
that the government's counter-terrorist effort needs to be sharpened.
Mr Owen Kelly, City of London police commissioner, called for extended
anti-terrorist powers. He said: 'I want the power to set up road checks
wherever and whenever, without specific reason for doing so.'
Mr Major plans to use a speech this morning to the annual meeting of the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to underline his
government's determination not to bow to terrorism. The prime minister will
emphasise also that the government will intensify its efforts to improve
security against further attacks.
Mr Lamont, who is hosting the EBRD meeting, said: 'I have every confidence
that business will continue to locate here and work here successfully. To do
otherwise would be to succumb to terrorism.'
That message was echoed in private talks yesterday between the Lord Mayor
and Mr Major, who indicated that the government would stick to its
commitment to underwrite the insurance costs, even though legislation to set
up such arrangements has not yet been passed by the Commons. Mr Major has
invited Sir Francis to another meeting this week to discuss further action
to tighten security in the City, particularly at night and during weekends.
In the City, officials said at least two buildings would be demolished and
another 20 would need important structural repairs.
One man died and 44 were injured in the explosion on Saturday, for which the
IRA formally claimed responsibility yesterday afternoon. The dead man was Mr
Ed Henty, a News of the World photographer.
The blast affected a wider area than the bombing at the Baltic Exchange in
April last year - partly because Bishopsgate is a wider street - although
much of the damage beyond the core area was relatively minor.
The City Corporation co-ordinated the clear-up of more than 200 tons of
broken glass from the streets throughout the weekend.

VERA LYNN may have given way to Gordon Gecko years ago, but the spirit of
the Blitz returned to the City of London yesterday. There were other
reminders: the innocent victims, an unseen enemy, and those with an eye for
the main chance.
An army of repair contractors' lorries queued at first light down London
Wall, waiting for the off. 'It was like the troops waiting to embark on
D-Day,' said a Guildhall official. Platoons of glaziers had started out for
the City before first light.

FT  24 APR 93 / UK Company News: Cleaning up for the market - Sir Phil
Harris's float of Carpetright
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE re-emergence of Sir Phil Harris as chairman of a quoted company, through
the flotation of Carpetright of London, due in the early summer at a value
of around Pounds 75m to Pounds 100m, will bring back many memories for
investors. Some of these will be happy, some less so.
Sir Phil seems determined that he will avoid some of the problems of his
former company, Harris Queensway. That was eventually taken over for Pounds
450m in 1988, though not until Sir Phil had attempted a management buy-out
Some investors who sold out when Sir Phil did made money, although Harris
Queensway's peak market value was Pounds 600m before the 1987 crash. Those
who stuck with Lowndes Queensway, as it became, lost their money when it
failed in 1990. High interest rates put up the cost of its debt at the same
time as hitting consumer spending.
Even before the takeover, Harris Queensway was a classic 1980s retail story.
It had expanded rapidly through takeovers - Sir Phil says he did 38 in all -
and outside its original focus of carpet retailing.
This time round, says Sir Phil, Carpetright is a 'clean company'. By that he
means 'no takeovers, all the shop leases are straightforward, new store
opening costs are all written off at the time, any stock losses are taken
straight away. It's a very simple structure - there are no complications'.
Carpetright, he promises, will stick to selling carpets and not move into
areas such as furniture, electrical goods, discount shops, even toys as
Harris Queensway did. Takeovers are out, except for buying stores. For those
of Sir Phil's followers who regard him as the 'carpet king' that will be
reassuring news.
Carpetright dates back to 1988, soon after the Harris Queensway takeover.
Sir Phil refused to sign a non-competition agreement and was rapidly back in
business. Because store sites were hard to get then, Carpetright was a joint
venture with MFI Furniture, the retailer which floated last year, and opened
stores on MFI sites.
At first Sir Phil did not take executive control, but early losses and the
need for extra finance brought him back to the chief executive job three
years ago. He brought in a number of colleagues from Harris Queensway days.
Since then profits have risen sharply. A pre-tax figure of Pounds 351,000 in
1990-91 rose to Pounds 2.8m the next year. That was beaten in the first of
the current year (to end April) when profit reached Pounds 3.4m. The full
year's figures will be shown in the prospectus, but analysts are looking for
over Pounds 7m.
Sir Phil takes pride in saying 'we've done it through a recession.' The
chain is now second place in the highly fragmented carpet market, and Sir
Phil has plans to open another 22 to 25 shops a year, taking the total from
the current 115 to 200 in the next three to four years.
That would take Carpetright's market share, he reckons, from 6 per cent to
12 to 15 per cent, giving it market leadership. It could be achieved with
little addition to central costs, he believes, and the implication is that
profits growth will continue rapidly.
All that growth will be internally financed, he says, and the group has no
debt. He also promises that given Carpetright's strong cash generation, 'we
will be generous with dividends'.
The outlook seems rosy. But investors tempted by the float may have a few
concerns. First, Sir Phil's plans go no further than the 200 store target.
After that, he says, there are no further economies of scale to be gained
from suppliers.
He has vague ideas about moving into Europe but nothing concrete. While this
is not a matter for immediate concern, the history of retailers moving
abroad is not good and Sir Phil's experience outside the UK is slim.
There is also the question of MFI's position. It still holds a 20 per cent
stake in Carpetright and has yet to decide whether to sell its shares in the
flotation. It would seem odd for MFI to retain a 20 per cent stake without
keeping a seat on the board.
Mr Derek Hunt, who was chairman of Carpetright, and his colleague, Mr John
Randall, who was a non-executive director, have both left the board. Mr Hunt
says that they did not want to get involved in another float and were
anxious to devote their time to MFI.
Sir Phil, his family and his charitable trusts will own about 40 per cent of
the shares. However, this proportion is likely to reduce, as the charities
sell shares to raise money. The prospectus will also say that Sir Phil could
sell a limited number of shares each year for tax planning and charitable
reasons.
Investors with long memories may need a little more reassurance about the
strength and depth of management, and the financial controls at Carpetright,
two perceived weaknesses of the former Harris Queensway.
On the plus side, as well as the projected growth in profits, there is the
near perfect timing of the float just as the economic recovery appears to be
getting underway. There is little doubt that so long as the issue is
correctly priced, and the recent recovery in the housing market does not
suddenly reverse, the float should be a success.

Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK's biggest manufacturer, reports
first-quarter results on Thursday in the crucial run-up to floating Zeneca,
its bioscience subsidiary. Analysts expect pre-tax profits of about Pounds
180m compared with about Pounds 211m for the same period last year. They
will be looking at the extent of the impact of the slowdown in continental
Europe, particularly in fibres, as well as the upturn in films,
polyurethanes and acrylics in the US. The extent of benefits from
cost-cutting will also be watched carefully.
Tarmac is expected to announce 1992 pre-tax losses of up to Pounds 355m on
Tuesday. The company also is expected to adopt the FRS 3 accounting
standard, which means that provisions of more than Pounds 300m will be taken
above the line. The final dividend of 5.5p is expected to be maintained. The
market will want to know what progress the company's disposal programme is
making, particularly the planned sale of its waste disposal business.
With discount food retailers threatening the supermarket chains, investors
will take a keen interest in results of Kwik Save on Thursday. Interim
pre-tax profits could be up as much as 20 per cent to about Pounds 60m as
more price-conscious consumers turn to it.

FT  24 APR 93 / The Lex Column: French equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 3.5 per cent fall in French equities this week - despite two interest
rate cuts - was more than a display of Gallic indifference. The last day of
the trading account contributed to yesterday's slide, so the new account may
begin on a firmer note on Monday. But the downbeat tone this month suggests
wider disillusionment. International funds in particular bought French
equities earlier this year, expecting at least modest economic growth.
Despite the easing of interest rates, that now looks optimistic.
An outflow of foreign money would not matter if some of the FFr1,100bn
savings invested in money market funds at home shifted into shares. A
similar flow of retail money supported Wall Street through periods of
economic doubt. But with real interest rates in France still over 6 per
cent, the avalanche of retail cash looks some way off, especially since the
Bundesbank's cut this week confirmed the slow pace of German rate
reductions. The market may be entering an uncomfortable period of poor
company results, worsening growth prospects and no obvious constituency of
buyers.
The government's enthusiasm for reducing the budget deficit is a wild card.
Although flotations of state-owned companies could be a drag on the equity
market, privatisation might also include tax incentives for equity
investors. If the government is serious about fiscal discipline, though, Mr
Balladur's threat of higher taxes this week must also be taken seriously.
With economic confidence so fragile, such measures will do equities no good
at all.

FT  24 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Yielding to pressure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A marked fall in the FT-SE 100 index while the FT-SE mid-250 remains unmoved
should be treated with some caution. Market games are not beyond the
manipulation of FT-SE 100 futures prices with a consequent overspill into
blue chip stocks. At the end of a week, when the long-awaited recovery was
confirmed, a little disappointment is understandable.
Still, there are reasons to fear that UK equities have run out of steam.
Large cash calls such as Zeneca and BT III are on the horizon. Base rates
seem to have stopped falling, with the government happy to wait and watch
sterling rise against continental currencies. That removes some momentum
from the switch from cash into equities. Gilts may also fall back as the
optimism over lower interest rates fades and the market has to trudge
through the interminable supply of government debt. While not that
expensive, equities are no longer cheap against gilts - and any rise in gilt
yields may put pressure on the stock market.
Perhaps the most worrying aspect is the fall in equity yields below 4 per
cent. The last three occasions when this happened were 1987, 1973/4 and
1968/9. Those inclined to be generous may argue that a more benign inflation
outlook permits lower yields than in the past. More nervous souls may regard
the lull in inflation as a normal pause after devaluation. In 12 months'
time, retail price inflation might not look so subdued. Low dividend cover
and the limited capacity for growth in payments also cast a shadow over low
yields. If inflation turns up, neither gilt nor equity returns will look
that generous.

FT  24 APR 93 / International Company News: IBM spins off unit with Zschau
as its chairman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines has spun off Adstar, its data storage
business unit, and appointed Mr Ed Zschau, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and
politician as chairman and chief executive.
Mr Zschau is a former Republican Congressman and founder of System
Industries, a data storage systems company. He will oversee Adstar's
business strategy and financial performance. He has been made an IBM
vice-president.
The move represents a step forward in IBM's plans to transform itself into a
federation of independent business units. However, Mr Jack Kuehler, IBM
vice-chairman, said it should not be seen as presaging a public offering of
Adstar stock.
Adstar is one of IBM's most important business units, with 1992 sales of
Dollars 6.1bn and net earnings, before restructuring charges, of Dollars
247m. At the end of 1992, it employed almost 16,000 people at plants in the
US, Europe and Asia.
As a stand-alone business it is the largest manufacturer of data storage
products.
This is IBM's first restructuring decision since the arrival of Mr Louis
Gerstner, who took up his post as IBM chair-man and chief executive on April
1.
The appointment of an outsider to head an IBM business unit is
unprecedented. It suggests that Mr Gerstner, himself the first non-IBM
executive to be elected chairman, may be looking outside IBM to fill leading
posts.
Mr Zschau said that his goal at Adstar would be to 'revolutionise the
information storage industry and achieve exceptional commercial success.
'With entrepreneurial spirit, we'll create new products and new markets and
move faster to leverage Adstar's unique resources.'

<TEXT>
ARGENTARIA, the state-owned Spanish banking corporation which is being
partially privatised, yesterday priced its global public offering at
Pta3,800 (Dollars 32.75) a share. The pricing, at the upper end of the
Pta3,500 to Pta3,950 range announced three weeks ago, reflected a strong
demand.
More than 450,000 domestic retailers have registered their interest in
acquiring Argentaria shares, a number that is in excess of double the number
of total shareholders that the bank expected when it said it was putting 25
per cent of its equity on the market.
According to FG, the Madrid securities firm, demand for Argentaria paper in
the US, where 4m shares are being offered, is about 14m shares. In the UK,
demand is for about 15m shares where 3.5m shares are being offered. Morgan
Stanley International is acting as co-ordinator in the placement.
The US public offering of 8m American depository shares, representing the 4m
common shares, is expected to start shortly after the May 5 close of the
subscription period for domestic retail investors.

FT  24 APR 93 / Man in the News: Jumping flash Jacques - Jacques Attali /
The complicated boss of the EBRD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, enjoys a reputation spanning several continents for grandeur in
intellect and lifestyle. But, even as the storm clouds gather above him, he
can also demonstrate phlegmatic humour.
At a news conference at the bank's London headquarters on Thursday, the man
in the middle of the controversy about EBRD overspending perched on the edge
of a vast podium. It was as if a well-attired Sorbonne professor was doing
his best to approach a bevy of slightly unsavoury students.
Mr Attali, who describes himself first as a writer, and only second as the
president of an international bank, acknowledged it was not the first time -
and it would not be the last - that he faced criticism.
The expectant crowd of journalists were tossed some finely-packaged
understatements. 'It's nice to see you all here today. But I would have
preferred to find other ways of doing our advertising.'
Two years ago, after serving for 10 years as special adviser to President
Francois Mitterrand, Mr Attali was catapulted into the top job at the
French-inspired bank, set up to channel western resources to the former
Soviet bloc.
To weather the international rumpus which has surfaced over allegations of
EBRD mismanagement, Mr Attali will need reserves of both humour and
stoicism.
He will also have to draw on resources which, in a mercurial career on the
international governmental circuit, he has so far displayed in abundance: a
well-honed capacity for rapid thinking, and friends in high places.
The panache demonstrated at Thursday's press conference shows the
quick-footedness is still intact. But, as irritation grows with Mr Attali's
conduct among important EBRD shareholder governments, the friends are
becoming a great deal thinner on the ground.
Described by his friends as a polymath visionary, by his adversaries as a
jealous gadfly who plagiarises other people's ideas, Mr Attali attracts a
welter of emotions. 'Jacques is a genius,' one European ambassador said
yesterday. He then described his government's annoyance about the bank's
high spending at a time of recession in east and west. 'All that marble and
glitter is the wrong signal,' he said.
Indicating the problems sometimes touched off by Mr Attali's
high-handedness, the diplomat added that he and others had been irritated by
being kept waiting by Mr Attali at the ceremony inaugurating the bank's
expensive new headquarters last month.
One important EBRD director, who in the past has strongly defended Mr
Attali, pointedly said yesterday that Mr Attali lacked the 'experience of
running international and national bureacracies' to do his job properly.
Mr Attali, of febrile energy and bubbling mind, is a complex personality
caught in a maze of contradictions. 'He is a man of intelligence, culture
and general aptitude,' Mr Pierre Mauroy, President Mitterrand's first
Socialist prime minister, said yesterday. 'But he's more of a theoretician
than a practical man.'
'He's a man who provides ideas, but the problem is putting them into
effect,' said Mr Horst Teltschik, the former foreign policy adviser to
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who developed a good working relationship with Mr
Attali during the 1980s - including during the helter-skelter negotiations
on German reunification.
Mr Teltschik, now a board member at BMW, the Munich-based car company,
recalls Mr Attali's proposals for the Group of Seven industrial countries to
aid Bangladesh with a massive irrigation project. The proposals foundered on
the complexities of rechannelling the country's rivers on the borders.
Mr Attali's capabilities as a writer of books and film scripts are
legendary, while his speeches simmer with proposals for curbing the dangers
facing the world. In view of the threat that eastern instability could spill
westwards, he says a post-cold war 'cultural change' in Europe is in the
west's best interests: 'We need a consensus for action - to make people
dream and be frightened of what could happen in the 21st century.'
The contradictions surrounding Mr Attali focus on the nature of the bank's
lending role in a difficult economic environment, as well as on the diverse
expectations vested in it by its 56 shareholder governments. But, most of
all, they concern the character of Mr Attali himself.
For long regarded as a power-broker who has used his closeness to Mr
Mitterrand to further his own career, Mr Attali is starting to resemble a
Machiavelli entangled in his own network of intrigue.
One of the more fascinating complexities concerns his own country. One
banker in Paris yesterday said Mr Attali - born 49 years ago in Algeria into
a French Jewish commercial family - remains an outsider on the French
banking scene. 'People believe he has come on too fast, that he's not a real
banker.'
The French capital is abuzz with 'conspiracy theories', the banker added,
that the allegations of the EBRD's budgetary misdemeanours have been leaked
by the British authorities. In view of the recent accession of a right-wing
government in Paris, which has left Mr Mitterrand as Mr Attali's sole
important protector, the revelations are hitting Mr Attali at a time of
maximum vulnerability, the banker added.
Another Paris banking functionary says Paris financiers are displeased that
the British government won the location of the EBRD in exchange for
acceptance of Mr Attali as its first president. 'The bank site is durable,
but Mr Attali may not be.'
Before he won the EBRD job, Mr Attali's ambition was to return to his
previous university career. The varying nature of Mr Attali's talents was
reflected in his biography written in 1985 of Sir Siegmund Warburg, the
founder of the London bank which bears his name.
Mr Attali's description of the financier as 'a man of influence . . .
vigilant of the dangers in the world, a councillor of princes' throws
considerable light on his own personality.
The book has been criticised by some reviewers. But Sir David Scholey,
chairman of S G Warburg, yesterday described the book as 'a generous
impression of Sir Siegmund'. Sir David added: 'The book showed a lot about
Attali's fascination with the role of Jewish banking families over the
centuries in the state finances and state affairs of Europe.'
In at least one case, however, Mr Attali's writing zeal has lengthened his
list of enemies. He upset President George Bush with a book a few years ago
predicting the US would decline under a mountain of debt, drugs and decay.
Within the bank itself, Mr Attali has a large number of supporters. Mr Ron
Freeman, first vice-president in charge of merchant banking, who functions
as joint number two to Mr Attali in the bank's hierarchy, says, 'If I didn't
approve of him, I wouldn't be working here. It's hard to imagine that anyone
else taking over from day one could have got us so far, so quickly.'
Mrs Margaret (now Baroness) Thatcher also had 'a sneaking admiration' for Mr
Attali, according to Sir Charles Powell, now a director of London-based
financial services company Matheson. 'Mrs Thatcher is not dissimilar - she
can also sometimes trample over people's feelings,' he said.
Sir Charles, who as the former British prime minister's private secretary
from 1974 to 1981 forged ties with both Mr Attali and Mr Teltschik, says of
Mr Attali: 'I like him very much. He's very exhilarating, stimulating,
infuriating, volatile and difficult to pin down.'
Sir Charles highlights the cultural differences which, allied to Mr Attali's
impetuousness and lack of experience of running organisations, have provided
a principal cause of the EBRD furore.
Reflecting on Mr Attali's well-publicised liking for executive jet travel,
Sir Charles says: 'He's a free spirit - he loves that sort of thing.' In
bilateral Anglo-French negotiations, 'I would trundle over to Paris in
British Airways tourist class, while Jacques would arrive in a presidential
jet in Northolt aerodrome.'
The same clash of national styles, says Sir Charles, has led to the acrimony
over the lavish fitting out of the EBRD building. 'Attali is a man for the
glory of France . . . He's entrenched in the tradition of the Versailles
summit, extravagant public works on the back of national prosperity. And now
he's come to a place with a different tradition.'
Mr Attali's elevation to the helm of the EBRD two years ago seemed to catch
the international mood. By appearing to ignore the shift to a less forgiving
economic climate, Mr Attali may find, however, that the spirit of the times
is moving against him. Practicalities, rather than vision, seem likely in
future to provide the EBRD's guiding force.

FT  24 APR 93 / Timex 'ready to settle' dispute at Dundee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIMEX, the US multinational company, is ready to settle the increasingly
bitter strike at its Dundee plant if the workers and their union - the AEEU
 -are willing to negotiate a Japanese-style agreement. This would include an
end to demarcation lines, and the introduction of total quality management,
multi-skilling and team working.
Timex is ready to talk to the union but will insist that it must guarantee -
and not just promise - a change in attitude at the plant that will enable
the company to reach profitability. The company will not accept any return
to business as usual.
In his first interview since the strike began, Mr John Dryfe, Timex's US
vice-president, said from the company's Connecticut headquarters: 'All we
want from the employees and the unions is an acceptance of the same
greenfield site conditions and attitudes at the Dundee plant that they are
happy to negotiate with any new foreign company which decides to invest in
Britain.
'We want to turn our operations in Dundee into a world-class manufacturing
facility and encourage our employees to participate in achieving this.'
He added: 'The company is saying 'let us co-operate together on solving the
problems of the 1990s, not go on fighting the battles of the 1920s and '30s.
The world has changed. We all have to adapt. Otherwise we are going to face
disaster.''
He added: 'Making circuit boards for electronic companies requires higher
concentration and discipline on the production lines.'
Since the dismissal of the 340 production workers at the lossmaking Dundee
plant 13 weeks ago, the company's US head office has kept a close watch on
events. The plant is continuing to produce circuit boards under contract for
the electronics industry with 210 replacement workers helped by office staff
and management.
Mr Dryfe said he regretted that the company had had to dismiss all its
original employees but he added that there had not been a master plan. 'It
was never our intention to sack all our employees but we were forced into
it,' he said.
'I believe we were left with no alternative if we wanted to keep the plant
in business. Underlying everything else is the fact that the sub-contracting
business is very competitive. We thought and still believe we were in danger
of losing our business customers and we would be left without a future,' he
added.
Mr Dryfe said that another reason for the company's decision was the
breakdown of trust between the company and local union officials: 'We saw no
willingness by local union officials to compromise.'
He added that Timex does not feel the same lack of trust towards union
officials at a higher level.
Within hours of what he claims was an agreement last February on layoffs, a
pay freeze and a cut in benefits, Mr Dryfe said he was surprised to find
that local union officials had rejected it. At two mass meetings the Timex
workers then threw out the deal but agreed to go back to work 'under
protest'.
Mr Dryfe said he did not know what this was supposed to mean: 'We could only
conclude if they came back they would immediately go out on strike again.'
He added: 'We warned the workers individually by letter they would be fired
if they did not accept all four points in the deal.'

FT  24 APR 93 / Lonrho negotiating to sell Observer to Independent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO, the international conglomerate, is in negotiations to sell the
Observer newspaper title to the owner of The Independent and its Sunday
stablemate.
Under the proposal being discussed, Lonrho would shoulder all the
multi-million-pound cost of closing the Observer. Founded in 1791, the
Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper.
A merger between The Independent and the Observer would create a strong
left-of-centre paper better able to challenge the dominance of the Sunday
Times.
The proposed deal envisages Lonrho taking a stake of between 15 to 20 per
cent in Newspaper Publishing, The Independent's owner. Lonrho would also
receive a sum of about Pounds 20m, deferred for up to 15 months, linked to
the performance of The Independent and The Independent on Sunday.
Mr Donald Trelford, editor of the Observer since 1975, insisted last night
there was 'no agreement to sell the Observer'. However, one of Lonrho's
financial advisers confirmed that the group was in talks with Newspaper
Publishing to sell the Observer title.
Although no formal decision has yet been taken by Lonrho to sell the paper,
bids were invited and received from both Newspaper Publishing and The
Guardian.
Because The Guardian is controlled by a charitable trust, it was unable to
offer a stake to Lonrho.
Any sale will have to be approved by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
and the Guardian interest could complicate the issue.
Any sale to Newspaper Publishing which would involve the closure of the
paper would be controversial given that The Guardian is keen to continue
publishing.
Mr Dieter Bock, Lonrho's biggest shareholder with 18.8 per cent and joint
chief executive with Mr Tiny Rowland, has made it clear that he wants to
sell the loss-making newspaper. Mr Rowland, who has effectively run Lonrho
for the past 31 years, has always blocked any possible sale of the Observer
and may try to do so again.
Lonrho bought the Observer in 1981. It is believed that Mr Rowland last
November vetoed a possible sale to The Guardian, which has long expressed an
interest in adding a national Sunday to its business. Mr Rowland has in the
past told friends that he would find any deal that would involve the closure
of the Observer 'profoundly distasteful'.
The newspaper's losses are now running at an annual rate of about Pounds 8m
compared with last year's deficit of Pounds 14.9m. But Mr Bock, after taking
his seat on Lonrho's board in Feburary, set up an internal team to work on
the sale of the paper.
If the sale goes through, it would suggest that Mr Rowland no longer
exercises unfettered power on the Lonrho board.
The Observer is printed by the Financial Times, under a contract which runs
to January 1995.

COCA-COLA, the Atlanta-based soft drinks manufacturer, appears to have
reached a deal with Fomento Economico Mexicana, under which the US group
will acquire a large minority stake in the Mexican company's soft drinks
division.
Coca-Cola has scheduled a press conference for Monday morning in Mexico.
Speculation last night suggested that details of the agreement would be
revealed then, although Coca-Cola itself declined to comment.
Femsa is Mexico's largest drinks company. Last month, it confirmed that
Coca-Cola was seeking to buy between 30 and 49 per cent of the soft drinks
division, which would then be spun off from Femsa and listed separately on
the Mexican stock market.
At that stage, Femsa and Coca-Cola were said to have reached agreement on a
business plan for the new company, but the price which the US group would
pay for its interest remained under negotiation.
Analysts have suggested that Coca-Cola could pay as much as Dollars 500m.

<TEXT>
A DATE for South Africa's first multi-racial election could be set within
six weeks, the chief government negotiator in democracy talks said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Cape Town.
But Mr Roelf Meyer also said four issues needed to be resolved first in
talks due to resume in Johannesburg on Monday. These were: the transition
process, the composition and powers of an interim government of national
unity, the powers of regional authorities during the transition, and ways to
contain political violence and control security forces.
Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, widely expected to emerge as the
largest party after democratic elections, has demanded early agreement on an
election date and on joint control of the security forces.
It has called for six weeks of mass protests across the country to press its
demands. Mr Meyer said President F W de Klerk had set an agenda similar to
the ANC's demands, but an election date could not be fixed until there was
agreement on the mechanisms for transition.

FT  24 APR 93 / Spare us the green shoots Mr Major: Because times are bad,
says Dominic Lawson, most of us have never had it so good
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS 25 months since I wrote the first of these columns, and history has
come full circle. Twenty-five months and three Budgets ago, we were being
told by Norman Lamont that there were signs of 'the green shoots' of growth
in the economy. As it turned out, the only view of green shoots then to be
obtained were from a position approximately six feet below. The British
economy was still well and truly buried.
Now, here we are, green shooting again, although this time John Major has
taken on the mantle of garden soothsayer from Lamont, who, understandably,
has abandoned the rustic rune business.
Speaking as a responsible citizen and loyal employee of an ambitious
organisation, I could not be more delighted that this time, as Chauncey
Gardner said in Being There, there will be growth in the spring. Speaking
personally, I am filled with gloom. For those of us who have kept our jobs
during the recession - and we represent the overwhelming majority of the
workforce - the bad times have been very good.
First, there was the wonderful disintegration of the retail price mechanism.
During the recession it was possible to haggle over the price of everything.
A friend of mine a few months ago, for a challenge, attempted to get
substantial reductions at the places one would least expect it. Asprey's,
Claridges, Harrods: they all succumbed. Apart from anything else, the haggle
was so enjoyable: it was like travelling to an exotic Middle eastern soukh
without all the inconveniences of foreign travel.
The economist Fred Hirsch, during the boom years of 1960s came up with a
clever concept, which he named 'the positional good.' As I recall, the less
one had to share something the more of a positional good it was. For
example, a place on an uncrowded beach was said to be worth much more than
the same place on the same beach, once it had become crowded.
During the boom of the 1980s we came to understand this as the 'German towel
on the beach' problem. In other words, if you accept Hirsch's concept, those
of us who are doing so-so are actually better off in a recession, because we
share the goodies with fewer people.
The list of this type of benefit is a long one: the availability of taxis at
all times and to all destinations , no matter how awkward; the ability to
get a table at a good restaurant without booking; the ability to park a car
in a City garage without queuing. Indeed, I do not think I have seen a queue
at all in London for at least three years.
There is another factor, which Hirsch did not write about: the joy at
others' misfortunes. The Germans call it schadenfreude. But it is a
particular hobby of the British. The sight of all those financial stars of
the 1980s plummeting to earth - or water, in the case of the late Robert
Maxwell - has been of enormous cheer to the British.
We were uncomfortable with the extraordinary access to great wealth of the
likes of Asil Nadir and Alan Bond, not because we thought their methods were
suspect - what could we have known of those? - but because such dynamic
growth in fortunes mocked our own innate aversion to risk, and our
sluggishness.
Worse still, during the growth years one experienced the ghastly shock of
meeting old school friends whom one had written off as irredeemably stupid,
and finding that they had made a great fortune in the City 'stripping
mortgages' or 'washing bonds', none of which one understood.
These people it seemed, were the only ones who could afford a property in
London with their own front door. Are these bad times to come again?
Property is the sorest point of all. It amazes me that the media and the
public seem to interpret the economy as 'bad' when house prices are falling
in real terms and 'good' when they are rising by more than the rate of
inflation. I dread newspaper headlines trumpetting estate agents' claims of
'healthy' rises in property prices, and I say this as someone with a heavily
mortgaged home. Like most people, other than the very old, I aspire to live
in a bigger house. The further property prices fall, the more likely it is
that I could afford such a home. And, just as I was planning such innocent
self-advancement, along comes the recovery. It's a crying shame.

   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOULDN'T it be splendid if John Major woke one morning in No 10 Downing
Street and found, pinned to his pillow or propped against his tea-maker, a
note from the Saint signed with the famous logo - a matchstick man with a
halo. The message would be quite short: 'I am watching you, sonnikins. Your
performance in office has been nothing but bloomers. Yet I believe you have
the makings of a decent man, so I am giving you a fresh start. That's all
I've got to say for now. Just raise your game considerably. The Saint is
watching you. Understand, honeybunch?'
Perhaps you didn't know that the Saint used words like 'sonnikins' and
'honeybunch' - or 'sweetness' or 'loveliness' - when admonishing villains?
Neither did I until this week, when news of the death of Leslie Charteris,
the Saint's creator, sent me scurrying to the bookshop to buy my first Saint
books: Enter the Saint, one of the earliest (published in 1930), and The
Saint Goes West (1942).
Their innocence is charming. How simple life was then. Right was right and
wrong was wrong, and sex was still in the cupboard. Even the violence the
Saint dished out was choreographed slapstick, at the end of which he was
liable to drawl, perhaps a little breathlessly: 'Any time any of you bad
cheeses want any more lessons in rough-housing, you've only got to drop me a
postcard and I'll be right along.'
In an introduction to the Everyman paperback version of Enter the Saint, Ion
Trewin says that it is possible, with hindsight, to see why the Saint caught
on so swiftly. With the depression at its height, Charteris offered not just
escapism but a contemporary Robin Hood who, like the Robin Hood of myth,
would hand over the loot - in the Saint's case to charity, keeping 10 per
cent as his fee.
In fact, analysis of the Saint books has shown that there were five Saints
all told, from the piratical and energetic Mark I Saint of the early books
to the final Mark V version: cosmopolitan and almost world-weary.
But he would be laughed off the bookstalls today. In Enter the Saint,
Charteris tells us that there was 'a certain quiet assurance about his
bearing, a certain steely quality that came sometimes into his blue eyes, a
certain indefinable air of strength and recklessness and quixotic bravado'
that reminded his opponents of 'wire and whipcord and indiarubber and
compressed steel springs and high explosives.'
Dearie-me, honeybunch. And the Saint's enemies were the crudest of cut-outs
 -'crooks, blood-suckers, traders in vice and damnation, and other verminous
excrescences of that type.'
There is little indication that the Saint would survive more than about
three minutes in a late 20th-century world echoing with the rumble of
apocalyptic prophesy. The Branch Davidians were not alone. In the US, as
many as 600 groups and individuals are currently proclaiming the onset of
global catastrophe, according to the Millennium Watch Institute in
Philadelphia, which monitors such predictions.
Ted Daniels, who runs the institute, attributes this doom-saying to the
approach of the year 2000. 'I think that's getting people excited. It seems
to follow in people's minds that there ought to be some huge change. All
those zeros pop up on the odometer and it's got to mean something.'
Yet the Saint books have set me thinking. Their escapism is no mere
accident. It is cleverly contrived. Because of the conventions of their
time, the view of the world they present is the result of determined and
skilful filtering, and of vigorous self-censorship. Leslie Charteris was not
an innocent. He knew a lot about the real world. But you can hardly tell
that from the books.
Quite soon - I predict - escapism and censorship will make a big comeback.
The planet is spinning towards so much horror that people will feel the need
to be protected from it, if only to preserve their sanity. They will want
newspapers and TV stations that offer them a sanctuary - a non-stop
merry-go-round of music, comedy, sport, sex, fashion, gardening, food and
wine tips, happy stories from safe places, medical breakthroughs, strange
objects in space, Princess Diana, religious visitations and the latest
speculation about particle physics and parallel universes.
They can sign me up tomorrow.

FT  24 APR 93 / Private View: A talk on the night train - Natalia Makarova,
the ballerina, trembles for the future of Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHE ALIGHTED like a gorgeous butterfly on the shining parquet of Prince
Naryshkin's palace in St Petersburg and took a swig of champagne. Her head
was wrapped in a trailing turban, her slender body in a jacket of rainbow
colours and her legs - the famous legs - in saucy black-patterned stockings.
When Natalia Makarova emerges fragile and shimmering from the secret
struggles of the wardrobe she seems to create an auditorium of the space
around her.
It is not deliberate vanity, I think, but her uninhibited theatricality  -
the same impulse that keeps the former prima ballerina assoluta of the Kirov
still twirling under the lights as an actress and media celebrity.
A few evenings later, aboard a luxury train trundling down to Volgograd and
central Asia, the Russian butterfly consented to perch for an hour in the
ornate library car and talk about the sensation of revisiting her wasted
homeland.
It was early in April and the snow was melting to expose a dour landscape of
birch woods, brown pasture and muddy, derelict townships. President Boris
Yeltsin had just returned from his meeting with Bill Clinton and was
campaigning for votes in the national referendum to be held tomorrow.
First of all I asked Makarova (the stress is on the second syllable) whether
anything of the Leningrad child in her had survived.
'Well, I don't feel particularly Russian,' she said in a heavy Russian
accent. 'Everybody says I'm totally Russian. But I don't feel this national
belonging. I belong to the world.' She laughed as if to apologise for the
conceit. 'I always am comfortable and feel free when I have lots of
possibility for creative things. And that's my home.'
Makarova's material home is San Francisco where she lives with her third
husband, Edward Karkar, a tall, courteous Lebanese-American who sold his
electronics company in 1986 and plays Stradivarius and Guarneri violins.
There are apartments in New York and London. The couple have a 15-year-old
son, Andrei ('Andrusha') who was travelling with them for his first look at
Russia.
Do you suffer as other exiles have? I asked. Solzhenitsyn became quite
bitter about the West . . .
'I know, I know. But you see writers are different. Writers belong to the
roots because they reflect their nation and they have probably more
responsibility to the nation. Ballet is a much more abstract art . . .
Because I am abstract. I am Sylphide (the wood sprite in Bournonville's
romantic ballet). I can be Sylphide everywhere. Nothing to do with politics.
It's my spirit, that's what it is . . . whether in America, Africa.
Everywhere it's a spirituality.'
This little sprite - she is no more than 5ft 3in tall - was rescued by her
mother from the German siege of Leningrad and grew up pardonably unashamed
of her material cravings - for chocolate, clothes and shoes, for icons and
works of art.
She is not all Material Girl. In the garden of their country house in the
Napa Valley, California, Makarova and her husband are completing an Orthodox
chapel of Canadian cedarwood with seven onion domes, computer-designed, of
copper-covered fibreglass. It is more than just a souvenir of the country
she fled 23 years ago, as became clear later in the conversation.
The couple have also set up a foundation to help her childhood ballet school
in St Petersburg, the Vaganova, which produced many of the great names of
Russian ballet including Makarova's two fellow refugees, Nureyev and
Baryshnikov.
Makarova defected ('I don't like the word. I choose to live in another
country]') during a Kirov tour to London. Dining with English friends, she
debated with them for seven hours before ringing Scotland Yard. 'They
predict me in Soviet Russia I will never survive,' she said, 'because I am
too Russian and I will be lost in that rotten capitalist world. But that is
old story.'
Four years ago, one of the first beneficiaries of glasnost, she returned to
her home city to dance at the Kirov. She decided to make it her swan-song as
a classical ballerina. Emotional as the occasion was, it seemed to her
unreal. 'I totally cancelled that other world when I live this different
life. In my mind I knew I will never go back. I just totally cut it from my
life.'
Would you live here again?
'No, I will not. Why? Why?'
I could not think why. To give people encouragement? To show your faith in
their future?
'I don't think it will be enough for them,' she laughed thinly. 'It will not
help, really. It's very romantic.' (I think she meant naive).
Do you feel no nostalgia?
'You can't say it's nostalgia. I just feel very sad and very dramatic
towards my generation, my people. I share with them and I suffer. It's not
just to say that. I really truly do. I really feel terrible because they
don't deserve that. They have a dignity and it looks like they're on the
edge to lose their dignity. I don't know what best I can do.
'They are down, much down. They hardly hope for the future. It's so sad.
Everyone complain. They took my shoulder and put their head on my shoulder
and say: 'Natashinka, but you heard about our situation?' I said: 'Of course
I heard'. It's getting worse and worse. At least after the war it was
difficult time but everyone was optimistic, rebuilding, you know, a
rejuvenation mood. But now they find hard just to survive to get enough
food, not to die.'
As Makarova's passion rises, her accent and syntax becomes ever more exotic.
She begged me, for the sake of her career as an actress, to tidy up her
English. What can one do? It is part of her personality, and the critics are
forgiving because of her mesmerising stage presence. The Financial Times
called her the most flawed but the most sublime element of the piece when
she starred opposite Robert Powell in Tovarich in Chichester and London. Her
performance in On Your Toes won her rave reviews and an Olivier award as
best acress in a musical.
When I observed it was difficult not to feel ashamed travelling in luxury
through such manifest poverty, she agreed hastily.
'Yes. I feel guilty. Me too. Absolutely. I go to the streets with these
people. They cover themselves and they look away from the camera. It is
because they have dignity that they cover. And I am living well, I'm
alright. I am really like a Scarlett O'Hara.'
She described her compatriots as spiritually energetic but reduced to apathy
by 'the tragedy of uncertainty where the old thing collapses and the new
didn't arrive.' If they got through the mental and moral stress of the
present, she added, they would survive.
She talked about Africa and Yugoslavia in the same breath as Russia. 'I wish
everyone would not just say 'Oh, Oh, how bad]' but do something realistic
about it. I just wish people will be not passive. Of course you can
sympathise with people who are hungry but do something. My God]
'Just put this. How is principles, when people are dying? How possible
that?'
The extravagance of her language does not mean Makarova's concern is
insincere. Indeed, as we talked a softer, more thoughtful and less
theatrical character began to emerge and her discomfort with my questions
subsided.
I wondered how maturity had changed her. We get older, I said, and want to
make sense of our lives. Like Tolstoy, I prompted.
'Certainly. And sometimes they are wrong.'
What about you?
'You perform some role and you are very fussy at the beginning,' she
replied. 'With more experience you cut the extra and come to the essence. So
probably with age you come to be more simple, more direct.'
What about the celebrity status you have achieved as a dancer and exile, and
now as a media performer. Do you enjoy that side of life?
'I don't think about that. It's part of my life. I cannot answer. It's just
what I am.'
Some people in the public eye complain . . .
'No, I don't dislike anything. I don't particularly like socialising when I
am out of work. I prefer to stay in my country house and read and listen to
music. That's the most enjoyable time I have. I had very little opportunity
before.'
I asked her what she read. She surprised me by replying promptly:
'Philosophy, religion.'
Did you have any religious teaching?
'Not as a child, no. Only my babushka, my grandmother, christened me when I
was five years old and since that I never was in church in Russia.'
A little later she said: 'Myself, I have a belief. But it is in me, inside
of me. It's not come from on top. I am afraid now in Russia there is a new
fashion of religion which comes too much from above. It is somehow strange
to me after all this education in the party ideology. They have gone from
one extreme to another.'
Because they feel so vulnerable?
'Probably escapism too. I read a lot of philosophers, atheist and religious,
like Berdyaev, like Heidegger, Camus and Sartre. I compare and choose for
myself. I am looking for the right thing for me.
'I don't think ever in the history of Russia they ever had a choice. It's
always been dictated - how to think, how to feel. Thus for people to take
liberty and democracy is very difficult, mentally. There has to be a
transition time. It will be much longer than you think.' She looked at me
accusingly.
You mean 50 years, 100 years?
'I can't predict. I am not politician. I am not gypsy,' she laughed gaily
and continued. 'I'm not very political, as you say. Not very intellectual.'
She laughed again. 'So. I'm not supposed to be. I'm ballerina.' And she
flitted off to bed.

FT  24 APR 93 / Arts: Dramatic passions - Malcolm Rutherford reviews 'Don't
Fool with Love'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNLESS I have missed it, there is no English equivalent of Alfred de
Musset's On ne badine pas avec l'amour. Here is real romantic drama, full of
pulsating passions and pulsating breasts. The English might go in for that
sort of thing in novels, but not on stage. Yet the great surprise of the
Cheek by Jowl production at the Donmar Warehouse is that it works.
Declan Donnellan's English version is not significantly different from an
old, yellowing version I picked up in the local library, except in one
respect. The earlier translation was called No Trifling with Love. Donnellan
has switched to the sharper Don't Fool with Love. Thus he catches the
mixture of the reckless and the imperative that is at the heart of the play.
The piece is close to Musset's life. He was the lover of George Sand, who
abandoned him first for his Italian doctor, then for Chopin. Rather like
Proust's Remembrance of Things Past, the genders have been mixed up in the
telling. There may a bit of George Sand in the heroine Camille, but there
seems to be even more of her in the male lover Perdican. Anyway, what you
have is an ultimately tragic affair between two capricious people. There is
also a wholly innocent victim in the country girl Rosette whom Perdican woos
when he is too proud to stick to Camille. It is Rosette who dies in the end.
Donnellan directs himself. Not once does he go over the top. The lovers are
young and fresh. They speak their lines as if they are feeling the emotions
for the first time. Camille, played by Maria Miles, is only 18 and about to
enter a nunnery. Inevitably she reminds one of Heloise in the famous story.
What strikes most, however, is her commanding presence throughout. She, too,
is proud.
Perdican, played by Michael Sheen, is an experienced lover, but in the
physical not the romantic sense of the term. At times Sheen fairly bubbles
with enthusiasm and a sense of wonder that he can be experiencing such
feelings, yet the pride never leaves him. Rosette kills herself (or maybe
just dies) behind the altar while she hears him swearing his love to Camille
in the oratory. The marriage will not take place.
The romance is not all. There is some rather jolly knockabout in the chateau
of Perdican's father, the baron. A drunken tutor and the local priest
compete for baronial attention, a share of the wine and a place in the
pecking order at table. That is the light relief. It contributes to a
splendid whole. The baron is a thoroughly self-confident figure played by
Colin McFarlane who plainly has no idea of the passions that are seething
around him.
Don't Fool with Love is performed on a plain round stage designed by Nick
Ormerod. There are no accessories; none are needed. The set looks much
bigger than it is, which is how it should be.
Mistakenly, I think, the piece is preceded by The Blind Men, a 20 minute
work by the Belgian writer Michel de Ghelderode (1898-1962). It concerns
three blind men trying to walk from Flanders to Rome and going round in
circles. There is no comment to make except that it is very well acted.
Musset can stand on his own.

FT  24 APR 93 / Arts: Slice of vagrant life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST OF us know too little about the two most crucial decades of British
history: 1640-60. Any play from that era that gives us a fresh insight into
that era is welcome, and Richard Brome's A Jovial Crew (1641), currently
presented by the RSC in Stephen Jeffreys' adaptation, is - as a slice of
history onstage - an amazement. It is about a troupe (and, by implication,
troupes) of vagrants, who beg and perform to win their daily bread, who roam
to escape conformism and to discover truth, and who seek to realise Utopia
in England; and its central characters are young gentryfolk who take off and
join the vagrant life.
The play is a serious comedy, occasionally larded with juicy caricature and
farce. But watching Jeffreys' version is an uneasy experience, especially if
you are not one of those rare birds who have swotted up on the original. On
the one hand, has Jeffreys, in 'improving' what was surely no masterpiece in
the first place, hotted up the play's socio-political content? I am curious
less on account of purism than because, to me the play's main interest is
what it tells me about 1641. On the other, if Jeffreys simply wanted to make
A Jovial Crew a better show, why has he not pruned it more? Three hours and
a quarter is at least half an hour too long.
The jovial crew, in Max Stafford-Clark's staging, could be a heap more
jovial. Their biggest song-and-dance number features some very interestingly
fierce choreography by Sue Lefton, in which the performers work themselves
up to fever pitch, losing self-control as if in some 17th-century British
Rite of Spring. This was fascinating and impressive, but did not fit into
Brome's play.
These problems apart, this is a powerful production. The beggars' life
becomes vivid, serious, at times alarming (the women encounter attempted
rape), at times hilarious (as when these new beggars beg in over-educated
language). When the play reaches its happy ending, some characters choose to
remain wanderers; and their words - 'I've a journey yet to go' - clearly
echo Kent's dark words at the end of King Lear. Amid a lively and
well-integrated ensemble, Ron Cook as the steward turned vagrant Springlove
gives an exemplary performance: sombre, generous, wry, alert.
In repertory at the Pit, Barbican Centre

FT  24 APR 93 / Arts: A royal feast of Canalettos - Susan Moore reviews the
exhibition at the Queen's Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HORACE Walpole disparagingly referred to Joseph Smith as 'the merchant of
Venice'. It is a soubriquet that fails to do justice to a singular
personality who combined the talents of banker and British Consul,
bibliophile and publisher, art agent and collector. He amassed the finest
array of Canalettos ever and it is our good fortune that he sold it - along
with other outstanding paintings, manuscripts, drawings and prints - to the
young George III.
A King's Purchase: King George III and the Collection of Consul Smith is the
latest of the year-long exhibition at the Queen's Gallery devoted to various
aspects of the Royal Collection. A less ambitious affair than last year's
impressive evocation of the Prince Regent's Carlton House, it is the return
home of a selection of Consul Smith's Italian Old Master drawings after an
international tour, adapted and extended in form. No new research is
offered, and no picture is unveiled for the first time. Yet these morsels
constitute a rare feast. A wall or two of 13 out of some 50 Canaletto oils;
a Bellini portrait and a Vermeer make for exceptional amuse gueules.
It appears to have been the books and manuscripts rather than the works of
art that primarily interested both Consul and King. Smith was a
knowledgeable collector-cum-dealer, particularly of incunabula, and by the
time of his death in 1770 he had amassed a second and no less important
collection which sold in nearly 2,000 lots. As founder of the Pasquali Press
in Venice, he promoted the engraver's art and also championed the
architecture of Palladio, publishing the Quattro Libri in a fine fascimilie
edition.
Almost as a sideline, he became the agent for Canaletto. Since the opening
years of the century He had acted as middleman for British collectors of
works of art as well as books and manuscripts, but his relationship with
Canaletto developed into that of a modern-day dealer with virtually all of
Canaletto's output going directly to him. Their association appears to have
begun in the late 1720s when Smith commissioned six large views of the
Piazza and Piazetta of S. Marco, possibly to be let into the panelling of
his palazzo near the Rialto. Within a decade he was supplying Woburn with
its series of 22 small and two large canvases, and his publication of the
artist's views of the Grand Canal was drumming up further commissions from
home.
Anyone who has a jaded view of Canaletto after seeing too many of the late
productions of master and workshop should hurry to the Queen's Gallery to
refresh their opinion in the face of Canaletto at his most beguiling. Here
are two of the five large upright views of the ancient sites of Rome, again
probably intended for Smith's palazzo. The clarity of light is breathtaking,
and the fluidity of his paint and the liveliness of his touch as he boldly
fleshes out his unusually large figures are as vivacious as anything by
Tiepolo.
Two views of the slate-grey Thames - from the terrace at Somerset House
looking towards Westminster and upstream towards St Paul's and a skyline
pierced by slender church spires - offer contrasting vignettes of
contemporary London life. Yet even these delightful confections look almost
dour beside his sparkling view of the Bacino di S. Marco on Ascension Day.
There is nothing crabbed or dry about this Canaletto.
Consul Smith's is the sole surviving great 18th century Venetian collection.
As well as patronising Canaletto, he had acquired most of the best works by
the older Sebastiano Ricci and his vast and Veronese-inspired 'Adoration of
the Magi' dominates the exhibition space, as is perhaps appropriate for a
gallery that began life as a private chapel. The slight, high-key gouaches
painted on leather by Ricci's nephew and collaborator Marco - including the
delightful 'Courtyard of a Villa' - are minor masterpieces. They, like the
late self-portrait of Smith's friend, the Venetian pastellist Rosalba
Carriera - broken veins and all - could easily be overlooked on the way out.
Smith bought haphazardly, as and when the opportunity arose. One inspired
acquisition was the collection of Zaccaria Sagredo in 1752. It brought the
Royal Collection the Bellini plus several volumes of Old Master drawings -
scantily represented here by Raphael's red chalk 'Massacre of the Innocents'
and two sheets (out of an unparalleled group of 200) by Castiglione, drawn
with customary bravura in oil paint with the point of a brush. The great
surprise is the cache of Dutch and Flemish pictures that Smith acquired when
he purchased the collection of GA Pellegrini, an artist who had worked
extensively in Northern Europe.
The overall uneveness of Smith's collection is typical of the period. Many
paintings were not what they purported to be, including all the Titians and
Veroneses. Other misattributions proved more serendipitous. One picture from
the Pellegrini estate was listed as by Frans Van Mieris and described as 'A
Woman playing on a Spinnet in presence of a Man seems to be her father'.
Only in the mid-19th century did it come to be revered as a work of the
newly rediscovered master, Johannes Vermeer.
A King's Purchase continues at the Queen's Gallery, Buckingham Palace, until
December 23

FT  24 APR 93 / Arts: Pianist on the podium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMONGST pre-eminent conductors on the scene, there are usually two or three
who like to strut their paces at the keyboard, once in a blue moon: Szell
and Sawallisch spring to mind. Very often, in suitably chosen works - they
avoid music that requires the ultimate virtuoso polish - their pianism is as
satisfying as their conducting. Since the 1960s, however, there has been a
surge of first-class pianists crossing over in the other direction, which
some of us have found less heartening.
It is one thing for a master-pianist to render his most penetrating insights
into his own instrument's sound, but quite another to transmit his full
intentions to fellow-musicians in concert; or again, to play upon their
collective voice so that it actually speaks and thrills. Those are not a
pianist's natural knacks. Bluntly: who will claim (hand on heart]) to have
heard an orchestral performance under Barenboim or Ashkenazy that came near
to matching their most inspired solo playing?
On the evidence of his Festival Hall debut with the Philharmonia on
Thursday, Mikhail Pletnev may prove an exception. He is already known here
as a pianist of formidable powers; and, not incidentally, as one who has
also been happy to appear as accompanist - 'mere' would not be the word -
for Michael Collins' superlative clarinet. Meanwhile, at his other home in
Moscow, he has founded and developed an independent 'Russian National
Orchestra' of contract players.
For Pletnev's first appearance on a London podium he had Collins as soloist
on basset-clarinet, the historical lower instrument for which Mozart
originally planned his very late Clarinet Concerto (published in a version
with higher substitutes for the lowest solo passages). With flawlessly
sympathetic Philharmonia support, Collins made the darker-toned instrument
sound like no period curiosity, but the native voice of the concerto. Its
dusky resonance seemed ideal, both for unshowy but pungent 'accompanying'
passages and for intimate ruminations at centre stage.
Before that we had Weber's Oberon Overture, a familiar hors-d'oeuvre which
rarely gets the quick, tender attention that Pletnev gave it. Properly
open-air horns, a firecracker start for the 'Allegro con fuoco', all the
eager, transparent innocence the piece prescribes: that bespoke practical
expertise, not just good musical intentions. Later, Chaikovsky's
'Pathetique' Symphony stretched him further, and found nothing wanting.
Its initial Adagio/Allegro - both tempi read at bold extremes - was vitally
alert and dramatic. The 5/4 'waltz' movement really danced, with a baleful
glint, and the Scherzo-March was a brilliantly headlong affair, exciting
beyond the routine norm; the final Adagio lamentoso rose to precise,
poignant expression without resorting to howls or swoops. If Pletnev were
unknown as a pianist, this performance would still have earned him
full-blooded credentials as a conductor of notable gifts.

<TEXT>
ON ST George's Day yesterday there was little celebration: a couple of
references on Radio 2, but at least Radio 4's Thought for the Day was given
by Dr English.
David Wheeler's Farewell, Fleet Street (Radio 4, Sunday) had a Radio Times
picture of Lord Northcliffe wearing an inexplicable American flag. We had
pictures of Northcliffe in our home when I was a boy; he was practically my
father's patron saint, and I got his Christian name. All in this feature
spoke well of him, inventor of the popular paper - the Daily Mail and later
the Daily Mirror. The First World War brought him influence with Lloyd
George, until as Prime Minister Lloyd George cut himself off from the Press.
By this time Northcliffe had bought The Times, but later he began to go off
his head - cardiac trouble, they said. His brother, the first Lord
Rothermere, took over, but he was a manager rather than a journalist,
besides being, says Lord Cudlipp, 'preposterously stupid'. He was stupid
enough to back Mussolini and the British blackshirts - and a rival appeared
in the field, Max Aitken, later Lord Beaverbrook, of the Daily Express and
the Evening Standard. A great journalist, he too could be stupid. He
inaugurated the Empire Crusade; he insisted in the 1930s there would be no
war; and when there was, there would be no rationing. In the War Cabinet he
did much for the aircraft industry. John Junor and others spoke of him with
respect and affection.
Murdoch and Maxwell were mentioned only transiently, but this was just the
first programme of four. More time was given to Andreas Whittam-Smith,
prompted into launching the Independent by hearing that Eddie Shah was to
start a national daily; and to the individual style of the Guardian. The
series will be worth following.
The centenary of Joan Miro, the Spanish painter, was celebrated on Radio 3
both on Friday, with Poems of Erath and Ether, a biographical sketch by
Richard Calvocoresi, and on Tuesday, in Mirooo, an 'exploration in sound and
music' of his Harlequin's Carnaval that left me cold. Miro was from
Barcelona but went to Paris in 1920. His style was called the
'mythification' of the natural phenomena that excited him. He made
preliminary drawings for his paintings, but his ideas 'ripened in his mind'.
Wrongly labelled surrealist, he was not really of them. His work was 'not
abstract but accessible'; many may have seen it in the Spanish pavilion at
the Barcelona Olympics. He was, it was decided, 'the greatest public artist
of the last half-century'. I hope Tuesday's programme did not deter
listeners from the greater fascinations of Friday's. Neither of them, of
course, gave much idea to those who have not seen them how Miro's paintings
look. Radio's great, sad weakness is its pictorial inadequacy. Last Saturday
Kaleidoscope on Radio 4 had an interesting half-hour, The Ballerina: a
Swansong, about the fading of the ideal ballerina of tradition. Great
dancers like Markova and Baronova told how dancers today lacked the needful
inner belief in what they were doing. They must 'sing in their guts' the
music to which they dance; virtuosity for its own sake 'is not art, it is a
circus.' Clement Crisp and photographer Anthony Crickmay, long-standing
commentators on the dance, were with them.
But plasticity, harmony, musicality - no dialogue, no music even, can
explain to the listener how these qualities may be seen more in one dancer
than another. Radio can pass such things on; but the most elaborate
stereophony cannot bring them to life in the home. You have to see them - on
a screen if necessary, but see them.

FT  24 APR 93 / Books: Dangerous obsession - Fiction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ISABEL QUIGLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POET AND DANCER by Ruth Prava Jhabvala John Murray Pounds 14.99, 199 pages
BREACH CANDY by Luke Jennings Hutchinson Pounds 14.99, 254 pages
CLEOPATRA'S SISTER by Penelope Lively Viking Pounds 14.99, 282 pages
WRITERS are often offered stories by strangers. When Ruth Prava Jhabvala is
asked by a distraught old woman to write her daughter Angel's story, she is
dubious but not surprised; though she knows too little about the girl to
make a biography possible, and there are few papers, letters or tangible
remains.
I am not sure that the mixture of fact in this prologue and fiction in the
rest is needed. A novel without pretence of factual authenticity seems
perfectly in order and indeed one plunges into it with immediate belief and
commitment. It deals with love as obsession, in human terms as madness: the
total devotion of saint to sinner, of innocence to depravity. Angel and
Lara, first cousins, are as diverse as two people can be. To say that Angel
is plain and good, Lara electrifyingly attractive and bad, is too
simplistic. Lara is not just capricious, promiscuous, impossible, but sick,
identifiably mad.
Beside that, Angel's mystical sense of Lara's importance is an 'absolute'
emotion, making a relationship like that between worshipper and deity. Angel
sacrifices everything for Lara - her own beloved mother, her close friend,
her way of life, finally life itself. The story is told with great clarity,
beauty and strength; it echoes much else, means more than it says, has
resonances which have something, but not everything to do with style. It
shows Ruth Prava Jhabvala at her peak.
Breach Candy is a first novel full of zip and promise. Two narrators
alternate in telling their parallel tales: June, a ballet dancer and
Stanley, a director of television programmes, both, after burning their
professional boats in England, have landed in Bombay, neither knowing quite
which new way to take. In the Nepean Sea Bathing Club for ex-pats they meet,
become friends, exchange confidences, talk of things never told before. He,
of how he left his world at the age of seven, when his parents were killed
in an accident; she, of how she failed on the night she was given her first
starring role in ballet and never got a second chance. He tells, too, how
the girl he loved betrayed him: is physical betrayal which doesn't mean
much, worse than unphysical infidelity which does? As they say on exam
papers, discuss.
The future of fiction seems in good hands when a first novel packs so much
in and at the same time leaves plenty over. There is fizzy dialogue, varied
and sharp; an ear for English as spoken by Indians, not at all Peter
Sellers-style; a powerful sense of weather, heat, physicality; an intimate
knowledge of ballet and how things are done in it, an equal familiarity with
India. The ending seems abrupt, but never mind. Much more must lie ahead.
Strangers thrown together in stress or danger is a favourite fictional
device, heightening feeling, speeding up relationships, magnifying
everything; there are plenty of models. Hostages after a forced landing is
the obvious present-day example. In Penelope Lively's Cleopatra's Sister
they are seized in a Middle Eastern country where a Gadaffi-like dictator
has just taken power. His enemies, having fled to Britain, he grabs the
British passengers on a flight to Nairobi. Swap my enemies for them, he
tells the British government. In the mounting horror and occasional
hysteria, two people fall in love, and their subterranean happiness in spite
of all the rest is credibly put across. The modern capital city, where
Cleopatra's sister is said to have ruled, is gruesomely vivid, and its
regime of capricious terror seems sinisterly familiar.

FT  24 APR 93 / Arts: The RA'S white knight steps down - Simon Tait talks to
Roger de Grey, 75 this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIS name makes him sound like a knight in Murder in the Cathedra1, ritually
hacking away at the Becket metaphor for innovation and change, but Sir Roger
de Grey is not that. On the contrary, he is a modern-minded traditionalist
who abhors conflict.
This week he was 75 and, according to the rules of the Royal Academy of Arts
of which he has been president since 1984, he must retire in December.
According to Tom Phillips, who could succeed him, he has completed the
institution's transition from a gentleman's club for old artists to one of
the worlds' great exhibition centres and brought to the membership a
contemporary relevance missing for at least a century.
De Grey has won over the likes of Hockney and Kitaj, who had thought the
place an irrelevance; he has encouraged innovators like Peter Blake; and he
has invited non-members to exhibit. He abolished the Associateship, an
apprenticeship which many accomplished artists found offensive. He probably
saved the place from closure; and he certainly preserved one of the
Academy's founding pillars, the Summer Exhibition, and restored the
reputation of the other, the Academy Schools.
De Grey looks anything but the sinister eminence grise his name conjures: a
slight figure clad in jacket, slacks, button-down shirt and knitted silk tie
in colours reminiscent of the gentle French Cezannesque landscapes he
paints. He is a doughty combatant for his students, and will continue as
principal of the City and Guilds art school.
The history of the Academy is full of schisms, rows and cabals. Constable
and Gainsborough both withdrew from the Summer Exhibition; Spencer, Sickert
and John all resigned; and in 1990 Caro refused to join. The biggest
presidential row was in 1949, caused by Alfred Munnings's refusal to accept
that Picasso, Matisse and Moore were worth consideration.
Tom Monnington's ten-year presidency which ended in 1976 began the
rehabilitation which was continued by the ebullient Hugh Casson. But Casson
was an architect, and it needed a painter to bring the painters across. For
20 years de Grey had taught at the Royal College of Art, and was part of the
RCA underground in the 1950s and '60s which wanted to reform the Academy.
Treasurer throughout Casson's presidency, there was no surprise when he was
elected on Casson's retirement. Still, he did not really want to be
president. 'I'd never had a job where I had to be a public figure, and this
was a job in which you had to be one. If you couldn't become one you'd
failed. I said 'I'm not a speaker, I'll just say what I think', and I did.
Sometimes it works.'
The principal anxiety was how to keep the Academy open all year, and his
solution has been his single most visible contribution - the Sackler
Galleries. The Royal Academy has no grant and its loan exhibitions were
becoming its main source of income. But owners of important pictures were
increasingly conservation conscious, and by 1988 the state of the air
conditioning in the galleries was putting them off.
The rarely used Diploma Galleries were the obvious place to start and he
launched the academy into a massive Pounds l0 million scheme to join the
RA's two separate buildings together, nullify the Victorian incursions and
introduce modern atmospheric controls, display space and access in architect
Norman Foster's prize-winning design. De Grey got sponsorship after chatting
to the millionaire Arthur Sackler on a bus between New York and
Philadelphia.
There was not universal approval, but winning this year's RlBA architecture
award was a vindication and there is a new appeal for Pounds 7.8m to update
the main galleries.
There is plenty of ritual at the RA, not least with the selection of the
Summer Exhibition which has just begun. De Grey saved the Summer Exhibition,
which by 1977 had become a financial liability, by pushing through
commission, 15 per cent at first and now up to 30 per cent, which provided
essential income.
But some RAs want the Summer Exhibition abandoned and replaced by an RAs'
show because they are worried about their work getting lost among the 1,200
other works submitted; de Grey suggested having one alongside the Summer
Show, a notion which threatened to become divisive and was dropped. Now
Allen Jones has raised it again.
That they can rationally discuss setting aside for the good of the art an
institution enjoyed by upwards of 120,000 people each year, even
temporarily, is owed to the white knight chairing the round table. 'Roger de
Grey is simply the best president this century' said Tom Phillips.

FT  24 APR 93 / Books: The art of success - The 35th anniversary of T&amp;H's
'World of Art' series
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RARELY does an independent British publisher get to celebrate longevity
these days; so many have been swallowed by larger competitors. It is even
more unusual for a publisher to undertake a promotion not simply designed to
sell more of its books but which also hopes to prod the general public into
an appreciation of the visual arts, design and architecture.
But Thames and Hudson's World of Art series is 35 years old this year, and
its promotion on May 1 is quite exceptional. The distinctive black paperback
collection of more than 130 titles, which eclectically stretches from
Abstract Expressionism to Women, Art and Society is proof that commerce can
still be both intelligent and successful.
To commemorate its 35th anniversary, T&amp;H, as everyone knows it, is running a
UK-wide World of Art day on Saturday May 1 when visitors to galleries and
museums in Belfast, Cambridge, Glasgow, Liverpool, London, Oxford and
elsewhere can get two entrance tickets for the price of one.
The only requirement is to carry a copy of a T&amp;H World of Art book, new or
old. Visitors to galleries and museums which do not charge entrance fees
will be able to get discounts on selected items in the gallery shops
concerned.
T&amp;H will be donating a percentage from sales of its World of Art books to
three charities (two art charities and Greenpeace, the latter because of
T&amp;H's dolphin logo) between April 19 and May 3. T&amp;H will spending in the
region of Pounds 50,000 on the promotion. UK and overseas turnover this year
will reach about Pounds 16m in wholesale prices for the company as a whole.
T&amp;H started life in 1949, established by Walter Neurath, an Austrian who
fled Nazi-controlled Vienna and arrived in London in 1938, and his second
wife Eva, who remains chairman. Neurath's Fabian-socialist leanings inclined
him towards producing high-quality art books at prices within the reach of
the general public. He published English Cathedrals, T&amp;H's first
English-originated book, in 1950. Far in advance of current 'New Age'
vogues, T&amp;H's list has since its inception been shown interest in exploring
not just classical fine arts but also more esoteric visual arts, mythology
and what Thomas Neurath - Walter's son and currently managing director of
T&amp;H - calls 'archetypal psychology'.
Among its earliest series was Myth and Man, about the Homeric gods and
Celtic mythology. The new publications for 1993's World of Art series
include Aboriginal Art, Buddhist Art and Architecture and Latin American Art
of the 20th Century. More than 23m World of Art books, in 16 languages, have
been sold since the series began.
T&amp;H has prospered since first established. Thomas Neurath says that T&amp;H's
relatively small scale is a 'very viable model for publishers to stick
with.' The company is guarded from death duty erosions of its independence
by its family trust status. Moreover, T&amp;H regularly makes the top-ten list
of booksellers' favourite publishers, because the company has an enviable
reputation for sticking to its promises, delivery times and payments, all
basic business practices, towards which larger publishers sometimes take a
rather more cavalier approach.
That reputation secures a welcome in other markets. T&amp;H has set up a joint
venture with a Spanish publisher; it co-publishes with companies in Italy,
and Germany; it runs its own companies in Australia, France and the US, and
has links with Japanese publishers.
The World of Art series is priced very competitively, at Pounds 6.95 a
paperback, for books crammed with black-and-white and colour illustrations.
Given that an ordinary unillustrated paperback can cost rather more than
that, isn't T&amp;H failing to maximise potential profits? Not necessarily, and
Thomas Neurath demurs at the suggestion that T&amp;H is philanthropically
inclined. The economics of the World of Art series require that a typical
first print-run will be about 30,000, quite substantial given that in the UK
today a hardback print-run for a first novel might be as little as 500.
T&amp;H has been hit recently by increased reproduction fees expected by museums
and galleries for publishing paintings and exhibits; the estate of Salvador
Dali gets a higher royalty for the World of Art book on Dali than does its
author. Neurath argues that 'even if you end up paying Pounds 250 for a
picture, once you spread it across a first print-run of 30,000 and then the
book goes on selling, it doesn't really cramp us hugely. The whole economics
is geared to volume.'
But with telescoping attention-spans the order of the day, is not Neurath
worried that the World of Art series, which requires a growing audience of
thoughtful readers, might be running against the tide of contemporary
culture?
'There are perhaps two streams operating. Not everyone is playing Nintendo
games. Perhaps it is a sort of compensation. Short attention span activities
are fulfilling up to a point. Eventually people realise that a wider view
and a more sustained level of interest may be more important.'
The World of Art series has become synonymous with well-written, informative
and admirably illustrated guides to the finest of art and artists. 'The aim
we have is to get people who know their subject and can write clearly and in
a manner which is free from jargon . . . it's a very affordable and
straightforward way of absorbing knowledge. Inexpensive books, which are
accessible, open windows for people,' says Neurath.
How many publishers today speak of opening windows for people - and even put
their words into practice? That in itself is cause for celebration.

FT  24 APR 93 / Arts: Beyond the North Winds - Max Loppert hails Birmingham
Touring Opera's new production of Rameau's 'Les Boreades'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIG OPERATIC excitements are being unleashed in Birmingham. In five packed
years of existence City of Birmingham Touring Opera has established a
sharp-profiled artistic identity with its chamber-operatic versions of
Boheme, Flute, Falstaff and a two-part Ring-cycle abridgement, all by the
company's artistic director, Graham Vick. Now the company credo is being
tested to the limit with a Rameau opera - Les Boreades (1764), last in his
series of tragedies-lyriques, re-named Beyond the North Winds in Amanda
Holden's new translation.
The adventurousness of the undertaking needs to be underlined: this is no
boiled-down CBTO Boreades production but a full-strength affair, with a
21-person period-instrument orchestra, a chorus of 15 and a dance-troupe of
12. What is more, it proves to be - shaming fact] - the first full-length
Rameau opera production by any professional British opera company. Up to now
this composer has been given solely in concert performance, in the
pioneering 'historical' revivals of the English Bach Festival, and in
student stagings.
The small Birmingham company ventures lightfootedly where Covent Garden,
with its opera and ballet companies on call, has so far feared to tread.
There is, of course, a reason for such reluctance on the part of the big
companies: the demands of the tragedie-lyrique form for highly organised,
intricately interlaced patterns of song, dance and visual spectacle.
Rameau stage-works do not play themselves. Part of the boldness of this new
production comes, as it were, with the CBTO territory: a company whose
policy is to perform in out-of-the-way venues to audiences of multifarious
makeup must find a way of re-creating Les Boreades in terms of widely
appealing modern stagecraft. Vick and his production associates (designer
Paul Brown, choreographer Ron Howell) have managed this with enormous
imaginative daring and zest. The choice of Birmingham performing space is
itself an element in the risk-taking - the Mayfair Suite, an unused,
decaying reception hall in the city's central shopping mall, forms a
wonderfully louche, provocative backdrop to these fantasticated high-caste
rituals of the courtly French lyric theatre.
The tale of the re-discovery of the last Rameau opera has been told on this
page more than once. This latest episode in that tale is designed to
demonstrate in a new way what an astonishing piece of music-theatre it is.
In Les Boreades Rameau welded the minutiae of the tragedie-lyrique format
into longer spans of 'cumulative' music-drama than he had created before,
cutting across formal convention and dazzling the ear with melodic
inventions and instrumental combinations which further that dramatic
condensation process. The libretto (probably by Cahusac) offered him choice
opportunities for confronting opposed worlds of Greek mythology, decadent
Bactrian aristocrats versus noble followers of Apollo, and for posing an
heroic rescue quest as the central burden - at times the hieratic rites of
Mozart's Flute and the Romantic dramaturgy of Weber and Wagner seem only a
step away.
A square white platform, framed at the back with sliding panels and a raised
eyrie for the orchestra, with a revolve at its centre, forms here the
foundation of Vick's re-invented Ramellian music-drama. Tuxedos and
ball-gowns out of 1950s movie musicals clothe the Bactrians, saffron scarves
and linen baggies the Apollonians. The 'marvellous machines' of 18th-century
theatrical practice are supplied by sleight of hand and skilful (even if on
Wednesday prey to computer-board dysfunction) lighting.
In sum, this is pocket spectacle, worked up with impudent wit and keen
colour-contrast which nevertheless suggest an understanding of and sympathy
for the original. As yet it does not gel all the way through. Alastair
Macaulay will shortly be reviewing the dance elements; for myself, I found
the modern dance language sensitively forged - while the earlier dance
divertissements look cluttered and lacking in strong, spare dance imagery,
the finale is beautifully clean and joyful.
The disposition of orchestra and singers to widely separate levels, bravely
handled by all participants, puts a damper on rhythmic flair, that key
Rameau characteristic. Simon Halsey, the conductor, seems in any case to
favour a rather jogtrot-ish approach to tempo choice; in these spaces the
instrumental sound was too often dulled and out of tune. The main shortage,
I would suggest, is of vocal virtuosity: the CBTO cast are all capable young
singers, practised in a wide range of operatic styles, but note-for-note
precision of placing is in short supply, and verbal clarity is even scarcer
 -only Jonathan Best (Adamas and Boreas) and Peter Jeffes (Apollo) make
anything at all of the Holden translation.
All this said, the whole achievement is exhilarating. Debussy, a Rameau
appassionato, ended an appreciation of a 1903 Castor et Pollux revival with
an apology for doing so at such length - but 'moments of real joy in life
are rare'. Since this Boreades provides an abundance of those moments, I now
echo the Debussy apology.
CBTOpera at the Mayfair Suite, Birmingham this Saturday; then on tour to
Salisbury, Coventry, Nottingham and the Brighton Festival

FT  24 APR 93 / Arts: Dancing to independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DELICATELY, Birmingham Royal Ballet is beginning to detach itself from its
parent at the Royal Opera House. Quietly pushed by the Arts Council, over
the next year it will work out a formula for autonomy which will then be
presented to its main financial supporters, the Arts Council and the
Birmingham City Council.
Peter Wright, the director, said this week as he announced the programme for
1993-94, the fourth season since the company changed its prefix from
Sadler's Wells to Birmingham, that the move to independence was 'bound to
happen' but 'we have to proceed with the utmost caution.'
Certainly he is not interested in rivalry with the Royal Ballet in London.
There is too much joint experience and joint reliance on the Royal Ballet
School for the next generations of dancers, not to speak of a joint
collective memory held in past productions, for a simple cut to the
umbilical cord.
Wright held out the possibility of a new Royal Ballet School in Birmingham
but made it clear that it must be associated with the existing school in
Richmond.
The formula for autonomy then is likely to involve the use of the Royal
Opera House as a services centre, with BRB buying what it needs - a system
roughly akin to independent rail companies paying British Rail to use
established track. But such a formula may be easier to devise than to bring
into operation. It presupposes that the BRB can pay its way. And that is by
no means sure. In the 1992-93 financial year it received an Arts Council
subsidy of Pounds 4.7m and a Birmingham City Council grant of Pounds
980,000, both increased from the year before.
For all that, BRB still ended the year with a Pounds 232,000 deficit,
absorbed in the Royal Opera House accounts. This year, though, the
Birmingham City Council grant is down to Pounds 850,000 and Wright warned
that 'funding from the Arts Council may be going downwards rather than
upwards.'
Reduced grants and the absence of a parent would put BRB in a financial
trough. BRB's administrator Derek Purnell said the City 'is reluctant to
agree to a formula of deficit; it wants it to come with a clean sheet.'
BRB's independence is thus likely to involve more corporate sponsorship
unless it falls back on an endless diet of theatre-filling Tchaikovsky
ballets.

THE CROWN OF DALEMARK by Diana Wynne Jones Mandarin Pounds 3.99, 494 pages
CHILDREN have an appetite for fantasy that is largely lacking in adults.
That much is a truism, But why? Because fantasy feeds the child's own
appetite for the freest and the wildest kind of speculation upon every
aspect of the mystery of the life into which it has just been catapulted.
That is not to say, however, that successful fantasy does not depend upon
rules. On the contrary, rules are of the essence. Good fantasy - Mary
Norton's The Borrowers, for example, or Alice - may distort life (by a trick
as simple as enlargement or miniaturisation, for example) but it also oddly
mirrors it. Its truths are queerly, subversively true. Values and
anti-values intermesh in provocatively interesting ways, and it is all to
the good if (as in Alice again) the 'real' world that a book has been oddly
mirroring reasserts itself at the end of all that speculative travelling.
And this is precisely what happens in The Crown of Dalemark, the fourth and
final book in Diana Wynne Jones's Dalemark cycle of novels.
Diana Wynne Jones has been limning the features of the imaginary kingdom of
Dalemark for almost 20 years. The first three books in the cycle appeared
relatively close together, between 1975 and 1979, while this fourth and
concluding novel (which is also, incidentally, the longest by far) has
occupied her intermittently for the past ten years. The chronological span
of the quartet is enormous - from the pre-history of the kingdom to its
present day - but our attention is by no means equally divided amongst the
different historical epochs.
The quartet begins with Cart and Cwidder (Mandarin, Pounds 3.99) which is
set in the South of the country sometime in the 18th century, and it
describes the time-honoured role of the mysterious Singers, an ancient race
of itinerant musicians who are able to travel freely between the North and
South of the country: public performers, but also custodians of many old
customs, sayings and beliefs. In this book we learn one of the most
important facts about Dalemark itself: that the country, once ruled by a
king, is now divided between the North and the South, and that within each
of these separate parts there are a number of warring earldoms.
The second book, Drowned Ammet (Mandarin, Pounds 3.99) which is set in the
Earldom of Holand (also in the South), is almost entirely taken up with an
account of the growth to maturity of one young boy, Mitt, whose father is
killed in a hopeless attempt to overthrow Earl Hadd, the tyrannical ruler of
the country. Mitt vows to assassinate him, and when he fails he is obliged
to flee North by sea.
The third book, The Spellcoats, plunges us back into pre-history. Tanaqui
the weaver and her family, all natives of the village of Shelling in the
prehistoric Riverlands kingdom of Dalemark, are suspected by the rest of the
villagers of being in thrall to some evil influence that has set a blight
upon the village and its life; when the great flood arrives, the family
flees downriver to the sea. At this stage in its history, Dalemark is under
threat from invading Heathen forces.
The fourth book, The Crown of Dalemark, pulls the various strands together.
Mitt, now a fugitive in the North of the country, is ordered to kill a young
unknown woman in order to safeguard the lives of his friends. That unknown
woman, he discovers, is no less than the person who has been chosen to
reunite the ancient kingdom of Dalemark by riding the royal road to
Kernsburgh: Noreth Onesdaughter.
But there is a pleasing shock in store - on page 61 of this last book, after
we have thoroughly immersed ourselves in the alternative world of a fantasy
kingdom that has been constructed so painstakingly, detail by detail, over
almost 900 pages of prose, we find ourselves in the company of Maewen, a
teenage girl on a train in the present, who is travelling to meet her
father, Head Curator of the Tannoreth Palace, the royal palace that stands
in the old part of the new town of Kernsburgh. According to him, Maewen is
related to Amil the Great, the old king that built the palace, through her
mother's line.
And when Noreth Onesdaughter is brutally murdered, it is Maewen who is
called back to the past as a substitute in order for the history of the
kingdom to run its appointed course. And why Maewen anyway? Can it be more
than the fact that she is Noreth Onesdaughter's spitting image?
This is Wynne Jones at her most inspired - scrambling the centuries,
gyrating the real and the unreal, the 'fantasy' of the past and the
'reality' of the present, at such a speed that everything merges in a
delicious miasma of one's own imaginings.

THE GILDED GUTTER LIFE OF FRANCIS BACON by Daniel Farson Century Pounds
17.99, 273 pages
IN ONE of his Interviews with Francis Bacon (new edition 1979) David
Sylvester asked him about the recurring image of the Crucifixion in his
painting. The painter said that the Cross was only a convenient 'armature'
for different forms, and denied that it had any religious significance in
his work although the outline treatment, he agreed, was derived from
Cimabue. Bacon saw the whole subject as 'just an act of man's behaviour, a
way of behaviour to another'.
This reply led Sylvester to probe further: why, if that was so, did an aura
of religion hang over several other paintings, such as the famous series of
popes with their origin in the portrait by Velasquez of Innocent X. This
prompted Bacon to make a distinction between being a painter in a period
when the Christian faith was a part of the culture out of which the work
came and being a painter now, when it was not.
'You see (Bacon continued), all art has now become completely a game by
which man distracts himself; and you may say it has always been like that,
but now it's entirely a game. And I think that that is the way things have
changed, and what is fascinating now is that it's going to become much more
difficult for the artist, because he must really deepen the game to be any
good at all'.
What is so shocking in Bacon's work to the spectator - the distortions of
the human face into the blurred grotesquerie of his portraits, the ripping
open of the human body where the innards are repulsively exposed, and the
gestures of suffering transmitted in screaming countenances - is that all of
these were for Bacon simply various ways of 'deepening the game'.
The artist remains neutral, dispassionate, unaffected by these horrors. If
anything he sees an aesthetic beauty in them, just as he loves the tonal
beauty of the reds of the slaughtered carcasses hanging in a butcher's shop.
And now in the recollections of Daniel Farson who, as a drinking pal and
fellow-roisterer over 30 years, knew Bacon well, a similar attitude - of
deepening the game while standing aloof from it - emerges throughout Bacon's
life.
This book of Farson's is not any kind of formal biography, rather an
extended piece of anecdotage, placing Bacon firmly in his natural habitat,
the world of the Soho pubs. It is slight but readable, some of it re-cycled
from Farson's Soho in the Fifties; but the same story told many times is an
endemic feature of Soho society, and the book certainly gives a revealing
and lively view of Bacon as he appeared to his bar-stool chums.
He gravitated to Fitzrovia early on, when he arrived here from Ireland where
he had been brought up by his father, a horse-breeder; or rather by the
latter's groom and stable-lads who indoctrinated him into homosexual sex. In
the frenetic days before the second world world in London, Bacon was a
struggling, penniless, obscure, gay young artist, working briefly in the
rag-trade. What is remarkable is how loyal Bacon remained for the rest of
his long life not to any particular individual (he was ruthless about
ditching ex-friends and ex-dealers) but to the Soho pubs-and-clubs milieu.
Most artists leave their youthful haunts behind them when they become rich
and famous, but not Bacon. He was still to be found at Muriel Belcher's The
Colony Room ('little more than a small and shabby room with a lavatory and a
telephone at the back') or the York Minster ('the French pub' after its
proprietor, Gaston Berlemont) even when his paintings were on sale for
telephone number sums at the Marlborough Gallery, many of them to be snapped
up by the Tate or the Museum of Modern Art in New York. A sprightly
octogenaraian, he died just over a year ago, leaving his entire estate worth
around Pounds 10m to his long-standing boyfriend.
Bacon had a great contempt for money but luckily, from around 1950 onwards,
was never short of it. A few weeks ago I reviewed a biography of Maurice
Chevalier which revealed how he would go to extraordinary lengths to avoid
paying a restaurant bill even after he had become a millionaire. Bacon was
just the opposite. He always paid for the drinks and for the meal afterwards
and became angry with anyone who tried to do so instead.
It was, Farson tells us, the custom for him to say at the end of a heavy
Soho drinking-session, 'let's go ' - at which point four or five of them
would repair across the road to Wheeler's fish restaurant in Old Compton
Street where they would tuck into plates of oysters washed down with
champagne, all paid for by Bacon (eventually). The book contains an
interesting photograph from the 1950s of Bacon at his regular table there,
surrounded by fellow-painters including Lucian Freud and Frank Auerbach, but
the company was not usually quite as distinguished as that.
Bacon's well-known passion for gambling - he was an habitue of casinos in
the South of France - appears as an offshoot of this same uninhibited
attitude to money. Farson follows him abroad to the green baize pastures,
enumerating some of his very large wins and equally large losses. It was all
part of trying to get the maximum kicks from each lifelong minute with no
thought of the consequences.
This attitude extended to his own work. He seems to have had a distaste for
much of that too. Yet he was a tireless worker, making full use of the early
morning from six onwards, capable of painting his way doggedly through some
almighty hangovers; but, having spent weeks finishing something, he would
frequently destroy it because it displeased him. Farson describes how Bacon
once saw in the window of a Bond Street gallery a portrait he had done of a
friend who had stolen it from his studio. He wrote out a huge cheque for it,
and then stamped it to extinction on the pavement outside.
I once met him and can vouch for the captivatingly ebullient, fearlessly
spontaneous manner of which Farson gives many examples. Farson says that
Bacon rarely talked about Ireland and his background but strangely enough on
this occasion he did. He tried to define the Irish attitude to sex, which he
described as being in a large measure 'the immorality of the mouth' by which
I understood him to mean talking about it rather than actually doing it.
That, one gathers from Farson, was not something of which Bacon himself was
guilty.

FT  24 APR 93 / Books: Chinese gamble over Hong Kong's future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM EARNSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE END OF HONG KONG by Robert Cottrell John Murray Pounds 19.99, 244 pages
HONG Kong is such an amazing freak of history and the game over its future
is such a gamble and so uncertain that it is surprising there are not more
books written about it. One reason, no doubt, is that the story does not
stand still long enough for anyone to write a book which is not going to be
overtaken by developments long before it is published.
Robert Cottrell, in The End of Hong Kong, solves the problem by ending the
narrative in 1984. This gives the book a better shot at longevity, but a
smaller claim to relevance. The book details every step of the complex
quadrille danced by diplomats from Peking and London in the early 1980s,
leading to the 1984 Joint Declaration under which China will take back Hong
Kong at midnight on June 30, 1997.
As a reference work on the era, it is excellent. Cottrell, a former
correspondent of the Financial Times, includes some nice insider details
from the British/Hong Kong side which flesh out the story. His description
of how, during the confidence crisis in 1983, the government decided to peg
the Hong Kong dollar to the US dollar at the rate of 7.80 - which survives
today - is fascinating: 'There was an initial inclination to set the rate at
HKDollars 8, a number which had the additional advantage of being considered
auspicious in Hong Kong, because it supplied in Cantonese a near-homophone
for 'prosperity'. But Bremridge felt that HKDollars 8 was too simple a
number, lacking an appropriate air of scientific calculation. A slightly
stronger rate, HKDollars 7.80 was arbitrarily fixed and then published. The
peg was in place.'
On the negotiations over Hong Kong's future, the book lacks the balance of
insider detail from the Chinese side. But perhaps there was not much more to
say. Thereby hangs the book's biggest problem - the outcome of the
negotiations on Hong Kong's future was never in doubt. As a result, much of
the detail of the negotiations, while riveting at the time, is irrelevant
from a longer-term perspective.
The British began the negotiations in 1982 with the position that Britain
had to retain a role in the administration of the territory for it to remain
prosperous. That may or may not have been true, but the point was
irrelevant. China's top priority, based on what you might call Opium War
psychology, was to take back Hong Kong no matter what the consequences.
Not only was the outcome inevitable, but there is also a chance that the
document that resulted, the Joint Declaration, may prove in the long run to
be irrelevant, or interpreted by China's current or future leaders in ways
entirely contrary to what the British thought they were agreeing to.
As Lord Derwent aptly put it in the debate on Hong Kong in the House of
Lords last December: 'The problem with the Joint Declaration is rather the
same as the problem with the Maastricht Treaty. It is so cleverly drafted
that it is possible for the two sides to agree on every word of the text
without there being any real agreement on what it means or how it can be
applied.'
One of the most basic misunderstandings over the years has been over the
famous Chinese promise to Hong Kong of 'One Country, Two Systems' for 50
years beyond 1997. The Chinese basically meant two economic systems, while
Westerners very often assumed they meant two political systems. They didn't.
In a way, the really interesting story begins where Cottrell ends - with the
changes unleashed by the Joint Declaration which are transforming Hong Kong
from a British colony into a Chinese city. The process is almost complete.
He mentions some post-1984 developments in passing in an Afterword: the
flight of money and talent in the late 1980s and early 1990s; the growing
economic power of southern China; and Britain's inconclusive flirtations
with Hong Kong democracy, before and after the 1989 Tiananmen Square
incident, which have landed Governor Chris Patten in the soup. But it is all
such a moving target that it is hard to blame Cottrell for ending the story
where he does.

RHODESIANS NEVER DIE by Peter Godwon and Ian Hancock Oxford Pounds 35, 400

SMALL WARS, SMALL MERCIES by Jeremy Harding Viking Pounds 18, 442 pages
HIGH NOON IN SOUTHERN AFRICAby Chester Crocker W W Norton Dollars 24.95, 384

'Rhodesian born, Rhodesian bred, strong in arm, thick in head'.
This disparaging ditty appears in Rhodesians Never Die, a fascinating and
learned analysis of the tribe to which I belong, albeit as a renegade
member.
Strong of arm, certainly. At one stage Rhodesia had enough cricketers in
English county sides to have made up a decent Test XI. Not so thick in head.
Those who have made their intellectual mark abroad include the former editor
of The Economist, a senior member of the British government, and a host of
businessmen, writers and academics. Not bad for Surbiton in Africa.
Nevertheless the ditty could well serve, broadly speaking, as the conclusion
to a demolition of the myths and delusions which sustained white Rhodesia in
the 1970s. Also revealed is the skullduggery and rivalry in the ranks of the
security forces during the last days of white rule. The remarkable
transition to peace and independence in 1980 was closer to disaster than
most people realised.
Much of the tribe is now scattered around the world, a harmless
post-colonial diaspora. A contact magazine offers nostalgia, army
memorabilia, and the news that Jock and Hazel, ex-Fort Victoria, offer a bed
and beer to 'Rhodies' passing through Vancouver. Yet for nearly 15 years
Jock and Hazel and their like defied the world. Never more than 275,000 of
them, and outnumbered 15 to 1 by blacks, they were eventually ground down by
sanctions and a guerrilla war.
Over 20,000 people died - 468 white and 7,790 black civilians, 1,361 members
of the security forces (just under half of them white) and 10,450
guerrillas. By comparison South Africa is getting off lightly. Apartheid's
death toll over the past decade is under 10,000. On a deaths-to-population
ratio, South Africa would have to endure 120,000 fatalities before reaching
a settlement.
The Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 brought out the best and
the worst of white Rhodesia, caught up in the myth of a frontier society of
pioneer stock which defended Christian values. Most were not Rhodesian-born;
the majority were immigrants, as Godwin and Hancock point out. But they kept
Morris Minors on the road, and Viscounts in the air, longer than anyone
thought possible. They broke sanctions with ingenuity, and either
manufactured what they formerly imported, or managed without.
The dark side is that white Rhodesia tortured its enemies, executed jailed
guerrillas in secret and lacked the decency to tell next-of-kin, and
compulsorily regrouped thousands of peasant families in 'protected villages'
which became urban slums.
All this was known. Other truly terrible deeds have since been revealed. Ken
Flower, Smith's intelligence chief, recruited a black church minister to
supply poisoned clothing to youngsters who thought they were joining the
guerrillas. Hundreds died a horrible death; Flower had the minister
assassinated to avoid exposure, but recounts the tale in his autobiography.
As Donal Lamont, the deported Catholic bishop observed, white Rhodesians
became moral pygmies, and Godwin and Hancock put them under the microscope.
It was Flower and his colleagues who helped cultivate civil war in
neighbouring Mozambique, one of the African battlefields so vividly and
intimately covered by Jeremy Harding in Small Wars, Small Mercies. Rhodesia
helped arm and train Renamo, retaliation for Mozambique's support for
guerrillas. Harding picks up the story from later on, when Flower's work had
been taken over by South Africa.
Mozambique became part of the front-line in the battle against apartheid, as
did Angola, also on Harding's itinerary. If one takes their death tolls into
account, the cost of ending white rule in Southern Africa is measured in the
hundreds of thousands.
His account is not a catalogue of despair, however. Whether in Eritrea or
southern Africa he finds an extraordinary resilience, 'people contriving to
live beyond the wars, or in spite of them.' Harding draws on his own
expertise, but one of the merits of his book is that he lets Africans do
most of the talking.
Small wars, millions dead: who cares? For a while Washington did. Patient,
skilful diplomacy by Chester Crocker, the US assistant secretary of state
for Africa for much of the 1980s, extricated South Africa and Cuba from
their entanglement in south-western Africa. With the vital help of Moscow,
the process secured independence for Namibia and also paved the way to what
should have been a lasting peace in Angola.
Crocker moved on in 1988 and began writing what is an engrossing and
invaluable handbook on diplomacy in southern Africa. The tragedy is that the
book came too late to instruct his successors under President Bush. The
lessons it contains have been ignored. Washington bears as much of the blame
for the disaster in Angola today as the hapless United Nations monitors.

IMAGINING PARIS: EXILE, WRITING AND AMERICAN IDENTITY by J Gerald Kennedy
Yale Pounds 25, 269 pages
BERNARD Shaw's aphorism about England and America being separated by a
common language certainly applies to literary criticism. J. Gerald Kennedy's
Imagining Paris is a case in point.
The idea is interesting enough: that the reason why Paris has attracted so
many American writers has had more to do with what the city represented than
what it actually was. Between Henry James' ecstatic account of reeling
through the streets and Mary McCarthy's decision to settle there after the
Second World War, a large number of American writers have testified to the
impact of Paris on their lives and work. Professor Kennedy chooses three of
them: Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, and Henry Miller. An additional
chapter under the heading of 'Modernism as Exile' deals briefly with Scott
Fitzgerald and Djuna Barnes.
Fair enough. This, after all, is what every American graduate student is
taught to do. First, choose your topic, then confine it to a limited number
of authors. Too many details about too many writers would arouse the
antagonism of the examiners. So ignore Edith Wharton and Ezra Pound; ignore
John Dos Passos, HD, William Carlos Williams, and Thomas Wolfe; ignore
Sylvia Beach. Point Two: never venture your own opinion; always quote
authorities.
The result is a dullness beyond belief. I should know. For many years it was
my lot to review the hundreds of books about American literature which pour
from the university presses every year. All of them followed the same
pattern whether they were called Imagining Paris or The Fine Hammered Steel
of Herman Melville. One would have thought that by the time American
academics had reached Professor Kennedy's maturity they would have shaken
off their shackles. But no. The habit is too ingrained.
But there have naturally been exceptions. FO Matthiessen, Henry Nash Smith,
Perry Miller, Lionel Trilling and Yvor Winters are examples of American
academics who have been bold and talented enough to move from methodology to
idiosyncrasy. But it is perhaps significant that the most brilliant of them
all, RP Blackmur, never went to university at all, and Edmund Wilson kept
well away.
None of this would matter very much if the products of American scholarship
were confined to the academy for in-group seminars, but sometimes they are
unleashed on the general public. Not that one should be too hard on
Professor Kennedy. He obviously hasn't a clue that he is doing anything out
of the ordinary.
And indeed he is not. In the time-honoured fashion he trundles out one
opinion after another. A Joshua Meyrowitz proclaims that television, 'that
most insidious instrument of post-modern culture,' has deeply undermined our
sense of place. Leonard Lutwack has remarked that we lack a theory of the
formal use of place in literature. Edward Relph speaks of places as focuses
of intention. Yi-Fu Tuan believes that place is a concretion of value. And
so on. Yet, beyond this nonsense, there is much to commend in Professor
Kennedy's study.
He succeeds best where he follows the text. The Stein material comes to life
as he describes Stein and Picasso embracing when they discover that the
Germans have not touched Picasso's precious canvases. Henry Miller's
preoccupation with images of birth and the female genitalia is (naturally)
referred back to his childhood. Hemingway's latent homosexuality is also
traced back - in this case to the fact that his genteel mother in Oak Park
dressed him in girls' clothes. Very little of the material is original, but
it is neatly brought together. So, if the reader can gloss over Professor
Kennedy's authorities, there is enough to reward him in this oddly
schizophrenic book.

FT  24 APR 93 / Property: Like Brittany - but better - A rich choice of
houses in East Anglia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNUSUAL houses at reasonable prices, and a rich choice of things to do,
await those who venture into East Anglia. Pass on from Essex to Suffolk and
you can go racing at Newmarket and sailing in the estuaries.
After sailing, how about a concert in Aldeburgh? Benjamin Britten's music
paints the fickle North Sea, the bleak mud flats and the free spirit of East
Anglian towns, as robustly independent as Delft or Hoorn are over the water
in Holland. Oysters and Muscadet at the Oysterage in Orford will bring
memories of holidays in Brittany. Then visit Blythburgh church, the
cathedral of the marshes, and Dedham and Flatford, where Constable painted,
and you know you are still in England.
Stunning churches throughout East Anglia beat anything Brittany offers. They
rose from the profits of the Middle Ages' wool trade. Often, the village has
disappeared, leaving a powerful ghost in a church you see for miles across
the low ground. And, for the mystery of it all, read The Nine Tailors of
Dorothy Sayers, who grew up in a Norfolk rectory.
Church crawling becomes a major sport and a diversion from beach holidays at
Great Yarmouth or at Brancaster and Blakeney, on the north Norfolk coast,
which became popular when Edward VII, as Prince of Wales, rebuilt
Sandringham. Today, the towns and villages boast good shops and restaurants.
The delicatessen in Cley-next-the-Sea, near Blakeney, sells fresh pasta and,
in a shed in a Blakeney garden, lurks a second-hand book shop of rare
quality.
Norwich is the heart of its county. Treats in town are the Castle Museum
with its collections of John Sell Cotman and Lowestoft china and, for
something more piquant, the Colmans Mustard Museum. Then, go out to the
University of East Anglia to see its campus, designed by architect Denys
Lasdun. The jewel is Norman Foster's 1975 Sainsbury Centre for the Visual
Arts, and its modern art. It began as a resplendent aluminium and glass
palace that shone in the sun, but lost some of its gleam two years ago when
white plastic panels replaced the aluminium because they leaked. It
continues to be worth the journey.
Trains to East Anglia are good, as are the main roads (but watch the
juggernauts). The A12 from London speeds up to Ipswich, Lowestoft and Great
Yarmouth, and the M11 and A11 to Norwich. Across country to the Midlands,
the soon-to-be-completed A45 leads from Felixstowe to Bury St Edmunds,
Cambridge, Northampton and Coventry. In a tiny, remote Norfolk village, the
big world is still near.
House prices soared late in the 1980s, especially in Norfolk from the impact
of the M11, and have fallen as dramatically - to 40 per cent below the
levels of four and five years ago. Agents have accustomed vendors to the
realism of reduced expectations. But that looks to be changing. Demand is
picking up, and there are more serious buyers with cash who are tiring of
temporary living in a flat.
If confidence really is returning, prices should harden. But Norwich remains
affected by employment worries, as Bidwells reports in its quarterly review;
this could hold back recovery. All agents agree, though, that they want new
instructions to sell - at sensible levels - and foresee that there might not
be enough houses for sale to meet the demand. It is a problem in East Anglia
that while there are splendid properties in all price ranges, there are not
so many of them as in the rest of the country.
Heveningham Hall, much discussed in the media last year - and 'the grandest
Georgian mansion in Suffolk,' according to art historian Sir Nikolaus
Pevsner - remains unsold and still has a guide price of Pounds 4.5m (from
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley and Savills).
New on the market is a more modest mansion: the 16th-l8th century, brick,
Grade II Narborough Hall near Swaffham, which comes with an ice house,
cricket ground, two lakes, a boat house, lordship of the manor and 79 acres.
What more could you want for around Pounds 800,000? (from Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley). Unless, that is, you wish to spend Pounds 500,000 less and buy
Narside (through Bidwells in Norwich).
This looks as if it were the dower house of the hall and has the mill leet
(the channel taking water to a mill) in the grounds. A bridge spans the leet
and has a bench where you can watch the water flow by, or fish for trout.
Still on the grand side are Irmingland Hall and its estate 16 miles
north-west of Norwich (Pounds 1.4m from Strutt &amp; Parker); and Sproughton
Manor, near Ipswich, a Victorian house for around Pounds 450,000 (from
Carter Jonas) and designed to impose - as was an Elizabethan counterpart,
The Hall at Burrough Green, near Newmarket (around Pounds 375,000 from
Hamptons).
The double bow-fronted, late-Georgian old rectory with 29 acres at Hitcham,
near Stowmarket, recalls the social position of the clergy (around Pounds
600,000 from Bidwells in Ipswich).
In the humbler vernacular of half-timbering are the same agent's
pink-painted Aspen Grove at Assington Green, near Sudbury (around Pounds
250,000); and, with thatch, The Walnuts in Wattisfield, near Diss (around
Pounds 179,000).
Carter Jonas offers The White House - which is white and looks like three
cottages joined together - at Foxhall, just outside Ipswich (Pounds
238,000); and a flint and brick farmhouse at Woodbridge (Pounds 197,500).
Jackson-Stops is selling the flint and brick Victorian Gothic Gazeley Mill
Cottage near Newmarket (Pounds 129,000), and the truly ancient Old Hall at
South Wootton, near King's Lynn (Pounds 220,000, down from Pounds 240,000).
Frost offers the charming Grade II, pink, half-timbered Corner House in
Kersey, near Hadleigh (Pounds 175,000).
Curlews, on the edge of Blakeney, is a brick, flint and thatch house
overlooking the salt marshes (Bidwells in Norwich, Pounds 275,000). The
Georgian Rosalie Farm is just six miles from Newmarket and has three
paddocks (Bedford, Pounds 395,000). In Norwich, Strutt &amp; Parker is selling
two Georgian brick houses in The Crescent (Pounds 215,000 and Pounds
225,000).
Two unusual names are Mausoleum House in Felsham, near Bury St Edmunds,
which has been in the same family since it was built in 1780 (Brown, Pounds
195,000); and Sally Beans on the edge of Cromer (Strutt &amp; Parker in Norwich,
Pounds 99,500). And for a truly unusual house (or, perhaps, four flats),
there is the converted Redgate Water Tower at Hunstanton, a 1912 Norman keep
in red brick. From its Astroturfed roof garden, you can man the battlements.
Jackson-Stops is asking Pounds 200,000 as a whole or Pounds 100,000 for the
penthouse on the top two floors.

FT  24 APR 93 / Sport: Sampras replaces Courier as king of the courts -
Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU MAY not even have noticed, but last Sunday in Hong Kong, Pete Sampras
beat Jim Courier 6-3 6-7 7-6 in the final of the Salem Open. Nothing special
about that, you might think. But it was a poignant moment in the careers of
both young Americans. Nine days earlier, in Tokyo, 21-year-old Sampras had
won his quarter-final against another American, David Wheaton, to displace
Courier as the No. 1 ranked player in the world. He is the 11th man to reach
that pinnacle since the computer rankings were introduced in 1973. The Hong
Kong victory therefore clearly stated: 'The king is dead; long live the
king.'
Ironically, it was Courier's accession to the throne in February 1992 that
sparked the ambition in Sampras to emulate him. 'Seeing Jim at No. 1 sets a
goal for me,' he said at the time. 'I believe it's something I can do, too.
It's a matter of staying healthy and playing consistently.'
Yet, even with the help of his new coach Tim Gullickson, Sampras could not
find that elusive consistency last year, especially in the Grand Slam
Championships. Although he won five tournaments he ended 1992 ranked third
after losing in the final of the US Open to Stefan Edberg, the semi-finals
at Wimbledon and the quarter-finals in Paris.
This year Sampras could hardly have been more consistent. He has already
captured four titles, starting with the outdoor event in Sydney last
January. That was a prelude to his semi-final finish at the Australian Open.
Even his physical frailties seem to be under control. During his winning run
in Key Biscayne last month he told me that he was taking pain killers for
the shin splints that have troubled him since 1990 when, at 19 years and 28
days, he became the youngest ever winner of the US Open.
'I don't like it but at least it means I can compete. Anyway I shall have
two weeks off to rest them before I have to play in Tokyo, it should be
enough.'
As the world now knows, it was indeed enough. Too much for Courier. These
two have been friends and rivals since their junior days. As young
professionals they were room-mates at the Nick Bollettieri Academy in
Florida where Agassi was also in residence. They won their first important
title together - the 1989 Italian Open doubles in Rome.
When I first saw him, Pete had just embarked upon his professional career.
It was at Palm Springs in 1988. In those days he was a shy, gangling
16-year-old, all arms and legs, with smooth, effortless strokes but not much
idea how to use them. To all of us it was apparent that here was a player
with limitless potential.
He beat the graceful Indian Ramesh Krishnan in the first round, saving three
match points in the process. That was a good sign. Then he upset a man who
had taught him much about match play at the Rancho Palos Verdes Club outside
Los Angeles where they were both members. Eliot Teltscher was less than
pleased at being beaten in straight sets. 'I always knew the kid was going
to be good,' he said. 'But I didn't think it was going to happen so soon.'
Nor did anyone else. Sampras did not have a spectacular junior career.
Although he could always beat the local opposition he could not make an
impact nationally. Courier, Agassi or Michael Chang always seemed to be in
the way. 'I couldn't serve and I had no real idea of how to volley,' he
recalls. 'I was just trying to play the way all the kids played -
counter-punching from the baseline. I realised I would have to do something
about my game.'
unofficial (and unpaid) coach for some years. Together they decided that if
he was to make progress and become a volleyer, Pete would have to forsake
his double-handed backhand.
Stefan Edberg had made a similar change at the suggestion of Percy Rosberg,
who had been Bjorn Borg's first coach. Wisely Rosberg had left Borg with his
effective two-hander but had changed Edberg because he had recognised
Stefan's ability as a volleyer.
It was the same with Sampras. But the change was painful. 'After six months
of hitting the fence and losing my temper a few started to go in. It was a
great relief]' he says.
Ever since, more and more have been going in. Nowadays Sampras has the most
complete game of all the leading men. His serve, fired at around 130 mph,
has become Lethal Weapon 4, his groundstrokes, taken on the rise and hit
flat and fast are as penetrating as any, and his volleys are punched firmly
or caressed with sweet touch, according to the situation.
So what sort of man is the new world No. 1? In a word: confident. That had
always been the missing ingredient. Following his unexpected success at the
1990 US Open there followed two years of growing into the position. Pete's
girlfriend De-Laina Mulcahy, a law graduate, has had a positive influence on
the process. The benefit was clear in Key Biscayne. The mature way Sampras
dealt with some of the most testing playing conditions I have seen was a
revelation. A year ago he would not have coped.
So far this year Sampras has served 366 aces, over 100 more than his nearest
challenger Michael Stich, even though he has got in less than 64 per cent of
his first serves in. As Ivan Lendl used to say, it is not the percentage
that matters but the moment. Sampras also leads the field on first serve
points won (81 per cent), service games won (91 per cent) and break points
saved (72 per cent). This superiority on serve gives him the freedom to go
for his returns and gain enough breaks to win his matches.
The killer streak, essential to success, has become more obvious as Pete has
added confidence to his greater physical strength. He is now the perfectly
proportioned athlete, strong, fit and fast. Yet, beneath the hard exterior
is the same gentle individual. When he won Dollars 2m at the Compaq Grand
Slam Cup in 1990 he gave Dollars 50,000 towards research into cerebral palsy
which had claimed an uncle.
Hardly surprising, this, from a man whose hero as a youth was the greatest
of them all, Australia's double Grand Slam winner, Rod Laver who was the
epitome of sportsmanship and athletic chivalry. Watching tapes of the great
man's matches was part of Pete's training routine. If he goes on developing
(and, as he readily admits, there is room for improvement), tapes of Pete
Sampras's matches will become required study for today's embryonic
champions.

FT  24 APR 93 / Sport: Grass masters protect their turf - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I WOULD not do it for any other newspaper. A long journey into Yorkshire, a
cold, hard afternoon's labours, then a long journey home late at night. It
was worth it; the grass roots are fascinating.
The Sports Turf Research Institute, in Bingley, west of Leeds is a charity,
founded by the Golfing Union in 1929. By the 1950s it was researching into
all types of sports turf, with all their ailments, at the service of golf,
bowls, cricket, football, hockey, rugby and racing.
Cricket is overshadowed by golf at the Institute but that, they assured me,
is cricket's fault. There was a turf revolution in golf about four years
ago, following a lot of trouble about bad surfaces. Golf's administrators
consulted the Institute's experts. Today golf is overflowing with committees
in charge of the construction and maintenance of golf courses.
'That's what we were founded for,' the institute's director, Dr Peter Hayes,
said with satisfaction. Cricket has yet to have its turf revolution. It
keeps its turf to itself, away from the Institute's relentless enthusiasm
for research.
'Senior groundsmen have a kind of aura attached to them which cannot be
penetrated,' said Dr Hayes wearily. 'All cricketing authorities are
difficult to advise. They are well meaning amateurs. They don't understand
the importance of research.'
When I talked to Tim Lamb, secretary of the Test and County Cricket Board's
pitches committee, he gave a weary sigh of his own. 'The STRI is all
science. They are boffins who don't understand the practical side of making
good pitches under match conditions. Pitches are different when you play on
them.'
The amateurs and the boffins talk to each other at times, but remain at odds
in the vast underworld of the cricket pitch. It is a world which only hits
the headlines when people want a scapegoat for poor English performances,
but it is always taut with pressures and politics. It is populated by
players, groundsmen, executives, researchers and, unofficially, the local
expert who has sat in the same seat for 40 years, watching every game and
comparing every wicked wicket with the real old fliers and skidders of his
youth. Such an old faithful preferred the good old days when there was not
all this fuss about wickets. He has a point.
Back in the great days of Hambledon, Richard Nyren described the ideal pitch
simply as a 22-yard stretch of the cricket ground, not to be altered 'by
rolling, watering, covering, mowing or beating' during a match. Subtleties
of texture did not come into it when the turf was to be 'if possible fed
down by sheep.'
In time, the culture of first class cricket turf grew more sophisticated,
leaving the ovine mower in history. Cricket magazine attributed batsman
Richard Humphrey's suicide in 1906 to the grim old pitches that had
undermined his early batting, before 'the later years, when pitches were
vastly improved'. Today the improvement of pitches is verging on an
obsession.
It is Graham Gooch's favourite topic of conversation; he is always happy to
talk about the need for better wickets, without which he sees no future for
English cricket.
Both the TCCB and the STRI are reluctant to give a precise definition of a
perfect pitch because requirements vary from place to place, indeed within
each pitch.
'We don't want a minefield, of course,' laughed Lamb.
'Not a snooker table, of course,' said Hayes.
Both were happier talking about what they did not want. Both cited
Headingley as a problem pitch.
'It's been dug up and re-laid as many times as I've had a cooked breakfast
in the last year,' said Hayes, 'to no effect.'
In 1986 a wicket for a Yorkshire v Surry match was condemned by a TCCB
inspector. A deep shaft was dug, revealing what Lamb described as 'something
like a Neapolitan ice-cream' - layers of compressed organic matter and old
topsoils, put there by successive groundsmen. This meant that newly sown
grass could only put down weak roots, through a layer of accumulated organic
fibre or 'thatch'.
Solutions?
The TCCB is trusting to the skills of Headingley's groundsman, Keith Boyce,
who dug up and re-laid the pitch at the end of last season. Lamb pointed out
that it was the TCCB which got rid of the lush, green wickets groundsmen
were preparing in the late 1980s to suit seam bowlers. It has everything in
hand. This year's emphasis is on dry pitches to encourage spin bowlers. But
it takes time.
'It's taken them 20 years to go round in a circle,' was how they put it at
Bingley. 'There are always fashions in the soils groundsmen lay. This year
everyone is using two parts Ongar loam to one part Surrey loam because that
was successful for Harry Brind at the Oval. But there's no scientific
understanding of what makes a good wicket.'
We stood on a huge patchwork of trial turf areas. No-one could doubt the
STRI's commitment. As others said before me, only time will tell what works
best. It is a pity the assorted approaches cannot combine their work more
easily to find an answer.

not least to behave himself. This magnificent nine-year-old eventer took
Mary Thomson to her first win at Badminton in 1992. The same bold,
headstrong beast then ruined her day at the Barcelona Olympics, taking her
round the El Montanya cross country course at a speed and style that left
the rider feeling shattered and irrelevant.
'It was horrible, a nightmare. I kept thinking why is this happening to me
here, at the Olympics?' remembered Mary, as she prepared for the new season.
'He'd always been brave and forward-going but that was very close to bolting
 -ugly and horrible.
'Towards the end of the course I was beginning to run out of energy and
wasn't sure that I could continue to hold him. I was an absolute jelly when
I got off and couldn't stand up but Willy was itching to go round again.
'The irony was that because of the Spanish heat there were an army of vets
standing by to attend to any exhausted horses. I can tell you that I needed
the medical aid a great deal more than King William.'
In the media centre the world's press assumed that Mary and William had
taken the slower, safe route at many fences because they were 'riding to
orders' from a British team anxious to conserve points. This alleged excess
of caution was attacked in many papers the following day, leaving Mary and
and her team-mates angry and despondent.
With the show-jumping section still to come, they were unlikely to disclose
William's exact state of mind to the world but as Mary is now able to point
out, taking the 'chicken run' through those fences was more about saving
life than points and no one needed to tell her to do it.
It was a bitterly disappointing end to a season that had begun so well. Mary
Thomson describes 1992 in her book Mary Thomson's Eventing Year (David &amp;
Charles, Pounds 17.99). It was a spell that began with a mood dangerously
familiar to all top athletes.
'When I won at Windsor a fortnight after Badminton it was my fifth
consecutive win at a major three-day event. I was really on a roll, flying.
Willy and I didn't seem to be able to do anything wrong,' recalls Mary.
'Winning at Badminton was a dream forever. I'd been second but to win was
such a higher gear. There is nothing like actually winning and going across
country it gives you the confidence that is so important. You can fill a
horse with optimism and bravery if you're feeling totally on top of things.'
Thomson recalls the Sunday service at the little Badminton church on the
morning after three horses had fallen and had to destroyed in the
cross-country phase. It was the worst day in Badminton's history and has
caused much heart-searching, not least with Hugh Thomas, the event director
and course designer.
'I have to know in my heart that the course was OK and that is why we've had
such intensive inquiries into the whole business,' said Thomas, a former top
event rider.
'Last year's accidents hurt our image with the public and quite rightly. It
damaged peoples' perceptions of what we are about in this sport.' This year
around 200,000 spectators will come to Badminton to see 80 of the world's
top event riders compete for the Mitsubishi Trophy.
Last year after a long spell of dry weather it began to pour with rain
around dawn on cross-country day. By late morning the course was extremely
slippery, although the technical judge pronounced it fit to ride. 'It was
very difficult for the early riders but our investigations have shown that
the conditions were only a factor in the first of the three accidents,' said
Thomas.
'Once we began to get a certain pressure - not from the competitors - to
consider postponement, ironically conditions improved because the early
horses had cut the ground up a fair bit. We can't find any explanation at
all for the subsequent accidents. One fatality was in the water jump and in
all my years in the sport I can't remember such a thing. Water usually
cushions a fall.'
There have been changes. The take-off area immediately in front of each
fence will be roped off and out-of-bounds to the public for a week
beforehand. Thousands of human feet can compact the ground and make it
potentially dangerous if there is sudden rain.
'One is reluctant to spoil peoples' enjoyment and appreciation of how
difficult the whole thing is,' said Thomas. 'But safety has to come first.'
His fence repair team will switch their focus to keeping the going safe. 'It
is amazing what half-a-dozen shovelfuls of stone-dust can achieve,' said
Thomas, who confesses to coming from an era when such precautions would have
been thought wimpish.
Thomas is a technichal adviser to the International Equestrian Federation.
He is aware that in some countries eventing is seen as bordering on cruelty
to horses. Thomas is just back from Atlanta and talks with the American
Humane Society (the equivalent of the RSPCA) over their concerns relating to
the sport.
As perhaps the best-known three-day event in the world Badminton cannot
afford any more mishaps. But in the short run the most interesting question
is who will win?
King William has a new 'cherry roller' bit imported from the US which,
according to Mary, makes him easier to manage. At Belton last weekend he
went beautifully across cross country and jumped a clear round in the
show-jumping, his weakest phase. 'If Mary and King William are in the form
they were last year they will be nearly unbeatable,' believes Hugh Thomas.

FT  24 APR 93 / Sport: After the crowds melt away - Skiing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNOLD WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SKIING season is going out in a blaze of glory: what a shame there are
so few skiers to witness it. This week, the sun has been scorching down on
snow which on higher ground has defied ultra-violet and infra-red and
remains in remarkably good condition. But because skiers tend to think that
their world comes to an end at Easter there is an extraordinary, almost
surreal and ghostly emptiness in the mountains. The Alps are almost as
silent as they were before recreational skiing was invented.
In Verbier, Switzerland, teeming with people less than two weeks ago, there
were not enough people on the entire network of slopes to form a queue even
at Medran, where queues are something of a way of life in mid-season. You
could actually arrange to meet someone on the mountain just by looking out
for them: a notion that in mid-winter would be as absurd as hoping to bump
into a friend in Oxford Street during a busy Saturday afternoon.
At Courchevel, where many executive jets were leaving but few were arriving,
piste-grooming machines, for all the world like remotely-controlled
moon-buggies, resolutely continued to groom and cover-up the odd bare patch
on the lower slopes even though there was hardly a skier for miles.
Although many hotels put their shutters up this week, officially the season
does not finish in many resorts until next weekend. Will there be anyone out
there still skiing?
There are exceptions. Some British tour operators, like football fans
beginning to troop out of the ground before the final whistle, have done a
U-turn and decided to stay on as clients suddenly appear from the ether
wanting to ski next week. Just as chalet-girls have started to spring-clean,
a few skiers have woken up to the fact that there is still some good skiing
out there.
In spite of an explosive start to the season and some wonderful snow - apart
from an unnerving lack of fresh supplies between January and February - it
has been a mixed season for hoteliers, particularly in France. March,
normally the central plank of a good season, was a disaster. The effects of
the recession, exacerbated by the French themselves, who found election
fever keeping them off their own mountains, were felt particularly badly by
luxury hotels trying to take advantage of late school holidays in France by
keeping their March prices high in an attempt to extend the February high
season.
Claude Pinturault, who owns the Hotel Annapurna in Courchevel 1850, admitted
that most of Courchevel's ten four-star hotels have had miserable periods
this season. There have not been enough affluent clients to go around.
Pinturault has restructured next year's high season prices so that they will
only apply to the French school holidays from mid-February to mid-March. To
a certain extent, Courchevel has been a victim of the 'fat cat' syndrome
that has in the past shaken such self-confident resorts as Zermatt and
Aspen. Believing themselves to be unassailable they have risked pricing
themsmelves out of the market.
At least one hotel has gone bankrupt this winter in Verbier. There are
whispers about one or two in Courchevel. Yet a few four-star hotels, like
the Latitude, in Val d'Isere - which have pitched their prices more sensibly
 -have had a good season. And lower down the scale, two-star hotels, such as
the Eldorador and Aiguille Rouge, in Arc 2000, and the Eldorador, in Belle
Plagne, have enjoyed enormous success.
Although snow conditions in the Alps after Easter have been excellent for
the last three or four years, and prices are low, skiers often seem to have
melted away by then. Next year, Easter is early: April 3. It would be
inconceivable for this to signal the end of the season. Nevertheless, many
resorts and tour operators are trying to improve their lot by promoting a
summer season. Verbier is particularly anxious to fill chalets occupied by
skiers in the winter with golfers, ramblers and parapentists in the summer.
Small tour operators, such as Neal Manuel, who runs FlexiSki (071-352-0044),
have chalet apartments lying idle for much of the summer. 'The mountains
after Easter and during summer are spectacular,' he says. 'As it happens,
we've got some late bookings for next week, just as we were about to pack up
and go home.'
Verbier's tourist director, Patrick Messeiller, says: 'You can even ski here
in June and July if you want to.'
For those torn between a winter-skiing break and a summer holiday, a morning
on the slopes followed by a round of golf or some tennis in the afternoon is
a tempting combination.

FT  24 APR 93 / Gardening: Daphne, bad-tempered but so sweet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPRING is spreading at various speeds through Britain. In London, lilacs are
out already; in the Cotswolds, primroses have only just reached their peak.
But a reader in Wales has written to point out that she has yet to see
colour in anything, let alone a tulip.
Even on the Welsh steppes, one of my favourite ceremonies will soon be
challenging gardeners. Since January, daphnes have been active; but during
the next month, the best of them remind us why they are plants with which we
should all experiment.
In small gardens, city gardens or adventurous gardens, daphnes have the
quality which plain old ivy cannot command. They also have their
awkwardnesses. Some of them will grow only for experts. Others will grow for
all of us but will die back suddenly in the middle. A few of them are cheap,
and all of them have yellow roots which cannot be moved. They hate
disturbance and they hate invaders. I cannot blame them, but I also cannot
move them or fork round them safely in the hunt for weeds.
The temperamental members of this family have caused others to be
overlooked. This year, I have learned a little more about their signs of bad
temper, but I also wish to begin with varieties which anyone ought to be
able to grow.
My star performer is a daphne which is named after Naples, although it is no
longer to be seen there in its pure state. Neapolitanum will grow easily on
any well-drained soil, but it is becoming rare in the better nurseries and
needs a public campaign in its favour.
It turns into a low, neat evergreen with scented rose-pink flowers and it
never grows more than a 18 in high. It is easy and, potentially, makes neat,
low hedging, especially good in flower beds which back on to walls.
It close relation, daphne Collina, also originates from Naples and can still
be seen growing wild on rough, limestone ground to the south of the city.
Collina is much more common in the trade but it has the family's frequent
vice: bits of it will suddenly die off without reason.
Neapolitanum is a much better buy for a front garden or an evergreen clump
of five or six bushes in a bed of low-growing border plants. I hope that,
eventually, I re-make its reputation.
It is not, however, the oldest form in gardens. My vision of the daphne goes
back 1,000 years, to the Sung dynasty in China and the pleasant story of a
somnolent monk. Beneath a cliff in distant Lu Shan, he is said to have dozed
off in the shade and dreamt he was being encircled by clouds of heavenly
scent.
I have never had scented dreams, but they are not a monastic privilege: we
could all try sleeping on a bed of roses. For, when the monk woke up, he
found bushes of daphne Odora growing in the rocks above him; he was
breathing their unique scent in early spring.
He named them by the Chinese words for Sleeping Scent and bequeathed this
legend to gardeners there. Seven centuries later, we finally caught up with
China's flower culture and became aware of this enchanting shrub.
Odora's season has just finished, and I have been tidying up two bushes of
the golden-leaved form which is hardier and even sweeter. Both suffer from a
problem which did not affect Chinese monasteries: they are riddled with a
virus for which there is no cure.
Experts say the virus is the reason for those daphnes with bare lower stems
or twisted leaves at the tips of their branches. In the trade, quite often,
Odora has become debilitated because the virus is perpetuated by cuttings,
not by new introductions from the wild.
There is not much we can do. The only answer is to check carefully before
buying an Odora and reject anything which might have twisted leaves. Growers
are probably unaware of the problem, but it spoils at least half of the
stock now on sale.
This warning should not deter you, though. It has not deterred me from a new
experiment: the low daphne Mantensiana which is evergreen, sweet-scented,
and willing to cover about 2 ft in height and width. Its main flowers fall
in February and March.
Mantensiana is a post-war invention, bred in Canada from very different
parents, which I have bought and recommend. It is now beginning to circulate
more widely and deserves to make a name; but I fear it will not live forever
because it, too, seems to die in places like the familiar Collina.
Nonetheless, it is worth six or seven years' tolerance.
Perhaps these short prospects are too much for you. If so, do not desert the
family: turn, instead, to one of this post-war daphne's parents. It goes by
one of two names, Burkwoodii or Somerset, but historians and botanists agree
that the two plants have a similar parentage and do not vary.
By now, it is common in garden centres but ought to be much commoner with
customers who want a peaceful reward. Scotts of Merriott, in Somerset, was
one of those to introduce it and the firm's nursery list still remarks,
justly, that one bush of this daphne will scent an entire garden in May.
Admittedly, it is not evergreen, but it will also make a spectacular hedge
of informal, bushy proportions if you allow room for its spread and height
of about 4 ft. I have used it successfully to hedge a grass path leading out
into a less formal area of fruit treees and rough turf. Be sure to allow a
generous width of grass so that the daphnes do not eventually block the way
through.
Single bushes will scent anyone's garden, so try a short walk of Somerset
and watch out for visiting monks on the nap. The scent on this variety is
dreamy and easy for everyone - yet, we still make too little use of it in
those coming weeks when tulips, everywhere, are going over and many of us
are waiting for the main flush of roses instead.

FT  24 APR 93 / Motoring: Estates where expanse beats expense - A trio that
blend executive-class comforts with bulk carrying capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DAYS when you wanted a large estate car, could not afford a
Mercedes-Benz 200/300 and had to settle for a Renault Savanna, Volvo
240/740/940, Vauxhall Carlton or nothing have long gone. Last year, Ford put
right a major error of judgment and re-introduced a Granada (Scorpio)
estate. Shortly before that, Citroen's XM had become the champion
weight-lifter among large estate cars. Two more distinguished additions were
the Audi 100 estate and BMW's 5-Series Touring (an estate car in all but
name).
Now, Mitsubishi's Australian-built Sigma; a face-lifted, American-made
Toyota Camry; and a load-carrying version of Volvo's front-wheel driven 850
have swelled the ranks further. So, from a position of relative scarcity,
the buyer or user-chooser seeking executive-class comforts and performance
plus bulk carrying capacity is almost embarrassed for choice.
You don't have to be an antique dealer, or need to transport things like
straw bales, to appreciate the main advantage of a big estate car - the
sheer ease of putting awkward things in it. I mean things like two golf bags
attached to their trolleys; black labradors on bean bags; or folding
two-seat pushchairs, travel cots, and all the clobber parents of young
children (and sometimes their grandparents) have to lug around.
Most of these (though not the dog) will go into saloon car boots singly, if
not together. Even some of the least expensive models have big boots now and
the cavern at the tail end of a Pounds 8,695 Seat Toledo (styled like a
saloon but actually a hatchback) looks big enough to have an echo. The
flat-silled Saab 9000 is another hatchback that almost rivals a big estate
car for carrying capacity. But for sheer load space, plus ease of humping
goods in and out, a proper estate car is unmatched.
For very large objects, the best buys remain the two-litre Vauxhall Carlton
(called the Opel Rekord on mainland Europe) at Pounds 14,830 and Volvo's 240
Torslanda, one of today's greatest bargains at Pounds 13,395. Neither of
these practical work horses offers executive-class performance, though. For
this, you must pay more.
I have just sampled three big estates with three-litre engines - the Sigma,
Camry and BMW 530i Touring. With air-conditioning and automatic
transmission, they come in the Pounds 23,000-Pounds 35,000 price brackets.
Any should satisfy business users accustomed to the highest levels of
comfort, refinement and performance.
The Sigma estate might lack some of the Sigma saloon's high-tech features -
for one thing, the V6 engine driving the front wheels has two valves per
cylinder, not four - but it delivers ample power (168 bhp), is almost silent
and returned a shade over 22 mpg (12.8 l/100km). And suspension designed to
cope with fast driving in the Australian outback gives a superlative ride on
normal roads.
As a motorway cruiser, the Sigma is on a par with a Jaguar. It handles
competently, feels as solid as a German car of quality and is totally
relaxing to drive. It is a pity, though, that the rear seat cushion does not
swing forward. The back-rest sits on top of it when converting the Sigma
into a freighter, so the load floor is not completely flat. And there is
nothing to prevent a sharp-edged load from damaging the front seats should
it slide forward under heavy braking.
Toyota's three-litre, V6, front-wheel driven Camry saloon is as suave as the
standard-setting Lexus LS400, only a bit smaller. But some of this
refinement is lost in the estate version. The greater volume of the
load-carrying body amplifies what little noise there is and, when running
light, the stiffer suspension is less effective at smothering pot-holes and
bumps.
This apart, I found the Camry 3.0 V6 GX estate a rewarding car to drive. The
more I put in it, the better it went. At Pounds 23,999, it is notably good
value because a silky automatic transmission, ABS brakes, leather seats,
air-conditioning, cruise control and two rear-facing seats for children are
thrown in. As a bulk carrier, however, a potential snag is how the rear
suspension covers intrude into the load space.
The BMW 530 Touring is a jewel among estate cars. Its 218 horsepower,
32-valve V8 is of surpassing smoothness, spinning up to high revolutions
like a turbine, yet pulling without jerks in fifth gear at less than 1,000
rpm. Although a roomy estate - its load floor (rear seat folded) is 6 ft 1
in (183 cm) long - it feels, sounds and rides exactly like a saloon.
Predictably, it is expensive, with a key-in-hand price of around Pounds
32,000. This includes ABS brakes and self-levelling rear suspension but not
a radio - BMW reckons customers prefer to choose their own. Extras on my
test car included a traction control system (Pounds 1,250), driver's airbag
and power-adjusted steering column (Pounds 905), and power-adjusted front
sets (Pounds 970). Because the sun-roof had been deleted, air-conditioning
added only Pounds 350 to the price - worth every penny, in my view.
Fuel consumption is around 25 mpg (10.86 l/100km). Clutch and gear-shift are
pleasantly light but I would happily pay Pounds 1,650 extra for the optional
five-speed automatic transmission.

FT  24 APR 93 / Travel: Palm Springs - a world-class rest-stop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALIFORNIA'S desert areas were pooh-poohed initially. In a report on the
first serious reconnaissance of the desert, Lieutenant Joseph C Ives, of the
US Topographical Engineers, wrote: 'The region . . . is, of course,
altogether valueless. After entering it there is nothing to do but leave.
Ours had been the first, and will doubtless be the last, party of whites to
visit this profitless locality.'
I do not know what happened to Lt Ives, but if he drove through the desert
now and stopped at Palm Springs his eyes would pop out.
Ask an American what Palm Springs stands for and he will reply: golf,
tennis, palm trees, money, movie stars. Ask the town's tourism office what
it stands for and it will flourish the happy phrase: 'Xanadu incarnate.'
Ask me what Palm Springs stands for and I will tell you of floating in one
of its swimming pools (it has 7,000) and ruminating pleasantly on the
hundreds of activities available in and around Palm Springs that I was
gently boycotting while idling and vegging out.
Palm Springs is on the western edge of the Coachella valley - 107 miles (2
1/2 hours on the freeway) south-east of Los Angeles, within the area known
as the Colorado desert. The San Jacinto mountains are to the west, the Santa
Rosa mountains to the south.
It is 487ft above sea-level. To the east lie the other manicured
resort-cities of the Coachella valley: Cathedral City, Rancho Mirage, Palm
Desert, Indian Wells, Bermuda Dunes, La Quinta, Thousand Palms and Indio.
Palm Springs' year-round population is only 40,000 (surprisingly, property
is not expensive). And its climate - its original claim to fame, along with
its abundant water - is superb: an audited 354 days of sunshine per year and
less than 5 1/2 in of rain, with winter daytime temperatures in the 70`F's
(20`C) and summer-month levels (over 100`F) tempered by low humidity. The
May-August high is regarded as 105`F, the low as 67`F. High season is
January-April: 77`F-45`F.
To indicate the numberless activities available in and around Palm Springs,
I could do worse than quote what Carolyn Patten, of Palm Springs Tourism,
suggests for a seven-day programme:
Day 1: Stroll down Palm Canyon Drive, the city's main avenue, and note the
shops, galleries, cafes and restaurants. Return to your hotel, pick up a
good sunscreen, bask in the desert sun and try to find some pity for the
friends you left back home.
Day 2: A drive-past tour of the homes of famous residents, including the
estates of Frank Sinatra, Gerald Ford, Walter Annenberg, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Lord
Hanson and other golden oldies, as well as Palm Springs' celebrity country
clubs. And visit The Living Desert, a 1,200-acre wildlife centre, for a
close look at bighorn sheep, the desert kit fox and other birds and animals.
Day 3: Take the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway for a 2 1/2 -mile, 15-minute
cable car ride to the 8,500-ft peak of Mt San Jacinto, from where you can
see for 50 miles. And visit the Desert Museum (Western art, natural history
dioramas illustrating the history of the local Cahuilla tribe of Mission
Indians, and two sculpture gardens). Members of the Agua Caliente band of
Cahuilla Indians are among the largest of Palm Springs' present-day
landowners.
Day 4: Try the Oasis Water Resort, a 21-acre waterpark, and take a safari
ride into the foothills of the Santa Rosa mountains. For a night on the town
there are piano bars, 1940s-style nightclubs (nostalgia is big in Palm
Springs), comedy, jazz, discos and 'authentic' country &amp; western.
Day 5: Anything you like: golf, tennis, cycling, horseback riding,
pool-lounging, desert hiking. Or take a covered wagon tour through the
Coachella Valley Preserve (13,000 acres: springs, dunes, bluffs, mesas, the
Thousand Palms Oasis and plenty of wildlife, some of it rare).
Day 6: Visit Indian Canyons for fan palms, waterfalls and wildflowers. And
ride a hot-air balloon over the date groves and lazy horse country of the
eastern Coachella valley. This year, an extra-wet winter has produced one of
the best wildflower seasons in the Palm Springs area in more than a decade.
Day 7: More of whatever you like.
Sounds ever so slightly tedious? Aggressively non-cultural? The bland
leading the bland? If so, then it is worth emphasising three things about
Palm Springs that justify describing it as one of the northern hemisphere's
best winter-sun holiday spots: it is surprisingly quiet and peaceful; its
climate is superb, and it serves as a first-rate hub or springboard for
various trips.
Thanks to considerable care and effort, Palm Springs retains the small-town
charm and peaceableness of its early days, when movie stars (plus Albert
Einstein) would head there from Los Angeles to holiday at the El Mirador
hotel. Today, you might spot Sylvester Stallone or Kirk Douglas, Don Johnson
or Kim Basinger. But the important thing to know is that in Palm Springs
these movie stars do not molest you. They do not pester you for your
autograph or mob you in the supermarket. They respect your right to privacy.
Because of its desert climate, Palm Springs is a healthy place to be. In Our
Araby, an account of Palm Springs' pioneer days, J Smeaton Chase tells of
heading for Palm Springs one morning in April, circa 1915. He was with three
friends. Two were driving a camp-wagon, the other two were on horseback.
They had come from the coast. Crossing the mountains, at 2,000ft, they gazed
at the valley floor.
'The effect was highly theatrical', wrote Chase. 'Below and far ahead, at
the foot of the hollow scoop of the pass, lay a pale golden land, shimmering
in sunlight under a sky of summery blue. It was like magic, or a dream . .
.'
As they descended, they were lashed by a hail-storm, alternately thrashed by
chilly rain and pelted with hailstones. But suddenly they emerged into
glorious warmth. By early afternoon they had reached Palm Springs. 'That
night we stretched out luxuriantly under the flowering grevilleas of the
Brooks House, bathed in moonbeams and odour of orange-blossom, lulled by the
soft clatter of palm-fronds and an occasional somnambulistic outbreak from
the night-herons roosting in the cottonwoods near the spring.'
Using Palm Springs as a base, today's visitors can easily drive south to the
Mexican border (not greatly recommended: you will see more poverty and
desperation than you may have bargained for); west to the beaches (Malibu,
Santa Monica, Huntington, Newport, Laguna) or Disneyland; north to Death
Valley, or east to Joshua Tree National Monument, a national park of
startling beauty that covers 870 square miles, more than 90 per cent of
which is classified wilderness.
The park almost evenly straddles California's two deserts - the Mojave, a
high desert, and the Colorado, a low one - and is named for the
shaggy-limbed, spiny-leaved Joshua tree, in reality a tree-sized yucca, that
can live for hundreds of years. A group of Mormons, passing through the
area, saw, in the plant's upreaching limbs, an image of the prophet Joshua
praying and guiding them westward towards a promised land - hence 'praying
plant' or Joshua tree.
The largest Joshua tree in the park, at upper Covington Flat, is said to
have forked more than 100 times in its 1,000-year lifetime. It is 36ft tall,
14ft in circumference and is said to resemble a giant head of broccoli.
I did not, in fact, see it, largely because my own hire-car-safaris did not
stretch as far as Covington Flat. I hate organised walks or hikes. Abhor
group jollity. Am not a team-player. Prefer my own company.
So I get into my hire car, drive a few miles, stop and get out, walk for 15
minutes in a circle, puff a cigarette, gaze soulfully at the horizon, check
to see if it is raining or if there are mountain lions massing, or a posse
of Mexican bears, or a column of desert tortoises, kill my cigarette
carefully, glance at my map, re-start the car, drive a few miles, stop and
get out . . . until I am bone-weary.
It was because of the strenuousness of these safaris that I spent much of my
time in Palm Springs idling and vegging out.
Michael Thompson-Noel flew to Los Angeles with British Airways, which has
two flights every day, Heathrow-LA, non-stop. Apex fares start at Pounds 324
return. The standard Club World return fare is Pounds 3,254.
In Los Angeles he was a guest of the Biltmore Hotel, and in Palm Springs of
the Marquis Hotel &amp; Villas. Double rooms at the Biltmore cost Dollars
215-Dollars 285 per night. Bookings can be made through Leading Hotels of
the World (UK freephone: 0-800-181-123). In Palm Springs, the Marquis is at
150 South Indian Canyon Drive, tel: (619)-322-2121. Until June 12, and from
September 18 to January 8 1994, double rooms and villas cost Dollars

FT  24 APR 93 / Fashion: Owls and peacocks, a story of opposites - Dressing
for the Professions, The Journalist / The way the Press dress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS IN life, so in dress. Journalists are a duplicitous lot.
Are journalists responsible arbiters of public life, sober, sagacious owls
to whom we can turn for truth and wise opinion? Certainly the serious grey
suits worn in the editor's offices of Britain's national dailies imply that
this is the intention.
Or are journalists media peacocks, prima donnas of the word processor with
egos so attention-seeking that they feel the need to tell us their opinions
of the world? The ghastly polka-dotted bow-tie, the sloppy, rumpled suit,
the flamboyant waistcoat, the questionable socks, macs and ties sometimes
affected by journalists would indicate personal style bordering on the
eccentric.
Owls or peacocks? The answer is: both. Journalism is a world in which
individual expression and social convention have their proper place.
Clothing simply reflects this. More homogeneous professions may have more
homogeneous codes of dress, but journalists' clothes are as different as the
organisations they work for, the topics they cover and the opinions they
hold. A newspaper office is one of the few places where one man in green
velvet and another man in grey pin-stripe have equal value and utility.
Traditionally, journalists have a reputation for being notoriously poor
dressers. Like Lou Reed in his fictional Twin City newsroom, or Walter
Matthau type-writer bashing in the bleachers, they are portrayed as
negligent, sloppy, soup-stained men - in the stop-press world of ringing
telephones, desperate deadlines and the passionate search for truth, there
is no room for the consideration of mere clothing. The hard-nosed hack, his
sleeves rolled up and his tie pulled down, just does not care.
There is probably some real basis for this image, but it is hardly as
romantic as popular myth would have us believe. In the past journalism was
one of the lower-paid professions. Despite the occasional gentleman dandy,
this was a hard-living, hard-drinking, somewhat disreputable calling. For
most work-a-day journalists, salaries did not permit large or expensive
wardrobes - if the few suits a journalist owned all looked ready to retire,
it was because they had seen much active service.
Nor was journalism a tidy profession. When reporters were not in
smoke-filled offices pouring over inky proof-pages, they were out pounding
the sidewalks in all weathers - the basis of that eternal cliche, the
journalist and his wrinkled and dirty mackintosh.
Today, journalists (at least in the larger national publications) are better
paid and can afford to dress as well as others in the liberal professions.
Yet the sloppy, negligent image persists.
As potent as money in the creation of the journalist's persona is social
status, his need to feel and be seen as different. If the attitude looks
unstudied, the absent-minded indifference of the intellectual, it
nonetheless has its purpose.
Looking into the doings of the influential, the wealthy and the celebrated
more often inspires cynicism than admiration. Down-dressing or dressing
differently is a way for the journalist to say to such people: 'I may write
about your world, but I am not of your world. I am different. I am an
observer who evaluates.' To the world at large it is also a modestly
boastful way of saying: 'I do not care about the way I look, I want to be
judged by the superlative way I write'.
But the image of the journalist in cheap, nasty and ill-considered clothing
is probably over-done these days; looking competent and professional, at
least to management, now counts for a good deal in this competitive trade.
In an age of journalistic specialisation, styles are varied and specialised
too. Fashion journalists on women's magazines are fashionably dressed in
discounted designer clothes. Diplomatic correspondents dress diplomatically.
Banking correspondents tend to look like second-drawer bankers. Among the
young thrusters of Third World foreign correspondence, multi-pocketed
sleeveless vests are the sign of literate Rambos ready for action. Press
photographers dress like members of motorcycle clubs, but that too is a
fashion statement. Only sub-editors - journalists with no public face - can
these days emulate the ideals of the journalistic slob.
If journalists are no longer permitted simple unfashionability, which way do
they head? In spite of the great diversity of style, they seem to tend
towards one of two opposing poles: the flamboyant, creative personality, and
the serious, responsible journalist of weight.
John Walsh, editor of The Independent newspaper's weekend magazine, is a
self-avowed peacock. He wears tomato soup-coloured Kenzo jackets with green
shirts. He owns a pair of floral braces. He has a ginger-coloured outfit
from Reiss, and a dark green suit by Christian Dior. His favourite article
of dress is a brocade lame waistcoat which is 7 per cent gold thread. He
usually wears it with a dinner jacket.
'Journalists take themselves far too seriously", he avows. 'This is not a
totally serious profession. All journalists are actors to some extent. Some
like to dress like power brokers or tycoons. But our job is not to be bank
managers. Our job is to be right, and not necessarily to fit in.'
When Walsh was literary editor of the Sunday Times, he used to enjoy teasing
editor Andrew Neil. 'Andrew is an actor, too; he plays the nasty and
horrible role and wears power-broker suits. Whenever we heard he was going
to visit the literary desk, we pulled out coloured Balkan Sobranie cocktail
cigarettes, put on floppy black bow-ties and used lots of words like ennui.
It seemed the suitable corrective.'
But there are plenty of correctives to the individualist, Bohemian streak
among journalists, too. Ivan Fallon, formerly of The Sunday Telegraph and
today business editor of the Sunday Times, sits on the other side of the
fence, not a peacock, but an owl. His own dress is elegantly conservative.
His suits are cut on Savile Row by an Irish tailor, his shirts ordered
hand-made from Hong Kong. He has a weakness for Hermes ties. On Saturdays he
abandons his suit for a blazer.
'We are fairly anonymous in the City of London,' he admits. 'Senior and
financial journalists tend to dress the same as those they interview.' But
it is all to good purpose, he says - journalists do a better job as
political reporters, financial analysts and foreign affairs observers if
they fit into their surroundings without causing undue notice.
'All journalists should express a degree of independence, but not in a way
that is embarrassing', he protests. 'If I were at a board lunch and had
dirty shoes, I would feel uncomfortable.'
But everything has its place. 'John Walsh may appear unconventional to most
people', he laughs. 'but in the circles he moves, the way he dresses is
convention.' Even peacocks have their codes.

FT  24 APR 93 / Bard's muse of fate: Gerald Cadogan invokes the spirit of
Shakespeare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DID William Shakespeare's muse home in on Southwark, south London,
yesterday, for his 429th birthday? If so it might have been a bemused muse.
Shakespeare would have looked at where his wooden O, the Globe, stood (now
Park street) and west across Southwark Bridge Road to Marlowe's Rose. Then
he would wonder why his countrymen who profess to be so proud of him, and
benefit from the tourists he brings the scepter'd isle, leave these two
theatre sites sad and forlorn, when his descendants had the luck to come
upon them a few years back
It is a puzzle. It took an American, Sam Wanamaker, to build a replica of
the Globe slightly to the north-west of both sites. The Globe itself looks
like a bombed site, and the Rose lurks beneath the Rose Court office block
strewn with banners advertising space to let. The archaeology at both sites
is unfinished - at the Globe it has hardly reached the end of the first act.
Yet these are the remains that can tell precisely where the players made
their exits and entrances and where the gravedigger dug in Hamlet, and so
how the plays were played. The only way to learn is by digging them fully.
The Globe was built in 1599, and the lease names Shakespeare as one of the
tenants. It was one of 11 or 12 amphitheatre playhouses built in London
between 1567 and 1614 which gave acting companies permanent homes for the
first time - and are the transition to the indoor theatres we know today. In
1613 a cannonade for the King's entry in Henry VIII caused a fire and the
Globe burnt down. Rebuilt in 1614, it it was finally pulled down in 1644.
Tenements went up on the site, as the archaeologists report* in the account
of the 1989-91 trial dig. They were demolished when Southwark Bridge was
built in 1814-19 and Anchor Terrace (listed Grade II) in 1821. Most of the
Globe lies beneath Southwark Bridge Road and Anchor Terrace.
East of the terrace the diggers found the outer gallery wall and what seems
to be a stair turret, and signs of two phases of building - but it is
unclear which Globe was built first.
With such a small patch excavated, diggers can tell us little more except
that the audience ate hazelnuts and that in Hollar's famous 1630s 'Long
View' drawing, from Southwark Cathedral tower, the building with a stair
turret marked 'beere bayting' is really the Globe, and that marked 'the
Globe' is really the Hope, another theatre. The stage and backbuildings
still await the diggers' trowels, and the site sits idle while Hanson, which
funded the trial digs generously, decides what to do.
Now is the time for Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, to act. Jack-up
Anchor Terrace on piles and dig beneath. Then look under Southwark Bridge
Road. Then arrange to display what is left of the place where the world's
greatest playwright put on his plays. This is our National Heritage - as
nothing else is in the country.
And if you are sceptical, Mr Brooke - though you should not be, as a
longstanding member of the Friends of Friendless Churches and so of the
Ancient Monuments Society - think of our France, always ready to spend money
on its capital city.
Do not forget the Rose. The Rose Theatre Trust has the offer of a grant from
the South Thames TEC to open the site for plays and readings. That will
bring the Rose back to public attention. But it still needs some Pounds
70,000 to prepare plans to conserve the remains permanently, complete the
archaeology and display the theatre, and then much more money to carry out
those plans.
If the Cabinet has doubts, tell them of the economic benefits. Southwark is
bound to boom. It is crammed with history. Here is an opportunity to make a
comprehensive scheme, by world-wide architectural competition, to display it
all as an historic area by the river - and even find a use for Bankside
power station next to the Wanamaker Globe.
If nothing is done, we are left with the diggers' reports - a messengers'
speech of tantalising brevity and a drama without end. Is that the way to
treat this blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England?

FT  24 APR 93 / How To Spend It: Caviar and cashmere - Some real bargains at
duty-free shops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW LONG is it since you last bought something other than the odd bottle of
booze and some spare film at an airport duty-free shop?
If, like me, you arrive with minutes to spare, suitcases packed to the brim
and memories of hearing about shams and rip-offs you probably do not even
think about it. If you are one of the canny ones who has sussed out that
times have changed at airport shops, that duty-free these days really does
mean that then no doubt you shop there all the time.
Certainly enough people visit duty-free outlets to have sent BAA figures
soaring - five years ago retailing brought in Pounds 299m, last year it had
risen 60 per cent to Pounds 480m. Those who supposed that the proper
business of airports was aviation will be intrigued to learn that retailing
now accounts for 32 per cent of total revenue.
A combination of falling revenue from landing fees and rising investment
costs meant that increased revenue had to be found. Gingering up the
duty-free operation seemed an obvious way forward.
Unscrupulous pricing, which lead to an embarrassing number of features in
the national press, had eroded the confidence of the travelling-classes in
'airside' shopping. Today, much of this has changed. The airport shops
between them sell more caviar than the rest of the UK put together. Many
retailers do between Pounds 4,000 and Pounds 5,000 in turnover per sq ft
each year when the average in the UK is nearer Pounds 400 - in other words,
they do 10 times more business than their High Street rivals. Some, like the
Swatch shop in Terminal 4, do even better. It did Pounds 6,500 per sq ft in
its first year, 15 per cent more than the UK average.
The revival started two years ago when Barry Gibson arrived to take over as
group retail director of BAA. Confidence had to be restored. He started with
what he called his 'Value Guarantee Campaign', which guarantees that in the
'land-side' airport shops prices are no higher than they are in UK towns and
cities and that in the 'air-side' shops the prices really are free of duty
and tax.
The result is that today you can be sure of finding most alcohol at half the
price it is in the High Street, tobacco is 40 per cent less, perfumes 21 per
cent, and almost everything else from scarves and ties to shoes, watches,
cashmere sweaters and gadgetry, 17 1/2 per cent cheaper.
Perceived notions, however, take a long time to die, and many travellers
believe it is cheaper to buy in Schipol or Frankfurt airports. Barry Gibson
is adamant that for most things it is hard to beat the prices in BAA shops.
He points out that in some continental countries, Denmark and Germany, for
instance, VAT is still charged in duty-free shops.
A straw poll revealed that his claims held up well. A litre bottle of Bells
whisky sells for Pounds 8.30 in BAA duty-free shops, the equivalent of
Pounds 8.82 in European duty-free shops (calculated by using an average of
prices in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Copenhagen) and Pounds 16.61 in the High
Street. A litre of Johnnie Walker's Red label was marginally more expensive
in BAA shops (Pounds 9.95) than in Europe (Pounds 9.30) but in both places
it was a great deal cheaper than in the High Street where it sells for
nearly double at Pounds 19.90.
An Hermes scarf is Pounds 129 in Hermes town and city shops, Pounds 127 in
Europe and Pounds 110 in BAA duty-free shops. On the perfume front,
Guerlain's Samsara and Dior's Poison were both cheaper in BAA's duty-frees
than anywhere else but unaccountably Chanel No. 5 turned out to cost
slightly more (Pounds 36.30 in BAA shops as opposed to Pounds 34.26 in
Europe and Pounds 46 in the High Street).
So the prices are good but is there anything you actually want? You are not
going to find cute little hand-made items, one-off pieces of art or quirky
presents - what you will find is classic items that cost you less than they
would back home. Many well-known retailers have an outlet somewhere in
Terminal 3 or 4 - Harrods and Burberry, Austin Reed and Hamley's, Mappin &amp;
Webb and Georg Jensen, Ferragamo and Gucci, Cartier and Jaeger - so the
label-loving brigade are well catered-for.
If you need a good watch, hanker for, say, a Cartier three-gold ring, want a
CD player or a camera, need a shirt or a classic pair of shoes, then, if
price matters to you, it may well be worth your while to do some research
before you travel. Try on shoes in a Bally shop, suss out what Jaeger has to
offer, work out which colour cashmere sweater would freshen up your
wardrobe, check out watches and decide which is the one for you.
There remains the vexed question of duty. Foreigners heading home will need
to check on their own customs regulations. UK residents should probably not
buy their Pounds 20,000 Rolex if they are on the way to Hong Kong - it will
have to be declared on the way back and the duty paid. But, if, for
instance, you are going anywhere in Europe, now that barriers are down, you
can buy in the duty-free and do not have to declare anything on your way
back in.

FT  24 APR 93 / How To Spend It: A serious frame-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE apogee of the Royal Academy's Year is, of course, the Summer Exhibition
(this year starting on June 6 and running until August 15) with the
vernissage a must for assiduous pursuers of the society round. But there are
lots of other reasons for visiting the RA, not least one of its best-kept
secrets - a framing shop tucked away near the back entrance in what looks
like an old mews or stable.
Now that every museum or gallery has cottoned on to the fact that there is
money to be made out of ancillary commercial enterprises many are branching
into new fields. But for The Royal Academy, the framing shop is no bright
new venture, rather a well-established service that in its present form has
been going for eight years but under previous ownership was started
something like 40 years ago.
It has long been known among the many artists exhibiting at the RA and many
London dealers, such as Agnews and the New Grafton Gallery, use it all the
time. The pity is that it is so little-known by the public.
The shop is run by David Nelson and Edith Robertson and tucked away in the
warren-like series of rooms is a specialist team of craftsmen and gilders.
Piled high with frames, mounts and pictures it has the air of a busy,
old-fashioned atelier, occupied by serious and skilled craftsmen
specialising in quality work. It is not the place to go for a cheap-jack
solution to framing a poster - more the place to go for expert advice, for
quality frames, for conservation advice and treatments.
This means it is by no means the cheapest place to get your pictures framed
 -quality mounts and materials do not come cut-price. Conservation is high
on the agenda and all the materials used help to ensure that works are
properly protected from ultra-violet light, humidity, insects and air
pollutants. The choice of frames is vast - everything from simple wood and
metal to ornate hand-gilded numbers.
Besides framing, the workshop will also restore, clean and repair pictures
or frames. It is a friendly place which anybody going to an exhibition might
like to look into just in case they need a better class of frame.
The Framing Shop's entrance is in Burlington Gardens, next to the Museum of
Mankind. Otherwise use the RA's main entrance in Piccadilly.

FT  24 APR 93 / How To Spend It: The Kenyan art of bribery - Rex Winsbury
tells the chilling tale of how he imported an ice-cream machine to make his
wife feel at home in Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REX WINSBURY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I LEARNT my lesson about how to do business in Kenya on the day, some four
months after I had arrived there as an ex-pat manager, that my wife and two
children flew in to Kenyatta Airport to join me. When my wife resigned from
her job in London, her colleagues threw a party and gave her, as a leaving
present, a small ice-cream maker.
My wife rang from London and said: 'You don't mind if I ship out my leaving
present, do you, by air freight?' - at my expense of course. I could hardly
say no. I did not even know what the present was, but the principle was
important. She had been doubtful about coming out to Kenya, leaving her job
and friends in London, and I did not want to imperil the fragile
understanding at the last moment.
So I said 'yes' and, the afternoon before they were due to arrive off a KLM
flight at Kenyatta Airport, I had a telephone call from our clearing agent
at the airport to say that a package had arrived for me, and I had better go
to the freight terminal to get it.
Innocently, I decided to collect my wife and children first, and then stop
to pick up the goods. They were due at 7 am the next morning, and it sounded
a logical plan. So much for western logic.
Their arrival was uneventful. As we left the passenger terminal I said
proudly, as if to confirm their welcome: 'And what's more, your packet has
arrived. what is it?'
'An ice-cream maker.'
I still did not sense trouble. No one had warned me about the freight
terminal. We drove to a large building on the airport perimeter. I parked
the ageing company Range Rover and with an innocent: 'See you in a few
minutes,' went to find Hassan, the clearing agent.
Or rather, he found me. He had been waiting, and knew the vehicle of old. He
took me into a dingy side office and said: 'You are late.'
He led me into a huge aircraft-hangar-like depot with an ante-room where
sundry Kenyans were shouting and gesticulating at each other. In the middle
of the floor of this ante-room was a large cardboard box, opened, with bits
of its contents on the floor beside it. It was my wife's packet.
'They say you will have to pay duty,' said Hassan.
'But it's a present, and it's for our own use, like our other belongings. We
have just arrived in Kenya.'
'Here, an ice cream machine is counted as an industrial machine, it says so
in the customs manual.'
'How much duty?'
'Maybe 8,000 shillings.'
I began to get annoyed; 8,000 Kenya shillings was worth about Pounds 300.
The machine had only cost about Pounds 200 in London.
'I won't pay that much,' I told Hassan, trying to sound every bit the
authoritative white man who will stand no nonsense from the blacks.
Hassan looked at me sorrowfully, took me by the arm and steered me outside
again. 'You must realise that if you do not pay, they will leave it there on
the floor, like that. And if it is left there, it will not be there at all
by the morning.'
I knew what he meant. Theft was rife in Nairobi, and I could well imagine
its mysterious nocturnal disappearance, with nothing the next morning except
shrugs of the shoulders. My wife and children were waiting outside. what
would I say to her if her leaving present was stolen? What sort of welcome
would that be to Kenya? The matter began to assume symbolic proportions.
'What do you suggest?' I asked Hassan. 'You are the expert here.'
He paused, and looked into the half-distance. 'Maybe, for 4,000 shillings I
can do it for you. Come back later with money.'
I was in a fix. I agreed to be back at noon with money. I rushed back to my
impatient jetlagged family and took them home. I telephoned the office,
arranged to have the money ready at my office, drove into town to collect
it, then back to the airport freight terminal for midday.
'The terminal is shut now,' said Hassan solemnly.
'What for?'
'Lunch.'
'So what do we do now?'
'Have lunch.'
We went to the airport canteen, a greasy self-service cafeteria reminiscent
of British Rail in the 1950s. He chose a large meal, I chose a small one. He
left me to pay the bill.
Then I had to sit with him for an hour, a total stranger, one white man in a
black canteen, everyone knowing why I was there. Finished, he sucked his
teeth, and said: 'OK, go now.'
Back at the terminal building, he led me along sunless corridors and from
one office to another, bypassing queues of people. In each office he nodded
vigorously to the occupant in my direction. I suppose he was doling out my
money - dishing out verbal promissory notes.
It seemed to work. Hassan led me back to the ante-chamber of the transit
hall. There, my package had already been taped together, and the overseer
gesticulated towards it. 'OK, you take it now,' he said with a wide grin. I
knew why he was grinning.
Hassan made no gesture to help me. I picked up the heavy cardboard box and
staggered outside, into the bright sunlight of a Nairobi afternoon. I was
dazzled, breathing in fresh air, glad to be free of the claustrophobic
atmosphere. But I was pulled sharply back to business.
'Now, you must give me the money. I have promised it.'
'All of it?' I felt like a baby in his hands.
'Yes, you see, their view is that you will sell that machine, tomorrow or
maybe the day after, it doesn't matter, for a good profit. So they think
they should have part of that profit. Not all of it. You have your share,
they have theirs, for letting you bring it in without paying duty.'
There was an African logic about that. I counted out 4,000 shillings in 100
shilling notes. He stared at the notes for many seconds, not taking them.
Then he asked: 'what about me?'
I stared back at him.
'I have done my part. So you must pay me too.'
I was beginning to get angry. He was breaking the agreement between us. I
felt a righteous anger - and I was in possession of the goods.
'How much?'
'What you think is fair. I did you a service.'
He had got lunch off me, and the company paid him for his services. So I
said, as much to get rid of him as anything else, 'Four hundred shillings.'
Ten per cent seemed a reasonable tip.
'That is not very much.'
'Four hundred.'
'OK.'
So I counted out four more notes, and he took the pile, shook my hand, and
vanished into the building.
My troubles were not over. The man on guard at the gate, dressed in dirty
overalls, said: 'where are going with that thing? where is your pass?'
Of course, I did not have one. But by now, I knew the game. I put the
package down, pulled 40 shillings (10 per cent of 10 per cent) out of my
pocket and handed it over as I walked past him. He grinned, and I was free
at last.
I thought my wife would be pleased. But she was furious.
'I wouldn't have paid all that for it,' she said. 'Let 'em have it or send
it back to England.'
But we did sell it, three years later, for 4,500 shillings. So we broke
even. Except the ice cream wasn't up to much.

FT  24 APR 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A meaty encounter - Bookshelf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By A C GRAYLING

<TEXT>
WHY NOT eat meat? None of the stuff has passed my lips for years, yet the
aroma of roast beef still charms, as does the memory of bacon crisped on a
primus stove. But three different vegetarian arguments persuade me, each
convincing enough on its own but together overwhelming: arguments which
respectively conclude that meat eating is cruel, unhealthy, and uneconomic.
It is uneconomic because ten acres of land can feed 24 people if planted
with wheat, but only two people if applied to cattle grazing. And
rainforests are being cleared at a frightening rate to make room for beef
cattle to supply hamburger chains.
It is unhealthy because meat is full of saturated fat. Meat is decaying
animal matter.
It is cruel not merely because farming techniques and slaughterhouses make
it so, but because killing a sentient creature as a matter not of need but
of taste is morally repugnant. (How many of us could slit a cow's throat
ourselves?).
A newspaper report tells of a common practice among British farmers. A type
of lowland sheep has been selectively bred for two characteristics:
smallness, so that it eats less; and a genetic inclination to have twins or
triplets. But when a ewe has a single lamb, the lamb is too big to be born.
So its front limbs are amputated in the womb to protect the ewe. Before this
year's lambing season is over 50,000 lambs will have died this way.
Colin Spencer's handsomely comprehensive history of vegetarianism (The
Heretic's Feast Fourth Estate, Pounds 20, 402 pages) shows that from the
earliest times one or other of these reasons has persuaded many to forgo
meat. But other reasons have prevailed too, chiefly religious ones.
In a continuing tradition from antiquity to the present there have been
significant minorities of people who shared similar views. Ovid was
disgusted by animal slaughter; Plutarch was a vegetarian, as was Leonardo da
Vinci.
England's most carnivorous hour was reached in the 18th century, and
descriptions of the way animals were then treated reads like a horror story.
Pigs, calves and poultry were whipped to death to tenderise the flesh. Geese
were nailed to the floor to fatten.
Sheep were killed by slow bleeding to improve the eating quality of their
meat. 'I know nothing more shocking or horrid,' wrote Alexander Pope, 'than
the prospect of kitchens covered with blood and filled with the cries of
creatures expiring in tortures.'
Wartime rationing in the 1940s improved the nation's health because of a
shift of emphasis from meat to vegetables and grains. It is an oddity that
so few set this fact against the reeking floor of the slaughterhouse, and
draw the obvious conclusion.
Looking at history from a seat at its dinner table is fascinating; one sees
aspects of it quite absent from the sober-sided chronicles of kings and
battles which usually march us through the ages.
Spencer's book tells a fascinating story, and tells it well. It will move
honest readers to ponder carefully what lies on the next dinner plate they
encounter.

FT  24 APR 93 / Food &amp; Drink: It needn't be so pricy - Eating out in Venice
/ Where to eat in La Serenissima
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
VENICE IS an expensive city. This is not just because over the centuries
they have gained an unsurpassed experience in the art of fleecing
foreigners, it is also expensive for Venetians.
Everything has to be transported by boat, which means that transport costs
often exceed the value of the object itself. There is no storage space as
there are no cellars. This does not mean that Venetians are justified in
robbing everyone who visits their city, but there are mitigating
circumstances.
It is still possible to spend a week in Venice without taking out a second
mortgage. I have seen little trattorie in Cannaregio, behind the railway
station, which serve menus for as little as L14,000 (Pounds 6), although I
cannot imagine that the food is anything to write home about, and they
certainly will not stay open late.
Food is simple. Gone are the days when Venice was noted for elaborate
displays of culinary theatre which pleased the Doges. Now the emphasis is on
fresh fish and seafood with a few stock dishes such as fegato alla
Veneziana, calves' liver on a bed of onions sweated in oil, served with the
ineluctable hunk of polenta.
If you are on a tight budget, one solution is pizza. Pizzas are not
typically Venetian, but there are plenty of restaurants in the city which
offer them because they appeal to tourists of slender means. One reasonable
pizza place is the Trattoria Pizzeria due Colonne in San Polo which has a
list of about 30 including one topped with different cuts of horse meat.
With a jug of the thin house wine you may get away with under Pounds 10.
Another recommendation for a cheap, light meal is Vino Vino in San Marco, a
bar near the Fenice with a stunning wine list. A plate of pasta followed by
some polpette (meat balls) can be had for as little as L14,000. Expect to
pay much more if you stray away from the house wine.
They say that Vino Vino stays open till 1 am. In my experience they remain
open until the particularly graceless waiter decides he wants to go home.
Venice has a largely retired population and they go to bed early. One
solution for princes of darkness is Haig's Bar by Santa Maria del Giglio in
San Marco. By night it fills up with all Venice's more elegant insomniacs.
If you desire more authentically Venetian food at reasonable prices, the
Taverna San Trovaso is popular both with locals and better-heeled tourists.
They appear more gracious here than in some places. The food is stock
Venetian which does not mean desperately exciting: spaghetti with cuttle
fish; fritto misto, a collection of shrimps, Dublin Bay prawns and squid
rings in batter, for example. With a large jug of Sauvignon blanc it comes
to about Pounds 20 a head.
Similar, but even more popular with locals, is Trattoria della Madonna near
the Rialto bridge. The style here is brash, cheeky and sometimes downright
unco-operative. But, at around Pounds 25 a head, it is hardly expensive by
London standards. Fresh fish is the thing here: ivory-white cigale di mare
(literally sea grasshoppers - they look a little like Dublin Bay prawns and
come from the Adriatic); spider crab; castraure, baby artichokes; which fish
soup, which is a meal in itself; and cuttle fish or calves' liver with
polenta. It is a busy, pretty restaurant with white walls and exposed beams.
Rather more up-market is La Corte Sconta (the hidden courtyard) in Castello
by the Arsenal. It is important to book. A jolly, red-headed woman speaking
idiomatically fluent English tells you what to eat: 'I will send you some
mixed antipasti and a turbot. You won't need the pasta course.'
She was right. A carpaccio of salmon in Tuscan olive oil came with pots of
buttery spider crab mousse; next came vongolex clams; a spider crab dressed
with oil and lemon in its shell a plate of octopus, winkles, squid and
shrimps, two sorts of anchovies and stuffed mussels; two sorts of polenta
one with baccala (an emulsion of dried cod) the other with sardines with
onions and pine nuts; then came the turbot. A still prosecco is put on your
table, but there is also an extensive wine list. About Pounds 35 to Pounds
40 a head.
For your last night in Venice you cannot do much better than the terrace at
the Danieli. The view is stunning. Taking in with one broad sweep the domes
of the Salute, San Giorgio Maggiore and the Zitelle as well as the Lido.
The food is no disappointment either: a marinated sea bass with onions was
surprisingly effective; mixed antipasti came with cigale di mare, prawns,
octopus, spider crab and mussels; then a superb risotto with scampi and
rocket.
The main course was a John Dory with a sauce of finely chopped herbs,
tomatoes and gherkins. The Daniel is expensive - even by London standards:
about Pounds 60 a head.

FT  24 APR 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Hold fire on the 1992 claret vintage -
Well-made '92s should be good from '96 onwards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the second year in succession, the 1992 red Bordeaux was dismissed
before the grapes were picked. As Peter Sichel, of Angludet and Palmer, says
in his annual vintage and market report: 'It provided the wettest summer for
at least 50 years with the fewest hours of sunshine since 1980. But those
properties that had sprayed regularly, cut off a large proportion of grapes
in July, and selected severely, produced good Merlot and at least healthy if
not very ripe Cabernet.'
Aided by new concentration techniques, a vintage that would have been
declared a disaster 30 years ago will yield a fair proportion of drinkable
wines from a record crop of 5.03 million hl. Generally they are superior to
the frost-devastated 1991's.
The dry white wines, picked before the September rains, are generally
excellent when not over-oaked, but the sweet types had little success as the
bad weather continued in the autumn.
The Union des Grands Crus, which represents 120 classed growths and others
with internaitonal market potentialities, has just held a three-day tasting
of the new wines. The first-growths are not members or do not show their
wines at these tastings, and this applies to several of the leading
second-growths. However, I was able to taste all these in their cellars,
with the exception of Leoville Las-Cases that had yet to offer them.
I have included those sampled in the district lists below. It must be said
that many of the wines were difficult to taste, as they had not settled
after the assemblage (the blend of each chateau's grape varieties to provide
the best balance).
Others needed racking (taking the wine off the lees and into fresh barrels),
or may have already only just done so. However the union's tastings provided
wine writers with a controlled opportunity to compare the wines before the
opening prices appear. Thanks to Latour I was able to visit all the
first-growths except Ausone and Petrus, which only offers its wines through
the associated merchant house of J-P Moueix. The wines of those firsts which
also own other chateaux, and which I tasted and picked out, are included in
the district lists below. The growths that appealed to me, with my
particular preferences, are starred (*). The number tasted in each area are
noted.
The tastings started with Pomerols and St Emilions, continued with the
southern and northern Medocs; then the Graves and finally the Barsacs and
Sauternes. In general I found the Merlot-dominated Pomerols and St. Emilions
more fruity and better structured than some of the Medocs, especially in the
southern communes, and too many were over-oaked to mask their limitations.
But variability is the keynote word to describe the 1992 vintage.
Pomerol (10) Beauregard*, La Cabanne, La Conseillante, La Croix de Gay,
Gazin*, Petit Village*.
St Emilion (16) Angelus*, Balestard la Tonnelle, Clos Fourtet, Larcis
Ducasse, Larmande*, Pavie, Trolong Mondot*, Villemaurine.
Southern Medoc (28). Moulis - Chass-Spleen, Poujeaux. Listrac - Clarke*.
Haut-Medoc - Cantemerle*. Margaux - Angludet, Durfort Vivens, Malescot,
Pavillon Rouge de Ch Margaux, Rausan-Segla* (I confess to being disappointed
with my usually favoured Palmer, but these are early days).
Northern Medocs (28) St Julien - Ducru-Beaucaillou*, Gruaud Larose *,
Langoa-Barton Leoville Barton*, Pauillac - Grand-Puy-Ducasse, Grand Puy
Lacoste*, Lynch-Bages*, Pichon Baron, Pichon Lalande*. St Estephe - Cos
Labory, Montrose*, Ormes de Pez.
Red Graves (17) Pessac-Leognan - Carbonnieux, Domaine de Chevalier,
Haut-Berger, Malartique Lagraviere, La Mission-Haut-Brion, Pape Clement*.
White Graves (13) Pessac-Leognan - Carbonnieux*, Domaine de Chevalier*,
Larrivet-Haut-Brion*, Malartic Lagraviere, Olivier, Smith-Haut-Lafitte.
Portets (2) - Rahoul.
Barsac/Sauternes (16). Barsac - Doisy-Vedrines*, Nairac. Sauternes -
Lafaurie-Peyrguey - Rieussec.
A number of union members did not show their wines, notably Evangile in
Pomerol.
First growths (6). All save Cheval-Blanc also showed their 1991, and I
attach my notes. In the order tasted in their cellars: Mouton-Rothchild  -
deep colour, very closed on nose and palate; very hard to taste at present,
a bit short ('91 distinguished bouquet, tannic but good balance of fruit).
Lafite - deep colour, elegant nose, very closed but not much body evident;
light but good style ('91 full colour, elegant, fine nose. Oaky on taste but
should develop good balance.)
Latour - huge colour, velvety taste and plenty of body, long in the mouth
('91 less body and fruit than '92, fairly oaky, typical Pauillac).
Margaux - big colour closed nose, good flavour but hard to taste, somewhat
short at present ('91 - fine colour, good aroma, a claret of real class,
comparatively long).
Haut-Brion excellent colour, closed nose, light on taste, but sweet and
surprisingly fruity for the year ('91 - more tannic in '92, more body,
should develop well).
Cheval Blanc - lovely blackcurrant bouquet, rich flavour, long, typical of
this near Pomerol wine, and my favourite, followed by Latour and Haut-Brion.
Early indications are that en primeur prices will be well down for the first
growths, at the level of the 1987's - once despised, now sought after for
current drinking. First-growth collectors apart, there is no good reason for
claret amateurs to buy the 1992's before they are in bottle in two years'
time.
Those made well should make good drinking from 1996 onwards. Available cash
will be better spent in acquiring '88's, 89's and 90's, said to lie in
considerable quantities in the Medoc, less in the Graves, but not in St
Emilion and Pomerol. What Bordeaux needs is a small but fine, highly
saleable 1993, but we will have to wait another five or six months to find
out if this will turn up.

FT  24 APR 93 / Cookery: Just perfect partners - Why duck needs a contrast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   DINING BY candlelight is a common enough experience
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
but harvesting one's supper by torchlight is different. I have done it only
once, on an East Anglian farm, or to be more precise a vast hangar of a shed
standing on an island of concrete slabs set in a Constable landscape.*
Blanched chicory needs to be deprived of light. The traditional way is to
cover it with straw or forcing pots as it pushes its way through the soil.
The modern factory farm solution is to grow chicory in the darkness of a
computer-controlled hydroponic shed.
It was eerie to see the chicons in the beam of a torch as they lay, ghostly
pale and shoulder to shoulder, in their bunk-like beds. These were, in fact,
shelves stretching the length of the shed through which nutrient-bearing
waters were pumped.
In fact we could have made the inspection blindfolded. Growing progress can
be gauged largely by sound, apparently. As the plants grow their little
rootlets gradually form a thicker and thicker mat through which the water
flows, and the sound of running water changes accordingly.
Chicory grown this way lacks some of the bitterness traditionally associated
with this vegetable, bitterness which is fundamental to its character and is
part of its charm for some. This chicory was blander and fatter. Eaten
within a couple of hours of picking it was juicy and supremely crisp.
DUCK WITH CHICORY, HONEY AND LIME (serves 2) The chicory follows the duck
into the pan in this recipe, so the leaves are deliciously anointed with
duck fat and pick up meaty sediment. Maybe my servings of chicory are a
little generous.
There might be enough for four if you wanted to serve the dish for a party,
but in that case the chicory would be reduced to the role of a garnish
rather than served as vegetable proper. Chicory cooked in this way also goes
well with grilled pork chops.
For two people, you will need 10 to 12 oz of duck breast fillet, either one
large magret cut diagonally in half to make two portions, or two breasts
from a smaller bird.
As for the chicory, I suggest 10 oz prepared weight. Buy more to allow for
trimming away the solid root end and any bruised or wilted parts. Separate
each chicon into individual leaves, in so far as you can. The centres are
too tightly furled to pull apart with your fingers, so slice them thinly.
You will also need: 1 teaspoon of finely chopped ginger root, 1 tablespoon
of freshly squeezed lime juice, a sprig of mint, and a scant 2 teaspoons
runny honey. (Stand the jar in a bowl of hot water so it will be easy to
measure when you want it.)
Heat a heavy frying or saute pan and fry the duck gently. Cook it skin side
down most of the time to render the fat and to avoid toughening the flesh. A
total of 10-12 minutes gentle cooking should produce meat that is tender and
faintly pink in the centre.
When done to your liking, transfer the duck to a low oven to rest and pour
off all but 1 tablespoon of fat (save it for frying croutons or potatoes).
Away from the heat, stir the honey and lime juice into the fat remaining in
the pan.
Add the ginger and chicory and quickly place the pan over medium-low heat.
Cook, stirring and turning the leaves quite frequently, for about five
minutes until thoroughly wilted and lightly caramelised.
Carve the duck into slices and lay it on the chicory with its juices poured
over. Scatter with torn mint leaves and serve with steamed basmati rice.

FT  24 APR 93 / As They Say in Europe: Rough ride for le style - Is the EBRD
a victim of British philistinism?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Bank for Reconstruction and Development is starting its annual
meeting in London amid some controversy about alleged over-spending. The
recriminations have annoyed French staff members, who see local reaction as
typical philistinism. Thus, Pierre Pissaloux, the budget director, told Le
Monde: 'The characteristics of modernity and elegance are not to be found
among British attitudes.'
How right he is. I had been struck by the same thought at the end of our
summer holiday last year when we visited the early-Gothic cathedral at
Coutances, in Normandy. It is not as stylish as Chartres, nor as awesome as
Amiens, but it is a fine place with a magnificent organ (which was in use to
prepare for a recital).
We emerged with the early-evening sun dappling the plane trees in the
cathedral square. Through the fine-spun tracery of the leaves, we could pick
out easily the two sets of heavy-duty electricity cable, hugging the boughs
like honeysuckle, leaping from trunk to trunk. Every now and again, echoing
almost perfectly the grey of the stone and the form of the windows of the
nave, a loudspeaker was lashed to a tree. From these, the last notes of the
toccata ringing in our ears, we heard the final phrase of an announcement on
a local radio station of the huge savings available on certain items if one
were shrewd enough to buy them now from Prisunic.
That was succeeded by a ballad from a heavy metal group, the members of
which were so aroused by the sight of a certain maiden that they could not
desist from repeating forcefully their innermost desires.
My wife observed that such a striking counterpoint of sacred and secular
could not have occurred at Winchester or Wells, and I replied: 'Ah yes, if
only we shared the modern and elegant attitude of the French.'
It is probably the Pounds 750,000 marble wall at the EBRD that has attracted
most comment. This wall is rough at one end and becomes smoother gradually,
to achieve perfection at the other. The intention is to symbolise the
transition of the bank's clients from rough-hewn post-communism to the
seamless web of affluence that characterises western society today. The
bank's boss Jacques Attali admitted that this 'might have been done
differently'. But Pissaloux said to Le Monde: 'It might shock, seem bizarre,
and it might not have been done, but it was necessary to create a unity of
style.'
That struck another chord. When I was central Europe correspondent a decade
ago, I visited a couple of dissidents, whom I shall call Peter and Anna, in
Prague. He had just made his almost-daily visit to the central police
station. A year before, he had emerged from nine years' incarceration in an
unheated north Moravian castle where he had been beaten periodically by
someone the communists employed to convince dissidents of the error of their
ways.
I recall sitting in the cramped kitchen-cum-living room as Peter talked of
his vision of Czechoslovak socialism and how far it was from the reality. In
my ensuing account of our evening, I failed to convey what Pissaloux would
call the 'disunity of style' - none of the furniture matched. The sheer
'roughness' of the occasion was marked by Peter's signal that it was at an
end: 'I wish to be alone with my family now.'
To return, however, to the original problem - the British shortage of
elegant modernity. This is a reflection of a national concept of style which
was illustrated brilliantly recently when a bloke in his dad's bowler hat
tried to flag down 30 stampeding horses with a short stick, around which was
a tightly-furled red flag.
It was called the Grand National, and the British thought it proved to the
world just what was wrong with Britain. The fiasco was, it was alleged,
noted around the globe. This is nonsense: outside the UK, it made little
impact. Even in Slovakia.
I mention that because the occasion was graced by a heavy Slovak nag,
Quirinus, priced at 250-1, on which I had a couple of quid each way because
it had won the Velka Pardubicka, a race which makes the Grand National look
like a village gymkhana. Only one Slovak paper carried an extensive report
of the shambles. But it struck an original note in that it blamed the
jockeys for what had gone wrong. On closer reading, it emerged that these
unsophisticated central Europeans had misunderstood the nature of the Jockey
Club, which runs British racing.
The west has clearly under-estimated how far the benighted peoples of the
former communist world have yet to evolve. They do not understand that the
Jockey Club is a club from which jockeys are barred. And they believe that a
bank exists for the benefit of its customers.

FT  24 APR 93 / Minding Your Own Business: An eye on the big earners -
Nicholas Garnett meets a man who makes money from executives pay packets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARE Britain's directors and senior managers greedy? The Institute of
Management thinks many are. It dished out strong criticism in a report this
week on recent management pay rises. This was the latest side swipe from
those uneasy about the rise of top people's pay and benefits in inverse
ratio to the declining performance of the companies they run.
Peter Brown, who has quickly built a successful little company advising on
directors' remuneration packages says some of this criticism is justified.
But he is keen to tell you what his company does not do.
'We are not called in to act as a bludgeon on the remuneration of company
directors. That is not what we do at all.' His company, the Top Pay Research
Group probably would not get any contracts if it did.
Brown's business methods are somewhat softer and more sophisticated than a
mallet.
'We are hired, often by non-executive directors to advise on whether
remuneration policies in a particular company are appropriate and suggest
alternatives on a range of things if we think that is required. We have
never felt it necessary to recommend pay reductions but on a few occasions
we suggested a freeze.'
In its first year to November 1991, Top Pay Research earned a total fee
income of just Pounds 21,000 but in the next 16 months to March this year,
the company made Pounds 130,000. Overheads are low, Brown takes a reasonable
salary and the company makes a pre-tax return of 30 per cent.
At 57, Brown is a one of a breed of entrepreneurs more common in the US than
in Britain. He is chairman of one largish library supply company, and a
board member of a non-quoted chemicals company. He set up Top Pay Research
as his own business which he runs part time.
'It is much more common in the US for people at the top of large companies
to have their own businesses that they run alongside their other roles.'
The parallel is not quite exact because Brown joined the library supply
company when it purchased a remuneration surveys operation Brown had set up
in the 1970s.
Top Pay Research uses a small office in central London, Brown's wife,
Rosemary, works as the researcher, there is a tiny secretarial staff and
three consultants who visit client companies carrying out assessments. They
are paid by Brown on freelance rates of Pounds 250 to Pounds 400 a day.
'I thought there was a niche for this type of business. We did a lot of
research and a lot of marketing to potential clients without at the start
getting companies to say yes but many eventually did.' The Top Pay Research
spends some Pounds 6,000 a year on promotion.
Brown's company was given a fillip early on by support from an initiative by
the Confederation of British Industry and the Bank of England to encourage
the use of non-executive directors and by last year's report by the
committee on financial aspects of corporate governance chaired by Sir Adrian
Cadbury.
Top Pay Research has worked for about 30 clients, including Smith and
Nephew, Welsh Water and National Westminster Bank. The little company
accepts contracts ranging from advice on whether it would be out of line
with the rest of a particular industry if a chief executive were given a 7
rather than a 5-series BMW, to the level of overall directors pay and the
suitability of share option and bonus schemes. This is largely done using
remuneration information from businesses in similar sectors.
'In general, companies are happy to give us comparative information on this
because they know they will not be mentioned individually in any report and
that we do not keep records of this information on computer so they have no
fear it will be spun off into a general database. In this business you must
have the ability to get people to share information with you.'
Individual pieces of work vary from Pounds 400 to Pounds 8,000 and the
company has two retainers, the largest one of Pounds 13,000 a year.
Half the company's inquiries come from chief executives and personnel
directors, the rest from companies' in-house remuneration committees and
their non-executive directors.
'We have to satisfy ourselves that our work will go to someone who will not
directly benefit from it. That is the crux.' A quarter of inquiries are over
pay rates for non-executive directors but the bulk centres on salaries,
bonuses, pensions, share options and benefit packages for executive
directors.
'There is often genuine uncertainty over remuneration packages. Some
companies are concerned that their chief executives might be asking for too
much. Sometimes the question is whether a package is structured correctly.'
Share options which have gone 'under water' - the share price has plummeted
 -are one fruitful area of Brown's work in which managers seek to reactivate
incentives through new bonus systems, including parallel or so-called
'phantom' option schemes.
'Share price is not a very objective measure of performance,' says Brown,
who is critical of over-dependence on this as a gauge for directors'
bonuses. Incentives should be tied more to use of assets, accumulated
profits and market share, he argues.
Meshing two pay cultures when companies merge is another source of
contracts. Brown acknowledges that when it comes to pay this 'meshing' is
always upwards.
Outside consultants on remuneration play an important role, Brown says.
'There must be harmony on company boards and one of the easiest ways of
damaging that is to question each other's remuneration direct.'
Brown says Top Pay Research's target is an annual fee income of Pounds
700,000 within another four years from about 100 clients. If that happens it
will come from using the knowledge of which side his bread is buttered.
'You are not going to tell your clients what they don't want to know. What
is the point of telling them to cut pay if that will not work. We give
practical not other-worldly advice.'

FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Old-fashioned excellence - Investment
Trusts / A Scottish fund that offers an above-average yield
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECURITIES Trust of Scotland is an old-fashioned international trust and
none the worse for it. Founded in 1889, it had an excellent record in the
1980s and still offers private investors an above-average yield - 5.1 per
cent - on a diversified portfolio.
This decade inevitably is proving more difficult for STS which, early in the
1980s, committed itself to a policy of income growth at a time when
generalist trusts were seeking ways to differentiate themselves in the face
of coolness from the institutional investor sector.
UK companies increased their dividends substantially in the 1980s, and funds
such as STS reaped the benefit. But the 1990s' recession has hit companies'
dividend-paying ability and this has fed through eventually to the
investment trust sector.
In each of the past two years, STS has paid a final dividend that has not
been covered fully by its earnings. Trusts build up revenue reserves so they
can cope with just this kind of cyclical downturn; and STS says it can
maintain its dividend from reserves for another three years even if earnings
do not grow from their present level.
It will be a while before shareholders again enjoy the phenomenal dividend
growth achieved during the 1980s - the payout quintupled between 1982 and
1992 - but the assets, at least, continue to grow. This week, the trust
announced that net assets per share rose 20.5 per cent to 84.5p in the
second half of the financial year.
STS is managed by the Edinburgh-based Martin Currie, which assumed
responsibility in 1972. Michael Gibson, who has worked for Martin Currie
since 1982, is in charge of the management team.
Asset allocation policy is decided by the board following recommendations
from Gibson and his number two, Tim Hall. They then supervise its
implementation by specialist geographical teams.
The portfolio's geographical split at the end of March was UK (69 per cent),
US (15 per cent), Hong Kong (6 per cent) and continental Europe (8 per
cent). STS also has a tiny holding in Japan, mainly in warrants, but Gibson
says dividends are too low there to meet the trust's income growth criteria.
During 1991 and 1992, STS had heavy holdings of convertibles and
high-yielding preference shares because of the difficult economic
conditions. By the middle of last year, though, it had begun to switch into
lower-yielding equities that can produce above-average dividend growth.
The 10 largest holdings at the end of March were BT, Shell, British Gas,
BAT, Allied-Lyons, GEC, Macdonald Martin, Bass, Commercial Union and Hanson.
The only non-Footsie stock among these is Macdonald Martin, which produces
Glenmorangie whisky.
The performance of STS is a good illustration of how a well-managed
international trust can be very profitable for private investors over the
long term. The trust is top of the sector over seven years, with growth of
164.1 per cent (mid-market to mid-market with net income re-invested),
according to Finstat. It is second in the sector over both three and five
years.
But the international income sector is very small, so a more relevant
statistic is that STS has outperformed substantially both the FT-A All-Share
index and the investment trust sector over the past 10 years.
Stephen Magrath, analyst at NatWest Securities, says STS 'has not
compromised its capital performance by going all out for yield. It is an
attractive investment for someone who is conscious of total return - a 5 per
cent yield with international exposure looks appealing.'
Lewis Aaron, of SG Warburg Securities, adds: 'In the short term the trust's
record has not been outstanding, but over the long term its performance has
proved the effectiveness of the high-yield strategy. With its high yield,
the trust would probably be a good choice for a personal equity plan.'
Key facts
At the end of March, the trust's net assets were Pounds 273m and the gross
assets Pounds 310m. On April 20, NatWest Securities estimated the nav per
share at 83.6p - putting the shares, at 81.5p, in a discount of 2.8 per
cent. The yield was 5.1 per cent. Martin Currie's annual management fee was
0.35 per cent.
Board
Bill Morrison, the chairman, is a former chief executive of Scottish Life.
Other directors are David Birrell, senior partner of lawyers Dundas &amp;
Wilson; Richard Cole-Hamilton, former chief executive of Clydesdale Bank;
Ian Macpherson, chairman of both Watson &amp; Philip and Low &amp; Bonar; Ronald
Miller, executive chairman of Dawson International; Alick Rankin, chairman
of Scottish &amp; Newcastle; and Michael Kennedy, chief executive of Martin
Currie.
Savings scheme and Pep details
The minimum investment in the savings scheme is Pounds 20 a month, or Pounds
200 for a lump sum. There are no charges (except stamp duty) for buying but
there is a Pounds 10 charge for selling. For a Pep, Martin Currie imposes an
initial fee of Pounds 50, with an annual charge of Pounds 60 at Pounds 5 a
month. Subsequent investments, or withdrawals, cost Pounds 20.

FT  24 APR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Refund of tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY WIFE inherited a warden-controlled retirement flat from her mother in
September 1990. We valued it for probate at Pounds 90,000 but the Inland
Revenue re-valued it at Pounds 95,000 and levied inheritance tax at 40 per
cent.
We sold the flat for Pounds 82,000 in January 1993 and are claiming a refund
of tax on this difference of Pounds 12,500. Are we justified in this claim?
Irrespective of whether it succeeds, can my wife use this loss of Pounds
12,500 to offset gains made on sale of shares etc?
We confirm that the inheritance tax legislation enables one, in the
calculation of an IHT liability, to substitute the sale proceeds for the
probate value if the property is sold at a loss within three years of death.
As your mother-in-law died in September 1990 and the property was sold in
January 1993, the relief might be available.
A refund of IHT pursuant to this relief depends upon a valid claim being
made by 'the appropriate person' - in this case, the person liable for the
IHT attributable to the property. For example, if the executor of the will
was liable for the tax, he must make a claim. IHT on specific bequests of
land in the UK is usually borne by the executors unless the will provides
otherwise.
For capital gains tax purposes, your wife's base cost will be the agreed
probate value of Pounds 95,000. She will be able to use the capital loss of
Pounds 12,500, together with the indexation allowance thereon, against
capital gains realised on a subsequent disposal of capital assets.

FT  24 APR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Power of attorney can carry risks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM EMIGRATING to the US soon and, subject to negotiation, I intend to let
my house - which I own outright - to my local council for three years under
its private sector leasing (PSL) scheme. The council's guide to PSL includes
the statement: 'If you intend to live outside the United Kingdom, in
consultation with your solicitor, you will need to appoint a power of
attorney to look after your affairs. The power of attorney will assume all
the obligations and responsibilities of the owner while you are away.' This
will include repairs and rent collection - the quarterly cheque will be sent
to the power of attorney to avoid deduction of tax under the Income and
Corporation Tax Act 1988.
Will I be liable for tax on the rent I get? What is entailed by having a
power of attorney (my sister-in-law has agreed to act in this regard)? If I
ask her to pay the rent into an offshore account held jointly by myself and
my husband, is this legal? I don't want her to be charged tax on my behalf.
If the rent will be your only source of income in the UK after the end of
the UK tax year in which you emigrate, then it will be taxed here as though
it were the only source of income of a UK-resident married woman, broadly
speaking.
Ask your tax office for the free booklet IR20(1992): Residents and
Non-residents: Liability to Tax in the United Kingdom. The UK's right to tax
the rent is preserved by article 6 of the US-UK double taxation convention.
If the rent is paid to your sister-in-law, she will indeed be assessed to UK
tax on your behalf (as your agent). She can certainly pay the rent into an
offshore bank account, but she will want to be sure that you will always
provide her with sufficient money to meet the tax demands on time (as well
as money to pay for repairs etc., of course).
Doubtless there is complete mutual trust between your sister-in-law and
yourself, but she would be taking responsibility for your obligations and
liabilities (regardless of her ability to obtain reimbursement from you), so
it is not something which you should ask her to do without cast-iron
guarantees that she will not end up out of pocket or in an embarrassing
situation.
You might like to suggest that she consult a solicitor before deciding
whether to accept the power of attorney which you are offering her (and, no
doubt, you will offer to meet the bill for her solicitor's guidance). As a
first step, you should talk to your own solicitor, who will be able to give
you general guidance on your overall prospective tax position etc, as well
as explaining the risks inherent in both granting and accepting a power of
attorney.

FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Endowments - your inflexible friend -
Insurance companies are slashing payouts to with-profits policyholders.
Philip Coggan examines why
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK market might have had a good year in 1992 but with-profits
policyholders could be forgiven for not noticing. A wave of bonus cuts
across the sector means that most investors will receive less than those who
cashed in policies one year ago.
A survey by Money Marketing, conducted with actuary Clay &amp; Partners, found
that the average payout on a 10-year endowment policy fell 8.3 per cent from
Pounds 8,290 to Pounds 7,603. Payouts on 25-year endowment policies, the
kind often used to repay a mortgage, fell less sharply: 1 per cent, from
Pounds 37,937 to Pounds 37,585. (For the assumptions, see footnotes to the
table). Meanwhile, the FT-A All-Share index rose 15 per cent over the year
to March 1.
What is the reason for this apparent discrepancy? The prime cause is a
malfunction of the 'smoothing' process which is one of the main selling
points of with-profits policies.
Such policies pay two kinds of bonuses - reversionary (or annual) which are
paid every year, and terminal, which are paid at the end of the policy's
lifetime. The reversionary bonuses, once paid, cannot be withdrawn. The idea
is that the steady build-up of bonuses prevents investors from being hurt by
the wild swings of the stock market. Any excess growth can be paid in the
form of the terminal bonus.
The system went wrong in 1990 - a bad year for investment returns
world-wide. Competitive pressures, and an optimistic view of future returns,
caused companies to maintain bonuses at unrealistically high levels. Lower
economic growth and interest rates since then have forced companies to take
a more sober view.
In effect, those whose policies matured in 1990 and 1991 received an
unjustified windfall; present policyholders are paying the price. The
conclusion of the survey is that the trend of falling payouts could continue
for some years.
That said, insurance companies can point out that those who have maintained
their policies until the termination date have received healthy investment
returns. The Money Marketing survey shows an average annual yield of 11.4
per cent on 10-year policies, and 12.6 per cent over 25 years.
The key requirement, of course, is for investors to maintain their policies
until the end of the term. The problem is that many find it difficult to
make this commitment. A Securities and Investments Board survey, published
late in 1991, showed that 23 per cent of with-profits policies were
surrendered in the first two years. Most of those policyholders will have
lost a large part of their premiums. The industry attacked the survey's
methodology but later admitted that early surrenders were too high.
The Money Marketing survey focuses on one aspect of the problem - surrender
values after 24 years of a 25-year policy. You might think there would be
little difference between the payouts one year apart - and, indeed, there
aren't at such companies as Norwich Union and Equitable Life. The table
shows that the proportion of final payouts they deliver after 24 years is 92
and 91 per cent respectively.
But this is not so at Royal Insurance, which pays just 50 per cent of the
final proceeds after 24 years. On the Money Marketing assumptions, this
would cost the policyholder almost Pounds 18,500. There is an argument that
policies should be designed to discourage short-term investors but anyone
who has stuck it out for 24 years is hardly a fly-by-nighter.
The good news, at least, is that the industry seems to be recognising the
injustice of this and improving late surrender values. The average surrender
value after 24 years actually increased 4.5 per cent last year, even though
final payouts were falling.
A related issue is the percentage of final payout which consists of the
terminal bonus. The higher the percentage, the more risky the policy. The
tables thus show payouts with and without this bonus.
Commercial Union comes out ahead, if terminal bonuses are excluded, over
both 10 and 25 years (and, indeed, the 15- and 20-year periods as well). If
the terminal bonuses are included, then General Accident takes over from
Standard Life as the top-paying company over 25 years. Royal London, which
is top over 10 years, had not announced its payout by March 1, the end-date
for the survey. So, the table could change later this year.
At the other end of the scale, the worst performances have been produced by
Guardian Royal Exchange and the Life Association of Scotland. GRE is bottom
of the tables over 10 and 25 years; LAS over 15 and 20. The 25-year return
from GRE was Pounds 29,260 - just two-thirds of the figure achieved by
General Accident.
If you invest in a poorly performing unit trust, you can simply move your
money elsewhere. But if you are, say, seven years into a GRE policy, your
options are much more limited. If you surrender the policy, you will pay
heavy penalties. You can keep making payments in the hope either of selling
the policy in the second-hand market after a few more years or that GRE's
performance improves. Either way, you risk throwing good money after bad.
You could make the policy paid-up (stop paying premiums but leave what you
have already invested alone); but this might be difficult if your policy is
linked to a mortgage. In short, an endowment policy is an inflexible friend
 -which makes their mass marketing all the harder to understand.
Money Marketing also reports a worrying tendency for some companies to
refuse to supply figures. The main reason for this trend - cited by, for
example, Scottish Equitable - is that companies have ceased to market
traditional with-profits policies and are concentrating on the unitised
version (see Barry Riley's article on this page). As Money Marketing
comments, if this trend continues, it will be very difficult for advisers
and policyholders to monitor their investments. And the natural suspicion is
that, away from the glare of publicity, returns will fall rather than rise.
Copies of the survey are available for Pounds 3.75 from Ian Paxton at Money
Marketing on 071-439 4222.

FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Unitised plans, are savers getting a
raw deal? - Millions are buying them but there are growing concerns over
their complexity and how they are being marketed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON MONDAY, a select group of learned actuaries will gather in Staple Inn
Hall to debate the subject of so-called unitised with-profits (UWP)
contracts. These are not just of academic interest - they are being bought
by millions of savers every year.
Some fear that marketing men may have created unrealistic expectations among
policyholders, and many believe UWP products should be designed more
consistently.
Actuaries are concerned because they are the professionals responsible
primarily for the soundness of life assurance companies. Many of these life
offices are now marketing UWP plans to supplement or replace the traditional
with-profits contracts which have been around, in various forms, for over a
century.
Unitised plans have been marketed only since the mid-1980s, but are
mushrooming. If you have bought any kind of with-profits bond - a form of
single-premium life assurance savings contract - it falls into this
category. Most of the personal pension plans taken out recently are also
unitised.
Under a unitised with profits policy, the investor buys units, on which
bonuses are added each year rather than, as with a conventional with profits
policy, to the sum assured. The idea is that the investor finds it easier to
understand the policy and there is less of a strain on the insurance
company's reserves in the early years.
Regular-premium endowment plans continue more often to be traditional than
unitised but Standard Life, the market leader, has switched all its mortgage
endowments to the unitised structure.
Actuaries want to be sure that these contracts are based soundly so that,
where they offer investment guarantees, there is no risk that freak
conditions could involve the company in big losses.
The public probably need not worry about such matters, but there are more
general worries. Chiefly, these concern the sheer complexity and
unpredictability of UWP products. Even the companies which designed and
introduced them may not be sure how all their features will be applied over
the long term. Some time bombs may be ticking.
The ultimate danger is that people will find they have bought a pig in a
poke. A with-profits contract is designed to permit normal investment risks
to be smoothed out, but the risks cannot be eliminated completely  - not
unless they are borne, possibly unfairly, by other types of policyholder.
Actuaries are committed to satisfy the 'reasonable expectations' of
policyholders. But unless these unitised plans are knocked into some sort of
consistent order, and are explained properly to investors, it will be hard -
perhaps impossible - to define what a reasonable expectation might be. If
millions of savers are disappointed because of some future stock market
crash, the reputation of the life industry could be damaged seriously.
Two separate documents will be discussed on Monday. The main attention will
focus on a paper produced by John O'Neill and Howard Froggatt from Bacon &amp;
Woodrow, an independent firm of consulting actuaries. (This is,
incidentally, the same firm which upset the industry recently by saying that
with-profits personal pension plans should not be touched with a bargepole
at present because companies have been paying out too much in bonuses).
Over the next few years, B &amp; W says, companies will have to rebuild their
reserves and returns will be better on the alternative form of contract, the
unit-linked plans which are invested directly in underlying portfolios.
The other document is the report of a working party of the English and
Scottish actuarial institutes. This will comment on the results of a survey
of leading life offices. Unfortunately, it will not be published until
Monday; but the chairman of the working party, David Purchase, said it had
thrown up some interesting material in a largely uncharted field.
Why has the life industry switched away from traditional with-profits
contracts to the unitised form? There are several reasons, according to
O'Neill and Froggatt, who say:
A desire to apply the smoothed with-profits approach to single-premium (or
lump sum) investments led to the introduction of with-profits bonds.
Bonuses on traditional with-profits contracts are having to be cut. Unitised
products have been seen by some offices as a way of starting again, with
bonuses initially at a lower level.
Traditional contracts were fine for constant premiums but were hard to adapt
to personal pensions where premiums often vary substantially with earnings.
Unitised plans were seen as the answer.
Companies wish to offer policyholders the option of switching their
unit-linked contracts into with-profit funds which can make sense, for
instance, when pension plan-holders are approaching retirement age and need
to reduce their investment risks.
Some companies have been running short of capital, and unitised plans tie up
fewer reserves than traditional with-profits contracts, at least in the
early stages.
Ultimately, though, there is no magic in UWP contracts. Volatile investment
returns cannot be smoothed out completely, and there must from time to time
be losers as well as winners among the policyholders (which is why B &amp; W has
told its clients to avoid with-profits pensions).
As for the marketing hype, the life assurance regulator, Lautro, has
reprimanded several life offices selling with-profits bonds for not making
it clear enough that bonuses and capital values can go down.
Thus, controversy surrounds the notorious market value adjusters (sometimes
called market value adjustment factors) which are part of the small print of
UWP plans. Life offices have the right to apply an MVA in difficult
investment conditions - jargon for saying that the cash-in unit value of
with-profit bonds and other UWP products may be cut, so savers could get
back less than they put in.
Exactly when should MVAs be imposed, though? 'An office needs not only to
use its MVA appropriately but also to make sure that its policyholders are
aware of the use,' say O'Neill and Froggatt.
Purchase also is concerned that market practice on MVAs is too vague for
policyholders. 'This is an area where the actuarial profession should be
giving some guidance,' he says.
O'Neill and Froggatt say, somewhat surprisingly, that few offices have
actually applied MVAs so far. Others suggest that write-downs have been
comparatively common, although MVAs may be applied to different types of
policy in different ways.
Despite the doubts, however, O'Neill and Froggatt say that UWP contracts
potentially are more transparent and open than traditional with-profits
plans. Like it or not, UWP is here to stay.

FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Three steps to share 'success'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERYBODY wants to find the magic formula that produces sure-fire share
selections. Given the bewildering gyrations of the market, this is not
surprising.
The latest author to outline his theories is Raymond Caley, a broker who has
been an active investor for more than 25 years. His book* outlines a
step-by-step system under which shares are selected only if they meet three
criteria. These sound relatively simple.
The first is that shares should be bought only if their price has reached a
high for the past 12 months, or longer. It might seem odd to pick a share
when it has reached a high, rather than a low. But Caley is looking for
evidence that other people, and particularly the investment institutions,
have started to see merit in the stock.
The second step is to buy shares where profits are set to break records.
Finally, one should look only for shares where the price-earnings ratio is
at least 25 per cent below the sector average. So, if the sector p/e is 16,
the share's p/e should be no higher than 12. The combined result is to
acquire shares in companies with a sound business position, but to avoid
paying an inflated price.
Caley then adds two safeguards which apply once you have bought the stock.
Investors should sell shares (a) if the price falls back 17.5 per cent or
more from the peak price; or (b) if the p/e ratio rises 25 per cent or more
than the sector average. These criteria give the investor clear signals
which indicate when to take a loss and when to realise a profit.
Although the criteria are fairly straightforward, the difficulty lies in
compiling the information on which to base the investment decisions. The
Financial Times publishes share price highs, for example, but these are
compiled for a calendar year (with the exception of the first three months
of the year), not on a rolling one-year basis. So, investors must keep their
own records to follow Caley's system.
Even more of a problem is that Caley (for quite understandable reasons)
focuses on future earnings. So, investors have to rely on brokers'
forecasts, derived from whatever source is available (the Investors
Chronicle, Earnings Guide, Estimate Directory or newspapers), to assess the
second and third criteria: the prospect of record profits and the relative
level of the p/e ratio.
Brokers' forecasts often can be wrong - as the shareholders of companies
such as Parkfield and Queens Moat Houses can attest. But Caley would argue
that if the analysts were wildly wrong in their forecasts, then this might
well have been picked up by share traders; thus, the stock would not be
trading at a 12-month high.
The third criterion relies on investors choosing shares at a 25 per cent
discount to the sector p/e. To help readers, Caley gives his own list of the
average p/e's of the sectors. These might provoke some debate among the
experts - FT-SE 100 stocks and those with market capitalisations over Pounds
100m are, for instance, assigned a p/e of 15 while conglomerates are allowed
a p/e of 10.
Caley's system has its virtues, though, not the least of which is that it is
fairly demanding. It is quite difficult to find stocks where record profits
are expected, where the share price has risen over the past 12 months - and
where they are still rated on a discount to the sector.
In the book, Caley writes: 'For example, the system did not identify any
suitable shares in 1989. And in many months of 1990 and 1991, and for much
of 1992, there was a dearth of attractive shares suitable for investment.
The explanation lies mainly with the fact that the technique unearths
recovery shares brought about by a sustained decline in interest rates.'
With the UK economy showing signs of recovery, Caley believes 'there will be
more shares to invest in.' He goes on to cite stocks selected by the system
in the past, such as Airtours, the best-performing share of 1991. But it is
not foolproof: Instem was one pick which had to be sold after a 10 per cent
decline.
Keeping the records required to follow the system would be quite
time-consuming, which might deter all but the highly-enthusiastic amateur
investor. Nevertheless, private investors might find the system useful as a
cross-check for their own picks.
If your own selections fail Caley's criteria, you might re-examine your
reasons for buying them.

FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Investing in a 'cocktail' -
International bond funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME INVESTORS who want fixed incomes may well be looking beyond the UK.
They could, for instance, be pessimistic about the outlook for gilt returns,
believing the scope for further British interest rate cuts is limited and
that the market will be flooded with a new supply of gilts.
International bond funds deal in bonds issued by other governments and
foreign corporations. Net sales funds totalled Pounds 191.9m last year,
attesting to their popularity.
The table, produced from Micropal, shows the 10 largest international bond
unit trusts with one year-performance figures. Schroder's Global bond fund
is one of the 10 largest in the sector, but lacks a one-year record and is
not included. The largest is Mercury Asset Management's Global bond fund,
which has grown to more than Pounds 252m since its launch in January 1991.
Richard Royds, managing director of Mercury Fund Managers, says an
international bond fund makes money for its investors in a 'cocktail' of
ways. It should find a market that offers the prospect for capital growth;
it should aim for a reasonable yield to provide income for investors; and it
should make money out of currency trading.
Investing in bonds denominated in a foreign currency does, of course,
involve an extra layer of risk. If sterling rises against other currencies,
the value of overseas bonds will fall in sterling terms. But sterling's
decline late in 1992 means that the one-year performance figures shown in
the table are higher than the investor would normally expect.
The average growth rate for the sector was 21.2 per cent and the top 10
funds, listed by size, all either matched or beat the sector average - with
the exception of Providence Capitol's Worldwide bond trust. It says the
reason was its limited exposure to Japan, which pushed up the yield on the
fund but, given the yen's strength, resulted in lower performance.
At present, Mercury's Global bond fund is split geographically between 28
per cent in gilts, 27 per cent in Japan, 18 per cent in Spain, 12 per cent
in France, 10 per cent in the US and 5 per cent in Australia. Royds says the
Japanese exposure is a currency ploy, and US bonds are in favour because the
company believes the dollar will strengthen against its present sterling
level.
Managers see European bonds as particularly attractive because interest
rates, while higher on the Continent than the UK, are expected to fall. The
slide towards lower rates has begun, with the recent cut in France, but has
yet to extend to high-yielding European government bond markets such as
Italy and Spain.
Funds holding the high-yielding bond markets expect to make substantial
capital gains as interest rates drop. Barclays Unicorn launched a European
bond fund in January to take advantage of high real yields in Europe - with
the hope of capital gain if/when German base rates are cut.
Some funds aim solely to provide capital growth. Beckman International, with
a yield of 3.3 per cent in the year to April 1, is an accumulator fund which
re-invests income automatically to provide capital gains.
Investors should not be seduced by high yields but should look at
performance and charges. The standard fee is 5 per cent initial and 1 per
cent annual. But there is a good deal of variation.
Mercury, for instance, has lowered its initial charge temporarily from 5 per
cent to 4 per cent until July. Its annual charge is 1 per cent. The initial
charge on Barclays Unicorn European fund is 3.5 per cent and 0.75 per cent
annual.

FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Workers with a stake in success -
Employee Share Schemes / How staff can promote their own company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 1m people are taking part in profit-related pay schemes, according
to the government. This week, it launched a booklet* publicising the various
tax-efficient plans which encourage employees to help in promoting the
financial health of their companies.
Profit-related pay, or PRP, is just one of the schemes mentioned in the
booklet. All-told, one fifth of the workforce is now covered by some kind of
financial participation scheme. The main types are:
Profit-related pay
PRP schemes link part of an employee's earnings to the profitability of the
company for which he works.
If it is a registered scheme, PRP is tax-free up to a limit of 20 per cent
of pay or Pounds 4,000, whichever is the lower. The costs incurred by a
company in setting up such a scheme are tax-deductible.
David Cohen, of City lawyer Paisner &amp; Co., says many recent schemes have
asked employees to sacrifice part of their basic pay in order to qualify for
the profit-related element. The government believes PRP will encourage
flexibility in pay levels and improve the labour market in the long run.
Profit-sharing schemes
A trust is set up by a company to which it gives cash (often based on the
group's profits); the money is tax-deductible for the firm.
The trust uses it to buy shares which it allocates free to employees who, so
long as they hold the shares for at least five years, will not have to pay
income tax on the proceeds. But capital gains tax could be payable, based on
the increase over the initial value of the shares.
Discretionary share
option schemes
These tend to be known as executive schemes, since they can be offered to
selected employees. Executives are allocated options at a fixed price and
pay with their own money. If they are held for three years, profits are not
liable to income tax. But CGT is payable, based on the difference between
the option and sale prices.
SAYE share option schemes
Employees can put aside up to Pounds 250 a month for five or seven years.
The sum saved is deposited with a bank, building society or with National
Savings and earns tax-free interest (in the form of a terminal bonus). At
the end of the period chosen, the employee can either take the cash or use
it to buy shares in the company.
The price set for the share purchase will be at a discount (normally 20 per
cent) to the trading price at the start of the saving period. So, provided
the company has not got into difficulty, there is a chance of a substantial
profit on the shares. If not, the savings plan still provides a reasonable
tax-free return, equivalent to 5.53 per cent over five and 5.87 per cent
over seven years. Rates on options granted before April 1 are more
attractive.
Employee share
ownership plans
A company sets up a trust which acquires and distributes shares to existing
employees. Payments by the company to the trust qualify for corporation tax
relief. Cohen says these trusts are designed for longer-term ownership, but
do not have the same tax advantages for employees as a profit-sharing trust
(although the two can be used in tandem).
The idea behind all these schemes is that, if workers have a stake in their
employer, they will be motivated to work harder (and less likely to go on
strike). As far as the employees are concerned, such schemes are normally
paid on top of their basic salary - and any extra money (especially in a
tax-free form) is welcome.
The SAYE scheme, although it involves investing your own money, is regarded
generally as a highly attractive investment provided you can maintain your
holding for the minimum of five years.
After the qualifying period is up, employees must decide whether to hold
their shares or exchange them for cash. The danger is that if the employer
goes bust, they could not only lose their job but the bulk of their savings
as well.
On the other hand, shares tend to outperform the building society in the
long run. If you have savings elsewhere, and you are confident about your
company's financial strength, then a shareholding could be a very profitable
long-term investment.
Shares acquired through an approved option scheme can be transferred
directly into a single company Pep (without the normal bed and breakfasting
costs) if the transfer is made within 90 days of the shares emerging from
the scheme. Individuals can invest Pounds 3,000 in a single company Pep (in
addition to a Pounds 6,000 general Pep holding) in any tax year. Returns
within a Pep are free of income and capital gains tax.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN ROGERS, Directus Ltd
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST OF THE trading activity by directors last week involved sales, and
one-third of such transactions concerned the exercise and sale of options.
Philip Kay, the chief executive of City Centre Restaurants, sold 2m shares
at 82p. He has halved his holding over the past year but retains 4m.
John Asprey, chairman of the goldsmith and jeweller Asprey, and managing
director Naim Attallah sold 135,000 shares from their jointly-held Namara
Retirement Fund at 283p. The shares were bought back in August 1992 for
182p. Asprey still holds 49 per cent of the company and Attallah also
retains a sizeable stake.
Keith Bradshaw, the chairman of Takare, the health care group, and Deverock
Pritchard, the deputy chairman and managing director, sold 200,000 shares
each to pay tax liabilities on sales made in September 1992, and on loans
taken out to buy shares in the rights issue of September 1991. Both
directors retain 11,156,096 each.

FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: CGT allowances for March sales
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TABLE shows capital gains tax (CGT) allowances for assets sold in March.
To use it, multiply the original cost of the asset for the figure shown for
the month in which you bought it.
If you subtract the result from the proceeds of your sale, the balance will
be your taxable gain or loss.
Suppose that you bought some shares for Pounds 5,000 in February 1985 and
sold them in March 1993 for Pounds 12,000. Multiplying the original cost by
the February 1985 figure of 1.501 gives a total of Pounds 7,505.
Subtracting that from the proceeds of Pounds 12,000 gives a capital gain of
Pounds 4,495, which is below the 1992-93 CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800. If
you realised no other gains during the year, the profits should be tax-free.

FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Private investors urged to buy gilts -
Bank of England spreads the message as latest Pounds 3bn auction approaches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England is making special efforts to encourage private investors
to take part in its latest auction of Pounds 3bn worth of gilts. The stock
on offer pays a coupon (interest rate) of 7.25 per cent and will be redeemed
in five years.
The Bank has been encouraged by the response to its recent booklet* on the
gilt market for which it received 60,000 written or telephoned requests.
Private investors are turning to gilts because many issues can offer returns
higher than those available from building societies.
A special shortened prospectus for the issue will appear in national
newspapers, designed for the use of private investors. The auction is
divided into two: competitive bids (for the institutions) and
non-competitive (for private investors). In the first, institutions will bid
for the stock at a price of their choosing. The Bank will then accept the
highest bids and allocate the stock accordingly.
Obviously, it would be difficult for private investors to go through this
process. Instead, they are allocated stock at the weighted average of the
prices achieved in the competitive tender.
Although this saves them from some tricky guesswork, it does mean they have
to apply for stock without knowing the price they will pay. And the process
is all the more complicated because the stock is issued in partly-paid form
 -two chunks worth Pounds 50 apiece.
The minimum non-competitive application allowed is for Pounds 1,000 nominal
of stock (the maximum is Pounds 500,000). But because of the partly-paid
aspect, investors must send a cheque to the value of Pounds 53 for every
Pounds 100 nominal - so the smallest cheque you can send is Pounds 530.
If the price achieved in the auction is Pounds 51 per Pounds 100, investors
will be entitled to a refund. But they will then face a bill for the second
payment - a further Pounds 50 for every Pounds 100 nominal - by May 20.
In other words, you send the Bank some money, it sends you some back - and
then you send it some more. If the government really wants to encourage
private investors to buy gilts, they could tidy up this ridiculously
convoluted process.
Those who want to apply (the easiest way is to use one of the forms in the
newspapers) will need to hurry. Applications must be sent to the Bank of
England, New Issues, PO Box 444, Gloucester GL1 1NP, to arrive no later than
10 am on Wednesday April 28. Cheques must be made out to the Bank of England
and crossed 'New issues.'
The advantage of investing in a new issue is that you avoid paying
commission. You can also buy stock reasonably near to face value (many gilts
are trading well above it) so that, if you hold the stock until maturity,
you will incur only a minimal capital loss. Investors can have the stock
placed on the National Savings register so that income can be paid gross.
A more fundamental question is whether it makes sense to buy the issue.
Although the coupon is 7.25 per cent, the chances are that investors will
have to pay a fraction above face value - bringing the redemption yield down
to 7 per cent. For basic-rate taxpayers, the running yield will be around
5.37 per cent - that compares with the 6.95 per cent net yield on Pounds
50,000 quoted by Moneyfacts for the best guaranteed income bond over the
same period. Obviously, a GIB is higher risk (although the Policyholders
Protection Act safeguards 90 per cent of the investment) and is not a liquid
security.
Much also depends on whether you believe interest rates will remain at low
levels for five years. if they do not, you could be locked into a
low-yielding investment. Even if you sell the gilt in the interim, you might
not get what you paid for it.

FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Abbey closes a missing Link - Clients
face charge for withdrawals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY National is to charge its customers for withdrawals from cash machines
belonging to other members of the Link network. The fee will be 60p a time
but there will be no charge for balance enquiries.
The measure, to take effect from June 7, applies only to those people with
savings accounts and not to Abbey's current account customers. The society
says that less than 4 per cent of its customers will be affected.
John Berry, the marketing director, explained: 'The cost of processing
customer transactions from non-Abbey National cash machines is currently
borne by all of our customers and has risen considerably over the last few
years.
'The new charge is simply a way of ensuring that the majority of customers
are not faced with the prospect of continued cross-subsidisation.'
When a Link cardholder withdraws money from the cash machine of another bank
or building society, the card issuer has to pay 43p to that bank or society
plus another 'few pennies' to Link itself.
Halifax, which joined the Link network in July 1989, has charged its
customers for making withdrawals from non-Halifax machines from the
beginning. The Link withdrawal facility is provided on Halifax's Maxim
current account and its Card cash account. The society says that since it
has 1,600 machines, it decided its own customers would never be far from
one. The cost is 60p per withdrawal.
Nationwide, which this week entered the postal account market dominated by
the banks, has introduced a cash withdrawal facility on the new account.
Customers will be able to use the society's 730 machines to make a maximum
withdrawal of Pounds 250 a day but they will be charged 50p for doing so.
The charge for making withdrawals from other Link member machines will be
Pounds 1.
Nationwide says that although it has highlighted the cash withdrawal
facility on the postal account, it is not designed to be (in the jargon) a
transaction account but a high-interest postal account. 'The charge is
designed to reinforce that distinction. We don't encourage people to use it
on a daily basis. It is there for peace of mind,' adds Nationwide.
The society is considering introducing charges for customers of its other
accounts with a Link card facility who use another society's Link machine.
'The move by Abbey National will colour our thinking,' Nationwide says.

FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: News in Brief
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A SPATE OF new fixed-rate mortgage offers came on the market this week, and
Abbey National is offering two of them.
One is 6.99 per cent (8.2 apr) until October 31 1994; the other is 8.99 per
cent (8.9 apr) until the end of January 2000. Both are offered on all types
of mortgage and are portable.
There is a Pounds 250 non-refundable booking charge. Early redemption
penalties are 60 days' interest for the former and 210 days' interest on the
latter.
Nationwide has extended its two-year, fixed-rate mortgage to apply to all
borrowers instead of only first-time buyers. The rate is fixed at 5.75 per
cent in the first year and 6.75 per cent in the second (8.2 apr).
The maximum advance is 90 per cent of the property's value but borrowers
must take out the society's mortgage payment cover policy.
The rate is available on endowment, pension and repayment loans and the
arrangement fee is Pounds 195, with a a penalty of six months' interest if
the loan is redeemed in the first year and four months' in the second.
A three-year rate of 7.69 per cent (8.3 apr), fixed until June 30 1996, has
been launched by Bradford &amp; Bingley.
It is available on all types of mortgage but customers will have to take out
two insurance-related products from the society. The booking fee on loans up
to Pounds 100,000 is Pounds 295, and 0.3 per cent on higher amounts. The
early redemption penalty is three months.
A survey by the Alliance &amp; Leicester building society shows that nearly 7m
home-owners would like to move house. The results, released this week,
follow research carried out before the Budget.
A quarter of those questioned - or 1.7m - believe they are likely to move
within the next year; this compares with 1.3m who moved in 1992. More than
one-third said they could not afford to move but over half over-estimated
present mortgage rates.
'This is like a dam waiting to burst,' said Peter White, group chief
executive. 'Factors holding people back include the effects of the economy,
lack of job security and, surprisingly, the fact that many don't realise how
cheap mortgages have become.'
A new edition of the Pep Performance Guide has been issued by Chase de Vere.
The charts, which are published quarterly, cover the period to April 1 1993.
Around 600 unit and investment trust Peps are listed, together with those
single company Peps where the underlying share is quoted on the FT-SE 100.
The leading unit trust Pep over three years is the Pep Progressive
Accummulation managed by St James's Place. It is followed by Perpetual's
High Income Pep, Schroder's Enterprise Pep, Newton's General Pep, and
Perpetual's Pep Growth &amp; Income.
In the investment trust sector, the five top performers were Ivory &amp; Sime
with its Personal Assets Pep, followed by River &amp; Mercantile's Stepped
Preference Pep, Moorgate's General Consolidated Stepped Preference Pep, Law
Debenture's Pep and TR City of London Pep.
Chase de Vere singled out Perpetual's performance as standing out for its
consistency throughout the charts.

FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: When even the experts are confused -
Norma Cohen uncovers some nagging worries as Scottish Equitable goes Dutch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Equitable's policyholders can be forgiven for feeling a bit
confused. This week, their company announced that effective control would
pass to Aegon, a Netherlands-based insurance giant. Policyholders must now
vote to approve the switch. But how are they to know if they are getting a
good deal?
It seems to offer a lot for with-profits policyholders: Pounds 200m in
capital will be injected into the with-profits pool with no strings
attached. The structure of the acquisition will leave Scottish Equitable
with many of the characteristics of a mutual life insurance company.
In a mutual, all profits belong to the policyholders and a portion is passed
along as bonus, with the remainder locked away in reserves. SE's deal will
put a 'ring fence' around the with-profits pool, totalling about Pounds 3bn,
and all its profits will be kept for the sole benefit of its policyholders
with none going to the shareholder, Aegon.
In this sense, SE's 'de-mutualisation' is more attractive for its
policyholders than that of some other companies in which the acquiring
company has been entitled to a portion - typically, 10 per cent - of the
with-profits pool's profits or losses. Moreover, the Pounds 200m injection
will ease the strain on SE's solvency ratios, allowing it to restructure its
portfolio and move into higher-yielding assets such as equities.
This, in turn, should lead to higher bonuses, the reason being the way
regulators judge the ability of companies to pay these and otherwise 'meet
the reasonable expectations of policyholders.' Companies must have assets of
at least 4 per cent above liabilities, but those calculations include
assumptions about sharp drops in prices for all classes of assets.
Because equities have to withstand a 25 per cent drop in prices, some
companies with solvency margins of 10 to 15 per cent are having to increase
their holdings of gilts and sell equities. At December 1992, Scottish
Equitable had a solvency margin of 10 per cent and, at last July, was 60 per
cent invested in UK gilts.
Policyholders are giving up the right to 40 per cent of the gains made by
the unit-linked side of SE's operations, which accounted for half of all the
new business written last year. They will retain the right to 60 per cent of
these profits although, as Aegon adds new capital, that share will fall to
50.2 per cent. At present, with-profits policyholders are entitled to 100
per cent.
But Aegon is also injecting Pounds 40m into the unit-linked portion of the
business, which should help it become more profitable overall. Policyholders
may find they have a smaller slice of a much larger pie with no resulting
loss in profit. Also, policyholders effectively will be paid for the share
of the profits they are surrendering through a one-off bonus, likely to be
roughly 40 per cent of one year's bonus payment.
All these are reasons why policyholders can take considerable comfort from
the deal, but there are some nagging concerns.
First, shareholders may well ask if the price is fair - a question that
stumps even the experts. Aegon is paying Pounds 240m, a price equal to the
so-called 'embedded value' of the portion of the business they will control,
plus 10 times one year's earnings.
This embedded value is an estimate of the profit which will be released into
policyholders' funds over the life of each policy. But estimates of any
pool's embedded value will vary greatly depending on actuarial assumptions
about such things as morbidity, investment returns and expenses.
It is not possible to determine if the embedded value is realistic without
reading the full actuarial valuation, and SE is not required to give that to
policyholders - although it might choose to do so.
A voting trust will look after the interests of with-profits policyholders
and will have the right to name directors of the overall organisation. It
will have a 'golden share' in that it can restrict certain kinds of actions
by the main board. But should the with-profits pool fall below 20 per cent
of all business, the golden share will cease, although the trust will
continue to administer the affairs of the pool.
The question is what role Scottish Equitable imagines with-profits business
will play in its future. David Berridge, the group chief executive, says
that half of all business written in 1992 was unit-linked.
The bulk of the rest was unitised with-profits, a product where
policyholders join the with-profits pool. But a marketing shift could reduce
the protection for with-profits policyholders over time, a nagging worry for
some.
What will happen if policyholders do not approve the deal? Berridge has made
clear that the company needs capital if it is to continue to grow. Without
this, it will have to restrict its new business and limit payouts to
policyholders - and that is something no one should want.

FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Making the most of perks - The pros
and cons of holding a gold card
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVING a gold card was a mark of wealth in the yuppie days of the 1980s.
Producing one to pay for goods or services made its owner feel good: it
signified that his income was above average, and offered high spending
limits plus other perks.
But with the recession causing many people to reassess their priorities,
gold cards came under increasing scrutiny. And with the recession still
biting, the question arises: are they now more of a liability than an asset?
To qualify for a gold card, you must have income of at least Pounds 20,000
(although the minimum at Robert Fleming is Pounds 40,000 and usually Pounds
75,000 at Coutts) so that issuers know you have the means to settle any
large bills. But that has not stopped some issuers running into substantial
bad debt problems.
Last December, American Express halved - to Pounds 5,000 - the overdraft
facility for its gold card customers and it has suspended the facility
altogether for new customers, at least for the time being. Unsecured lending
above Pounds 2,500 also has been suspended for its green card customers in
the UK.
Girobank has gone even further and last year withdrew its gold card for new
customers altogether, although it says the reason was low demand.
Robert Fleming ties its gold card to its Premier account. Unusually, it does
not charge an annual fee but there are no perks on the card other than an
overdraft facility at preferential rates. 'Our research showed us that there
is a significant market which does not want all the travel-related
services,' the bank said.
Some banks offer two types of gold card because of an agreement with
American Express. Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland are among those which
offer their own gold Mastercard or a gold American Express card.
Charge cards
Most gold cards are charge cards where the balance has to be paid off in
full within a certain period of receiving the statement. But some -
including those of the Co-Operative bank, Lloyds and National Westminster -
are credit cards.
The advantage of charge cards is that there is no pre-set spending limit;
thus, you do not have to worry about running out of credit on an expensive
holiday. There is also the discipline of knowing you have to settle the
amount in full once the statement has arrived.
Some issuers, such as Bank of Scotland and Royal Bank of Scotland, insist on
direct debits for settlements. Most levy penalties for late payment, but
there is also the risk that the card will be withdrawn if this happens too
often.
The main disadvantage of charge cards is that they have a higher annual fee
than the credit variety, mainly around Pounds 70-Pounds 85; Barclays has
just raised its levy from Pounds 70 to Pounds 80. Coutts charges Pounds 120,
but reduces that to Pounds 90 if it is paid by direct debit.
But the annual fee is meant to be a charge for a whole range of perks. For
many people, the most important of these will be the chance to borrow money
at preferential rates and without the usual arrangement fee and other
charges.
The box shows the rates offered on gold cards compared with standard
authorised rates of interest by the banks concerned. Some are better than
others.
Barclays Premier quotes a preferential rate of 13.6 per cent (equivalent
annual rate) compared with its standard rate of 19.2 EAR, but this is less
favourable than, say, the 2.5 per cent over base rates offered by Bank of
Scotland.
With base rates at 6 per cent, this means paying 8.5 per cent instead of
Bank of Scotland's standard overdraft rate of 18 per cent.
The preferential rates offered directly by Amex are particularly
unappealing, although the company says it will be offering a new tiered
structure by the end of the year to benefit those gold card customers who
have a good credit history. Preferential interest rates on Amex gold cards
issued by other banks are cheaper: the rate on a Royal Bank of Scotland Amex
gold card is 8.7 APR.
While the perks on gold cards are many and varied, issuers have long assumed
that holders - because of their incomes - tend to be frequent air
travellers; thus, many of the perks are travel-related. But some of these
are more useful than others.
The fine print on Amex's travel accident insurance shows that it applies
only to those 'who are involved in an accident while travelling on a public
conveyance.' But compensation for luggage delays or losses, and a refund of
money spent on a holiday when the travel company fails, are attractive
benefits.
Another good perk - which is offered by most gold cards - is purchase
protection for goods bought with the card, usually for 90 days.
There is the convenience, too of being able to make cash withdrawals abroad
and obtaining cash advances from member banks at home, although most banks
charge a 1.5 per cent handling fee on such advances. And gold cards often
act as cheque guarantee cards for amounts (mostly) up to Pounds 250.
Some issuers have an emergency replacement service for lost or stolen cards.
But charge cards are not usually covered by the Consumer Credit Act, which
limits the cardholder's liability to Pounds 50.
Most issuers of charge cards promise their cardholder protection if their
card is lost or stolen but cardholders are not covered by law should they
fall into dispute with the issuer.
Credit cards
These cards have lower annual fees but do not offer the same range of
benefits as charge-card gold cards. The Co-Operative has now issued 175,000
gold credit cards, much of the business stemming from its pledge never to
introduce an annual fee.
Customers at Lloyds and National Westminster banks have the option of a
'gold' bank account service which will offer a full range of perks for a
higher annual fee. This type of account is offered also by the Royal Bank of
Scotland.
Neither NatWest nor Lloyds offers a preferential overdraft rate on the gold
card alone. Lloyds bank withdrew the facility last October; it says it
wanted to avoid duplication with its gold service bank account. The
preferential overdraft rate at the Co-Operative is only just over two
percentage points lower than its standard rate.
The main advantage of these gold cards is that the minimum monthly credit
limit is high even if it is not unlimited, and the cards do carry some
travel-related perks. But if you possess a gold card out of habit, now could

FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: ICI's rollercoaster - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Imperial Chemical Industries, which this week published the pathfinder
prospectus for the proposed demerger of Zeneca, has had a rollercoaster ride
over the last four months. During mid-February, its shares suffered the same
fate as those of the drug groups, as investors registered fears about
healthcare reforms in the US, Germany and Italy.
The turning point was reached when ICI's board announced it was going ahead
with the Zeneca demerger, that it was guaranteeing the 1993 dividend at 55p,
and was cutting 9,000 jobs. The shares rose sharply for most of March, until
they fell back again on worries about effects of the slowdown of the
continental economy on the chemical operations.
From mid-April, ICI's shares recovered again, with strong buying from US
investors convinced the group will benefit from any economic recovery and an
improved performance from the healthcare sector.

FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Jobless total falls for second month
running - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unemployment fell for the second month running in March, raising hopes that
the recession is over. The seasonally adjusted jobless total fell by 26,000
to 2.94m. The Treasury said it was dangerous to read too much into any one
month's figures and said it was still too early to say whether unemployment
had peaked. The March drop in the seasonally adjusted total of people out of
work followed a 25,500 drop in February and compared with City expectations
of a 30,000 increase last month. The unadjusted jobless figure fell by
46,000 to 2.99m in March, below the politically important 3m mark.

FT  24 APR 93 / Markets: Results are in, investors unsure of the score -
Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST quarter reporting season is in full swing, and stock market
investors are not sure what to make of it.
A week ago, the markets looked happy with the early earnings reports. Share
prices were advancing to record levels, and by the start of this week the
Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 3,478.61, an all-time high.
Yet this week, the mood darkened, and shares fell on four consecutive days.
By midday yesterday, the Dow was struggling to keep its head above 3,400.
The Dow's 2.3 per cent decline was mirrored by similar losses in the broader
market. As of midday yesterday, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index was down 2.4
per cent on the week.
Yet, anyone assuming that the markets' poor performance must have mirrored a
poor first quarter performance from Corporate America would be mistaken. If
anything, this week's raft of quarterly earnings were better, on average,
than analysts and investors had been expecting.
Chrysler, for example, posted earnings (excluding an accounting charge) of
Dollars 530m in the first quarter, a substantial turnaround from the Dollars
13m loss the car maker suffered at the same stage of 1992.
Another corporate giant, the retailer Sears Roebuck, also looked good in the
opening quarter, making record profits of Dollars 435m as performance
improved in almost all of its divisions.
Among other large companies to announce improved, or better-than-expected
earnings in the January-March period, were several banks (Citicorp,
Chemical, and Bankers Trust), the heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar,
the telecommunications giant AT &amp; T, and the financial services group
American Express.
Even some companies operating in hostile business environments put on a good
showing - aerospace and defence manufacturers McDonnell Douglas, General
Dynamics and Northrop all did well, while most unlikely of all, airline
group AMR (parent of American Airlines) offered a pleasant surprise in its
first quarter report.
True, there was some bad news. IBM's results were in line with forecasts (a
Dollars 285m loss) and the computer manufacturer warned that the outlook
remained cloudy, while United Technologies, Chemical Waste Management and
Delta Air Lines all disappointed.
Overall, however, the first quarter reports were mostly on the positive
side. So why did share prices fall?
In a word, valuations. The S &amp; P 500 is trading at about 23 times reported
earnings, expensive by any standards. Even when measured by prospective
earnings, shares look overpriced. The prospective price-earnings ratio of
stocks, according to Value Line, the investment analysts, is currently
around 16. As Value Line pointed out in its latest investment survey, the
last time the markets peaked before a big fall, in late August 1987, the
prospective p/e ratio on its stocks was 16.9.
In other words, stocks are coming close to the sorts of valuations that in
the past have warranted correcting, and correcting in a substantial fashion.
Prices have climbed so high partly because of the billions of dollars
flooding into equities from low-yielding short term assets such as money
market funds and bank certificates of deposit.
Yet stocks also look overvalued because in the past year investors built up
their expectations of improved profitability so high, perhaps too high. This
explains why stocks fell this week in spite of news of stronger earnings.
Sure, profits have improved, but not enough to justify prices at these
levels.
Equally important, investors are beginning to get the jitters about what
will happen to earnings over the rest of the year. They worry that, like the
economy, the upturn in corporate profitability over the last two quarters
may prove to be only temporary.
Economic growth hit a peak of 4.7 per cent in the final quarter of 1992. It
will certainly fall when first quarter 1993 growth is reported. Moreover,
growth could slow even more in the second quarter if the pattern of March's
economic numbers (retail sales, employment, industrial production and
durable goods orders were all weak last month) continues.
If the pace of the economic recovery is slowing, then growth in corporate
profits will slow too. That makes stock market valuations even more
difficult to justify at current levels. Which is why a growing number of
investors and analysts are feeling uncomfortable about equities.
As the Astrologers Fund, those analysts who forecast stock prices by the
movements of the moon and the stars, put it at the top of their leaflet this
week: 'The Sky Is Falling'.

FT  24 APR 93 / Markets: Spell out the risks as well as rewards - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RISK IS at the heart of investment, but while many savers know that it
exists, they find it hard to define. While they strive to safeguard their
portfolios against the most obvious types of risk, more subtle dangers are
sneaking in via the backdoor.
The most common mistake is to focus on the threat to nominal capital, while
ignoring the effect of inflation. Accordingly many people leave the bulk of
their capital in the building society, because the alternatives are 'too
risky'.
But even at 4 per cent inflation - the top of the government's target range
 -the value of money halves in 18 years. So someone retiring now at the age
of 60 might see a drop of 70 per cent or so in the value of their savings
over their remaining lifetime. Given that the cost of care for the elderly
will probably increase at a faster rate than prices elsewhere, this could
eventually result in serious financial difficulties.
Income is just as affected by inflation as capital. Interest rates have
fluctuated between 6 per cent and 15 per cent over the past 15 years. Anyone
who has relied on their building society for income will accordingly have
enjoyed a roller-coaster ride. The canny may have saved the excess income in
the high interest years in order to spend it in low interest times like
today; many will not have been so wise.
Of course, interest rates may well rise from their current levels.
Nevertheless, over the long term there is no reason to expect increasing
income from a building society. According to Moneyfacts, someone who
invested Pounds 5,000 with Abbey National would have received a gross income
of 8.33 per cent in 1978, compared with just 5.35 per cent now. Prices have
nearly trebled over the period.
Contrast the position with equities. If you had invested Pounds 10,000 in
shares in 1980, your gross dividend income, initially Pounds 580, would by
now be worth Pounds 2,016 per annum, a return of 20 per cent on your
original investment.
By and large, share prices keep pace with inflation over the long term.
BZW's equity price index, inflation-adjusted, reached a peak of 453.1 in
1936 (1918=100), fell back to 158.6 in 1952, rose again to 476.8 by 1968,
before plunging alarmingly to 106.2 in 1975. At the end of 1992, the index
was at 458.2. So even if you had bought at the market's inflation-adjusted
peak in 1968, your capital has more or less kept pace with prices.
Dividend income, however, follows a much more steady upward path. The peak
year, in real terms, for dividend income was 1991, when the index reached
382 (1919=100).
The long term real return for equities, according to BZW, is 7.3 per cent
per year with income reinvested. So if capital values keep pace with
inflation, the positive real return comes from an average dividend yield of
5 per cent plus 2 per cent of income growth, roughly equal to the long term
economic growth rate.
The above analysis shows that in the long term, the real risks are taken by
those who choose not to be in equities. But it would be wrong to suggest
savers should rush out and invest all their capital in shares tomorrow.
For a start, equities do not look particularly cheap at present. The
dividend yield on the All-Share Index is 3.9 per cent and the price-earnings
ratio is 20.3. Economic recovery may have already arrived but the market has
anticipated much of the benefits. So a phased, or savings scheme, approach
to equity investment is sensible.
A more fundamental problem is choosing which shares to buy. Most investors
will be aware of the 'blue chips', so-called because of their quality and
dependability.
But blue chips can let investors down, as US investors in IBM have found.
Between the 1987 Crash and the end of January 1993, the computer group's
market value fell by an astonishing Dollars 72bn. There is no example in the
UK which is quite on the same scale; nevertheless, stocks such as BP, ICI,
Land Securities, Pearson and P &amp; O are still lower than they were before the
Crash.
Some of today's blue chips will probably underperform on a similar scale;
indeed it may well be that smaller companies are the sector to choose from.
But for the small investor, stock selection is a difficult task which is why
an investment trust, which owns a wide portfolio of shares, may well be the
best bet.
Even in this sector, there is a big difference between the capital shares of
a split trust and an international generalist such as Bankers or Foreign &amp;
Colonial.
Robert Fleming, one of the largest investment trust management groups, took
a step to help private investors make their choice by asking securities
group Smith New Court to give risk ratings to its trusts.
They were ranked in four different categories - slightly below average risk
(Continental European and Mercantile), average risk (Fledgling, High Income
and the units of the Income &amp; Capital trust), slightly above average risk
(Enterprise, European Fledgling and Claverhouse) and above average risk (the
ordinary income shares of the Income &amp; Capital trust). Investors are also
told which trusts offer capital growth, income or a combination of the two.
Other groups have attempted risk ratings like Fleming's and one hopes that
more follow suit. As a wider public is tempted into equities, the risks, as
well as the rewards, need to be spelled out.

FT  24 APR 93 / Markets: The lure of expensive paper - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONESTY is the watch word of Robert Gavron, chairman of St Ives, the UK's
largest independent printer. Told by institutional investors that they were
thinking of buying his shares he was forced to admit his surprise. 'I had to
tell them I was somewhat amazed given how expensive they are' he said.
With forecast full year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 22.2m, St Ives's
shares do look pricy on a prospective multiple of 22 - well above the market
average. But the decision on whether to invest more heavily is a
comparatively easy one for the company's big shareholders.
If they want to top up their holding in a printing company St Ives is one of
the obvious choices. It is offering a quality product with good medium term
growth prospects and a strong balance sheet.
But if its high rating does not put off some of its institutional
shareholders it may deter small investors. Are they right to be put off?
What they will be looking for is a feel of what might be in store for them
over the next few years. One of the best indicators of the future is the
past.
Since the company came to the market in 1985 it has undergone three main
phases.
Phase one was a phenomenal success. In the first three years the share price
more than doubled to around 220p. The company used its highly rated paper
and cash to make a string of acquisitions, including a book printer,
magazine printers and a packaging business.
Gavron stresses that St Ives was never out to emulate the Hansons or BTRs of
the corporate world. 'When we went public, they just came to us and we were
offered some very good opportunities,' he said.
The next phase was disappointing. St Ives made its biggest acquisition, of
Burrups Printing Group, by way of a rights issue, which coincided with the
stock market crash of October 1987. A lot of shareholders held on to their
new shares until the price recovered and then sold, driving the price back
down.
St Ives went on to make some small acquisitions in 1989, the last of which
was a magazine printing company, which made a loss before being turned
around last year. The financial printing market also collapsed and the
company's shares steadily declined and lost their premium rating.
After October 1990 the group regained all of its lost ground. Its market
capitalisation jumped from Pounds 176m to Pounds 245m in 1991 and to Pounds
330m today.
Over the last three years the City decided that the unfortunate timing of
the Burrups acquisition did not matter. In relative terms the group was
doing well.
Further more, its decision to spend Pounds 130m over the past four years on
some of the most advanced printing presses in the world looks to have been a
wise one. Its high operational gearing should allow it to benefit quickly
from the expected upturn. The printing presses are now running at almost 80
per cent of their capacity and should soon run at full speed.
The next phase is likely to see the company return to the acquisition trail.
With a high rating and a war chest of more than Pounds 13m. St Ives is
actively looking for opportunities in the UK and on the Continent.
Its brief history, since it went public, shows that St Ives has never made a
bad acquisition. The timing of Burrups was mainly responsible for the
disappointing second phase but, having been restructured, it proved a good
buy.
Even the US subsidiary reversed a Pounds 278,000 first- half loss to a
Pounds 304,000 profit for the half year to January 29. It should be making
more, and Gavron believes it will.
The last phase of its history also shows that the company is capable of
earnings growth without making acquisitions. It is also well managed as
underlined by its financial position. Even after the adverse effect of
currency movements, primarily on its US debt, of Pounds 6.7m, it still ended
the year with net cash of Pounds 13.6m.
Medium-term growth is likely to continue. The shares looked expensive in
1991 but continued to outperform over the next two years. It would be a
mistake to buy the shares as a short-term gain. But the stock looks very
attractive to anyone thinking of holding them for at least a few years.

FT  24 APR 93 / Markets: Sid continues to do as he was told - The Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HI THERE, Sid. Woken up?
Retail demand for new issues is on the rise again, after last summer's
collapse. This week the public element of bus operator Stagecoach's float
was nearly eight times subscribed, and other recent issues did well.
It has got to the point where one tabloid newspaper this week advised
readers to apply for a particular flotation, saying the shares would rise
sharply after the issue. Not an unreasonable tip - except that the
particular issue has yet to be priced. As the banker involved said, he is
hurt to be accused of mispricing an issue even before he has.
Flotations abound as companies are rushing to market before the Government's
Pounds 5bn sale of its British Telecom stake in the summer, in which Sid
will also be expected to do his stuff. And on Wednesday Imperial Chemical
Industries gave further details of the demerger of Zeneca, its bioscience
business, which involves raising Pounds 1.3bn.
Add those to all the rights issues that have been coming - the total for the
year to date already exceeds that for the whole of 1992 - and what do you
get? An awful lot of equity coming on the market.
And it is widely forecast that the government will want to raise Pounds 50bn
in gilt-edged stock in the current financial year. Last year's public sector
borrowing requirement was revealed on Tuesday to have been a record Pounds
36.5bn.
So what is wanted is some new source of demand. Now, the bulls of the stock
market have been counting on overseas buyers to plug the gap. And there has
certainly been some interest from them.
But I am indebted to the most irrepressibly bullish of them all, Nick
Knight, and his colleague Chris Dillow, at Nomura Research Institute, for
identifying another source of demand. Not Sid so much as his
high-net-worth-individual cousin. Let us call him Gerald.
Between 1963 and the middle of 1991 there were only three quarters when
individuals were net buyers of equities. (Which three? answers at the foot
of this column.) But in the last six recorded quarters, they have been net
buyers for no fewer than five. And in 1992, individuals like Gerald bought
more UK shares than non-bank institutions did - for the first time in more
than 30 years.
Further evidence of Gerald's investment comes from the building societies.
They have been complaining of a shortage of funds - and threatening a rise
in mortgage rates. Their problem is not so much a lack of retail funds, but
more a shortage of wholesale money.
But included in wholesale money is deposits of more than Pounds 50,000 by
individuals. In other words, Gerald as well as Sid has been taking his money
out and putting it into shares.
There is an obvious reason why. The yield he can get from equities, of
around 4 per cent, is not far short of what the building society is paying.
Indeed if he picks his shares he can get a higher income from equities and
hope for a capital gain too.
As the first chart shows, the real gap between the yield on the All-Share
Index and money market interest rates is the lowest (least negative) it has
been for donkey's years. And for good measure, the second chart shows the
yield on the Footsie index falling below 4 per cent this week.
For the first four days of the week the market was rising. A stream of good
news meant that by Friday morning all the headlines were saying that the
recession was over and recovery had started.
The news included a second monthly fall in unemployment - quite a surprise
given that new jobs are supposed to lag recovery.
There are two explanations for this. Either it is a happy freak, and a happy
coincidence for the Conservatives facing the Newbury by-election and the
local government elections. The other - rather off-the-wall but distinctly
cheerful idea - is that it is indeed a lagging indicator and shows that
recovery began sometime last autumn.
At any rate next Monday's output figures should mark the official end of the
recession.
Some of the other good news was: March car production in the UK was the
highest for 19 years; there were cuts in interest rates in Germany and
France; cheery surveys came from the CBI and the British Chambers of
Commerce; chirpy retail sales figures were published on Friday.
But by Friday this was all too much for a market happier to travel hopefully
than arrive. And the week ended with the Footsie at 2843.8, up 19.4 points
over the week but down from Thursday's close of 2881.1.
That leaves the Footsie roughly where it was when the year started, and
since then forecasts of recovery and of interest rate falls are on balance
more optimistic. What has perhaps been lacking this week has been more
optimism from companies.
On the plus side was Abbey National's annual meeting, where the chairman
said mortgage enquiries were up and arrears down, and first quarter results
from SmithKline Beecham, up 12 per cent pre-tax, and Zeneca, profits
'usefully' ahead in the first quarter, whatever that means.
After weeks of underperformance for pharmaceutical stocks, when the ICI
demerger was looking more and more foolish, there was a reversal this week.
Zeneca may, after all, have timed its launch to perfection.
But on the negative tack, dividends are still being cut or paid uncovered;
CE Heath, the insurance broker, discovered a nasty loss in Australia; and
Hammerson, the property company, produced results even worse than the
nothing great that was expected.
It may take more good news from the corporate sector, to add to the better
economic news, to persuade equities to break upwards again.
The three quarters were: the fourth quarter of 1974, the second quarter of
1975 and the third quarter of 1987. Gerald can buy at the bottom as well as
the top.

FT  24 APR 93 / The rebels who were silenced by the syringe: Under Soviet
rule, psychiatry was transformed into an instrument of repression. The rules
are changing, but Lori Cydilo finds that hospitals remain grim, backward and
deeply feared
</HEADLINE>

ARKADY Stepanchuk will never forget the cold November morning in 1961 when
he was arrested by the KGB. He was just 16. His crime? Going to the French
embassy to seek information about relatives who had fled to France during
the second world war.
KGB agents then searched the one-room apartment where he lived with his
parents and discovered a diary in which he had written: 'Why do we need the
cult of Lenin if we have Jesus Christ?' He was charged with 'anti-Soviet
agitation and propaganda' and confined to a ward reserved for dangerous
patients in a Moscow psychiatric hospital.
There, he was diagnosed as schizophrenic and placed on the psychiatric
register. This - one of many methods used by the state to keep track of its
citizens' mental health - recorded all patients who received psychiatric
treatment and often was used to deny people jobs, flats, a university
education and the right to travel. 'It stripped me of practically all my
rights at the age of 16,' Stepanchuk says. 'I became a prisoner of this
diagnosis.'
In 1966, he requested another evaluation, thinking he would be found healthy
and could resume a normal life. Instead - 'just to be on the safe side,' as
Stepanchuk recalls, bitterly - the commission ruled he was psychopathic.
'They said: 'Who can guarantee that you won't go to the embassy again'?'
Frustrated and angry, he had no way of knowing that he would spend the next
27 years in and out of psychiatric hospitals.
Stepanchuk was released for the last time in 1988. A frail, withered man who
looks older than his years, he says no one, including the psychiatrists who
treated him, ever questioned his sanity.
'It was all deliberate,' he says. 'They never believed that I was mentally
ill. They told me that I was being held to keep me from resuming my
activities.'
Under the communists, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of political dissidents
were forced to have 'treatment' in psychiatric hospitals as a way to silence
them. They were not the only ones. Many whose cases were never publicised
suffered the same fate.
Yuri Nuller, a psychiatrist at the Bekhtereva Psychoneurological Institute
in St Petersburg, explains: 'If someone was in someone else's way, if he
argued with his boss, for example, his boss would say, 'Well, he is
obviously schizophrenic' and order him to undergo a psychiatric evaluation.'
This, invariably, proved he was mentally ill and in need of compulsory
treatment.
In spite of such abuses, leading reformers in Russia and Ukraine insist that
the system is to blame, not individual psychiatrists. Under Soviet rule,
psychiatry underwent a Kafka-esque metamorphosis in which it was transformed
from a branch of medicine into a covert method of social control.
'It was a brutal, primitive system,' says Stepanchuk, who was injected
forcibly with various drugs including sulfazine, a powerful agent used
widely on dissidents that causes fever, temporary paralysis and excruciating
pain. 'They didn't beat you. They used syringes instead.'
Semyon Gluzman is an internationally-renowned psychiatrist and dissident who
spent seven years in labour camps and three in exile for protesting at the
misuses of his profession. Now living again in his native Kiev, he says: 'It
is okay to sit here with you now and talk about these things but, back then,
I went to prison and ruined my life. It was a cruel system. A person who
wanted to work honestly had to pay for it by going to prison.'
Reformers say the psychiatrists, seemingly the masters of the game, were all
too aware that the rules could change, and the tables turn, at any moment.
Stepanchuk bears his tormentors no ill-will because, as he puts it: 'If they
hadn't done what they did to me, the same would have been done to them.'
Laws intended to protect patients against these kinds of abuses have been
passed in Russia already and similar legislation is being debated in
Ukraine. The Russian law, based on US statutes, is the first ever to grant
legal rights to the mentally ill and gives them the right to 'due process'
of law before a decision is made on whether they should be sent to a
psychiatric hospital for compulsory treatment.
It also places responsibility for this commitment with the courts, where
reformers say it belongs, rather than leaving the decision solely to
psychiatrists. It limits a patient's hospital stay to eight days while the
case is being decided, and allows him legal recourse if he disagrees with
the court's decision. Previously, it was not possible to appeal against a
psychiatrist's ruling. .
The old system mirrored 19th century America when the criterion there for
involuntary commitment was a vague 'need for treatment' as decided by one or
two doctors, and there was no limit to the time a patient might spend in a
psychiatric hospital. Statistics show that, until recently, patients
committed involuntary to psychiatric hospitals across the former Soviet
Union stayed for long periods. According to Aleksandr Karpov, the former
chief psychiatrist of the Soviet Union, the average stay in 1973 ranged from
56 days in Sverdlosk Oblast to 248 days in the Udmurt Autonomous Republic in
east-central European Russia.
Although the new law is an important step toward broadening the civil rights
of the mentally ill, changing the bleak reality of their daily lives will
require more than just legislation. Many psychiatric hospitals, particularly
those built before the revolution, come straight from the pages of Gothic
novels. Dark and cavernous, with double steel doors and thick iron bars on
the windows, they look like prisons.
In the geriatric ward of Moscow's Psychiatric Hospital No. 14, the stale air
and the smell of urine create a stench that is overpowering. Several of the
patients, mostly men in their 60s, look emaciated and seem to drift in and
out of consciousness.
A number lie amid their own excrement, their eyes vacant. One frail, wasted
man with skin the colour of plaster moans, through hollow cheeks: 'Mama,
mama.'
When asked how long they have been there, many say they do not know; the
days are so similar that they have blurred together. Many have forgotten
what it is like to breathe fresh air, or to take a walk and feel the warmth
of the sun on their skin, for they are not allowed to go outside.
I saw a psychiatrist intercept a patient and his mother about to slip
outside, stopping them just as they were about to open the door. 'Where do
you think you are going?' she bellowed. 'You're not going anywhere. You're
not allowed to take a walk.' The man looked at the floor, removed his jacket
silently and walked slowly back to the room he shares with 16 other men.
Asked why he was not permitted to take a walk, the psychiatrist replied: 'He
might run away.'
In another ward, an orderly told a patient to sit down. When he did not
comply immediately, the orderly - a sturdy, buxom woman - yelled at him and
shoved him into a chair.
In the insulin therapy ward of Moscow's Clinical Psychiatric Hospital No. 4,
which was built in 1905, there are 11 patients, all young men in their early
20s. Their hands and feet are tied to their narrow metal beds with strips of
cloth. Insulin therapy is a brutal, painful treatment method which has gone
the way of the lobotomy in western countries but continues to be seen in
Russia as a miracle cure for schizophrenia.
Some of the men cry out in pain as the insulin enters their systems.
Psychiatrist Nikolai Izyumov explains, matter-of-factly, that since none of
the men is diabetic, the insulin causes them to go into shock before lapsing
into a coma. The men also become hypoglycemic - that is, having an
abnormally low level of glucose in the blood - because of the treatment.
As he is speaking, a stone-faced nurse and orderly come into the room and
untie a patient named Slava. Wordlessly, they lift him up, prop him up
against the headboard and hand him a bowl of gruel and a small slice of
bread. Their movements are automatic; they seem to have lifted hundreds like
this. Task completed, they leave the room as silently as they entered.
Slava dips the bread into the thin, white gruel. Angry, red welts cover his
tremulous wrist. Asked about them, Oleg Papsuyev, the hospital's director,
replies: 'They simply tied him up incorrectly. Unfortunately, we do not have
any other method to prevent the condition of agitation which may occur
during this treatment. The agitation may be so extreme, so violent, that it
would be impossible to hold patients down, simply impossible. They thrash
about and try to run away, but their thinking at this moment isn't
completely clear. They do not know what they are doing. Therefore, we tie
them down.'
Such ignorance of modern techniques for treating mental illness is a
formidable obstacle to change. Gluzman says claims of recovery are a 'fraud'
because mental health care professionals have not been trained properly.
Electro-shock therapy - known as electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) - is
administered without anaesthetic, which is unsafe and inhumane. And while
sulfazine has been banned in Ukraine, it is still legal and used widely in
Russia. A survey of 568 psychiatrists in Ukraine revealed that 90 per cent
believe it possible to treat psychosis with hypnosis, while 16 per cent
think lobotomy is acceptable.
In spite of the efforts of reformers, many of those who run psychiatric
hospitals now were responsible, either directly or indirectly, for abuses
under the communist regime. Few show signs of remorse or a willingness to
adapt to new circumstances. 'They have neither honour nor conscience,' says
Stepanchuk. There is, too, a resistance to changes, particularly those which
threaten to impose limits on their autonomy.
Aleksandr Kucherov, director of Hospital No. 14, says: 'Our psychiatry has
been overly humanised and we are now reaping the fruits of this. There are a
lot people who need treatment, but a psychiatrist is limited now. In the old
days, you could have forced such a person to get treatment and this would
have served the patient, the family and society, but now this has changed.'
Although the new laws protect people from arbitrary incarceration, anyone
still can be subjected to a psychiatric examination. 'Informing still takes
place today,' says Mikhail Raboklyach, vice-president of the Association of
Ukrainian Psychiatrists. 'On certain occasions, one must report that a
person may be mentally ill. If someone at work, let us say, notices some
deviations in your behaviour, he is supposed to report it to his superior,
who is required to inform a psychiatrist, in writing, who is then supposed
to come and examine you.'
On February 7 1992, President Boris Yeltsin declared that Russia had closed
a dark chapter in its history by freeing the 'last political prisoners' from
the notorious Perm-35 camp in the Urals. But no one knows just how many
healthy people, or those committed wrongfully, remain behind the walls of
psychiatric hospitals. Yuri Savenko, president of the Independent Russian
Psychiatric Association, says: 'Only the former KGB knows the exact number.
This is a very serious problem which has not been resolved to this day.'
Unearthing all the abuses of the past, and making reparation, will be an
arduous task. But allaying the fear and mistrust of psychiatric hospitals
which remains rooted deeply in the national psyche could prove to be the
most daunting challenge. Andrei, a fifth-year law student who is a voluntary
patient in a Moscow psychiatric hospital, admitted that going there was a
decision with which he wrestled for more than a year. 'Everyone is afraid of
ending up in a psychiatric hospital,' he said, adding: 'Some people say it
is better to die than to become mentally ill.'

FT  24 APR 93 / The Long View: Gilt buyers beware
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS item one: British government borrowing reached an astonishing record
for a single month of Pounds 9.5bn in March. News item two: the Bank of
England has begun actively promoting government securities to private
investors - for instance, by distributing 360,000 copies of a small
investors' guide to gilts, and by placing special application forms in the
newspapers to encourage private buyers' subscriptions to its monthly
auctions of new gilts. The latest of these comes next Wednesday, a Pounds
3bn offer of five-year bonds.
We are not yet being asked to tell Sid, but it might come to that. Plainly,
the Bank of England has done its sums and decided that it must market
government debt more energetically to the personal sector. It has over
Pounds 40bn of gilts to sell this financial year; and although the life
assurance companies might invest Pounds 15bn, the pension funds, which have
hardly any cash inflows at present, will not be significant buyers.
That leaves foreigners (who are, in most cases, unpredictable speculators),
and the banks, which will not buy on any serious scale until money market
rates are cut to 5 per cent or less - an event which, effectively, depends
on further rate reductions by the Bundesbank. This is because the government
fears that any weakness in sterling will ruin its chances of holding
inflation below its self-imposed 4 per cent ceiling, so it will cut
short-term interest rates decisively only if the continentals have moved
first.
The Bank of England's easy option in the short term is, therefore, to go
after private investors - at least, until the building societies start
kicking up a bigger rumpus over unfair competition. Although, late in the
1980s, the personal sector was unloading gilts at the rate of around Pounds
2bn a year (at a time when the government was buying back its bonds for
cancellation), last year it bought Pounds 3bn worth on top of Pounds 5bn
invested in National Savings.
According to the Bank, as many as 60,000 eager savers have requested the new
gilts booklet personally. 'Gilts,' they will read therein, "is short for
gilt-edged securities. The stock market has given this name to British
Government securities because of their reputation as one of the safest of
investments. The British Government, over hundreds of years, has never
failed to meet the interest and capital payments as they fall due.'
Dodgy grammar apart, smart savers also will be uncomfortably aware that the
Bank is being a little economical with the actualite. None of the following
episodes constituted legal default, but they left investors badly bruised.
In the 1888 conversion of the national debt, for example, holders of 3 per
cent Consols were faced with the choice of a half-point cut in the coupon or
repayment at par, which was a long way below the former market value.
After the second world war, inflation was the hazard, so that an investor
foolish enough to buy the notorious undated Daltons (Hugh Dalton was the
Labour chancellor who forced long-term interest rates down to 2.5 per cent
in 1946) would have lost 96 per cent of his purchasing power over the next
30 years. Finally, high income taxes and investment income surcharges have
been used to penalise investors, climaxing in the 27s 3d in the pound tax
rate on wealthy people's investment incomes imposed by Roy Jenkins in 1968.
But the motto of the successful investment salesman is - sometimes give a
sucker an even break. In 1992, the gross rate of return on long-dated gilts
(adding capital appreciation to income) was 17 per cent, and it had been
very similar in 1991. It certainly beats the Halifax. Moreover, every now
and then, gilts have a truly wonderful year as the market realises that real
interest rates are much too high. The last was in 1982 as yields tumbled
from 15.6 to 10.9 per cent, giving rise to a total return of 54 per cent for
the year. Gilt-edged bulls enthuse now at the prospect of another such
bonanza as long yields collapse from 8.4 to, perhaps, 6 per cent. If that
were to happen quickly, it could generate a one-year return of around 40 per
cent.
Remember, though, that the 1982 gilt-edged miracle followed Sir Geoffrey
Howe's vicious 1981 Budget in which he confronted the borrowing problem
grimly: the PSBR fell from Pounds 12.7bn in 1980-81 to Pounds 8.6bn in
1981-82. Moreover, unemployment was continuing to rise steadily in 1982,
from 2.63m to 2.95m - always a comforting trend for bond holders. In
contrast, we must now contend with the flabby policies of Norman Lamont,
with the PSBR forecast to jump from Pounds 36.5bn to Pounds 50bn.
Unemployment, surprisingly, has begun to fall.
The bygone era of personal investment, in which Consols formed the bedrock
of every middle-class portfolio, will not return quickly. The soundness of
gilts rested fundamentally not so much upon the creditworthiness of the
government as on the underlying link of the currency to gold. After that
safeguard went in the 1930s, and especially since sterling floated freely
from the beginning of the 1970s, gilts became much more risky. The modern
equivalents of Consols are index-linked gilts, which are safe but rather
boring. Fixed interest gilts, on the other hand, have become casino
securities, moving increasingly under the influence of the global bond fund
managers who trade billions in a shadowy and rootless market in which
government securities of different countries are given nicknames like oats,
bunds, and JGBs.
Coupon-clipping British small investors must appear much more attractive to
the Bank of England than the global bond men, who will sell gilts short
without mercy at the least sign of trouble. But when you overspend at the
rate of Pounds 9.5bn a month, the loyal private punters are a side-show. You
must solicit the international moneylenders and await your fate. At least
they will not need a booklet.

FT  24 APR 93 / Britain oversaw EBRD's spending on HQ
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK was the only government represented on the building committee which
oversaw the spending of Pounds 55.5m on fitting the new headquarters of the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
However, Mr Nicholas Bailey, the official at the Overseas Development
Administration on the committee, was powerless to prevent spending on new
marble, wood panelling and other 'luxuries' because the government had
provided a Pounds 40m building grant to the EBRD with no conditions
attached, according to a UK official.
It also emerged yesterday that officials from the EBRD's shareholder
governments, led by the Germans, are exploring the possibility of creating a
new post of chief executive at the bank to back up Mr Jacques Attali, the
bank's president.
The idea of appointing an EBRD chief executive has not yet been put forward
by Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister. The suggestion would be
designed to improve the organisational structure of the bank following
criticisms of insufficient budgetary control.
None of the other countries which own the bank were represented on the
building committee, chaired by the bank's budget director, Mr Pierre
Pissaloux. The UK was on the committee because of the Pounds 40m grant,
which was given to the bank as an incentive to locate in London.
'After the EBRD's director approved the budget (at the end of 1991), there
was nothing we could do (about how the money was spent)', said the official.
'It was a nightmare.' The UK's role in the building project would probably
be examined by the auditor general, Sir John Bourn, an official said.
It also emerged yesterday that the architects working on the project,
Berthet &amp; Pochy of France, were appointed on the insistence of the bank and
without following the public tendering procedures which usually apply to
public sector projects, according to a UK government official.
Mrs Marion Pochy, the wife of one of Berthet &amp; Pochy's founders, painted a
mural at the bank's headquarters in collaboration with two east European
artists. They are understood to have been paid less than Pounds 30,000.
Meanwhile, the bank's directors, which represent the countries which own the
bank, have asked for details of a spacious EBRD office in Paris, which is
used principally by Mr Attali.
Many directors did not know of the existence of the office, which is in a
renovated 19th century palace in the Boulevard Madeleine, until last week.
The EBRD said yesterday that the rent on the Paris office was paid by the
French government and referred calls to Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, the director
of the French Treasury. However, his office said the finance ministry had
paid the rent up to May last year and had no idea who had been paying the
rent since then. Bank sources said late last night that the bill was now
being paid by the French foreign ministry.

FT  24 APR 93 / Yeltsin pledges dominant role for presidency over state
bodies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday promised Russians a constitution in which
presidential power would dominate every other state institution if he won
their support in tomorrow's referendum on the country's future.
Speaking on television in his native Ekaterinburg, Mr Yeltsin claimed the
four-question referendum was a pivotal test for Russia. 'Will reforms in
Russia continue, will we finally achieve results that every family and every
region can feel? Or . . . will Russia turn backwards, without realising that
the turning point was so close at hand?' he asked.
A poll published by Izvestia yesterday showed that Mr Yeltsin enjoys the
support of 57 per cent of those who would vote on the first question - do
you trust the president? However, voters are similarly divided over the
second question, on support for Mr Yeltsin's economic programme.
The other questions ask if voters want early elections for the presidency
and for parliament.
Mr Yeltsin hinted that he would push the new constitution through rapidly
against all opposition. Mr Sergei Filatov, the president's chief of staff,
said last night that if he won the referendum, Mr Yeltsin would 'appeal to
the people . . . to adopt a constitution and hold new elections. These
documents are being prepared'. He gave no details but Mr Sergei Shakhrai,
the president's main legal adviser, said these included a new electoral law.
The proposal, full of guarantees of human rights, would allow people the
right to own and dispose of property. This right was mooted in the days of
former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev. But property ownership remains in
a twilight world between legality and illegality.
The president would have the right to nominate the prime minister, the heads
of the armed forces, the head of the constitutional court and other top
judges, the central bank chairman and anyone else in a position of power in
Russia. Parliament would have the right to approve or veto his choice, but
he could override its objections by dissolving it and calling fresh
elections.
This parliament, a holdover from Soviet days, divided into Supreme Soviet
and Congress of People's Deputies, would be replaced by a bicameral assembly
with rights confined to debating legislation (introduced by the president)
and supervision.
In an introduction to excerpts from the draft constitution printed in
Izvestia, Mr Yeltsin said that 'a vote on confidence in the president is not
about an abstract bright future, but about concrete legal guarantees of
civil rights and human values'.
His initiative came as General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, rejected
the charge of corruption brought against him on Thursday night by the
procurator-general as 'a political act . . . aimed at discrediting
government structures'. Gen Grachev is the most senior of ministers and
presidential aides against whom corruption has been alleged. The allegations
emanate mainly from Gen Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president.

FT  24 APR 93 / Virgin and BA renew efforts to end dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS and Virgin Atlantic Airways have restarted talks aimed at
settling the 'dirty tricks' dispute.
Lawyers from the two companies met last week at BA's instigation, Virgin
said yesterday. They revised the draft agreement over which the two
companies had failed to agree in March.
The amended version of the agreement is understood to have been sent to BA,
which last night would not comment.
Virgin does not plan to postpone the start of court proceedings against BA
over compensation for damage done to its business by the 'dirty tricks'
campaign.
The first of the writs could be issued as soon as the start of May, although
the fresh initiative raises the possibility that the two sides might
conclude their long-running row without the need for further legal action.
The 'dirty tricks' campaign was designed to undermine Virgin's business. It
led to BA apologising in the High Court in January for its behaviour and
paying Pounds 610,000 in libel damages. The two companies then began
discussing compensation for the commercial damage done to Virgin.
The draft agreement would have seen BA pay Pounds 9m compensation to Virgin.
The talks foundered on a clause limiting discussion of the case. BA said it
had asked for events not to be 'raked over' but Virgin said it would have
been 'gagged' by the clause. Virgin abandoned the talks on March 19
threatening to produce new evidence against BA in the courts.

FT  24 APR 93 / Pearson to acquire Thames Television in Pounds 99m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEARSON, the publishing, bank-ing and industrial group, yesterday agreed to
buy Thames Television in a deal worth a total of Pounds 99m.
Pearson's decision to buy the 59 per cent stake owned by Thorn EMI, the
entertainment group, triggers a full bid for Thames, which formerly held the
London weekday ITV franchise and is now the UK's largest independent
producer.
The deal is part of a wide-ranging move into the television market by
Pearson. It already owns stakes in British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite
television venture, and Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, an ITV company. Lord Blakenham,
chairman of Pearson, which also owns the Financial Times, said yesterday:
'Our strategy is to increase our involvement in the visual media.'
The acquisition of Thames will be Pearson's first wholly-owned television
production and distribution enterprise. Pearson clearly intends the deal to
be the first step in the creation of an international television business.
Thames will become the heart of a new division which will also include
Pearson's interests in BSkyB and Yorkshire. Mr Richard Dunn will remain
chief executive.
Thames lost its franchise to Carlton in January, but sales of programmes
such as The Bill, Wish You Were Here and This Is Your Life to ITV will bring
in more than Pounds 40m this year.
Although no contracts have been agreed beyond that, senior Thames executives
believe it is likely that further contracts will be agreed for the
programmes, which are in the ITV Top 20.
Pearson will also be buying an international programme distribution
business, Teddington studios in London, a 9.7 per cent stake in the Astra
satellite system which has recently been revalued to Pounds 20m, a 15 per
cent stake in UK Gold, the satellite channel based on programme libraries,
and a library with more than 10,000 hours of useable programmes.
At the end of 1992, Thames had net assets of Pounds 11.8m and a net cash
balance of Pounds 13.8m after finance leases.
Mr Frank Barlow, Pearson managing director, described the Thames deal as
'just an extension of our existing business', which was heavily based on
intellectual property rights.
Mr Barlow said he saw Thames as a base from which to expand into
international broadcasting - including the possibility of taking stakes in
broadcasters in other countries.
As the owner of a UK national newspaper, Pearson is limited to a single 20
per cent stake in an ITV company. But it will keep its stake in
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees below 15 per cent to continue to qualify as an
independent producer under UK rules.
There is likely to be an expansion in business, educational and childrens'
programmes drawing on the strengths of the FT, and Pearson publishing
interests, which include Longman and Penguin.
Pearson's cash offer of 200p a share represents a premium of about 14 per
cent on Thames' closing price on Thursday. They added 20p yesterday to close
at 195p. Pearson shares rose by 10p to 429p.

FT  24 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Asda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Asda's closure of Lofthouse Foods will come as a devastating blow to its
employees but will only confirm the management's reputation for hard-headed
pragmatism. The bacon and sausage meat company lost Pounds 2.5m in the first
half of the year. Conditions have not improved since. Lofthouse's markets
are in long term decline because of consumers' diminishing appetite for red
meat. There is significant overcapacity and Lofthouse could never hope to be
as efficient manufacturers as Hillsdown Holdings.
Since Asda will not adopt the FRS3 accounting standard for this year's
results, the closure costs will be taken below the line. They will be more
than offset by the gains from the disposal of Asda's MFI stake. The bigger
strategic question, though, concerns the future of the company's loss-making
Allied Maples carpet subsidiary. Allied Maples has been heavily rationalised
but is still struggling against fierce competition. Asda must hope that a
pick-up in market demand will permit a recovery and subsequent sale.
This would leave Asda free to concentrate on maintaining the momentum of its
core food operations. Despite recent progress, it still has a huge amount to
do to ensure its long term viability. Budgens' link-up with the giant German
Rewe group suggests that even the industry's smaller fry are shaping up for
the fight.

FT  24 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Bowater
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's US acquisition by Bowater was enough to maintain its forward
momentum. The 2 per cent rise in the shares against a falling market is
another footnote in a four-year record of outperformance. But Bowater's
balance sheet is showing the strain. Yesterday's deal adds 6 percentage
points to gearing, due in part to the write-off of Dollars 78m goodwill.
Interest cover is strong, but Bowater's self-imposed gearing limit of 75 per
cent leaves it room for perhaps one more big deal before shareholders are
again asked to chip in.
If earnings per share growth can be maintained, another rights issue next
year might not interrupt the upward march of the shares. But the new UK
accounting regime will not help the earnings record. If the Accounting
Standards Board gets its way, the cost of rationalising acquired companies
will be charged against profits rather than buried in the balance sheet.
Bowater has not been aggressive in this respect, but rationalisation
provisions for last year's Pounds 450m purchase of DRG and Cope Allman still
amounted to Pounds 42m.
Tougher conditions in US healthcare may also be a worry. If buyers are
serious about cost containment, hospital suppliers of the kind acquired will
suffer. Bowater's pharmaceutical packaging plant in Puerto Rico might also
face disruption if President Clinton revokes tax breaks for drugs companies
manufacturing there. With the business growing strongly, such pressures
would not send Bowater into reverse. But a price/earnings multiple well
above the market average leaves it exposed to any mishaps.

FT  24 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow pressured by poor
economic data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK markets ended one of their worst weeks of the year with further
losses as news of a big fall in durable goods orders and rising bond yields
undermined sentiment, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 15.40 at 3,413.77.
The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 finished fell 2.39 to 437.03,
while the Amex composite ended 0.60 lower at 418.73, and the Nasdaq
composite dropped 5.10 to 658.41. Trading volume on the NYSE was 257m
shares.
Prices opened lower, dropping more than 20 points in the first 90 minutes as
sentiment was pressured by selling in the futures market and by bad economic
news. The commerce department reported that durable goods orders fell 3.7
per cent in March. Even accounting for the impact on orders of the severe
March winter storms, the decline, the biggest in 15 months, was much bigger
than expected. Analysts had forecast a decline of about 0.5 per cent. The
disappointing durable goods figures followed a string of weak data
(including retail sales, industrial production and employment numbers) which
suggest that the economy has been cooling off lately.
The markets were also undermined by two other factors: trading activity in
the stock index futures market, where S&amp;P 500 futures were at a discount to
the price of the stocks underlying the index (a bad omen for the cash
markets); and bond yields, which rose yesterday despite the durable goods
news.
The losses meant that share prices fell on every day of the week - the first
time that has happened this year. American Express rose Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 29 1/4 in volume of 2.2m shares after the troubled financial
services and travel group announced stronger than expected first quarter
operating earnings of 75 cents a share. Investors were pleased by the
improved performance of its credit card and investment banking operations.
Bank stocks, which have been riding high all year in anticipation of
improved profitability, continue to suffer as investors took profits and
expressed concern about the earnings outlook. Chemical fell Dollars 1 1/4 to
Dollars 37 7/8 , Chase Manhattan eased Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 31 7/8 ,
Citicorp dropped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 27 3/4 , Banc One gave up Dollars
7/8 at Dollars 54 3/4 and Bank America fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 47 1/8
.
Canada
TORONTO STOCKS ended the week on a winning note, boosted by a surge in gold
stocks. Based to preliminary data, the 300 composite index was up 19.71
points, or 0.54 per cent, to 3,685.42, for a gain on the week of about 33
points.
Gold Mines gained 1/2 to 9 1/2 after reporting higher first-quarter
earnings. Lac Minerals and Teck Corp., which each reported lower
first-quarter earnings, rose 5/8 to 10 and 1/4 to 17 7/8, respectively.

FT  24 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Bulls manage to jump hurdle at third
attempt - The Australian market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was no cheering, but there were plenty of sighs of relief among
brokers on Friday night after the Australian All Ordinaries index found
sufficient strength to end the week above 1,700.
It was a close run thing. In the end, the index closed 2.8 points down on
the day, at 1702.6. But it could have been worse: no less than three bull
runs in the last 18 months have failed at the 1,700 hurdle.
It is unclear whether the breaching of the barrier presages a sufficiently
strong rally to take the index back to its peak of 2,300 achieved on the eve
of the 1987 global stock markets crash.
Most observers think not; at least not yet. Nevertheless, the All Ordinaries
is now 29 per cent above its end-1987 level, and 9.8 per cent above its
close at the end of last year.
The improvement has been across the board. Eighteen of the 23 sectoral
indices showed an improvement over the 12 months to the end of March,
compared with just three in the year to December, and 10 in the end-February
year.
Clearly, the recovery is broadening as it gathers pace. And there are plenty
of other reasons to be cheerful about the future.
The market did not like the surprise re-election of Mr Paul Keating's Labor
government on March 13 - the All Ordinaries dropped 35 to 1,626.4 on the
first trading day after the poll. But the retreat was temporary, and there
is little doubt that the election has eased the political uncertainty which
was holding the market back.
Recovery from the 18 month recession in 1990/91 has been painfully slow, but
the economy grew by 0.7 per cent in the December quarter, and by 2.5 per
cent over the year. This is not fast enough to bring unemployment down much
from the present 10.9 per cent, but it is faster than in than most other
OECD countries.
The government has made clear that growth is its top priority over the next
three years, and a further fiscal stimulus is possible in an attempt to
reinforce the effects of earlier increases in public spending.
The scope for manoeuvre is limited by the government's need to rein in the
budget deficit, but the target of 1 per cent of GDP by 1997/97 is
sufficiently far away to allow a further stimulus in the August budget,
provided a credible plan for future deficit reduction is announced.
The overall macro-economic background is generally favourable. The
Australian currency has also staged a recovery in recent weeks after
weakening significantly last year. A further cut in official interest rates
will depend on the outlook for inflation remaining favourable, but the
Reserve Bank is unlikely to regard the currency as a constraint if it
decides to move.
Significantly, four of the five sectoral indices which have fallen over the
least 12 months are directly recession related - building materials, alcohol
and tobacco, retail and transport. All could be expected to show solid gains
if the pace of recovery increases. (The fifth sector, metals excluding gold,
is unlikely to show much improvement until the leading economies show signs
of stronger growth.)
Confidence is recovering rapidly. The latest survey of Australian industry
by Dun &amp; Bradstreet showed that business confidence leapt to a four year
high in March, and a report by the Australian Chamber of Manufactures
indicated that more than 40 per cent of manufacturing companies expected to
increase production in the June quarter.
It is also clear that the flood of poor results from leading Australian
companies is ebbing, after two years in which black ink has sometimes seemed
a rarity. Potter Warburg, the Melbourne stockbrokers, says that net
corporate profits, excluding the resources sector, are likely to increase by
15 to 20 per cent this year, compared with a decline in 1992.
On the downside, brokers say that concern about the balance of payments and
the budget deficit may re-emerge, and demand may be dampened by a slug of
flotations and rights issues due over the next 12 months. These will include
75 per cent of Qantas, a further tranche of the Commonwealth Bank, the
failed Adsteam group's Woolworths retailing chain, and at least one
commercial television network.
Perhaps because of these concerns, institutional buyers remain cautious, and
many analysts say there is insufficient steam in the present rally to take
it much further. 'Our view is that the market will consolidate for a couple
of months and then soar to 1,750-1,800 before drifting lower over the course
of the year,' says Mr Nigel Purchase, market strategist at Potter Warburg.
Mr Josef Rudzyn, technical analyst at JB Were, takes the slightly more
bullish view that the All Ordinaries index is heading for the next important
test at 1,786, although he expects the market to take 3-5 quarters to get
there.
Technical and fundamental analysts agree, however, that the market is likely
to take some time to move within range of the elusive 1987 all time high.
'The potential is there, but it will take at least three years,' says Mr
Rudzyn. 'At this stage, even a bull would not put it much closer than that.'

FT  24 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei recovers as yen
stabilises against dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WAYNE APONTE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RENEWED buying by arbitrageurs and pension fund managers lifted equity
prices in light volume, as the yen's rate against the dollar stabilised,
writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average ended 112.84 higher at 19,704.15 - for a 2.9 per cent
decline on the week - after trading between an intraday low of 19,554.86 and
a high of 19,785.06. The Topix Index of all first section issues closed 9.66
higher at 1,532,69, while in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.21 to
1,209.77.
Volume was estimated at 320m shares, compared with Thursday's final 382m.
Declines led advances by 526 to 495, with 157 issues unchanged.
Foreign exchange considerations eased after comments by Mr Ron Brown, the US
commerce secretary, that the yen's advance against the dollar this week was
an exaggerated response to recent remarks made by Mr Bill Clinton, the US
president, that a rising yen was one way to reduce Japan's trade imbalance.
Investors bought futures contracts as the yen's climb against the dollar
slowed, triggering arbitrage-related buying, which carried over into the
cash market.
Equity prices are now expected to trade within a tight range, while turnover
on the first section of the Tokyo stock exchange is likely to remain light
ahead of the Golden Week holiday at the end of next week. One analyst pegged
the upside of the stock market at the 20,000 level, with support around
19,500.
Investors bought Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which ended Y19,000 higher
at Y912,000.
Elsewhere, the stability of the yen boosted the consumer electronic sector.
TDK gained Y70 to Y3,830, Matsushita Electric Y20 to Y1,330 and Sony Y10 to
Y4,700.
The financial sector also rose: Fuji Bank Y50 at 2,040, Mitsubishi Bank Y40
at 2,480 and the Bank of Tokyo Y30 at 1,290.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 42.19 to end at 21,408.03 in volume of
18.4m shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets were mixed yesterday with profit-taking much in
evidence.
HONG KONG closed a volatile week marginally lower on profit-taking amid the
Sino-British talks, due to end Son unday. The Hang Seng index fell 8.30 to
6,750.94, up a marginal 0.2 per cent on the week. Turnover fell to HKDollars
4.1bn from HKDollars 6.1bn.
China Gas lost 30 cents to HKDollars 14.50 and HK Telecom shed 25 cents to
HKDollars 9.95. China Light was unchanged at HKDollars 36.75 after reporting
a rise in half-year net profit much in line with expectations.
BANGKOK rose on heavy trading as investors regained confidence after the
Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges for alleged share price
manipulation. The SET index closed up 2.25 at 901.26, rising 1.3 per cent on
the week. Turnover was Bt7.2bn, the highest in two months.
KUALA LUMPUR gained ground on renewed interest in speculative stocks after a
strong week. The composite index, which hit an all-time high of 701.32
during intra-day trading on Thursday, closed up 0.2 to 691.65, or 4.4 per
cent on the week. Volume rose to 345.7m shares from 337.9m.
SEOUL lost ground as profit-taking emerged following the week's rally. The
composite index eased 1.89 to 735.70, but posted a 4 per cent advance from
the previous week.
TAIWAN was also easier as investors took profits on Thursday's gains,
prompted by the passage of the copyright laws in parliament. The weighted
index closed 62.44 lower at 4,569.25, rising 0.7 per cent on the week.
Turnover was TDollars 42.3bn.
NEW ZEALAND weakened on profit-taking after five successive rises with the
NZSE-40 index falling 13.59 to 1,613.53.
BOMBAY's fall gathered pace with the BSE index 58.29 lower at 2,100.67.

FT  24 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Spain rises on prospects for
devaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CENTRAL banks acted in concert to support the peseta, there were further
interest rate cuts, particularly from France, and some investors began to
worry about the outcome of Sunday's Russian referendum, writes Our Markets
Staff.
MADRID was volatile in early trading but regained positive territory later
in the session. The general index ended 1.33 higher at 247.03, a 3 per cent
gain on the week and a year's high, as turnover soared to nearly Pta30bn.
Mr Chris Cooper of James Capel observed that it was rather a question of
when, rather than if, the peseta was devalued, although the Socialist
government had been clinging to a desire to hold off until after the June 6
elections.
Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities expects interest rates to come down
swiftly after devaluation and has overweighted the market accordingly.
In the market there was considerable activity in exporters with Acerinox,
the stainless steel producer, a significant gainer, closing up Pta500 at
Pta7,900.
Among the banks, Popular and Santander both showed strongly with respective
gains of Pta520 and Pta70 to Pta14,600 and Pta5,100. Utilities were sold
with Iberdrola slipping Pta25 to Pta708.
PARIS was active on the last day of the account with considerable US selling
noted. The CAC-40 index, driven by futures, lost 27.8 to 1,916.58 after a
high of 1,946 and a low of 1,900. The index has shed 3.5 per cent on the
week. Turnover was FFr3.4bn.
Mr Michael Woodcock of Nikko Europe commented that the repo rate cut by the
Bank of France had been expected and lent little support. In spite of the
day's declines he believes that the market will rise again next week to test
the 2,000 level.
Peugeot went against the trend with a rise of FFr22 to FFr564 as buyers came
in after positive comments from Mr Jacques Calvet. However, some analysts
feel that Mr Calvet's hopes of a slowdown in the fall in European car sales
are too optimistic, since there would have to be a phenomenal recovery in
the second half.
Elf lost FFr13 to FFr357 on indirect confirmation that it would be
interested in increasing its stake in Petrofina while among the financials
Paribas outperformed with a rise of FFr3.80 to FFr425.
BRUSSELS met profit-taking amid uncertainty over the Russian referendum and
the Bel-20 index dipped 17.92 to 1,223.94, for a weekly fall of 2.4 per
cent. Petrofina dipped 6 per cent at one stage before closing BFr320 or 3.5
per cent lower at BFr8,770. But the share subsequently picked up to BFr9,050
in the London after-market after suggestions that Elf was interested in
increasing its stake.
FRANKFURT lost ground in thin volume as investors remained on the sidelines.
Traders, who had rushed to buy after the Bundesbank's cut in the discount
rate, took profits to adjust their positions. The DAX index fell 9.64 to
1,657.10, falling 1.3 per cent on the week. Turnover was DM6.2bn.
Gains made in Thursday's post-bourse trading on the interest rate cuts were
eroded across the board. Siemens fell DM7.1 to DM628.4 on speculation of
lower than expected earnings figures to be announced next week. Linde was
dragged down DM10 to DM751 in spite of higher than expected earnings
forecasts announced on Thursday.
MILAN rallied as speculators bought blue chip issues, encouraged by the Bank
of Italy's move late on Thursday to cut the discount rate, and on hopes that
the political outlook will become clearer over the weekend.
The Comit index rose 3.43 to 531.63, for a weekly rise of 3.5 per cent, as
the market waited to learn who President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro would appoint
as a new prime minister following Mr Guiliano Amato's resignation.
Fiat again led the advance, rising L100 to fix at a two year high of L6,860,
before continuing up to L6,920 after hours.
ZURICH ended easier but above the day's lows as uncertainty about the the
outcome of Sunday's Russian referendum weighed on the market. The SMI index
shed 14.6 to 2,162.7, little changed on the week. Exporters were easier in
response to the lower dollar and US economic data. Nestle registered shares
dipped SFr10 to SFr1,115 while Roche certificates shed SFr20 to SFr4,280.
AMSTERDAM fell back in tandem with the weaker dollar and the CBS Tendency
index dipped 1.0 to 110.3, a fall of 0.5 per cent on the week.
STOCKHOLM eased as the central bank failed to cut its marginal lending rate
during the trading session. The Affarsvarlden index fell 7.14 to 1,020.42,
or 2 per cent on the week. After the close, the central bank eased its key
lending rate by 25 basis points to 9.5 per cent. OSLO, however, ended higher
as overnight lending rates were cut to 8 per cent from 8.25 per cent. The
all-share index rose 2.16 to 398.53, up 1.2 per cent from the previous week.
HELSINKI finished the week on a firm tone on hopes of lower interest rates.
The HEX index rose 17.7 to 1,118.6, advancing 5.4 per cent on the week.

FT  24 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY selling of the June Footsie futures contract not only boosted turnover
but led to the day's big fall in the underlying equities market, writes Joel
Kibazo.
Having opened at 2,884, June went into retreat with a leading US house said
to have led the way with a big selling order. Further selling was seen by UK
holders convinced there was unlikely to be a cut in UK base rates.
Attempts at a rally were seen following the 11.30am release of favourable UK
economic data, but this soon petered out leaving June to continue to slide.
The poor opening on Wall Street was seen as a cue for further selling and
the contract fell to the day's low of 2,845 in the last hour of trading. It
finished at 2,850, down 43 and at a slight discount to the underlying cash
market. Turnover at 14,984 was heavy.
Trading in British Steel mainly by Kleinwort Benson was the main feature in
the traded options. By the close volume in the stock was 19,115. Total
turnover was a hefty 52,354 lots.

FT  24 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie mauled in global market slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONCERTED attack on European bond and equity markets, following hard on
the heels of the late slide on Wall Street on Thursday, triggered a sharp
sell off in leading UK shares and led to a turbulent session in gilts.
The sustained weakness in the FT-SE 100 Index, plus the pressure on gilts,
was all the more surprising following additional evidence that the UK's
economic recovery is gathering speed.
But the day's heaviest losses in London equities were concentrated in the
top 100 shares following substantial pressure from activity in the Footsie
future. The Footsie 100 ended a hectic session 37.3 down at 2,843.8, wiping
out most of the strong gains recorded earlier in the week.
London's second-line stocks, on the other hand, encountered very little
selling and the FT-SE Mid 250 index, which outperformed the 100 index for
much of the week, settled a net 0.5 higher at 3,136.2.
Strong rumours circulating in London shortly before the close that a bid for
United Biscuits will be revealed on Monday failed to produce much of a rally
in leading stocks. However Biscuits shares surged in the final half-hour's
trading.
Wall Street's weakness late on Thursday was said to have been caused by a
flurry of selling in US futures. London's 100 index opened almost 10 points
off, as the future quickly retreated to a discount to fair value and
remained under pressure all day, in company with other European markets.
Dealers said the London market absorbed much of the selling in the future
and the cash market but backed off when Wall Street opened yesterday under
renewed pressure following disappointing durable goods figures for March.
The general pressure was said to have been applied by one of the top US
broking houses. There were also worries in the US and Europe about the
possibility of Russia's President Yeltsin being defeated in the Russian
referendum on Sunday; 'If Yeltsin loses, the feeling is that there will be a
lot more downside than upside in European markets,' said a leading trader at
one of the UK integrated securities houses.
Gilts traded erratically, and generally closed around the day's lowest
levels, despite renewed strength in sterling.
The latter gained ground after the latest encouraging economic news, which
included the well-received sales figures for March.
Over the week, the Footsie 100 rose 29.4, or 0.7 per cent, while the FT-SE
Mid 250 was up 53.4, or 1.7 per cent.
Equity turnover was 701.2m shares, although this was boosted by some 88m
Millwall 'new' shares.

FT  24 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Thames sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bid by Pearson for Thames Television had been widely signalled but the
terms were generally appreciated and both stocks held out against the
overall weak market.
Most analysts argued that the 200p-a-share agreed bid, valuing Thames at
Pounds 99m, would boost Pearson's earnings and be a good fit for its
increasing exposure to media and leisure. The Pounds 25m cash which makes up
part of the assets, and to which most analysts were unaware of until Thames
results were published earlier this week, pleased media observers.
Nevertheless there was some caution over the synergy. Ms Louise Barton of
Henderson Crosthwaite said: 'The quality of earnings from production
companies is pretty low.' Pearson shares closed a net 10 higher at 429p
while Thames jumped 20 to 195p.
A large programme trade was said to have left marketmakers scrambling for
stock in Allied Lyons and Whitbread. The shares were squeezed up 5 to 580p
and 11 to 471p respectively. Whitbread also benefited from domestic recovery
talk.
However, Bass, off 6 to 548p, was hurt by presentations held by Courage. The
Australian-owned brewer has been reiterating its threat to defend market
share in the UK.
BZW was recommending Shoprite after a recent visit. The shares gained 26 to
683p.
Budgens spurted forward as the company announced that the German REWE Group
was buying a 26.3 per cent stake from BIL Securities. A price of 55p a share
has been agreed. Budgens shares added 3 to 49p.
Broker recommendations published earlier in the week continued to power
British Aerospace and the shares gained 9 1/2 to 318 1/2 p, closing at their
highest level this year. Kleinwort Benson was said to be the latest house to
point out the virtues of the stock.
British Steel saw big two-way business and ended the day  3/4 lighter at
93p. It traded 6.5m, but there was also one very large order, equivalent to
more than 19m underlying shares carried out in traded options. and said to
have been executed by Kleinwort Benson.
Analysts remained positive about Smiths Industries following results on
Wednesday and the shares firmed 4 to 357p.

FT  24 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Barclays sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An argument that the bank most badly hit by the recession should be the one
to gain most effectively from economic recovery prompted one securities
house to repeat its enthusiasm on Barclays in spite of a recent strong run.
Kleinwort Benson reiterated its buy stance on the stock and added a 1995
profit forecast of Pounds 1.8bn to its existing 1993 estimate of Pounds 600m
and its 1994 figure of Pounds 1.1bn. There was also some catching up with
stablemate NatWest, which outperformed Barclays earlier in the week
following a recommendation from Morgan Stanley.
Barclays shares rose 7 to 440p on turnover of 7.8m while profit-takers took
NatWest down 4 1/2 to 468p.

FT  24 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dollar stocks down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A stronger pound hit big dollar-earning stocks. Having failed to benefit
from Thursday's cut in the German discount rate, the dollar was weakened by
a 3.7 per cent fall in US durable goods orders. The pound was stronger in
its own right and closed in London almost three cents higher against the US
currency.
The currency shift prompted a sharp reversal in the recent strong
performance by the oil majors. Shell Transport fell 14 to 566p and BP
dropped 10 1/2 to 289 1/2 p. However, the pharmaceuticals sector, which had
seen the timid return of some US buyers, suffered most heavily. Glaxo was
the hardest hit stock in the FT-SE 100 index of leading companies with the
shares falling 27 to 575p, Wellcome shed 24 to 736p and SmithKline Beecham
crumbled 15 to 449p in the 'A's. With one foot in the drugs sector ahead of
the impending demerger of its bioscience arm, ICI lost 31 1257p but still
closed comfortably up on the week. Next Thursday the group will announce
first quarter results that are expected to come in around Pounds 180m, down
from the same period last year but better than earlier forecasts.

FT  24 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hanson bid talk lifts UB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RAPID 25-point turnaround in the share price of United Biscuits ignited
renewed takeover speculation, with conglomerate Hanson emerging as the
favourite potential predator. Others mentioned included Cadbury-Schweppes
and US outfits Philip Morris and Campbell Soups. But it was the acquisitive
Hanson that sparked most dealers' interests, although food manufacturing
specialists remained sceptical.
Before the rumours, UB shares had spent most of the session drifting back
with the market, the shares settling 9 off around 3pm. However, as the
takeover talk gained currency the shares spurted forward, putting on 25
points in just half an hour. Marketmakers said excitement was further
generated by much of the business being transacted through the IDB network,
the inter-dealer broker system which guarantees anonymity for both buyers
and sellers and excludes brokers. Options activity was also reported. The
shares closed 14 ahead at 399p in turnover of 2.4m.
Such was the strength of the rumour that some dealers were confidentially
predicting a Monday morning bid of 650p a share, valuing UB at over Pounds
3bn. The accompanying rights issue such a huge takeover would require
satisfied the equation for the market that a major bid has been in the
offing in recent weeks.
Earlier this week, Cadbury shares were hit on rights issue fears as it
talked to analysts about making acquisitions. However, food analysts derided
a Cadbury bid, arguing that the confectionery group already had a firm
strategy away from the snack food business.
Hanson's name also brought scepticism, with specialists suggesting UB's
asset value - which some put at under 200p - would mean a large premium for
goodwill, not a noted Hanson speciality. The potential US bidders were
largely discounted on finance raising grounds. Hanson shares declined 3 1/2
to 238p. Cadbury-Schweppes lost 3 to 479p.

FT  24 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Peseta plunges inside ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX EUROPEAN central banks intervened on the foreign exchange markets
yesterday, buying the Spanish peseta, after the currency plunged against the
D-Mark in the exchange rate mechanism, writes James Blitz.
The peseta finished a disastrous week by falling through its central parity
against the D-Mark of Pta72.78 for the first time since its devaluation in
November of last year.
The currency bottomed out at at Pta74.05 against the D-Mark, still some way
above its lower ERM limit of Pta77.28, and closed in London at Pta73.67.
However, the fall came despite a second rise in two days in the Bank of
Spain's intervention rate, this time to 15 per cent, and a level
intervention that was deemed considerable for the illiquid peseta market. By
the close of European trading, it had fallen 4 places in the ERM grid and
was classed as the weakest currency.
The belief that the peseta was ripe for devaluation was widespread in the
market, the only question being as to the timing.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, an economist at Citibank in London, believes there is
scope for a 5-10 per cent devaluation of the currency. He believes that the
official forecast of 1 per cent growth this year is optimistic, and that
there will be negative GDP of 0.5 per cent in 1993. 'There is a pressing
need in Spain to bring interest rates down to about 7 per cent in the third
quarter of this year from the current level of 15 per cent,' he said.
However, the peseta's weakness is seen as an isolated incident in the ERM.
Mr Steve Hannah, a director of IBJ International, said that the falls in
French and Danish money market rates in recent weeks are a sign of growing
confidence in the hard core of the system.
The other focus of attention yesterday was on the dollar which fell sharply
against the D-Mark following another poor US economic indicator.
Having failed to capitalise on Thursday's cut in the German discount rate,
the dollar was weakened by a 3.7 per cent fall in US durable goods orders.
The dollar bottomed out at DM1.5770 and later closed at DM1.5840, some 2
pfennigs down on the day.
Sterling was a touch stronger against both the D-Mark and the dollar
yesterday following stronger than expected retail sales figures for March.
These rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent, giving a year on year rise of
4.1 per cent. The pound closed at DM1.5840 from a previous DM1.6065. Mr
Avinash Persaud, an economist at UBS, believes the DM2.50 level will soon be
breached.

FT  24 APR 93 / Money Markets: Rates fall again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ

<TEXT>
THERE were continuing expectations of lower interest rates in parts of
Europe yesterday after the Bundesbank unexpectedly eased its discount rate
by 25 basis points at its council meeting on Thursday, writes James Blitz.
Following the German move, the Bank of France said that it was cutting its
intervention rate from 8.75 per cent to 8.50 per cent with effect from
Monday.
At the same time, it also cut its 5-10 day rate, the effective ceiling to
market rates, by 25 basis points to 9.50 per cent.
The move helped to push down French money market rates. One month French
francs dropped from about 9.30 per cent to around 8.40 per cent at the end
of the day. The June French franc contract rose 13 basis points at one
stage, but later closed a net 3 basis points up on the day at 92.01.
Inside Germany, the cost of cash also fell sharply to accommodate the new
structure of German rates. Call money was quoted at around 7.50 per cent at
the end of the day from a previous close of 7.80 per cent.
Dealers said the official rate cuts had combined with a surplus of liquidity
in the German banking system to bring the cost of call money down.
However, the easing of conditions in the German cash market coincided with a
sell-off in most Euromark futures contracts. The June contract fell 15 basis
points to close at 92.67. The September contract was down 17 basis points to
a close of 93.48.
One dealer said the sell-off reflected the belief that Thursday's rally had
been too euphoric. The easing of interest rates had also raised fears of
higher inflation in the bund market, leading to a fall in German bond prices
which had an impact on currency futures.
Conditions in the sterling cash market were very tight after the Bank of
England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.05bn. Bills were only offered in the
afternoon and the overnight rate peaked at 7.5 per cent. Three-month money
remained unchanged at around 6 per cent.
The June short sterling contract fell 9 basis points on the day, to close at
93.84. This followed speculation that base rates had bottomed at 6 per cent
following yesterday's stronger-than-expected retail sales figures for March
showing a 0.5 per cent increase on the month.

FT  24 APR 93 / International Company News: Executives at Amag resign after
heavy losses

   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE chief executive and deputy chief executive of Austria Metall (Amag), the
troubled Austrian aluminium company, have resigned following the publication
of heavy losses for 1992.
Amag, a subsidiary of Austrian Industries, the state-owned industrial
holding company, lost Sch5.4bn (Dollars 478m) last year on turnover of
Sch16.1bn.
Operating losses were Sch2.6bn and there were extraordinary charges of
Sch2.7bn arising from the closure of its sole remaining aluminium smelter in
Austria. In 1991, Amag had a pre-tax loss of Sch0.8bn.
The company said that operating losses were caused mainly by the collapse in
world aluminium prices. No improvement in results was foreseen this year.
It said that Mr Peter Apfalter, the chief executive, and his deputy, Mr Hans
Koopman, offered to resign following intense and unfair media criticism of
their management.
Amag's losses weighed heavily on Austrian Industries. AI this week reported
a net loss of Sch4.8bn for 1992 compared with a net profit of Sch95m in the
previous year. Its operating loss was Sch2.6bn compared with a Sch2.12bn
profit.
Mr Michael Sekyra, chief executive, said he hoped Amag would make profits at
the operating level this year, and he expected that government subsidies to
cover Amag losses would stay within the three-year budget, to the end of
this year, of Sch9.1bn.

FT  24 APR 93 / International Company News: Exxon earnings flat in first
three months
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXXON, the world's biggest integrated oil company, yesterday posted
essentially flat underlying earnings for the first three months of 1993.
Net income in the latest quarter was Dollars 1.19bn, or 94 cents a share,
including a one-time gain of Dollars 47m from asset sales and tax credits
outside the US. A year earlier, Exxon had net earnings of Dollars 1.3bn, or
Dollars 1.03, including non-recurring gains of Dollars 158m.
Revenues fell 2.3 per cent to Dollars 27.26bn from Dollars 27.91bn in the
first three months of 1992.
Mr Lawrence Rawl, outgoing chairman, said the company's reduced operating
expenses helped staunch earnings erosion in the quarter in spite of sluggish
economic conditions in Exxon's leading markets.
On Wall Street, shares in Exxon fell Dollars 1 5/8 to close at Dollars 64
1/4 yesterday.
During the first three months of 1993, Exxon benefited from higher crude oil
prices and higher sales of chemical products. On the other hand, petroleum
product and chemical margins were weak in the quarter.
Earnings from domestic exploration and production operations rose to Dollars
228m in the quarter from Dollars 125m a year earlier. Underlying earnings
from non-US exploration and production operations were Dollars 648m against
Dollars 699m last year.
Profits from refining and marketing operations in the US eased to Dollars
21m from Dollars 23m a year ago. Outside the US, refining and marketing
operations brought in earnings of Dollars 277m against Dollars 339m a year
ago, excluding one-time gains of Dollars 115m in 1992.
Exxon's chemical operations had income of Dollars 123m compared with Dollars
151m in the previous year.

NOMURA Securities, the leading Japanese securities house, plans to cut its
annual dividend to Y10 from Y15 a year earlier. It is the first reduction
since 1975 and a sign of the pressure on the broking industry.
The dividend announcement follows a forecast that the broker would report a
pre-tax profit of zero for the year ending last month on revenue of Y345bn
(Dollars 3.1bn), down from Y421bn in the previous year.
Yamaichi Securities, another member of Japan's Big Four brokers, said that
its annual dividend would be cut from Y5 to Y2.5.

Securities and Nikko Securities, have yet to make a dividend announcement.
None of the four is expecting a pre-tax profit for the year just ended and
only Nomura is expecting a slim Y2bn net profit. Nomura announced that
unrealised losses on securities holdings in March were Y12.1bn, less than
the expected Y15bn.
Japanese brokers were badly bruised by the generally weak turnover and
prices on the Tokyo market last year.

SOUTHAM, Canada's biggest newspaper group in which Mr Conrad Black's
Hollinger is a substantial shareholder, has halved its first-quarter loss
and dropped plans for a rights offer to raise CDollars 75m (USDollars
62.5m).
The quarter showed a loss of CDollars 7.2m, or 11 cents a share, down from
CDollars 15.3m, or 26 cents, a year earlier. Revenues totalled CDollars 272m
against CDollars 274m.
Southam has restructured its national newspaper chain, sold printing assets
and raised CDollars 180m for debt reduction by private placement of equity
with Power Corp of Canada.
The newspapers showed a small operating profit in the latest period compared
with a CDollars 4.1m loss. Advertising lineage was down 4.7 per cent on
average. Business communications were profitable.
Coles, the company's bookstore arm, lost CDollars 2m against a loss of
CDollars 1.6m, in spite of a 10 per cent increase in revenues to CDollars
43m.
Southam says that because of the private placement it no longer needs to
proceed with the rights offer. It expects to post a profit for 1993.
Hollinger has 18.8 per cent of Southam. It is in the throes of selling half
this stake for Pounds 72.3m (USDollars 111.34m) to The Telegraph UK
newspaper which is 68 per cent owned by Hollinger.

<TEXT>
SUMITOMO Bank and Fuji Bank, two of Japan's top commercial banks, yesterday
had their long-term debt downgraded by Moody's, the US credit rating agency,
to take account of exposure to the troubled property sector.
Moody's said that both banks, which were among the strongest in Japan, would
take time to reduce their bad debts and sell poor quality assets. It warned
that their profits would be dampened for several years by bad debts.
The downgrades confirm that in spite of action by commercial banks to reduce
their non-performing loans the banks will be dealing with their bad debts
for some time
In the past year, Moody's has downgraded the long-term debt of 10 of the 17
top Japanese banks that it rates. The banks with the best rating are DKB,
Mitsubishi Bank, Sanwa Bank and the Bank of Tokyo, which all have Aa3
rating.
Moody's lowered Sumitomo Bank's senior debt rating as well as its rating for
long-term deposits, from Aa3 to A1. The long-term ratings of the bank's
guaranteed international subsidiaries were lowered to A1 from Aa3.
Fuji Bank's long-term debt and deposits were downgraded to A1 from Aa3.
Moody's said it was due to Fuji's exposure to the non-bank sector as well as
construction and property lending which had soured.

FT  24 APR 93 / International Company News: Sulzer, Ebara seek pumps deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SULZER, the Swiss engin-eering group, is continuing discussions with Ebara
of Japan on a potentially important joint venture in pumps - more than a
year after the two began co-operation talks.
Sulzer is one of Europe's largest producer of pumps, and Ebara is the
dominant Japanese producer. A deal would represent a further step in the
rationalisation and globalisation of the world pump industry. Other big
players include Weir of the UK, KSB of Germany and the Ingersoll-Dresser
Pump joint venture in the US.
Dr Fritz Fahrni, Sulzer president and chief executive, said in London that
he hoped a deal could have been concluded by the end of last year.
He would not say why the talks were dragging on, or what form any
co-operation would take. It appears that a global combination of the two
pump businesses has not been ruled out.
Sulzer has pump factories at Leeds in England, Portland in Oregon, and in
Germany, France, the Netherlands, Mexico and South Africa.
Profits for the pump division, part of the Sulzer Escher Wyss group of
businesses, are not disclosed, but improved significantly last year. One
reason has been a strong turnround to profitability at the Leeds plant,
which employs 450 people and lost Pounds 1.3m (Dollars 2m) in 1990.
Dr Fahrni believes there is still room for further improvement in the pump
division's profits, which could be aided by a tie-up with Ebara.
He disclosed that Sulzer was to retain and develop its Thermtec valves and
control systems division for at least two years, following the collapse in
February of its sale to IMI, the British industrial group. The business was
non-core, he said, but could be damaged by any immediate attempt to find a
new purchaser.

FT  24 APR 93 / International Company News: Japan banks weakened by
appraisal losses on shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S leading banks yesterday announced large appraisal losses on their
securities portfolios as the effects of the weakness of the stock market
continued to echo through the financial system.
The losses, including Y39.7bn (Dollars 358m) at Mitsubishi Bank and Y45.6bn
at Sanwa Bank, and calculated at the close of the financial year last month,
would have been higher but for a rise in Tokyo stock prices following the
government's decision to pump extra pension and postal funds into the stock
market.
Several banks announced downward revisions of their forecast profits. The
results, to be formally announced next month, will reflect the stock
appraisal losses, as well as the increasing burden of provisions and
write-offs of non-performing loans.
Daiwa Bank indicated that pre-tax profits would fall about 10 per cent from
the forecast Y46bn, while Nippon Credit Bank, a long-term credit bank, said
profit was likely to have fallen 60 per cent over the year to Y28bn, down
from a previous forecast of Y37bn. Mitsubishi Bank said its profits 'will
show some decrease'.
Other banks to record large appraisal losses for the period were the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan with Y39.5bn, the Bank of Tokyo, Y36.8bn; the
Industrial Bank of Japan, Y36.3bn; and Sakura Bank, Y35.2bn.
The finance ministry expected banks to write down their portfolios every six
months, although the rule was waived for the Bank of Tokyo and the leading
trust banks last September, when stock prices were particularly weak.
Mitsui Trust and Banking, and Yasuda Trust and Banking have yet to announce
their losses, while Toyo Trust and Banking reported a Y22.8bn write-down,
Sumitomo Trust and Banking, Y19.6bn; Chuo Trust and Banking, Y14.3bn; and
Mitsubishi Trust and Banking, 10.5bn.
Japanese banks are fortunate that the decline in interest rates over the
year has lifted their operating profits, but rates are close to bottoming
and the banks will be under increasing pressure this year if share prices
resume their fall.
The 21 leading banks are expected to announce that non-performing loans at
the end of March were about Y15,000bn, up from Y12,300bn in September. The
new figure, representing about 4.8 per cent of total loans, does not
indicate the true burden.
In calculating this figure, the banks do not count the fast rising number of
loans on which interest rates have been cut to almost zero in an attempt to
support a troubled company.
Unofficially, Japanese banks' bad loans are estimated at Y30,000bn, but they
are being discouraged from large-scale write-offs by a nervous finance
ministry.

FT  24 APR 93 / Commodities (Week In The Markets): Russia underpins
palladium rise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE UPWARD trend in the market for palladium - a platinum group metal used
mainly in dentistry, the electrical industry and motor exhaust catalysts -
was underpinned late this week by a report that the biggest producer planned
to reduce output sharply.
An official of Russia's Norilsk, which produces palladium as a by-product of
nickel and accounts for nearly 70 per cent of the world's 3.6m tonnes-a-year
supply of the metal, was reported to have told a closed session of the
International Nickel Study Group in the Hague on Thursday that his country
would reduce nickel output by 10 or 12 per cent this year - and that would
inevitably result in a pro-rata cut in palladium production.
London traders were unsure, however, how much importance to attach to the
report, especially as it was unclear whether the reduction was being
measured against last year's actual output or this year's planned output.
'Norilsk has been talking about reducing output by about 10 per cent for a
year,' one dealer told the Reuter news agency. 'We are buying palladium on
the fundamentals, not Norilsk.' said another. 'Nobody wants to be short.'
The Norilsk report came when the palladium market was already in a
moderately bullish mood, reflecting supply tightness. The London price was
showing a rise since the end of last week of Dollars 2.75 a troy ounce,
extended yesterday to Dollars 5.50 when the price hit a 10-week high of
Dollars 118.25 an ounce.
The gold market also ended the week on an upbeat, with the London price
reaching a fresh six-month high of Dollars 344.15 an ounce, up Dollars 5.30
overall. Investment fund buying in New York and weakness of the US dollar,
which encouraged Middle Eastern buyers back into the market, prompted a
strong opening on the New York Commodity Exchange yesterday and enabled the
London market to push through the resistance that had frustrated earlier
attempts to breach the Dollars 342 barrier.
Like palladium, the nickel market was on the upgrade before the emergence of
the Norilsk factor. Chart patterns were looking encouraging, dealers said,
imports from the Commonwealth of Independent States were reported to be
falling, production of stainless steel was at a high level, supplies of
stainless steel scrap were tight and a substantial fall in London Metal
Exchange stocks was announced yesterday.
The nickel market's initial reaction to Thursday night's news was to push
the three months delivery price close to Dollars 6,200 a tonne. It eased
later, however, closing at Dollars 6,172.50 a tonne, up Dollars 95 on the
day and Dollars 235 up on the week.
Other LME metals had a less happy time. The copper market tried to
consolidate on Monday following the heavy falls of the last two weeks, but
Chinese sellers were quick to return and a fresh 5 1/2 -year low of Dollars
1,820 a tonne for three months metal was touched in mid-week. A subsequent
recovery ran into strong resistance at Dollars 1,920 a tonne and at
yesterday's close three months copper was quoted at Dollars 1,892 a tonne,
down Dollars 9 on the week.
Aluminium fared no better. A gentle price slide escalated into a technical
break-down on Thursday when support around the Dollars 1,125-a-tonne mark
for three months metal failed to hold and options-realted and stop-loss
selling forced the price down towards Dollars 1,100 a tonne. Buyers appeared
to defend that level yesterday and the price closed at Dollars 1,116.50 a
tonne, up Dollars 7 on the day and Dollars 17 down on the week.
Mr David Morton, chairman of Alcan Aluminium expects 'some improvement' in
ingot prices later this year, despite CIS exports reaching well over 1m
tonnes in 1993, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Present spot prices of about 50 US cents a lb (Dollars 1,100 a tonne) should
prove the low point, Mr Morton said after Alcan's annual meeting. 'I can see
54-56 US cents per lb late this year with somewhat better prices in 1994,'
he added.
Reynolds Metals chairman Mr Richard Holder last week forecast that aluminium
ingot would average 54 cents a lb this year. At that level North American
smelters would barely break even.
Alcan expects to continue operating at about 95 per cent of capacity in
North America and it sees the Japanese market picking up later this year.
However it is worried about Europe.
Overall world growth in demand should reach about 3.5 per cent, with China
becoming a market of growing importance. The short-term thrust in demand
will come from growing use of aluminium cans in Europe and Asia and
increasing use in car manufacture.
Alcan will spend about USDollars 450m this year, mostly to complete its
rolling mill expansions in Germany and the US. Together they will raise the
company's rolled products capacity by 50 per cent.
For investors in soft commodities sugar was the only bright spot this week.
Concern about tightening supplies on the world market helped the July
contract on the New York futures market up to 12.47 US cents a lb in late
trading yesterday, up 0.91 from last week.
London trade house C. Czarnikow estimated this week that the setbacks to
Thailand's sugar production that played a big part in driving up world
market prices earlier in the year would result in a 66 per cent reduction in
the country's output to 3.84m tonnes.

FT  24 APR 93 / UK Company News: Rewe buys 26% of Budgens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REWE, one of Germany's largest food retailers, has bought a 26 per cent
stake in Budgens, a small UK food retailing chain, in a move which could
step up the continental European assault on the discount end of British
retailing.
Rewe is a private company which operates 8,000 stores and has 15 per cent of
the German food market. Budgens has 100 supermarkets, mainly in the
south-east of England.
The German group paid Pounds 23.5m for the Budgens stake to BIL Securities,
the New Zealand investment company founded by Sir Ron Brierley.
BIL and other institutional investors ousted Budgens' management in 1991 and
installed a new German chief executive, Mr John von Spreckelsen. He has
brought the struggling chain back to profit, but doubts have persisted about
whether the group has a long-term future.
Mr Spreckelsen said he would 'look forward to developing the opportunities
that will inevitably arise from such a strong European connection'. He said
it was too early to say what Rewe intended, but they wanted to be supportive
shareholders and there was obvious scope for joint sourcing. The German
company will put a representative on the Budgens' board.
Rewe currently operates more than 1,400 discount grocery outlets called
Penny-Markt, as well as supermarkets and hypermarkets. Several continental
European discounters, attracted by the high profit margins available in UK
food retailing, have opened stores in the last three years, making
discounting the fastest-growing area of the UK food market.
Aldi, Germany's largest food discounter, opened its first stores in the UK
in 1990, followed quickly by Netto of Denmark. They now have 63 and 45
stores respectively and have announced expansion plans.
Carrefour, the French retail giant, opened its first Ed discount store in
Maidstone, Kent, in January, and there is speculation in the retail trade
that other continental European groups such as Germany's Tengelmann, Lidl &amp;
Schwartz, and Norma, are investigating the UK market.
Rewe paid BIL 55p each for the stake of 42.78m shares, a significant premium
to yesterday's opening price of 46p. Budgens shares closed 3p higher at 49p.
BIL paid an average of 32p per share, so it showed a paper profit of about
Pounds 10m on its investment.
Mr von Spreckelsen, who introduced the New Zealand-based company to Rewe,
said: 'BIL has been a very supportive shareholder. Their support for the
company, in particular during the restructuring phase in 1991, has been
outstanding. This said, we are delighted with Rewe's agreement to purchase
and welcome them as new partners.'

FT  24 APR 93 / UK Company News: Dollars 105m US buy for Bowater
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOWATER, the packaging and industrial films group, has acquired the Tower
Packaging business from Baxter Healthcare of the US, in a deal worth Dollars
105m (Pounds 68m) over five years.
Tower, based in Mundelein, Illinois, makes medical packaging and film
products, including surgical drapes, steriliseable bags and pouches,
supplying 85 per cent of its products to Baxter. Bowater has acquired both
its manufacturing licences and patents, and a long-term supply contract to
Baxter.
Bowater said the acquisition would strengthen its position in the world
healthcare market and complement its existing DRG medical packaging
business, which it acquired in 1992.
'This is bulls eye where we want to expand,' said Mr Michael Hartnall,
finance director. 'This is a high quality company with some good
technology.' Baxter decided to sell as part of its policy of reducing
vertical integration.
Of the consideration Dollars 65m is payable on completion and Dollars 10m in
each of the next four years. Although Tower's assets have a book value of
Dollars 27m, Mr Hartnall said the premium was accounted for by goodwill and
Tower's licences and patents, and he believed the price was a fair one.
It will be financed through debt, increasing gearing from 56 to just above
60 per cent, Mr Hartnall said.
Tower, which used to supply Baxter at or below cost, incurred an operating
loss of Dollars 2.6m last year. But Bowater said that had all of its 1992
sales been conducted on the new terms agreed with Baxter, turnover would
have been about Dollars 60m, with an operating profit of some Dollars 9m.
The deal is Bowater's second in three months. In February it announced the
Dollars 434m purchase of Specialty Coatings International, the US coatings
company, funded by a Pounds 295m rights issue. Last year it acquired DRG and
Cope Allman, the cosmetics and pharmaceuticals packaging group, largely
funded by a Pounds 333.5m rights issue.

FT  24 APR 93 / UK Company News: Hi-Tec remains in loss and plans Pounds 5m
restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HI-TEC Sports, the sportswear company, yesterday announced that it continued
to lose money in the second half of last year and said it would restructure
its European operations at a cost of about Pounds 5m.
One of Britain's largest sports shoe suppliers, Hi-Tec had hoped to return
to profit in the second half after announcing interim losses of Pounds 2.8m.
However, the company said that the second half would show a 'relatively
small' but 'disappointing' loss when it announces results next month.
The shares, which have collapsed from 207p last May as problems mounted,
dipped 1p to 42p. Analysts said the share price already reflected Hi-Tec's
problems. These included the sudden resignation last month of two recently
appointed non-executive directors, Sir Michael Edwardes, a former chairman
of British Leyland, and Mr Richard Fenhalls, former chief executive of Henry
Ansbacher.
No Hi-Tec officer was available to comment, but the company said in a
statement that its UK operations continued to suffer from pricing pressures.
The US division performed well.
In Europe, sports shoe operations had made 'substantial losses' and the
company said it planned important, but unspecified, changes. Analysts said
this could mean a withdrawal from some European markets and a greater use of
agents in Europe.
The company said these decisions had been taken before the year end and the
restructuring costs of Pounds 5m will be taken in last year's accounts.
Hoare Govett, Hi-Tec's corporate broker, was forecasting trading losses of
up to Pounds 3.5m for last year, but a profit of Pounds 5m this year.
Hi-Tec has also appointed Mr Peter Butler as group finance director, a
position left vacant since February. Mr Butler, a former chief financial
officer of property and agribusiness company Berisford, has been granted
400,000 options at 50p. These can be exercised at 80p or above in three
years time.
Hi-Tec was left without non-executive directors following the two
resignations, but is understood to be still trying to recruit replacements.

FT  24 APR 93 / UK Company News: Reed Executive optimistic as losses are
trimmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REED Executive, the employ-ment agency, slightly reduced pre-tax losses to
Pounds 7.33m in the year to December 27, compared with Pounds 7.89m in the
corresponding period.
Reed, which changed its year end from March to December, said turnover
dropped to Pounds 82.3m (Pounds 87.8m). The dividend was again passed and
losses per share were reduced to 11.2p (12.9p).
The company made an exceptional provision of Pounds 3.91m (Pounds 1.64m), to
cover surplus property costs associated with those vacated or sold, and
redundancies.
Reed had Pounds 633,000 worth of cash at the year end and no borrowings.
Mr Alex Reed, executive chairman, said: 'The really good news is that since
the beginning of this calendar year, losses have been reduced dramatically.'
Management accounts showed a loss of just Pounds 150,000 (Pounds 1.72m
losses) for the first three months, with a small profit in March.
He said he would be 'very disappointed' if the company failed to make a
profit this year, although the first half would probably be near breakeven.

FT  24 APR 93 / UK Company News: Russian crisis hits Moscow Narodny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOSCOW NARODNY, the London-based trade and project finance bank, suffered a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 321m last year because of the Russian economic
crisis, it emerged yesterday at the bank's annual meeting.
The shareholders, led by the Central Bank of Russia, were told that it made
provisions of Pounds 299m against doubtful loans in 1992, raising provisions
to 75 per cent of the book value of its loans in the former Soviet Union.
The loss is the largest declared by a UK bank for last year, outstripping
Barclays' Pounds 242m pre-tax loss. Although Moscow Narodny is owned by
Russian institutions, it is licensed and supervised by the Bank of England.
The bank said it believed it was now adequately provided for its exposure in
Russia, and believed that it would not need to raise the level this year.
Some of the Pounds 541m total provisions on its balance sheet might be
released.
Russia's state-owned Bank for Economic Affairs last year spent Pounds 147m
and Dollars 177m in hard currency on new preference shares to restore the
bank's capital. Combined with the fall in asset values, this has maintained
capital strength.
The bank's capital to risk-weighted asset ratio - a measure of capital
strength - fell from 46 per cent to 33 per cent but remains well above the
minimum of 8 per cent required by the Bank for International Settlements
guidelines.
Mr Eddie Khamoo, head of financial accounting, said the bank was now
well-capitalised and it was unlikely to have to raise provisions against
assets in the former Soviet Union this year even if economies deteriorated
further.
Mr Khamoo said some provisions had already been released, because Bank of
England guidelines on provisioning against Russian assets were strict.
'We were very prudent, and provisions are likely to go down this year,' he
said.
Mr AP Semikoz, the bank's chairman, said in the annual report that inflation
of 1,700 per cent and the fiscal deficit in Russia had reduced the bank's
assets net of prov-isioning in the former Soviet Union from Pounds 554m in
1991 to Pounds 279m.
The bank reported a 15 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds
12.3m. The loss before tax rose from Pounds 121m in 1991, while the post-tax
loss increased from Pounds 119m to Pounds 316m. It did not pay a dividend.

FT  24 APR 93 / UK Company News: Fitch losses widen to Pounds 3.9m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP RISE in exceptional provisions left Fitch, a provider of design
services, Pounds 3.98m in the red at the pre-tax level for the year to
end-December, against Pounds 417,000.
The exceptionals amounted to Pounds 2.43m (Pounds 1.18m) and related to
redundancies, unoccupied properties, property revaluation and expenses
connected with the financial restructure.
However, the directors said the benefits brought about by the restructuring
were both concrete and substantial. The balance sheet had been
'significantly reshaped and strengthened'.
A share suspension last year had affected the second half with turnover for
the year falling by 12 per cent from Pounds 18.1m to Pounds 15.92m, of which
Pounds 1.62 related discontinued activities. Losses per share were 31.9p
(9.4p) and again there is no dividend.

FT  24 APR 93 / UK Company News: Lopex bounces back and looks to resume
dividends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOPEX, the communications group, returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 210,000
in the year to end-December against previous losses of Pounds 398,000.
Directors do not recommend a dividend, but said they would propose a final
dividend for 1993 'in the absence of unforeseen circumstances'. The last
payment was a final for the 1990 year.
The preliminary results include a pro forma balance sheet adjusted for a
Pounds 3.5m rights issue in February this year, which moved cash up to
Pounds 7.89m (Pounds 4.35m), and the sale of its stake in a Dutch business.
Also long term obligations fell to Pounds 5.91m (Pounds 7.46m in the 1992
balance sheet) because of the conversion of a long term bonus for employees
into shares. Investments fell to Pounds 2.13m (Pounds 2.27m).
Turnover, which includes the cost of advertising space ultimately paid by
customers, fell to Pounds 146m (Pounds 206m). The company said stripping out
disposals the comparative figure for 1991 was Pounds 155m. Revenue -
commission on sales - fell to Pounds 41.1m (Pounds 58.7m).
Lopex made an exceptional provision for redundancy costs of Pounds 594,000
(Pounds 1.28m), partly offset by the release of a reorganisation provision
of Pounds 421,000.
It also made an extraordinary provision of Pounds 548,000 (gain Pounds
1.86m) covering the loss on sale or closure of discontinued operations,
including goodwill originally written off to reserves but included in the
acquisition considerations.
The company paid interest of Pounds 950,000 (Pounds 2.03m), but after
interest and dividends received the net charge was Pounds 693,000 (Pounds
1.49m). The company's share of profits in associated companies, less losses,
fell to Pounds 105,000 (Pounds 316,000).
The loss per share fell from 4.76p to 0.21p.

FT  24 APR 93 / UK Company News: Dissidents oust Etonbrook board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REBEL shareholders at Etonbrook Properties yesterday wrested control of the
former BES company from the board, ousted the directors and pledged
expansion with new capital.
The board's removal at an extraordinary meeting marked the climax of a
bitter 10-month struggle and a victory for property dealer Mr Andrew
Perloff, the rebel leader.
Shareholders with 51 per cent of the 2.9m voting shares backed nine
resolutions dismissing the board and appointing the rebel leaders as
directors.
Welcoming the result, Mr Perloff - who with his associates owns 29.9 per
cent of Etonbrook - said he hoped to provide 'an exit route' at 79p a share
for investors wishing to sell.
When he purchased a 19.4 per cent stake last summer, Mr Perloff paid 67p.
The shares closed down 2p yesterday at 77p.
Speaking after the meeting, Mr Perloff warned there was no guarantee that he
would now make a bid for Etonbrook.
He pledged instead to concentrate on generating income from the commercial
property and warehouse portfolio and told shareholders that bankers had
tentatively offered Pounds 10m to expand the business.
The outgoing board said the rebels had gained control 'by the backdoor' and
Mr Keith Moss, managing director, accused Mr Perloff of using the prospect
of negotiating an agreed takeover to dilute opposition to his moves.
'We should have fought more aggressively. Shareholders were waiting for an
agreed offer which wasn't forthcoming,' Mr Moss said. He also claimed the
rebels had used delaying tactics during talks on a general offer so that the
issue would not be resolved before yesterday's meeting, which was
requisitioned last month.
Fighting the rebel action had cost the company up to Pounds 250,000 and
prevented it from moving forward, he added.
Mr Perloff rejected the claims and blamed the delays on Etonbrook's failure
to agree terms and a decision by the Takeover Panel not to allow a two stage
takeover involving a partial offer at 79p followed by an offer for the rest
at a price and time to be agreed.
The new board, meanwhile, announced plans to embark on a detailed study of
Etonbrook's business and in particular its relationship with Palmerston
Investment Trust, which holds more than 1m preference shares.

FT  24 APR 93 / UK Company News: Serco wins US naval base contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MANAGEMENT contract for Diego Garcia, the US Naval base in the Indian
Ocean which was used during the Gulf war, has been awarded to a consortium
including Serco, the British facilities and project management company.
The seven-year contract, worth Dollars 160m (Pounds 103m), also covers
support sites. The consortium is led by Burns and Roe Services of the US.
But as Diego Garcia is British territory, at least 20 per cent of the
contract has to be awarded to a British company.
Mr David Perkins, Serco's finance director, said it had less than a third of
the contract, worth only Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m a year in turnover, but it
was Serco's first large contract with the US military. Its shares jumped 38p
to 988p.

FT  24 APR 93 / UK Company News: Floating in on the crest of a wave - OGC's
imminent plans for a stock market quote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OGC International, an Aberdeen-based contractor which provides construction
and project management services to oil and gas companies in the North Sea,
is to be floated with a market value of about Pounds 75m.
Its parent, Fairhaven International, the specialist oil contractor
controlled by Mr Fred Olsen, the Norwegian shipping magnate, is retaining a
60 per cent stake in the company.
Fairhaven wants to invest part of the proceeds in its US onshore
construction business. As a Bermudan-registered company quoted in London, it
also had strong advance corporation tax incentives for floating, since UK
investors were subject to double taxation on their dividends.
The 40 per cent stake in OGC which is being offered for sale comprises 24m
ordinary shares, half of which will be firmly placed with institutions, and
half offered to private investors. In the light of the success of recent
flotations, the Stock Exchange insisted that the retail element be increased
to 50 per cent of the offer.
OGC's principal operating subsidiary, AOC, was established in 1976. Its
original expertise lay in managing the 'hook-up' stage of a platform's
construction, when life-support, drilling, oil and gas processing equipment
are brought together to begin production.
Since the mid-eighties, the company has moved towards doing more
modification and safety-related work in the post-production stage. In 1989,
OGC made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.6m on sales of Pounds 76.21m. A surge
of investment in new platforms and improved safety at the start of the
nineties saw last year's pre-tax profits reach Pounds 10.5m on sales of
Pounds 226.6m.
The recent slump in rig construction and the Budget's changes in the
petroleum revenue tax regime might appear an inauspicious background for
this flotation, but OGC is confident the North Sea will offer solid growth
opportunities for years to come.
Mr John Hyslop, OGC's managing director, said the taxation changes had
favoured the bigger oil companies with established fields, his group's main
customers. There were now greater incentives to extend the life of existing
fields with new equipment and exploit marginal fields by hooking them into
established platforms - installations which OGC had specialised in.
OGC concedes there is a longer-term threat posed to North Sea activity by
the downturn in rig building and the changes in PRT, which mean that
exploration costs can no longer be offset, but believes there will be no
shortage of opportunities in the medium term - and in any case the taxation
regime is likely to change again. Mr Hyslop said: 'Oil companies still have
substantial plans - they are talking about bringing 50 new fields into
production before the end of the century.'
Opportunities also exist beyond the British sector of the North Sea. In
September OGC acquired what it described as a 'toehold' in Norway through a
joint venture. The company hopes to get a bigger share of work in that
sector as the Norwegians become less protectionist in their approach to EC
membership.
The UK group is involved on hook-up work on a platform off western Australia
and has formed a joint venture to bid for work in Malaysia. It intends to
use Australia as a marketing base for a push into the Pacific Rim countries,
which have the world's fastest-growing market for oil and gas services.
OGC has no plans to work in the US, which is Fairhaven's main focus of
interest. Fairhaven has undertaken not to compete with the UK group in
either the geographic or business areas in which OGC currently operates.
Nearer to home, OGC hopes that its close working relationship with the major
oil and gas companies could lead to more onshore work. The group has already
worked on the expansion of BP's oilfield at Wytch Farm in Dorset and Total's
gas terminal at St Fergus in north-east Scotland.
Mr Hyslop believes that the safety and timetable disciplines which OGC has
learned to work to offshore could easily be transferred to doing safety and
maintenance work in onshore sites such as petrochemical plants.
Last year OGC had an average of more than 4,000 employees, comprising about
150 in management and administration and the rest project personnel on
contracts. The group also maintains a computerised register of about 25,000
personnel.
After the flotation, which is being sponsored by UBS, the UK company will
receive payment of a Pounds 6m inter-company loan from Fairhaven, which will
leave OGC with net cash in its balance sheet.
The price of OGC's shares will be set on May 7, the offer will close on May
19 and dealing is expected to begin on June 1.
Last year the group earned 10.9p per share, but turnover was boosted by an
exceptionally high level of activity in the North Sea. The price is likely
to be adjusted to reflect that, but a fairly modest multiple of 12 times
earnings would value the shares at about 130p and the group as a whole at
Pounds 78m.

FT  24 APR 93 / Letter: View on health service moves misguided
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID BLUNKETT MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial on private finance and the National Health Service
(April 22) shows uncharacteristic naivete. I was particularly surprised by
your description of Labour's response to government plans as 'depressing'
and 'reflex', since my statement on behalf of the Labour party did seek to
draw a distinction between the positive role to be played in the NHS by
expanded leasing-type arrangements and the problems associated with handing
over key healthcare services to the private sector. Schemes must be judged
on their merits and their effect on healthcare, both short and long term.
To suggest as you do that the government's latest moves will begin to
unleash new investment while protecting the NHS is simply misguided. It is
true that Treasury pressure to cut public spending on health, while
apparently increasing 'real resources', is driving ministers to seek more
private finance. But in seeking to square this financial circle they are
deliberately creating conditions for key NHS functions to be gradually
handed over to companies operating outside the NHS.
The FT may approve, but I believe such a path will inevitably lead to a
two-tier service and the erosion of free and comprehensive healthcare.
Something far more ideological is happening to Tory health policy than you
suggest. For evidence, I suggest that your readers examine the full text of
junior health secretary Tom Sackville's speech or the pamphlet on this topic
by David Willetts MP - the real agenda is not far from the surface.
With all this in mind I await with interest the speech by the health
secretary, Mrs Bottomley, to the Confederation of British Industry next
month (since she seems completely unwilling to say anything to parliament on
this topic). I suspect that my worst fears will be confirmed.

shadow health secretary,

FT  24 APR 93 / Letter: New approach is needed to art collecting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER STILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read Susan Moore's report, The hammer falls on Spink, with interest,
(April 22). There are a number of comments I would like to make.
The growth of interest in the fine and decorative arts over the past decades
has been a global phenomenon. However, despite this, art finance has lagged
behind.
The art world's most precious commodity is confidence and that can only be
sustained by making the fine and decorative arts more accessible and
understood.
Due to an emphasis on auction sales, distortions in some art markets have
taken place with the bubble bursting, as Susan Moore suggests, at the end of
the 1980s. This unsatisfactory state of affairs demands a new approach to
art collecting for the 1990s and beyond.
For it is only when the financial risk in the acquisition and disposal of
fine art and antiques has been minimised that one can derive the maximum
enjoyment from them. The answer is objective information and sound
investment strategies with access to the latest financial instruments.

FT  24 APR 93 / Test plan fails to make the grade: Britain's schools face a
summer of discontent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ruling by the UK Appeal Court yesterday that union action against school
tests in England and Wales is not illegal presents Mr John Patten, the
education secretary, with an uncomfortable choice.
He could persevere with the compulsory national curriculum tests which have
aroused the intense opposition of teachers and led to the current threats of
industrial action. That might throw the classrooms of England and Wales into
chaos for the rest of this summer, as teachers boycott the tests, some heads
and governors try to implement them and the hapless parents are left not
knowing where their children stand.
Or Mr Patten could concede that the tests - which he admits are flawed  -
should be voluntary pending the review he has ordered into the national
curriculum and its testing procedures. This would mean abandoning the
testing programme for this year. While such a climbdown might appeal,
ministers fear it would be seen as a defeat on the principle of a national
curriculum and nationwide testing.
If Mr Patten decides to press ahead with the tests, he can expect no help
from the courts. The Appeal Court ruled that the boycott on work connected
with the curriculum tests, already started by the National Association of
Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, is a legal trade dispute.
By linking the boycott to workloads, the NASUWT, one of two TUC-affiliated
teachers' unions, has therefore found a formula for legal industrial action
against the tests. A similar formula has been adopted in ballots now being
held by the National Union of Teachers, the UK's largest teaching union, and
the moderate Association of Teachers and Lecturers, which is not
TUC-affiliated. The NUT seems certain to vote for a boycott, while the ATL
is likely to follow.
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the NUT, said: 'Teachers will be
delighted at the court's decision. They know the impact this irrelevant
government imposed system of testing and assessment has had on their
workload.'
In the face of action from all three unions, the tests could not start in
most schools. Only members of the Professional Association of Teachers,
which refuses to take any industrial action, would be left to implement them
 -and the PAT has no members in many schools.
A long hot summer in the classroom therefore seems unavoidable.
Threats of other forms of legal force would probably only provoke teachers
further. Mr Patten appears to have abandoned plans to make the boycotts
illegal by changing legislation. Such a strategy would be difficult to
implement and could provoke broader conflict with other unions.
His tactic at present is to apply pressure to head teachers and school
governors, who are under a statutory duty to implement the tests.
However, this risks alienating two groups whose co-operation is essential if
testing is to succeed. Mr John Sutton, general-secretary of the Secondary
Heads Association, commented that heads do not need to be lectured by Mr
Patten on their duty, while Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National
Association of Head Teachers, believes the government's tactics 'smack of a
macho approach'.
Both organisations believe the tests are flawed and it is difficult to see
how they could be forced to implement them.
Pressure on school governors would also be an ineffective weapon. The
National Association of Governors and Managers has believed for some time
that the tests should be made voluntary, and reacted angrily to Mr Patten's
suggestion that they should enforce them.
Mr Walter Ulrich, NAGAM's information officer, predicted 'mass resignations'
if governors were pressurised to implement the tests, pointing out that they
are unpaid and have nothing to lose by resigning. Exerting such pressure
would also undermine the government's drive to encourage more parents to be
governors.
Parents, alarmed that their children could be judged on the basis of flawed
tests, also seem to be siding with teachers. In some parts of the country,
such as London, teachers unions claim that parents are threatening to
withdraw children from school on testing days. The National Confederation of
Parent Teacher Associations is calling for the tests to be abandoned.
This leaves Mr Patten without an ally. The entire educational establishment,
usually fractious and given to back-biting, is now in entrenched opposition
to the tests.
For the secretary of state, this is all uncomfortably reminiscent of what
happened in Scotland, where the combined opposition to testing of teachers
and parents forced the Scottish Office to make similar tests voluntary.
Worse, Mr Patten may now have painted himself into such a tight corner that
the Scottish solution of making the tests voluntary could no longer be
presented as a compromise. The stakes have risen too high to prevent such a
move being perceived as a humiliating climbdown.
But if the introduction of the national curriculum, and the testing which
accompanies it appears to have been mishandled, not all of the fault is Mr
Patten's.
The unwieldy form which the national curriculum has now taken on - a primary
source of opposition among teachers and even supporters of the government's
reforms - is partly the responsibility of Mr Kenneth Baker, the education
secretary who introduced the national curriculum.
The overloading of the national curriculum was exacerbated when one of Mr
Baker's successors, Mr Kenneth Clarke, imposed league tables on schools, to
be based on the test results. This meant that the tests were supposed to
work as a yardstick for schools' performance, as well as providing a
diagnostic tool for parents, and a broad indicator of national standards - a
recipe for the unwieldy tests which resulted.
But Mr Patten has further alienated teachers, not least by his apparent
aloofness and refusal - until quite recently - to meet any unions.
His stress on a moral, or value-laden approach to teaching has not helped.
Teachers unions believe this is a distraction. Yesterday, he devoted the
bulk of his speech at the Secondary Heads' Association to a talk on the
duties of parents to ensure, among other things, that children did their
homework on time. Other examples include his insistence that sex tuition
should be given a 'moral dimension' and that children should be educated in
'standard English' and corrected when they speak ungrammatically.
Mr Patten has made concessions, but they have proved too little too late to
persuade teachers to vote against boycotts in the current round of ballots.
Results of the tests for English, which have aroused the most ire, will not
now be published on a school-by-school basis. He has also announced a
subject-by-subject review of the entire national curriculum by Sir Ron
Dearing, former post office chairman and an impartial figure, rather than
one of the right-wing educationalists who pioneered the reforms.
Mr Patten was also relying on the law to bail him out by forcing the
teachers' unions to abandon their boycotts, and defuse the issue while the
reviews continued. This hope was not unreasonable, since the tests are laid
out as a statutory duty. Indeed, three moderate unions were advised by a
leading, left-leaning barrister that a test boycott would not survive a
legal challenge.
That hope has proved false, leaving Mr Patten to face his unpalatable
choice. What seems certain, is that this summer's tests will either be
reduced to a shambles, or they will not happen at all.

Sir, 'Company chiefs accused of greed' said your headline (April 19). The
'greed is good' culture, illustrated by some of the corporate excesses of
recent years and so tellingly shown, albeit partly tongue-in-cheek, in the
US movie Wall Street, is further 'hyped' by so many articles in the
financial press which say that the chairman of company A or the chief
executive of company B last year earned Pounds Xm. In the vast bulk of cases
they did not 'earn' that sum, they just happened to have been 'paid' it.

FT  24 APR 93 / Rough road to journey's end: The future of Abta is uncertain
despite its record of success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 2,000 British travel industry managers converging on Majorca today for
the 41st convention of the Association of British Travel Agents could be
forgiven for interspersing their wining, dining and networking with a little
self-congratulation.
Abta's system of financial protection has ensured that no package tourist
has lost money through the collapse of a travel company for nearly two
decades. A Mori survey of package holidaymakers last year found that 91 per
cent had heard of Abta.
Despite this success, many attending the convention believe Abta needs
radical change. Some of the largest tour operators and travel agents warn
that if Abta does not become a much smaller and more focused organisation,
they will leave.
They argue that Abta represents too many, often conflicting, interests:
aggrieved consumers; large mass-market tour operators; small operators
selling specialised holidays; travel agents with 600 outlets, as well as
those with only one. Mr Mike Grindrod, Abta president, says the association
finds itself representing holidaymakers with complaints, while providing
legal assistance to the companies against whom the complaints are directed.
While some in the industry have voiced these concerns in the past, two
recent developments have convinced many that Abta cannot continue as before.
The first is the growth of the three largest travel companies - Thomson,
Owners Abroad and Airtours. All have their own charter airlines. Thomson and
Airtours own Lunn Poly and Pickfords Travel, two of the UK's largest travel
agents' chains. Owners Abroad has links with travel agents Thomas Cook.
Several executives with large companies believe they are so well known that
their customers do not need the added reassurance of the Abta symbol on
their brochures and in their offices.
The second development is an EC directive which makes financial protection
for package travellers a legal requirement, rather than a voluntary
arrangement set up by groups such as Abta. All companies, whether Abta
members or not, must now ensure customers can be repatriated or have their
money refunded in the event of corporate collapse.
However, the UK government's implementation of the directive, which came
into effect this year, has been criticised for not providing sufficiently
strong consumer protection. Companies which do not belong to Abta can make
their own insurance arrangements if they wish. These will be policed by
trading standards officers who, Abta says, do not have the experience to
judge whether the insurance is sufficient.
However imperfect the new rules are, Mr Grindrod believes they signal the
end of a 28-year-old arrangement known as 'stabiliser', which meant that
Abta tour operators could sell their holidays only through Abta travel
agents. Travel agents, in turn, would only sell Abta members' holidays. In
1982, the Restrictive Practices Court ruled that 'stabiliser' was in the
interest of consumers because all the companies involved subjected
themselves to Abta's financial monitoring and had bonds to protect customers
in the case of collapse.
Mr Grindrod says because the new rules require all package travel companies,
whether Abta members or not, to arrange financial protection for their
customers, the courts are unlikely to allow 'stabiliser' to continue.
Mr Noel Josephides, chairman of the Association of Independent Tour
Operators (Aito), says: 'If tour operators want to sell holidays through a
supermarket or an estate agent, there will be nothing to stop them.'
Although the future of Abta will be the subject of intense discussion at the
Majorca convention, no decision will be made until June, when members will
vote on a proposal to streamline the association. If carried, Abta would
cease to be a trade association attempting to reconcile its members' diverse
aspirations. On policy issues, companies would be represented by more
specialised associations, such as Aito, the National Association of
Independent Travel Agents and the Tour Operators' Study Group, which
represents large operators.
Abta members would still have to have bonds to protect customers but, in
most cases, these would be arranged through other travel organisations.
Members would have to abide by Abta's code of conduct which, in some cases,
would be more stringent than required by law. For example, Mr Grindrod says
that while travel companies are not legally obliged to have insurance
against claims of negligence brought by travellers, Abta will require its
members to do so. Abta will still deal with consumer complaints.
Opposition to the change comes largely from small travel agents. Mr Brian
Cooke, managing director of Mersea Travel, with three shops in the south and
east of England, wonders why members want to reduce the role of an
organisation which is so well-known. 'A lot of subscription money has gone
into building a symbol which is recognised around the world,' he says.
A senior executive with a large travel group says that while the Abta symbol
is valuable it is not worth the membership fees that companies have to pay.
Annual subscriptions for the largest companies go up to Pounds 35,000.
Membership fees of a reformed Abta are expected to be far lower.
It is difficult to say which way the vote will go. If the reform proposal is
defeated, some of the large members will probably resign. Mr Kevin Welsh,
sales and marketing director of Pickfords Travel, says: 'Given what we pay
under the existing model, we would have to question whether it's in our best
interest to continue membership.'
Mr Cooke accepts that defeat of the reform proposal could mean that only the
smaller travel agents would remain. He believes Abta would then become an
even more effective representative of smaller companies. Whatever the result
of the June vote, the next convention will be that of a markedly different
organisation.

FT  24 APR 93 / Consuming passion of Chinese shoppers: The sudden
availability of imported goods has led to a spending spree by workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Young Mr Yang had no qualms about spending Dollars 50 on a pair of imported
blue jeans, a month's salary for the average Chinese worker. Shopping this
week at Beijing's smart, new Yaohan department store with its Gucci corner
was, he declared, 'chic'.
Mr Yang, who described himself as an entrepreneur - a new class of cash-rich
Chinese - was doing what millions of well-heeled young consumers do the
world over. The difference in China is that opportunities for western-style
consumerism have been extremely limited.
That is now changing rapidly, and the Yaohan store on Beijing's main
boulevard is one of dozens of emporiums opening throughout China, offering a
big range of imported items that have become status symbols in
class-conscious Chinese society.
Producers of 'brand-name' goods, who have long coveted the huge China
market, are now flocking to the country in the hope of securing a niche.
Among British companies seeking a stronger presence are Dunhill and Johnnie
Walker.
The stark contrast between the Yaohan emporium and the neighbouring
state-run Friendship Store reveals the enormous shift that is taking place
in Chinese consumer patterns. Since it opened its doors in the early 1970s,
the Youyi Shangdian was the place to shop in Beijing. Access was restricted
to foreigners and a Chinese elite with foreign currency.
Ironically, the store, which had a virtual monopoly on items that foreigners
might wish to purchase, was not very friendly at all. Staff exhibited a
surly fuwu taidu, or service attitude, and little imagination was applied
either to the display or range of goods for sale. Competition from the
Yaohan store across the road and other modern shops has obliged the
Soviet-style Friendship Store to become more competitive, and almost
friendly, although old habits among the staff die hard.
The management is finding the going tough, and is even talking about holding
sales, something that would once have been quite unthinkable. It has also
been obliged to open the store to the masses who were previously held back
by stern guards and an iron railing.
Said Mr Dai Zhi Guo, one of the store's managers: 'In order to survive in
the sea of competition and business, we must open our doors.' A sign of the
tougher times are attempts to sell off the pair of giant ornamental bronze
lions that 'guard' the entrance, and have come to be regarded over the years
as the store's trademark. Asked whether selling the lions - a price tag of
Yn800,000 (Dollars 140,000) has been attached to one - is not a bit like
pawning the family silver, Mr Dai replied: 'Actually, we regard these lions
as commodities.'
At the Yaohan, where smiling and helpful shop assistants operate in a modern
environment, the contrast could hardly be greater. Business is brisk, the
store is crowded and, if there is a problem, it is maintaining stocks. Among
the frustrations of shopping in Beijing these days is that household items
and electronic equipment sell out quickly, such is the weight of consumer
demand. Items available one day are gone the next. There is hardly time to
browse.
A recent survey by the Hong Kong office of McKinsey's, the management
consultants, forecast that if China's economic growth continued to surge, a
target consumer population - those with annual income exceeding Dollars
1,000 - would grow from the present 60m to 200m by the year 2000, making it
a huge market by any standards. Chinese consumers tend to have a relatively
high percentage of disposable income, since housing, transport, education,
and health costs are still heavily subsidised, although the authorities are
intent on gradually phasing out subsidies.
Mr Li Wei, a senior manager at the Yaohan - the store is part of a Japanese
chain with outlets throughout Asia, in north and south America and in Europe
 -said that on average between 50,000 and 80,000 customers passed through
the store each day, with a peak of 150,000 earlier this year. Mr Li still
cannot quite believe that the store is proving such a success, or that
Chinese consumers will be able to afford imported items. 'I never expected
to see things develop so rapidly. It's unbelievable,' he says.
News this week that a state-controlled Beijing real estate developer is
planning a Dollars 1bn commercial redevelopment of one of the city's main
shopping streets is yet another indication of anticipated rewards from
satisfying pent-up consumer demand - bearing in mind that for decades the
Chinese were deprived of quality items from abroad and had to make do with
shoddy local products. But that, too, is changing. Chinese-made goods have
improved, although styling still remains deficient in many cases.
The Friendship Store itself is due for a big redevelopment. Mr Dai said
negotiations with a Hong Kong developer were in their final stages and he
expected some Dollars 250m to be spent on redeveloping the store site,
extending floor space from 9,000 square metres to 65,000 over five years.
This pattern is being repeated in cities and towns throughout China, with
old stores receiving facelifts, or being pulled down and replaced by joint
venture projects. Nanjing road, Shanghai's main shopping street, is a good
example of the rapid changes under way. Since the beginning of the year,
Hong Kong's Sincere department store group has opened an emporium in Nanjing
Road, and other outlets have appeared such as Benetton and Stefanel, among
others carrying famous brand names.
At the Yaohan store, meanwhile, young Chinese seem enraptured by the
Aladdin's Cave in which they find themselves; and even though relative to
salaries - average annual per capita income in China is about Dollars 350 -
prices are extremely high, many seem determined to buy, if only as a token
of their visit to a consumer wonderland.
Typical was Miss Wei, who was visiting Beijing from a provincial town where
gleaming temples of consumerism have not yet appeared. 'I've been here twice
before, but both times I left empty-handed. This time, I'll surely buy
something - a pair of stockings at least - even if I have to grit my teeth
to do it.'

<TEXT>
Sir, How sad that a Financial Times reader (J G Freeland, Letters, April
17-18) should so lack either a sense of humour or a sense of proportion that
a couple of witty items by Michael Thompson-Noel should make him 'see red'.
I, on the other hand, found the two pieces that offended him so entertaining
that I extracted them from the paper for the benefit of any friends or
relatives who may have been away or missed them for some reason on
publication. Michael Thompson-Noel is consistently one of the most rewarding
of columnists. Mr Freeland may well be right about '. . . a mediocre
England' and the barbarians being at the gates. But the reason for this can
be found in the greed and hypocrisy of the appalling 1980s and can hardly be
laid at the door of unfortunate reporters of our decline, much though he may
castigate members of a profession he finds distasteful.

Sir, I feel compelled to write a few words in support of Michael
Thompson-Noel following the outraged letter from J G Freeland (April 17-18).
I admit that Mr Thompson-Noel is often outrageous and was wrong to attribute
blanket low intelligence to National Hunt supporters (Hawks &amp; Handsaws,
April 10-11). After all, whatever it should be, intelligence is no guarantee
against sensitive behaviour.
Notwithstanding, Mr Thompson-Noel has made me laugh aloud spontaneously more
times than Mr John Major and he conveys to me the impression of someone
genuinely disturbed by the poor health of our society and the archaic and
often disreputable nature of many of our institutions. Long may his
idiosyncratic imagination flourish, and away with Mr Freeland's complacency.

FT  24 APR 93 / Leading Article: Prelude to recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIME minister's troubles are not over, not by any means, but the worst
may be behind him. The outlook for Mr John Major this spring is less gloomy
than at any time since Black Wednesday. He may not regain all of his
previous authority for a while, perhaps not ever, but his chances of
survival are high. The evidence that he is out of the woods, or nearly so,
is mounting.
The UK economy is recovering. Mr Major cannot honestly claim the full credit
for this. He opposed - indeed condemned out of hand - the policy change that
made recovery possible. He failed to understand why it was impossible under
the policy he did prefer. But he did have the wit to seize the opportunity
given by sterling's abrupt and expensive exit from the ERM last September.
If the prime minister was not particularly wise, he has at least proved to
be lucky. Monetary easing has been so sharp that some sort of recovery was
inevitable. Today the signs are everywhere: in the housing market, in retail
sales, in industrial output and even in unemployment. The upsurge may well
prove steeper than was supposed by most forecasters, including the Treasury,
earlier this year.
Luck cannot be relied upon, however, especially where British economic
recoveries are concerned. Too many have ended in the same painful way, with
excess consumption, balance of payments crises and rising inflation. The
danger facing Mr Major is not that there will be no return to growth, but
that it will not last.
Export-led growth
The British economy has the lowest underlying rate of inflation for close to
a generation. But it also has close to the largest ever fiscal deficit in
peacetime and a substantial current account deficit at the end of a deep
recession. The government needs fast growth to provide a painless cure for
the fiscal deficit, while such growth would exacerbate the external deficit.
The way out must be export-led growth. But export-led growth means growth
without soaring real wages. It means resisting excessive appreciation of
sterling, if necessary by cutting interest rates again. It means closing the
fiscal deficit aggressively. Above all, it means that this recovery must not
end in a spurt of wage inflation. Does Mr Major have the mettle to achieve
all this?
On past form the answer is, once again, mixed. The bill to ratify the
Maastricht treaty is past the most difficult portion of its passage through
parliament. It may yet suffer a reverse, but that looks unlikely. This is a
tribute to the prime minister's persistence. A long drawn-out and
debilitating episode that threatened to split the Conservative party is
drawing to a successful close. It may not have been magnificently managed,
but it has been managed. To mark the moment, Mr Major has embarked on a
series of speeches that promote the positive aspects of Britain's membership
of the European Community. Little that he has said is likely to play well on
the Continent, but the endeavour may contribute to an aura of renascent
leadership at home.
Challenges ahead
The pits closure episode is another case in point. The initial announcement
that 31 coal mines were to be shut down at once was an error of judgment,
for which Mr Major as well as the industry secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine,
was rightly blamed. During the ensuing months it looked as if this might
result in a wholesale retreat. In the event the government has saved most of
its original strategy, albeit at a high cost in temporary subsidies. A trial
of a similar nature is now about to be endured by Mr John Patten, the
education secretary, as he wrestles with teachers who threaten to boycott
tests of their pupils' performance under the national curriculum.
Other possible setbacks lie ahead. Liberal Democrats are the current
favourites to capture Newbury from the government in the forthcoming
by-election. That would further shave the government's already unreliable
majority in the Commons. If the Danes surprise everyone by voting No to
Maastricht in the referendum on May 18 the UK cabinet is likely to be
divided about what to do next. Meanwhile the government's agonising over
Bosnia, while understandable, does not enhance its reputation. As to later
in the year, the government is already in retreat from privatising the Post
Office and equalising the pension age; rail privatisation may prove to be
what one of its critics has called 'poll tax on wheels.'
If the prime minister is to restore confidence in his ability to take
difficult decisions he must first end the present uncertainty about who, if
anyone, is to be reshuffled in his cabinet. Ministerial nervousness is
contributing to a stultifying of the government's will to act. Mr Major has
demonstrated his loyalty to his chancellor for long enough. The employment
secretary has not been a success; the secretary for social security is not
grasping any nettles. The foreign secretary should be kept in post as long
as possible. Some cabinet ministers should go; some should be moved to new
posts. A strong, reconstituted, and credible team is sorely needed.

FT  24 APR 93 / President's work in progress: In his first 100 days in
office, Clinton has seemed determined to prove government can make a
difference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rush to judgment is now a permanent sprint. Bill Clinton's presidency
was pronounced irrevocably dead - and alive - even before he assumed office,
in its first days and round the clock, on the half hour, ever since. This
has been more than usually evident this week, with 86 dead in the ashes of a
religious fanatic's fortress in Texas, a jobs bill killed by 43 obdurate
Republican senators and with a nation now conditioned to demand to know who
was at fault.
But a presidency - as well as the political and national contexts in which
it operates - is a permanent work in progress. Hindsight can always identify
watersheds - Jimmy Carter's 'malaise' speech in the summer of 1979 and
George Bush's approval of the 1990 budget act increasing taxes can now be
said to have definitively marked the beginning of the end of their
presidencies. But Mr Clinton's first 100 days, a mere one-fifteenth of his
first term and one-thirtieth of what he might serve, are only up next week.
Had he promised a rose garden, he would by now only have been able to
deliver a few buds.
But even these demonstrate the enormous gulf between Mr Clinton and his
predecessor, above all domestically. Mr Bush thought everything could be set
to rights by a balanced budget amendment, the line item veto and a
conservative Supreme Court, of which he had only the latter and then not
consistently. It is, on the other hand, hard to imagine a problem, no matter
how small, to which Mr Clinton could not come up with a programmed solution
and even a means, probably a tax, to pay for it. And he will get the chance
substantially to reshape the nation's highest court.
Government, in the Clinton doctrine, can make a difference. It may, as he
frequently says, have to 'get by on less', and its pockets, even in the
great cause of aiding Russian reform, may not be too deep. But this does not
invalidate its mission to lead by example and, where necessary, to
intervene.
Thus, the first 100 days have been phenomenally busy. The single great
achievement has been the passage by Congress of the broad outlines of the
plan to cut the budget deficit substantially over the next five years. The
truly hard parts - enacting specific tax increases and cutting spending
programme by programme - still lie ahead, but the fact remains that for the
first time since 1985 a president has proposed a budget that is not
automatically 'dead on arrival' on the steps of the Capitol. It is even
possible that Congress will improve on it and cut spending even more.
But this has not been all. Also at home, Mr Clinton, under his wife's
direction, has got stuck into the momentous issue of healthcare reform, with
serious proposals due perhaps next month. He struck down Republican
restrictions on abortion and in the labour market, obtained a family leave
bill, committed himself to ending the ban on homosexuals serving in the
military, instituted easier bank lending to small businesses, inserted the
government into technological research and development, set up a civilian
national service corps, mediated in the trees-versus-spotted owls dispute,
promised to sign the international bio-diversity treaty, and more besides.
He has run a thousand hares already and if few are radical in themselves the
collective impression is of a man determined to change the way the country
looks at itself and what it thinks it can do for itself. It is an agenda as
ambitious as the ideological Reagan revolution it is intended to reverse.
All it lacks is the single-minded focus of the first Reagan term, opposition
to which was made in any case almost impolite by the president's own brush
with an assassin's bullet.
There have been setbacks, the most telling of which was this week's defeat
of the jobs bill at the hands of a Congress run by Democrats. This was not
supposed to happen in the first flush of Clinton's presidency and so soon
after the great budget victory. The package may be dismissed as economically
insignificant - at Dollars 16bn it is one-tenth of the size of that just
proposed by Japan - but its demise in its proposed form serves as a potent
reminder to the new president that working on Congress is a full-time
occupation.
Successful presidents instil a mixture of fear and respect into Congress. So
far Mr Clinton has earned respect for his marketing abilities but has not
generated fear. He was unable to scare off the Republican filibuster, itself
a remarkable display of solidarity by a party in search of a role and
nervous of being blamed for yet more gridlock. Somehow the White House has
to learn to overcome its understandable dislike of Republicans such as
Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, a man with the voice of a dentist's drill and a
personality to match, and come to terms with the crafty minority leader,
Senator Bob Dole, so adept at making trouble if not courted or cowed. As a
very practical politician, Mr Clinton should know about compromise.
Not that the Democrats are necessarily much easier, especially the new,
independent-minded freshman class. Of the barons, Mr Clinton already has his
hands full with the resentful Sam Nunn of Georgia on the gay question. Even
George Mitchell, the faithful majority leader, Pat Moynihan, of the finance
committee, and Dan Rostenkowski, powerful chairman of the House ways and
means committee, have started muttering disapproval about value-added taxes
and investment credits.
Nor has he yet found cruising speed with another important Washington
institution with the power to wound - big media. The fact that he has held
only two formal presidential press conferences so far puzzles many because
Mr Clinton is so articulate when thinking on his feet, so much the
stimulating contrast to the men who went before him. Press relations with
George Stephanopoulos, the smart and influential communications director,
are frequently fractious, while lesser White House lights, schooled by last
year's electronically sophisticated election campaign, point out with scorn
that it is now technologically easier than ever to bypass the Washington
media establishment to get targeted messages across, which is exactly what
Mr Clinton does all the time.
Indeed Mr Clinton is still playing pretty well in the heartland through his
public speeches and other appearances, which repeatedly display his
extraordinary ability to explain the complex in comprehensible and sometimes
moving terms.
He is also making some serious friends at the state and local government
levels, not simply by loosening the federal purse strings but by actively
encouraging the sort of policy innovation that he feels appropriate for all
forms of government. This should be no surprise, given his record in
Arkansas and his recruitment to his cabinet of several members known for
their state, not federal, experience.
But going over the head of Washington, where much policy and even more
comment is minted, is risky, and in the capital his administration has
already been stretched painfully thin. At the last count he had nominated
barely a third of the approximately 3,500 senior political appointments in
his fief and many of these had still not been confirmed in office, a handful
because of the typically mischievous delaying tactics of Senator Jesse
Helms, the conservative curmudgeon.
But the real reason why this administration is barely formed is the
determination of the White House (not the cabinet secretaries themselves) to
follow the president's instructions and form a government that 'looks like
America' in its ethnic, gender and geographic diversity, all minus skeletons
such as illegal nannies in their closets.
The net result has been much resentment, some ridicule and, worse, the
occasional acute embarrassment. Whole departments, most obviously Justice,
have been mostly run by brand new cabinet officers assisted by Republican
hold-overs, unaccountable political advisers and career civil servants
without clout. This week's denouement in Waco found Janet Reno, the
attorney-general fresh out of Miami and in office for barely a month, very
short of institutional help, apart from a beleaguered FBI director assumed
to be on the way out. She was admired for immediately taking full
responsibility, Mr Clinton rather less so for waiting a day to say the buck
stopped on his desk.
From the outset it was clear that Mr Clinton, though comfortable in a
collegial environment, intended to take most of the big decisions himself.
He was involved, endlessly, in the nitty-gritty of the deficit reduction
plan, is becoming more immersed in healthcare and will take nobody's
recommendation on trust for the vacant Supreme Court nomination, especially
after two botched attempts to find an attorney-general. Cynics point out
that the last president to try and do everything himself was Jimmy Carter.
Foreign policy clearly interests Mr Clinton, as it does every president, and
his maiden voyage in it, to Vancouver with Boris Yeltsin, showed him at his
subtle best, artfully disguising that the Russian president was the
supplicant by apologising for submarine collisions and old but extant US
anti-Soviet trade laws. His speech before the summit, explaining why aid to
Russia was in the US vital interest, was among his most thoughtful.
But, mostly, the unwavering Clinton's external message is that US national
security in the post-cold war era must increasingly have a predominant
economic component, and his own involvement appears all the greater when
this element is to the fore - in developing US competitiveness, pursuing
more vigorous market-opening trade policies and assisting Russia. In
contrast to Mr Bush he appears to take no particular comfort in the company
of foreign statesmen, entertaining them either to businesslike lunches or,
in the case of Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, to a very
pointed lecture on the way the world had changed.
With the additional current exception of Bosnia, Mr Clinton has chosen to
leave most of the rest of routine foreign policy to his subordinates, under
Warren Christopher, the very capable secretary of state, while the domestic
agenda is being pursued. This neat division does not always work. The
Vancouver summit and its Tokyo follow-up also preoccupied Lloyd Bentsen, the
Treasury secretary, who knows more about twisting arms in Washington than
anyone. There was no one of equivalent clout left behind to lobby for the
jobs bill.
Mr Clinton seems perfectly comfortable in the presidency, relishing its
challenges, and the nation more accustomed to him in it, even if it still
harbours doubts about his character. The great question is whether this
one-man band (and his formidable wife) can keep it up, especially if the
domestic agenda, such as the budget and healthcare, gets shredded and if
foreign affairs refuse to be neatly compartmentalised offshore. It could all
end in tears, but for the moment, and for the next 100 days, too, there is
going to be more going on, for better and for worse, in America and its
capital than most other places, much of it because of Bill Clinton. That
would not have been predicted under George Bush.

FT  24 APR 93 / Lending fall shows demand still weak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SURPRISE FALL in bank and building society lending to individuals and
companies has underlined the fact that demand pressures are still weak in
spite of signs of recovery.
Lending in March fell by Pounds 1.2bn compared with the previous month,
after a Pounds 700m rise in February, figures released yesterday by the Bank
of England show.
Some of the seasonally adjusted fall can be explained by large debt
repayments in the manufacturing sector.
M4, a broad measure of money supply which takes in bank and building society
deposits as well as notes and coins, rose by 0.7 per cent in March compared
with February to show a year-on-year rise of 3.6 per cent.
Although this was higher than the year-on-year increase in February of 3.3
per cent, the figure is still only just inside the Treasury's 'monitoring
range' of 3 per cent to 9 per cent. That indicates relatively fragile demand
for credit.
The British Bankers' Association said that last month the nine biggest banks
which it represents received net repayments of Pounds 900m, after showing a
rise in lending of Pounds 200m in February. It said manufacturers had repaid
debts, on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, worth a net Pounds 1.4bn. This
was the largest figure since it started records in 1986.
The repayment was boosted partly by many businesses having large amounts of
surplus cash as a result of public expenditure, reflected in the large
government deficit last month of Pounds 9.5bn. Another factor which had
damped companies' need for borrowing was a run of rights issues.
Lending to individuals by the nine banks rose during the month by a
relatively high Pounds 1.1bn, even though the figure was magnified by March
being a month when quarterly interest payments become due.

FT  24 APR 93 / Retail sales show third rise in row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GROWING belief that economic recovery is under way in the UK was boosted
yesterday by the news that retail sales rose strongly last month.
At the end of a week of promising economic data, the Central Statistical
Office reported that shop sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent in
March compared with February, and were 4.1 per cent higher than in the same
month a year ago. The year-on-year increase was the sharpest for four years.
The rise in sales volumes followed a 0.1 per cent increase in February and
was the third consecutive monthly rise. In the latest quarter retail sales
rose by 1.6 per cent compared with the previous quarter and were 3.3 per
cent higher than the same three months a year ago.
The increase was more evenly distributed across the retail sectors than it
was in previous months, with the non-food sector beginning to catch up.
Non-food sales rose by 0.4 per cent month-on-month to stand 3.5 per cent
higher than a year ago, while food sales edged higher by 0.1 per cent
compared with February.
The British Retail Consortium, a trade body representing more than 90 per
cent of the retail industry, said it was particularly heartened by signs of
increased activity in sales of goods related to the housing market, such as
carpets and furniture.
Sales of household goods rose by 2 per cent in the latest three months
compared with the previous quarter, and were up 4.3 per cent on a year ago.
Clothing and footwear sales were also higher. They increased by 1.2 per cent
in the latest quarter compared with the previous one, and were 6.5 per cent
higher than a year ago.
The only sector to register a decline in the latest quarter was mixed retail
businesses, which covers most types of department stores. Sales dropped by
0.3 per cent in the three months to March compared with the previous
quarter, but were up 3.6 per cent on a year ago.
The value of retail sales in March was a non-seasonally adjusted Pounds
2.65bn, 6 per cent higher than in March last year.

FT  24 APR 93 / Forging industry remains sluggish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUTPUT from the forging industry continues to languish in spite of evidence
of improvement in the national economy.
Executives at the annual meeting of the British Forging Industry Association
yesterday reported that after a 9.3 per cent fall in deliveries last year
the domestic market remains sluggish while exports will be affected by the
downturn on the Continent.
The performance of forging companies is a barometer of manufacturing
fortunes. Nearly 55 per cent of forgings go to the car, commercial vehicle
and tractor sectors.
Mr Graham Mackenzie, chief executive of United Engineering Steels, which
accounts for about 45 per cent of UK production and exports 40 per cent of
its forgings, said the fall in European car sales was 'catastrophic'. He did
not expect recovery until 'well into 1994'.
He added that difficulties had been compounded in the truck sector by the
problems at Leyland Daf, the last volume producer in the UK, although the
receiver had resumed production at its Leyland plant. UES production this
year is running at a lower level than in 1992, Mr Mackenzie said.
Mr David Powis, director-general of the association, meeting in Droitwich,
Hereford and Worcester, said export deliveries this year had been stable.
Given the amount of orders from both foreign and domestic sources, he
expects national output to rise in the middle of the year.
The association said total deliveries last year were 158,794 tonnes - less
than 59 per cent of 1990's figure. Exports accounted for 18.5 per cent of
production.
Although executives have been encouraged by the growth in domestic car
production, the association said that 'a year of slow recovery, punctuated
with occasional setbacks, is the best that can be hoped for in 1993'.

FT  24 APR 93 / 'Greedy' house sellers prompt fears in north-east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEWCASTLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH-east England's estate agents are strikingly cautious about the
apparent recovery in the housing market even though they are delighted at
the increased sales activity of recent months.
Mr Stan Morville, managing director of Dollery Waller, which has eight
branches in Teesside and south Durham, is refusing to accept instructions
from would-be sellers who insist on an above-valuation asking price.
Mr Sam Smith, a Newcastle-based associate at Keith Pattinson, which has 33
branches in the region, talks with dismay of clients who have wanted to
increase the price of their unsold homes.
There are fears that over-eager sellers could throttle house recovery at
birth in a region with a big backlog of unsold properties.
Mr Peter Miller of Black Horse in Newcastle, who is also the national
housing spokesman for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, warned:
'The worst thing which could happen is for people to become greedy and
over-optimistic; the market is extremely price sensitive.'
In parts of the region pleasant homes in good order can be found for less
than Pounds 45,000; 60 per cent of Dollery Waller's sales in the first three
months of this year were under this figure. But Mr Miller said because
prices are now more realistic some first-time buyers are leapfrogging the
lowest rung and looking at properties in the Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 60,000
band.
He now detects virtually two markets; the unoccupied, possibly repossessed,
property which may need some improvement, and the good quality,
well-maintained home. It is the latter which are selling well.
Many agents would like more semis; Miss Ashley Hollingworth, at Whitegates
in Sunderland, said semis in coastal areas were in demand. 'People living
there want to stay.' In Newcastle, Mr Smith would like more larger, older
houses up to Pounds 150,000.
Underlying these perceived shortages is concern about the level of new
instructions. A few agents report a slight increase, under 5 per cent.
Others say the number is static.
Average selling times vary widely; Keith Pattinson has just sold a house for
Pounds 155,000, asking price Pounds 158,000, which had been on the market
two years. The sale of one semi in Redcar, Cleveland, was completed less
than a fortnight after Dollery Waller listed it. Mr Smith suggests three
months as an average selling time.
With agents pushing for realistic asking prices, and the market looking more
active, many discounts are now fairly modest; on average, agents suggest, no
more than 5 per cent on properties under Pounds 45,000, rising possibly to
10 per cent higher up the scale.

FT  24 APR 93 / Midlands finds talk of price rises 'nonsensical'

AT LEAST there is a housing market now - there was not in the autumn and the
winter, said Mr Peter Veitch, a partner at Hadleigh Steven Viney, the
Birmingham estate agent. 'But we're quieter now than we were six weeks ago.
That throws me slightly. It was a quiet Easter. It's quiet now.'
The driving force behind the market is the growing demand for homes at low
and medium-price levels, agreed estate agents in the west Midlands. By that
they mean prices up to Pounds 100,000.
In the first quarter Dixons saw the number of its transactions running 15
per cent higher than last year. 'The most interesting phenomenon,' said Mr
Bob Scarff, the managing director, 'is that we're seeing more of people
selling for the first time and staying in the buying market.'
Mr Philip Amphlett, managing director of Andrew Grant, said: 'People have
been buying for the last four years out of necessity. Now we're getting
people who are encouraged enough to start trading up again.'
But agents can find little evidence to support building society surveys
suggesting an increase in prices. 'To suggest prices have gone up by over 1
per cent in a month is nonsensical,' Mr Veitch said.
To some extent the slack appears to be tightening. Agents have much the same
amount of stock as they had three months ago. Mr Les Hill, business manager
of Birmingham Midshires Property Services, said: 'In available properties
we're probably keeping pace with what we started the year with. We have been
instructed on more properties, but then we have sold more.'
But this is not a sellers' market. Buyers are 'very canny indeed', Mr Veitch
said.
Mr John Allen, area director of Shipways, Royal Life Estates, said: 'Offers
are still coming in below the asking price. We're trying to get our vendors
realistic: it's supply and demand, isn't it?' He notes that 'under Pounds
85,000, sellers are less likely to accept a reduced offer. At the top end
buyers are less likely to offer the asking price.'
Mr Hill suggested that although 'there is a certain amount of chancing your
arm', most deals conclude at about 10 per cent below asking price.
Of course, the asking price can change. Mr Scarff said: 'Typically houses
have been on the market three months before they're sold. But they're price
sensitive. You can have one that's been on the market a year, then the price
is reduced and it sells.'

FT  24 APR 93 / Studio apartment on south coast goes for Pounds 12,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRIGHTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST in Brighton is not right across the board but confined mainly to
the middle price ranges - flats of about Pounds 60,000 and houses below the
Pounds 120,000 mark.
Brighton has seen a strong surge of interest and viewing in the four months
since Christmas, a modest increase in sales over the same period, but prices
have yet to show any upturn.
Mr Andrew Garth of Austin Gray estimates that 80 per cent of properties in
central Brighton are flats. 'Prices at the peak for studio apartments
started at Pounds 25,000. A lot of these and one-bedroom apartments came on
the market. Many were bought with little equity. It is these that have
crashed, and where recovery is slowest,' he said.
'We sold a studio apartment two weeks ago for Pounds 12,000. Forget what you
may have read about prices dropping by 25 per cent. For cheaper properties
the falls have been more like 40 per cent since the top in 1988.'
His office is selling about five properties a week compared with two a year
ago. Selling time has come down from months to weeks.
At Fiveways, an out-of-town district of semis and terraced Victorian and
Edwardian houses, Mr David Andrew of Raymond Beaument said: 'I believe that
after London and Croydon, Brighton suffered the worst number of
repossessions in the south-east. These seem to be petering out.'
In Fiveways the state of the market does not seem as bad as that in the town
centre. A three-bedroomed house which would have sold for Pounds 100,000 at
the peak could now be bought for Pounds 75,000 to Pounds 85,000.
Mr Glenn Mishon of Mishon &amp; Mackay has an office between the bedsit and
apartment land of western Brighton and the leafy boulevards of Hove.
He said: 'We are doing double the business in terms of sales and viewings
that we were doing last year. There are three kinds of buyers. First-time
buyers who are looking to avoid the bottom rung and going for two-bedroom
flats while prices are cheap. People who went into rented accommodation when
they were repossessed, or could not afford the mortgage and want to buy
again now that mortgages are cheaper than renting. Finally, there are people
who want to trade up a little but not massively in case interest rates go up
again.'
Mr Mishon said properties between Pounds 60,000 and Pounds 200,00 were going
within weeks, but anything more than Pounds 200,000 is not moving.

FT  24 APR 93 / Non-EC trade deficit narrows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK'S trade deficit with countries outside the European Community
narrowed slightly last month, with export volumes starting to benefit from
the devalued pound.
In March the value of visible, or merchandise, imports from non-EC countries
continued to exceed the value of exports but by only Pounds 918m. This
compares with a visible trade deficit of Pounds 1.25bn in February.
Export values reached a record high of Pounds 4.7bn, suggesting that
companies are taking advantage of the lower pound.
The trend was backed up by a similar rise in the volume of exports. These
rose to a record high and were up 4.5 per cent in the three months to the
end of March, compared with the previous quarter.
Import volumes fell marginally month-on-month but were also 4.5 per cent
higher than in the three months to December. A 16 per cent increase in
import volumes compared with the same period a year ago was consistent with
evidence that the economy is recovering.
Excluding oil and erratic items, such as precious stones and ships, the
Central Statistical Office figures showed that export volumes grew by 5.5
per cent in the latest quarter compared with the previous one. Underlying
import volumes were up 3 per cent on the previous three months and 14 per
cent on a year ago. Trends in export and import volumes for non-EC trade,
excluding oil and erratic items, were rising at about 1 per cent every
month.
The figures, which account for just less than half of the UK's total trade
with the world, showed a big rise in the UK's trade deficit with North
America. This widened from Pounds 256m in February to Pounds 320m in March.
The CSO stressed that it was not possible to deduce from the figures what
was happening to trade with the EC. The first intra-community trade figures,
measured by a new method, will be released on June 22.
The balance of trade with Europe excluding the EC improved slightly on the
month, but the value of imports from these countries - mainly eastern Europe
and Scandinavia - rose by 31 per cent in the latest three months compared
with the same period a year ago. This compares with a 6.5 per cent increase
in export values.
Export growth has been concentrated in basic materials and food, drink and
tobacco. Import values have shown their strongest rises in basic materials
and manufactured goods. Imports of manufactured goods rose 23 per cent in
the three months to the end of March compared with the previous quarter.

FT  24 APR 93 / Building societies see steady upturn . . . but agents
disagree
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER EVIDENCE of a steady recovery in the housing market emerged
yesterday when building societies disclosed that the value of housebuyers'
commitments to buy mortgages rose for the second month running in March.
However, the reports below from FT writers in the regions show that many
estate agents in England and Wales see only a patchy recovery and are
cautious about house prices.
The rise in commitments emerged in spite of an announcement this week from
the rival Abbey National, the mortgage lender, that its commitments rose 60
per cent in the first quarter.
Net new commitments rose to Pounds 3.09bn in March from Pounds 2.72bn in
February and Pounds 1.55bn in January. However, the March figure was below
that of the same month last year, when it was Pounds 3.46bn.
Mr Mark Boleat, Building Societies Association director-general, said
reports of rises in activity suggested that lending would continue to
increase.
Mr John Wriglesworth, UBS analyst, said the increase in net new commitments
was significant in spite of the fact that the total for the first quarter
was only Pounds 7.36m compared with Pounds 8.43m for the same period last
year.
Mr Boleat said the rise in house activity had also helped societies to
increase their inflow of retail funds because individuals selling homes had
capital available.
Societies' net retail inflow in March was Pounds 249m, following an inflow
of Pounds 208m in February and Pounds 363m in January. The total for the
quarter at Pounds 820m was well up on the first quarter of last year, when
societies achieved an inflow of Pounds 266m.
Societies are worried that they face strong competition for retail funds
from the government's National Savings products and from equity products.
Last year's total retail inflow of a net Pounds 295m was well below inflows
in previous years.
Housebuilders have also reported significant increases in net reservations -
agreed sales on which a deposit has been paid less any cancellations. A
survey of 15 of the country's largest builders conducted by the
Housebuilders Federation showed that net reservations rose by a third during
the first 15 weeks of this year compared with the corresponding period last
year.
The biggest rise in sales has been to first-time buyers. Recently there have
been signs that sales of houses in the medium-price bracket have also
started to improve, said Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, the
housebuilder. He said: 'The improvement is from a very low base and it is
still too early to talk of a sustained recovery. Nonetheless things are
looking better.'
The government has asked Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair
trading, to make the National House Building Council amend its structural
warranty scheme for new homes so that builders can use comparable
alternative ones.

FT  24 APR 93 / Unit trust funds at record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIT TRUST sales in March reached their highest level since the 1987 stock
market crash with funds under management reaching a record Pounds 70.7bn.
The UK's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism has led to
falling interest rates and increased share prices over the past six months.
That has attracted savers away from the building societies and into
equity-based investments. Unit trusts have reaped the benefit.
Gross sales in March were Pounds 1.75bn, the second-highest monthly total.
After repurchases from investors of Pounds 1.03bn, net sales were Pounds
719m. About half of the gross sales came from private investors, the rest
from institutions.
Funds in the UK growth and UK equity income sectors achieved the best growth
and net sales during the month.

FT  24 APR 93 / Revival in west remains fragile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HOUSING market in south Wales and south-west England has stabilised but
it is premature to talk of a firm recovery. Across the region more interest
is reported from buyers, but houses have to be at the right price to sell.
'Generally speaking there are more buyers around,' said Mr Peter Mulcahy,
principal partner of Peter Mulcahy, an independent chain of eight offices in
south Wales. 'Prices now are very realistically pitched, very much more
related to what people earn, and allied to that are the low interest rates.'
But Mr Carey Jones, director and general manager of Crown &amp; Co, which has 16
offices in south Wales, warned: 'What recovery there is is very thin. We
have better figures than in 1992 but not as good as 1991, which was not a
brilliant year by any stretch of the imagination.'
Mr Justin James, associate partner of Stags, an independent group of seven
offices in Devon and Somerset, said: 'The recovery is sporadic, although in
the cheaper price bracket there is more movement, reflecting the cheaper
cost of borrowing. Pricing is absolutely crucial and if something is
overpriced it becomes obvious very quickly.' Job security, he said, was a
more important factor now than interest rates.
Other estate agents confirm that the revival in the housing market is mostly
confined to cheaper properties.
Mr John Hiles, partner of the 13 CJ Hole offices in Avon, said: 'We are
seeing a lot more movement but it is in specific areas - the first-time
buyers and even second-time buyers, but mainly confined to under Pounds
90,000. There is some movement above that, but negative equity is beginning
to creep up as a real practical prob-lem.'
Houses for which estate agents have taken recent instructions, and are at
1993 prices, are beginning to sell quite quickly, especially new homes.
'Developers are more realistic than some sellers on prices,' said Mr Hiles.
'At one show home last weekend we had 120 visitors.'
But 'old chestnuts', as one agent called properties which have been on the
market for a year or more, will still not sell unless their prices are
reduced.
Agents report that offers are now closer to asking prices, provided that the
latter are realistic. Some estate agents are finding that there are more
good buyers around now than good properties. Mr James said: 'Across the
board there is not much property coming on the market, particularly of
country properties in the middle and upper ranges.'
As yet, there is no upward pressure on prices. 'There is no need or concern
that they are likely to rise because there are an awful lot of properties on
the market,' said Mr Mulcahy. Mr James said: 'Any building society which
says that prices have risen by 1 per cent should be sent on the next rocket
to Mars and left there.'

FT  24 APR 93 / 1,300 jobs go as Asda closes food factory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASDA, the UK's fourth-biggest food retailer, said yesterday it was closing
its Lofthouse food factory in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, with the loss of
1,300 jobs.
Workers had believed the business would be sold by Asda, but were told
instead they were being made compulsorily redundant. The factory, which
supplies all its output of sausages, bacon and meat products to the Asda
chain, will close at the end of July.
Lofthouse, which is Asda's only interest in food manufacturing, reported
losses of Pounds 2.5m at the last half-year results in December, and is
expected to report a loss of about Pounds 4m for the full year.
The company said there was little prospect of the factory moving into
profit, adding that Lofthouse was operating in a declining market with
considerable over-capacity.
'It's a sad but inevitable decision. We had to bite the bullet some time,'
said Mr Paul Dowling, Asda's corporate affairs director. 'It makes good
quality products but the costs are too high.' Asda tried to sell the
50-year-old factory but was unable to find a buyer.
Closure costs, including redundancies, fixed asset write-offs and losses
between now and closure are estimated at Pounds 20m, to be classed as an
extraordinary charge when Asda reports its full-year results in July. That
will be offset against the Pounds 69m extraordinary gain Asda announced at
the half-year following the disposal of its interest in furniture retailer
MFI.
Mr David Williams, national secretary of the GMB general union's food and
leisure section, said the closure was a 'hammer blow for the people of West
Yorkshire, which will lead to the devastation of the whole community.
'Only yesterday John Major was jumping up and down triumphantly over the
employment figures. Meanwhile, in the real world, jobs are still being lost
and Asda workers are paying the price of John Major's complacency.'
Pirelli, the tyre manufacturer, is to cut 700 car tyre production jobs at
its Burton-on-Trent plant and relocate production to other plants, primarily
Carlisle, the company's other UK manufacturing site.
The company said the redundancies were in response to the 'considerable
deterioration in demand in the European tyre market'.

FT  24 APR 93 / Mayhew hints at new Ulster talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POLITICAL settlement in Northern Ireland should not be based on simple
majority rule - and, if backed locally, needs to allow for future Irish
unification, Sir Patrick Mayhew, secretary of state for the province, said
yesterday.
In the first hints of proposals aimed at kick-starting talks on the
province, Sir Patrick also envisaged greater co-operation between political
institutions in north and south Ireland.
Speaking at Liverpool University, he included energy and transport policies
and water management as possible areas for co-operation.
Sir Patrick hopes to re-start formal talks with Unionists, nationalists and
the Irish government after the province's May 19 local elections. He is
drawing up outline proposals as a starting point for talks - ending a near
silence by the government on specifics of Northern Ireland policy since the
first set of round-table talks three years ago.
Sir Patrick balanced Unionist and nationalist aspirations and hinted
strongly that he supports a central demand of Ulster Unionist MPs - a
Northern Ireland select committee at Westminster. He also ruled out Britain
and Ireland having joint political authority in Northern Ireland.
The speech underlined the shift in Conservative thinking away from an
overtly Unionist stance, towards a 'neutral' role. But his plans may revive
Unionist fears that they have more influence to lose than gain from
re-entering talks.
The Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, called
the proposals 'a framework for the betrayal' of the province.
But Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, said he was
encouraged by the speech while Mr John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance
party, said the proposals displayed a sense of realism.
Sir Patrick said government systems based on simple majority rule 'were not
successful before and they would not be sufficiently acceptable now. Such a
system in a divided society could simply not be relied on to provide a fair
deal for both sides of the community or to command the allegiance of each.'
He said the current status of Northern Ireland as part of the UK would not
change without the consent of the province's population. But he added:
'Correspondingly, there is no prospect of an agreement precluding a
politically united Ireland if, at some future date, the public's view should
change.'
He added there was a new 'intensity' behind public calls for the resumption
of talks.

FT  24 APR 93 / Employers suffer sharp pain from the bad back: Reasons
behind the biggest ever health campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SINGLE biggest cause of absenteeism arising from a work-related illness
or injury is the bad back. It costs industry about 3m working days a year.
This has sparked one of Britain's biggest ever health and safety at work
campaigns under the slogan: 'Is your business at risk through sheer bad
handling?'
The Health and Safety Executive's campaign, launched tomorrow, is part of a
three-year project aimed at reducing back injuries, as well as work-related
complaints of the neck, shoulder and arms.
The executive says back injuries arising from workers lifting or carrying
objects account for more than a quarter of all notifiable accidents at work.
An average of 20 days off work is taken for each reported accident.
It adds that it is not only people doing heavy manual work who are at risk -
nurses lifting patients can be injured, as can office workers moving
equipment or even cartons of paper.
The statistics understate the extent of the problem, the executive says.
Many lifting and carrying accidents go unreported either because they are
relatively minor - but nevertheless disruptive - or because they are
cumulative and do not show themselves for years.
The Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1992 - which came into effect on
January 1 this year - spell out employers' legal obligations in preventing
back injuries.
They oblige companies to: avoid the need for manual handling involving a
risk of injury as far as is reasonably practicable; to assess manual
handling operations where such handling cannot be avoided; and to reduce the
risk to the lowest level practicable.
For small businesses, in particular, this may sound like yet more
Brussels-inspired bureaucracy and form-filling. The executive says a written
assessment is necessary 'only if it is too complex to repeat when necessary'
 -presumably to explain to an inspector.
Consultants offering advice on the barrage of new health and safety
legislation which came into effect from the beginning of the year should be
viewed with some caution. The executive has warned that there are expensive
and ill-informed cowboys about.
For companies planning to do their own assessments quickly and at minimum
cost, the executive advises asking: Do any tasks performed in the company
involve holding loads away from the trunk of the body, twisting, stooping or
reaching upwards?
Are loads heavy, bulky or unstable?
In the working environment, are there constraints on posture or are lighting
conditions poor?
Do tasks endanger pregnant women or call for special training?
Any part of the operation which would lead to a 'yes' answer will need
action if employees are not to risk being added to the statistics.

FT  24 APR 93 / Grey skies begin to clear for Major: Philip Stephens finds
the PM with a spring in his step as the woes of his party begin to ease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GREEN SHOOTS had appeared at last. The end was in sight for the
Maastricht treaty. Ministers ordered champagne in the bars of Westminster.
Mr John Major decided that it was time to start rebuilding his political
authority.
For the first time in recent memory the prime minister this week had a
spring in his step. After months of living in the shadow of his party's deep
unease over the recession and its divisions over Europe, he felt confident
enough to again set out his own agenda.
Sketching his vision of Britain's future in Europe, he abandoned the ritual
genuflections to the Tory Euro-sceptics which have blurred his message since
last autumn.
He dismissed the Maastricht rebels as victims of the nostalgia of empire.
His cruel image of Lady Thatcher, once the invincible Iron Lady, was of a
phantom grandeur - 'a clanking of unusable suits of armour'. It was time for
his opponents to catch up with Britain's place in the world - and in Europe.
Last night Mr Major underlined that he has turned his back on her economic
strategy - above all on the calculated indifference to manufacturing
industry which permeated the 1980s.
There would be no return to 1970s corporatism. But this government cared
about the manufacturing base, new technology, the trade balance. No one
could imagine his predecessor telling an audience of businessmen that
'everything we do has to be supportive of you'.
Mr Major's new-found confidence rubbed off on his party at Westminster. The
hard-core opponents of Maastricht will never be won over. But among the
silent masses on the Conservative back benches there was a sense that their
leader was beginning to look again like a prime minister.
The general presumption is that the economic recovery will pick up speed
over the summer.
Even if the recent falls in the jobless total prove temporary, the
employment market may stabilise more quickly than was previously hoped.
Consumer confidence should sustain the rise in retail spending. The pick-up
in the housing market should reinforce the trend.
The completion this week in the Commons of its committee stage loosened the
shackles of the Maastricht bill. There are hurdles still to jump - Lady
Thatcher is promising a deafening onslaught from the House of Lords. But the
treaty should be ratified by late July.
So it was hardly surprising that the prime minister, who has spent most of
the past year in headlong retreat, should decide that now was the time to
declare that the tide has turned. As Mr Major toured the television studios
one cabinet minister declared: 'It can only get better.'
Perhaps. But wise souls were counselling against premature euphoria.
The shape of the economic recovery is far from certain. At present it is
being driven by consumer spending. The rest of Europe is in recession.
Unless industry heeds Mr Major's exhortations to export and invest, the
risks of an unsustainable widening of the trade gap and of another upsurge
in inflation are obvious.
In the meantime, the government must find ways to meet the toughest limits
on public spending for a decade. Cutting the health and social security
budgets and curbing spending on the police and defence will not be without
political cost.
Then there is Bosnia. The US administration seems poised to threaten
military action against Serbian forces in the former Yugoslav province.
Neither the government nor the Tory party can predict the consequences of
Britain being drawn further into the chaos in the Balkans. No one doubts
they are potentially disastrous.
But after the crises of the past year it would be churlish this week to deny
Mr Major his celebration.

FT  24 APR 93 / BCCI has 'black hole' of Dollars 12.4bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIQUIDATORS yesterday warned of a Dollars 12.4bn (Pounds 8bn) 'black hole'
of unrealisable assets around the world in the collapsed Bank of Credit and
Commerce International.
Partners at accountants Touche Ross said they had realised only 4.5 per cent
of the bank's stated assets of Dollars 14bn. They expected further
realisations to total another 6.7 per cent. But they stood by their original
projection that creditors would receive dividends of 30p to 40p in the
pound.
The figures were announced as Mr Christopher Morris, one of the joint
liquidators to BCCI SA, released a report submitted to the Department of
Trade and Industry and circulated to the bank's creditors.
Mr Morris warned that he was studying the involvement of regulators -
including the Bank of England - in the supervision of BCCI. 'If there are
actions we can properly bring against the regulators we will bring them,' he
said.
The liquidators disclosed that they had launched a Dollars 10bn action in
the US at the end of last year against the National Commercial Bank of Saudi
Arabia, Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, and a third party. They are already suing
Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Whinney - now part of Ernst &amp; Young - former
auditors to BCCI, for about Dollars 8bn.
They also issued a bankruptcy order on Wednesday against Mr Nazmu Virani,
former chairman and chief executive of Control Securities, for personal
debts to the bank.
Other money is expected to come from a settlement negotiated by the
liquidators with the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholders in
the bank.
But Mr Fred Goodwin, another partner involved in the liquidation, said that
most of BCCI's stated assets in 1991 had been grossly inflated and that
billions of pounds had been 'deliberately removed' to a network of trusts
and nominee corporations.
Against realisations until January 15 this year of Dollars 719m by the
British liquidators to BCCI, liquidators' fees totalled Dollars 133.3m and
legal fees Dollars 37.3m. Total expenses were Dollars 280.4m.
Aggregated fees including figures from other liquidators to the bank
totalled Dollars 194.1m, compared with realisations of Dollars 794m.
Mr Morris said the sum included 'many millions of pounds' in work from the
consulting arm of Touche Ross, which developed new computer programmes and
systems to replace BCCI's 10-year-old systems.
The level of fees was attacked yesterday by Mr Adil Elias, chairman of the
BCCI Depositors' Protection Association and a member of both the UK and
Luxembourg creditors' committees. He said he planned to call on the UK
courts to appoint an independent auditor to scrutinise the figures.
Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney general, told the Commons yesterday that
the inquiry by the Serious Fraud Office into BCCI had so far cost Pounds
6,203,000.

THE National Union of Mineworkers is to mount a further High Court challenge
to British Coal's pit closure programme, claiming redundancy terms being
offered to miners at nine threatened pits are in breach of an assurance
given by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, John Mason
writes.
The NUM was yesterday given leave by Mr Justice Popplewell to seek a
judicial review of the corporation's voluntary redundancy arrangements at
the nine pits which form the second tranche in the closure programme. The
hearing will be heard on May 5.
The union is claiming British Coal is offering the maximum possible
redundancy payments to miners who choose to leave before the end of the
current consultation period over the pit closure programme.
However, miners have been warned that those made redundant after the end of
the consultation period will be eligible for only minimum payments.

FT  24 APR 93 / Press freedom bill fails to progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIVATE member's bill seeking to establish an independent press
authority made no progress in the Commons yesterday and has virtually no
chance of becoming law.
Mr Clive Soley, the Labour MP who is chief sponsor of the Freedom and
Responsibility of the Press Bill, repeatedly accused Tory backbenchers of
deliberately denying it the time needed to complete the report stage by
prolonging debate on an earlier measure.
His protests were ruled out of order by Dame Janet Fookes, the deputy
speaker.
Mr Robert Key, junior heritage minister, reaffirmed that the government was
opposed to the bill and said it needed further time to prepare its own
proposals. These would be aimed at securing a proper balance between press
freedom and the rights of the individual. Mr Key confirmed that the views of
the Calcutt committee and recommendations by the Commons national heritage
committee would be taken into account.

FT  24 APR 93 / Pirelli to cut 700 car tyre jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PIRELLI, the tyre manufacturer, is to cut 700 car tyre production jobs at
its Burton-on-Trent plant and re-locate production to other plants,
primarily that in Carlisle, the company's other UK manufacturing site, Lisa
Wood writes.
The company said the redundancies were in response to the 'considerable
deterioration in demand in the European tyre market'.
Pirelli, as part of a big restructuring programme in Europe, is
concentrating different types of tyre production into single specialised
manufacturing sites in national markets in order to reduce costs. Since 1991
the group has shed nearly 6,000 jobs in Italy, Germany, Spain and Greece.
The Burton-on-Trent plant will retain about 600 jobs in the continued
production of truck tyres and head office activities.

FT  24 APR 93 / Yemen opposition hopes to banish rule by the gun: The poll
may be dubious, but at least it's happening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON and ERIC WATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO heavy are the odds against Yemen's opposition parties, according to Mr
Abdul Rahman al-Jifri, outspoken president of the Sons of Yemen party, that
one wonders why he is bothering to lead his party into the country's first
multi-party elections at all.
Plucking from sprigs of qat leaves, the mild stimulant munched universally
by Yemen's chattering classes, Mr al-Jifri heaps accusations of electoral
trickery against the ruling coalition of the General People's Congress and
the Yemen Socialist party - respectively the former ruling parties of North
and South Yemen.
His own group, which he describes as liberal Moslem, is fielding 90
candidates in Tuesday's polls. It is among the biggest of the 40 or so
parties seeking a place in Yemen's first elected parliament since
unification in 1990. But Mr al-Jifri holds out scant hope for their
collective chances in the face of some characteristically robust Yemeni
politicking.
To cook the results, Mr al-Jifri alleges, the ruling parties are filling in
soldiers' ballot papers in advance. He says they are trying to contrive a
strike at the state television centre to deprive other parties of publicity.
But mostly, he says, they are buying votes with money, offers of jobs and,
in some cases, Kalashnikov rifles, a prize Yemeni status symbol and worth up
to Dollars 800 each.
The litany is barely finished before an aide enters Mr al-Jifri's long,
elegantly carpeted qat salon, replete with two giant water pipes and seating
for about 40, to hand him a slip of paper, which he reads.
'Apparently someone in a government car has been seen tearing down our
posters,' he says. 'A full colonel dressed in uniform. A black landcruiser,
plate number 4272. A government car. Amazing.'
But Mr al-Jifri, a veteran of violent campaigns against the British and the
communists in former South Yemen, looks most unamazed.
Just two weeks ago his son was interrupted from an evening bath by a loud
bang and a shower of gypsum. Someone had tossed a hand grenade at Mr
al-Jiffri's villa.
As he sees it, the party's work, as with other smaller parties, is to
establish the primacy of the ballot box as a means to political power in a
country where for decades guns, armies and tribal might, corruption and
subtle intrigue have held sway.
'We want to get one thing out of this,' Mr al-Jifri says. 'That the process
is started.'
The sentiment is echoed by Mr Mohammed Abdul Malek al-Mutawakil, a
softly-spoken university professor running as an independent. 'I'm not
standing in this election to win,' he says. 'For me what's important is that
we have to establish the tradition.'
But while international observers in Yemen say they are happy that the
government has set up a voting procedure which should minimise fraud -
complete with watermarked ballot papers and indelible ink to mark voters'
fingers - opposition candidates say this misses the point. And they allege
connivance between the ruling parties to stage manage the result from the
outset.
Constituencies were drawn up to favour ruling party candidates, they say.
'Independent' candidates, 1,200 of whom pulled out this week, were allegedly
placed in all 301 electoral districts to wrong foot the opposition. Most
important, they say, in a land of 80 per cent illiteracy, the state has
severely limited vital media slots to just two 15-minute broadcasts per
party.
Senior government figures have so far proved reluctant to discuss such
charges with foreign journalists, present in unaccustomed numbers to witness
what Yemen touts as the first free multi-party elections in the Arabian
peninsula.
But, whatever the truth to opposition allegations, they are at least more
free to air them than most politicians in neighbouring states. Yemen's more
than 100 newspapers are probably the Gulf's freest.
'In terms of freedom of expression we've achieved a lot,' says Mr
al-Mutawakil. 'But in terms of administration and good government we're
falling behind. We hope this election can make at least a start.'

FT  24 APR 93 / US slowdown in orders fuels Wall St fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Commerce Department yesterday reported a 3.7 per cent decline in new
orders for durable goods between February and March, fuelling anxiety on
Wall Street that the pace of US economic recovery is slowing.
The figures unsettled investors because they follow a string of weaker than
expected statistics, including sharp declines in retail sales and housing
starts last month and flat industrial production. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average ended the day down 15.40 points at 3413.77.
The decline in orders was the largest in 15 months and broadly based -
affecting transport, primary metals, industrial machinery and electrical
equipment.
However, the series is notoriously volatile. Orders rose 2.2 per cent in
February and by 3.5 per cent in the first quarter as a whole relative to the
fourth quarter of last year, which saw a robust expansion of orders.
Many forecasters have shaved their projections for the first quarter to show
growth at an annual rate of about 2.5 per cent, sharply lower than the 4.7
per cent annual rate registered in the fourth quarter of last year.
A pick up towards 3 per cent, however, is widely expected later in the year.
'The figures are consistent with a recent pattern of slower industrial
growth that reflects more than bad weather,' said Mr Edward McKelvey, a
senior economist at Goldman Sachs. The group projects growth of just over
2.0 per cent in the first quarter.
Mr David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities in New York, said he
had cut his growth forecast sharply partly because of the adverse impact on
the economy of the more rapid decline in defence procurement ordered by the
Clinton administration to make room for higher civilian spending.
The slow pace of job creation has also contributed to weaker consumer
confidence than envisaged at the end of last year when spirits were
temporarily lifted by President Clinton's election victory.

New Zealand exports increased by 9.3 per cent to NZDollars 18.67bn (Pounds

reported yesterday, Terry Hall reports from Wellington. The figures are the
latest to point to a strong improvement in the New Zealand economy, which
economists say is due to a more competitive domestic market and a sharp fall
in the exchange rate over the past year. New Zealand showed a trade surplus
of NZDollars 1.69bn in the 12 months to March 31, NZDollars 354m lower than
the previous year.

Jubilant Eritreans flocked to vote yesterday in a referendum certain to

Ethiopia by the United Nations in 1952, has effectively been governed as a
separate state since May 1991 when Ethiopia's marxist dictator Mengistu

Austria is likely to suffer a short period of economic stagnation this year,
with growth resuming at a modest 1 to 2 per cent next year, according to an
annual country study by the Paris - based Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD), Ian Rodger reports from Zurich. The
OECD sees unemployment, at 5 per cent, continuing to rise. Inflation, at 4
per cent, should soon fall because of the sensitivity of Austrian trade
unions to the risk to employment. The study says Austria has 'reaped the

THE World Bank has completed negotiations with Russia on a Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 600m) project to boost output from the Siberian oilfields, writes
George Graham in Washington.
The deal, still to be approved by the World Bank's board of directors, would
support Russian government efforts to revitalise the oil industry and fund a
programme of well upgrades designed to increase production by 33,000 tons a
day. This would raise Russia's national output by 3 per cent or Dollars
1.5bn a year, the World Bank said. The Bank is to provide more than Dollars
500m for the project, which will be co-financed by the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development. Additional funding is expected from national
export credit agencies.
The energy sector has been a focus for development projects in Russia
because of the potential for rapidly boosting export earnings by improving
the efficiency of the country's oil fields.

FT  24 APR 93 / UK civil servant powerless to halt EBRD spree: ODA man
supervising building was unable to prevent lavish spending on bank's London
headquarters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BRITISH civil servant 'lived a nightmare' last year as he watched the
lavish spending on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's
London headquarters, an official close to the affair said last night.
Mr Nicholas Bailey, a member of the bank's building committee and an
official at the Overseas Development Administration, was unable to halt the
spending of millions of pounds on replacing marble in its new head office,
redesigning the interiors of its lifts and installing curved wooden doors.
An official said Mr Bailey had no power to prevent the lavish spending,
because the bank's board had approved the building budget and the UK
government's grant of Pounds 40m for the EBRD's buildings was given to the
bank without any conditions attached.
Because the grant had been given, Mr Bailey was made a member of the EBRD's
building committee, set up to supervise work on the Pounds 55.5m fitting out
of its new headquarters at Exchange Square in the City of London. No public
official from any of the other 55 countries or agencies which own the bank
was on the committee.
The committee was chaired by Mr Pierre Pissaloux, the EBRD's director of the
budget and director of the cabinet of Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's
president.
At the end of 1991, the British government was involved in fixing the
original budget for the building at Pounds 53m. The EBRD set this budget
having employed the chartered surveyors, Gardiner and Theobald, as cost
consultants.
The ODA scrutinised the budget in conjunction with a retired architect, Mr
Alec Reilly, with whom it had worked before.
It did not believe the original specification for the building was too
luxurious. An official said the original plan was 'high quality, somewhere
between normal UK government standards and the more luxurious offices
normally occupied by international financial institutions'.
Chartered surveyors say the budget was generous compared to the fitting out
costs of many UK buildings. The cost is equivalent to around Pounds 70,000
for each of the EBRD's 750 employees, higher than for most City offices.
But the budget had to be approved by the board's directors, which represent
the countries and international agencies which own the bank.
Directors received only 'sketchy information' on the capital budget, said a
director, who regrets that he and his colleagues were not more forceful in
asking for more information. 'In some respects, we could have done our job
better,' he said.
Information on the building costs is contained in the EBRD's 1992 70-page
budget document. There is a one paragraph reference to the fitting out: 'An
allocation of Pounds 53m has been made in the budget based on the
preliminary view of the quantity surveyor requested to estimate the cost of
the fitting out works, including all the professional fees.'
Directors say they received no other documentary information on the building
costs of any substance. However at board meetings on 16 and 17 December
1991, they approved the budget.
The British government says it insisted that contracts for the building work
be awarded on the basis of normal procedures followed by publicly-owned
institutions of competitive tendering. These are the procurement procedures
which the EBRD insists that its customers in the public sector of Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union also follow on infrastructure projects.
However, in the appointment of French firm Berthet &amp; Pochy as leading
architects, there was no open competition, though the contractor on the
project, Bovis, did talk to four other architects practices before Berthet
was chosen.
Berthet &amp; Pochy had started to draw up plans for the building design before
they were awarded the contract, said a UK government official.
The EBRD wanted Berthet to be appointed, the official said. 'Architects are
often the choice of the client,' he said. He added that the UK government
'looked at the firm's credentials' and became convinced it could 'do the
job'.
Three years ago Mr Attali wrote the preface to a book on the work of Berthet
&amp; Pochy.
Because Berthet had already done design work and a public competition would
take at least two months, the government agreed that Berthet could be
appointed as the leading designer on the project.
When building began, the EBRD discovered that the costs of certain materials
were lower than it had anticipated in the budget. The savings were around
Pounds 5m.
But rather than save the money, the building sub-committee decided to make
the fittings and furnishings more luxurious. The UK government is understood
to have been alarmed when it learned of the 'excesses', according to an
official, but felt it could not intervene, since the board had approved the
budget.
An official listed several departures from the original specification,
including the shadowless carpet, specially designed desks, replacing the
lift interiors, replacing the original marble in the building and installing
a mural.
In the event, the spending got out of hand. Around the beginning of this
year the EBRD had to ask its directors to increase the building budget to
Pounds 55.5m. The British government sent a letter warning that spending
must now be more tightly controlled. But in the words of the official, the
horse had already bolted.

<TEXT>
THE Bank of Japan yesterday joined the rising chorus of Japanese criticism
of President Clinton's remarks a week ago which have fuelled the rapid
appreciation of the yen over the past few days.
A senior bank official said it was highly inappropriate that the foreign
exchange market should be moved by improper comments which were not well
thought out.
The official accused the US administration of toying with exchange rates
amid confusion in their ranks about the mix of policies needed to reduce the
US trade deficit with Japan.
President Clinton suggested a stronger yen was one of several factors
working to reduce Japan's trade surplus.
'There are some dangerous signs that there is too much toying around with
exchange rates,' the official said. If the purposal is to reduce the
international trade imbalance then the policy should be applied more
consistently and not undermine the efforts we are making to revive the
economy.'
He warned that the yen's rise risked stifling the incipient recovery in the
Japanese economy.
Japanese politicians and officials are torn in their response to the
currency's rise.
A string of leading politicians has attacked President Clinton's remarks
over the past few days. Mr Yoshiro Mori, the trade minister yesterday said
he felt 'extremely angry' at the way the US administration had talked up the
yen.
However, Mr Miyazawa and other senior officials have attempted to mute the
criticism for fear of further straining economic relations with the US which
threaten to become increasingly fraught.

FT  24 APR 93 / US 'will set' Japan market targets

THE US is determined to set targets on opening up Japanese markets to
American goods, Mr Ron Brown, US Secretary of Commerce, said in Tokyo
yesterday.
'We are very serious about a results-oriented approach and measureable
results and monitoring those results,' he said.
'The unfortunate fact of the matter is that despite the best efforts of our
two governments, the Japanese market is still not truly open to American
products.'
Mr Brown spoke against a background of US frustration at a bilateral trade
deficit in 1992 of nearly Dollars 50bn.
He is in Tokyo for an international conference on assistance to Russia. But
he arrived two days in advance for meetings with Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the
prime minister, Mr Kabun Muto, the foreign minister and Mr Yoshio Mori,
trade and industry minister, which will highlight the tough stance the
Clinton administration is adopting in its trade talks with Japan.
The Japanese side, so far, has maintained that any attempts to impose
quantitative targets will be vigorously resisted.
Officials at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry have also
tried to play down the implications of the tough rhetoric from the US by
emphasising that there has been no formal proposal from the US on targets
for specific sectors.
While Japan insists that the shape of a new framework for bilateral trade
talks has yet to be determined, the US has no doubts about what it is
looking for in the new agreement.
Mr Brown said that two new bilateral agreements will be drawn up to address
both structural and sectoral issues.
The US and Japan will work to remove barriers to market access in specific
sectors which the US considers strategically crucial. Success will be
measured by sales, he said.
He also cited the US-Japan semiconductor arrangement, which refers to a 20
per cent market share for imports, as one example of a successful
results-oriented approach.
Despite Japanese insistence that it will not agree to quantifiable targets,
Mr Brown was confident the two sides could reach agreement.
Reducing the trade imbalance was in the best interests of Japan too, he
said.

FT  24 APR 93 / Chinese work deaths at 15,000
</HEADLINE>

MORE than 15,000 Chinese were killed in industrial accidents last year,
reflecting extremely lax safety standards that prevail throughout the
country.
Official figures, released for the first time yesterday, confirm fears held
by such institutions as the International Labor Organisation.
Chinese officials blamed the high casualty rate - the figures showed a 3 per
cent increase on the year before - on 'negligence at some enterprises which
tried to gain higher output at the expense of worker's safety.'
Mr Sun Lianjie, director of the Ministry of Labour's safety bureau, said
China's economic boom - growth in the first three quarters exceeded 14 per
cent - and the commissioning of many new enterprises had intensified
problems.
'Some workers have never received proper training in labour safety and know
little about safety procedures or self-protection,' he said.
Mr Sun called for tougher laws and regulations to 'check the increasing
trend of fatal industrial accidents.' Among industrial fatalities were 9,683
miners. This was a decrease of 1.4 per cent on the year before.
At the end of 1992, 148m workers were employed in industry across the
country. Annual average wages reached Dollars 476, up 6.7 per cent on the
year before.
Road tolls were also published recently. Officially, about 60,000 people
died on China's roads last year, but the road safety authorities believe the
toll was probably much higher.
AP adds from Beijing: Chinese police have arrested 1,580 people on suspicion
of robbing tombs and smuggling the antiques found inside, an official
newspaper said yesterday. The China Daily said more than 3,100 artifacts
have been recovered.

FT  24 APR 93 / Tuberculosis 'a global emergency'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Health Organisation yesterday declared tuberculosis a 'global
emergency'. Unless immediate action is taken to curb its spread, the
resurgent TB bacillus will kill 30m to 40m people over the next decade.
'Tuberculosis is humanity's greatest killer and it is out of control in many
parts of the world,' said Dr Arati Kochi, manager of the WHO TB programme.
'The disease - preventable and treatable - has been grossly neglected and no
country is immune to it.'
The declaration came at the end of a WHO meeting in London, at which
emergency measures to combat the disease were discussed.
WHO aims to spend Dollars 20m over the next two years, helping developing
countries to establish effective national TB programmes. After that, it
says, Dollars 80m a year must be provided by aid agencies and development
banks to buy medicines and diagnostic equipment and maintain a modest
infrastructure.
Developing countries account for 95 per cent of TB cases and 97 per cent of
deaths. But TB, the forgotten terror of the 19th century, is beginning to
return even in Europe and North America; the number of cases in the
industrialised world has increased by about 20 per cent since its all-time
low in the mid 1980s.
The WHO says the reasons for the disease's resurgence include neglect by
health authorities and researchers, increasing travel and migration,
emergence of drug resistance and - most importantly - the deadly synergy
between TB bacteria and HIV, the virus that causes Aids.
HIV activates tuberculosis in people whose infection was previously inactive
and, conversely, TB accelerates the development of Aids in those who are
HIV-positive.

FT  24 APR 93 / Referendum fails to inspire St Petersburg: Russia's second
city is no longer a bastion of support for Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY were there again last night, as they are every Friday evening outside
St Petersburg's pillared city hall: 300 or so mainly elderly men and women,
voluble with anger.
A similar or larger crowd has assembled in the centre of Russia's second
city every week for three months to protest about an affair that has been a
central talking point locally in the run-up to Russia's national referendum
tomorrow: the disappearance of millions of roubles of pensioners' assets in
an investment scam.
Up to 450,000 of St Petersburg's 5m people are believed to have been hit by
the scandal, involving misappropriation of share vouchers by two self-styled
'investment firms' whose directors have absconded.
The affair has not enhanced the reputation of President Boris Yeltsin's
economic reforms, or of the city's mayor and one-time prominent Yeltsin
supporter, Mr Anatoly Sobchak. On the contrary: St Petersburg - Imperial
Russian capital, cradle of the October Revolution and traditional home of
Russia's intelligentsia - is not the solid bastion of support for the
president it was during the failed communist 'putsch' of August 1991.
Today, a mood of sullen apathy has descended on the city's moth-eaten
elegance, enlivened only by shrill cries from the president's multifarious
critics.
On one of the main roads Democracy Wall - once plastered with posters
proclaiming support for reform - has been taken over by fly-sheets urging a
niet vote tomorrow. In front of it throngs a crowd anxious to explain why.
'I'm not a communist but I'm against him,' says Tamara Afanasiva, 49, a
philosopher by training who now works as a travel agent.
'Yeltsin is a communist, a party hack, and is only in power now because he
carried a party card for 30 years. These people are stealing from our rich
country and selling it off. They're building capitalism on the backs of
people.' She hands over a leaflet showing a tottering Yeltsin, bottle in
hand, captioned sarcastically: 'Support the President'.
Over at the local headquarters of the Russian Communist Workers' party comes
opposition of a more predictable kind. 'There's absolutely no point in this
referendum,' says Mr Yuri Tereniyev, party secretary, sitting beneath a
brocaded banner portraying Lenin.
'No matter what the results are Yeltsin will use them for his purposes.'
In the face of these assorted barrages, St Petersburg's lively community of
artists and intellectuals, who overwhelmingly support Mr Yeltsin, has
something of a beleaguered air.
All this does not mean Mr Yeltsin will be defeated in St Petersburg; not
even his fiercest critics predict that. More likely is a very low turnout.
Perhaps the best pointer to the prevailing mood is the behaviour of the
increasingly unpopular Mayor Sobchak. He has complicated matters by adding a
fifth question to tomorrow's ballot asking whether St Petersburg should seek
the status of an autonomous republic - an attempt to give himself a freer
hand in introducing reforms and attracting foreign investment.
And this week, as the referendum approaches, has Mr Sobchak been manning the
barricades? No: he has been enjoying himself in London at the annual meeting
of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

FT  24 APR 93 / EC edges closer to tax on energy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE likelihood of an EC-wide tax on energy to combat global warming edged
closer last night as an even split withinthe Community turned into an 11-1
majority in favour of the principle of a carbon tax - still resisted by the
UK.
The six member states, led by Germany and the Netherlands, which have
virtually signed up already to the European Commission's proposal for an
energy tax, garnered support yesterday from the four poorest EC states and
from France, leaving Britain potentially isolated.
Environment and energy ministers of the 12 were last night still striving
for a compromise which the UK could sign up to, but fair distribution of the
energy tax burden has been agreed in principle.
The Commission's tax plan would raise the price of a barrel of oil
equivalent by Dollars 10 by the end of the century, with half of the levy
falling on all non-renewable fuel and half on its carbon content.
At yesterday's special ministerial meeting, a 'burden-sharing' formula was
agreed whereby the tax would be modulated to 'take into account different
levels of economic development and different levels of carbon dioxide
emissions of individual member states'.
This rough formula still leaves much to play for - and any final decison
rests with EC finance ministers, who will discuss the tax in June.
But it was sufficient yesterday to comfort the four poorest countries -
Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece - that they may be able to negotiate a
delayed phasing-in of the tax, and to reassure France that it can negotiate
to protect its nuclear industry, by changing its mix to penalise the fossil
content of fuel.
Britain, after consultations with the Danish presidency of the EC, was last
night pushing for a vague formula. This noted that several member states
regarded fiscal instruments as a 'significant contribution' to cutting CO
emissions, but merely urged the Community to make up its mind on an EC-wide
tax 'as soon as possible.'
'We are still considering in the UK what the way forward is,' said Mr Tim
Eggar, British energy minister.
Such a formula, senior Dutch officials said, would be 'worse than useless',
and if the ministers were to reach any conclusions, the UK's objections
should be recorded in a footnote.
'If they want another opt-out, that could not be acceptable on competition
grounds,' one said.
Mr Eggar, accompanied by Mr David Maclean, junior environment minister, said
yesterday that those countries which had changed their view on the principle
of the tax were still 'deeply unhappy with how those principles were to be
put into practice.'

FT  24 APR 93 / Central banks rush to defence of peseta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, MADRID
</DATELINE>

SIX central banks intervened on the foreign exchange markets yesterday to
buy the Spanish peseta after the currency plunged against the D-Mark inside
the European exchange rate mechanism.
The Bank of Spain, and the central banks of Ireland, Denmark, Belgium,
France and Germany, joined to support the Spanish currency after it fell
through its central rate against the D-Mark for the first time since
devaluing in November last year.
However, neither two rounds of currency intervention nor a rise in the Bank
of Spain's official interest rates, for the second day running, could
prevent a sustained speculative attack on the currency, pushing it to a low
of Pta74.05 against the D-Mark.
The unsuccessful attempt to maintain the peseta above its central parity
fuelled speculation that Spain might have to devalue it or to ask the EC
monetary committee to sanction the temporary imposition of exchange
controls.
The Bank of Spain was clearly attempting to avoid either option yesterday. A
devaluation would cripple the credibility of the Socialist government, which
is seeking a fourth term in elections scheduled for June 6. The prime
minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, last night insisted his government would
maintain the peseta's value.
The Bank of Spain kept its benchmark intervention rate unchanged at 13 per
cent yesterday, turning Spain into an outsider amid the general cut in
European interest rates that followed the Bundesbank's decision to ease its
official rates on Thursday.
The bank also raised overnight rates close to 16 per cent, having raised
them from 13.35 to 14 per cent on Thursday.
Yesterday's operations by Europe's central banks came at the end of a week
which has seen the Bank of Spain consistently spending its reserves in
support of the peseta. Dealers remain uncertain as to how much the Spanish
authorities have spent in recent days.
There were rumours yesterday that reserves had fallen by more than 50 per
cent, coming down as low as Dollars 20bn (Pounds 12.9bn), against a reserve
volume quoted earlier this month of Dollars 45bn.
Operators in the London foreign exchange market believed a devaluation of
the peseta would not have a knock-on effect on the ERM as a whole.
Mr Steve Hannah, a director of IBJ International, said: 'At this stage the
market would not see a peseta devaluation as a reason for another attack on
the ERM.' He believes the falls in French and Danish money market rates in
recent weeks are a sign of growing confidence in the hard core of the
system.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of France yesterday shaved 0.25 of a percentage point off both its
official interest rates, bringing its intervention rate down to 8.50 per
cent and its 5-10 day 'repurchase' lending rate down to 9.50 per cent.
Virtually all the country's big commercial banks responded swiftly by
cutting their base rates from 9.75 per cent to 9.50.
Earlier, Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, discussed with employers
and union leaders the tough fiscal measures he plans next month.
But the day-long talks were inconclusive, with the prime minister seeking
and getting no more than the acquiescence of the two sides of French
industry that serious measures were needed to save the country's social
security and pension schemes from bankruptcy.
The French central bank acknowledged yesterday that it had taken part in the
general move to support the beleaguered Spanish currency by buying an
undisclosed quantity of pesetas against francs. Despite such intervention
and yesterday's interest rate cuts, the franc held steady.
Meanwhile, farmers in south west France and fishermen in Brittany yesterday
said they would resume their protests this weekend, or next, against sliding
prices of fruit and vegetables and cheap fish imports.
Hugh Carnegy in Stockholm adds: The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, lowered
its marginal rate by 0.25 of a percentage point from 9.75 to 9.5 per cent.
Norges Bank, Norway's central bank, also cut its key overnight lending rate
0.25 of a point, from 8.25 to 8.0 per cent.

FT  24 APR 93 / US should not intervene alone in Bosnia, says Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton said yesterday the US should not intervene in Bosnia
without the support of its allies, despite the mounting pressure on the
administration to take some kind of military action against the Bosnian
Serbs.
Mr Clinton said he expected the administration's review of US policy on
Bosnia to be completed within the next few days. 'I do not think we should
act alone, unilaterally, nor do I think we will have to,' he said.
The president repeated that he had not ruled out any option for action,
except the direct intervention in Bosnia by US ground troops and that he had
high hopes of reaching agreement on joint action with Britain, France and
other European allies.
The debate in the US administration over the right course of action in
Bosnia broke into the open yesterday, with the US ambassador to the United
Nations urging Mr Clinton to order air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs to
help the hard-pressed Moslem population.
The ambassador, Mrs Madeleine Albright, is understood to have argued that
the US cannot turn its back on its international responsibilities and should
be prepared to act alone if it cannot persuade its European allies to join
it.
The New York Times also reported that 12 mid-level State Department officers
handling the Balkan region had implored Secretary of State Warren
Christopher to end 'western capitulation to Serbian aggression' and use
military force in Bosnia.
Mr Christopher has been reluctant to embrace military options and warned
this week that air strikes might halt the UN relief operations in Bosnia.
This argument against military action has also been deployed by Britain and
France, both of which have troops under the UN flag in Bosnia.
A similar debate also divides the Pentagon, where Defence Secretary Les
Aspin appears open to the idea that air strikes might deter aggression,
while General Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, remains
sceptical.
At the White House, Mr Anthony Lake, Mr Clinton's chief national security
adviser, is understood to be among those arguing for air strikes.
European Community foreign ministers will discuss the full range of military
and diplomatic options to end the fighting in Bosnia at Hindsgavl Castle,
near Copenhagen, today.
EC members remain as divided as the US administration, with the majority
leaning towards a tightening of new sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro.
President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia said yesterday that he had urged Mr
Clinton to call a summit of all the leaders of the warring factions in the
former Yugoslavia to resolve the Balkan conflict.
Meanwhile, the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament met behind closed doors
in Bosanski Novi, near the border with Croatia, yesterday, to decide once
again whether it would accept a peace plan brokered by the UN and European
Community mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen.
The Security Council has warned the Bosnian Serbs that, if they do not
accept the plan by April 26, draconian new sanctions against Serbia and
Montenegro, approved by the council last week, will be implemented without
further delay. Bosnian Croats and Moslems have already signed the plan,
which would divide Bosnia-Hercegovina into 10 semi-autonomous provinces.
However, the parliament was not expected to make its final decision until
after a meeting between its leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, and Lord Owen in
Belgrade later yesterday. 'We are trying hard to find solutions acceptable
for the Serbs after some modifications, some changes to the plan,' Mr
Karadzic said.
Lord Owen said a plan to create a UN-monitored corridor through Bosnia was
being discussed which would address a big concern of the Serbs.
He said the exact nature of the corridor, the size of the demilitarised zone
which would surround it and guarantees of international access to it still
had to be worked out.
Senior aides last night thought the zone would be about 700 square miles in
northern Bosnia - mostly in province 3, designated as Croat under the
international peace plan.
As the parliament met, a six-member UN Security Council mission headed for
Bosnia to make a first-hand appraisal of the war, amid calls from
non-aligned members of the 15-member Security Council for stronger action
against the Bosnian Serbs.

FT  24 APR 93 / Shortfall in G7's aid for Russia predicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIAL financial support for Russia this year from the Group of Seven
countries is likely to fall short of the Dollars 43.4bn (Pounds 28.1bn)
pledged at the recent G7 meeting in Tokyo, according to the Institute of
International Finance.
The IIF, a Washington-based economic research body founded by leading
international banks, believes that only Dollars 32bn of official western
support will be provided this year, largely because it expects International
Monetary Fund disbursements will reach only Dollars 4bn compared with the
Dollars 13.1bn IMF total agreed in Tokyo.
Mr Anthony Bottrill, IIF deputy managing director, said in London yesterday
that half the planned IMF standby facility of Dollars 4bn might be disbursed
this year together with half the new Dollars 3bn 'systemic transition
facility' that was agreed in Tokyo. The IIF does not expect Russia to
qualify for the Dollars 6bn rouble stabilisation fund first promised by the
G7 last year and included in the Tokyo package.
The IIF has calculated that western official support for Russia last year
totalled Dollars 17.55bn, compared with a promised Dollars 24bn. While the
Dollars 1bn of finance supplied by the IMF was Dollars 9bn less than
projected, largely because of the non-activation of the stabilisation fund,
official debt rescheduling was higher than expected and made up most of the
shortfall.
But Mr Bottrill said capital flight from Russia undid the good provided by
western finance last year - an estimated Dollars 8bn in 1992, with funds
leaving Russia at a rate a rate of Dollars 1bn a month from the end of the
first quarter onwards.
As much as Dollars 1.5bn of flight capital may have flowed into Russia in
the first quarter of 1992, when tight fiscal and monetary policies were in
place. IIF economists believe capital reflows will only resume after Russia
has significantly raised interest rates and oil prices.

THE organisers of tomorrow's federation-wide Russian refenrdum yesterday hit
back at allegations that the ballot was likely to be rigged.
Speaking at the referendum headquarters in Moscow, Mr Vasily Kazakov, the
beleaguered chairman of the referendum committee, insisted that the
organising team was politically neutral and that they would try to ensure
that voting was carried out according to 'legal means'.
But with both the supporters and opponents of Russian president Boris
Yeltsin accusing the other of skullduggery, his words did little to defuse
the controversy that now surrounds tomorrow's vote.
This week the Russian parliament accused Mr Yeltsin of issuing sackfuls of
fixed ballot papers to polling stations.
Mr Yeltsin's supporters, for their part, yesterday claimed that pro-Yeltsin
groups were being intimidated in the many rural regions which are hostile to
Mr Yeltsin.
Speaking in Moscow, representatives from the pro-Russian 'Democratic Russia'
movement said that they would set up a legal 'first aid' telephone service
to report cases of fraud.
'There is a great likelihood of falsification,' said Mr Dmitri Katayev of
Democratic Russia, who claimed that although Moscow had now enlisted 7,000
observers, many rural regions were still critically short of observers to
oversee the vote.
With more than 100m voters registered and 96,766 polling stations, the
monumental logistics of the vote mean that guarding against fraud,
irrespective of political interference, will be, at best, an uncertain task.
Since the voting centres lack computers, the ballot papers will be counted
by hand, before the results are sent by telegram to Moscow. There could in
theory be 400m papers - each of the four referendum questions is printed on
a separate sheet - although many eligible voters will not take part. Mr
Kazakov yesterday admitted that many of the polling stations, which are
scattered across nine time zones, still lacked sufficient voting papers or
official placards.
Although the organising committee had hoped to ease the counting process by
printing the papers in different colours, the plan was dropped when they
discovered there was not enough ink in the country to do this.

WITH the death of Mr Guido Carli yesterday at his Spoleto home at the age of
79, Italy has lost one of the few great post-war servants of state.
In a distinguished career spanning almost 50 years in both the public and
private sector, he will be best remembered for his long term as governor of
the Bank of Italy from 1960-75. This was a key period during which Italy
became one the world's seven leading industrialised economies.
Yesterday the Italian establishment united in paying tribute to Mr Carli,
highlighting his integrity and his contribution to Italy's postwar economic
development. Trained as a lawyer and gaining the Military Cross during the
second world war, he joined the Bank of Italy in 1946. He took part in the
Bretton Woods negotiations setting up the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank, and was subsequently the first Italian executive director of the
IMF.
After leaving the governorship of the Bank of Italy, Mr Carli took on the
presidency of Confindustria, the industrialists' association, for four years
at a time of confrontation between management and unions.
In 1983 he became a Christian Democrat senator, and in 1989 treasury
minister. Here he was instrumental in boosting the treasury team, pressing
for Italy's inclusion in the European Monetary System and a start to
privatisation.
Although he gave considerable international credibility to the Andreotti
government's economic policies, he never hid his disappointment that so
little was done either to privatise or to reduce Italy's mountain of debt.

FT  24 APR 93 / British recovery worries Delors: Commission president sees
threat to Emu plans if other states leave ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR JACQUES DELORS, president of the European Commission, is becoming worried
that the UK recovery based on a floating exchange rate could undermine the
EC's plans for economic and monetary union, senior EC officials said
yesterday.
Mr Delors has expressed private fears that other EC member states may be
tempted to follow the British example of pursuing economic growth outside
the constraints of the European exchange rate mechanism, the Brussels
officials said.
In a speech at the Hanover trade fair last Tuesday, Mr Delors warned that
the credibility of the EC's monetary plans was 'under attack'. Admitting
that the Maastricht treaty's plans for Emu remained in doubt, he declared:
'If Europe were hit by further competitive devaluations the Single Market
would not survive.'
The European Commission was stunned this week when UK unemployment fell for
the second month running in March. The gathering UK recovery is all the more
galling to Brussels, which blames recent currency instability inside the ERM
partly on the delay in ratification of Maastricht in Denmark and the UK.
Mr John Major's pro-European speech in London on Thursday night has
mollified some of the critics, but one Commission official expressed
reservations yesterday about the note of triumphalism in his claim that
Britain was winning all the arguments in Europe, from promotion of the
Single Market to common agricultural policy reform and enlargement.
This week, Mr Norman Lamont, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer,
predicted that the UK would grow faster than its main European competitors
this year and next.
EC officials believe that in the medium term, the UK will pay a price for
its floating exchange rate in higher interest rates, higher inflation, and a
substantial balance of payments deficit. 'It is not a sustainable policy in
the medium term,' said one official.
But with unemployment in the EC expected to rise to more than 17m this year
and growth likely to be lower than 0.75 per cent, the officials acknowledge
the UK boomlet may enjoy short-term appeal elsewhere in Europe.
Consequently, the Bundesbank's decision to lower its discount rate by a
quarter point to 7.25 per cent and its emergency Lombard rate from 9 to 8.5
per cent was greeted with relief in Brussels, a sign that the German central
bank is sensitive not only to the deepening recession but also to the
economic squeeze on its neighbours, particularly France.

FT  24 APR 93 / Appeal court backs teachers' right to boycott tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLASSROOMS in England and Wales face a summer of disruption after Britain's
second-largest teachers' union yesterday successfully defended its right to
boycott the controversial national curriculum tests in the courts.
Mr John Patten, the embattled education secretary, now faces the choice of
an embarrassing climbdown, a rush to change the law or widely disrupted
tests.
The appeal court ruled against Wandsworth Borough Council, which brought the
action to prevent the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women
Teachers from boycotting the tests. Wandsworth will not attempt to appeal to
the Lords.
The NAS/UWT is already boycotting the tests, which are due to take place in
June. The two other biggest teaching associations, the National Union of
Teachers and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, who are also
balloting their members, are expected to join the boycott.
However, senior Whitehall officials yesterday appeared to play down
suggestions that the government would introduce emergency legislation to
outlaw the boycott.
Earlier this week a leaked letter to Mr Patten from Mrs Gillian Shephard,
the employment secretary, suggested that the government was preparing to
amend the employment bill to outlaw industrial action which would flout the
will of parliament.
Downing Street refused to rule out such a move. But officials stressed that
the idea was not under 'active consideration', reinforcing a general view at
Westminster that the government would have to ride out the present storm in
the hope that the teachers would eventually lose the sympathy of parents.
The appeal court ruled unanimously that the NAS/UWT's action was lawful
because it mainly related to the heavy workload that teachers would take on
to implement the tests, and was not politically motivated by opposition to
the national curriculum itself.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NAS/UWT general secretary, proclaimed the result as a
'scorching victory'. He predicted that an attempt to change the law would
meet 'open rebellion' from teachers.
Mr Edward Lister, Wandsworth council leader, said: 'All those concerned with
education should now move forward to greater agreement. Everyone
acknowledges that improvements to the curriculum and the tests can be made.'
Mr Patten responded in a speech to the annual conference of the Secondary
Heads' Association, by pointing out that governors and head teachers still
have a statutory obligation to implement the tests.

FT  24 APR 93 / Retail sales rise points to end of recession: PM pledges
full support for industry and exporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, ALISON SMITH and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THIRD successive monthly rise in high street spending all but confirmed
the end of Britain's longest post-war recession yesterday. It gave new
impetus to Mr John Major's drive to reassert the government's authority.
The volume of retail sales rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent
between February and March and was running 4.1 per cent above the levels of
the same period last year.
The figures, which follow news earlier in the week of another surprise fall
in unemployment and a sharp rise in new-car sales, coincided with separate
statistics pointing to a further revival in the housing market and exports.
Official figures on Monday are expected to mark the end of the recession by
reporting a clear increase in first-quarter gross domestic product.
In the second of a series of speeches designed to put the crises of the past
year behind him, the prime minister said the government would support 'heart
and soul' the efforts of industry and exporters to sustain the recovery.
Underlining the break with his predecessor's hands-off policy towards
manufacturing during the 1980s, Mr Major said: 'The government has a duty to
work with industry to help industry meet the challenge . . . Everything we
do must be supportive of you.' Addressing businessmen in Manchester, he said
Britain was now set for two years of 'solid growth'. The government, he
continued, was determined to help industry to achieve the 'competitiveness'
needed to expand Britain's industrial base.
Anxiety in Whitehall that the present gentle recovery might develop into
another consumer-led boom was reflected in repeated exhortations by the
prime minister for business to increase its efforts in export markets. He
agreed that 'the trade gap is still too wide'.
Privately, senior ministers were also cautioning against euphoria,
suggesting that they wanted to see increased consumer confidence matched by
rises in output and investment.
Mr Major told the businessmen: 'Winning back lost markets is the only
long-term policy for British industry - for the whole economy. And
manufacturing is the soldier in the front line of that struggle.' His
optimistic assessment followed a decision to move on to the offensive
against Tory opponents of the Maastricht treaty. Last night he repeated his
determination to keep Britain at the centre of the debate on the shape of
the European Community in the 1990s.
The prime minister's message on the economy was echoed by Mr Norman Lamont.
Campaigning in the Newbury by-election, the chancellor declared: 'Britain is
on the up . . . The recovery is here in manufacturing, in retail sales, in
exports and in confidence as well.'
The 4.1 per cent increase in retail sales in the year to March was the
sharpest year-on-year increase for four years. Compared with February, the
volume of sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent in March, the third
consecutive monthly rise.
The latest trade figures showed that improving exports cut the UK's trade
deficit with countries outside the EC to Pounds 918m in March from Pounds
1.25bn in February.

FT  24 APR 93 / Yeltsin plans strong presidency
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN presidential power will dominate every other institution of the
state if the country backs President Boris Yeltsin in tomorrow's referendum
on the country's future, Mr Yeltsin promised yesterday.
A poll published by Izvestia showed that Mr Yeltsin was supported by 57 per
cent of those who would vote on the first question - do you trust the
president? Voters were equally divided over the second question, on support
for Mr Yeltsin's economic programme. Voters will also be asked if they want
early elections for president and parliament.
Mr Yeltsin hinted he would push through the new constitution against all
opposition.

FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Dow result cheers chemical
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DOW CHEMICAL, the second-biggest US chemicals group, yesterday provided a
glimmer of hope for the embattled US chemical industry by posting
better-than-expected first-quarter earnings.
Although Dow's underlying first-quarter profits dropped 28 per cent to 47
cents a share, they were significantly above the 30 cents Wall Street had
anticipated. Dow's shares climbed Dollars 3 1/8 to close at Dollars 56 in
New York yesterday.
Mr Leonard Bogner, senior chemical analyst at Prudential Securities,
attributed the unexpectedly strong results to 'a recovery in Dow's
traditional commodity chemicals and plastics operations, plus a profit
contribution from Europe. Most analysts had expected European operations to
be in the red.
Mr Bogner said: 'While the numbers do not suggest that the chemical cycle is
booming, we believe that they do suggest the erosion in profitability is
over for chemicals. We would anticipate a slow recovery for the rest of 1993
and some big improvements in earnings in 1994 and 1995.'
Special items in the 1993 and 1992 quarters muddied Dow's balance sheet.
In the latest quarter, Dow had net earnings of Dollars 402m, or Dollars
1.47, including a one-time gain of Dollars 450m, or Dollars 1, from the sale
of its 50 per cent stake in Dowell Schlumberger.
A year earlier, Dow posted a net deficit of Dollars 587m, or Dollars 2.17,
including charges of Dollars 765m for accounting changes.
Sales in the 1993 quarter slipped 6 per cent to Dollars 4.4bn from Dollars
4.6bn.
Operating income from chemicals and performance products soared 66 per cent
in the latest quarter to Dollars 146m, due to widespread improvement in
earnings from most businesses in the segment which offset lower prices for
caustic soda. Sales were flat at Dollars 1.1bn.
Dow's operating income from plastics rose 4 per cent to Dollars 87m in spite
of a sharp drop in thermoplastic prices in Europe.
Dow said gains in polyurethanes, styrenics and fabricated products led the
advance in operating income. Sales slipped 2 per cent to Dollars 1.6bn.
The company's hydrocarbons and energy business narrowed its operating loss
to Dollars 7m, from Dollars 31m, on flat sales of Dollars 384m.
Consumer specialties saw operating earnings plunge 52 per cent to Dollars
162m on a 15 per cent decline in sales to Dollars 1.3bn.
Marion Merrell Dow, the pharmaceuticals company 70 per cent owned by
Dow,posted sharply lower sales and operating income in the period.

FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: MCI edges ahead of competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MCI Communications, the second-largest US long-distance telecommunications
company, yesterday showed strong growth in traffic and operating earnings as
it reported a 7 per cent increase in first-quarter net income after
extraordinary items.
The company, which is involved in a fierce marketing war with long-distance
rivals AT&amp;T and Sprint, reported a 13.6 per cent increase in traffic
compared with a year ago - well ahead of the industry average - and a 4.7
per cent rise from the fourth quarter.
MCI said growth had come across all markets. It attributed this to new
contract awards from large business customers, new products, and its
strength in the consumer and small-to-medium business market, achieved with
innovative offerings.
Its Friends and Family plan, a discount programme in the consumer market,

FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Freegold output behind Anglo
American climb

<TEXT>
IMPROVED gold output from the Freegold mine helped the gold mining
operations of South Africa's Anglo American group to record a 3.5 per cent
increase in attributable profits to R209.8m (Dollars 66.2m) in the three
months to the end of March, from R202.7m in the December quarter.
Anglo American, the world's largest gold producer, lifted production by 1
per cent to 67,091kg from 66,399kg in the previous quarter. The average
revenue rose by 2 per cent to R34,705 per kg from R34,040 per kg reflecting
the benefits of hedging and a firmer gold price.
Total costs rose by 2 per cent to R1.79bn from R1.75bn, with average unit
costs 1 per cent higher at R26,731 per kg against R26,387 per kg.
Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of Anglo American's gold and uranium division,
noted that the attributable profits were 27 per cent higher than the
quarterly average in 1992 of R165m.
He was cautiously optimistic about the group's prospects. He said there was
more of a positive attitude in the market towards gold, and there was
'definite scope now for gold to move into the Dollars 350 to Dollars 370 an
ounce range.'
This would benefit Anglo American's mines, he said, as no mine, taking any
12-month period, had more than 50 per cent of its production hedged.
Freegold, the holding company for the group's Free State operations,
achieved a quarterly production record of 30,054kg, up from 28,950kg in the
December quarter. Its attributable profits rose by 22.8 per cent to R92.7m
from R75.5m on the back of increased production, lower unit costs and a 2.6
per cent increase in the average price of gold.
The group's Transvaal mines all performed solidly. Vaal Reefs's production
was virtually unchanged at 18,901kg, but attributable profits fell to R55.6m
from R61.8m as last quarter's figures included a dividend from Southvaal
Holdings.
The directors said Western Deep Levels had had its best first quarter in
years, but attributable profits dropped to R32.6m from R40.1m due to a
sharply higher tax charge.

BANCO SANTANDER and Banco Popular, the two pace-making Spanish banks,
yesterday released first-quarter results that maintained their positions at
the top of the domestic profits table.
Santander raised its quarterly profit to Pta22.3bn (Dollars 191m), an
increase of 8.1 per cent on the the first quarter of 1992, and Popular
posted a post-tax income of Pta13.7bn, 6.1 per cent up on last year.
Both banks reported a very positive operating profit performance that was
ahead of most forecasts. Santander declared Pta33.5bn, an increase of 15.5
per cent on the first quarter of last year, and Popular raised its operating
income by 16.5 per cent to Pta31bn.
Mr Emilio Botin, Santander chairman, said the results had been due to the
bank's growing international business. He said the domestic market was 'in a
difficult situation because of the economic recession'.
The bank has an extensive network in Latin America, where it has built up
its corporate banking activities in Mexico, Chile and Venezuela, and is the
main shareholder of the US bank First Fidelity.
Popular's balance sheet reflected the reduction of cash coefficient
requirements under new Bank of Spain guidelines, as well as the bank's
proven moderation over credits and its austere control of costs.
Endesa, Spain's partially-privatised electricity group, is to pay Pta27bn
for a stake of approximately 2 per cent in Germany's RWE utility.

COOPERATION Pharm-aceutique Francaise, a small French independent drugs
distributor, has emerged as the leading company in a consortium to make a
counter-bid for Office Commercial Pharmaceutique, France's largest drugs
wholesaler.
OCP is subject to a FFr2.12bn (Dollars 391m) friendly takeover from Gehe,
the German distribut-or.
CPF, with a turnover last year of FFr2.3bn, has concluded an agreement with
the Bourely family, which owns 15 per cent of OCP.
Under the agreement, the family can sell its shares in OCP and will not
participate in the consortium.
If the CPF bid is successful, the family will not sell its shares for two
years and can nominate a member of a three-man board.
One director will be appointed by CPF and the third will be chosen jointly
by the Bourely family and CPF. At the end of two years CPF will buy the
Bourely shares.

its result for the full year would be worse than in 1992, writes Christopher

Income after financial items in the first three months amounted to SKr7m
(Dollars 0.9m), against SKr34m in the same period in 1992, as sales dropped
to SKr1.61bn from SKr1.65bn. The biggest downturn was in its important

TANDEM Computers reported an increase in second-quarter earnings but failed
to live up to Wall Street expectations.
The US manufacturer of fault-tolerant mainframe computers said that although
sales picked up in the US, revenues continue to decline in Europe.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 11.1m, or 10 cents per share,
compared with Dollars 8.8m , or 8 cents, in the same period last year.
Revenues rose to Dollars 517.6m from Dollars 502.9m a year ago.
'Although we anticipated a weak quarter, the computer business exceeded its
profit goals, but our Ungermann-Bass networking subsidiary fell below its
revenue, margin, and profit targets,' said Mr James Treybig, president and
chief executive.
'For the seventh consecutive quarter, business in the US posted
year-over-year revenue growth, gaining 13 per cent over the same quarter of
the prior year,' Mr Treybig noted.
'Non-European international revenues showed modest growth. Although some
countries in Europe achieved revenue gains, revenues from the European
division declined.'
Tandem is one of many computer companies that is making a transition from
proprietary technology to open systems based on industry standards.
The company is also developing lower-priced, server products based on the
latest Risc technology.
For the first six months of fiscal 1993, revenues were Dollars 1bn and net
income Dollars 28.6m or 25 cents a share, including a Dollars 12.4m, or 11
cents-per-share gain from a tax accounting change.
In the first half of fiscal 1992 Tandem posted revenues of Dollars 957.4m
and a net loss of Dollars 85.8m, or 79 cents, after a Dollars 98m pre-tax
restructuring charge taken in the first quarter.

FT  23 APR 93 / Salomon Bros pulls parent to Dollars 65m loss
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SALOMON, the Wall Street securities house and energy trading group,
yesterday announced a pre-charge net loss of Dollars 65m for the first
quarter after its Salomon Brothers brokerage subsidiary fell into the red
because of short-term losses on its proprietary trading activities.
The total net loss for the group, however, came in at Dollars 102m because
Salomon took a Dollars 37m charge to cover the impact of changes in the
accounting of post-retirement benefits. In the same quarter a year ago the
group earned net income of Dollars 190m.
The news did not come as a surprise because Salomon warned in early March it
had incurred a large loss on its trading business during the first two
months of the year. The size of the shortfall at Salomon Brothers, however,
was smaller than expected.
In March Salomon said that between January and February it had lost Dollars
250m (pre-tax) at its securities brokerage operation.
However, yesterday, the firm said its loss for the whole quarter was only
Dollars 89m, and that included a Dollars 25m charge to cover legal costs
relating to the 1991 Treasury auction scandal.
The company would not comment on the specific numbers, but it appears there
was a significant positive swing in Salomon Brothers' trading positions
during March.
Large fluctuations in Salomon's quarterly earnings are not unusual, as the
company explained yesterday: 'Proprietary strategies frequently have
long-term time horizons, in some cases extending over several years. Because
proprietary trading positions are marked to market, fluctuations in the
value of these positions are reflected in quarterly earnings, so that
earnings volatility and occasional losses are to be expected.'
Helping to offset its trading losses, Salomon's investment banking and
commissions revenues were both strong in the quarter, reflecting heavy
demand for the firm's underwriting and client brokerage services.
Salomon's two other lines of business, the Phibro Energy division, which
trades energy-related and other commodities, and Phibro Energy USA, the oil
refining operation, are also prone to some earnings volatility.
In the latest quarter, Phibro Energy bounced back from its loss a year ago
to post a pre-tax profit of Dollars 6m, while Phibro Energy USA remained in
the red, reporting a loss of Dollars 13m amid continued weakness in oil
refining margins.

FT  23 APR 93 / UK hurdles remain for Maastricht approval

<TEXT>
THE finishing line is in sight for the British parliament's lengthy
consideration of the Maastricht treaty on European union. But yesterday's
completion of a marathon committee stage in the House of Commons does not
guarantee Mr John Major's Conservative government a problem-free run to
ratification.
Four more hurdles have still to be cleared, starting with the Commons report
stage which is likely to get underway early next month. Then will come the
second Danish referendum on May 18, quickly followed - if the Danes vote Yes
 -by what should be a comparatively untroubled 'third reading' debate. The
government has promised that this will not happen until after the Danish
result is known.
After that, the bill moves to the House of Lords where Euro-sceptic peers
spearheaded by Lady Thatcher, the former prime minister, and Lord Tebbit
will press the case for a Maastricht referendum, which the Commons early
yesterday rejected by a majority of 239 votes.
The Commons would have the power if necessary to vote out any unwelcome
amendments but this would require an additional debate that the government
wants to avoid.
Finally, if the measure is still on course, there is an outside chance the
government could trip up in an eleventh-hour debate on the treaty's social
chapter, due to come after Maastricht has been made part of British law.
The critical question at next month's report stage is whether the opposition
Labour party manages to engineer a vote on its amendment which would delete
the protocol containing Britain's opt-out from the social chapter.
This could be important as it is the only mechanism yet devised which might
force the government to choose between the social chapter and the treaty
without requiring at least some Tory Euro-sceptics first to vote explicitly
for the chapter.
The bill's passage through the Lords is arguably the least predictable
obstacle still in the government's path. This is because its rules of
procedure leave anti-Maastricht peers with virtually limitless scope to
delay it.
For example, any proposal can theoretically be voted on at the request of
just four peers. Hundreds of amendments are expected to be put forward, as
they were in the Commons.
In practice, the flexibility of the Lords rules is rarely exploited to its
limit. But with emotions running high and a passionate anti-Maastricht
campaign in prospect, the government may have to bide its time for a month
or two.
If all else fails, Tory Euro-sceptics could conceivably make a last-ditch
effort to derail the treaty by voting explicitly for the social chapter -
which they loathe - in a separate debate due to take place after the bill
has received Royal Assent. If they did so, Mr Major could be forced to
choose - as Labour hopes - between accepting the social chapter, from which
he took such pains to negotiate a British opt-out, and tearing up the
treaty.
Mr Major last night underlined his determination to keep Britain 'at the
heart of Europe'. He told a Conservative party dinner: 'Outside Europe
Britain can survive; inside we will thrive'.
Operating at the centre of the EC, the UK could press its case for a wider,
free-trade, liberal community which would in turn render irrelevant the idea
of a centralised European superstate, he said. 'The idea of a centralised
Europe had resonance in a Community of six. But for 12, soon 16 and
eventually 20 plus nations it is a grandiose doodle'.
Mr Major said Britain had to take its 'rightful place' in the world. 'Though
no longer a global power we still have global interests. We need to defend
them with determination but also with subtlety. We cannot afford to subject
ourselves to the despotism of nostalgia'.
